Modeling the Probability of Default in the Construction Sector: Factors of Corporate Governance,"In this paper, we have estimated the probability for default in large construction companies in Russia using the classic method for this purpose â€“ logistic regression. Our task incorporates testing corporate governance factors and analyzing the predictive power of the model with regularization (Lasso and Ridge). For the dependent variable, we tested four definitions of default and then compared them. The model was conducted on the basis of information from the SPARK, Rosstat and the Bank of Russia database for the period of 2007-2015 â€“ the final sample, after eliminating the outlying observations, consists of 4761 construction companies. The added value of the corporate governance factors is verified on the basis of comparison of the ROC-curves (AUC) and the I and II errors. Seven hypotheses were formed, some of which were statistically significant, using an assessment based on both international and domestic experience dealing with the influence of corporate structure on the company's stability. In particular, everything else being equal, the default probability of the company will be lower if the CEO is also a co-owner; whereas the default probability of the company will be higher if the company is a subsidiary. Note also, that, in fact, companies with a small board of directors overcome financial distress better (with a negative return on assets) in the Russian construction business. There was no confirmation of the hypothesis that older companies are less likely to default. Confirmed hypotheses give a new perspective to look at with a comprehensive risk assessment of large construction companies in the country. According to our estimates, corporate governance factors really improved the predictive ability of the models, and regularization methods confirmed the stability of these models. Using cross-validation, the robustness of the coefficients of the final specification was confirmed. This result may be of interest to a greater extent for banks, commercial investors and partners-contractors.",2017,
Neighbourhood level real-time forecasting of dengue cases in tropical urban Singapore,"BackgroundDengue, a vector-borne infectious disease caused by the dengue virus, has spread through tropical and subtropical regions of the world. All four serotypes of dengue viruses are endemic in the equatorial city state of Singapore, and frequent localised outbreaks occur, sometimes leading to national epidemics. Vector control remains the primary and most effective measure for dengue control and prevention. The objective of this study is to develop a novel framework for producing a spatio-temporal dengue forecast at a neighbourhoodÂ level spatial resolution that can be routinely used by Singaporeâ€™s government agencies for planning of vector control for best efficiency.MethodsThe forecasting algorithm uses a mixture of purely spatial, purely temporal and spatio-temporal data to derive dynamic risk maps for dengue transmission. LASSO-based regression was used for the prediction models and separate sub-models were constructed for each forecast window. Data were divided into training and testing sets for out-of-sample validation. Neighbourhoods were categorised as high or low risk based on the forecast number of cases within the cell. The predictive accuracy of the categorisation was measured.ResultsClose concordance between the projections and the eventual incidence of dengue were observed. The average Matthewâ€™s correlation coefficient for a classification of the upper risk decile (operational capacity) is similar to the predictive performance at the optimal 30% cut-off. The quality of the spatial predictive algorithm as a classifier shows areas under the curve at all forecast windows being above 0.75 and above 0.80 within the next month.ConclusionsSpatially resolved forecasts of geographically structured diseases like dengue can be obtained at a neighbourhoodÂ level in highly urban environments at a precision that is suitable for guiding control efforts. The same method can be adapted to other urban and even rural areas, with appropriate adjustment to the grid size and shape.",2018,BMC Medicine
Estimating Exposome Score for Schizophrenia Using Predictive Modeling Approach in Two Independent Samples: The Results From the EUGEI Study.,"Exposures constitute a dense network of the environment: exposome. Here, we argue for embracing the exposome paradigm to investigate the sum of nongenetic ""risk"" and show how predictive modeling approaches can be used to construct an exposome score (ES; an aggregated score of exposures) for schizophrenia. The training dataset consisted of patients with schizophrenia and controls, whereas the independent validation dataset consisted of patients, their unaffected siblings, and controls. Binary exposures were cannabis use, hearing impairment, winter birth, bullying, and emotional, physical, and sexual abuse along with physical and emotional neglect. We applied logistic regression (LR), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Ridge penalized classification models to the training dataset. ESs, the sum of weighted exposures based on coefficients from each model, were calculated in the validation dataset. In addition, we estimated ES based on meta-analyses and a simple sum score of exposures. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic, and Nagelkerke's R2 were compared. The ESMeta-analyses performed the worst, whereas the sum score and the ESGNB were worse than the ESLR that performed similar to the ESLASSO and ESRIDGE. The ESLR distinguished patients from controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.94, P < .001), patients from siblings (OR = 1.58, P < .001), and siblings from controls (OR = 1.21, P = .001). An increase in ESLR was associated with a gradient increase of schizophrenia risk. In reference to the remaining fractions, the ESLR at top 30%, 20%, and 10% of the control distribution yielded ORs of 3.72, 3.74, and 4.77, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that predictive modeling approaches can be harnessed to evaluate the exposome.",2019,Schizophrenia bulletin
Neural Decoding: A Predictive Viewpoint,"Decoding in the context of brain-machine interface is a prediction problem, with the aim of retrieving the most accurate kinematic predictions attainable from the available neural signals. While selecting models that reduce the prediction error is done to various degrees, decoding has not received the attention that the fields of statistics and machine learning have lavished on the prediction problem in the past two decades. Here, we take a more systematic approach to the decoding prediction problem and search for risk-optimized reverse regression, optimal linear estimation (OLE), and Kalman filter models within a large model space composed of several nonlinear transformations of neural spike counts at multiple temporal lags. The reverse regression decoding framework is a standard prediction problem, where penalized methods such as ridge regression or Lasso are routinely used to find minimum risk models. We argue that minimum risk reverse regression is always more efficient than OLE and also happens to be 44% more efficient than a standard Kalman filter in a particular application of offline reconstruction of arm reaches of a rhesus macaque monkey. Yet model selection for tuning curvesâ€“based decoding models such as OLE and Kalman filtering is not a standard statistical prediction problem, and no efficient method exists to identify minimum risk models. We apply several methods to build low-risk models and show that in our application, a Kalman filter that includes multiple carefully chosen observation equations per neural unit is 67% more efficient than a standard Kalman filter, but with the drawback that finding such a model is computationally very costly.",2017,Neural Computation
Exploration and validation of radiomics signature as an independent prognostic biomarker in stage III-IVb nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"There is no consensus on specific prognostic biomarkers potentially improving survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), especially in advanced-stage disease. The prognostic value of MRI-based radiomics signature is unclear. A total of 970 quantitative features were extracted from the tumor of 100 untreated NPC patients (stage III-IVb) (discovery set: n = 70, validation set: n = 30). We then applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression to select features that were most associated with progression-free survival (PFS). Candidate prognostic biomarkers included age, gender, overall stage, hemoglobin, platelet counts and radiomics signature. We developed model 1 (without radiomics signature) and model 2 (with radiomics signature) in the discovery set and then tested in the validation set. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to yield hazard ratio (HR) of each potential biomarker. We found the radiomics signature stratified patients in the discovery set into a low or high risk group for PFS (HR = 5.14, p < 0.001) and was successfully validated for patients in the validation set (HR = 7.28, p = 0.015). However, the other risk factors showed no significantly prognostic value (all p-values for HR, > 0.05). Accordingly, pretreatment MRI-based radiomics signature is a non-invasive and cost-effective prognostic biomarker in advanced NPC patients, which would improve decision-support in cancer care.",2017,Oncotarget
Integrative analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation through oneâ€class logistic regression machine learning identifies stemness features in medulloblastoma,"Most human cancers develop from stem and progenitor cell populations through the sequential accumulation of various genetic and epigenetic alterations. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified from medulloblastoma (MB), but a comprehensive understanding of MB stemness, including the interactions between the tumor immune microenvironment and MB stemness, is lacking. Here, we employed a trained stemness index model based on an existent one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning method to score MB samples; we then obtained two stemness indices, a gene-expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) and a DNA-methylation-based stemness index (mDNAsi), to perform an integrated analysis of MB stemness in a cohort of primary cancer samples (n=763). We observed an inverse trend between mRNAsi and mDNAsi for MB subgroup and metastatic status. By applying the univariable Cox regression analysis, we found that mRNAsi significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) for all MB patients, whereas mDNAsi had no significant association with OS for all MB patients. In addition, by combining the Lasso-penalized Cox regression machine learning approach with univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, we identified a stemness-related gene expression signature that accurately predicted survival in patients with SHH MB. Furthermore, positive correlations between mRNAsi and prognostic copy number aberrations in SHH MB, including MYCN amplifications and GLI2 amplifications, were detected. Analyses of the immune microenvironment revealed unanticipated correlations of MB stemness with infiltrating immune cells. Lastly, using the Connectivity Map (CMap), we identified potential drugs targeting the MB stemness signature. Our findings based on stemness indices might advance the development of objective diagnostic tools for quantitating MB stemness and lead to novel biomarkers that predict the survival of patients with MB or the efficacy of strategies targeting MB stem cells.",2019,Molecular Oncology
Radiomics Analysis on Ultrasound for Prediction of Biologic Behavior in Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma,"Microâ€Abstract This study illustrates that tumor characteristics can be captured by medical images at the genetic and cellular levels. The data from 215 patients with breast invasive ductal carcinoma were analyzed. An automatic radiomics approach was proposed to assess the associations between quantitative ultrasound features and biologic characteristics. The results indicated a strong correlation. This application will be helpful for an accurate prognosis at an early stage. Introduction: In current clinical practice, invasive ductal carcinoma is always screened using medical imaging techniques and diagnosed using immunohistochemistry. Recent studies have illustrated that radiomics approaches provide a comprehensive characterization of entire tumors and can reveal predictive or prognostic associations between the images and medical outcomes. To better reveal the underlying biology, an improved understanding between objective image features and biologic characteristics is urgently required. Patients and Methods: A total of 215 patients with definite histologic results were enrolled in our study. The tumors were automatically segmented using our phaseâ€based active contour model. The highâ€throughput radiomics features were designed and extracted using a breast imaging reporting and data system and further selected using Student's t test, interfeature coefficients and a lasso regression model. The support vector machine classifier with threefold crossâ€validation was used to evaluate the relationship. Results: The radiomics approach demonstrated a strong correlation between receptor status and subtypes (P < .05; area under the curve, 0.760). The appearance of hormone receptorâ€positive cancer and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2â€“negative cancer on ultrasound scans differs from that of tripleâ€negative cancer. Conclusion: Our approach could assist clinicians with the accurate prediction of prognosis using ultrasound findings, allowing for early medical management and treatment.",2018,Clinical Breast Cancer
Convex Hull Approximation of Nearly Optimal Lasso Solutions,"In an ordinary feature selection procedure, a set of important features is obtained by solving an optimization problem such as the Lasso regression problem, and we expect that the obtained features explain the data well. In this study, instead of the single optimal solution, we consider finding a set of diverse yet nearly optimal solutions. To this end, we formulate the problem as finding a small number of solutions such that the convex hull of these solutions approximates the set of nearly optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm consists of two steps: First, we randomly sample the extreme points of the set of nearly optimal solutions. Then, we select a small number of points using a greedy algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can approximate the solution set well. The results also indicate that we can obtain Lasso solutions with a large diversity.",2019,
Grouped gene selection and multi-classification of acute leukemia via new regularized multinomial regression.,"Diagnosing acute leukemia is the necessary prerequisite to treating it. Multi-classification on the gene expression data of acute leukemia is help for diagnosing it which contains B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BALL), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (TALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, selecting cancer-causing genes is a challenging problem in performing multi-classification. In this paper, weighted gene co-expression networks are employed to divide the genes into groups. Based on the dividing groups, a new regularized multinomial regression with overlapping group lasso penalty (MROGL) has been presented to simultaneously perform multi-classification and select gene groups. By implementing this method on three-class acute leukemia data, the grouped genes which work synergistically are identified, and the overlapped genes shared by different groups are also highlighted. Moreover, MROGL outperforms other five methods on multi-classification accuracy.",2018,Gene
ImmunoScore Signature: A Prognostic and Predictive Tool in Gastric Cancer,"Objective: We postulated that the ImmunoScore (IS) could markedly improve the prediction of postsurgical survival and chemotherapeutic benefits in gastric cancer (GC). Summary Background Data: A prediction model for GC patients was developed using data from 879 consecutive patients. Methods: The expression of 27 immune features was detected in 251 specimens by using immunohistochemistry, and a 5-feature-based ISGC was then constructed using the LASSO Cox regression model. Testing and validation cohorts were included to validate the model. Results: Using the LASSO model, we established an ISGC classifier based on 5 features: CD3invasive margin (IM), CD3center of tumor (CT), CD8IM, CD45ROCT, and CD66bIM. Significant differences were found between the high-ISGC and low-ISGC patients in the training cohort in 5-year disease-free survival (45.0% vs. 4.4%, respectively; P <0.001) and 5-year overall survival (48.8% vs. 6.7%, respectively; P <0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the ISGC classifier was an independent prognostic factor. A combination of ISGC and tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) had better prognostic value than TNM stage alone. Further analysis revealed that stage II and III GC patients with high-ISGC exhibited a favorable response to adjuvant chemotherapy. Finally, we constructed 2 nomograms to predict which patients with stages II and III GC might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Conclusions: The ISGC classifier could effectively predict recurrence and survival of GC, and complemented the prognostic value of the TNM staging system. Moreover, the ISGC might be a useful predictive tool to identify stage II and III GC patients who would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.",2018,Annals of Surgery
Predicting serum vitamin D concentrations based on self-reported lifestyle factors and personal attributes.,"Evidence supports the role of vitamin D in various conditions of development and ageing. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best indicator for current vitamin D status. However, the cost of its measurement can be prohibitive in epidemiological research. We developed and validated multivariable regression models that quantified the relationships between vitamin D determinants, measured through an in-person interview, and serum 25(OH)D concentrations. A total of 200 controls participating in a population-based case-control study in Montreal, Canada, provided a blood specimen and completed an in-person interview on socio-demographic, reproductive, medical and lifestyle characteristics and personal attributes. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem MS. Multivariable least squares regression was used to build models that predict 25(OH)D concentrations from interview responses. We assessed high-order effects, performed sensitivity analysis using the lasso method and conducted cross-validation of the prediction models. Prediction models were built for users and non-users of vitamin D supplements separately. Among users, alcohol intake, outdoor time, sun protection, dose of supplement use, menopausal status and recent vacation were predictive of 25(OH)D concentrations. Among non-users, BMI, sun sensitivity, season and recent vacation were predictive of 25(OH)D concentrations. In cross-validation, 46-47 % of the variation in 25(OH)D concentrations were explained by these predictors. In the absence of 25(OH)D measures, our study supports that predicted 25(OH)D scores may be used to assign exposure in epidemiological studies that examine vitamin D exposure.",2018,The British journal of nutrition
Voluntary HIV testing and risky sexual behaviours among health care workers: a survey in rural and urban Burkina Faso,"BackgroundVoluntary counselling and testing (VCT) together with a safe sexual behaviour is an important preventive strategy in the control of HIV. Although Health care workers (HCWs) are critical in the response to HIV, little is known about VCT and high risk behaviours (HRB) among this group in West Africa. This study aims to assess the prevalence of VCT and HRB among HCWs in Burkina Faso.MethodsWe collected data through a questionnaire in urban areas (Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso) and rural areas (Poni and Yatenga) among HCWs from 97 health care facilities. Urine samples were collected, screened for HIV using a CalypteÂ® test kit and confirmed by Western Blot. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the use of VCT services and with high-risk sex behaviour.ResultsAbout 92.5% of eligible HCWs participated (1570 out of 1697). Overall, 38.2% of them (34.6% of women and 42.6% of men) had ever used VCT services. About 40% of HCWs reported that fear of knowing the test result was the main reason for not doing the HIV test. Male HCWs (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), laboratory workers (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), those having two years or more experience (pâ€‰=â€‰0.03), and those who had multiple partners (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) were more likely to have tested for HIV. One fifth of HCWs reported multiple partners. Of these, thirteen percent did not use condoms. HCWs who had multiple partners were significantly more likely to be men, single, living in rural areas, and under the age of 29Â years.ConclusionVCT was still very low among HCWs in Burkina Faso, while HRB was high.These findings suggest that â€˜HCW-friendlyâ€™ VCT centres should be implemented, securing confidentiality among colleagues. In addition, refreshment courses on HIV risk reduction, counselling and testing are certainly required during the professional career of HCWs.",2013,BMC Public Health
AB0766 Bakers' Cyst and Tibiofemoral Abnormalities Are More Distinctive MRI Features of Symptomatic Osteoarthritis than Patellofemoral Abnormalities,"Background In knee osteoarthritis (OA) structural abnormalities can be present in all joint tissues and compartments. These abnormalities are not OA specific and co-occur in different joint locations. Which structural abnormalities can identify symptomatic OA is unclear. Objectives We investigated magnetic resonance (MR) abnormalities in the knee that can discriminate best between individuals with and without symptomatic OA. Methods The Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study is a population-based cohort including 6671 individuals aged 45â€“65 years, of which 1284 participated in a MR imaging sub-study. Structural abnormalities (osteophytes, cartilage loss, bone marrow lesions (BMLs), subchondral cysts, meniscal abnormalities, effusion, Baker9s cyst) at 9 patellofemoral and tibiofemoral locations were scored using the knee OA scoring system. Symptomatic OA in the imaged knee was defined following the ACR criteria. The relation between structural abnormalities on different locations within the joint was visualized by network graphs, constructed using R, by estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix using a lasso penalty, based on the pooled variance-covariance matrix across the entire study population. Logistic ridge regression analyses using a double cross-validatory approach were used to investigate which MR abnormalities discriminate best between individuals with and without symptomatic OA, taking co-occurrence of all abnormalities into account. Higher regression coefficients reflect better discrimination between presence or absence of symptomatic OA. Analyses were performed crude and adjusted for age, sex and BMI. Results In the sub-study (55% women, median age 56 years (IQR 50â€“61), BMI 30.0 kg/m 2 (27.9â€“33.0)) 177 participants had symptomatic knee OA. All MR abnormalities except for subchondral cysts were highly frequent both in individuals with and without OA. The network graphs showed relations between osteophytes within all compartments of the knee and between cartilage defects on different locations. Within the same compartment, osteophytes and cartilage defects were related. Baker9s cysts showed the highest regression coefficient (0.293) for presence of symptomatic OA, followed by osteophytes and BMLs in the medial tibiofemoral compartment (0.185â€“0.279), osteophytes in the medial trochlear facet (0.262), and effusion (0.197). After adjustment for age, sex and BMI, the same abnormalities identified OA best. The area under the curve of the logistic ridge regression model including all assessed abnormalities was approximately 0.7. The figure illustrates which abnormalities best identify symptomatic OA (A: Baker9s cyst, effusion, osteophyte in medial trochlear facet, B: osteophytes in medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau, C: BMLs in medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau). Conclusions Baker9s cysts discriminate best between individuals with and without symptomatic knee OA. Especially structural abnormalities as osteophytes and BMLs in the medial side of the tibiofemoral joint and effusion add further in discriminating symptomatic OA. Presence of Baker9s cysts may present as a target for treatment. Disclosure of Interest None declared",2016,Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases
Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator type methods for the identification of serum biomarkers of overweight and obesity: simulation and application,"BackgroundThe study of circulating biomarkers and their association with disease outcomes has become progressively complex due to advances in the measurement of these biomarkers through multiplex technologies. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) is a data analysis method that may be utilized for biomarker selection in these high dimensional data. However, it is unclear which LASSO-type method is preferable when considering data scenarios that may be present in serum biomarker research, such as high correlation between biomarkers, weak associations with the outcome, and sparse number of true signals. The goal of this study was to compare the LASSO to five LASSO-type methods given these scenarios.MethodsA simulation study was performed to compare the LASSO, Adaptive LASSO, Elastic Net, Iterated LASSO, Bootstrap-Enhanced LASSO, and Weighted Fusion for the binary logistic regression model. The simulation study was designed to reflect the data structure of the population-based Tucson Epidemiological Study of Airway Obstructive Disease (TESAOD), specifically the sample size (Nâ€‰=â€‰1000 for total population, 500 for sub-analyses), correlation of biomarkers (0.20, 0.50, 0.80), prevalence of overweight (40%) and obese (12%) outcomes, and the association of outcomes with standardized serum biomarker concentrations (log-odds ratioâ€‰=â€‰0.05â€“1.75). Each LASSO-type method was then applied to the TESAOD data of 306 overweight, 66 obese, and 463 normal-weight subjects with a panel of 86 serum biomarkers.ResultsBased on the simulation study, no method had an overall superior performance. The Weighted Fusion correctly identified more true signals, but incorrectly included more noise variables. The LASSO and Elastic Net correctly identified many true signals and excluded more noise variables. In the application study, biomarkers of overweight and obesity selected by all methods were Adiponectin, Apolipoprotein H, Calcitonin, CD14, Complement 3, C-reactive protein, Ferritin, Growth Hormone, Immunoglobulin M, Interleukin-18, Leptin, Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1, Myoglobin, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin, Surfactant Protein D, and YKL-40.ConclusionsFor the data scenarios examined, choice of optimal LASSO-type method was data structure dependent and should be guided by the research objective. The LASSO-type methods identified biomarkers that have known associations with obesity and obesity related conditions.",2016,BMC Medical Research Methodology
Efficient Forecasting of Electricity Spot Prices with Expert and LASSO Models,"Recent electricity price forecasting (EPF) studies suggest that the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) leads to well performing models that are generally better than those obtained from other variable selection schemes. By conducting an empirical study involving datasets from two major power markets (Nord Pool and PJM Interconnection), three expert models, two multi-parameter regression (called baseline ) models and four variance stabilizing transformations combined with the seasonal component approach, we discuss the optimal way of implementing the LASSO. We show that using a complex baseline model with nearly 400 explanatory variables, a well chosen variance stabilizing transformation (asinh or N-PIT), and a procedure that recalibrates the LASSO regularization parameter once or twice a day indeed leads to significant accuracy gains compared to the typically considered EPF models. Moreover, by analyzing the structures of the best LASSO-estimated models, we identify the most important explanatory variables and thus provide guidelines to structuring better performing models.",2018,Energies
"Simultaneous Analysis of Lasso and Dantzig Selector1 by Peter J. Bickel, Yaâ€™acov Ritov","We show that, under a sparsity scenario, the Lasso estimator and the Dantzig selector exhibit similar behavior. For both methods, we derive, in parallel , oracle inequalities for the prediction risk in the general nonparametric regression model, as well as bounds on the p estimation loss for 1 â‰¤ p â‰¤ 2 in the linear model when the number of variables can be much larger than the sample size.",2009,
On the Limit Imbalanced Logistic Regression by Binary Predictors,"In this work, we introduce a modified (rescaled) likelihood for imbalanced logistic regression. This new approach makes easier the use of exponential priors and the computation of lasso regularization path. Precisely, we study a limiting behavior for which class imbalance is artificially increased by replication of the majority class observations. If some strong overlap conditions are satisfied, the maximum likelihood estimate converges towards a finite value close to the initial one (intercept excluded) as shown by simulations with binary predictors. This solution corresponds to the extremum of a concave function that we refer to as ""rescaled"" likelihood. In this context, the use of exponential priors has a clear interpretation as a shift on the predictor means for the minority class. Thanks to the simple binary structure, some random designs give analytic path estimators for the lasso regularization problem. An effective approximate path algorithm by piecewise logarithmic functions based on matrix inversions is also presented. This work was motivated by its potential application to spontaneous reports databases in a pharmacovigilance context.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Inferring nonlinear and sparse gene regulatory networks,"Background and Objectives: Gene regulatory networks model the interactions among the genes and provide a decision rule describing activation and repression of each gene via various proteins. In order to be able to capture the complex gene interactions efficiently, it is imperative to develop algorithms that model the nonlinear interactions among the genes. This work considers the problem of inferring gene regulatory networks using time series data. A nonlinear model is assumed for the gene expression profiles, whereas the microarray data follows a linear Gaussian model. Methods: A particle filter based approach is proposed to estimate the gene expression profiles and the parameters are estimated online using the Kalman filter. In order to capture the inherent sparsity of gene networks, a least squares shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) based regression and model selection algorithm is proposed. Results: The performance of the aforementioned algorithm is rigorously evaluated for synthetic as well as real biological data sets arising from Drosophila melanogaster time series gene expression profiles. The results are contrasted with those reported in the literature. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm using mean square error (MSE) as the fidelity criterion. The proposed algorithm is observed to outperform the EKF in the scenarios considered. Conclusions: This work considered the problem of modeling and learning of gene regulatory networks using a nonlinear dynamical model. This represents a quite general modeling set-up. The gene network is modeled using a state space approach, and particle filtering is used for state estimation. The parameters regulating the interaction among genes are supplied by an online Kalman filter. Since the parameter vector is sparse, LASSO identifies the subset of these parameters pertaining to the relevant system coefficients. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed particle filter based approach outperforms EKF in terms of MSE.",2012,
Bayesian Analysis for miRNA and mRNA Interactions Using Expression Data,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules composed of 19-22 nt playing important regulatory roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation by inhibiting the translation of the mRNA into proteins or otherwise cleaving the target mRNA. Inferring miRNA targets provides useful information for understanding the roles of miRNA involving in biological processes which may result in diagnosing complex diseases. Statistical methodologies of point estimates such as the LASSO algorithm have been proposed to identify the interactions of miRNA and mRNA based on sequence and expression data. In this paper, we propose Bayesian LASSO and non-negative Bayesian LASSO to analyze the interactions between miRNA and mRNA using the expression data. The proposed Bayesian methods explore the posterior distributions for those parameters required in the model depicting the miRNA-mRNA interactions. For comparison purposes, we applied the Least Square Regression (LSR), Ridge Regression (RR), LASSO, non-negative LASSO (nLASSO), and the Bayesian approaches to four public data sets which have the known interaction pairs of miRNA and mRNA. Comparing to the point estimate algorithms, the Bayesian methods are able to infer more known interactions and are more meaningful to provide credible intervals to take into account the uncertainty of the interactions of miRNA and mRNA. The Bayesian approaches are useful for graphing the inferred eects of the miRNAs on the targets by plotting the posterior distributions of those parameters, and while the point estimate algorithm only provides a single estimate for those parameters.",2012,ArXiv
Structure learning with large sparse undirected graphs and its applications,"Learning the structures of large undirected graphical models from data is an active research area and has many potential applications in various domains, including molecular biology, social science, marketing data analysis, among others. The estimated structures provide semantic clarity, the possibility of causal interpretation, and ease of integration with a variety of tools. For example, one very important direction in system biology is to discover gene regulatory networks from microarray data (together with other data sources) based on the observed mRNA levels of thousands of genes under various conditions. The basic assumption is that if two genes are co-regulated by the same proteins, then they tend to have similar patterns at the mRNA levels. Thus it is possible to learn a gene regulatory network from microarray data if we treat each gene as a node variable and each condition as a configuration instance. 
Structure learning for undirected graphs is an open challenge in machine learning. Most probabilistic structure learning approaches enforce sparsity on the estimated structure by penalizing the number of edges in the graph, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem. Thus these approaches have to search for locally optimal solutions through the combinatorial space of structures, which makes them unscalable for large graphs. Furthermore, the local optimal solution they find could be far away from the global optimal solution, especially when the number of configuration instances is small compared with the number of nodes in the graph. 
This thesis tries to address these issues by developing a novel structure learning approach that can learn large undirected graphs efficiently in a probabilistic framework. We use the Graphical Gaussian Model (GGM) as the underlying model and propose a novel ARD style Wishart prior for the precision matrix of the GGM, which encodes the graph structure we want to learn. With this prior, we can get the MAP estimation of the precision matrix by solving a modified version of Lasso regression and thus achieve a global optimal sparse solution. By proposing a generalized version of Lasso regression, which is called the Feature Vector Machine (FVM), our structure learning model is further extended so that it can capture non-linear dependencies between node variables. In particular, the optimization problem in our model remains convex even in non-linear cases, which makes our solution globally optimal. We have also developed a graph-based classification approach for predicting node labels given network structures, either observed or automatically induced. This approach is especially suitable when edges in the networks contain multiple input features. 
The contributions of this thesis work can be seen from several aspects. First, it provides a probabilistic framework that allows us to learn global optimal undirected graph structures with a low polynomial (quadratic when the graph is sparse) computational cost. Second, the development of Feature Vector Machine theoretically enriches current approaches to feature selection and extends our structure learning model so that the non-linear dependencies among node variables can be captured. Third, a graph-based classification approach is developed for predicting node labels using the observed or learned network structures. Fourth, we provided empirical evidence for the proposed methods in gene regulatory network re-construction and gene function prediction, as well as multi-class text categorization tasks.",2007,
A Sparse Multiwavelet-Based Generalized Laguerre-Volterra Model for Identifying Time-Varying Neural Dynamics from Spiking Activities,"Modeling of a time-varying dynamical system provides insights into the functions of biological neural networks and contributes to the development of next-generation neural prostheses. In this paper, we have formulated a novel sparse multiwavelet-based generalized Laguerreâ€“Volterra (sMGLV) modeling framework to identify the time-varying neural dynamics from multiple spike train data. First, the significant inputs are selected by using a group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, which can capture the sparsity within the neural system. Second, the multiwavelet-based basis function expansion scheme with an efficient forward orthogonal regression (FOR) algorithm aided by mutual information is utilized to rapidly capture the time-varying characteristics from the sparse model. Quantitative simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sMGLV model in this paper outperforms the initial full model and the state-of-the-art modeling methods in tracking performance for various time-varying kernels.

Bayesian Subset Modeling for High-Dimensional Generalized Linear Models,"This article presents a new prior setting for high-dimensional generalized linear models, which leads to a Bayesian subset regression (BSR) with the maximum a posteriori model approximately equivalent to the minimum extended Bayesian information criterion model. The consistency of the resulting posterior is established under mild conditions. Further, a variable screening procedure is proposed based on the marginal inclusion probability, which shares the same properties of sure screening and consistency with the existing sure independence screening (SIS) and iterative sure independence screening (ISIS) procedures. However, since the proposed procedure makes use of joint information from all predictors, it generally outperforms SIS and ISIS in real applications. This article also makes extensive comparisons of BSR with the popular penalized likelihood methods, including Lasso, elastic net, SIS, and ISIS. The numerical results indicate that BSR can generally outperform the penalized likelihood methods. The models selected by BSR tend to be sparser and, more importantly, of higher prediction ability. In addition, the performance of the penalized likelihood methods tends to deteriorate as the number of predictors increases, while this is not significant for BSR.

Development of dynamic Bayesian network for the analysis of high-dimensional biomedical data,"Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from time-course expression data is a major challenge in Bioinformatics. Advances in microarray technology have given rise to cheap and easy production of high-dimensional biological datasets, however, accurate analysis and prediction have been hampered by the curse of dimensionality problem whereby the number of features exponentially larger than the number of samples. Therefore, the need for the development of better statistical and predictive methods is continually on the increase. 
 
The main aim of this thesis is to develop dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) methods for analysis and prediction temporal biomedical data. A two stage computational bionetwork discovery approach is proposed. In the ovarian cancer case study, 39 out of 592 metabolomic features were selected by the Least Angle Shrinkage and Subset Operator (LASSO) with highest accuracy of 93% and 21 chemical compounds identified. 
 
The proposed approach is further improved by the application of swarm optimisation methods for parameter optimization. The improved method was applied to colorectal cancer diagnosis with 1.8% improvement in total accuracy, which was achieved with much less feature subsets of clinical importance than thousands of features when compared to previous studies. 
 
In order to address the modelling inefficiencies in inferring GRNs from time-course data, two nonlinear hybrid algorithms were proposed using support vector regression with DBN, and recurrent neural network with DBN. Experiments showed that the proposed method was better at predicting nonlinearities in GRNs than previous methods. Stratified analysis using Ovarian cancer time-course data further showed that the expression levels Prostrate differentiation factor and BTG family member 2 genes, were significantly increased by the cisplatin and oxaliplatin platinum drugs; while expression levels of Polo-like kinase and Cyclin B1 genes, were both decreased by the platinum drugs. The methods and results obtained may be useful in the designing of drugs and vaccines.",2017,
The generalized LASSO,"In the last few years, the support vector machine (SVM) method has motivated new interest in kernel regression techniques. Although the SVM has been shown to exhibit excellent generalization properties in many experiments, it suffers from several drawbacks, both of a theoretical and a technical nature: the absence of probabilistic outputs, the restriction to Mercer kernels, and the steep growth of the number of support vectors with increasing size of the training set. In this paper, we present a different class of kernel regressors that effectively overcome the above problems. We call this approach generalized LASSO regression. It has a clear probabilistic interpretation, can handle learning sets that are corrupted by outliers, produces extremely sparse solutions, and is capable of dealing with large-scale problems. For regression functionals which can be modeled as iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) problems, we present a highly efficient algorithm with guaranteed global convergence. This defies a unique framework for sparse regression models in the very rich class of IRLS models, including various types of robust regression models and logistic regression. Performance studies for many standard benchmark datasets effectively demonstrate the advantages of this model over related approaches.",2004,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks
Construction and Validation of an Immune-Related Prognostic Model Based on TP53 Status in Colorectal Cancer,"Growing evidence has indicated that prognostic biomarkers have a pivotal role in tumor and immunity biological processes. TP53 mutation can cause a range of changes in immune response, progression, and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus, we aim to build an immunoscore prognostic model that may enhance the prognosis of CRC from an immunological perspective. We estimated the proportion of immune cells in the GSE39582 public dataset using the CIBERSORT (Cell type identification by estimating relative subset of known RNA transcripts) algorithm. Prognostic genes that were used to establish the immunoscore model were generated by the LASSO (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) Cox regression model. We established and validated the immunoscore model in GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cohorts, respectively; significant differences of overall survival analysis were found between the low and high immunoscore groups or TP53 subgroups. In the multivariable Cox analysis, we observed that the immunoscore was an independent prognostic factor both in the GEO cohort (HR (Hazard ratio) 1.76, 95% CI (confidence intervals): 1.26-2.46) and the TCGA cohort (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.20-3.18). Furthermore, we established a nomogram for clinical application, and the results suggest that the nomogram is a better predictive model for prognosis than immunoscore or TNM staging.",2019,Cancers
L2-Boosting algorithm applied to high-dimensional problems in genomic selection.,"The L(2)-Boosting algorithm is one of the most promising machine-learning techniques that has appeared in recent decades. It may be applied to high-dimensional problems such as whole-genome studies, and it is relatively simple from a computational point of view. In this study, we used this algorithm in a genomic selection context to make predictions of yet to be observed outcomes. Two data sets were used: (1) productive lifetime predicted transmitting abilities from 4702 Holstein sires genotyped for 32 611 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip, and (2) progeny averages of food conversion rate, pre-corrected by environmental and mate effects, in 394 broilers genotyped for 3481 SNPs. Each of these data sets was split into training and testing sets, the latter comprising dairy or broiler sires whose ancestors were in the training set. Two weak learners, ordinary least squares (OLS) and non-parametric (NP) regression were used for the L2-Boosting algorithm, to provide a stringent evaluation of the procedure. This algorithm was compared with BL [Bayesian LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)] and BayesA regression. Learning tasks were carried out in the training set, whereas validation of the models was performed in the testing set. Pearson correlations between predicted and observed responses in the dairy cattle (broiler) data set were 0.65 (0.33), 0.53 (0.37), 0.66 (0.26) and 0.63 (0.27) for OLS-Boosting, NP-Boosting, BL and BayesA, respectively. The smallest bias and mean-squared errors (MSEs) were obtained with OLS-Boosting in both the dairy cattle (0.08 and 1.08, respectively) and broiler (-0.011 and 0.006) data sets, respectively. In the dairy cattle data set, the BL was more accurate (bias=0.10 and MSE=1.10) than BayesA (bias=1.26 and MSE=2.81), whereas no differences between these two methods were found in the broiler data set. L2-Boosting with a suitable learner was found to be a competitive alternative for genomic selection applications, providing high accuracy and low bias in genomic-assisted evaluations with a relatively short computational time.",2010,Genetics research
A Markovian approach to distributional semantics,"This thesis, which is organized in two independent parts, presents work on distributional semantics and on variable selection. In the first part, we introduce a new method for learning good word representations using large quantities of unlabeled sentences. The method is based on a probabilistic model of sentence, using a hidden Markov model and a syntactic dependency tree. The latent variables, which correspond to the nodes of the dependency tree, aim at capturing the meanings of the words. We develop an efficient algorithm to perform inference and learning in those models, based on online EM and approximate message passing. We then evaluate our models on intrinsic tasks such as predicting human similarity judgements or word categorization, and on two extrinsic tasks: named entity recognition and supersense tagging. In the second part, we introduce, in the context of linear models, a new penalty function to perform variable selection in the case of highly correlated predictors. This penalty, called the trace Lasso, uses the trace norm of the selected predictors, which is a convex surrogate of their rank, as the criterion of model complexity. The trace Lasso interpolates between the $\ell_1$-norm and $\ell_2$-norm. In particular, it is equal to the $\ell_1$-norm if all predictors are orthogonal and to the $\ell_2$-norm if all predictors are equal. We propose two algorithms to compute the solution of least-squares regression regularized by the trace Lasso, and perform experiments on synthetic datasets to illustrate the behavior of the trace Lasso.",2014,
Appearance-based localization using Group LASSO regression with an indoor experiment,"This paper proposes appearance-based localization using online vision images collected from an omnidirectional camera attached on a mobile robot or a vehicle. Our approach builds on a combination of the group Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Histogram are extracted from omni-directional images, the features of which are selected via the group LASSO regression. The EKF takes the output of the group LASSO regression based first-stage localization as the observation. The indoor experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)
Regularized Estimation of Large Scale Gene Regulatory Networks,"When dealing with graphical Gaussian models for gene regulatory networks, the major problem is to compute the matrix of partial correlations. Based on the close connection between partial correlations and least squares regression, we suggest estimation of high-dimensional gene networks in terms of partial least squares (PLS) regression and the adaptive Lasso, respectively. In a simulation study, we compare the performance of the proposed methods in terms of their ability to estimate partial correlations and to derive the underlying network structure.",2007,
"Prediction of fatty acid profiles in cow, ewe, and goat milk by mid-infrared spectrometry.","Mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometry was used to estimate the fatty acid (FA) composition in cow, ewe, and goat milk. The objectives were to compare different statistical approaches with wavelength selection to predict the milk FA composition from MIR spectra, and to develop equations for FA in cow, goat, and ewe milk. In total, a set of 349 cow milk samples, 200 ewe milk samples, and 332 goat milk samples were both analyzed by MIR and by gas chromatography, the reference method. A broad FA variability was ensured by using milk from different breeds and feeding systems. The methods studied were partial least squares regression (PLS), first-derivative pretreatment + PLS, genetic algorithm + PLS, wavelets + PLS, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO), and elastic net. The best results were obtained with PLS, genetic algorithm + PLS and first derivative + PLS. The residual standard deviation and the coefficient of determination in external validation were used to characterize the equations and to retain the best for each FA in each species. In all cases, the predictions were of better quality for FA found at medium to high concentrations (i.e., for saturated FA and some monounsaturated FA with a coefficient of determination in external validation >0.90). The conversion of the FA expressed in grams per 100mL of milk to grams per 100g of FA was possible with a small loss of accuracy for some FA.",2014,Journal of dairy science
A machine learning pipeline for internal anatomical landmark embedding based on a patient surface model,"PurposeWith the recent introduction of fully assisting scanner technologies by Siemens Healthineers (Erlangen, Germany), a patient surface model was introduced to the diagnostic imaging device market. Such a patient representation can be used to automate and accelerate the clinical imaging workflow, manage patient dose, and provide navigation assistance for computed tomography diagnostic imaging. In addition to diagnostic imaging, a patient surface model has also tremendous potential to simplify interventional imaging. For example, if the anatomy of a patient was known, a robotic angiography system could be automatically positioned such that the organ of interest is positioned in the systemâ€™s iso-center offering a good and flexible view on the underlying patient anatomy quickly and without any additional X-ray dose.MethodTo enable such functionality in a clinical context with sufficiently high accuracy, we present an extension of our previous patient surface model by adding internal anatomical landmarks associated with certain (main) bones of the human skeleton, in particular the spine. We also investigate different approaches to positioning of these landmarks employing CT datasets with annotated internal landmarks as training data. The general pipeline of our proposed method comprises the following steps: First, we train an active shape model using an existing avatar database and segmented CT surfaces. This stage also includes a gravity correction procedure, which accounts for shape changes due to the fact that the avatar models were obtained in standing position, while the CT data were acquired with patients in supine position. Second, we match the gravity-corrected avatar patient surface models to surfaces segmented from the CT datasets. In the last step, we derive the spatial relationships between the patient surface model and internal anatomical landmarks.ResultWe trained and evaluated our method using cross-validation using 20 datasets, each containing 50 internal landmarks. We further compared the performance of four different generalized linear modelsâ€™ setups to describe the positioning of the internal landmarks relative to the patient surface. The best mean estimation error over all the landmarks was achieved using lasso regression with a mean error of $$12.19 \pm 6.98\ \hbox {mm}$$12.19Â±6.98mm.ConclusionConsidering that interventional X-ray imaging systems can have detectors covering an area of about $$200\ \hbox {mm} \times 266\ \hbox {mm}$$200mmÃ—266mm ($$20\ \hbox {cm} \times 27\ \hbox {cm}$$20cmÃ—27cm) at iso-center, this accuracy is sufficient to facilitate automatic positioning of the X-ray system.",2018,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery
Adaptive Class Preserving Representation for Image Classification,"In linear representation-based image classification, an unlabeled sample is represented by the entire training set. To obtain a stable and discriminative solution, regularization on the vector of representation coefficients is necessary. For example, the representation in sparse representation-based classification (SRC) uses L1 norm penalty as regularization, which is equal to lasso. However, lasso overemphasizes the role of sparseness while ignoring the inherent structure among samples belonging to a same class. Many recent developed representation classifications have adopted lasso-type regressions to improve the performance. In this paper, we propose the adaptive class preserving representation for classification (ACPRC). Our method is related to group lasso based classification but different in two key points: When training samples in a class are uncorrelated, ACPRC turns into SRC, when samples in a class are highly correlated, it obtains similar result as group lasso. The superiority of ACPRC over other state-of-the-art regularization techniques including lasso, group lasso, sparse group lasso, etc. are evaluated by extensive experiments.",2017,2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
Identifying correlations between LIGO's astronomical range and auxiliary sensors using lasso regression,"The range to which the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) can observe astrophysical systems varies over time, limited by noise in the instruments and their environments. Identifying and removing the sources of noise that limit LIGO's range enables higher signal-to-noise observations and increases the number of observations. The LIGO observatories are continuously monitored by hundreds of thousands of auxiliary channels that may contain information about these noise sources. This paper describes an algorithm that uses linear regression, namely lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression, to analyze all of these channels and identify a small subset of them that can be used to reconstruct variations in LIGO's astrophysical range. Exemplary results of the application of this method to three different periods of LIGO Livingston data are presented, along with computational performance and current limitations.",2018,Classical and Quantum Gravity
Channel Pruning for Accelerating Very Deep Neural Networks,"In this paper, we introduce a new channel pruning method to accelerate very deep convolutional neural networks. Given a trained CNN model, we propose an iterative two-step algorithm to effectively prune each layer, by a LASSO regression based channel selection and least square reconstruction. We further generalize this algorithm to multi-layer and multi-branch cases. Our method reduces the accumulated error and enhance the compatibility with various architectures. Our pruned VGG-16 achieves the state-of-the-art results by 5Ã— speed-up along with only 0.3% increase of error. More importantly, our method is able to accelerate modern networks like ResNet, Xception and suffers only 1.4%, 1.0% accuracy loss under 2Ã— speedup respectively, which is significant.",2017,2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)

Computationally efficient change point detection for high-dimensional regression,"Large-scale sequential data is often exposed to some degree of inhomogeneity in the form of sudden changes in the parameters of the data-generating process. We consider the problem of detecting such structural changes in a high-dimensional regression setting. We propose a joint estimator of the number and the locations of the change points and of the parameters in the corresponding segments. The estimator can be computed using dynamic programming or, as we emphasize here, it can be approximated using a binary search algorithm with $O(n \log(n) \mathrm{Lasso}(n))$ computational operations while still enjoying essentially the same theoretical properties; here $\mathrm{Lasso}(n)$ denotes the computational cost of computing the Lasso for sample size $n$. We establish oracle inequalities for the estimator as well as for its binary search approximation, covering also the case with a large (asymptotically growing) number of change points. We evaluate the performance of the proposed estimation algorithms on simulated data and apply the methodology to real data.",2016,arXiv: Methodology
National Veterans Health Administration inpatient risk stratification models for hospital-acquired acute kidney injury,"OBJECTIVE
Hospital-acquired acute kidney injury (HA-AKI) is a potentially preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Identifying high-risk patients prior to the onset of kidney injury is a key step towards AKI prevention.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A national retrospective cohort of 1,620,898 patient hospitalizations from 116 Veterans Affairs hospitals was assembled from electronic health record (EHR) data collected from 2003 to 2012. HA-AKI was defined at stage 1+, stage 2+, and dialysis. EHR-based predictors were identified through logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression, and random forests, and pair-wise comparisons between each were made. Calibration and discrimination metrics were calculated using 50 bootstrap iterations. In the final models, we report odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and importance rankings for predictor variables to evaluate their significance.


RESULTS
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the different model outcomes ranged from 0.746 to 0.758 in stage 1+, 0.714 to 0.720 in stage 2+, and 0.823 to 0.825 in dialysis. Logistic regression had the best AUC in stage 1+ and dialysis. Random forests had the best AUC in stage 2+ but the least favorable calibration plots. Multiple risk factors were significant in our models, including some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, blood pressure medications, antibiotics, and intravenous fluids given during the first 48â€‰h of admission.


CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated that, although all the models tested had good discrimination, performance characteristics varied between methods, and the random forests models did not calibrate as well as the lasso or logistic regression models. In addition, novel modifiable risk factors were explored and found to be significant.",2015,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA

1 2 O ct 2 01 9 First order expansion of convex regularized estimators,"We consider first order expansions of convex penalized estimators in highdimensional regression problems with random designs. Our setting includes linear regression and logistic regression as special cases. For a given penalty function h and the corresponding penalized estimator Î²Ì‚, we construct a quantity Î·, the first order expansion of Î²Ì‚, such that the distance between Î²Ì‚ and Î· is an order of magnitude smaller than the estimation error â€–Î²Ì‚ âˆ’ Î²âˆ—â€–. In this sense, the first order expansion Î· can be thought of as a generalization of influence functions from the mathematical statistics literature to regularized estimators in high-dimensions. Such first order expansion implies that the risk of Î²Ì‚ is asymptotically the same as the risk of Î· which leads to a precise characterization of the MSE of Î²Ì‚; this characterization takes a particularly simple form for isotropic design. Such first order expansion also leads to inference results based on Î²Ì‚. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of such first order expansion for three regularizers: the Lasso in its constrained form, the lasso in its penalized form, and the Group-Lasso. The results apply to general loss functions under some conditions and those conditions are satisfied for the squared loss in linear regression and for the logistic loss in the logistic model. Introduction. We consider learning problems where one observes observations (X1, Y1), ..., (Xn, Yn) with responses Yi and feature vectors Xi âˆˆ R. The literature of the past two decades has demonstrated the great success of regularized estimators that are commonly defined as solutions to regularized optimization problems of the form Î²Ì‚ = argminÎ²âˆˆRp n âˆ’1 âˆ‘n i=1 l(Yi, X T i Î²) + h(Î²), (1) where l(Â·, Â·) is referred to as the loss (e.g. squared loss, logistic loss) and h : R â†’ R is a regularization penalty (e.g. the l1-norm for the Lasso, the l2,1 norm for the Group-Lasso). All tuning parameters are included in h(Â·). The performance of such regularized estimators is measured in terms of prediction error or in terms estimation error â€–Î²Ì‚ âˆ’ Î²âˆ—â€– if the data comes from a model such as Y = XÎ² + Îµ for some noise random variable Îµ in linear regression or P(Y = 1|X = x) = 1/(1 + exp(xÎ²)) = 1âˆ’ P(Y = 0|X = x) in logistic regression, where Î² is the unknown coefficient vector. For instance, if s = â€–Î²â€–0 is the sparsity of Î² in the above model, and (Xi, Yi)i=1,...,n are iid observations with the same distribution as (X,Y ), both the Lasso in linear regression and the logistic Lasso in logistic regression enjoy rate optimality: â€–Î²Ì‚ âˆ’ Î²âˆ—â€–2 â‰¤ s log(ep/s)/n; see [35, 1] or the proof of Proposition 3.4 in Appendix F for self-contained proofs. The latter estimation bound is optimal in a minimax sense and cannot 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada. be improved, and the minimax rate s log(ep/s)/n represents the scale below which uncertainty is unavoidable by information theoretic arguments, see for instance [36, Section 5]. We are interested in providing first order expansion of Î²Ì‚ at scales negligible compared to the minimax estimation rate, e.g. at scales negligible compared to s log(ep/s)/n in the aforementioned sparsity contexts. To be more precise, the results below will construct random first order expansion Î· such that Î· is measurable w.r.t. a much smaller sigma algebra than that generated by (Xi, Yi)i=1,...,n, and â€–Î· âˆ’ Î²Ì‚â€–K = op(1)â€–Î²Ì‚ âˆ’ Î²â€–K for some norm â€– Â· â€–K related to the problem at hand, (2) where op(1) is a quantity that converges to 0 in probability. In other words, we provide a firstorder expansion of Î²Ì‚ similar to an influence function expansion, cf. Section 1. This allows for understanding bias and standard deviation of Î²Ì‚ at a finer scale than simply showing that Î²Ì‚ âˆ’ Î² converge to zero at the minimax rate. The present paper intends to answer the two questions below regarding such first order expansion. (Q1) How to construct Î· such that (2) holds for a given convex regularized estimator such as (1)? (Q2) How are such first order expansions useful in high-dimensional learning problems where convex regularized estimators (1) are commonly used? An expansion Î· satisfying (2) is interesting in and by itself because it describes phenomena at a finer scale than most of the literature in high-dimensional problems which focuses on minimax prediction and estimation bounds. More importantly, we will see in Section 4 that such first-order expansions lead to exact identities for the loss of estimators, and in Section 5 that such first-order expansions can be used for inference (i.e., uncertainty quantification) about the unknown coefficient vector Î².

Identification of m6A-related genes and m6A RNA methylation regulators in pancreatic cancer and their association with survival.,"Background
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification holds an important position in tumorigenesis and metastasis because it can change gene expression and even function in multiple levels including RNA splicing, stability, translocation and translation. In present study, we aim to conducted comprehensive investigation on m6A RNA methylation regulators and m6A-related genes in pancreatic cancer and their association with survival time.


Methods
Based on Univariate Cox regression analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, LASSO Cox regression, a risk prognostic model, STRING, Spearman and consensus clustering analysis, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database was used to analyze 15 m6A RNA methylation regulators that were widely reported and 1,393 m6A-related genes in m6Avar.


Results
We found that 283 candidate m6A RNA methylation-related genes and 4 m6A RNA methylation regulatory factors, including RNA binding motif protein 15 (RBM15), methyltransferase like 14 (METTL14), fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), and Î±-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), differed significantly among different stages of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Protein-protein interaction analysis indicated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), plectin-1 (PLEC), BLM RecQ like helicase (BLM), and polo like kinase 1 (PLK1) were closely related to other genes and could be considered as hub genes in the network. The results of LASSO Cox regression and the risk prognostic model indicated that AJCC stage, stage T and N, KRAS mutation status and x8q23.3 CNV fragment mutation differed significantly between the high-risk and the low-risk subgroups. The AUCs of 1 to 5 years after surgery were all more than 0.7 and increased year by year. Finally, we found KRAS mutation status and AJCC stage differed significantly among these groups after TCGA samples divided into subgroups with k=7. Moreover, we identified four m6A RNA methylation related genes expressed significantly differently among these seven subgroups, including collagen type VII alpha 1 chain (COL7A1), branched chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1), zinc finger protein 596 (ZNF596), and PLK1.


Conclusions
Our study systematically analyzed the m6A RNA methylation related genes, including expression, protein-protein interaction, potential function, and prognostic value and provides important clues to further research on the function of RNA m6A methylation and its related genes in pancreatic cancer.",2020,Annals of translational medicine
Short-Term Forecasting with Mixed-Frequency Data: A MIDASSO Approach,"In this paper we extend the targeted-regressor approach suggested in Bai and Ng (2008) for variables sampled at the same frequency to mixed-frequency data. Our MIDASSO approach is a combination of the unrestricted MIxed-frequency DAta-Sampling approach (U-MIDAS) (see Foroni et al., 2015; Castle et al., 2009; Bec and Mogliani, 2013), and the LASSO-type penalised regression used in Bai and Ng (2008), called the elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005). We illustrate our approach by forecasting the quarterly real GDP growth rate in Switzerland.",2017,Applied Economics
A signature of tumor immune microenvironment genes associated with the prognosis of nonâ€‘small cell lung cancer.,"Establishing a prognostic genetic signature closely related to the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) to predict clinical outcomes is necessary. Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database of a nonâ€‘small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort and the immune score derived from the Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in Malignant Tumours using Expression data (ESTIMATE) algorithm, we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model to screen a 10â€‘gene signature among the 448 differentially expressed genes and found that the risk prediction models constructed by 10 genes could be more sensitive to prognosis than TNM (Tumor, Lymph node and Metastasis) stage (P=0.006). The CIBERSORT method was applied to quantify the relative levels of different immune cell types. It was found that the ratio of eosinophils, mast cells (MCs) resting and CD4 T cells memory activated in the lowâ€‘risk group was higher than that in the highâ€‘risk group, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.003, P=0.014 and P=0.018, respectively). Inconsistently, the ratio of resting natural killer (NK) cells and activated plasma cells in the lowâ€‘risk group was significantly lower than that in the highâ€‘risk group (P=0.05 and P=0.009, respectively). Kaplanâ€‘Meier survival results showed that patients of the highâ€‘risk group had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than those of the lowâ€‘risk group in the training set (P<0.001). Furthermore, Kaplanâ€‘Meier survival showed that patients of the highâ€‘risk group had significantly shorter OS than those of the lowâ€‘risk group (P=0.0025 and P=0.0157, respectively) in the validation set [GSE31210 and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)]. The 10â€‘gene signature was found to be an independent risk factor for prognosis in univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses (P<0.001). In addition, it was found that the risk model constructed by the 10â€‘gene signature was related to the clinical related factors in logistic regression analysis. The genetic signature closely related to the immune microenvironment was found to be able to predict differences in the proportion of immune cells (eosinophils, resting MCs, memory activated CD4 T cells, resting NK cells and plasma cells) in the risk model. Our findings suggest that the genetic signature closely related to TIME could predict the prognosis of NSCLC patients, and provide some reference for immunotherapy.",2020,Oncology reports
Approximating UAV and Vision Feature Point Correlations in a Simplified SLAM problem,"Navigation with a range sensor and vision aided inertial measurement unit (IMU) estimation is difficult in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments. Ignoring vision feature point and vehicle state correlations contributes to inaccuracy and filter inconsistency. Approximation of feature point and vehicle cross correlation terms would allow the accuracy and consistency comparable to a correlated solution whilst reducing operation count and allowing for decoupled filter design. A Monte-Carlo simulation for a two dimensional bearing to feature point approximation of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem was developed. The results of a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were then used to estimate cross covariance terms. A 1000 trial simulation showed that the regression solution was comparable in accuracy and consistency to the fully correlated solution. Future developments have the potential to provide a more accurate, approximately correlated SLAM solution to bound IMU drift for UAVs operating in a GPS denied environment.",2019,2019 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)
