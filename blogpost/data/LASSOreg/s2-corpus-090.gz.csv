Gene regulatory network inference using fused LASSO on multiple data sets,"Devising computational methods to accurately reconstruct gene regulatory networks given gene expression data is key to systems biology applications. Here we propose a method for reconstructing gene regulatory networks by simultaneous consideration of data sets from different perturbation experiments and corresponding controls. The method imposes three biologically meaningful constraints: (1) expression levels of each gene should be explained by the expression levels of a small number of transcription factor coding genes, (2) networks inferred from different data sets should be similar with respect to the type and number of regulatory interactions, and (3) relationships between genes which exhibit similar differential behavior over the considered perturbations should be favored. We demonstrate that these constraints can be transformed in a fused LASSO formulation for the proposed method. The comparative analysis on transcriptomics time-series data from prokaryotic species, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as a eukaryotic species, mouse, demonstrated that the proposed method has the advantages of the most recent approaches for regulatory network inference, while obtaining better performance and assigning higher scores to the true regulatory links. The study indicates that the combination of sparse regression techniques with other biologically meaningful constraints is a promising framework for gene regulatory network reconstructions.",2016,Scientific Reports
Swapping Variables for High-Dimensional Sparse Regression from Correlated Measurements,"We consider the high-dimensional sparse linear regression problem of accurately estimating a sparse vector using a small number of linear measurements that are contaminated by noise. It is well known that the standard cadre of computationally tractable sparse regression algorithms---such as the Lasso, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and their extensions---perform poorly when the measurement matrix contains highly correlated columns. To address this shortcoming, we develop a simple greedy algorithm, called SWAP, that iteratively swaps variables until convergence. SWAP is surprisingly effective in handling measurement matrices with high correlations. In fact, we prove that SWAP outputs the true support, the locations of the non-zero entries in the sparse vector, under a relatively mild condition on the measurement matrix. Furthermore, we show that SWAP can be used to boost the performance of any sparse regression algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of SWAP by comparing it with several state-of-the-art sparse regression algorithms.",2013,ArXiv
Tomografia computerizzata e risonanza magnetica nella patologia del distretto testa collo,"Scopo del lavoro Ã¨ quello di delineare le indicazioni generali alla radioterapia, definitiva o in associazione alla chirurgia, nei pazienti affetti da carcinoma del distretto testa-collo, anche sulla base delle informazioni TC ed RM, e di descrivere le alterazioni morfologiche radiologiche che emergono, differenziando quelle suggestive di persistenza o recidiva neoplastica, da quelle indotte dalla radioterapia. Sono stati selezionati 95 pazienti che hanno praticato radioterapia come unico trattamento o in associazione alla chirurgia. Il primo controllo radiologico Ã¨ stato effettuato di norma in un periodo di tempo compreso tra i 3 e i 4, 5 mesi dal termine della radioterapia. I pazienti sono stati seguiti nel tempo con esami seriati rispettivamente a 6, 9 e 12 mesi a distanza dal termine della radioterapia, a seconda dei rilievi emersi al primo controllo a ciclo terapeutico ultimato. Per quanto concerne la valutazione della risposta del tumore primitivo alla radioterapia sono stati distinti tre gruppi di pazienti. Il primo gruppo comprende soggetti nei quali il tumore primitivo, valutato alla TC e/o RM prima del trattamento radioterapico, ha dimostrato una regressione volumetrica superiore al 75% nei controlli tra i 3 ed i 12 mesi dalla fine del ciclo terapeutico (31 pazienti). Il secondo gruppo comprende soggetti nei quali il volume tissutale residuo dopo radioterapia, nei controlli a tre mesi, ha dimostrato una regressione inferiore al 50%, una persistenza o addirittura una progressione (44 pazienti). Un terzo gruppo Ã¨ costituito da soggetti nei quali la regressione volumetrica del tessuto neoplastico nel controllo a tre mesi dal termine del ciclo terapeutico radioterapico Ã¨ compresa tra il 50 ed il 75%. Quest'ultimo gruppo Ã¨ quello che pone i maggiori problemi diagnostici e che viene seguito con controlli seriati ogni tre mesi, anche in presenza di negativitÃ  degli esami clinici ed endoscopici (20 pazienti). Le alterazioni tissutali post-radioterapiche sono state distinte in transitorie e permanenti. Quelle transitorie hanno raggiunto il massimo della loro espressivitÃ  al termine del ciclo di trattamento, con visualizzazione di una massa conglomerata piÃ¹ estesa del tumore primitivo. Quelle permanenti si sono verificate a carico dei tessuti superficiali (ispessimenti della cute e del platisma, addensamenti nel tessuto adiposo sottocutaneo), nei piani fasciali profondi periviscerali (fibrosi del connettivo lasso adiposo parafaringeo, cervicale anteriore e posteriore, pericarotideo), nelle logge salivari (scialoadenite reattiva e degenerazione grassa), a livello degli spazi mucosi profondi (ispessimento simmetrico e infiltrazione delle pliche ariepiglottiche e delle corde vocali false, obliterazione dei piani adiposi pre- e paraglottici). La difficoltÃ  di interpretazione delle immagini, con particolare riguardo ai possibili falsi positivi e falsi negativi, rappresenta soltanto una delle diverse facce della complessa problematica in corso di carcinoma del distretto testa-collo. Infatti i quesiti da risolvere coinvolgono anche il clinico, il chirurgo, il radioterapista oltre che il radiologo, il cui sforzo comune deve essere quello di garantire al paziente la migliore terapia possibile a fronte di una qualitÃ  di vita accettabile.",1996,The Neuroradiology Journal
"Statistical inference for structural models in high dimension. Sparse generalized linear models, PLS through orthogonal polynomials and community detection in graphs","This thesis falls within the context of high-dimensional data analysis. Nowadays we have access to an increasing amount of information. The major challenge relies on our ability to explore a huge amount of data and to infer their dependency structures.The purpose of this thesis is to study and provide theoretical guarantees to some specific methods that aim at estimating dependency structures for high-dimensional data. The first part of the thesis is devoted to the study of sparse models through Lasso-type methods. In Chapter 1, we present the main results on this topic and then we generalize the Gaussian case to any distribution from the exponential family. The major contribution to this field is presented in Chapter 2 and consists in oracle inequalities for a Group Lasso procedure applied to generalized linear models. These results show that this estimator achieves good performances under some specific conditions on the model. We illustrate this part by considering the case of the Poisson model. The second part concerns linear regression in high dimension but the sparsity assumptions is replaced by a low dimensional structure underlying the data. We focus in particular on the PLS method that attempts to find an optimal decomposition of the predictors given a response. We recall the main idea in Chapter 3. The major contribution to this part consists in a new explicit analytical expression of the dependency structure that links the predictors to the response. The next two chapters illustrate the power of this formula by emphasising new theoretical results for PLS. The third and last part is dedicated to graphs modelling and especially to community detection. After presenting the main trends on this topic, we draw our attention to Spectral Clustering that allows to cluster nodes of a graph with respect to a similarity matrix. In this thesis, we suggest an alternative to this method by considering a $l_1$ penalty. We illustrate this method through simulations.",2015,
Adaptive lasso penalised censored composite quantile regression,"To account for censoring in estimating the accelerated failure time AFT model with right censored data, the weighted least squares regression WLSR has been developed by using the inverse-censoring-probability weights. However, it is well known that the traditional ordinary least squares may fail to produce a reliable estimator for data subject to heavy-tailed errors or outliers. For robust estimation in the AFT model, we propose the weighted composite quantile regression WCQR method, in which the sum of weighted multiple quantile objective functions based on the inverse-censoring-probability weights is used as a loss function. As a novel regularisation method for right censored data, we further propose the adaptive lasso penalised WCQR AWCQR method in order to perform simultaneous estimation and variable selection. The large sample properties of the WCQR and AWCQR estimators are established under some regularity conditions. The proposed methods are evaluated through simulation studies and real data applications.",2016,IJDMB
Development of a long non-coding RNA signature for prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma,"Standard treatment for locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma (LARC) includes a combination of chemotherapy with pyrimidine analogues, such as capecitabine, and radiation therapy, followed by surgery. Currently no clinically useful genomic predictors of benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) exist for LARC. In this study we assessed the expression of 8,127 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), poorly studied in LARC, to infer their ability in classifying patients' pathological complete response (pCR). We collected and analyzed, using lncRNA-specific Agilent microarrays a consecutive series of 61 LARC cases undergoing nCRT. Potential lncRNA predictors in responders and non-responders to nCRT were identified with LASSO regression, and a model was optimized using k-fold cross-validation after selection of the three most informative lncRNA. 11 lncRNAs were differentially expressed with false discovery rate < 0.01 between responders and non-responders to NACT. We identified lnc-KLF7-1, lnc-MAB21L2-1, and LINC00324 as the most promising variable subset for classification building. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 0.91 and 0.94 respectively, with an AUC of our ROC curve = 0.93. Our study shows for the first time that lncRNAs can accurately predict response in LARC undergoing nCRT. Our three-lncRNA based signature must be independently validated and further analyses must be conducted to fully understand the biological role of the identified signature, but our results suggest lncRNAs may be an ideal biomarker for response prediction in the studied setting.",2020,PLoS ONE
Identification of a three-miRNA signature as a novel potential prognostic biomarker in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,"Current studies suggest that some microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In this paper, we aimed to identify a miRNAs signature to improve prognostic prediction for ccRCC patients. Using ccRCC RNA-Seq data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we identified 177 differentially expressed miRNAs between ccRCC and paracancerous tissue. Then all the ccRCC tumor samples were divided into training set and validation set randomly. Three-miRNA signature including miR130b, miR-18a, and miR-223 were constructed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model in training set. According to optimal cut-off value of three-miRNA signature risk score, all the patients could be classified into high-risk group and low-risk group significantly. Survival of patients was significantly different between two groups (hazard ratio, 5.58, 95% confidence interval, 3.17-9.80; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), and three-miRNA signature performed favorably prognostic and predictive accuracy. The results were further validated in the validation set and total set. Multivariate Cox regression analyses and subgroup analyses showed that three-miRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor. Two nomograms that integrated three-miRNA signature and three clinicopathological risk factors were constructed to predict overall survival and disease-free survival after surgery for ccRCC patients. Functional enrichment analysis showed the possible roles of three-miRNA signature in some cancer-associated biological processes and pathways. In conclusion, we developed a novel three-miRNA signature that performed reliable prognostic for patient survival with ccRCC, it might facilitate ccRCC patients counseling and individualize management.",2019,Journal of cellular biochemistry
Prognostic Value of a Stemness Index-Associated Signature in Primary Lower-Grade Glioma,"Objective As a prevalent and infiltrative cancer type of the central nervous system, the prognosis of lower-grade glioma (LGG) in adults is highly heterogeneous. Recent evidence has demonstrated the prognostic value of the mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) in LGG. Our aim was to develop a stemness index-based signature (SI-signature) for risk stratification and survival prediction. Methods Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LGG in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and normal brain tissue samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project were screened out, and the weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to identify the mRNAsi-related gene sets. Meanwhile, the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed for the functional annotation of the key genes. ESTIMATE was used to calculate tumor purity for acquiring the correct mRNAsi. Differences in overall survival (OS) between the high and low mRNAsi (corrected mRNAsi) groups were compared using the Kaplan Meier analysis. By combining the Lasso regression with univariate and multivariate Cox regression, the SI-signature was constructed and validated using the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). Results There was a significant difference in OS between the high and low mRNAsi groups, which was also observed in the two corrected mRNAsi groups. Based on threshold limits, 86 DEGs were most significantly associated with mRNAsi via WGCNA. Seven genes (ADAP2, ALOX5AP, APOBEC3C, FCGRT, GNG5, LRRC25, and SP100) were selected to establish a risk signature for primary LGG. The ROC curves showed a fair performance in survival prediction in both the TCGA and the CGGA validation cohorts. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression revealed that the risk group was an independent prognostic factor in primary LGG. The nomogram was developed based on clinical parameters integrated with the risk signature, and its accuracy for predicting 3- and 5-years survival was assessed by the concordance index, the area under the curve of the time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve, and calibration curves. Conclusion The SI-signature with seven genes could serve as an independent predictor, and suggests the importance of stemness features in risk stratification and survival prediction in primary LGG.",2020,
Variable Selection via Regression Trees in the Presence of Irrelevant Variables,"Many tree algorithms have been developed for regression problems. Although they are regarded as good algorithms, most of them suffer from loss of prediction accuracy when there are many irrelevant variables and the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations. We propose the multistep regression tree with adaptive variable selection to handle this problem. The variable selection step and the fitting step comprise the multistep method. The multistep generalized unbiased interaction detection and estimation (GUIDE) with adaptive forward selection (fg) algorithm, as a variable selection tool, performs better than some of the well-known variable selection algorithms such as efficacy adaptive regression tube hunting (EARTH), FSR (false selection rate), LSCV (least squares cross-validation), and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for the regression problem. The results based on simulation study show that fg outperforms other algorithms in terms of selection result and computation time. It generally selects the important variables correctly with relatively few irrelevant variables, which gives good prediction accuracy with less computation time.",2013,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
Income Diversification and Bank Stability: Evidence from India,"Modern portfolio theory claims that diversification into non-correlated or negatively correlated activities reduces the overall risk of a portfolio. Considering the total income of a bank as a portfolio of interest income and non-interest income, this paper investigates how the variability of interest income and noninterest income, and covariance between interest income and noninterest income influence the various risk factors of banks. We set out a study in the Indian context. We have extracted data for the period 2005-2017 and employed an extended version of Ridge, Lasso and Elastics Net regression to take care of multi-collinearly in our data. We have considered 10-fold cross-validation techniques to get optimal values of tuning parameters for Ridge, Lasso, and Elastics Net regression (which is a convex combination of ridge and the LASSO). We have compared different regression techniques by comparing RMSE and R. We observe that noninterest income is positively correlated with interest income in the Indian context, but it does stabilize variance, idiosyncratic risk & market risk (Beta) of Indian Banks.",2018,
Locality Preserving Projection With Sparse Penalty,"LASSO is a hybrid theoretic learning framework combining both l_1 norm and l_2 norm.In this paper,a novel sparse learning algorithm,called locality preserving projection with sparse penalty(SpLPP),is presented with its regularized version,which two methods perform locality preserving projection in the LASSO regression framework.The proposed model can be solved in regression framework with Cholesky decomposition,and its convergence is guaranteed in theory,together with its complexity.The proposed algorithms merge feature selection and dimensionality reduction into one analysis,which indicates that the proposed algorithms can be performed in either supervised or unsupervised tasks.Experiments on synthetic and real database show that the algorithms in this paper are competitive compared with the state of the art methods.",2014,Chinese Journal of Computers
Microbial Diversity of Genital Ulcers of HSV-2 Seropositive Women,"We measured the microbial community structure of genital ulcers in women. Swabs from clinically detected ulcers were tested for HSV-2 and Treponema pallidum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HSV-2 and T. pallidum were detected by serum antibody testing. Microbial community structure was characterized by high-throughput 16â€‰s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Multiple group testing and Elastic net and Lasso regressions identified taxa associated with differences in factors of interest. Among 49 ulcer specimens from 49 HSV-2 seropositive women, by PCR HSV-2 was recovered from 28 (57%) specimens and T. pallidum from none; one woman showed serologic evidence of syphilis. Overall, 63% of women were HIV-positive and 49% had an uncircumcised male sex partner. By both multiple group testing and regression, Porphyromonas (FDR p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.02), Prevotella (FDR p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.03), Anaerococcus (FDR p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.07), and Dialister (FDR p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.09) were detected at higher relative abundance in HSV-2 PCR-positive than negative ulcers. The presence of HSV-2 in a lesion was associated with presumed bacterial agents of Bacterial vaginosis. Differences in bacterial communities may contribute to HSV-2 ulcer pathogenesis, severity, or prolonged healing. If these results are confirmed, future studies may consider the influence of BV treatment on womenâ€™s GUD and HSV-2 incidence and recurrence.",2017,Scientific Reports
"Attitude of pregnant women towards HIV testing in Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. DITRAME Study Group (ANRS 049 Clinical Trial). Diminution de la Transmission MÃ¨re Enfant du VIH. Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA.","OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the attitude of pregnant women towards HIV testing in two cities of West Africa: Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.


METHODS
In the context of a clinical trial to prevent HIV vertical transmission, HIV counselling and testing was offered systematically to women attending antenatal clinics. Informed consent was obtained and test results were given anonymously. Multiple logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with refusal for testing and failure to return for test results.


RESULTS
A total of 9724 pregnant women were interviewed from January 1995 to September 1996. In Abidjan (n=5766) and Bobo-Dioulasso (n=3958), 78 and 92.4% of the women consented to HIV testing, respectively, and 58.4 and 81.8% of them returned for the test results disclosure, respectively. In the two sites, the counsellors themselves and high educational level of the women appeared to be related to refusal of the test, whereas last trimester gestation was associated with failure to return for test results. In Abidjan, foreigners and employees were more likely to refuse testing, and HIV-infected women were three times less likely to return for results than uninfected women.


CONCLUSION
Future implementation of interventions to reduce vertical transmission of HIV that require antenatal HIV testing and counselling will have to solve issue of acceptability of HIV testing by pregnant women.",1998,AIDS
"Modeling Areal Measures of Campsite Impacts on the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, USA Using Airborne LiDAR and Field Collected Data","Recent research has emphasized the need to professionally manage campsites for long-term use, particularly in light of rising visitation to natural protected areas worldwide. Camping regulations vary considerably along the length of any long-distance trail due to the many land types and management agencies involved. Large proportions of long-distance trails have at-large camping policies, resulting in camping problems associated with visitor-chosen or developed campsites. Several long-term monitoring studies in areas with at-large camping policies indicate the expansion and proliferation of individual campsites, and growth of overall camping related impacts, to be a substantial managerial concern. This research evaluates the relative influence of environmental and topographic factors, both collected in the field and modeled in GIS using highresolution topography (LiDAR) data, on areal measures of campsite impact utilizing Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized regression for factor selection and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for regressions. Chosen variables in regressions explained 64% of the variation in campsite size and 61% of the variation in the area of vegetation loss on a campsite. Results indicate four variables managers can utilize to enhance the sustainability of campsites: use level, overnight site type, and terrain characteristics relating to slope and topographic roughness. Results support indirect management methods that rely on the design and location of campsites and trails and not the effectiveness of enforcement or restricting visitor freedom. In the face of rising use, techniques and concepts presented aid in identifying or creating ecologically sustainable campsites.

Variable selection in omics data: A practical evaluation of small sample sizes,"In omics experiments, variable selection involves a large number of metabolites/ genes and a small number of samples (the n < p problem). The ultimate goal is often the identification of one, or a few features that are different among conditions- a biomarker. Complicating biomarker identification, the p variables often contain a correlation structure due to the biology of the experiment making identifying causal compounds from correlated compounds difficult. Additionally, there may be elements in the experimental design (blocks, batches) that introduce structure in the data. While this problem has been discussed in the literature and various strategies proposed, the over fitting problems concomitant with such approaches are rarely acknowledged. Instead of viewing a single omics experiment as a definitive test for a biomarker, an unrealistic analytical goal, we propose to view such studies as screening studies where the goal of the study is to reduce the number of features present in the second round of testing, and to limit the Type II error. Using this perspective, the performance of LASSO, ridge regression and Elastic Net was compared with the performance of an ANOVA via a simulation study and two real data comparisons. Interestingly, a dramatic increase in the number of features had no effect on Type I error for the ANOVA approach. ANOVA, even without multiple test correction, has a low false positive rates in the scenarios tested. The Elastic Net has an inflated Type I error (from 10 to 50%) for small numbers of features which increases with sample size. The Type II error rate for the ANOVA is comparable or lower than that for the Elastic Net leading us to conclude that an ANOVA is an effective analytical tool for the initial screening of features in omics experiments.",2018,PLoS ONE
Improved Intact Soil-Core Carbon Determination Applying Regression Shrinkage and Variable Selection Techniques to Complete Spectrum Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS),"Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) provides a potential method for rapid, in situ soil C measurement. In previous research on the application of LIBS to intact soil cores, we hypothesized that ultraviolet (UV) spectrum LIBS (200â€“300 nm) might not provide sufficient elemental information to reliably discriminate between soil organic C (SOC) and inorganic C (IC). In this study, using a custom complete spectrum (245â€“925 nm) core-scanning LIBS instrument, we analyzed 60 intact soil cores from six wheat fields. Predictive multi-response partial least squares (PLS2) models using full and reduced spectrum LIBS were compared for directly determining soil total C (TC), IC, and SOC. Two regression shrinkage and variable selection approaches, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and sparse multivariate regression with covariance estimation (MRCE), were tested for soil C predictions and the identification of wavelengths important for soil C prediction. Using complete spectrum LIBS for PLS2 modeling reduced the calibration standard error of prediction (SEP) 15 and 19% for TC and IC, respectively, compared to UV spectrum LIBS. The LASSO and MRCE approaches provided significantly improved calibration accuracy and reduced SEP 32â€“55% over UV spectrum PLS2 models. We conclude that (1) complete spectrum LIBS is superior to UV spectrum LIBS for predicting soil C for intact soil cores without pretreatment; (2) LASSO and MRCE approaches provide improved calibration prediction accuracy over PLS2 but require additional testing with increased soil and target analyte diversity; and (3) measurement errors associated with analyzing intact cores (e.g., sample density and surface roughness) require further study and quantification.",2013,Applied Spectroscopy
SIVREG: Stata module to perform adaptive Lasso with some invalid instruments,"sivreg estimates a linear instrumental variables regression where some of the instruments fail the exclusion restriction and are thus invalid.

Variable selection for high-dimensional genomic data with censored outcomes using group lasso prior,"The variable selection problem is discussed in the context of high-dimensional failure time data arising from the accelerated failure time model. A data augmentation approach is employed in order to deal with censored survival times and to facilitate prior-posterior conjugacy. To identify a set of grouped relevant covariates, a shrinkage prior distribution is specified for regression coefficients mimicking the effect of group lasso penalty. It is noted that unlike the corresponding frequentist method, a Bayesian penalized regression approach cannot shrink the estimates of coefficients to exact zeros in general. Towards resolving the issue, a two-stage thresholding method that exploits the scaled neighborhood criterion and the Bayesian information criterion is devised. Simulation studies are performed to assess the robustness and performance of the proposed method in terms of variable selection accuracy and predictive power. The method is successfully applied to a set of microarray data on the individuals diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In addition, an R package called psbcGroup, which can be downloaded freely from CRAN, is developed for the implementation of the methods.",2017,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
"Variable Selection by Bayesian Adaptive Lasso and Iterative Adaptive Lasso, with Application for Genome-wide Multiple Loci Mapping","Despite many recent methodological developments, variable selection in high dimensional settings where the number of covariates (p) is larger than the sample size (n) remains a difficult problem, especially when the covariates with zero coefficients are correlated with some covariates with nonzero coefficients. One such example is genome-wide multiple loci mapping with dense genetic markers, where the number of covariates (i.e., the number of genetic markers) are often larger than the sample size and nearby markers often share similar genotype profiles due to linkage or linkage disequilibrium. The adaptive Lasso (Zou, H. 2006) is a state-of-the-art method for simultaneous variable selection and estimation in the setting of linear regression. However, it requires consistent initial estimates of the regression coefficients, which are generally not available in the aforementioned high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose two variable selection methods: the Bayesian adaptive Lasso and the iterative adaptive Lasso. These two methods extend the adaptive Lasso in the sense that they do not require any informative initial estimates of the regression coefficients. We systematically evaluate the variable selection performance of the proposed methods as well as several existing methods within the framework of genome-wide multiple loci mapping. We show that the proposed methods have improved variable selection performance compared to most existing methods and the iterative adaptive Lasso also has superior computational efficiency.

Asynchronous Decentralized Successive Convex Approximation.,"We study decentralized asynchronous multiagent optimization over networks, modeled as static (possibly directed) graphs. The optimization problem consists of minimizing a (possibly nonconvex) smooth function--the sum of the agents' local costs--plus a convex (possibly nonsmooth) regularizer, subject to convex constraints. Agents can perform their local computations as well as communicate with their immediate neighbors at any time, without any form of coordination or centralized scheduling; furthermore, when solving their local subproblems, they can use outdated information from their neighbors. We propose the first distributed asynchronous algorithm, termed ASY-DSCA, that converges at an R-linear rate to the optimal solution of convex problems whose objective function satisfies a general error bound condition; this condition is weaker than the more frequently used strong convexity, and it is satisfied by several empirical risk functions that are not strongly convex; examples include LASSO and logistic regression problems. When the objective function is nonconvex, ASY-DSCA converges to a stationary solution of the problem at a sublinear rate.",2019,arXiv: Optimization and Control
A multidimensional shrinkage-thresholding operator,"The scalar shrinkage-thresholding operator (SSTO) is a key ingredient of many modern statistical signal processing algorithms including: sparse inverse problem solutions, wavelet denoising, and JPEG2000 image compression. In these applications, it is customary to select the threshold of the operator by solving a scalar sparsity penalized quadratic optimization. In this work, we present a natural multidimensional extension of the scalar shrinkage thresholding operator. Similarly to the scalar case, the threshold is determined by the minimization of a convex quadratic form plus an euclidean penalty, however, here the optimization is performed over a domain of dimension N â‰¥ 1. The solution to this convex optimization problem is called the multidimensional shrinkage threshold operator (MSTO). The MSTO reduces to the standard SSTO in the special case of N = 1. In the general case of N â‰« 1 the optimal MSTO threshold can be found by a simple convex line search. We present three illustrative applications of the MSTO in the context of non-linear regression: l2-penalized linear regression, Group LASSO linear regression and Group LASSO logistic regression.",2009,2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing

Non-linear association of plasma level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with endobronchial biopsy bleeding in patients with lung cancer,"BackgroundDespite a large body of studies have demonstrated the multifaceted behavior of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) in several physiological and pathological processes, the levels of plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) that may be associated with endobronchial biopsy (EBB)-related bleeding have never been examined.MethodsWe conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of 628 consecutive patients with primary lung cancer who had undergone EBB at a large tertiary hospital between January 2014 and February 2018. Patients were divided into the bleeding group and the non-bleeding group according to the bronchoscopy report. The association between HDL-C levels and EBB-induced bleeding was evaluated using the LASSO regression analysis, multiple regression analysis and smooth curve fitting adjusted for potential confounders.ResultsThere was an inverse association of plasma HDL-C concentration with the incidence of EBB-induced bleeding as assessed by univariate analysis (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). However, in piecewise linear regression analysis, a non-linear relationship with threshold saturation effects was observed between plasma HDL-C concentrations and EBB-induced bleeding. The incidence of EBB-induced bleeding decreased with HDL-C concentrations from 1.5â€‰mmol/L up to 2.0â€‰mmol/L (adjusted OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20â€“0.74), but increased with HDL-C levels above the inflection point (HDL-Câ€‰=â€‰2.0â€‰mmol/L).ConclusionsThere was a non-linear association between plasma HDL-C concentrations and the risk of EBB-induced bleeding in patients with lung cancer. The plasma level of HDL-C above 2.0â€‰mmol/L or below 1.5â€‰mmol/L may increase the risk of EBB-induced bleeding.",2019,Lipids in Health and Disease
