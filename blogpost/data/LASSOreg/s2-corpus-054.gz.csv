Regression Discriminant Analysis (RDA) Variants,"This study is a follow-up to earlier publications on the relationship of least squares regression to FDA. In particular, we focus on the paper; On the Regression Discriminant Analysis (RDA), and its Identical Relationship to the Fisherâ€™s Discriminant Analysis, and argue that since Î²Ì‚ is a vector of coefficients for the least squares regression, given that y âˆˆ (+1,âˆ’1), then a substitution of Î²Ì‚ with either Î²Ì‚ridge or Î²Ì‚lasso gives a regression discriminant analysis variant. We note that both Î²Ì‚ridge and Î²Ì‚lasso are respectively vectors of coefficients for ridge regression and lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), given that y âˆˆ (+1,âˆ’1). We therefore identify Ridge Regression Discriminant Analysis (RRDA) and Lasso Discriminant Analysis (LaDA) as the two regression discriminant analysis variants. Further empirical investigation follows, mainly to show that RRDA and LaDA compete favourably against a known Fisherâ€™s Discriminant Analysis (FDA) variant namely, Regularized Fisherâ€™s Discriminant Analysis (RFDA). Since RRDA, LaDA or RFDA can be used in place of FDA in high dimensions, we further determine the most suitable replacement for FDA assuming we are in high dimensions.",2017,
Genomewide identification of a novel sixâ€LncRNA signature to improve prognosis prediction in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma,"The current prognostic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signatures for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still controversial and need to be optimized by systematic bioinformatics analyses with suitable methods and appropriate patients. Therefore, we performed the study to establish a credible lncRNA signature for HCC outcome prediction and explore the related mechanisms. Based on the lncRNA profile and the clinical data of carefully selected HCC patients (nÂ =Â 164) in TCGA, six of 12727 lncRNAs, MIR22HG, CTC-297N7.9, CTD-2139B15.2, RP11-589N15.2, RP11-343N15.5, and RP11-479G22.8 were identified as the independent predictors of patients' overall survival in HCC by sequential univariate Cox and 1000 times Cox LASSO regression with 10-fold CV, and multivariate Cox analysis with 1000 times bootstrapping. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis with patients trichotomized by the six-lncRNA signature, high-risk patients showed significantly shorter survival than mid- and low-risk patients (log-rank test PÂ <Â 0.0001). According to the ROCs, the six-lncRNA signature showed superior predictive capacity than the two existing four-lncRNA combinations and the traditional prognostic clinicopathological parameter TNM stage. Furthermore, low MIR22HG and CTC-297N7.9, but high CTD-2139B15.2, RP11-589N15.2, RP11-343N15.5, and RP11-479G22.8, were, respectively, demonstrated to be related with the malignant phenotypes of HCC. Functionally, the six lncRNAs were disclosed to involve in the regulation of multiple cell cycle and stress response-related pathways via mediating transcription regulation and chromatin modification. In conclusion, our study identified a novel six-lncRNA signature for resectable HCC prognosis prediction and indicated the underlying mechanisms of HCC progression and the potential functions of the six lncRNAs awaiting further elucidation.",2018,Cancer Medicine
Adaptive LASSO hyperspectral unmixing using ADMM,"In this paper, a method of hyperspectral unmixing for the linear regression model is introduced. The proposed algorithm employs an adaptive lasso problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for unmixing process. Indeed, we formulate a weighted l1 norm problem under the reasonable given error to reconstruct the fractional abundances and to avoid inconsistent end member selection in a sparse semi-supervised hyperspectral imaging process. We show that this problem can be efficiently solved by appropriate selection of functions and parameters appearing in the ADMM approach. First, we enforce both non-negativity and full additivity constraints of the abundance fractions in the objective function. Then, we apply the ADMM algorithm to solve the acquired optimization problem. Our simulations show that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean square error and reconstruction signal-to-noise-ratio with reasonably reduced computational costs.",2014,2014 27th Biennial Symposium on Communications (QBSC)
Thermal load forecasting in district heating networks using deep learning and advanced feature selection methods,"Recent research has seen several forecasting methods being applied for heat load forecasting of district heating networks. This paper presents two methods that gain significant improvements compared to the previous works. First, an automated way of handling non-linear dependencies in linear models is presented. In this context, the paper implements a new method for feature selection based on [1], resulting in computationally efficient models with higher accuracies. The three main models used here are linear, ridge, and lasso regression. In the second approach, a deep learning method is presented. Although computationally more intensive, the deep learning model provides higher accuracy than the linear models with automated feature selection. Finally, we compare and contrast the proposed methods with earlier work for day-ahead forecasting of heat load in two different district heating networks.",2018,Energy
Gut Microbiota Functional Biomolecules With Immune-Lipid Metabolism for a Prognostic Compound Score in Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Gastric Adenocarcinoma: A Pilot Study,"OBJECTIVE
Increasing evidence has indicated an association between gut microbiota in gastrointestinal cancer and clinical outcome. Herein, we aim to develop a prognosis-prediction tool based on an immune-lipid metabolism signature, tumor cell-associated immune microenvironment, and lipid metabolism proteins inferred from the function of gut microbiota.


METHODS
16S gene ribosomal RNA sequencing was performed on 10 fecal samples obtained after tumor resection but before chemotherapy (EBVaGC = 4 and EBVnGC = 6). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was applied to screening for highly accurate marker proteins. A compound score based on the fraction of screened markers was then constructed using a LASSO logistic regression model.


RESULTS
The Tax4Fun analysis based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes data indicated differentially expressed tumor pathway between EBVnGC and EBVaGC. Using the LASSO logistic model, a compound score was established consisting of 14 types of immune microenvironment and lipid metabolism proteins. In the training set (378 patients), significant differences were found between high- and low-compound score groups in overall survival across and within subpopulations with an identical EBV. Multivariable analysis revealed that the compound score was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval = 2.28-3.36). The prognostic value ;of the compound score was also confirmed in the validation (162 patients) and entire (540 patients) sets.


DISCUSSION
The proposed compound score is a promising signature for estimating overall survival in patients with gastric cancer having EBVaGCs or EBVnGCs.",2019,Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology
On the importance of local and global analysis in the judgment of similarity and dissimilarity of faces,"Abstract The ability to recognize faces and to detect differences and similarities between faces has proved to be fundamental in the evolution of humans and in the conditioning of their social behaviors. In this paper, we investigate basic mechanisms underlying this ability, focusing in particular on the relevance of local and global features and on some interesting differences characterizing judgments of similarity with respect to judgments of dissimilarity. In a first experiment, a set of participants is involved in order to evaluate the human response with respect to a simple judgment protocol based on two-alternative forced choice. Triplets of face stimuli are evaluated first with the aim of identifying (between two candidate faces) the face more similar to a reference face. The protocol is then repeated for the same triplets but involving a different set of participants and asking to identify the face less similar to a reference face. These visual judgments of similarity and dissimilarity are finally analyzed and compared with the results of a closely related computational experiment based on the same set of triplets; in this case, however, the similarity-dissimilarity measure is derived by automatically extracting facial points and matching with regression techniques (LASSO and Elastic Net) two configurations of image descriptors: the first capturing holistic information, the second capturing local information, that is few localized facial features. Our results suggest that computational models based on holistic cues (emphasizing the concept of the whole as a composed set of interdependent parts) better fit judgments of humans participating to the first experiment (similarity judgments). On the other hand, models based on spatially localized cues do not offer significant accuracy. Vice versa, computational models based on local cues better fit dissimilarity judgments and are less adequate to express similarity information. Notably, our results provide some empirical evidence that local and global cues are both important in face perception, but with different roles. This finding supports the hypothesis that similarity and dissimilarity should not merely be considered as opposing concepts, as they could derive from different processing paths.",2019,Image Vis.

Change-point estimation in high dimensional linear regression models via sparse group Lasso,"In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating change-points in a high dimensional linear regression model. In the model considered, the linear coefficients have high dimensions, are sparse, and undergo multiple changes in the given data samples. Our goal is to estimate the number and locations of change-points and sparse coefficients in each of the intervals between change-points. We develop a sparse group Lasso (SGL) based approach to solve the proposed problem. Under certain assumptions and using a properly chosen regularization parameter, we show that estimation error of linear coefficients and change-point locations can be expressed as a function of the number of data point, the dimension of the model and the sparse level. From the derived error function, we then characterize the conditions under which the proposed estimator is consistent. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the performance of our approach.",2015,"2015 53rd Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)"
A robust multiple-locus method for quantitative trait locus analysis of non-normally distributed multiple traits,"Linear regression-based quantitative trait loci/association mapping methods such as least squares commonly assume normality of residuals. In genetics studies of plants or animals, some quantitative traits may not follow normal distribution because the data include outlying observations or data that are collected from multiple sources, and in such cases the normal regression methods may lose some statistical power to detect quantitative trait loci. In this work, we propose a robust multiple-locus regression approach for analyzing multiple quantitative traits without normality assumption. In our method, the objective function is least absolute deviation (LAD), which corresponds to the assumption of multivariate Laplace distributed residual errors. This distribution has heavier tails than the normal distribution. In addition, we adopt a group LASSO penalty to produce shrinkage estimation of the marker effects and to describe the genetic correlation among phenotypes. Our LAD-LASSO approach is less sensitive to the outliers and is more appropriate for the analysis of data with skewedly distributed phenotypes. Another application of our robust approach is on missing phenotype problem in multiple-trait analysis, where the missing phenotype items can simply be filled with some extreme values, and be treated as outliers. The efficiency of the LAD-LASSO approach is illustrated on both simulated and real data sets.",2015,Heredity
"Exploring Spatial Trends and Influencing Factors for Gastric Cancer Based on Bayesian Statistics: A Case Study of Shanxi, China","Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. To detect the spatial trends of GC risk based on hospital-diagnosed patients, this study presented a selection probability model and integrated it into the Bayesian spatial statistical model. Then, the spatial pattern of GC risk in Shanxi Province in north central China was estimated. In addition, factors influencing GC were investigated mainly using the Bayesian Lasso model. The spatial variability of GC risk in Shanxi has the conspicuous feature of being 'high in the south and low in the north'. The highest GC relative risk was 1.291 (95% highest posterior density: 0.789â»4.002). The univariable analysis and Bayesian Lasso regression results showed that a diverse dietary structure and increased consumption of beef and cow milk were significantly (p â‰¤ 0.08) and in high probability (greater than 68%) negatively associated with GC risk. Pork production per capita has a positive correlation with GC risk. Moreover, four geographic factors, namely, temperature, terrain, vegetation cover, and precipitation, showed significant (p < 0.05) associations with GC risk based on univariable analysis, and associated with GC risks in high probability (greater than 60%) inferred from Bayesian Lasso regression model.",2018,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
Quantifying the Relationship between Adaptive Traits and Agro-climatic Conditions,"Background & Aim: Durum wheat is an economically important and regularly eaten food forÂ  billions of people in the world. In the International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), genbanks are using Focused Identification of the Germplasm Strategy (FIGS) to find out and quantify relationships between agro-climatic conditions and the presence of specific traits. Hence, the study is aimed to investigate the predictive value of various types of long-term agro-climatic variables on the future values of different traits. 
Method: Ordinary multiple linear regression with stepwise variable selection method on the complete data set, and multiple linear regression models with predictors selected by penalized methods with mean square error cross-validation as a model selection criterion, are used to analyze 238 durum wheat landraces. Each of the models are fitted on Days to Heading and Days to Maturity response variables with 57 predictor variables, independently. Ordinary least square and weighted least square estimation methods were used. 
Result: Findings implied that there is high multicollinearity among the predictor variables. It is found that there are some predictors which affect positively and some others affect negatively for both Days to Heading and Days to Maturity using both ordinary and shrinkage based models. It is revealed that the prediction from the lasso based model is not that much reasonable. Furthermore, for the Days to Heading showed that there seems better prediction as their predicted value increase continuously as a function of the actual values though there is considerable variability. 
Conclusion: In conclusion, inferences and predictions by the ordinary MLR models are not trusted due to the presence of multicollinearity, and violation of some model assumptions. However, predictions using the models with predictors selected by the shrinkage methods may be better as the effects of the variability on these methods are minimal. Moreover, the WLS methods might give more sensible predictions than the OLS estimation methods. Better predictions were found on the Days to Heading.",2020,
Variable Selection via Biased Estimators in the Linear Regression Model,"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) is used for variable selection as well as for handling the multicollinearity problem simultaneously in the linear regression model. LASSO produces estimates having high variance if the number of predictors is higher than the number of observations and if high multicollinearity exists among the predictor variables. To handle this problem, Elastic Net (ENet) estimator was introduced by combining LASSO and Ridge estimator (RE). The solutions of LASSO and ENet have been obtained using Least Angle Regression (LARS) and LARS-EN algorithms, respectively. In this article, we proposed an alternative algorithm to overcome the issues in LASSO that can be combined LASSO with other exiting biased estimators namely Almost Unbiased Ridge Estimator (AURE), Liu Estimator (LE), Almost Unbiased Liu Estimator (AULE), Principal Component Regression Estimator (PCRE), r-k class estimator and r-d class estimator. Further, we examine the performance of the proposed algorithm using a Monte-Carlo simulation study and real-world examples. The results showed that the LARS-rk and LARS-rd algorithms,Â which are combined LASSO with r-k class estimator and r-d class estimator,Â outperformed other algorithms under the moderated and severe multicollinearity.",2020,Open Journal of Statistics
A two-stage minimax concave penalty based method in pruned AdaBoost ensemble,"Abstract AdaBoost is a highly effective ensemble learning method that combines several weak learners to produce a strong committee with higher accuracy. However, similar to other ensemble methods, AdaBoost uses a large number of base learners to produce the final outcome while addressing high-dimensional data. Thus, it poses a critical challenge in the form of high memory-space consumption. Feature selection methods can significantly reduce dimensionality in regression and have been established to be applicable in ensemble pruning. By pruning the ensemble, it is possible to generate a simpler ensemble with fewer base learners but a higher accuracy. In this article, we propose the minimax concave penalty (MCP) function to prune an AdaBoost ensemble to simplify the model and improve its accuracy simultaneously. The MCP penalty function is compared with LASSO and SCAD in terms of performance in pruning the ensemble. Experiments performed on real datasets demonstrate that MCP-pruning outperforms the other two methods. It can reduce the ensemble size effectively, and generate marginally more accurate predictions than the unpruned AdaBoost model.",2019,Appl. Soft Comput.
A Bayesian Framework for Robust Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping and Outlier Detection.,"We introduce a Bayesian framework for simultaneous feature selection and outlier detection in sparse high-dimensional regression models, with a focus on quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in experimental crosses. More specifically, we incorporate the robust mean shift outlier handling mechanism into the multiple QTL mapping regression model and apply LASSO regularization concurrently to the genetic effects and the mean-shift terms through the flexible extended Bayesian LASSO (EBL) prior structure, thereby combining QTL mapping and outlier detection into a single sparse model representation problem. The EBL priors on the mean-shift terms prevent outlying phenotypic values from distorting the genotype-phenotype association and allows their detection as cases with outstanding mean shift values following the LASSO shrinkage. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new methodology at mapping QTLs in the presence of outlying phenotypic values and simultaneously identifying the potential outliers, while maintaining a comparable performance to the standard EBL on outlier-free data.",2020,The international journal of biostatistics
Method of Divide-and-Combine in Regularised Generalised Linear Models for Big Data,"When a data set is too big to be analysed entirely once by a single computer, the strategy of divide-and-combine has been the method of choice to overcome the computational hurdle due to its scalability. Although random data partition has been widely adopted, there is lack of clear theoretical justification and practical guidelines to combine results obtained from separate analysis of individual sub-datasets, especially when a regularisation method such as lasso is utilised for variable selection to improve numerical stability. In this paper we develop a new strategy to combine separate lasso-type estimates of regression parameters by the means of the confidence distributions based on bias-corrected estimators. We first establish the approach to the construction of the confidence distribution and then show that the resulting combined estimator enjoys the Fisher's efficiency in the sense of the estimation efficiency achieved by the maximum likelihood estimator from the analysis of full data. Furthermore, using the combined regularised estimator we propose an inference procedure. Extensive simulation studies are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology with comparisons to the classical meta estimation method and a voting-based variable selection method.",2016,arXiv: Methodology
Abnormal Emotional Processing and Emotional Experience in Patients with Peripheral Facial Nerve Paralysis: An MEG Study,"Abnormal emotional reactions of the brain in patients with facial nerve paralysis have not yet been reported. This study aims to investigate this issue by applying a machine-learning algorithm that discriminates brain emotional activities that belong either to patients with facial nerve paralysis or to healthy controls. Beyond this, we assess an emotion rating task to determine whether there are differences in their experience of emotions. MEG signals of 17 healthy controls and 16 patients with facial nerve paralysis were recorded in response to picture stimuli in three different emotional categories (pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral). The selected machine learning technique in this study was the logistic regression with LASSO regularization. We demonstrated significant classification performances in all three emotional categories. The best classification performance was achieved considering features based on event-related fields in response to the pleasant category, with an accuracy of 0.79 (95% CI (0.70, 0.82)). We also found that patients with facial nerve paralysis rated pleasant stimuli significantly more positively than healthy controls. Our results indicate that the inability to express facial expressions due to peripheral motor paralysis of the face might cause abnormal brain emotional processing and experience of particular emotions.",2020,Brain Sciences
Sparse High-Dimensional Regression: Exact Scalable Algorithms and Phase Transitions,"We present a novel binary convex reformulation of the sparse regression problem that constitutes a new duality perspective. We devise a new cutting plane method and provide evidence that it can solve to provable optimality the sparse regression problem for sample sizes n and number of regressors p in the 100,000s, that is two orders of magnitude better than the current state of the art, in seconds. The ability to solve the problem for very high dimensions allows us to observe new phase transition phenomena. Contrary to traditional complexity theory which suggests that the difficulty of a problem increases with problem size, the sparse regression problem has the property that as the number of samples $n$ increases the problem becomes easier in that the solution recovers 100% of the true signal, and our approach solves the problem extremely fast (in fact faster than Lasso), while for small number of samples n, our approach takes a larger amount of time to solve the problem, but importantly the optimal solution provides a statistically more relevant regressor. We argue that our exact sparse regression approach presents a superior alternative over heuristic methods available at present.",2017,arXiv: Optimization and Control
New Gibbs sampling methods for bayesian regularized quantile regression,"In this paper, we propose new Bayesian hierarchical representations of lasso, adaptive lasso and elastic net quantile regression models. We explore these representations by observing that the lasso penalty function corresponds to a scale mixture of truncated normal distribution (with exponential mixing densities). We consider fully Bayesian treatments that lead to new Gibbs sampler methods with tractable full conditional posteriors. The new methods are then illustrated with both simulated and real data. Results show that the new methods perform very well under a variety of simulations, such as the presence of a moderately large number of predictors, collinearity and heterogeneity.",2019,Computers in biology and medicine

Data mining-based detection of rapid growth in length of stay on COPD patients,"Background: Due to the rapid development in industrialization and urbanization, air pollution has aggravated in the past few years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has become the world's fourth leading cause of death. Through the study of factors affecting medical cost, we find that there is a strong correlation between medical cost and length of stay (LOS). Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and predict the LOS for patients with COPD. Objective: To identify COPD patients with rapidly increased LOS next year by the method of data mining. Methods: Based on the data from healthcare survey data in one city of China, we extracted the 36985 patients with COPD who had been admitted to hospital, from January 2011 to December 2012. On the basis of LASSO Logistic regression and random forests (RF), we established the prediction models. Results: The precision and accuracy of the method was proved correct and reliable (the AUC of LASSO: 0.62, the AUC of RF: 0.63) when employing 29 factors. Conclusion: This study provides an accurate and applicable method to detection the potential patients who are most likely to rapid growth in LOS.",2017,2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Big Data Analysis (ICBDA)(
Machine learning on density and elastic property of oxide glasses driven by large dataset,"Abstract We conduct a comprehensive machine learning study on predicting the oxide glasses density, Young's modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio given compositions, by leveraging the large dataset collected at Corning Incorporated. The density and elastic property datasets have the size of 24,858 and 8519, respectively. Our results show that random forest, K-Nearest neighbor, and neural networks consistently deliver good performance, while support vector machine consistently underperforms. Lasso linear regression works best for density prediction, while Poisson's ratio is extremely challenging to predict with the best R2 score achieved to be around 0.7 by random forest. Additionally, feature importance analysis shows that La2O3 and BaO are the top two features for density prediction, while Na2O and B2O3 for Young's modulus and shear modulus prediction, and CaO and SiO2 for Poisson's ratio prediction. The study could be potentially leveraged as the baseline by future studies given the large dataset we trained on.",2020,Journal of Non-crystalline Solids
Participation rates of in-class vs. online administration of low-stakes research-based assessments,"This study investigates differences in student participation rates between in-class and online administrations of research-based assessments. A sample of 1,310 students from 25 sections of 3 different introductory physics courses over two semesters were instructed to complete the CLASS attitudinal survey and the concept inventory relevant to their course, either the FCI or the CSEM. Each student was randomly assigned to take one of the surveys in class and the other survey online at home using the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes (LASSO) platform. Results indicate large variations in participation rates across both test conditions (online and in class). A hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM) of the student data utilizing logistic regression indicates that student grades in the course and faculty assessment administration practices were both significant predictors of student participation. When the recommended online assessments administration practices were implemented, participation rates were similar across test conditions. Implications for student and course assessment methodologies will be discussed.",2017,arXiv: Physics Education
GWAS-based Machine Learning for Prediction of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Risk,"Numerous independent susceptibility variants have been identified for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Since advanced AMD is currently incurable, an accurate prediction of a person9s AMD risk using genetic information is desirable for early diagnosis and clinical management. In this study, genotype data of 32,215 Caucasian individuals with age above 50 years from the International AMD Genomics Consortium in dbGAP were used to establish and validate prediction models for AMD risk using four different machine learning approaches: neural network, lasso regression, support vector machine, and random forest. A standard logistic regression model was also considered using a genetic risk score. To identify feature SNPs for AMD prediction models, we selected the genome-wide significant SNPs from GWAS. All methods achieved good performance for predicting normal controls versus advanced AMD cases (AUC=0.81~0.82 in a separate test dataset) and normal controls versus any AMD (AUC=0.78~0.79). By applying the state-of-art machine learning approaches on the large AMD GWAS data, the predictive models we established can provide an accurate estimation of an individual9s AMD risk profile across the person9s lifespan based on a comprehensive genetic information.",2019,medRxiv
Kernel Basis Pursuit,"Estimating a non-uniformly sampled function from a set of learning points is a classical regression problem. Kernel methods have been widely used in this context, but every problem leads to two major tasks: optimizing the kernel and setting the fitness-regularization compromise. This article presents a new method to estimate a function from noisy learning points in the context of RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space). We introduce the Kernel Basis Pursuit algorithm, which enables us to build a L 1 -regularized-multiple-kernel estimator. The general idea is to decompose the function to learn on a sparse-optimal set of spanning functions. Our implementation relies on the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) formulation and on the Least Angle Regression Stepwise (LARS) solver. The computation ofthe full regularization path, through the LARS, will enable us to propose new adaptive criteria to find an optimal fitness-regularization compromise. Finally, we aim at proposing a fast parameter-free method to estimate non-uniform-sampled functions.",2005,
A novel variational Bayes multiple locus Z-statistic for genome-wide association studies with Bayesian model averaging,"MOTIVATION
For many complex traits, including height, the majority of variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have small effects, leaving a significant proportion of the heritable variation unexplained. Although many penalized multiple regression methodologies have been proposed to increase the power to detect associations for complex genetic architectures, they generally lack mechanisms for false-positive control and diagnostics for model over-fitting. Our methodology is the first penalized multiple regression approach that explicitly controls Type I error rates and provide model over-fitting diagnostics through a novel normally distributed statistic defined for every marker within the GWAS, based on results from a variational Bayes spike regression algorithm.


RESULTS
We compare the performance of our method to the lasso and single marker analysis on simulated data and demonstrate that our approach has superior performance in terms of power and Type I error control. In addition, using the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) GWAS of African-Americans, we show that our method has power to detect additional novel associations with body height. These findings replicate by reaching a stringent cutoff of marginal association in a larger cohort.

Development of a Brief Version of the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM): The COMM-9,"Objective
The Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) is a commonly used self-report instrument to identify and monitor aberrant opioid-related behavior in chronic pain patients on opioid therapy. However, the length of the COMM may limit its clinical utility. Additionally, this paper-and-pencil screener requires hand scoring, which increases paperwork and staff burden. Therefore, the current study presents development of the ""COMM-9,"" a brief electronically administered form of the COMM.


Methods
Patients (Nâ€‰=â€‰517) with chronic noncancer pain on opioid therapy completed the COMM. Patients were classified as either being positive or negative for aberrant drug-related behavior based on self-report data from a structured interview, physician-report data, and urine toxicology screen (the Aberrant Drug Behavior Index [ADBI]). COMM items with the strongest classification accuracy were identified using the LASSO method as the selection criterion in conjunction with the leave-one-out cross-validation method as the stop criterion. A sub-set of patients (n=55) completed a second administration of the COMM one week later to evaluate test-retest reliability.


Results
Nine items were identified before the selection criterion stopped, and logistic regression was utilized to predict probabilities of positive ADBI from the 9 COMM items using all data and the cross-validation procedure. Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed high levels of classification accuracy that were essentially equivalent to the full COMM. Cut-points were identified to classify patients as having no/low risk, moderate risk, and high risk for aberrant opioid-related behavior. Test-retest reliability of the COMM-9 was comparable to the full 17-item COMM.


Conclusions
This study presents the successful development of a brief electronic screener to identify current aberrant opioid-related behavior in chronic pain patients on long-term opioid therapy.",2019,Pain Medicine
A Two Biomarker Model Augments Clinical Prediction of Mortality in Melioidosis.,"BACKGROUND
Melioidosis, infection caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a common cause of sepsis with high associated mortality in Southeast Asia. Identification of patients at high-likelihood of clinical deterioration is important for guiding decisions about resource allocation and management. We sought to develop a biomarker-based model for 28-day mortality prediction in melioidosis.


METHODS
In a derivation set (N=113) of prospectively enrolled, hospitalized Thai patients with melioidosis, we measured concentrations of interferon-Î³, interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and interleukin-17A. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to identify a subset of predictive biomarkers and performed logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to evaluate biomarker-based prediction of 28-day mortality compared to clinical variables. We repeated select analyses in an internal validation set (N=78) and in a prospectively enrolled external validation set (N=161) of hospitalized adults with melioidosis in Thailand.


RESULTS
All eight cytokines were positively associated with 28-day mortality. Of these, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 were selected by LASSO regression. A model consisting of interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and clinical variables significantly improved 28-day mortality prediction over a model of only clinical variables (AUC 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.92 vs AUC 0.78, 95% CI 0.69-0.87; P=0.01). In both the internal validation set (AUC 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.97) and the external validation set (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.88), the combined model including biomarkers significantly improved 28-day mortality prediction over a model limited to clinical variables.


CONCLUSIONS
A two biomarker model augments clinical prediction of 28-day mortality in melioidosis.",2020,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America
Immune Landscape of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Tumor Microenvironment Identifies a Prognostic and Immunotherapeutically Relevant Gene Signature,"Background Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is a clinically and molecularly distinct disease. Tumour microenvironment (TME) immune phenotypes play crucial roles in predicting clinical outcomes and therapeutic efficacy. Method In this study, we depict the immune landscape of IDC by using transcriptome profiling and clinical characteristics retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. Immune cell infiltration was evaluated via single-sample gene set enrichment (ssGSEA) analysis and systematically correlated with genomic characteristics and clinicopathological features of IDC patients. Furthermore, an immune signature was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression algorithm. A random forest algorithm was applied to identify the most important somatic gene mutations associated with the constructed immune signature. A nomogram that integrated clinicopathological features with the immune signature to predict survival probability was constructed by multivariate Cox regression. Results The IDC were clustered into low immune infiltration, intermediate immune infiltration, and high immune infiltration by the immune landscape. The high infiltration group had a favourable survival probability compared with that of the low infiltration group. The low-risk score subtype identified by the immune signature was characterized by T cell-mediated immune activation. Additionally, activation of the interferon-Î± response, interferon-Î³ response and TNF-Î± signalling via the NFÎºB pathway was observed in the low-risk score subtype, which indicated T cell activation and may be responsible for significantly favourable outcomes in IDC patients. A random forest algorithm identified the most important somatic gene mutations associated with the constructed immune signature. Furthermore, a nomogram that integrated clinicopathological features with the immune signature to predict survival probability was constructed, revealing that the immune signature was an independent prognostic biomarker. Finally, the relationship of VEGFA, PD1, PDL-1 and CTLA-4 expression with the immune infiltration landscape and the immune signature was analysed to interpret the responses of IDC patients to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Conclusion Taken together, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the immune landscape of IDC and constructed an immune signature related to the immune landscape. This analysis of TME immune infiltration patterns has shed light on how IDC respond to immune checkpoint therapy and may guide the development of novel drug combination strategies.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
CT-Based Radiomic Signature as a Prognostic Factor in Stage IV ALK-Positive Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Treated With TKI Crizotinib: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"Objectives: To identify a computed tomography (CT)-based radiomic signature for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) in stage IV anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib. Materials and Methods: This retrospective proof-of-concept study included a cohort of 63 stage IV ALK-positive NSCLC patients who had received TKI crizotinib therapy for model construction and validation. Another independent cohort including 105 stage IV EGFR-positive NSCLC patients was also used for external validation in EGFR-TKI treatment. We initially extracted 481 quantitative three-dimensional features derived from manually segmented tumor volumes of interest. Pearson's correlation analysis along with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized Cox proportional hazards regression was successively performed to select critical radiomic features. A CT-based radiomic signature for PFS prediction was obtained using multivariate Cox regression. The performance evaluation of the radiomic signature was conducted using the concordance index (C-index), time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and Kaplanâ€“Meier survival analysis. Results: A radiomic signature containing three features showed significant prognostic performance for ALK-positive NSCLC patients in both the training cohort (C-index, 0.744; time-dependent AUC, 0.895) and the validation cohort (C-index, 0.717; time-dependent AUC, 0.824). The radiomic signature could significantly risk-stratify ALK-positive NSCLC patients (hazard ratio, 2.181; P < 0.001) and outperformed other prognostic factors. However, no significant association with PFS was captured for the radiomic signature in the EGFR-positive NSCLC cohort (log-rank tests, P = 0.41). Conclusions: The CT-based radiomic features can capture valuable information regarding the tumor phenotype. The proposed radiomic signature was found to be an effective prognostic factor in stage IV ALK mutated nonsynchronous nodules in NSCLC patients treated with a TKI.",2020,Frontiers in Oncology
Inequality across US counties: an S factor analysis,"A dataset of socioeconomic, demographic and geographic data for US counties (Nâ‰ˆ3,100) was created by merging data from several sources. A suitable subset of 28 socioeconomic indicators was chosen for analysis. Factor analysis revealed a clear general socioeconomic factor (S factor) which was stable across extraction methods and different samples of indicators (absolute split-half sampling reliability = .85). 
 
Self-identified race/ethnicity (SIRE) population percentages were strongly, but non-linearly, related to cognitive ability and S. In general, the effect of White% and Asian% were positive, while those for Black%, Hispanic% and Amerindian% were negative. The effect was unclear for Other/mixed%. The best model consisted of White%, Black%, Asian% and Amerindian% and explained 41/43% of the variance in cognitive ability/S among counties. 
 
SIRE homogeneity had a non-linear relationship to S, both with and without taking into account the effects of SIRE variables. Overall, the effect was slightly negative due to low S, high White% areas. 
Geospatial (latitude, longitude, and elevation) and climatological (temperature, precipitation) predictors were tested in models. In linear regression, they had little incremental validity. However, there was evidence of non-linear relationships. When models were fitted that allowed for non-linear effects of the environmental predictors, they were able to add a moderate amount of incremental validity. LASSO regression, however, suggested that much of this predictive validity was due to overfitting. Furthermore, it was difficult to make causal sense of the results. 
 
Spatial patterns in the data were examined using multiple methods, all of which indicated strong spatial autocorrelation for cognitive ability, S and SIRE (k nearest spatial neighbor regression [KNSNR] correlations of .62 to .89). Model residuals were also spatially autocorrelated, and for this reason the models were re-fit controlling for spatial autocorrelation using KNSNR-based residuals and spatial local regression. The results indicated that the effects of SIREs were not due to spatially autocorrelated confounds except possibly for Black% which was about 50% weaker in the controlled analyses. 
 
Pseudo-multilevel analyses of both the factor structure of S and the SIRE predictive model showed results consistent with the main analyses. Specifically, the factor structure was similar across levels of analysis (states and counties) and within states. Furthermore, the SIRE predictors had similar betas when examined within each state compared to when analyzed across all states. 
 
It was tested whether the relationship between SIREs and S was mediated by cognitive ability. Several methods were used to examine this question and the results were mixed, but generally in line with a partial mediation model. 
 
Jensen's method (method of correlated vectors) was used to examine whether the observed relationship between cognitive ability and S scores was plausibly due to the latent S factor. This was strongly supported (r = .91, Nindicators=28). Similarly, it was examined whether the relationship between SIREs and S scores was plausibly due to the latent S factor. This did not appear to be the case.",2016,
A Tutorial on Model-Assisted Estimation with Application to Forest Inventory,"National forest inventories in many countries combine expensive ground plot data with remotely-sensed information to improve precision in estimators of forest parameters. A simple post-stratified estimator is often the tool of choice because it has known statistical properties, is easy to implement, and is intuitive to the many users of inventory data. Because of the increased availability of remotely-sensed data with improved spatial, temporal, and thematic resolutions, there is a need to equip the inventory community with a more diverse array of statistical estimators. Focusing on generalized regression estimators, we step the reader through seven estimators including: Horvitz Thompson, ratio, post-stratification, regression, lasso, ridge, and elastic net. Using forest inventory data from Daggett county in Utah, USA as an example, we illustrate how to construct, as well as compare the relative performance of, these estimators. Augmented by simulations, we also show how the standard variance estimator suffers from greater negative bias than the bootstrap variance estimator, especially as the size of the assisting model grows. Each estimator is made readily accessible through the new R package, mase. We conclude with guidelines in the form of a decision tree on when to use which an estimator in forest inventory applications.",2020,Forests
Genomic growth curves of an outbred pig population,"In the current post-genomic era, the genetic basis of pig growth can be understood by assessing SNP marker effects and genomic breeding values (GEBV) based on estimates of these growth curve parameters as phenotypes. Although various statistical methods, such as random regression (RR-BLUP) and Bayesian LASSO (BL), have been applied to genomic selection (GS), none of these has yet been used in a growth curve approach. In this work, we compared the accuracies of RR-BLUP and BL using empirical weight-age data from an outbred F2 (Brazilian Piau X commercial) population. The phenotypes were determined by parameter estimates using a nonlinear logistic regression model and the halothane gene was considered as a marker for evaluating the assumptions of the GS methods in relation to the genetic variation explained by each locus. BL yielded more accurate values for all of the phenotypes evaluated and was used to estimate SNP effects and GEBV vectors. The latter allowed the construction of genomic growth curves, which showed substantial genetic discrimination among animals in the final growth phase. The SNP effect estimates allowed identification of the most relevant markers for each phenotype, the positions of which were coincident with reported QTL regions for growth traits.",2013,Genetics and Molecular Biology

A Bayesian LASSO Algorithm for Simultaneous Variation Fault Diagnosis in Ill Conditioned Multistage Manufacturing Processes,"Fault diagnosis is an effective way to address the dimensional quality challenges by identifying failing process characteristics in multistage manufacturing processes. A significant number of literature is found addressing the problem with an implicit assumption of number of measurement points exceeds the number of process error sources. In reality due to economical constraints this assumption is frequently violated, resulting into an illconditioned process that provides less than full column rank models to describe the relationship between the product quality and process error sources. Under such circumstances, no mathematically unique solution do exist which is a hindrance in accurately diagnosing the faults arising. In this study, the fault diagnosis problem in such processes is presented as a variable selection problem and assuming sparsity of faults, an amalgamation of state space model and Bayesian Hierarchical Model for LASSO based regularized regression is adopted. To estimate the failing process elements through the Bayesian LASSO problem the popular stochastic simulation methods, viz., Gibbs Sampling is employed. A floor pan assembly problem is studied to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. Results obtained are promising and effective in successfully identifying process faults.",2015,
