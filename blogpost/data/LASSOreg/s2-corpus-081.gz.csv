Detecting rare and common haplotype-environment interaction under uncertainty of gene-environment independence assumption.,"Finding rare variants and gene-environment interactions (GXE) is critical in dissecting complex diseases. We consider the problem of detecting GXE where G is a rare haplotype and E is a nongenetic factor. Such methods typically assume G-E independence, which may not hold in many applications. A pertinent example is lung cancer-there is evidence that variants on Chromosome 15q25.1 interact with smoking to affect the risk. However, these variants are associated with smoking behavior rendering the assumption of G-E independence inappropriate. With the motivation of detecting GXE under G-E dependence, we extend an existing approach, logistic Bayesian LASSO, which assumes G-E independence (LBL-GXE-I) by modeling G-E dependence through a multinomial logistic regression (referred to as LBL-GXE-D). Unlike LBL-GXE-I, LBL-GXE-D controls type I error rates in all situations; however, it has reduced power when G-E independence holds. To control type I error without sacrificing power, we further propose a unified approach, LBL-GXE, to incorporate uncertainty in the G-E independence assumption by employing a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Our simulations show that LBL-GXE has power similar to that of LBL-GXE-I when G-E independence holds, yet has well-controlled type I errors in all situations. To illustrate the utility of LBL-GXE, we analyzed a lung cancer dataset and found several significant interactions in the 15q25.1 region, including one between a specific rare haplotype and smoking.",2017,Biometrics
Comparing high-dimensional confounder control methods for rapid cohort studies from electronic health records,"AIMS
Electronic health records (EHR), containing rich clinical histories of large patient populations, can provide evidence for clinical decisions when evidence from trials and literature is absent. To enable such observational studies from EHR in real time, particularly in emergencies, rapid confounder control methods that can handle numerous variables and adjust for biases are imperative. This study compares the performance of 18 automatic confounder control methods.


METHODS
Methods include propensity scores, direct adjustment by machine learning, similarity matching and resampling in two simulated and one real-world EHR datasets.


RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS
Direct adjustment by lasso regression and ensemble models involving multiple resamples have performance comparable to expert-based propensity scores and thus, may help provide real-time EHR-based evidence for timely clinical decisions.",2016,Journal of Comparative Effectiveness Research
Prendre en compte le profil gÃ©nÃ©tique des patients dans la pharmacocinÃ©tique : quelles mÃ©thodes en analyse de population ?,"La pharmacogenetique (PGt) etudie la part de la variabilite interindividuelle dans la reponse aux traitements expliquee par des variations genetiques.

Gradient lasso for Cox proportional hazards model,"MOTIVATION
There has been an increasing interest in expressing a survival phenotype (e.g. time to cancer recurrence or death) or its distribution in terms of a subset of the expression data of a subset of genes. Due to high dimensionality of gene expression data, however, there is a serious problem of collinearity in fitting a prediction model, e.g. Cox's proportional hazards model. To avoid the collinearity problem, several methods based on penalized Cox proportional hazards models have been proposed. However, those methods suffer from severe computational problems, such as slow or even failed convergence, because of high-dimensional matrix inversions required for model fitting. We propose to implement the penalized Cox regression with a lasso penalty via the gradient lasso algorithm that yields faster convergence to the global optimum than do other algorithms. Moreover the gradient lasso algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimum under mild regularity conditions. Hence, our gradient lasso algorithm can be a useful tool in developing a prediction model based on high-dimensional covariates including gene expression data.


RESULTS
Results from simulation studies showed that the prediction model by gradient lasso recovers the prognostic genes. Also results from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma datasets and Norway/Stanford breast cancer dataset indicate that our method is very competitive compared with popular existing methods by Park and Hastie and Goeman in its computational time, prediction and selectivity.

Retrospective Parental Rejection Is Associated With Aggressive Behavior as Well as Cognitive Distortions in Forensic Psychiatric Outpatients,"Objective: Parental rejection in childhood is associated with the increased risk of aggression in adulthood and is thought to contribute to the development of inaccurate beliefs regarding own or othersâ€™ behavior (i.e., cognitive distortion) as well. Different forms of aggression are thought to be linked to different types of cognitive distortions. This, however, is unclear in adults. Additionally, it is unknown if parental rejection predicts the presence of aggression and cognitive distortions in adults displaying severe aggression. Method: One hundred twenty-three adult forensic psychiatric outpatients with aggression regulation problems were recruited. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression analysis and path analyses were conducted to investigate distinct patterns of cognitive distortions, as measured by use of the How I Think Questionnaire, and the role of perceived parental rejection, as measured by use of the Parental Rejection and Acceptance Questionnaire. Results: Cognitive distortions related to opposition-defiance (e.g., disrespecting rules) and to physical aggression were most strongly associated with the disposition to act aggressively. Furthermore, a direct association was found between parental rejection and this current disposition. This association was partially mediated by cognitive distortions related to opposition-defiance. Conclusion: The current study supports the notion that parental rejection has profound consequences on adult behavior. Acknowledgment of the impact of cognitive distortions on current aggression might be of importance for treatment. A stronger focus on altering distinct cognitive distortions may be more successful in reducing aggression.",2017,Psychology of Violence
The function-on-scalar LASSO with applications to longitudinal GWAS,"We present a new methodology for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation in function-on-scalar regression with an ultra-high dimensional predictor vector. We extend the LASSO to functional data in both the $\textit{dense}$ functional setting and the $\textit{sparse}$ functional setting. We provide theoretical guarantees which allow for an exponential number of predictor variables. Simulations are carried out which illustrate the methodology and compare the sparse/functional methods. Using the Framingham Heart Study, we demonstrate how our tools can be used in genome-wide association studies, finding a number of genetic mutations which affect blood pressure and are therefore important for cardiovascular health.",2016,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Monte Carlo Approximation of Bayes Factors via Mixing with Surrogate Distributions,"By mixing the posterior distribution with a surrogate distribution, of which the normalizing constant is tractable, we describe a new method to estimate the normalizing constant using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We then introduce an accelerated version of the proposed method using the momentum technique. In addition, several extensions are discussed, including (1) a parallel variant, which inserts a sequence of intermediate distributions between the posterior distribution and the surrogate distribution, to further improve the efficiency of the proposed method; (2) the use of the surrogate distribution to help detect potential multimodality of the posterior distribution, upon which a better sampler can be designed utilizing mode jumping algorithms; (3) a new jumping mechanism for general reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that combines the Multiple-try Metropolis and the directional sampling algorithm, which can be used to estimate the normalizing constant when a surrogate distribution is difficult to come by. We illustrate the proposed methods on several statistical models, including the Log-Gaussian Cox process, the Bayesian Lasso, the logistic regression, the Gaussian mixture model, and the g-prior Bayesian variable selection.",2019,arXiv: Computation
Analyzing Falling Weight Deflectometer Data on Curled and Warped Concrete Slabs,"Falling weight deflectometer testing (FWD) is a non-destructive testing method for pavements, which involves measuring the response of a pavement to a a falling weight. For jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCP), the response of the pavement to the FWD load can be used to backcalculate the pavement layer properties, estimate the performance of the joints, and detect voids. Temperature and moisture gradients in the concrete layer of JPCPs induce curvature in the slab, altering the support conditions of the slab throughout the day. This change in support condition can have a significant effect on FWD testing results. 
A combination of computational analyses, interpretation of field trials, and statistical analysis was used to evaluate the effect of slab curvature when interpreting FWD data. It was determined that backcalculation of the modulus of subgrade reaction (k-value), is sensitive to slab curvature, if the equivalent linear temperature gradient (ELTG) in the slab is less than 0.5 Â°F/in especially. for pavements with stiff supporting layers. A backcalculation procedure was developed to backcalculate the modulus of subgrade reaction using FWD testing when positive temperature gradients are present. The measured load transfer efficiency (LTE) for doweled JPCP slabs was found to be at a minimum when the slab is approximately flat and increase as a positive or negative temperature gradient develops. The measured differential deflection for doweled slabs was found to be at a maximum when the slab is approximately flat or with a negative temperature gradient, depending on the condition of the dowels. A void detection model for doweled JPCP pavements was developed using LASSO logistic regression, which outperforms currently available void detection techniques. Finally, a temperature prediction model was developed, which predicts the pavement temperature profile as a function of the weather conditions. The developed models are all packaged in the University of Pittsburgh FWD Analysis of Concretes Slabs (PITT-FACS) web tool, so that they can easily be used by practitioners.",2019,
Urban MV and LV Distribution Grid Topology Estimation via Group Lasso,"The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources poses numerous reliability issues to the urban distribution grid. The topology estimation is a critical step to ensure the robustness of distribution grid operation. However, the bus connectivity and grid topology estimation are usually hard in distribution grids. For example, it is technically challenging and costly to monitor the bus connectivity in urban grids, e.g., underground lines. It is also inappropriate to use the radial topology assumption exclusively because the grids of metropolitan cities and regions with dense loads could be with many mesh structures. To resolve these drawbacks, we propose a data-driven topology estimation method for medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) distribution grids by only utilizing the historical smart meter measurements. Particularly, a probabilistic graphical model is utilized to capture the statistical dependencies amongst bus voltages. We prove that the bus connectivity and grid topology estimation problems, in radial and mesh structures, can be formulated as a linear regression with a least absolute shrinkage regularization on grouped variables (group lasso). Simulations show highly accurate results in eight MV and LV distribution networks at different sizes and 22 topology configurations using Pacific Gas and Electric Company residential smart meter data.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems
Quantitative Measurement of Oligodendrogliomas Histologica Features inPredicting the 1p/19q Co-Deletion Status,"Oligodendrogliomas are characterized by 1p/19q co-deletion, which generally correlates with subjective morphologic features like nuclei circularity ratio and texture features of the cancer nuclei. As cost control becomes more of an issue in medicine, upfront reflex molecular diagnostic testing for lesions like 1p/19q co-deletion may not be appropriate. This paper aims to develop a rigorous, unbiased digital imaging segmentation algorithm and statistical models that can accurately predict the likelihood of 1p/19q co-deletion based on morphology and texture, which would greatly improve cost-effectiveness in clinic trail. In this study, totally 28 gliomas of haematoxylin and eosin stained slides are comprised in this test cohort. Selected areas that had high tumour cell density were digitally analysed with a high-throughput image segmentation algorithm to automatically delineate the boundaries of the cell nuclei. Then we extracted the morphologic features and texture features based on the segmentation result, and applied them in to Lasso-logistic regression to build the correlation between these features with 1p/19q co-deletion status. As a comparison, we also used PAM (Prediction Analysis of Microarrays), RPA (Recursive Partitioning Analysis) to compare the predication performance. We find out that the circularity ratio of the cell, the variance of cell area for each patient, and parts of texture features effect the 1p/19q co-deletion status, and the false prediction rate of leave one out cross validation is at most around 10%. Moreover, we conduct survival analysis and find out two morphologic features and one texture features are significant influential to patientsâ€™ survival time.",2016,Journal of biometrics & biostatistics
An applied analysis of high-dimensional logistic regression,"In the high dimensional setting, we investigate common regularization approaches for fitting logistic regression models with binary response variables. A literature review is provided on generalized linear models, regularization approaches which include the lasso, ridge, elastic net and relaxed lasso, and recent post-selection methods for obtaining p-values of coefficient estimates proposed by Lockhart et. al. and Buhlmann et. al. We consider varying n, p conditions, and assess model performance based on several evaluation metrics such as their sparsity, accuracy and algorithmic time efficiency. Through a simulation study, we find that Buhlmann et. alâ€™s multi sample splitting method performed poorly when selected covariates were highly correlated. When Î» was chosen through cross validation, the elastic net had similar levels of performance as compared to the lasso, but it did not possess the level of sparsity Zou and Hastie have suggested.",2017,
Protein network-based Lasso regression model for the construction of disease-miRNA functional interactions,"BackgroundThere is a growing body of evidence associating microRNAs (miRNAs) with human diseases. MiRNAs are new key players in the disease paradigm demonstrating roles in several human diseases. The functional association between miRNAs and diseases remains largely unclear and far from complete. With the advent of high-throughput functional genomics techniques that infer genes and biological pathways dysregulted in diseases, it is now possible to infer functional association between diseases and biological molecules by integrating disparate biological information.ResultsHere, we first used Lasso regression model to identify miRNAs associated with disease signature as a proof of concept. Then we proposed an integrated approach that uses disease-gene associations from microarray experiments and text mining, and miRNA-gene association from computational predictions and protein networks to build functional associations network between miRNAs and diseases. The findings of the proposed model were validated against gold standard datasets using ROC analysis and results were promising (AUC=0.81). Our protein network-based approach discovered 19 new functional associations between prostate cancer and miRNAs. The new 19 associations were validated using miRNA expression data and clinical profiles and showed to act as diagnostic and prognostic prostate biomarkers. The proposed integrated approach allowed us to reconstruct functional associations between miRNAs and human diseases and uncovered functional roles of newly discovered miRNAs.ConclusionsLasso regression was used to find associations between diseases and miRNAs using their gene signature. Defining miRNA gene signature by integrating the downstream effect of miRNAs demonstrated better performance than the miRNA signature alone. Integrating biological networks and multiple data to define miRNA and disease gene signature demonstrated high performance to uncover new functional associations between miRNAs and diseases.",2013,EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology
A Comparative Study on Bias Regression Methods in the Presence of Multicollinearity Based on Gamma and Chi Square Distributions,"The aim of this study is to compare some regression methods in the presence of multicollinearity problem. This problem makes the estimated regression coefficients by least squares method to be conditional upon the correlated predictor variables in the model. It is also a condition in a set of regression data that have two or more regressors which are redundant and have the same information. Therefore, some regression methods that handle with multicollinearity such as partial least square regression (PLSR), ridge regression (RR) and lasso regression (LR) had reported. In this paper, the methods were compared using simulated data that follows gamma and chi square distributions with P= 4 and 10, and n =60 and 90. All results were compared with each other through Mean Square Log Error (MSLE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R 2 of their estimated values for different methods. The results show that when P =4 and n=60 RR is better methods with gamma distribution, but with chi square distribution PLRS is better methods. Also, when P= 4 and n=90, RR shows better results with gamma distribution but with chi square distribution all methods have equal predictive ability. However, at P =10 and n=60 RR performed better with both gamma and chi square distributions while RR shows better results at both gamma and chi square distributions when P =10 and n=90.

Machine Learning on Graphs,"Many datasets can be looked at as signals over a graph structure. To this end, the field of graphical models has been a fruitful area of research. This thesis examines a model for time series data called the Sticky Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (SHDPHMM), proposed by Emily Fox. It is useful for clustering time series data where the number of hidden states is unknown, which is often the case in practice. The contribution of this thesis is the derivation of the deterministic variational inference update equations for doing inference on the SHDPHMM. This is an improvement over the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm proposed by Fox as it allows for direct assessment of convergence and can run faster. For a noisy signal over the nodes in a graph, the fused lasso can be used as a denoising method. The fused lasso is a particular case of the generalized lasso, a regularized regression problem which encourages sparsity in a linear transformation of the regression coefficients. This thesis completes the picture of equivalences between the generalized lasso, its dual problem, and the subspace constrained lasso (SCL) and its dual problem. The sparsity is directly expressed in the SCL. The structure of this problem allows for codeword screening. Many of the screening methods both of the single shot and sequential variety are derived in this thesis for the SCL, which depends on the structure of the dual problem. Screening in this case is not as effective as it is for the lasso, where it can reduce very large dictionaries to a fraction of the size. However, it is still an important tool which allows for increased speed of solving the SCL and hence the generalized lasso.",2014,
Optimized application of penalized regression methods to diverse genomic data,"MOTIVATION
Penalized regression methods have been adopted widely for high-dimensional feature selection and prediction in many bioinformatic and biostatistical contexts. While their theoretical properties are well-understood, specific methodology for their optimal application to genomic data has not been determined.


RESULTS
Through simulation of contrasting scenarios of correlated high-dimensional survival data, we compared the LASSO, Ridge and Elastic Net penalties for prediction and variable selection. We found that a 2D tuning of the Elastic Net penalties was necessary to avoid mimicking the performance of LASSO or Ridge regression. Furthermore, we found that in a simulated scenario favoring the LASSO penalty, a univariate pre-filter made the Elastic Net behave more like Ridge regression, which was detrimental to prediction performance. We demonstrate the real-life application of these methods to predicting the survival of cancer patients from microarray data, and to classification of obese and lean individuals from metagenomic data. Based on these results, we provide an optimized set of guidelines for the application of penalized regression for reproducible class comparison and prediction with genomic data.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma: Machine learning-based computed tomography radiomics analysis for the prediction of WHO/ISUP grade.,"PURPOSE
To evaluate the performance of machine learning (ML)-based computed tomography (CT) radiomics analysis for discriminating between low grade (WHO/ISUP I-II) and high grade (WHO/ISUP III-IV) clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs).


METHODS
A total of 164 low grade and 107 high grade ccRCCs were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Radiomic features were extracted from corticomedullary phase (CMP) and nephrographic phase (NP) CT images. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to quantify the feature's reproducibility. The training and validation cohort consisted of 163 and 108 cases. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method was used for feature selection. The machine learning (ML) classifiers were k-NearestNeighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of classifiers was mainly evaluated and compared by certain metrics.


RESULTS
Seven CMP features (ICC range, 0.990-0.999) and seven NP features (ICC range, 0.931-0.999) were selected. The accuracy of CMP, NP and the combination of CMP and NP ranged from 82.2%-85.9 %, 82.8%-94.5 % and 86.5%-90.8 % in the training cohort, and 90.7%-95.4%, 77.8%-79.6 % and 91.7%-93.5 % in the validation cohort. The AUC of CMP, NP and the combination of CMP and NP ranged from 0.901 to 0.938, 0.912 to 0.976, 0.948 to 0.968 in the training cohort, and 0.957 to 0.974, 0.856 to 0.875, 0.960 to 0.978 in the validation cohort.

Network-Constrained Group Lasso for High-Dimensional Multinomial Classification with Application to Cancer Subtype Prediction,"Classic multinomial logit model, commonly used in multiclass regression problem, is restricted to few predictors and does not take into account the relationship among variables. It has limited use for genomic data, where the number of genomic features far exceeds the sample size. Genomic features such as gene expressions are usually related by an underlying biological network. Efficient use of the network information is important to improve classification performance as well as the biological interpretability. We proposed a multinomial logit model that is capable of addressing both the high dimensionality of predictors and the underlying network information. Group lasso was used to induce model sparsity, and a network-constraint was imposed to induce the smoothness of the coefficients with respect to the underlying network structure. To deal with the non-smoothness of the objective function in optimization, we developed a proximal gradient algorithm for efficient computation. The proposed model was compared to models with no prior structure information in both simulations and a problem of cancer subtype prediction with real TCGA (the cancer genome atlas) gene expression data. The network-constrained mode outperformed the traditional ones in both cases.",2014,Cancer Informatics
Predicting mortality over different time horizons: which data elements are needed?,"Objective: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a resource for â€œbig dataâ€ analytics, containing a variety of data elements. We investigate how different categories of information contribute to prediction of mortality over different time horizons among patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment. Material and Methods: We derived prediction models for mortality over 7 time horizons using EHR data on older patients from a national chain of dialysis clinics linked with administrative data using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression. We assessed how different categories of information relate to risk assessment and compared discrete models to time-to-event models. Results: The best predictors used all the available data (c-statistic ranged from 0.72â€“0.76), with stronger models in the near term. While different variable groups showed different utility, exclusion of any particular group did not lead to a meaningfully different risk assessment. Discrete time models performed better than time-to-event models. Conclusions: Different variable groups were predictive over different time horizons, with vital signs most predictive for near-term mortality and demographic and comorbidities more important in long-term mortality.",2017,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association
Nearly optimal Bayesian Shrinkage for High Dimensional Regression,"During the past decade, shrinkage priors have received much attention in Bayesian analysis of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we study the problem for high-dimensional linear regression models. We show that if the shrinkage prior has a heavy and flat tail, and allocates a sufficiently large probability mass in a very small neighborhood of zero, then its posterior properties are as good as those of the spike-and-slab prior. While enjoying its efficiency in Bayesian computation, the shrinkage prior can lead to a nearly optimal contraction rate and selection consistency as the spike-and-slab prior. Our numerical results show that under posterior consistency, Bayesian methods can yield much better results in variable selection than the regularization methods, such as Lasso and SCAD. We also establish a Bernstein von-Mises type results comparable to Castillo et al (2015), this result leads to a convenient way to quantify uncertainties of the regression coefficient estimates, which has been beyond the ability of regularization methods.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Variable Selection With the Strong Heredity Constraint and Its Oracle Property,"In this paper, we extend the LASSO method (Tibshirani 1996) for simultaneously fitting a regression model and identifying important interaction terms. Unlike most of the existing variable selection methods, our method automatically enforces the heredity constraint, that is, an interaction term can be included in the model only if the corresponding main terms are also included in the model. Furthermore, we extend our method to generalized linear models, and show that it performs as well as if the true model were given in advance, that is, the oracle property as in Fan and Li (2001) and Fan and Peng (2004). The proof of the oracle property is given in online supplemental materials. Numerical results on both simulation data and real data indicate that our method tends to remove irrelevant variables more effectively and provide better prediction performance than previous work (Yuan, Joseph, and Lin 2007 and Zhao, Rocha, and Yu 2009 as well as the classical LASSO method).",2010,Journal of the American Statistical Association
A New Family of Error Distributions for Bayesian Quantile Regression,"We propose a new family of error distributions for model-based quantile regression, which is constructed through a structured mixture of normal distributions. The construction enables fixing specific percentiles of the distribution while, at the same time, allowing for varying mode, skewness and tail behavior. It thus overcomes the severe limitation of the asymmetric Laplace distribution -- the most commonly used error model for parametric quantile regression -- for which the skewness of the error density is fully specified when a particular percentile is fixed. We develop a Bayesian formulation for the proposed quantile regression model, including conditional lasso regularized quantile regression based on a hierarchical Laplace prior for the regression coefficients, and a Tobit quantile regression model. Posterior inference is implemented via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The flexibility of the new model relative to the asymmetric Laplace distribution is studied through relevant model properties, and through a simulation experiment to compare the two error distributions in regularized quantile regression. Moreover, model performance in linear quantile regression, regularized quantile regression, and Tobit quantile regression is illustrated with data examples that have been previously considered in the literature.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Electrocorticographic dynamics predict visually guided motor imagery of grasp shaping,"Identification of intended movement type and movement phase of hand grasp shaping are critical features for the control of volitional neuroprosthetics. We demonstrate that neural dynamics during visually-guided imagined grasp shaping can encode intended movement. We apply Procrustes analysis and LASSO regression to achieve 72% accuracy (chance = 25%) in distinguishing between visually-guided imagined grasp trajectories. Further, we can predict the stage of grasp shaping in the form of elapsed time from start of trial (R2=0.4). Our approach contributes to more accurate single-trial decoding of higher-level movement goals and the phase of grasping movements in individuals not trained with brain-computer interfaces. We also find that the overall time-varying trajectory structure of imagined movements tend to be consistent within individuals, and that transient trajectory deviations within trials return to the task-dependent trajectory mean. These overall findings may contribute to the further understanding of the cortical dynamics of human motor imagery.",2017,2017 8th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)

Identification and Validation of a Potent Multi-miRNA Signature for Prediction of Prognosis of Osteosarcoma Patients,"BACKGROUND Osteosarcoma, the most common solid malignancy, has high incidence and mortality rates. We constructed a miRNA-based signature that can be used to assess the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The miRNA profile was derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website, with matched clinical records. The miRNA-based overall survival (OS)-predicting signature was established by LASSO Cox regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analyses were performed to examine the stability and discriminatory ability of the OS-predicting signatures. Pathway enrichment analyses were performed to uncover potential mechanisms. RESULTS Three miRNAs (miR-153, miR-212, and miR-591) independently related to the OS were extracted to build a risk score formula. The ROC curve and K-M analyses revealed good discrimination ability of the OS signature for osteosarcoma patients in both the training cohort (P=0.00015, AUC=0.962) and the validation cohort (P=0.0065, AUC=0.793). As shown in multivariate analysis, the classifier showed favorable predictive accuracy similar to the recurrence status to be an independent risk factor for osteosarcoma. Furthermore, the nomogram showed a synergistic effect by combining the clinicopathological features with our classifier. Also, the enrichment analyses of the target genes may contribute to improved treatment of osteosarcoma.

A Comparative Study on Machine Learning Approaches to Thunderstorm Gale Identification,"In this paper, we make a comparative study to examine the performance of different machine learning approaches for the thunderstorm gale identification. To this end, a thunderstorm gale benchmark dataset is constructed, which comprises radar images in Guangdong from 2015 to 2017. The corresponding wind velocities recorded by the automatic meteorological observation stations are utilized to offer the ground-truth. Based on the dataset, we evaluate the performance of Decision Tree Regressor (DT), Linear Regression (LR), Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Random Forest Regressor (RFR), K-nearest Neighbor Regressor (KNNR), Bayesian Ridge Regressor (BR), Adaboost Regressor (AR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Ten important features are extracted to apply these approaches, except CNN, which include radar echo intensity, radar reflectivity factor, radar combined reflectivity, vertical integrated liquid, echo tops and their changes with respect to (w.r.t.) time. Experimental results demonstrate the machine learning approaches can effectively identify the thunderstorm gale, and the CNN model performs the best. Finally, a thunderstorm system is developed based on CNN model, which help meteorologists to identify thunderstorm gales in terms of radar images.",2019,
Application of Machine Learning Models for Survival Prognosis in Breast Cancer Studies,"The application of machine learning models for prediction and prognosis of disease development has become an irrevocable part of cancer studies aimed at improving the subsequent therapy and management of patients. The application of machine learning models for accurate prediction of survival time in breast cancer on the basis of clinical data is the main objective of the presented study. The paper discusses an approach to the problem in which the main factor used to predict survival time is the originally developed tumor-integrated clinical feature, which combines tumor stage, tumor size, and age at diagnosis. Two datasets from corresponding breast cancer studies are united by applying a data integration approach based on horizontal and vertical integration by using proper document-oriented and graph databases which show good performance and no data losses. Aside from data normalization and classification, the applied machine learning methods provide promising results in terms of accuracy of survival time prediction. The analysis of our experiments shows an advantage of the linear Support Vector Regression, Lasso regression, Kernel Ridge regression, K-neighborhood regression, and Decision Tree regressionâ€”these models achieve most accurate survival prognosis results. The cross-validation for accuracy demonstrates best performance of the same models on the studied breast cancer data. As a support for the proposed approach, a Python-based workflow has been developed and the plans for its further improvement are finally discussed in the paper.",2019,Information
Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (DSM-5) Predicts Dropout in Inpatient Psychotherapy for Patients With Personality Disorder,"Objective
Criterion A serves as the fundamental diagnostic criterion of the Alternative Model of Personality Disorders in section III of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5. Consisting of a self- and an interpersonal dimension, it defines the construct of personality functioning as a general and dimensional factor of personality disorders. This study aimed to explore criterion A along with well-established treatment dropout predictors, e.g., sociodemographic factors, personality disorder diagnosis, symptom severity, and the therapeutic alliance.


Methods
The sample consisted of 132 patients diagnosed with personality disorder in a psychotherapeutic inpatient treatment. Cox proportional hazard regression models and a lasso model were applied.


Results
28% of the sample prematurely discontinued treatment. The risk for dropout was 2.3 times higher for patients with high impairments in self-functioning as assessed with criterion A. Moreover, a positive therapist-rated therapeutic alliance was associated with a lower dropout risk.


Conclusion
The study suggests criterion A is a useful clinical indicator by identifying patients with personality disorder with a higher risk for dropout. An individualized therapeutic approach for such patients might be required.",2019,Frontiers in Psychology
Comparing Time-Varying Price Impact and Information Impounding Time Across Asian Stock Exchanges: An Adaptive Lasso Approach,"In this paper we construct a parsimonious vector autoregression model with durations, trades and quote revisions to compare price impact and information impounding time in four Asian stock exchanges. We conduct simultaneous model selection and estimation using the adaptive lasso approach. We measure the price impact and the information impounding time via examining the impulse response of a new trade. Weekly estimation from January 2007 to August 2012 allows us to compare the time-varying price impacts. We find that the price impact and the information impounding time vary considerably across time. Traders in Korean and Japanese markets pay more attention to high price impact trades while traders in Hong Kong and Chinese markets pay less attention. Larger mean price impact has larger impact uncertainty measured by the price impactâ€™s standard deviation. Longer mean information impounding time has higher convergence uncertainty measured by the information impounding timeâ€™s standard deviation. For many stocks, price impacts have spikes during the 2008 financial crisis. The price impact is negatively related to liquidity and positively related to systematic risk. The average correlation among price impacts of different stocks also varies across time. In Korean and Chinese markets, when systematic risk is high, the average correlation among price impacts is also high.",2012,
Flexible Bayesian Quantile Regression with Lasso Penalty ( FBLQR ),"The selection of predictors plays a crucial role in building a multiple regression model. Indeed, the choice of a suitable subset of predictors can help to improve prediction accuracy and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a flexible Bayesian Lasso and adaptive Lasso quantile regression by introducing a hierarchical model framework approach to enable exact inference and shrinkage of an unimportant coefficient to zero. The error distribution is assumed to be an infinite mixture of Gaussian densities. We have theoretically investigated and numerically compared our proposed methods with Flexible Bayesian quantile regression (FBQR), Lasso quantile regression (LQR) and quantile regression (QR) methods. Simulations and real data studies are conducted under different settings to assess the performance of the proposed methods. The proposed methods perform well in comparison to the other methods in terms of median mean squared error, mean and variance of the absolute correlation criterions. We believe that the proposed methods are useful practically.",2013,
Some Worked-Out Examples,"The sharp oracle inequalities for the Lasso, the square-root Lasso and other structured sparsity estimators are completed with a probability statement saying the result holds with confidence at least 1 âˆ’Î± (say), with Î± > 0 a fixed error level. Also a sharp oracle inequality for projection estimators of a density are given. As a â€œrepresentativeâ€ example for the case of non-linear M-estimation with an l1-penalty, a sharp oracle inequality is presented for logistic regression. For trace regression with nuclear norm penalty, a sharp oracle is given when least squares loss is used, and a non-sharp one when least absolute deviations loss is used. In the latter case, the design is taken as in the matrix completion problem. As final example sparse principal component analysis is addressed.",2016,
