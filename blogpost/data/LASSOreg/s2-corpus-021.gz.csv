Model-assisted calibration of non-probability sample survey data using adaptive LASSO,"The probability-sampling-based framework has dominated survey research because it provides precise mathematical tools to assess sampling variability. However increasing costs and declining response rates are expanding the use of non-probability samples, particularly in general population settings, where samples of individuals pulled from web surveys are becoming increasingly cheap and easy to access. But non-probability samples are at risk for selection bias due to differential access, degrees of interest, and other factors. Calibration to known statistical totals in the population provide a means of potentially diminishing the effect of selection bias in non-probability samples. Here we show that model calibration using adaptive LASSO can yield a consistent estimator of a population total as long as a subset of the true predictors is included in the prediction model, thus allowing large numbers of possible covariates to be included without risk of overfitting. We show that the model calibration using adaptive LASSO provides improved estimation with respect to mean square error relative to standard competitors such as generalized regression (GREG) estimators when a large number of covariates are required to determine the true model, with effectively no loss in efficiency over GREG when smaller models will suffice. We also derive closed form variance estimators of population totals, and compare their behavior with bootstrap estimators. We conclude with a real world example using data from the National Health Interview Survey.",2018,
Clinical Pharmacogenetic Models of Treatment Response to Methotrexate Monotherapy in Slovenian and Serbian Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: Differences in Patient's Management May Preclude Generalization of the Models,"Objectives: Methotrexate (MTX) is the first line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but nevertheless 30% of patients experience MTX inefficacy. Our aim was to develop a clinical pharmacogenetic model to predict which RA patients will not respond to MTX monotherapy. We also assessed whether this model can be generalized to other populations by validating it on a group of Serbian RA patients. Methods: In 110 RA Slovenian patients, data on clinical factors and 34 polymorphisms in MTX pathway were analyzed by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized regression to select variables associated with the disease activity as measured by Disease Activity Score (DAS28) score after 6 months of MTX monotherapy. A clinical pharmacogenetic index was constructed from penalized regression coefficients with absolute value above 0.05. This index was cross-validated and also independently validated on 133 Serbian RA patients. Results: A clinical pharmacogenetic index for prediction of DAS28 after 6 months of MTX monotherapy in Slovenian RA patients consisted of DAS28 score at diagnosis, presence of erosions, MTX dose, Solute Carrier Family 19 Member 1 (SLC19A1) rs1051266, Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) rs2306283, Thymidylate Synthase (TYMS), and Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase 1 (AMPD1) rs17602729. It correctly classified 69% of Slovenian patients as responders or nonresponders and explained 30% of variability in DAS28 after 6 months of MTX monotherapy. Testing for validity in another population showed that it classified correctly only 22.5% of Serbian RA patients. Conclusions: We developed a clinical pharmacogenetic model for DAS28 after 6 months of MTX monotherapy in Slovenian RA patients by combining clinical and genetic variables. The clinical pharmacogenetic index developed for Slovenian patients did not perform well on Serbian patients, presumably due to the differences in patients' characteristics and clinical management between the two groups.",2018,Frontiers in Pharmacology
Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent.,"We develop fast algorithms for estimation of generalized linear models with convex penalties. The models include linear regression, two-class logistic regression, and multinomial regression problems while the penalties include â„“(1) (the lasso), â„“(2) (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.",2010,Journal of statistical software
Multiplex screening of 275 plasma protein biomarkers to identify a signature for early detection of colorectal cancer,"Blood-based protein biomarkers may be an attractive option for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we used a two-stage design to measure 275 protein markers by proximity extension assay (PEA), first in plasma samples of a discovery set consisting of 98 newly diagnosed CRC cases and 100 age and gender matched controls free of neoplasm at screening colonoscopy. An algorithm predicting the presence of early or late stage CRC was derived by Lasso regression with .632+ bootstrap method and the algorithms were then validated using PEA again in an independent validation set consisting of participants of screening colonoscopy with and without CRC (n= 56 and 102, respectively). Three different signatures for all, early, and late stages CRC consisting of 9, 12, and 11 protein markers were obtained in the discovery set with areas under the curves (AUCs) after .632+ bootstrap adjustment of 0.92, 0.91 and 0.96, respectively. External validation among participants of screening colonoscopy yielded AUCs of 0.76 (95%CI, 0.67-0.84), 0.75 (95%CI, 0.62-0.87) and 0.80 (95%CI, 0.68-0.89) for all, early, and late stage CRC, respectively. Although the identified protein markers are not competitive with the best available stool tests, these proteins may contribute to the development of powerful blood-based tests for CRC early detection in the future.",2019,Molecular Oncology
Regression Networks for Robust Win-Rates Predictions of AI Gaming Bots,"Designing a robust and adaptable Artificial Intelligence (AI) opponent in a computer game would ensure the game continues to challenge, immerse and excite the players at any stage. The outcomes of card based games such as â€œHeartstone: Heroes of Warcraftâ€, aside the player skills, heavily depend on the initial composition of player card decks. To evaluate this impact we have developed a new robust regression network in a context of the AAIA Data Mining Competition 2018, which tries to predict the average win-rates of the specific combinations of bot-player and card decks. Our network is composed of 2 levels: the entry level with an array of finely optimized state of the art regression models including Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), Extreme Gradient Boosted decision tree (XGBOOST), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression trained via supervised learning on the labeled training dataset; and just a single ELM at the 2nd level installed to learn to correct the predictions from the 1st level. The final solution received the root of the mean squared error (RMSE) of just 5.65% and scored the 2nd place in AAIA'2018 competition. This paper also presents two other runner-up models receiving RMSE of 5.7% and 5.86%, scoring the 4th and the 6th place respectively.",2018,2018 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)
Asymmetric volatility spillovers between UK regional worker flows and vacancies,"This paper investigates volatility spillovers between UK regional job finding, job separation and vacancy rates. Employing a logistic smooth transition vector autoregression (VAR) to model the large nonlinear dynamic system, we use the methods of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) to decompose the forecast error variances. Our approach is Bayesian. More specifically, we extend doubly adaptive elastic-net Lasso (DAELasso) methods for VAR parameter shrinkage into a nonlinear framework to allow for the possible regime changes. We find that for each variable, both the volatility spillovers to and from other variables are high, providing clear evidence for the close interdependence between UK regional labour markets. The pivotal role of London in generating and spreading changes in volatility is highlighted. Analysis of net spillovers shows that, in general, shocks to job separation rates tend to spread into job finding and vacancy rates. By contrast, vacancy rates are usually at the receiving ends of shocks transmitted from the job separation and finding rates. We further examine the shock propagation mechanism in more detail, such as the differences in spillovers between regions within the same regime, and that of the same region but in different regimes. Finally, we draw inferences that are of economic and policy importance.",2017,Applied Economics
Genomics and Prognosis Analysis of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Glioma,"Background: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is regulated by induction factors, transcription factor families and an array of signaling pathways genes, and has been implicated in the invasion and progression of gliomas. Methods: We obtained the Clinicopathological data sets from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). The â€œlimmaâ€ package was used to analyze the expression of EMT-related genes in gliomas with different pathological characteristics. We used the â€œConsensusClusterPlusâ€ package to divide gliomas into two groups to study their correlation with glioma malignancy. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was applied to select seven prognosis-associated genes to build the risk signature, and the coefficients obtained from the LASSO algorithm were used to calculate the risk score which we applied to determine the prognostic value of the risk signature. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine whether the risk signature is an independent prognostic indicator. Results: We analyzed the differentially expressed 22 common epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated genes in 508 gliomas graded by different clinicopathological features. Two glioma subgroups (EM1/2) were identified by consistent clustering of the proteins, of which the EM1 subgroup had a better prognosis than the EM2 subgroup, and the EM2 group was associated with cancer migration and proliferation. Significant enrichment analysis revealed that EMT-related transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways genes were highly related to glioma malignancies. Seven EMT-related genes were used to derive risk scores, which served as independent prognostic markers and prediction factors for the clinicopathological features of glioma. And we found the overall survival (OS) was significantly different between the low- and high-risk groups, the ROC curve indicated that the risk score can predict survival rates for glioma patients. Conclusion: EMT-related induction factors, transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways genes are important players in the malignant progression of glioma and may help in decision making regarding the choice of prognosis assessment and provide us clues to understand EMT epigenetic modification in glioma.",2020,Frontiers in Oncology

Taking Advantage of Sparsity in Multi-Task Learning,"We study the problem of estimating multiple linear regression equations for the purpose of both prediction and variable selection. Following recent work on multi-task learning Argyriou et al. [2008], we assume that the regression vectors share the same sparsity pattern. This means that the set of relevant predictor variables is the same across the different equations. This assumption leads us to consider the Group Lasso as a candidate estimation method. We show that this estimator enjoys nice sparsity oracle inequalities and variable selection properties. The results hold under a certain restricted eigenvalue condition and a coherence condition on the design matrix, which naturally extend recent work in Bickel et al. [2007], Lounici [2008]. In particular, in the multi-task learning scenario, in which the number of tasks can grow, we are able to remove completely the effect of the number of predictor variables in the bounds. Finally, we show how our results can be extended to more general noise distributions, of which we only require the variance to be finite.",2009,arXiv: Machine Learning
Predictive value of single-nucleotide polymorphism signature for recurrence in localised renal cell carcinoma: a retrospective analysis and multicentre validation study.,"BACKGROUND
Identification of high-risk localised renal cell carcinoma is key for the selection of patients for adjuvant treatment who are at truly higher risk of reccurrence. We developed a classifier based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to improve the predictive accuracy for renal cell carcinoma recurrence and investigated whether intratumour heterogeneity affected the precision of the classifier.


METHODS
In this retrospective analysis and multicentre validation study, we used paraffin-embedded specimens from the training set of 227 patients from Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) with localised clear cell renal cell carcinoma to examine 44 potential recurrence-associated SNPs, which were identified by exploratory bioinformatics analyses of a genome-wide association study from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) dataset (n=114, 906â€ˆ600 SNPs). We developed a six-SNP-based classifier by use of LASSO Cox regression, based on the association between SNP status and patients' recurrence-free survival. Intratumour heterogeneity was investigated from two other regions within the same tumours in the training set. The six-SNP-based classifier was validated in the internal testing set (n=226), the independent validation set (Chinese multicentre study; 428 patients treated between Jan 1, 2004 and Dec 31, 2012, at three hospitals in China), and TCGA set (441 retrospectively identified patients who underwent resection between 1998 and 2010 for localised clear cell renal cell carcinoma in the USA). The main outcome was recurrence-free survival; the secondary outcome was overall survival.


FINDINGS
Although intratumour heterogeneity was found in 48 (23%) of 206 cases in the internal testing set with complete SNP information, the predictive accuracy of the six-SNP-based classifier was similar in the three different regions of the training set (areas under the curve [AUC] at 5 years: 0Â·749 [95% CI 0Â·660-0Â·826] in region 1, 0Â·734 [0Â·651-0Â·814] in region 2, and 0Â·736 [0Â·649-0Â·824] in region 3). The six-SNP-based classifier precisely predicted recurrence-free survival of patients in three validation sets (hazard ratio [HR] 5Â·32 [95% CI 2Â·81-10Â·07] in the internal testing set, 5Â·39 [3Â·38-8Â·59] in the independent validation set, and 4Â·62 [2Â·48-8Â·61] in the TCGA set; all p<0Â·0001), independently of patient age or sex and tumour stage, grade, or necrosis. The classifier and the clinicopathological risk factors (tumour stage, grade, and necrosis) were combined to construct a nomogram, which had a predictive accuracy significantly higher than that of each variable alone (AUC at 5 years 0Â·811 [95% CI 0Â·756-0Â·861]).


INTERPRETATION
Our six-SNP-based classifier could be a practical and reliable predictor that can complement the existing staging system for prediction of localised renal cell carcinoma recurrence after surgery, which might enable physicians to make more informed treatment decisions about adjuvant therapy. Intratumour heterogeneity does not seem to hamper the accuracy of the six-SNP-based classifier as a reliable predictor of recurrence. The classifier has the potential to guide treatment decisions for patients at differing risks of recurrence.

Variable Selection and Shrinkage: Comparison of Some Approaches,"A common strategy within the framework of regression models is the selection of variables with possible predictive value, which are incorporated in the regression model. Two recently proposed methods, Breiman's Garotte (Breiman, 1995) and Tibshirani's Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) try to combine variable selection and shrinkage. We compare these with pure variable selection and shrinkage procedures. We consider the backward elimination procedure as a typical variable selection procedure and as an example of a shrinkage procedure an approach of Van Houwelingen and Le Cessie (1990). Additionally an extension of van Houwelingens and le Cessies approach proposed by Sauerbrei (1999) is considered. The ordinary least squares method is used as a reference. 
 
 
 
With the help of a simulation study we compare these approaches with respect to the distribution of the complexity of the selected model, the distribution of the shrinkage factors, selection bias, the bias and variance of the effect estimates and the average prediction error.",2001,Statistica Neerlandica
Predicting olivine composition using Raman spectroscopy through band shift and multivariate analyses,"Abstract Olivine group minerals are ubiquitous in extrusive igneous rocks and play an important role in constraining equilibria for samples in the upper mantle and above. All Raman spectra of the olivine group minerals in the solid solution between forsterite (Fo, Mg2SiO4) and fayalite (Fa, Fe2SiO4) have a high-intensity doublet between 800 and 880 cmâ€“1. Previous studies used small sample suites with limited compositional ranges and varying spectrometers to relate energy shifts of these two bands to Mg/Fe contents. In this work, Raman spectra of 93 olivine samples were acquired on either Brukerâ€™s 532 nm (laser wavelength) Senterra or BRAVO (785/852.3 nm) spectrometer. This paper compares the two-peak band shift univariate method with two multivariate methods: partial least squares (PLS) and the least absolute shrinkage operator (Lasso). Data sets from several instruments are also examined to assess the most accurate method for predicting olivine composition from a Raman spectrum. Our 181-spectra PLS model is recommended for use when determining olivine composition from a Raman spectrum. For Raman spectra of mixed phases where only the olivine doublet can be identified, composition can best be determined using the position of the peak ca. 838â€“857 cmâ€“1 through use of the regression equation %Fo = â€“0.179625x2 + 310.077x â€“133 717 (where x = DB2 centroid in units of cmâ€“1). In situ methods for predicting mineral composition on planetary surfaces are critically important to extraterrestrial exploration going forward; of these, Raman spectroscopy is likely the best, as shown by the impending deployment of several Raman instruments to Mars (ExoMars and Mars 2020). More broadly, application of machine learning methods to spectral data processing have implications to multiple fields that use spectroscopic data.",2017,American Mineralogist
Three Statistical Methods for the Social Sciences,"Social sciences offer particular challenges to statistics due to difficulties such as conducting randomized experiments in this domain, the large variation in humans, the difficulty in collecting complete datasets, and the typically unstructured nature of data at the human scale. New technology allows for increased computation and data recording, which has in turn brought forth new innovations for analysis.Because of these challenges and innovations, statistics in the social sciences is currently thriving and vibrant.This dissertation is an argument for evaluating statistical methodology in the social sciences along four major axes: \emph{validity}, \emph{interpretability}, \emph{transparency}, and \emph{employability}. We illustrate how one might develop methods that achieve these four goals with three case studies.The first is an analysis of post-stratification, a form of covariate adjustment to evaluate treatment effect. In contrast to recent results showing that regression adjustment can be problematic under the Neyman-Rubin model, we show post-stratification, something that can easily done in, e.g., natural experiments, has a similar precision to a randomized block trail as long as there are not too many strata. The difference is $O(1/n^2)$. Post-stratification thus potentially allows for transparently exploiting predictive covariates and random mechanisms in observational data. This case study illustrates the value of analyzing a simple estimator under weak assumptions, and of finding similarities between different methodological approaches so as to leverage earlier findings to a new domain.We then present a framework for building statistical tools to extract topic-specific key-phrase summaries of large text corpora (e.g., the New York Times) and a human validation experiment to determine best practices for this approach. These tools, built from high-dimensional, sparse classifiers such as L1-logistic regression and the Lasso, can be used to, for example, translate essential concepts across languages, investigate massive databases of aviation reports, or understand how different topics of interest are covered by various media outlets. This case study demonstrates how more modern methods can be evaluated using external validation in order to demonstrate that they produce meaningful and comprehendible results that can be broadly used.The third chapter presents the trinomial bound, a new auditing technique for elections rooted in very minimal assumptions. We demonstrated the usability of this technique by, in November 2008, auditing contests in Santa Cruz and Marin counties, California.The audits were risk-limiting, meaning they had a pre-specified minimum chance of requiring a full hand count if the outcomes were wrong. The trinomial bound gave better results than the Stringer bound, a tool common in accounting for analyzing financial audit samples drawn with probability proportional to an error bound. This case study focuses on generating methods that are employable and transparent so as to serve a public need.Throughout, we argue that, especially in the difficult domain of the social sciences, we must spend extra attention on the first axis of validity. This motivates our using the Neyman-Rubin model for the analysis of post-stratification, our developing an approach for external, model-independent validation for the key-phrase extraction tools, and our minimal assumptions for election auditing.",2012,
Predicting crack in a beam-like structure through an over fitting verified regression model,"The purpose of this paper is to identify the crack in beam-like structures before the complete failure or damage occurs to the structure. The beam-like structure plays an important role in modern architecture; hence, the safety of this structure is much dependent on the safety of the beam. Hence, predicting the cracks is much more important for the safety of the overall structure.,In the present work, the regression analysis has been carried out through LASSO and Ridge regression models. Both the statistical models have been well implemented in the detection of crack depth and crack location. A cantilever beam-like structure has been taken for the analysis in which the first three natural frequencies have been considered as the independent variable and crack location and depth is used as the dependent variable. The first three natural frequencies, f1, f2 and f3 are used as an independent variable. The crack location and crack depth are estimated though the regressor models and the accuracy are compared, to verify the correctness of the estimation.,As stated in the purpose of work, the main aim of the present work is to identify the crack parameters using an inverse technique, which will be more effective and will provide the results with less time. The data used for regression analysis are obtained from theoretical analysis and later the theoretical results are also verified through experimental analysis. The regression model developed is tested for its Bias Variance Trade-off (â€œBiasâ€ â€“ Overfitting, â€œvarianceâ€ â€“ generalization). The regression results have been compared with the theoretical results to check the robustness in the subsequent result section.,The idea is an amalgamation of existing and well-established technologies, that is aimed to achieve better performance for the given task. A regressor is trained from the data obtained through numerical simulation. The model is developed taking bias variance trade-off into consideration. This generalized model gives us very much acceptable performance.",2019,Multidiscipline Modeling in Materials and Structures
Regularization Paths for Conditional Logistic Regression: The clogitL1 Package.,"We apply the cyclic coordinate descent algorithm of Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2010) to the fitting of a conditional logistic regression model with lasso [Formula: see text] and elastic net penalties. The sequential strong rules of Tibshirani, Bien, Hastie, Friedman, Taylor, Simon, and Tibshirani (2012) are also used in the algorithm and it is shown that these offer a considerable speed up over the standard coordinate descent algorithm with warm starts. Once implemented, the algorithm is used in simulation studies to compare the variable selection and prediction performance of the conditional logistic regression model against that of its unconditional (standard) counterpart. We find that the conditional model performs admirably on datasets drawn from a suitable conditional distribution, outperforming its unconditional counterpart at variable selection. The conditional model is also fit to a small real world dataset, demonstrating how we obtain regularization paths for the parameters of the model and how we apply cross validation for this method where natural unconditional prediction rules are hard to come by.",2014,Journal of statistical software
A Grouped Structure-based Regularized Regression Model for Text Categorization,"The lasso regularization has successfully been used in regression models for feature selection; however, lasso considers all variable to be independent and noncorrelative, which will yield an excessively sparse solution (i.e., some important discriminating features might be discarded) if the features are highly correlated. This paper proposes a novel approach in which a sparse model was developed for text categorization. We firstly constructed a grouped structure according the correlation of text features, and then embedded the structure into a regression model via a between- and within- group sparse manner. The goal of such manner is that the groups containing many discriminating features can be selected even the features in these groups are highly correlated, and the noise within the selected groups could be discarded simultaneously, which is beneficial for classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a good tradeoff between performance and sparsity on three benchmark data sets.",2012,JSW
Profiling of 179 miRNA Expression in Blood Plasma of Lung Cancer Patients and Cancer-Free Individuals,"Lung cancer is one of major cancers, and survival of lung cancer patients is dictated by the timely detection and diagnosis. Cell-free circulating miRNAs were proposed as candidate biomarkers for lung cancer. These RNAs are frequently deregulated in lung cancer and can persist in bodily fluids for extended periods of time, shielded from degradation by membrane vesicles and biopolymer complexes. To date, several groups reported the presence of lung tumour-specific subsets of miRNAs in blood. Here we describe the profiling of blood plasma miRNAs in lung cancer patients, healthy individuals and endobronchitis patients using miRCURY LNA miRNA qPCR Serum/Plasma Panel (Exiqon). From 241 ratios differently expressed between cancer patients and healthy individuals 19 miRNAs were selected for verification using the same platform. LASSO-penalized logistic regression model, including 10 miRNA ratios comprised of 14 individual miRNAs discriminated lung cancer patients from both control groups with AUC of 0.979.",2018,Scientific Reports
Addressing the challenge of health measurement,"Assessing the health of populations is important for various reasons, especially for health policy purposes. Therefore, there exists a substantial need for health comparisons between populations, including the comparison of individuals, groups of persons, or even populations from different countries, at one point in time and over time. 
Two fundamentally different approaches exist to assess the health of populations. The first approach relies on indirect measures of health, which are based on mortality and morbidity statistics, and which are therefore only available at the population level. The second approach relies on direct measures of health, which are collected â€“ based on health surveys â€“ at the individual level. 
Based on the needs for comparisons, indirect measures appear to be less appropriate, as they are only available at the population level, but not at the individual or group level. Direct measures, however, are originally obtained at the individual level, and can then be aggregated to any group level, even to the population level. Therefore, direct measures seem to be more appropriate for these comparison purposes. 
The open question is then how to compare overall health based on data collected within health surveys. At first glance, a single general health question seems to be appealing. However, studies have shown that this kind of question is not appropriate to compare health over time, nor across populations. Qualitative studies found that respondents even consider very different aspects of health when responding to such a question. 
A more appropriate approach seems to be the use of data on several domains of health, as for example mobility, self-care and pain. Anyway, measuring health based on a set of domains is an extremely frequent approach. It provides more comprehensive information and can therefore be used for a wider range of possible applications. 
However, three open questions must be addressed when measuring health based on a set of domains. First, a parsimonious set of domains must be selected. Second, health measurement based on this set of domains must be operationalized in a standardized way. Third, this information must be aggregated into a summary measure of health, thereby taking into account that categorical responses to survey questions could be differently interpreted by respondents, and are not necessarily directly comparable. These open questions are addressed in this doctoral thesis. 
The overall objective of this doctoral thesis is to develop a valid, reliable and sensitive metric of health â€“ based on data collected on a set of domains â€“ that permits to monitor the health of populations over time, and which provides the basis for the comparisons of health across different populations. To achieve this aim two psychometric studies were carried out, entitled â€œTowards a Minimal Generic Set of Domainsâ€ and â€œDevelopment of a metric of healthâ€. 
In the first study a minimal generic set of domains suitable for measuring health both in the general population and in clinical populations was identified, and contrasted to the domains of the World Health Survey (WHS). 
The eight domains of the WHS â€“ mobility, self-care, pain and discomfort, cognition, interpersonal activities, vision, sleep and energy, and affect â€“ were used as a reference, as this set â€“ developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) â€“ so far constitutes the most advanced proposal of what to measure for international health comparisons. 
To propose the domains for the minimal generic set, two different regression methodologies â€“ Random Forest and Group Lasso â€“ were applied for the sake of robustness to three different data sources, two national general population surveys and one large international clinical study: the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998, the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007/2008, and the ICF Core Set studies. A domain was selected when it was sufficiently explanatory for self-perceived health. 
Based on the analyses the following set of domains, systematically named based on their respective categories within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), was proposed as a minimal generic set: 
b130 Energy and drive functions 
b152 Emotional functions 
b280 Sensation of pain 
d230 Carrying out daily routine 
d450 Walking 
d455 Moving around 
d850 Remunerative employment 
Based on this set, four of the eight domains of the WHS were confirmed both in the general and in clinical populations: mobility, pain and discomfort, sleep and energy, and affect. The other WHS domains not represented in the proposed minimal generic set are vision, which was only confirmed with data of the general population, self-care and interpersonal activities, which were only confirmed with data of the clinical population and cognition, which could not be confirmed at all. 
The ICF categories of `carrying out daily routineÂ´ and `remunerative employmentÂ´ also fulfilled the inclusion criteria, though not directly related to any of the eight WHS domains. 
This minimal generic set can be used as the starting point to address one of the most important challenges in health measurement, namely the comparability of data across studies and countries. It also represents the first step for developing a common metric of health to link information from the general population to information about sub-populations, such as clinical and institutional populations, e.g. persons living in nursing homes. 
In the second study a sound psychometric measure was developed based on information collected on the domains of the minimal generic set: energy and drive functions, emotional functions, sensation of pain, carrying out daily routine, mobility and remunerative employment. It was demonstrated that this metric can be used to assess the health of populations and also to monitor health over time. 
To develop this metric of health, data from two successive waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) was used. A specific Item Response Theory (IRT) model, the Partial Credit Model (PCM), was applied on 12 items representing the 6 domains from the minimal generic set. All three IRT model assumptions â€“ unidimensionality, local independency and monotonicity â€“ were examined and found to be fulfilled. 
The developed metric showed sound psychometric properties: high internal consistency reliability, high construct validity and high sensitivity to change. Therefore, it can be considered an appropriate measure of population health. 
Furthermore, it was demonstrated how the health of populations can be compared based on this metric, for subgroups of populations, and over time. Finally, it was outlined how this metric can be used as the basis for comparing health across different populations, as for example from two different countries. 
The developed health metric can be seen as the starting point for a wide range of health comparisons, between individuals, groups of persons and populations as a whole, and both at one point in time and over time. It opens up a wide range of possible applications for both health care providers and health policy, and both in clinical settings and in the general population.",2014,
Fused lasso with the adaptation of parameter ordering in combining multiple studies with repeated measurements.,"Combining multiple studies is frequently undertaken in biomedical research to increase sample sizes for statistical power improvement. We consider the marginal model for the regression analysis of repeated measurements collected in several similar studies with potentially different variances and correlation structures. It is of great importance to examine whether there exist common parameters across study-specific marginal models so that simpler models, sensible interpretations, and meaningful efficiency gain can be obtained. Combining multiple studies via the classical means of hypothesis testing involves a large number of simultaneous tests for all possible subsets of common regression parameters, in which it results in unduly large degrees of freedom and low statistical power. We develop a new method of fused lasso with the adaptation of parameter ordering (FLAPO) to scrutinize only adjacent-pair parameter differences, leading to a substantial reduction for the number of involved constraints. Our method enjoys the oracle properties as does the full fused lasso based on all pairwise parameter differences. We show that FLAPO gives estimators with smaller error bounds and better finite sample performance than the full fused lasso. We also establish a regularized inference procedure based on bias-corrected FLAPO. We illustrate our method through both simulation studies and an analysis of HIV surveillance data collected over five geographic regions in China, in which the presence or absence of common covariate effects is reflective to relative effectiveness of regional policies on HIV control and prevention.",2016,Biometrics
Analysis of Network Lasso For Semi-Supervised Regression,"We characterize the statistical properties of network Lasso for semi-supervised regression problems involving network- structured data. This characterization is based on the con- nectivity properties of the empirical graph which encodes the similarities between individual data points. Loosely speaking, network Lasso is accurate if the available label informa- tion is well connected with the boundaries between clusters of the network-structure datasets. We make this property precise using the notion of network flows. In particular, the existence of a sufficiently large network flow over the empirical graph implies a network compatibility condition which, in turn, en- sures accuracy of network Lasso.",2019,ArXiv
Joint estimation of $K$ related regression models with simple $L_1$-norm penalties,"We propose a new approach, along with refinements, based on $L_1$ penalties and aimed at jointly estimating several related regression models. Its main interest is that it can be rewritten as a weighted lasso on a simple transformation of the original data set. In particular, it does not need new dedicated algorithms and is ready to implement under a variety of regression models, {\em e.g.}, using standard R packages. Moreover, asymptotic oracle properties are derived along with preliminary non-asymptotic results, suggesting good theoretical properties. Our approach is further compared with state-of-the-art competitors under various settings on synthetic data: these empirical results confirm that our approach performs at least similarly to its competitors. As a final illustration, an analysis of road safety data is provided.",2014,arXiv: Methodology
"Distinct subsets of non-coding RNAs are strongly associated with BMD and fracture, studied in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing human bone.","We investigated mechanisms resulting in low bone mineral density (BMD) and susceptibility to fracture by comparing non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in biopsies of non-weight-bearing (NWB) iliac (nÂ =Â 84) and weight bearing (WB) femoral (nÂ =Â 18) postmenopausal bone across BMDs varying from normal (T-scoreâ€‰>â€‰-1.0) to osteoporotic (T-scoreâ€‰â‰¤â€‰-2.5). Global bone ncRNA concentrations were determined by PCR and microchip analyses. Association with BMD or fracture, adjusted by age and body mass index, were calculated using linear and logistic regression and Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) analysis. At 10% false discovery rate (FDR), 75 iliac bone ncRNAs and 94 femoral bone ncRNAs, were associated with total hip BMD. Eight of the ncRNAs were common for the two sites, but five of them (miR-484, miR-328-3p, miR-27a-5p, miR-28-3p, and miR-409-3p) correlated positively to BMD in femoral bone, but negatively in iliac bone. Of predicted pathways recognized in bone metabolism, ECM-receptor interaction and Proteoglycans in cancer emerged at both sites, while e.g. Fatty acid metabolism and Focal adhesion were only identified in iliac bone. Lasso analysis and cross-validations identified sets of nine bone ncRNAs correlating strongly with adjusted total hip BMD in both femoral and iliac bone. Twenty-eight iliac ncRNAs were associated with risk of fracture (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.1). The Small Nucleolar RNAs, RNU44 and RNU48, have a function in stabilization of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and their association with fracture and BMD suggest that aberrant processing of rRNAs may be involved in development of osteoporosis. Cis-eQTL analysis of the iliac bone biopsies identified two loci associated with miRNAs, one previously identified in a heel-BMD genome-wide association study (GWAS). In this comprehensive investigation of the skeletal genetic background in post-menopausal women, we identified functional bone ncRNAs associated to fracture and BMD, representing distinct subsets in WB and NWB skeletal sites.

The Effect of Active Surveillance on Reducing Methicillin- Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (mrsa) Bacteremia Rates within the Scripps Health Organization (2007-2010),"OF THE THESIS The Effect of Active Surveillance on Reducing Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Bacteremia Rates within the Scripps Health Organization (2007-2010) by Lucia Pasqualina Camperlengo Master of Public Health San Diego State University, 2012 MRSA continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality among inpatients. Blood stream infections (BSIs) are one of the most serious nosocomial complications, are relatively easy to diagnose and are a marker for the spread of other resistant organisms between hospitalized patients. In 2008, a law (SB1058) was passed that directed hospitals towards active surveillance of MRSA in an attempt to decrease rates of transmission. The law states that hospitals must screen high risk patients for MRSA colonization within 24 hours of admission. This retrospective study aims to determine whether the rate of MRSA BSIs has significantly decreased within the Scripps Health Organization in conjunction with this legislation. Positive MRSA bacteremia cultures were collected from five Scripps campuses (2007-2010, N=427) and subsequently classified as hospitalor community-associated. Student T tests and Chi-square tests were used to determine statistical differences between pre-legislation and post-legislation rates. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors for MRSA infection. Analysis revealed that while overall there was a reduction in community-associated MRSA bacteremia rates, there was not a significant reduction in hospitalassociated MRSA bacteremia rates. These findings suggest that active surveillance of high risk patients has not clearly succeeded in reducing the nosocomial spread of MRSA but may help direct antibiotic choices for new hospital admissions and prevent the development of BSI in these patients. Results from this study may be useful to inform legislative action, as well as the development of more effective control interventions.",2012,
Lasso : Solusi Alternatif Seleksi Peubah Dan Penyusutan Koefisien Model Regresi Linier,"A new method, known as LASSO, has recently developed for selections and shrinkage linear regression methods. The method gives an alternative solution on high correlated data between independent variables, where the least squares produces high variance. Based on simulation this method is not better than forward selection (in the case the parameters contains many zero values) and ridge regression (in the case all parameter values close to zero). Unknowing the true parameter and consistency estimates for all conditions that put the LASSO is better than ridge or forward selection.

A Suggestive Model For Rice Yield Prediction And Ideal Meteorological Conditions During Crisis,"The agriculture sector is the backbone of Indian economy. Seventy percent of population in India is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. With the available resources and infrastructure villagers are able to produce the crop not to the fullest potential yield. In order to augment the efforts of farmers to get higher yields a predictive model was developed. This will help farmers by predicting the yield of the upcoming season by using machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as Deep Neural Network Regressor, Gaussian Process Regressor, Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. This can be done by understanding the relationship between factors that affect crop production (like area, seasonal monthly average temperature, seasonal monthly average humidity, seasonal monthly average rainfall, seasonal monthly average wind speed, seasonal monthly average UV index, seasonal monthly average sun hours, and seasonal monthly average pressure) and crop yield. Prediction will be performed on rice as it is one of the major crops produced in India. If the predicted values are substantially lower than the mean yield then by simulating the weather parameters maximum yield and profit can be obtained.",2019,International Journal of Scientific & Technology Research
"[Incidence, risk factors and management of pericardial effusion post radiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with atrial fibrillations].","OBJECTIVE
Pericardial effusion (PE) is a major complication of atrial fibrillation ablation (AFB). We analyzed the incidence, risk factors and managements of PE post AFB (radiofrequency catheter ablation).


METHODS
A total of 156 consecutive patients with AF [male 108, paroxysmal AF 114, (57.6 +/- 11.3) years], who underwent AFB guided by a three-dimensional mapping system (CARTO or CARTO-Merge, Biosense-Webster Inc., Diamond Bar, California) and a circular mapping catheter (Lasso, Biosense-Webster Inc., Diamond Bar, California), were included in this study. The ablation strategy included circumferential pulmonary veins isolation (CPVI), linear ablation and/or complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) ablation. Electrophysiological data and vital signs of patients were recorded by a multiple physiological recorder (Prucka, GE Medical Systems) during ablation. Ablation process, sites, duration and other related factors were also recorded. Echocardiography and other examinations were performed for diagnosing and monitoring PE.


RESULTS
CPVI were achieved in all 156 patients. Incidence of PE was 10.3% (16/156) post AFB. One patient developed acute cardiac tamponade and emergency drainage of the pericardial effusion was performed through a median sternotomy and patient recovered without complications during the 18 months follow-up. The rest 15 PE patients with small PE received outpatient care and no invasive treatment was needed and PE disappeared after 3 months in 6 patients and after 6 months in 9 patients. Univariate analysis showed that the composition of gender (P < 0.01), ablation in coronary sinus (CS, P = 0.026), ablation of CFAEs (P = 0.037) and superior vena cava (SVC, P = 0.041) were risk factors for PE. Logistic regression analysis showed that female gender [beta = 3.594, exp (b) = 36.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.2 - 312.1, P = 0.001] and ablation in CS [beta = 2.419, exp (b) = 11.2, 95% CI: 1.0 - 124.6, P = 0.049] were independent risk factors for PE post AFB.


CONCLUSIONS
PE is a common complication of AFB, female gender and ablation in CS were independent risk factors for PE. Most PE patients experienced spontaneous recovery but emergency treatment was needed for patient with cardiac tamponade.",2008,Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi
Self-Assembling Insurance Claim Models Using Regularized Regression and Machine Learning,"The lasso is applied in an attempt to automate the loss reserving problem. The regression form contained within the lasso is a GLM, and so that the model has all the versatility of that type of model, but the model selection is automated and the parameter coefficients for selected terms will not be the same. 
There are two applications presented, one to synthetic data in conventional triangular form, and another to real data.The secret of success in such an endeavor is the selection of the set of candidate basis functions for representation of the data set. Cross-validation is used for model selection. 
The lasso performs well in modelling, identifying known features in the synthetic data, and tracking them accurately. This is despite complexity in those features that would challenge, and possibly defeat, most loss reserving alternatives. In the case of real data, the lasso also succeeds in tracking features of the data that analysis of the data set over many years has rendered virtually known. 
A later section of the paper discusses the prediction error associated with a lasso-based loss reserve. It is seen that the procedure can be readily adapted to the estimation of parameter and process error, but can also estimate one component of model error. To the authors knowledge, no other loss reserving model in the literature does so.",2018,
A gradient descending solution to the LASSO criteria,"In this paper, we propose a new perspective to achieve sparseness via the winner-take-all principle for the linear kernel regression and classification tasks. We form the duality of the LASSO criteria, and transfer an /spl lscr//sub 1/ norm minimization to an /spl lscr//sub /spl infin// norm maximization problem. We introduce a novel winner-take-all neural network solution derived from gradient descending, which links the sparse representation and the competitive learning scheme. This scheme is a form of unsupervised learning in which each input pattern comes through learning, to be associated with the activity of one or at most a few neurons. However, the lateral interaction between neurons in the same layer is strictly preemptive in this model. This framework is applicable to a variety of problems, such as independent component analysis (ICA), feature selection, and data clustering.",2005,"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005."
Group-sparse regression using the covariance fitting criterion,"A generalization of the covariance fitting criteria, for grouped variables, is presented.An hyperparameter-free analogue to the SPICE method is proposed for grouped variables, termed group-SPICE.The connection between group-SPICE and the group-LASSO (for both dense and sparse groups) is established.An efficient iterative implementation is presented for both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic noise.Group-SPICE is verified for synthetic data, as well as applied to the multi-pitch estimation problem. In this work, we present a novel formulation for efficient estimation of group-sparse regression problems. By relaxing a covariance fitting criteria commonly used in array signal processing, we derive a generalization of the recent SPICE method for grouped variables. Such a formulation circumvents cumbersome model order estimation, while being inherently hyperparameter-free. We derive an implementation which iteratively decomposes into a series of convex optimization problems, each being solvable in closed-form. Furthermore, we show the connection between the proposed estimator and the class of LASSO-type estimators, where a dictionary-dependent regularization level is inherently set by the covariance fitting criteria. We also show how the proposed estimator may be used to form group-sparse estimates for sparse groups, as well as validating its robustness against coherency in the dictionary, i.e., the case of overlapping dictionary groups. Numerical results show preferable estimation performance, on par with a group-LASSO bestowed with oracle regularization, and well exceeding comparable greedy estimation methods.",2017,Signal Process.
MSC-clustering and forward stepwise regression for virtual metrology in highly correlated input spaces,"Increasingly semiconductor manufacturers are exploring opportunities for virtual metrology (VM) enabled process monitoring and control as a means of reducing non-value added metrology and achieving ever more demanding wafer fabrication tolerances. However, developing robust, reliable and interpretable VM models can be very challenging due to the highly correlated input space often associated with the underpinning data sets. A particularly pertinent example is etch rate prediction of plasma etch processes from multichannel optical emission spectroscopy data. This paper proposes a novel input-clustering based forward stepwise regression methodology for VM model building in such highly correlated input spaces. Max Separation Clustering (MSC) is employed as a pre-processing step to identify a reduced srt of well-conditioned, representative variables that can then be used as inputs to state-of-the-art model building techniques such as Forward Selection Regression (FSR), Ridge regression, LASSO and Forward Selection Ridge Regression (FCRR). The methodology is validated on a benchmark semiconductor plasma etch dataset and the results obtained are compared with those achieved when the state-of-art approaches are applied directly to the data without the MSC pre-processing step. Significant performance improvements are observed when MSC is combined with FSR (13%) and FSRR (8.5%), but not with Ridge Regression (-1%) or LASSO (-32%). The optimal VM results are obtained using the MSC-FSR and MSC-FSRR generated models.",2012,2012 SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference
