Applying â€œLassoâ€ Regression to Predict Future Glaucomatous Visual Field Progression in the Central 10 Degrees,"Purpose of the Study: We recently reported that it is beneficial to apply least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression to predict future 24-2 visual field (VF) progression. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the usefulness of Lasso regression to predict VF progression in the central 10 degrees (10-2) in glaucoma patients. Methods: Series of 10 VFs (Humphrey Field Analyzer 10-2 SITA-standard) from each of 149 eyes in 110 open angle glaucoma patients, obtained over 5.7Â±1.4 years (meanÂ±SD) were investigated. Mean deviation values of the 10th VF were predicted using varying numbers of VFs (ranging from the first to third VFs to the first to ninth VFs), applying ordinary least square regression (OLSLR) and Lasso regression. Absolute prediction errors were then compared. Results: With OLSLR, prediction error varied between 5.4Â±5.0 (using first to third VFs) and 1.1Â±1.6 dB (using first to ninth VFs). Significantly smaller prediction errors were obtained with Lasso regression, in particular with small numbers of VFs (from 2.1Â±2.8: first to third VFs, to 1.0Â±1.6 dB: first to ninth VFs). A large &lgr; value, which is an index showing the degree of penalty in Lasso regression, was observed when a small number of VFs were used for prediction. Conclusion: Mean deviation prediction using OLSLR with a small number of VFs resulted in large prediction errors. It was useful to apply Lasso regression when predicting future progression of the central 10 degrees, compared to OLSLR.",2017,Journal of Glaucoma
Agribusiness Intelligence: Grape Production Forecast Using Data Mining Techniques,"The agribusiness volatility is related to the uncertainty of the environment, rising demand, falling prices and new technologies. However, generation of agriculture data has increased over past years and can be used for a growing number of applications of data mining techniques in agriculture. The multidisciplinary approach of integrating computer science with agriculture will support the necessary decisions to be taken in order to mitigate risks and maximize profits. The present study analyzes different methods of regression applied in the study case of grapes production forecast. The selected methods were multivariate linear regression, regression trees, lasso and random forest. Their performance were compared against the predictions obtained by the company through the mean squared error and the coefficient of variation. The four regression methods used obtained better predictive results than the method used by the company with statistical significance < 0.5%.",2018,
Correlates of Alcohol Consumption and Drug Injection among Homeless Youth: A Case Study in the Southeast of Iran,"Background
Alcohol use and drug injection are prevalent among homeless youths. The aim of this study was to identify the associated factors of alcohol consumption and drug injection among homeless youths aged 18-29 years.


Methods
Data on 202 homeless youths (111 males and 91 females) were collected using a standardized questionnaire and face-to-face interview. Lasso logistic regression was applied to determine the impact of associated factors on alcohol consumption and drug injection.


Findings
The mean age of the participants was 26.30 Â± 3.19 years. Also, the prevalence of alcohol consumption and drug injection was 33.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 30-36] and 4.0% (95% CI: 0-8), respectively; 6 people (3.0%) consumed alcohol and injected drugs at the same time. Correlates of alcohol consumption and drug injection were male sex [odds ratio (OR)Alc = 5.7], age (ORAlc = 0.96 and ORDI = 0.98), bachelor or higher education level (ORAlc = 1.34), non-Iranian nationality (ORAlc = 0.05 and ORDI = 0.18), food score (ORDI = 0.92), smoking (ORAlc = 2.05), substance use (ORAlc = 1.12), opposite sex relationship (ORAlc = 1.6), homosexual relationship (ORAlc = 3.56 and ORDI = 2.69), and mental disorder (ORAlc = 0.99).


Conclusion
Based on our findings, it seems that the homeless youth are more desired to use alcohol and drug injection, whereas the prevalence of alcohol consumption and drug injection in homeless youth was higher than general youth population in Iran. Therefore, some suitable solutions are needed to prevent the homelessness. Also, the effective variables that were identified in this study for alcohol use and drug injection can help design and implement beneficial interventions.",2019,Addiction & Health
Overexpression of kinesin superfamily members as prognostic biomarkers of breast cancer,"Kinesin superfamily (KIFs) has a long-reported significant influence on the initiation, development, and progress of breast cancer. However, the prognostic value of whole family members was poorly done. Our study intends to demonstrate the value of kinesin superfamily members as prognostic biomarkers as well as a therapeutic target of breast cancer. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were done using data from TCGA, GEO, METABRIC, and GTEx. LASSO regression was done to select tumor-related members. Nomogram was constructed to predict the overall survival (OS) of breast cancer patients. Expression profiles were testified by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Transcription factor, GO and KEGG enrichments were done to explore regulatory mechanism and functions. A total of 20 differentially expressed KIFs were identified between breast cancer and normal tissue with 4 (KIF17, KIF26A, KIF7, KIFC3) downregulated and 16 (KIF10, KIF11, KIF14, KIF15, KIF18A, KIF18B, KIF20A, KIF20B, KIF22, KIF23, KIF24, KIF26B, KIF2C, KIF3B, KIF4A, KIFC1) overexpressed. Among which, 11 overexpressed KIFs (KIF10, KIF11, KIF14, KIF15, KIF18A, KIF18B, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C, KIF4A, KIFC1) significantly correlated with worse OS, relapse-free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of breast cancer. A 6-KIFs-based risk score (KIF10, KIF15, KIF18A, KIF18B, KIF20A, KIF4A) was generated by LASSO regression with a nomogram validated an accurate predictive efficacy. Both mRNA and protein expression of KIFs are experimentally demonstrated upregulated in breast cancer patients. Msh Homeobox 1 (MSX1) was identified as transcription factors of KIFs in breast cancer. GO and KEGG enrichments revealed functions and pathways affected in breast cancer. Overexpression of tumor-related KIFs correlate with worse outcomes of breast cancer patients and can work as potential prognostic biomarkers.",2020,Cancer Cell International
Construction of accurate machine learning force fields for copper and silicon dioxide.,"Recently, the machine learning force field has emerged as a powerful atomic simulation approach for its high accuracy and low computational cost. However, its applications in the multi-component materials are relatively less. In this study, the ML force fields are constructed for both elemental material (Cu) and binary material (SiO2). The atomic environments are described by the structural fingerprint that takes the bond angle into account, and then, different ML techniques, including linear regression, neural network and mixture model method, are used to learn the structure-force relationship. We found that the use of angular structural fingerprint and mixture model method significantly improves the accuracy of ML force fields. In addition, we discussed the effective structural fingerprints auto-selection method based on LASSO and the genetic algorithm. The atomic simulations carried out with ML force fields are in excellent agreement with ab initio calculations.",2018,arXiv: Materials Science
Gender and sex independently associate with common somatic symptoms and lifetime prevalence of chronic disease.,"Sex and gender influence health differently. Associations between sex and health have been extensively studied, but gender (i.e. psychosocial sex) has been largely neglected, partly due to the absence of gender measures in cohort studies. Therefore, our objective was to test the unique associations of gender and sex with common somatic symptoms and chronic diseases, using a gender index created from existing cohort data. We applied LASSO logistic regression to identify, out of 153 unique variables, psychosocial variables that were predictive of sex (i.e. gender-related) in the Dutch LifeLines Cohort Study. These psychosocial variables covered gender roles and institutionalized gender. Using the estimated coefficients, gender indexes were calculated for each adult participant in the study (nÂ =Â 152,728; 58.5% female; mean age 44.6 (13.1) years). We applied multiple ordinal and logistic regression to test the unique associations of the gender index and sex, and their interactions, with common somatic symptoms assessed by the SCL-90 SOM and self-reported lifetime prevalence of chronic diseases, respectively. We found that in 10.1% of the participants the gender index was not in line with participants' sex: 12.5% of men and 8.4% of women showed a discrepancy between gender index and sex. Feminine gender characteristics are associated with increased common somatic symptoms and chronic diseases, especially in men. Female sex is associated with a higher common somatic symptom burden, but not with a higher prevalence of chronic diseases. The study shows that gender and sex uniquely impact health, and should be considered in epidemiological studies. Our methodology shows that consideration of gender measures in studies is necessary and feasible, based on data generally present in cohort studies.",2020,Social science & medicine
Essai d'interprÃ©tation des coupes du Quaternaire rÃ©cent de l'oued El Akarit (Sud Tunisien),"Les coupes de l'oued El Akarit ont une importance considerable pour expliquer l'evolution geomorphologique et paleoclimatique du Sud-Tunisien depuis 40 000 ans. La presente etude a permis de preciser la succession de deux sequences sedimentaires, separees par une discordance de ravinement deja mise en evidence par W.D. Page (1972). GrÃ¢ce a une collaboration pluridisciplinaire, les environnements successifs de ces deux sequences ont ete analyses en detail. La premiere, a la fin du Pleistocene superieur, debute par une periode relativement humide dont l'Ã¢ge reste incertain malgre les essais de datation au 14C et la presence de gisements ""mousteriens"". La microfaune, en particulier les Foraminiferes, indique des milieux a salinite variable, en rapport avec une transgression probable du milieu marin (vers 27 000 BP ?). Cette sequence s'acheve par une sedimentation gypseuse (assechement du climat) et un creusement de la vallee (regression marine ?). La seconde sequence commence aussi par des depots hydromorphes, encore plus caracteristiques de milieux euryhalins a affinites thalassoides d'apres la microfaune, les Mollusques et probablement la microflore. Cet episode est bien date, entre 8 700 et 7 400 BP. Ici aussi, les pollens indiquent un couvert de steppe dominant, avec un leger accroissement des arbres vers 6 500-6 000 BP, juste avant le depot generalise de poussieres de gypse et l'installation d'un regime de sebkha. Une legere reprise du ruissellement et le depot de loess marquent la fin de cette extreme aridite et le retour a une vegetation steppique autour de 3 500 BP. Depuis 2 ou 3 millenaires, alors que le niveau marin reste eleve, on assiste a un creusement tres rapide, de 8 a 19 m, le long de cette vallees. 
En plus de cette reconstitution paleoclimatique, cette etude remet en cause l'interpretation et la datation du glacis 2 - forme majeure des piedmonts du Sud-Tunisien - et surtout le postulat d'une stabilite tectonique du seuil d'Oudref, entre les chotts et le golfe de Gabes.",1983,
Efficient Regularized Regression for Variable Selection with L0 Penalty,"Variable (feature, gene, model, which we use interchangeably) selections for regression with high-dimensional BIGDATA have found many applications in bioinformatics, computational biology, image processing, and engineering. One appealing approach is the L0 regularized regression which penalizes the number of nonzero features in the model directly. L0 is known as the most essential sparsity measure and has nice theoretical properties, while the popular L1 regularization is only a best convex relaxation of L0. Therefore, it is natural to expect that L0 regularized regression performs better than LASSO. However, it is well-known that L0 optimization is NP-hard and computationally challenging. Instead of solving the L0 problems directly, most publications so far have tried to solve an approximation problem that closely resembles L0 regularization. 
In this paper, we propose an efficient EM algorithm (L0EM) that directly solves the L0 optimization problem. $L_0$EM is efficient with high dimensional data. It also provides a natural solution to all Lp p in [0,2] problems. The regularized parameter can be either determined through cross-validation or AIC and BIC. Theoretical properties of the L0-regularized estimator are given under mild conditions that permit the number of variables to be much larger than the sample size. We demonstrate our methods through simulation and high-dimensional genomic data. The results indicate that L0 has better performance than LASSO and L0 with AIC or BIC has similar performance as computationally intensive cross-validation. The proposed algorithms are efficient in identifying the non-zero variables with less-bias and selecting biologically important genes and pathways with high dimensional BIGDATA.",2014,ArXiv
Cross-sectional and longitudinal association between types of meniscal pathology and knee pain: Data from the osteoarthritis initiative,"s / Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 23 (2015) A82eA416 A277 434 CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TYPES OF MENISCAL PATHOLOGY AND KNEE PAIN: DATA FROM THE OSTEOARTHRITIS INITIATIVE B. Eathakkattu Antony yz, J. Driban y, L.L. Price y, G.H. Lo x, R.J. Ward y, C.B. Eaton k, C. Ding z, T.E. McAlindon y. y Tufts Med. Ctr., Boston, MA, USA; zMenzies Res. Inst. Tasmania, Hobart, Australia; xMichael E. DeBakey VA Med. Ctr. and Baylor Coll. of Med., Houston, TX, USA; kBrown Univ. Sch. of Med., Providence, RI, USA Purpose: Meniscal pathology increases the risk for the incidence and progression of knee osteoarthritis but is only weakly related to knee pain. However, the association of meniscal pathology with knee pain has primarily been analyzed based on the presence or absence of meniscal pathology, which does not account for the type of meniscal pathology. We hypothesize that certain types of meniscal pathology may relate to knee pain andmay predict change in knee pain. The aim of this study was to explore the association of different types of knee meniscal pathology with knee pain and change in knee pain over 2 years. Methods: We selected a convenience sample of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) who had complete data for the OAI Bone Ancillary Project. The right knee was selected as the index knee unless there was a contraindication for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. A single experienced fellowship trained musculoskeletal radiologist reviewed the 24-month OAI MR images for meniscal pathology by location (i.e., anterior, body, and posterior horn) within the medial and lateral menisci using a modified International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery, and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine (ISAKOS) meniscal tear classification system. For analyses, we reclassified the 10 original ISAKOS categories into 5 categories: normal, degenerative signal, morphological deformity, any tear (i.e., horizontal, horizontal flap, vertical-longitudinal, radial, radial-longitudinal, complex tear), and maceration. To replicate prior studies, we explored whether the presence or absence of any meniscal pathology in a knee was associated with pain. Total number of regions affected by meniscal pathology for each knee (0-6) was calculated by counting the number of regions that had pathologic findings. Knee pain was assessed using Western Ontario andMcMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scale at 24 and 48 months. Knee pain at 24 months was categorized into 3 categories: 1) no or little pain (WOMAC pain score 0 or 1), 2) mild pain (WOMAC pain score 2 or 3), 3) moderate-severe pain (WOMAC pain score > 3). Longitudinally, we categorized the change in pain into 3 categories based on the presence or absence of pain and a clinically meaningful change in pain (absolute change of 2 or relative change of 40%): 1) no pain or a meaningful decrease in pain (reference category), 2) pain but no change over time, and 3) meaningful increase in pain. Ordinal logistic regression was performed to determine the association of baseline meniscal pathology with knee pain and change in knee pain over 2 years. All models were adjusted for age, sex, and bodymass index (BMI). Results: 465 participants were included in the analysis with mean age of 63.2 (9.1) years, 53% male, mean BMI 29.5 (4.5) kg/m2, 71% KL grade >1â„42, and 86% with any type of meniscal pathology. Tables below show the associations of meniscal pathology with knee pain (Table 1) and change in knee pain (Table 2). There was no association between presence of any meniscal pathology with knee pain or change in knee pain. Having all six meniscal regions affected with any pathology was associated with greater pain (OR:2.65) compared to those with normal menisci. However, having more affected meniscal regions was not related to an increase in pain. This pattern persisted when the number of regions affected by maceration was analyzed cross-sectionally and longitudinally. When we assessed the types of meniscal pathology, cross-sectionally, the only significant associationwas betweenmeniscal maceration and greater knee pain (OR:2.89). Longitudinally, there was a significant association between morphological deformity (OR:1.46) and increase in knee pain over 2 years. Removing surgery or injury cases did not change our results. Conclusions: These results suggest that meniscal maceration is associated with higher knee pain that may not change over time. However, we hypothesize that morphological deformity may lead to maceration over time, which may explain why morphologic deformity is associated with an increased pain over time. Further prospective studies are warranted to determine if discrete tear incidence is related to acute knee pain and if a subset of knees can then function without pain.

Wang, Y. Feng, Q. Hua, W. Kramer, N. Barnthouse. Univ. of Kansas Med. Ctr., Kansas City, KS, USA Purpose: The risk of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) after joint injuries ranges from 20% to more than 50% evenwith the best current care of joint injuries. The risk of PTOA increases with age of patients, suggesting thatbiologic factorsmaybe involved in theprogressionof PTOA.However, the key biologic factors responsible for PTOA progression remain unclear. NFAT1 (NFATc2) is a member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors originally identified as a regulator of the expression of cytokine genes during the immune response. Our recent studies revealed that mice lacking NFAT1 exhibit normal skeletal development but display dysfunction of articular chondrocytes and OA-like changes in adults,withearlyosteoarthritic changes in the knee joints after 6-8months of age. This study aimed to test our hypothesis that the global NFAT1 expression level affects the time of onset and progression of knee PTOAafter surgical destabilizationof themedialmeniscus (DMM) inmice. Methods: We generated bilateral DMM by surgical transection of the medial meniscotibial ligament (MMTL) in 2 to 3-month-old Nfat1 knockout (Nfat1-/-), Nfat1Ã¾/-, and wild-type (WT) mice. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine. Under a surgical microscope, the knee joint was exposed through a medial parapatellar incision under sterile conditions. The MMTL was transected with micro-surgical scissors to destabilize the medial meniscus. For sham surgery, the MMTL was visualized but not transected. The joint capsule was closed with 8-0 resorbable Vicryl sutures and the skin incision closed with 5-0 non-resorbable sutures. Operated animals were allowed caged mobility after surgery and were monitored to ensure healthy recovery. Animals were euthanized at 4, 8, and 16 weeks after surgery. The knee joints were harvested and processed for histochemical and histomorphometric analyses to evaluate the severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Articular cartilage samples harvested from the medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau were processed for gene expression analyses by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Statistical analyses were performed with Student t-test and ANOVA. Results: Tissue sections stained with safranin-O and fast green were used for histomorphometric analyses to determine the severity of knee OA. We utilized a semi-quantitative OA grading scale as previously described (Glasson et al. Osteoarthritis Cartilage 2007; 15:1061). After the DMM surgery, Nfat1-/and Nfat1Ã¾/mice displayed earlier onset of OA and significantly more severe OA in the knee joints than WT mice. The osteoarthritic changes such as cartilage lesions and chondroosteophyte formation were more apparent on the medial side than the lateral side of the knee joint in all three groups. Nfat1-/-, Nfat1Ã¾/-, and WT mice receiving the sham surgery displayed focal loss of safranin-O staining in the articular cartilage of the knee joints at 4 and 8 weeks but recovered at 16 weeks without apparent osteoarthritic changes. qPCR analyses demonstrated that expression levels of Col10a1 (a marker of hypertrophic chondrocytes) and specific pro-inflammatory cytokines",2015,Osteoarthritis and Cartilage
Mining the Breast Cancer Proteome for Predictors of Drug Sensitivity,"Approximately 20 drugs have been approved by the FDA for breast cancer treatment, yet predictive biomarkers are known for only a few of these. The identification of additional biomarkers would be useful both for drugs currently approved for breast cancer treatment and for new drug development. Using glycoprotein expression data collected via mass spectrometry, in conjunction with statistical models constructed by elastic net or lasso regression, we modeled quantitatively the responses of breast cancer cell lines to ~90 drugs. Lasso and elastic net regression identified HER2 as a predictor protein for lapatinib, afatinib, gefitinib and erlotinib, which target HER2 or the EGF receptor, thus providing an internal control for the approach. Two additional protein datasets and two RNA datasets were also tested as sources of predictor proteins for modeling drug sensitivity. Protein expression measured by mass spectrometry gave models with higher coefficients of determination than did reverse phase protein array (RPPA) predictor data. Further, cross validation of the elastic net models shows that, for many drugs, the prediction error is lower when the predictor data is from proteins, rather than mRNA expression measured on microarrays. Drugs that could be modeled effectively include PI3K inhibitors, Akt inhibitors, paclitaxel and docetaxel, rapamycin, everolimus and temsirolimus, gemcitabine and vinorelbine. Strikingly, this modeling approach with protein predictors often succeeds for drugs that are targeted agents, even when the nominal target is not in the dataset.",2015,Journal of proteomics & bioinformatics
A between-Class Overlapping Filter-Based Method for transcriptome Data Analysis,"Feature selection algorithms play a crucial role in identifying and discovering important genes for cancer classification. Feature selection algorithms can be broadly categorized into two main groups: filter-based methods and wrapper-based methods. Filter-based methods have been quite popular in the literature due to their many advantages, including computational efficiency, simplistic architecture, and an intuitively simple means of discovering biological and clinical aspects. However, these methods have limitations, and the classification accuracy of the selected genes is less accurate. In this paper, we propose a set of univariate filter-based methods using a between-class overlapping criterion. The proposed techniques have been compared with many other univariate filter-based methods using an acute leukemia dataset. The following properties have been examined: classification accuracy of the selected individual genes and the gene subsets; redundancy check among selected genes using ridge regression and LASSO methods; similarity and sensitivity analyses; functional analysis; and, stability analysis. A comprehensive experiment shows promising results for our proposed techniques. The univariate filter based methods using between-class overlapping criterion are accurate and robust, have biological significance, and are computationally efficient and easy to implement. Therefore, they are well suited for biological and clinical discoveries.",2012,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology

Dataset for: Recurrence-associated gene signature optimizes recurrence free survival prediction of colorectal cancer,"High throughput gene expression profiling has showed great promise in providing insight into molecular mechanisms. Metastasis-related mRNAs may potentially enrich genes with the ability to predict cancer recurrenceï¼Œtherefore we attempted to build a recurrence-associated gene signature to improve prognostic prediction of colorectal cancer (CRC). We identified 2848 differentially expressed mRNAs by analyzing CRC tissues with or without metastasis. For the selection of prognostic genes, a LASSO Cox regression model was employed. Using this method, a 13-mRNA signature was identified and then validated in two independent Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohorts. This classifier could successfully discriminate the high-risk patients in discovery cohort (HR = 5.27, 95%CI= 2.30-12.08, P < 0.0001). Analysis in two independent cohorts yielded consistent results (GSE14333: HR=4.55, 95%CI=2.18 â€“ 9.508, P<0.0001) (GSE33113: HR=3.26, 95%CI=2.16 â€“ 9.16, P=0.0176). Further analysis revealed that the prognostic value of this signature was independent of tumor stage, postoperative chemotherapy and somatic mutation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of this signature was 0.8861 and 0.8157 in the discovery and validation cohort, respectively. A nomogram was constructed for clinicians, which did well in the calibration plots. Furthermore, this 13-mRNA signature outperformed other known gene signatures, including oncotypeDX colon cancer assay. Single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) revealed that a group of pathways related to drug resistance, cancer metastasis and stemness were significantly enriched in the high-risk patients. In conclusion, this 13-mRNA signature may be a useful tool for prognostic evaluation and will facilitate personalized management of CRC patients.",2017,
An Algorithmic Approach to Linear Regression Bachelor Thesis 1,"We analyze a procedure how to build a high quality linear regression model. We start with an overview of the desirable properties, for example robustness and limited pairwise multicollinearity, of the linear regression model. We discuss the problem that the current approaches are not capable to find a linear regression model with the desirable properties. Therefore, our goal is to find a procedure that produces a linear regression model which achieves the desirable properties in a reasonable amount of time. We present an algorithmic approach in which the desirable properties are modeled as constraints and through penalties in the objective function of a Mixed Integer Quadratic Optimization (MIQO) model. The performance of the algorithm is shown on both real and synthetic data sets, and is compared with the widely used Lasso approach from Tibshirani (1996). Lastly, we extent the MIQO model with a heuristically chosen subset of interaction terms and compare the performance of the heuristic with Lasso on a synthetic data set.",2018,
Moderated Network Models.,"Pairwise network models such as the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) are a powerful and intuitive way to analyze dependencies in multivariate data. A key assumption of the GGM is that each pairwise interaction is independent of the values of all other variables. However, in psychological research, this is often implausible. In this article, we extend the GGM by allowing each pairwise interaction between two variables to be moderated by (a subset of) all other variables in the model, and thereby introduce a Moderated Network Model (MNM). We show how to construct MNMs and propose an [Formula: see text]-regularized nodewise regression approach to estimate them. We provide performance results in a simulation study and show that MNMs outperform the split-sample based methods Network Comparison Test (NCT) and Fused Graphical Lasso (FGL) in detecting moderation effects. Finally, we provide a fully reproducible tutorial on how to estimate MNMs with the R-package mgm and discuss possible issues with model misspecification.",2019,Multivariate behavioral research
Performance Analysis of Updating-QR Supported OLS Against Stochastic Gradient Descent,"Regression model is a well-studied method for the prediction of real-valued data. Depending on the structure of the data involved, different approaches have been adopted for estimating the parameters which includes the Linear Equation solver, Gradient Descent, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the like. The performance of each of them varies based on the data size and computation involved. Many methods have been introduced to improve their performance like QR factorization in least squares problem. Our focus is on the analysis of performance of gradient descent and QR based ordinary least squares for estimating and updating the parameters under varying data size. We have considered both tall/skinny as well as short/fat matrices. We have implemented Block Householders method of QR factorization in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform using Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) GTX 645 with the initial set of data. New upcoming data is updated directly to the existing Q and R factors rather than applying QR factorization from the scratch. This updating-QR platform is then utilized for performing regression analysis. This will support the regression analysis process on-the-fly. The results are then compared against the gradient descent implemented. The results prove that parallel-QR method for regression analysis achieves speed-up of up to 22x compared with the gradient descent method when the attribute size is larger than the sample size and speed-up of up to 2x when the sample size is larger than the attribute size. Our implementation results also prove that the updating-QR method achieves speed-up approaching 2x over the gradient descent method for large datasets when the sample size is less than the attribute size.",2016,
A Model-based approach to transcription regulatory network reconstruction from time-course gene expression data,"Time-course gene expression profiling provides valuable data on dynamic behavior of cellular responses to external stimulation. Investigation of transcription factors (TFs) that regulate co-expressed genes in a dynamic process can reveal insights on the underlying molecular mechanisms. As the ChIP-seq technology is only suitable for a fraction of TFs in mammalian organisms, the computational identification of relevant TFs remains to be critical. We propose a regression-based model to infer the functional binding sites of TFs from time-course gene expression profiles. Our approach incorporates an association strength for each potential TF and target gene pair based on computational analysis of binding sites in promoter sequences of co-expressed genes. Our model further uses the Lasso-penalized technique to search for the most informative TF-target pairs. The application of our method to a gene expression study on E2-induced apoptosis in a variant of MCF-7 cells revealed that the findings are biologically meaningful.",2014,2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society
No Reference Quality Assessment for Multiply-Distorted Images Based on an Improved Bag-of-Words Model,"Multiple distortion assessment is a big challenge in image quality assessment (IQA). In this letter, a no reference IQA model for multiply-distorted images is proposed. The features, which are sensitive to each distortion type even in the presence of other distortions, are first selected from three kinds of NSS features. An improved Bag-of-Words (BoW) model is then applied to encode the selected features. Lastly, a simple yet effective linear combination is used to map the image features to the quality score. The combination weights are obtained through lasso regression. A series of experiments show that the feature selection strategy and the improved BoW model are effective in improving the accuracy of quality prediction for multiple distortion IQA. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed method delivers the best result for multiple distortion IQA.",2015,IEEE Signal Processing Letters
Model selection procedures for high dimensional genomic,"Many complex diseases are thought to be caused by multiple genetic variants. Recent advances in genotyping technology allowed investigators of a complex disease to obtain data for a massive number of candidate genetic variants. Typically each candidate variant is tested individually for an association with the disease. We approach the problem as one of model selection for high dimensional data. We propose a method whereby penalised maximum likelihood estimation provides a reasonably sized set of variants for inclusion in our model. We then perform stepwise regression on this set of variants to arrive at our model. Penalised maximum likelihood estimation is performed with both the lasso and a more recently developed method known as the hyperlasso, with smoothing parameters chosen by cross-validation. The hyperlasso has a penalty function that favours sparser solutions but with less shrinkage of those variables that are included in the model, when compared to the lasso; however, this comes at extra computational cost. We apply the above method to a large genomic data set from a previously published mice obesity study and use resample model averaging to assess model performance.

Gender based survival prediction models for heart failure patients: A case study in Pakistan,"OBJECTIVES
The objective of this study was to build and assess the performance of survival prediction models using the gender-specific informative risk factors for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.


METHODS
A lasso approach was used to decide the informative predictors for building semi-parametric proportional hazards Cox model. Separate models were built for all patients [N = 299], male patients [Nmale = 194 (64.88%)], and female patients [Nfemale = 105 (35.12%)], to observe the risk factors associated with the individual's risk of death. The likelihood- ratio test was used to test the goodness of fit of the selected model, and the C-index was used to assess the predictive performance of the selected model(s) with respect to the overall model with all observed risk factors.


RESULTS
The survival prediction model for females is notably different from that for males. For males, smoking, diabetes, and anaemia, whereas for females, ejection fraction, sodium, and platelets count are non-informative with zero regression coefficients. The goodness of fit of the selected models with respect to the general model with all observed risk factors is tested using the likelihood-ratio test. The results are in favor of the selected models with p-values 0.51,0.61, and 0.70 for all patients, male patients, and female patients, respectively. The same values of C-index for the full model and the selected models for overall data, for males, and for females (0.72, 0.73, and 0.77 for overall data, male data, and female data, respectively) indicate that the selected models are as good as the corresponding overall models regarding their predictive performance.


CONCLUSION
There is a substantial difference in the survival prediction models for heart failure (HF) of male and female patients in this study. More studies are needed in Pakistan for confirming this striking male-female difference regarding the potential risk factors to predict survival with heart failure.",2019,PLoS ONE
Sparse Regression Models of Pain Perception,"Discovering brain mechanisms underlying pain perception remains a challenging neuroscientific problem with important practical applications, such as developing better treatments for chronic pain. Herein, we focus on statistical analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) data associated with pain stimuli. While the traditional mass-univariate GLM [8] analysis of pain-related brain activation can miss potentially informative voxel interaction patterns, our approach relies instead on multivariate predictive modeling methods such as sparse regression (LASSO [17] and, more generally, Elastic Net (EN) [18]) that can learn accurate predictive models of pain and simultaneously discover brain activity patterns (relatively small subsets of voxels) allowing for such predictions. Moreover, we investigate the effect of temporal (time-lagged) information, often ignored in traditional fMRI studies, on the predictive accuracy and on the selection of brain areas relevant to pain perception. We demonstrate that (1) Elastic Net regression can be highly predictive of pain perception, by far outperforming ordinary leastsquares (OLS) linear regression; (2) temporal information is very important for pain perception modeling and can significantly increase the prediction accuracy; (3) moreover, regression models that incorporate temporal information discover brain activation patterns undetected by non-temporal models.",2010,
Functional models in genome-wide selection,"The development of sequencing technologies has enabled the discovery of markers that are abundantly distributed over the whole genome. Knowledge about the marker locations in reference genomes provides further insights in the search for causal regions and the prediction of genomic values. The present study proposes a Bayesian functional approach for incorporating the marker locations into genomic analysis using stochastic methods to search causal regions and predict genotypic values. For this, three scenarios were analyzed: F2 population with 300 individuals and three different heritability levels (0.2, 0.5, and 0.8), along with 12,150 SNP markers that were distributed through ten linkage groups; Fâˆž populations with 320 individuals and three different heritability levels (0.2, 0.5, and 0.8), along with 10,020 SNP markers that were distributed through ten linkage groups; and data related to Eucalyptus spp. to measure the model performance in a real LD setting, with 611 individuals whose phenotypes were simulated from QTLs distributed through a panel of 36,812 SNPs with known positions. The performance of the proposed method was compared with those of other genome selection models, namely, RR-BLUP, Bayes B and Bayesian Lasso. The Bayesian functional model presented higher or similar predictive ability when compared with those classical regressions methods in simulated and real scenarios on different LD structures. In general, the Bayesian functional model also achieved higher computational efficiency, using 12 SNPs per MCMC round. The model was efficient in the identification of causal regions and showed high flexibility of analysis, as it is easily adaptable to any genomic selection model.",2019,PLoS ONE
Trough concentration over 12.1 mg/L is a major risk factor of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity in patients with therapeutic drug monitoring.,"BACKGROUND
High doses of vancomycin increase the risk of nephrotoxicity, but the quantitative relationship between vancomycin exposure and nephrotoxicity is still controversial. This study evaluated the relationship between vancomycin trough concentration and nephrotoxicity, and risk factors for nephrotoxicity in patients undergoing therapeutic drug monitoring.


METHODS
A total of 1269 cases from patients who underwent therapeutic drug monitoring were collected from 2006 to 2010. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between trough concentration and the incidence of nephrotoxicity. Logistic regression using the generalized Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso) method was used to evaluate possible risk factors for nephrotoxicity. The data were divided into high/low-concentration groups by the cutoff value obtained from the receiver operating characteristic curve, and additional logistic regression using the generalized lasso method was performed for each group.


RESULTS
The cutoff value of the vancomycin trough concentration was 12.1 mg/L. Patients with high concentrations (>12.1 mg/L) were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity (odds ratio = 16.0, 95% confidence interval, 8.2-31.1). The vancomycin trough concentration was the only significant risk factor for nephrotoxicity identified using the generalized lasso (P < 0.001). In contrast, no factor was associated with nephrotoxicity in the low-concentration group.


CONCLUSIONS
Vancomycin trough concentrations over 12.1 mg/L were associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity. This is lower than the known threshold. Trough vancomycin concentration over the threshold was the only risk factor of nephrotoxicity among demographic factors, dosing regimen, and other clinical conditions in this study. It is suggested that vancomycin trough concentrations greater than 12.1 mg/L require close monitoring for nephrotoxicity.",2014,Therapeutic drug monitoring
Do psychological factors or radiographic severity play a role in the age of onset in symptomatic developmental dysplasia of hip and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome?,"BackgroundAge of onset in symptomatic developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) varies. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether psychological factors, radiographic, and clinical variables were related to age of onset of hip pain in DDH and FAIS.MethodsWe collected demographic, clinical, and radiographic data on 56 DDH and 84 FAIS patients. Each was diagnosed based on radiographic findings and clinical history. Age of onset was operationalized by subtracting patient reported duration of symptoms from patient age at presentation. Pain catastrophizing (PCS) and depression were assessed with the pain catastrophizing scale and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), respectively. Multiple linear regression modeling, with Lasso variable selection, was implemented.ResultsPain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression were not significantly related to age of DDH onset (p-values >â€‰0.27) or age of FAIS onset (p-values >â€‰0.29). LASSO-penalized linear regression revealed alpha Dunn angle, Tonnis grade, prior hip surgery, WOMAC pain score, and iHOT total score were associated with age of onset in FAIS (Adjusted R2â€‰=â€‰0.3099). Lateral center edge angle (LCEA), alpha frog angle, Tonnis grade, SF12 physical functioning, and body mass index (BMI) were associated with age of DDH onset (Adjusted R2â€‰=â€‰0.3578).ConclusionsPsychological factors, as measured by PCS and HADS, were not associated with age of onset in DDH or FAIS. Functional impairment as measured by WOMAC pain and impaired active lifestyle as measured by iHOT were found to affect age of FAIS onset. For DDH, impaired physical functioning and increasing BMI were found to be associated with age of onset. Severity of the disease, as measured radiographically by LCEA and alpha Dunn angle, was also found to be associated with earlier age of onset in DDH and FAIS, respectively. A patientâ€™s radiographic severity may have more of a relationship to the onset of pain than physiologic factors.",2019,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders
Random weighting to approximate posterior inference in LASSO regression,"We consider a general-purpose approximation approach to Bayesian inference in which repeated optimization of a randomized objective function provides surrogate samples from the joint posterior distribution. In the context of LASSO regression, we repeatedly assign independently-drawn standard-exponential random weights to terms in the objective function, and optimize to obtain the surrogate samples. We establish the asymptotic properties of this method under different regularization parameters $\lambda_n$. In particular, if $\lambda_n = o(\sqrt{n})$, then the random-weighting (weighted bootstrap) samples are equivalent (up to the first order) to the Bayesian posterior samples. If $\lambda_n = \mathcal{O} \left( n^c \right)$ for some $1/2 < c < 1$, then these samples achieve conditional model selection consistency. We also establish the asymptotic properties of the random-weighting method when weights are drawn from other distributions, and also if weights are assigned to the LASSO penalty terms.",2020,arXiv: Methodology
Contextual Correlates of Physical Activity among Older Adults: A Neighborhood Environment-Wide Association Study (NE-WAS).,"Background: Few older adults achieve recommended physical activity levels. We conducted a ""neighborhood environment-wide association study (NE-WAS)"" of neighborhood influences on physical activity among older adults, analogous, in a genetic context, to a genome-wide association study.Methods: Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and sociodemographic data were collected via telephone survey of 3,497 residents of New York City aged 65 to 75 years. Using Geographic Information Systems, we created 337 variables describing each participant's residential neighborhood's built, social, and economic context. We used survey-weighted regression models adjusting for individual-level covariates to test for associations between each neighborhood variable and (i) total PASE score, (ii) gardening activity, (iii) walking, and (iv) housework (as a negative control). We also applied two ""Big Data"" analytic techniques, LASSO regression, and Random Forests, to algorithmically select neighborhood variables predictive of these four physical activity measures.Results: Of all 337 measures, proportion of residents living in extreme poverty was most strongly associated with total physical activity [-0.85; (95% confidence interval, -1.14 to -0.56) PASE units per 1% increase in proportion of residents living with household incomes less than half the federal poverty line]. Only neighborhood socioeconomic status and disorder measures were associated with total activity and gardening, whereas a broader range of measures was associated with walking. As expected, no neighborhood meaZsures were associated with housework after accounting for multiple comparisons.Conclusions: This systematic approach revealed patterns in the domains of neighborhood measures associated with physical activity.Impact: The NE-WAS approach appears to be a promising exploratory technique.

Sampling Lasso quantile regression for large-scale data,"ABSTRACT With the quantile regression methods successfully applied in various applications, we often need to tackle with the big dataset with thousands of variables and millions of observations. In this article, we focus on the variable selection aspect of penalized quantile regression, and propose a new method Sampling Lasso Quantile Regression (SLQR), which allows selecting a small amount but informative data for fitting quantile regression models. Different from the ordinary regularization methods, this SLQR method performs a sampling technique to reduce the number of observations before applying Lasso. Through numerical simulation studies and real application in Greenhouse Gas Observing Network, we illustrate the efficacy of the SLQR method. The numerical results show that the SLQR method is able to achieve a high-precision quantile regression on large-scale data for both prediction and interpretation.",2018,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
Estimation and Selection via Absolute Penalized Convex Minimization And Its Multistage Adaptive Applications,"The â„“1-penalized method, or the Lasso, has emerged as an important tool for the analysis of large data sets. Many important results have been obtained for the Lasso in linear regression which have led to a deeper understanding of high-dimensional statistical problems. In this article, we consider a class of weighted â„“1-penalized estimators for convex loss functions of a general form, including the generalized linear models. We study the estimation, prediction, selection and sparsity properties of the weighted â„“1-penalized estimator in sparse, high-dimensional settings where the number of predictors p can be much larger than the sample size n. Adaptive Lasso is considered as a special case. A multistage method is developed to approximate concave regularized estimation by applying an adaptive Lasso recursively. We provide prediction and estimation oracle inequalities for single- and multi-stage estimators, a general selection consistency theorem, and an upper bound for the dimension of the Lasso estimator. Important models including the linear regression, logistic regression and log-linear models are used throughout to illustrate the applications of the general results.",2012,Journal of machine learning research : JMLR
Lag weighted lasso for time series model,"The adaptive lasso can consistently identify the true model in regression model. However, the adaptive lasso cannot account for lag effects, which are essential for a time series model. Consequently, the adaptive lasso can not reflect certain properties of a time series model. To improve the forecast accuracy of a time series model, we propose a lag weighted lasso. The lag weighted lasso imposes different penalties on each coefficient based on weights that reflect not only the coefficients size but also the lag effects. Simulation studies and a real example show that the proposed method is superior to both the lasso and the adaptive lasso in forecast accuracy.",2013,Computational Statistics
Predicting quantitative traits with regression models for dense molecular markers and pedigree.,"The availability of genomewide dense markers brings opportunities and challenges to breeding programs. An important question concerns the ways in which dense markers and pedigrees, together with phenotypic records, should be used to arrive at predictions of genetic values for complex traits. If a large number of markers are included in a regression model, marker-specific shrinkage of regression coefficients may be needed. For this reason, the Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (BL) appears to be an interesting approach for fitting marker effects in a regression model. This article adapts the BL to arrive at a regression model where markers, pedigrees, and covariates other than markers are considered jointly. Connections between BL and other marker-based regression models are discussed, and the sensitivity of BL with respect to the choice of prior distributions assigned to key parameters is evaluated using simulation. The proposed model was fitted to two data sets from wheat and mouse populations, and evaluated using cross-validation methods. Results indicate that inclusion of markers in the regression further improved the predictive ability of models. An R program that implements the proposed model is freely available.",2009,Genetics
Radiomics analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient in cervical cancer: A preliminary study on histological grade evaluation,"BACKGROUND
The role of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-based radiomics features in evaluating histopathological grade of cervical cancer is unresolved.


PURPOSE
To determine if there is a difference between radiomics features derived from center-slice 2D versus whole-tumor volumetric 3D for ADC measurements in patients with cervical cancer regarding tumor histopathological grade, and systematically assess the impact of the b value on radiomics analysis in ADC quantifications.


STUDY TYPE
Prospective.


SUBJECTS
In all, 160 patients with histopathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
Conventional and diffusion-weighted MR images (b valuesâ€‰=â€‰0, 800, 1000 s/mm2 ) were acquired on a 3.0T MR scanner.


ASSESSMENT
Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually along the margin of tumor on each slice, and then the center slice of the tumor was selected with naked eyes in the course of whole-tumor segmentation. A total of 624 radiomics features were derived from T2 -weighted images and ADC maps. We randomly selected 50 cases and did the reproducibility analysis.


STATISTICAL TESTS
Parameters were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test, Bland-Altman analysis, t-test, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression with crossvalidation.


RESULTS
In all, 95 radiomics features were insensitive to ROI variation among T2 images, ADC map of b800, and ADC map of b1000 (P > 0.0002). There was a significant statistical difference between the performances of 2D center-slice and 3D whole-tumor radiomics models in both ADC feature sets of b800 and b1000 (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001). Compared with ADC features of b800 (0.3758â€‰Â±â€‰0.0118), the model of b1000 ADC features appeared to be slightly lower in overall misclassification error (0.3642â€‰Â±â€‰0.0162) (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0076).


DATA CONCLUSION
Several radiomics features extracted from T2 images and ADC maps were highly reproducible. Whole-tumor volumetric 3D radiomics analysis had a better performance than using the 2D center-slice of tumor in stratifying the histological grade of cervical cancer. A b value of 1000 s/mm2 is suggested as the optimal parameter in pelvic DWI scans.

357-OR: Early Pregnancy Trace Element Mixtures and Gestational Glucose Levels Late in the 2nd Trimester,"Background: A number of essential trace elements are involved in glucose metabolism, but the associations between these elements and glucose levels among pregnant women are unclear. Furthermore, little is known about the joint association of these trace elements. Methods: We used data from 1857 women enrolled in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Study, for whom trace element status (Zn, Se, Cu, Mo) was determined using plasma collected during the 1 st trimester. Non-fasting glucose levels were measured during the GDM screening test. Three approaches were used to assess the joint effects of these trace elements on glucose levels. First, all four trace elements were included in a multivariable linear model and adaptive lasso was performed for model selection. Second, generalized additive models (GAMs) with model selection were fitted to allow non-linear associations. Lastly, a novel method, Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) was used to model the dose-response relationships of the trace element mixture in a non-parametric fashion. Results: In the multivariable linear model, we observed significant associations of glucose levels with plasma Cu (2.4 mg/dL increase per 1 SD increase on the log scale; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.7) and plasma Mo (-1.4 mg/dL decrease per 1 SD increase on the log scale; 95% CI: -2.6, -0.1). The GAM showed suggestive evidence of non-linear positive interaction between Zn and Cu in plasma (p-value = 0.052). Similar results were observed using the BKMR approach. Conclusion: Employing different statistical methods to study the effect of early pregnancy trace element mixtures on glucose levels, we found consistent evidences of hyperglycemic effect of Cu and hypoglycemic effect of Mo, as well as potential synergism between Zn and Cu. Future work is needed to better understand the joint effects of these elements in the context of the increasingly insulin-resistant state of pregnancy. Disclosure Y. Zheng: None. C. Zhang: None. P.L.
