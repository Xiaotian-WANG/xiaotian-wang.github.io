Contributions de l'apprentissage statistique aux mÃ©thodes GLMM et LASSO: Application Ã  la modÃ©lisation statistique de la morbiditÃ© liÃ©e au paludisme Ã  Tori-Bossito (BÃ©nin),"L'objectif principal de cette these est la determination des facteurs 
environnementaux pouvant expliquer la variabilite de la densite 
anophelienne et la prediction du risque d'exposition au vecteur palustre au niveau village et maison de la zone de Tori-Bossito. 
Dans ce travail, nous avons considere ces deux problemes 
comme des problemes de seection de variables et de prediction dans 
le contexte epidemiologique. L'objectif principal est alors de selectionner 
un sous ensemble optimal de variables pertinentes pour la prediction du risque d'exposition 
 au vecteur palustre dans le milieu d'etude ainsi que dans un autre milieu 
ou les donnees entomologiques ne sont pas disponibles. Dans la premiere partie de cette These, nous 
avons propose une methode basee sur un algorithme de type GLMM combine avec une 
 selection 
de variables de type backward. Des effets 
aleatoires ont ete mis au niveau de chaque hierarchie des donnees pour prendre 
en compte les possibles correlations a cause de la structure hierarchique 
des donnees. Les resultats ont permis de determiner un sous ensemble 
optimal pour la prediction du risque palustre. Ces algorithmes 
deviennent non convergents lorsque les donnees possedent 
une structure 
particuliere ou sont tres correlees. Dans la 
seconde partie de cette These, nous avons donc propose une methode d'apprentissage 
machine automatique. Cette methode combine 
le GLM, le Lasso et une validation croisee stratifiee 
a deux niveaux. Nous avons genere automatiquement les interactions 
entre les variables. La selection de variables a ete faite par la combinaison GLM, 
Lasso et validation croisee. Les variables 
selectionnees sont debiaisees par le GLM pour faire de la prediction. 
Les resultats obtenus montrent que 
les pre-traitements 
effectues par les experts sur les donnees peuvent etre 
surmontes. Aussi, ces resultats montrent une 
amelioration au niveau de la selection, de la 
sparsite du sous ensemble optimal pour la prediction, 
la qualite des predictions et le temps CPU d'execution 
des calculs.

Panda: AdaPtive Noisy Data Augmentation for Regularization of Undirected Graphical Models,"We propose PANDA, an AdaPtive Noise Augmentation technique to regularize estimating and constructing undirected graphical models (UGMs). PANDA iteratively solves MLEs given noise augmented data in the regression-based framework until convergence to achieve the designed regularization effects. The augmented noises can be designed to achieve various regularization effects on graph estimation, including the bridge, elastic net, adaptive lasso, and SCAD penalization; it can also offer group lasso and fused ridge when some nodes belong to the same group. We establish theoretically that the noise-augmented loss functions and its minimizer converge almost surely to the expected penalized loss function and its minimizer, respectively. We derive the asymptotic distributions for the regularized regression coefficients through PANDA in GLMs, based on which, the inferences for the parameters can be obtained simultaneously with variable selection. Our empirical results suggest the inferences achieve nominal or near-nominal coverage and are far more efficient compared to some existing post-selection procedures. On the algorithm level, PANDA can be easily programmed in any standard software without resorting to complicated optimization techniques. We show the non-inferior performance of PANDA in constructing graphs of different types in simulation studies and also apply PANDA to the autism spectrum disorder data to construct a mixed-node graph.",2018,ArXiv
Evaluation of an Algorithm for Identifying Ocular Conditions in Electronic Health Record Data,"Importance For research involving big data, researchers must accurately identify patients with ocular diseases or phenotypes of interest. Reliance on administrative billing codes alone for this purpose is limiting. Objective To develop a method to accurately identify the presence or absence of ocular conditions of interest using electronic health record (EHR) data. Design, Setting, and Participants This study is a retrospective analysis of the EHR data of patients (nâ€‰=â€‰122 339) in the Sight Outcomes Research Collaborative Ophthalmology Data Repository who received eye care at participating academic medical centers between August 1, 2012, and August 31, 2017. An algorithm that searches structured and unstructured (free-text) EHR data for conditions of interest was developed and then tested to determine how well it could detect the presence or absence of exfoliation syndrome (XFS). The algorithm was trained to search for evidence of XFS among a sample of patients with and without XFS (nâ€‰=â€‰200) by reviewing International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-9 or ICD-10) billing codes, the patientâ€™s problem list, and text within the ocular examination section and unstructured (free-text) data in the EHR. The likelihood that each patient had XFS was estimated using logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The EHR data of all patients were run through the algorithm to generate an XFS probability score for each patient. The algorithm was validated with review of EHRs by glaucoma specialists. Main Outcomes and Measures Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the algorithm were computed as the proportion of patients correctly classified with XFS or without XFS. Results This study included 122 339 patients, with a mean (SD) age of 52.4â€‰(25.1) years. Of these patients, 69 002 (56.4%) were female and 99 579 (81.4%) were white. The algorithm assigned a less than 10% probability of XFS for 121 085 patients (99.0%) as well as an XFS probability score of more than 75% for 543 patients (0.4%), more than 90% for 353 patients (0.3%), and more than 99% for 83 patients (0.07%). Validated by glaucoma specialists, the algorithm had a PPV of 95.0% (95% CI, 89.5%-97.7%) and an NPV of 100% (95% CI, 91.2%-100%). When there was ICD-9 or ICD-10 billing code documentation of XFS, in 86% or 96% of the records, respectively, evidence of XFS was also recorded elsewhere in the EHR. Conversely, when there was clinical examination or free-text evidence of XFS, it was documented with ICD-9 codes only approximately 40% of the time and even less often with ICD-10 codes. Conclusions and Relevance The algorithm developed, tested, and validated in this study appears to be better at identifying the presence or absence of XFS in EHR data than the conventional approach of assessing only billing codes; such an algorithm may enhance the ability of investigators to use EHR data to study patients with ocular diseases.",2019,JAMA Ophthalmology
Predictor ranking and false discovery proportion control in high-dimensional regression,"We propose a ranking and selection procedure to prioritize relevant predictors and control false discovery proportion (FDP) in variable selection. Our procedure utilizes a new ranking method built upon the de-sparsified Lasso estimator. We show that the new ranking method achieves the optimal order of minimum non-zero effects in ranking relevant predictors ahead of irrelevant ones. Adopting the new ranking method, we develop a variable selection procedure to asymptotically control FDP at a user-specified level. We show that our procedure can consistently estimate the FDP of variable selection as long as the de-sparsified Lasso estimator is asymptotically normal. In simulations, our procedure compares favorably to existing methods in ranking efficiency and FDP control when the regression model is relatively sparse.",2019,J. Multivar. Anal.
The degrees of freedom of partly smooth regularizers,"We study regularized regression problems where the regularizer is a proper, lower-semicontinuous, convex and partly smooth function relative to a Riemannian submanifold. This encompasses several popular examples including the Lasso, the group Lasso, the max and nuclear norms, as well as their composition with linear operators (e.g., total variation or fused Lasso). Our main sensitivity analysis result shows that the predictor moves locally stably along the same active submanifold as the observations undergo small perturbations. This plays a pivotal role in getting a closed-form expression for the divergence of the predictor w.r.t. observations. We also show that, for many regularizers, including polyhedral ones or the analysis group Lasso, this divergence formula holds Lebesgue a.e. When the perturbation is random (with an appropriate continuous distribution), this allows us to derive an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom and the prediction risk. Our results unify and go beyond those already known in the literature.",2014,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
Structured kernel quantile regression,"Quantile regression can provide more useful information on the conditional distribution of a response variable given covariates while classical regression provides informations on the conditional mean alone. In this paper, we propose a structured quantile estimation methodology in a nonparametric function estimation setup. Through the functional analysis of variance decomposition, the optimization of the proposed method can be solved using a series of quadratic and linear programmings. Our method automatically selects relevant covariates by adopting a lasso-type penalty. The performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated through numerical examples on both simulated and real data.",2013,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
A uniform framework for the combination of penalties in generalized structured models,"Penalized estimation has become an established tool for regularization and model selection in regression models. A variety of penalties with specific features are available and effective algorithms for specific penalties have been proposed. But not much is available to fit models with a combination of different penalties. When modeling the rent data of Munich as in our application, various types of predictors call for a combination of a Ridge, a group Lasso and a Lasso-type penalty within one model. We propose to approximate penalties that are (semi-)norms of scalar linear transformations of the coefficient vector in generalized structured modelsâ€”such that penalties of various kinds can be combined in one model. The approach is very general such that the Lasso, the fused Lasso, the Ridge, the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty, the elastic net and many more penalties are embedded. The computation is based on conventional penalized iteratively re-weighted least squares algorithms and hence, easy to implement. New penalties can be incorporated quickly. The approach is extended to penalties with vector based arguments. There are several possibilities to choose the penalty parameter(s). A software implementation is available. Some illustrative examples show promising results.",2017,Advances in Data Analysis and Classification
Predicting atrial fibrillation in primary care using machine learning,"BACKGROUND
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained heart arrhythmia. However, as many cases are asymptomatic, a large proportion of patients remain undiagnosed until serious complications arise. Efficient, cost-effective detection of the undiagnosed may be supported by risk-prediction models relating patient factors to AF risk. However, there exists a need for an implementable risk model that is contemporaneous and informed by routinely collected patient data, reflecting the real-world pathology of AF.


METHODS
This study sought to develop and evaluate novel and conventional statistical and machine learning models for risk-predication of AF. This was a retrospective, cohort study of adults (aged â‰¥30 years) without a history of AF, listed on the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, from January 2006 to December 2016. Models evaluated included published risk models (Framingham, ARIC, CHARGE-AF), machine learning models, which evaluated baseline and time-updated information (neural network, LASSO, random forests, support vector machines), and Cox regression.


RESULTS
Analysis of 2,994,837 individuals (3.2% AF) identified time-varying neural networks as the optimal model achieving an AUROC of 0.827 vs. 0.725, with number needed to screen of 9 vs. 13 patients at 75% sensitivity, when compared with the best existing model CHARGE-AF. The optimal model confirmed known baseline risk factors (age, previous cardiovascular disease, antihypertensive medication usage) and identified additional time-varying predictors (proximity of cardiovascular events, body mass index (both levels and changes), pulse pressure, and the frequency of blood pressure measurements).


CONCLUSION
The optimal time-varying machine learning model exhibited greater predictive performance than existing AF risk models and reflected known and new patient risk factors for AF.",2019,PLoS ONE
Multivariate Statistical Analysis for Estimating Grassland Leaf Area Index and Chlorophyll Content using Hyperspectral Data,"DISCLAIMER This document describes work undertaken as part of a programme of study at the Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation of the University of Twente. All views and opinions expressed therein remain the sole responsibility of the author, and do not necessarily represent those of the Faculty. ABSTRACT Grassland habitat covers about one-quarter of the Earth's land surface, providing significant contribution to the world's total agricultural production, plant biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Remote sensing (RS) provides a practical and cost-effective means for quantifying grassland biophysical and biochemical properties. However, grassland presents a challenge for RS due to the complexity of their spectral response. The advent of hyperspectral RS and the future launch of planned spaceborne hyperspectral missions will open up new possibilities over conventional multispectral RS to better quantify grassland characteristics. In this regard, hyperspectral data, while rich in information, presents a challenge for analysis due to its high dimensionality and multicollinearity. This present study investigated four selected high dimensional multivariate regression methods namely partial least squares regression (PLSR), regularization and shrinkage method Lasso, nonparametric Random Forest (RF) regression, and ensemble method Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to predict grassland leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll using field canopy hyperspectral measurements (n=185). For each regression model, three spectral transformations namely continuum-removal, first-derivative, and pseudo-absorbance were evaluated. The results showed that relatively good predictive accuracy could be obtained for canopy-integrated chlorophyll content (cross-validated R 2 =0.760; relative RMSE=32.1% or 0.28) and LAI (R 2 =0.719; relative RMSE=28.9% or 0.81), whereas leaf chlorophyll content could be predicted with relatively low accuracy (R 2 =0.492; relative RMSE=14.8% or 4.45). Multivariate methods utilizing all wavebands (whole spectral analysis) outperformed Lasso which performed waveband selection (optimal spectral analysis), suggesting some loss of information in the latter. Compared to the gold-standard model PLSR, no significant improvement in accuracy was obtained by the alternative multivariate regression models. Further, the spectral transformations in general did not significantly improve the accuracy either. This could suggest that the prediction errors were likely the results of grassland canopy spectral complexity due to heterogeneity such as the presence of different grass species having different canopy architecture. Therefore, approaches that explicitly account for structural differences such as model stratification based on species, incorporation of multiple structural parameters as in 3-D radiative transfer model for heterogeneous canopy, and data integration with radar or lidar capable of extracting the structural parameters are potentially useful. â€¦",2015,
Linear growth faltering in infants is associated with Acidaminococcus sp. and community-level changes in the gut microbiota,"BackgroundChronic malnutrition, termed stunting, is defined as suboptimal linear growth, affects one third of children in developing countries, and leads to increased mortality and poor developmental outcomes. The causes of childhood stunting are unknown, and strategies to improve growth and related outcomes in children have only had modest impacts. Recent studies have shown that the ecosystem of microbes in the human gut, termed the microbiota, can induce changes in weight. However, the specific changes in the gut microbiota that contribute to growth remain unknown, and no studies have investigated the gut microbiota as a determinant of chronic malnutrition.ResultsWe performed secondary analyses of data from two well-characterized twin cohorts of children from Malawi and Bangladesh to identify bacterial genera associated with linear growth. In a case-control analysis, we used the graphical lasso to estimate covariance network models of gut microbial interactions from relative genus abundances and used network analysis methods to select genera associated with stunting severity. In longitudinal analyses, we determined associations between these selected microbes and linear growth using between-within twin regression models to adjust for confounding and introduce temporality. Reduced microbiota diversity and increased covariance network density were associated with stunting severity, while increased relative abundance of Acidaminococcus sp. was associated with future linear growth deficits.ConclusionsWe show that length growth in children is associated with community-wide changes in the gut microbiota and with the abundance of the bacterial genus, Acidaminococcus. Larger cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and to clarify the mechanisms involved.",2015,Microbiome
Prediction of Aneurysm Stability Using a Machine Learning Model Based on PyRadiomics-Derived Morphological Features.,"Background and Purpose- Discrimination of the stability of intracranial aneurysms is critical for determining the treatment strategy, especially in small aneurysms. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of applying machine learning for predicting aneurysm stability with radiomics-derived morphological features. Methods- Morphological features of 719 aneurysms were extracted from PyRadiomics, of which 420 aneurysms with Maximum3DDiameter ranging from 4 mm to 8 mm were enrolled for analysis. The stability of these aneurysms and other clinical characteristics were reviewed from the medical records. Based on the morphologies with/without clinical features, machine learning models were constructed and compared to define the morphological determinants and screen the optimal model for predicting aneurysm stability. The effect of clinical characteristics on the morphology of unstable aneurysms was analyzed. Results- Twelve morphological features were automatically extracted from PyRadiomics implemented in Python for each aneurysm. Lasso regression defined Flatness as the most important morphological feature to predict aneurysm stability, followed by SphericalDisproportion, Maximum2DDiameterSlice, and SurfaceArea. SurfaceArea (odds ratio [OR], 0.697; 95% CI, 0.476-0.998), SphericalDisproportion (OR, 1.730; 95% CI, 1.143-2.658), Flatness (OR, 0.584; 95% CI, 0.374-0.894), Hyperlipemia (OR, 2.410; 95% CI, 1.029-5.721), Multiplicity (OR, 0.182; 95% CI, 0.082-0.380), Location at middle cerebral artery (OR, 0.359; 95% CI, 0.134-0.902), and internal carotid artery (OR, 0.087; 95% CI, 0.030-0.211) were enrolled into the final prediction model. In terms of performance, the area under curve of the model reached 0.853 (95% CI, 0.767-0.940). For unstable aneurysms, Compactness1 ( P=0.035), Compactness2 ( P=0.036), Sphericity ( P=0.035), and Flatness ( P=0.010) were low, whereas SphericalDisproportion ( P=0.034) was higher in patients with hypertension. Conclusions- Morphological features extracted from PyRadiomics can be used for aneurysm stratification. Flatness is the most important morphological determinant to predict aneurysm stability. Our model can be used to predict aneurysm stability. Unstable aneurysm is more irregular in patients with hypertension.",2019,Stroke
Incontinence urinaire de la femme en milieu urbain au Burkina Faso: EnquÃªte Ã©pidemiologique auprÃ¨s de 759 femmes Ã  Bobo Dioulasso,"Objectifs : Determiner la prevalence de l'incontinence urinaire, identifier les facteurs de risque et apprecier les retentissements de cette affection sur la vie des femmes. 
Patientes et methodes : Etude prospective et transversale sur l'incontinence urinaire (UI) de la femme en milieu urbain au Burkina Faso. Il s'agit d'une enquete epidemiologique qui s'est deroulee de janvier 2003 a avril 2003 aupres de 759 femmes se rendant dans quelques formations sanitaires de la ville de Bobo-Dioulasso. 
Resultats : L'age moyen des femmes etait de 29,8 ans, la gestite et la parite moyenne respectivement de 3 et 2,6. La majorite d'entre elles (63,6%) etaient des femmes au foyer dont 65,5% de mariees. La prevalence globale de l'IU etait de 21,3% et l'incontinence urinaire d'effort (IUE) etait le type dominant (54,6%). Concernant les facteurs de risque, seules la dystocie, les in-fections urinaires a repetition, la constipation chronique, l'episiotomie et l'obesite restaient associes significativement a la survenue de l'IU, apres une analyse multivariee utilisant le mode de regression logistique. Le retentissement de l'IU a ete apprecie en terme de cout physique et surtout psychosocial ; le cout economique etant impossible a evaluer dans notre contexte. 
Conclusion : L'incontinence urinaire est frequente dans notre region malgre le peu de cas vus dans les services de gynecologie et d'urologie. Une enquete de ce type realisee en population generale et a l'echelle nationale permettrait de mieux apprecier l'amp-leur du probleme et identifier les elements necessaires a une strategie de prise en charge adequate de cette pathologie. Female Urinary Incontinence in an Urban Area in Burkina Faso: Epidemiological Study of 759 Women in the City of Bobo-Dioulasso 
Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of urinary incontinence, identify its risk factors and describe its effects on the life of women affected by it in an urban area in Burkina Faso. 
Patients and Methods: This prospective study was carried out between January and April 2003 and was based on interviews with 759 female patients presenting to the Department of Urology, Sanou Souro Teaching Hospital, and five other medical centers in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. By means of a questionnaire we collected information on socio-demographic patient characteristics, history of previous surgical or gynecological interventions, type of urine loss and the effects of urinary incontinence on the patients\' physical, psychological and economical condition. 
Results: The mean age of the patients was 29,8 years. The majority (63.6%) were housewives, 65.5% of them married. The overall prevalence of urinary incontinence was 21,3% with a predominance (54,6%) of stress urinary incontinence. Multivariate analysis of the risk factors (using the logistic regression model) showed that the following risk factors were significantly associated with urinary incontinence: dystocia, repeated urinary tract infections, chronic constipation, episiotomy and obesity. The physical and psycho-social effect of urinary incontinence on the patients is described. 
Conclusion: Urinary incontinence is frequently encountered in our environment although only few cases are seen in our gynecology and urology departments. A population-based investigation on a national scale will allow for a better judgment of the actual extent of the problem and will help to establish a strategy on how to better control it.

Moderately clipped LASSO,"The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) has been widely used in high-dimensional linear regression models. However, it is known that the LASSO selects too many noisy variables. In this paper, we propose a new estimator, the moderately clipped LASSO (MCL), that deletes noisy variables successively without sacrificing prediction accuracy much. Various numerical studies are done to illustrate superiority of the MCL over other competitors.",2015,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Predicts Severe Illness Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the Early Stage,"Background: Severe ill patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure. We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence. Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve. Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a c-index of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the NLR had superior standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of severe illness was 9.1% in age â‰¥ 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients, and half of patients with age â‰¥ 50 and NLR â‰¥ 3.13 would develop severe illness. Based on the risk stratification of NLR with age, the study developed a 2019-nCoV pneumonia management process. Conclusions: The NLR was the early identification of risk factors for 2019-nCoV severe illness. Patients with age â‰¥ 50 and NLR â‰¥ 3.13 facilitated severe illness, and they should rapidly access to intensive care unit if necessary.",2020,medRxiv
Assessment of linear regression techniques for modeling multisensor data for non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring,"New scenarios in diabetes treatment have been opened in the last ten years by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors. In particular, Non-Invasive CGM sensors are particularly appealing, even though they are still at an early stage of development. Solianis Monitoring AG (ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland) has proposed an approach based on a multisensor concept, embedding primarily dielectric spectroscopy and optical sensors. This concept requires a mathematical model able to reconstruct the glucose concentration from the 150 channels measured with the device. Assuming a multivariate linear regression model (valid and usable for different individuals), the aim of this paper is the assessment of some techniques usable for determining such a model, namely Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Once the model is identified on a training set, the accuracy of prospective glucose profiles estimated from â€unseenâ€ multisensor data is assessed. Preliminary results obtained from 18 in-clinic study days show that sufficiently accurate reconstruction of glucose levels can be achieved if suitable model identification techniques, such as LASSO, are considered.",2011,2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society
An efficient linearly convergent semismooth Netwon-CG augmented Lagrangian method for Lasso problems,"We develop a fast and robust algorithm for solving large-scale convex composite optimization models with an emphasis on the $\ell_1$-regularized least square regression (the Lasso) problems. Although there exist a large amount of solvers in the literature for Lasso problems, so far no solver can handle difficult real large scale regression problems. By relying on the piecewise linear-quadratic structure of the problems to realize the remarkable fast linear convergence property of the augmented Lagrangian algorithm, and by exploiting the superlinear convergence of the semismooth Newton-CG method, we are able to design a new algorithm, called {\sc Ssnal}, to efficiently solve the aforementioned difficult problems. Global convergence and local linear convergence results for {\sc Ssnal} are established. Numerical results, including the comparison between our approach and several state-of-the-art solvers, on real data sets, are presented to demonstrate the high efficiency and robustness of our proposed algorithm in solving large-scale difficult problems.",2016,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Tree-Guided Group Lasso for Multi-Task Regression with Structured Sparsity,"We consider the problem of learning a sparse multi-task regression, where the structure in the outputs can be represented as a tree with leaf nodes as outputs and internal nodes as clusters of the outputs at multiple granularity. Our goal is to recover the common set of relevant inputs for each output cluster. Assuming that the tree structure is available as prior knowledge, we formulate this problem as a new multi-task regularized regression called tree-guided group lasso. Our structured regularization is based on a group-lasso penalty, where groups are defined with respect to the tree structure. We describe a systematic weighting scheme for the groups in the penalty such that each output variable is penalized in a balanced manner even if the groups overlap. We present an efficient optimization method that can handle a large-scale problem. Using simulated and yeast datasets, we demonstrate that our method shows a superior performance in terms of both prediction errors and recovery of true sparsity patterns compared to other methods for multi-task learning.",2010,
Response shrinkage estimators in binary regression,"A shrinkage type estimator is introduced which has favourable properties in binary regression. The proposed response shrinkage estimator is based on a smoothed version of the observed responses which is obtained by shifting the observation slightly towards the mean of the observations and therefore closer to the underlying probability. Estimates of this type are easily computed by using common program packages. They exist also in cases where the number of variables is large as compared to the number of observations. Comparison to alternative shrinkage methods like ridge regression and LASSO shows that response shrinkage performs rather well. Moreover, a combination of response shrinkage estimators and Pregibon's resistant fitting procedure is considered. The resulting estimate corrects for the overprediction of the resistant fitting in a very simple way. Estimators are compared in simulation studies and applications.",2006,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Optimal estimation of sparse high-dimensional additive models,"In this paper we discuss the estimation of a nonparametric component $f_1$ of a nonparametric additive model $Y=f_1(X_1) + ...+ f_q(X_q) + \varepsilon$. We allow the number $q$ of additive components to grow to infinity and we make sparsity assumptions about the number of nonzero additive components. We compare this estimation problem with that of estimating $f_1$ in the oracle model $Z= f_1(X_1) + \varepsilon$, for which the additive components $f_2,\dots,f_q$ are known. We construct a two-step presmoothing-and-resmoothing estimator of $f_1$ in the additive model and state finite-sample bounds for the difference between our estimator and some smoothing estimators $\tilde f_1^{\text{oracle}}$ in the oracle model which satisfy mild conditions. In an asymptotic setting these bounds can be used to show asymptotic equivalence of our estimator and the oracle estimators; the paper thus shows that, asymptotically, under strong enough sparsity conditions, knowledge of $f_2,\dots,f_q$ has no effect on estimation efficiency. Our first step is to estimate all of the components in the additive model with undersmoothing using a group-Lasso estimator. We then construct pseudo responses $\hat Y$ by evaluating a desparsified modification of our undersmoothed estimator of $f_1$ at the design points. In the second step the smoothing method of the oracle estimator $\tilde f_1^{\text{oracle}}$ is applied to a nonparametric regression problem with ""responses"" $\hat Y$ and covariates $X_1$. Our mathematical exposition centers primarily on establishing properties of the presmoothing estimator. We also present simulation results demonstrating close-to-oracle performance of our estimator in practical applications. The main results of the paper are also important for understanding the behavior of the presmoothing estimator when the resmoothing step is omitted.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Covariance-regularized regression and classification for high-dimensional problems.,"In recent years, many methods have been developed for regression in high-dimensional settings. We propose covariance-regularized regression, a family of methods that use a shrunken estimate of the inverse covariance matrix of the features in order to achieve superior prediction. An estimate of the inverse covariance matrix is obtained by maximizing its log likelihood, under a multivariate normal model, subject to a constraint on its elements; this estimate is then used to estimate coefficients for the regression of the response onto the features. We show that ridge regression, the lasso, and the elastic net are special cases of covariance-regularized regression, and we demonstrate that certain previously unexplored forms of covariance-regularized regression can outperform existing methods in a range of situations. The covariance-regularized regression framework is extended to generalized linear models and linear discriminant analysis, and is used to analyze gene expression data sets with multiple class and survival outcomes.",2009,"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
