MÃ¡s-o-menos: a simple sign averaging method for discrimination in genomic data analysis,"MOTIVATION
The successful translation of genomic signatures into clinical settings relies on good discrimination between patient subgroups. Many sophisticated algorithms have been proposed in the statistics and machine learning literature, but in practice simpler algorithms are often used. However, few simple algorithms have been formally described or systematically investigated.


RESULTS
We give a precise definition of a popular simple method we refer to as mÃ¡s-o-menos, which calculates prognostic scores for discrimination by summing standardized predictors, weighted by the signs of their marginal associations with the outcome. We study its behavior theoretically, in simulations and in an extensive analysis of 27 independent gene expression studies of bladder, breast and ovarian cancer, altogether totaling 3833 patients with survival outcomes. We find that despite its simplicity, mÃ¡s-o-menos can achieve good discrimination performance. It performs no worse, and sometimes better, than popular and much more CPU-intensive methods for discrimination, including lasso and ridge regression.


AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION
MÃ¡s-o-menos is implemented for survival analysis as an option in the survHD package, available from http://www.bitbucket.org/lwaldron/survhd and submitted to Bioconductor.",2014,Bioinformatics
Asymptotic Analysis of Robust LASSOs in the Presence of Noise With Large Variance,"In the context of linear regression, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is probably the most popular supervised-learning technique proposed to recover sparse signals from high-dimensional measurements. Prior literature has mainly concerned itself with independent, identically distributed noise with moderate variance. In many real applications, however, the measurement errors may have heavy-tailed distributions or suffer from severe outliers, making the LASSO poorly estimate the coefficients due to its sensitivity to large error variance. To address this concern, a robust version of the LASSO is proposed, and the limiting distribution of its estimator is derived. Model selection consistency is established for the proposed robust LASSO under an adaptation procedure of the penalty weight. A parallel asymptotic analysis is derived for the Huberized LASSO, a previously proposed robust LASSO, and it is shown that the Huberized LASSO estimator preserves similar asymptotics even with a Cauchy error distribution. We show that asymptotic variances of the two robust LASSO estimators are stabilized in the presence of large variance noise, compared with the unbounded asymptotic variance of the ordinary LASSO estimator. The asymptotic analysis from the nonstochastic design is extended to the case of random design. Simulations further confirm our theoretical results.",2010,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
Weighted Lasso Subsampling for HighDimensional Regression,"Lasso regression methods are widely used for a number of scientic applications.Many practitioners of statistics were not aware that a small changein the data would results in unstable Lasso solution path. For instance, inthe presence of outlying observations, Lasso perhaps leads the increase inthe percentage of the false selection rate of predictors. On the other hand,the discussions on determining an optimal shrinkage parameter of Lasso isstill ongoing. Therefore, this paper proposed a robust algorithm to tacklethe instability of Lasso in the presence of outliers. A new weight function isproposed to overcome the problem of outlying observations. The weightedobservations are subsamples for a certain number of subsamples to controlthe false Lasso selection. The simulation study has been carried out and usesreal data to assess the performance of our proposed algorithm. Consequently,the proposed method shows more eciency than LAD-Lasso and weightedLAD-Lasso and more reliable results.",2019,Electronic Journal of Applied Statistical Analysis
"Predictive Modelling to Study the Electrochemical Behaviour of PdO, TiO2 and Perovskite-Type LaFeO3 Modified Carbon Paste Electrodes","Transition metals are highly sought after in electrode construction due their eventual electrocatalytic effects. In this context, this work presents the study of several metal oxide modified electrodes focusing in the evaluation of their electrochemical features through voltammetry and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Moreover, a predictive statistical model was also developed using LASSO regression. Henceforth, glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and carbon paste electrode (CPE) were used to establish correlations between the herein studied modifications, namely: PdO@CPE, TiO 2 @CPE and LaFeO 3 @CPE. Results evidence that metal oxide modified electrodes may increase signal detection through electrocatalytic effects, however the herein developed model evidenced that surface area plays a major role in electrode response through voltammetry.",2019,Path of Science
A protein level signature of four selected genes associated with survival outcomes of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,"Abstract Background Compared with quantification of messenger RNA, a protein level quantification allows for more relevant clinical outcome predictions and the identification of potential therapeutic targets. The aim of this study was to identify a novel protein level signature that was associated with overall survival in patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Methods Data of 105 patients with resected PDAC were retrieved from TRGAted. Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) quantification data of 218 proteins were collected. By using the LASSO regression model, a protein-level-based classifier was built. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the prognostic accuracy of the classifier. Survival curves were compared by using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results Using the LASSO model, we built a classifier based on four proteins: BAK, IGFBP2, PDL1, and BRAF-pS445. Survival analysis revealed IGFBP2 and BRAF-pS445 were two favourable prognostic markers, and BAK and PDL1 were unfavourable prognostic markers. Using the classifier, we were able to classify patients between those at high risk of disease progression (high-risk group) and those at low risk of disease progression (low-risk group). Progression-free survival was significantly different between these two groups (11.7 vs 19.9 months for high-risk and low-risk groups, respectively; PÂ  Conclusions This protein-level classifier is a novel prognostic tool in patients with resected PDAC. It may facilitate individualized management of patients with this disease. Legal entity responsible for the study Jie Hua.

Evaluation of Genomic Prediction Methods for Fusarium Head Blight Resistance in Wheat,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance is quantitative and diffi cult to evaluate. Genomic selection (GS) could accelerate FHB resistance breeding. We used U.S. cooperative FHB wheat nursery data to evaluate GS models for several FHB resistance traits including deoxynivalenol (DON) levels. For all traits we compared the models: ridge regression (RR), Bayesian LASSO (BL), reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) regression, random forest (RF) regression, and multiple linear regression (MLR) (fi xed effects). For DON, we evaluated additional prediction methods including bivariate RR models, phenotypes for correlated traits, and RF regression models combining markers and correlated phenotypes as predictors. Additionally, for all traits, we compared different marker sets including genomewide markers, FHB quantitative trait loci (QTL) targeted markers, and both sets combined. Genomic selection accuracies were always higher than MLR accuracies, RF and RKHS regression were often the most accurate methods, and for DON, marker plus trait RF regression was more accurate than all other methods. For all traits except DON, using QTL targeted markers alone led to lower accuracies than using genomewide markers. This study indicates that cooperative FHB nursery data can be useful for GS, and prior information about correlated traits and QTL could be used to improve accuracies in some cases.",2012,The Plant Genome
Case influence diagnostics in the lasso regression,"Abstract Using the diagnostic results in the ridge regression model, we propose an approximate version of Cookâ€™s distance in the lasso regression model since the analytic expression of the lasso estimator is not available. Also, we express the proposed Cookâ€™s distance in terms of basic building blocks such as residuals and leverages. We verify that the proposed statistic successfully detects potentially influential observations on estimators of regression coefficients and on the model selection in the lasso regression model. An illustrative example based on a real dataset is given.",2015,Journal of The Korean Statistical Society
ConvexLAR: An Extension of Least Angle Regression.,"The least angle regression (LAR) was proposed by Efron, Hastie, Johnstone and Tibshirani (2004) for continuous model selection in linear regression. It is motivated by a geometric argument and tracks a path along which the predictors enter successively and the active predictors always maintain the same absolute correlation (angle) with the residual vector. Although it gains popularity quickly, its extensions seem rare compared to the penalty methods. In this expository article, we show that the powerful geometric idea of LAR can be generalized in a fruitful way. We propose a ConvexLAR algorithm that works for any convex loss function and naturally extends to group selection and data adaptive variable selection. After simple modification it also yields new exact path algorithms for certain penalty methods such as a convex loss function with lasso or group lasso penalty. Variable selection in recurrent event and panel count data analysis, Ada-Boost, and Gaussian graphical model is reconsidered from the ConvexLAR angle.",2015,"Journal of computational and graphical statistics : a joint publication of American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Interface Foundation of North America"
The vulnerability of men to virologic failure during antiretroviral therapy in a public routine clinic in Burkina Faso,"INTRODUCTION
Gender differences in antiretroviral therapy (ART) outcomes are critical in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the association between gender and virologic failure among adult patients treated in a public routine clinic (one of the largest in West Africa) in Burkina Faso.


METHODS
We performed a case-control study between July and October 2012 among patients who had received ART at the Bobo Dioulasso Day Care Unit. Patients were eligible if they were 15 years or older, positive for HIV-1 or HIV-1+2, and on first-line ART for at least six months. Cases were all patients with two consecutive HIV loads >1000 copies/mL (Biocentric Generic or Abbott Real Time assays), or one HIV load >1000 copies/mL associated with immunologic or clinical failure criteria. Controls were all patients who only had HIV loads <300 copies/mL. The association between gender and virologic failure was assessed using a multivariate logistic regression, adjusted on age, level of education, baseline CD4+ T cell count, first and current antiretroviral regimens and time on ART.


RESULTS
Of 2303 patients (74.2% women; median age: 40 years; median time on ART: 34 months), 172 had virologic failure and 2131 had virologic success. Among the former, 130 (75.6%) had confirmed virologic failure, 38 (22.1%) had viro-immunologic failure, and four (2.3%) had viro-clinical failure. The proportion of men was significantly higher among the cases than among the controls (37.2% vs. 24.9%; p<0.001). Compared to controls, cases were also younger, more immunodeficient at ART initiation, less likely to receive a protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimen and had spent a longer period of time on ART. After adjustment, male gender remained strongly associated with virologic failure (odds ratio 2.52, 95% CI: 1.77-3.60; p<0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Men on ART appeared more vulnerable to virologic failure than women. Additional studies are needed to confirm the poorer prognosis of men in this setting and to determine the causes for their vulnerability in order to optimize HIV care. From now on, efforts should be made to support the adherence of men to ART in the African setting.",2014,Journal of the International AIDS Society
Online Homotopy Algorithm for a Generalization of the LASSO,"The LASSO is a widely used shrinkage method for linear regression. We propose an online homotopy algorithm to solve a generalization of the LASSO in which the l1 regularization is applied on a linear transformation of the solution, allowing to input prior information on the structure of the problem and to improve interpretability of the results. The algorithm takes advantage of the sparsity of the solution for computational efficiency and is promising for mining large datasets.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control
Finding the balance between model complexity and performance: Using ventral striatal oscillations to classify feeding behavior in rats,"The ventral striatum (VS) is a central node within a distributed network that controls appetitive behavior, and neuromodulation of the VS has demonstrated therapeutic potential for appetitive disorders. Local field potential (LFP) oscillations recorded from deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes within the VS are a pragmatic source of neural systems-level information about appetitive behavior that could be used in responsive neuromodulation systems. Here, we recorded LFPs from the bilateral nucleus accumbens core and shell (subregions of the VS) during limited access to palatable food across varying conditions of hunger and food palatability in male rats. We used standard statistical methods (logistic regression) as well as the machine learning algorithm lasso to predict aspects of feeding behavior using VS LFPs. We were able to predict the amount of food eaten, the increase in consumption following food deprivation, and the type of food eaten. Further, we were able to predict whether the initiation of feeding was imminent up to 42.5 seconds before feeding began and classify current behavior as either feeding or not-feeding. In classifying feeding behavior, we found an optimal balance between model complexity and performance with models using 3 LFP features primarily from the alpha and high gamma frequencies. As shown here, unbiased methods can identify systems-level neural activity linked to domains of mental illness with potential application to the development and personalization of novel treatments.",2019,PLoS Computational Biology
Regularized M-estimators with nonconvexity: statistical and algorithmic theory for local optima,"We provide novel theoretical results regarding local optima of regularized $M$-estimators, allowing for nonconvexity in both loss and penalty functions. Under restricted strong convexity on the loss and suitable regularity conditions on the penalty, we prove that \emph{any stationary point} of the composite objective function will lie within statistical precision of the underlying parameter vector. Our theory covers many nonconvex objective functions of interest, including the corrected Lasso for errors-in-variables linear models; regression for generalized linear models with nonconvex penalties such as SCAD, MCP, and capped-$\ell_1$; and high-dimensional graphical model estimation. We quantify statistical accuracy by providing bounds on the $\ell_1$-, $\ell_2$-, and prediction error between stationary points and the population-level optimum. We also propose a simple modification of composite gradient descent that may be used to obtain a near-global optimum within statistical precision $\epsilon$ in $\log(1/\epsilon)$ steps, which is the fastest possible rate of any first-order method. We provide simulation studies illustrating the sharpness of our theoretical results.",2015,
Regularization Parameter Selection for a Bayesian Multi-Level Group Lasso Regression Model with Application to Imaging Genomics,"We investigate the choice of tuning parameters for a Bayesian multi-level group lasso model developed for the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetic data. The regression model we consider relates multivariate phenotypes consisting of brain summary measures (volumetric and cortical thickness values) to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) data and imposes penalization at two nested levels, the first corresponding to genes and the second corresponding to SNPs. Associated with each level in the penalty is a tuning parameter which corresponds to a hyperparameter in the hierarchical Bayesian formulation. Following previous work on Bayesian lassos we consider the estimation of tuning parameters through either hierarchical Bayes based on hyperpriors and Gibbs sampling or through empirical Bayes based on maximizing the marginal likelihood using a Monte Carlo EM algorithm. For the specific model under consideration we find that these approaches can lead to severe overshrinkage of the regression parameter estimates in the high-dimensional setting or when the genetic effects are weak. We demonstrate these problems through simulation examples and study an approximation to the marginal likelihood which sheds light on the cause of this problem. We then suggest an alternative approach based on the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC), an asymptotic approximation to leave-one-out cross-validation that can be computed conveniently within an MCMC framework.",2016,arXiv: Machine Learning
Model Geographically Weighted Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Gw-Lasso) pada Data Penderita Diare di Indonesia,"AbstrakDiare merupakan penyumbang utama angka kesakitan dan kematian pada anak di berbagai negara. Indonesia termasuk 15 negara teratas dengan jumlah penderita diare terbanyak. Menurut KEMENKES RI, case fatality rate (CFR) akibat diare pada tahun 2016 mengalami kenaikan sebesar 3,04%. Enam faktor yang diduga memengaruhi persentase penderita diare adalah persentase penduduk miskin, persentase dokter, persentase rumah tangga yang memiliki jamban, persentase sumber air minum berasal dari air tanah, persentase rumah sakit, dan persentase puskesmas. Pengaruh dari faktor-faktor tersebut ditentukan menggunakan model regresi. Perbedaan karakteristik antar wilayah berakibat adanya kasus KLB yang terjadi di beberapa provinsi. Terdapat variasi antar lokasi disebut heterogenitas spasial sehingga dapat digunakan model geographically weighted regression (GWR). Estimasi parameter pada GWR menggunakan metode kuadarat terkecil terboboti atau weighted least square (WLS). Fungsi pembobot yang digunakan adalah fungsi pembobot kernel Gaussian yang memberikan pembobot sesuai bandwidth optimum yang nilainya diperoleh dari cross validation (CV). Penambahan fungsi pembobot mengakibatkan korelasi antar variabel meningkat sehingga diindikasikan terdapat multikolinearitas pada model GWR. Multikolinearitas merupakan kondisi terdapatnya korelasi antara variabel prediktor sehingga mengakibatkan hasil estimasi parameter memiliki variansi yang besar. Dalam kasus ini GWR tidak dapat mengatasi masalah multikolinieritas. Metode untuk mengatasi masalah multikolinearitas adalah least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). LASSO melakukan estimasi dengan algoritme least angle regression (LARS) yang menyusutkan estimasi parameter sampai ke nol menggunakan parameter penyusutan (shrinkage) (s). Nilai parameter shrinkage ditentukan melalui cross validation (CV). Metode LASSO yang diaplikasikan pada model GWR yang dikenal dengan istilah geographically weighted LASSO (GW-LASSO).

Prise en compte des groupes de biomarqueurs ou des voies biologiques dans les modÃ¨les de Cox pÃ©nalisÃ©s de haute dimension,"Problematique Le developpement de technologies genomiques a haut debit a permis la croissance rapide et la disponibilite plus facile de tres grandes donnees genomiques. Le modele a risques proportionnels de Cox est couramment utilise pour estimer lâ€™effet dâ€™un ou de plusieurs facteurs pronostiques pour des criteres de jugement de type survie. La methode de regression penalisee Lasso est utilisee pour selectionner des biomarqueurs dans des donnees de haute dimension, mais cette methode ne prend pas en compte les connaissances des roles biologiques des biomarqueurs, par exemple les voies biologiques (Â«Â pathwaysÂ Â») connues. Methodologie Nous presentons differentes penalisations pour que le modele de Cox selectionne correctement les biomarqueurs groupes afin de favoriser la selection de biomarqueurs pronostiques (actifs) qui, en plus dâ€™avoir un effet individuel important, appartiennent a un groupe actif.

Opportunities and challenges of regression analysis for big data are investigated in the present article. Firstly, the main characteristics describing big data are identified and explained, and then potential challenges that arise in big data analytics are identified. According to the identified challenges, some methods used in the regression analysis for big data are proposed. These methods reduce the calculation burden and select variables that best describe the response variable, thus achieving sufficient statisti-cal accuracy and reducing costs and time of calculations. One of the main purposes of this article is to apply the methods for real data set. Simulation and real data regression models are formed and parameters are estimated using divided regression and regression based on leverage techniques. The LASSO and LARS regressions are used to select the best subset of variables. Finally, model diag-nostics, accuracy estimation and comparisons of results are performed.",2018,
Genomic risk scores for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and its subtypes,"Aims: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune disease and a common cause of chronic disability in children. Diagnosis of JIA is based purely on clinical symptoms, leading to treatment delays. Despite JIA having substantial heritability, the construction of genomic risk scores (GRSs) to aid or expedite diagnosis has not been assessed. Here, we generate GRSs for JIA and its subtypes and evaluate their performance. Methods: We examined three case/control cohorts (UK, US, and Australia) with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes. We trained GRSs for JIA and its subtypes using lasso-penalised linear models in cross-validation on the UK cohort, and externally tested in the Australian and US cohorts. Results: The JIA GRS alone achieved cross-validated AUC=0.670 in the UK cohort and externally validated AUCs of 0.657 and 0.671 in US-based and Australian cohorts, respectively. In logistic regression of case/control status, the corresponding odds ratios per standard deviation (s.d.) of GRS were 1.831 [1.685-1.991] and 2.008 [1.731-2.345], and were unattenuated by adjustment for sex or the top 10 genetic principal components. Extending our analysis to JIA subtypes revealed that enthesitis-related JIA had both the longest time-to-referral and the subtype GRS with the strongest predictive capacity overall across datasets: AUCs 0.80 in UK; 0.83 Australian; 0.69 US-based. The particularly common oligoarthritis JIA subtype also had a subtype GRS outperformed those for JIA overall, with AUCs of 0.71, 0.75 and 0.77, respectively. Conclusions: A genomic risk score for JIA has potential to augment purely clinical JIA diagnosis protocols, prioritising higher-risk individuals for follow-up and treatment. Consistent with JIA heterogeneity, subtype-specific GRSs showed particularly high performance for enthesitis-related and oligoarthritis JIA.",2020,medRxiv
Development and Validation of a Five-Gene Model to Predict Postoperative Brain Metastasis in Operable Lung Adenocarcinoma.,"One of the most common sites of extra-thoracic distant metastasis of non-small-cell lung cancer is the brain. This study was performed to discover genes associated with postoperative brain metastasis in operable lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). RNA seq was performed in specimens of primary LUAD from seven patients with brain metastases and 45 patients without recurrence. Immunohistochemical (IHC) assays of the differentially-expressed genes were conducted in 272 surgical-resected LUAD specimens. LASSO Cox regression was used to filter genes related to brain metastasis and construct brain metastasis score (BMS). GSE31210 and GSE50081 were used as validation datasets of the model. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed in patients stratified by risk of brain metastasis in the TCGA database. Through the initial screening, eight genes (CDK1, KPNA2, KIF11, ASPM, CEP55, HJURP, TYMS, and TTK) were selected for IHC analyses. The BMS based on protein expression levels of five genes (TYMS, CDK1, HJURP, CEP55, and KIF11) was highly predictive of brain metastasis in our cohort (12-month AUC: 0.791, 36-month AUC: 0.766, 60-month AUC: 0.812). The validation of BMS on overall survival of GSE31210 and GSE50081 also showed excellent predictive value (GSE31210, 12-month AUC: 0.682, 36-month AUC: 0.713, 60-month AUC: 0.762; GSE50081, 12-month AUC: 0.706, 36-month AUC: 0.700, 60-month AUC: 0.724). Further analyses showed high BMS was associated with pathways of cell cycle and DNA repair. A 5-gene predictive model exhibits potential clinical utility for the prediction of postoperative brain metastasis and the individual management of patients with LUAD after radical resection.

Regression adjustment for treatment effect with multicollinearity in high dimensions,"Randomized experiment is an important tool for studying the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). This paper considers the regression adjustment estimation of the Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE) in high-dimensional case, where the multicollinearity problem is often encountered and needs to be properly handled. Many existing regression adjustment methods fail to achieve satisfactory performances. To solve this issue, an Elastic-net adjusted estimator for SATE is proposed under the Rubin causal model of randomized experiments with multicollinearity in high dimensions. The asymptotic properties of the proposed SATE estimator are shown under some regularity conditions, and the asymptotic variance is proved to be not greater than that of the unadjusted estimator. Furthermore, Neyman-type conservative estimators for the asymptotic variance are proposed, which yields tighter confidence intervals than both the unadjusted and the Lasso-based adjusted estimators. Some simulation studies are carried out to show that the Elastic-net adjusted method is better in addressing collinearity problem than the existing methods. The advantages of our proposed method are also shown in analyzing the dataset of HER2 breast cancer patients.",2019,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
MRI radiomic features are associated with survival in melanoma brain metastases treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.,"BACKGROUND
Melanoma brain metastases historically portend a dismal prognosis, but recent advances in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been associated with durable responses in some patients. There are no validated imaging biomarkers associated with outcomes in patients with melanoma brain metastases receiving ICIs. We hypothesized that radiomic analysis of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) could identify higher-order features associated with survival.


METHODS
Between 2010 and 2019, we retrospectively reviewed patients with melanoma brain metastases who received ICI. After volumes of interest were drawn, several texture and edge descriptors, including first-order, Haralick, Gabor, Sobel, and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) features were extracted. Progression was determined using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases. Univariate Cox regression was performed for each radiomic feature with adjustment for multiple comparisons followed by Lasso regression and multivariate analysis.


RESULTS
Eighty-eight patients with 196 total brain metastases were identified. Median age was 63.5 years (range, 19-91 y). Ninety percent of patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Sixty-three patients (72%) received ipilimumab, 11 patients (13%) received programmed cell death protein 1 blockade, and 14 patients (16%) received nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Multiple features were associated with increased overall survival (OS), and LoG edge features best explained the variation in outcome (hazard ratio: 0.68, P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, a similar trend with LoG was seen, but no longer significant with OS. Findings were confirmed in an independent cohort.


CONCLUSION
Higher-order MRI radiomic features in patients with melanoma brain metastases receiving ICI were associated with a trend toward improved OS.",2019,Neuro-oncology
Variable Selection for Censored Quantile Regresion.,"Quantile regression has emerged as a powerful tool in survival analysis as it directly links the quantiles of patients' survival times to their demographic and genomic profiles, facilitating the identification of important prognostic factors. In view of limited work on variable selection in the context, we develop a new adaptive-lasso-based variable selection procedure for quantile regression with censored outcomes. To account for random censoring for data with multivariate covariates, we employ the ideas of redistribution-of-mass and e ective dimension reduction. Asymptotically our procedure enjoys the model selection consistency, that is, identifying the true model with probability tending to one. Moreover, as opposed to the existing methods, our new proposal requires fewer assumptions, leading to more accurate variable selection. The analysis of a real cancer clinical trial demonstrates that our procedure can identify and distinguish important factors associated with patient sub-populations characterized by short or long survivals, which is of particular interest to oncologists.",2013,Statistica Sinica
Analysis of Spectral Clustering and the Lasso under Nonstandard Statistical Models,"Advances in information technology have provided businesses, governments, and the sciences novel tools to collect and store data. These new technologies produce data that does not always fit within the classical statistical paradigm: several independent and identically distributed samples from a distribution with a few parameters. Instead, the modern data sources often contain dependent samples, with several agents that interact, e.g. social networks. In some situations, the number of parameters far exceeds the number of samples, e.g. experiments with fMRI. To create knowledge from these new data sources requires fresh statistical tools and novel theoretical insights. This dissertation uses nonstandard statistical models to study the theoretical properties of three estimators that confront two modern types of data, network data and high dimensional data. Networks or graphs can easily represent a diverse set of data sources that are characterized by interacting units or actors. Social networks, representing people who communicate with each other, are one example. Communities or clusters of highly connected actors form an essential feature in the structure of several empirical networks. Spectral clustering is a popular and computationally feasible method to discover these communities in undirected networks. Chapter 2 uses the Stochastic Blockmodel [Holland et al., 1983], a social network model with well defined communities, to study the estimation properties of the spectral clustering algorithm. For a network generated from the Stochastic Blockmodel, we bound the number of nodes ``misclustered by spectral clustering. The asymptotic results in Chapter 2 are the first clustering results that allow the number of clusters in the model to grow with the number of nodes, hence the name high-dimensional. Chapter 2 addresses clustering in undirected networks, where relationships do not have a direction. However, in some networks, such as the predator-prey network, relationships point from one actor to another (e.g. from predator to prey). Chapter 3 extends the spectral clustering algorithm and the Stochastic Blockmodel to directed graphs. The new algorithm, Di-Sim (pronounced ``dice `em ) produces two distinct types of clusters, one corresponding to incoming edges and another corresponding to outgoing edges. The new Directed Stochastic Blockmodel provides a test bed to conceptualize these two types of clusters. This new model also allows for a theoretical investigation of Di-Sim's asymptotic properties. While directed spectral clustering is not derived from this model, it is shown that, asymptotically, the algorithm can estimate the blocks in the directed Stochastic Blockmodel.Finally, Chapter 4 investigates the sign consistency of the Lasso under a heteroskedastic, ``Poisson-like regression model. The performance of the Lasso is well understood under the assumptions of the standard linear model with homoscedastic noise. However, in several applications, the standard model does not describe the important features of the data. Chapter 4 examines how the Lasso performs on a non-standard model that is motivated by medical imaging applications. In these applications, the variance of the noise scales linearly with the expectation of the observation. Like all heteroscedastic models, the noise terms in this Poisson-like model are not independent of the design matrix.",2011,
Estimating High-Dimensional Regression Models with Bootstrap Group Penalties,"Currently many research problems are addressed by analysing datasets characterized by a huge number of variables, with a relatively limited number of observations, especially when data are generated by experimentation. Most of the classical statistical procedures for regression analysis are often inadequate to deal with such datasets as they have been developed assuming that the number of observations is larger than the number of the variables. In this work, we propose a new penalization procedure for variable selection in regression models based on Bootstrap group Penalties (BgP). This new family of penalization methods extends the bootstrap version of the LASSO approach by taking into account the grouping structure that may be present or introduced in the model. We develop a simulation study to compare the performance of this new approach with respect several existing group penalization methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and variable selection quality. The results achieved in this study show that the new procedure outperforms the other penalties procedures considered.",2017,
Reward-related neural activity and structure predict future substance use in dysregulated youth.,"BACKGROUND
Identifying youth who may engage in future substance use could facilitate early identification of substance use disorder vulnerability. We aimed to identify biomarkers that predicted future substance use in psychiatrically un-well youth.


METHOD
LASSO regression for variable selection was used to predict substance use 24.3 months after neuroimaging assessment in 73 behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth aged 13.9 (s.d. = 2.0) years, 30 female, from three clinical sites in the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study. Predictor variables included neural activity during a reward task, cortical thickness, and clinical and demographic variables.


RESULTS
Future substance use was associated with higher left middle prefrontal cortex activity, lower left ventral anterior insula activity, thicker caudal anterior cingulate cortex, higher depression and lower mania scores, not using antipsychotic medication, more parental stress, older age. This combination of variables explained 60.4% of the variance in future substance use, and accurately classified 83.6%.


CONCLUSIONS
These variables explained a large proportion of the variance, were useful classifiers of future substance use, and showed the value of combining multiple domains to provide a comprehensive understanding of substance use development. This may be a step toward identifying neural measures that can identify future substance use disorder risk, and act as targets for therapeutic interventions.",2017,Psychological medicine
Soft Tissue Sarcomas: Preoperative Predictive Histopathological Grading Based on Radiomics of MRI.,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this study is to develop a radiomics model for predicting the histopathological grades of soft tissue sarcomas preoperatively through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Thirty-five patients who were pathologically diagnosed with soft tissue sarcomas and their histological grades were recruited. All patients had undergone MRI before surgery on a 3.0T MRI scanner. Radiomics features were extracted from fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging. We used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method to select features. Then three machine learning classification methods, including random forests, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine algorithm were trained using the 5-fold cross validation strategy to separate the soft tissue sarcomas with low- and high-histopathological grades.


RESULTS
The radiomics features were significantly associated with the histopathological grades. Quantitative imaging features (nâ€¯=â€¯1049) were extracted from fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging, and five features were selected to construct the radiomics model. The model that used support vector machine classification method achieved the best performance among the three methods, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves Area Under Curve (AUC) values of 0.92 Â± 0.07, accuracy of 0.88.


CONCLUSION
Good accuracy and AUC could be obtained using only five radiomic features. Therefore, we proposed that three-dimensional imaging features from fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging could be used as candidate biomarkers for preoperative prediction of histopathological grades of soft tissue sarcomas noninvasively.",2018,Academic radiology
IMRT QA using machine learning: A multiâ€institutional validation,"PURPOSE
To validate a machine learning approach to Virtual intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) quality assurance (QA) for accurately predicting gamma passing rates using different measurement approaches at different institutions.


METHODS
A Virtual IMRT QA framework was previously developed using a machine learning algorithm based on 498 IMRT plans, in which QA measurements were performed using diode-array detectors and a 3%local/3 mm with 10% threshold at Institution 1. An independent set of 139 IMRT measurements from a different institution, Institution 2, with QA data based on portal dosimetry using the same gamma index, was used to test the mathematical framework. Only pixels with â‰¥10% of the maximum calibrated units (CU) or dose were included in the comparison. Plans were characterized by 90 different complexity metrics. A weighted poison regression with Lasso regularization was trained to predict passing rates using the complexity metrics as input.


RESULTS
The methodology predicted passing rates within 3% accuracy for all composite plans measured using diode-array detectors at Institution 1, and within 3.5% for 120 of 139 plans using portal dosimetry measurements performed on a per-beam basis at Institution 2. The remaining measurements (19) had large areas of low CU, where portal dosimetry has a larger disagreement with the calculated dose and as such, the failure was expected. These beams need further modeling in the treatment planning system to correct the under-response in low-dose regions. Important features selected by Lasso to predict gamma passing rates were as follows: complete irradiated area outline (CIAO), jaw position, fraction of MLC leafs with gaps smaller than 20 or 5 mm, fraction of area receiving less than 50% of the total CU, fraction of the area receiving dose from penumbra, weighted average irregularity factor, and duty cycle.


CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated that Virtual IMRT QA can predict passing rates using different measurement techniques and across multiple institutions. Prediction of QA passing rates can have profound implications on the current IMRT process.",2017,Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics
Fully Bayesian logistic regression with hyper-LASSO priors for high-dimensional feature selection,"ABSTRACT Feature selection arises in many areas of modern science. For example, in genomic research, we want to find the genes that can be used to separate tissues of different classes (e.g. cancer and normal). One approach is to fit regression/classification models with certain penalization. In the past decade, hyper-LASSO penalization (priors) have received increasing attention in the literature. However, fully Bayesian methods that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for regression/classification with hyper-LASSO priors are still in lack of development. In this paper, we introduce an MCMC method for learning multinomial logistic regression with hyper-LASSO priors. Our MCMC algorithm uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in a restricted Gibbs sampling framework. We have used simulation studies and real data to demonstrate the superior performance of hyper-LASSO priors compared to LASSO, and to investigate the issues of choosing heaviness and scale of hyper-LASSO priors.",2014,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
