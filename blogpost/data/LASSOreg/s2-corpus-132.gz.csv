Multiple Equivalent Solutions for the Lasso.,"Feature selection is an important problem studied in data analytics seeking to identify a minimal-size feature subset that is optimally predictive for an outcome of interest. It is also a powerful tool in Knowledge Discovery as a means for gaining domain insight, e.g., identifying which medical quantities carry unique information for the disease status. It is arguably less recognized however, that the problem may have multiple, equivalent solutions. In that case, it is misleading to domain experts to report only one of them and ignore all other equivalent solutions. In this paper, we extend a well-established single, feature selection algorithm (i.e., reporting a single solution), namely the Lasso algorithm, to the multiple solution problem based on formalized notion of equivalence for both classification and regression tasks. Empirical results are obtained using a fully automated pipeline called Just Add Data Bio or JAD Bio training and selecting multiple, linear as well as nonlinear learners, optimizing hyper-parameter values, and correcting for the bias of multiple inductions (model selection). The results show that multiple solutions do exist in real datasets, as well as the ability of the algorithm to identify a subset of them. A comparison with the Statistical Equivalent Solutions (SES) algorithm shows that Lasso equivalent solutions have better prediction performance at the cost of selecting more features.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory
DualitÃ©s de forme de pratique fÃ©minine de ski et de consommation de matÃ©riel de glisse,"Lâ€™objectif de cet article est dâ€™ameliorer la connaissance de la pratiquante de ski alpin et de ses logiques de consommation de materiel de glisse. Quelques questions simples peuvent schematiser notre reflexionÂ : Qui est la pratiquante de skiÂ ? Que fait-elle sur les planchesÂ ? Comment achete-t-elle son materiel de glisseÂ ? Sa consommation est-elle influencee par sa position sociale et sa modalite de pratiqueÂ ? Ces questions seront etudiees dans le cadre des theories sociologiques des pratiques sportives et de la consommation. La methodologie repose sur un sondage (n=318) par questionnaire en station de sports dâ€™hiver. On repere deux dimensions-profils de pratiquantesÂ : lâ€™une majoritaire, que nous avons qualifiee de Â«Â jouisseuseÂ Â», a la recherche de convivialite, de detente et de contemplation, lâ€™autre minoritaire, que nous avons appelee Â«Â performeuseÂ Â» et dont la pratique repond a une depense dâ€™energie, une prise de risque et un souci technique. Paradoxalement, câ€™est ce second profil que visent prioritairement les marques dans leur communication. En ce qui concerne le materiel de glisse, la segmentation du marche entre location (70%) et achat (30%) conduit a des criteres de choix communs dâ€™abord centres sur une technologie adaptee aux femmes, facile a skier, legere, mais qui se differencient en demandant un rapport qualite/prix avantageux chez les acheteuses alors que les loueuses avouent aussi un Â«Â choix par defautÂ Â». Ce dernier renvoie au role essentiel du conseilleur loueur ou vendeur et aux repercussions manageriales que cela implique. Les criteres esthetiques souvent evoques pour la consommation feminine ne sont pas mis en avant ici. La segmentation acheteuse versus loueuse est operee par la technique statistique innovante de la regression logistique avec lasso qui releve dâ€™abord des elements spatiaux et temporels de la sociodemographie et des formes de pratiques et, secondairement, motivationnels. Enfin, les deux profils de pratiquantes seront relies a leurs formes de pratique et modes de consommation.",2012,Management & Avenir
Sparse Additive Interaction Learning,"A conceptual paradigm for onset of a new disease is often considered to be the result of changes in entire biological networks whose states are affected by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. However, when modelling a relevant phenotype as a function of high dimensional measurements, power to estimate interactions is low, the number of possible interactions could be enormous and their effects may be non-linear. Existing approaches for high dimensional modelling such as the lasso might keep an interaction but remove a main effect, which is problematic for interpretation. In this work, we introduce a method called sail for detecting non-linear interactions with a key environmental or exposure variable in high-dimensional settings which respects either the strong or weak heredity constraints. We prove that asymptotically, our method possesses the oracle property, i.e., it performs as well as if the true model were known in advance. We develop a computationally efficient fitting algorithm with automatic tuning parameter selection, which scales to high-dimensional datasets. Through an extensive simulation study, we show that sail outperforms existing penalized regression methods in terms of prediction accuracy and support recovery when there are non-linear interactions with an exposure variable. We then apply sail to detect non-linear interactions between genes and a prenatal psychosocial intervention program on cognitive performance in children at 4 years of age. Results from our method show that individuals who are genetically predisposed to lower educational attainment are those who stand to benefit the most from the intervention. Our algorithms are implemented in an R package available on CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/package=sail.",2018,bioRxiv

Genome-wide screening diagnostic biomarkers and the construction of prognostic model of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Although methods in diagnosis and therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have made significant progress in decades, the overall survival (OS) of HCC remains dissatisfactory, so it is particularly important to find better diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. In this study, we found a more reliable potential diagnostic biomarkers and constructed a more accurate prognostic evaluation model based on integrated transcriptome sequencing analysis of multiple independent data sets. First, we performed quality evaluation and differential analysis on seven Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets, and then comprehensively analyzed the differentially expressed genes with a robust rank aggregation algorithm. Next,Â Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to establish an 8-gene prognostic risk score (RS) model. Finally, the prognostic model was further validated in the GEO data set. Also, RS has independence on other clinicopathological characteristics but has similarities in prognostic assessment compared with the T stage. Moreover, the combination of T stage and prognostic RS model based on the 8-gene had a better prognostic evaluation effect. In brief, our research suggest that the prognostic risk model of 8 genes has important clinical significance in HCC patients, and can further enrich the prognostic guidance value of the traditional T stage.",2019,Journal of cellular biochemistry
De-Biasing The Lasso With Degrees-of-Freedom Adjustment,"This paper studies schemes to de-bias the Lasso in sparse linear regression where the goal is to estimate and construct confidence intervals for a low-dimensional projection of the unknown coefficient vector in a preconceived direction $a_0$. We assume that the design matrix has iid Gaussian rows with known covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Our analysis reveals that previous propositions to de-bias the Lasso require a modification in order to enjoy asymptotic efficiency in a full range of the level of sparsity. This modification takes the form of a degrees-of-freedom adjustment that accounts for the dimension of the model selected by the Lasso. 
Let $s_0$ denote the number of nonzero coefficients of the true coefficient vector. The unadjusted de-biasing schemes proposed in previous studies enjoys efficiency if $s_0\lll n^{2/3}$, up to logarithmic factors. However, if $s_0\ggg n^{2/3}$, the unadjusted scheme cannot be efficient in certain directions $a_0$. In the latter regime, it it necessary to modify existing procedures by an adjustment that accounts for the degrees-of-freedom of the Lasso. The proposed degrees-of-freedom adjustment grants asymptotic efficiency for any direction $a_0$. This holds under a Sparse Riecz Condition on the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ and the sample size requirement $s_0/p\to0$ and $s_0\log(p/s_0)/n\to0$. 
Our analysis also highlights that the degrees-of-freedom adjustment is not necessary when the initial bias of the Lasso in the direction $a_0$ is small, which is granted under more stringent conditions on $\Sigma^{-1}$. This explains why the necessity of degrees-of-freedom adjustment did not appear in some previous studies. 
The main proof argument involves a Gaussian interpolation path similar to that used to derive Slepian's lemma. It yields a sharp $\ell_\infty$ error bound for the Lasso under Gaussian design which is of independent interest.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Predicting the tumor response to chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer: Model development and external validation using MRI radiomics.,"BACKGROUND
In well-responding patients to chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), a watch-and-wait strategy can be considered. To implement organ-sparing strategies, accurate patient selection is needed. We investigate the use of MRI-based radiomics models to predict tumor response to improve patient selection.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Models were developed in a cohort of 70 patients and validated in an external cohort of 55 patients. Patients received chemoradiation followed by surgery and underwent T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) before and after chemoradiation. The outcome measure was (near-)complete pathological tumor response (ypT0-1N0). Tumor segmentation was done on T2-images and transferred to b800-images and ADC maps, after which quantitative and four semantic features were extracted. We combined features using principal component analysis and built models using LASSO regression analysis. The best models based on precision and performance were selected for validation.


RESULTS
21/70 patients (30%) achieved ypT0-1N0 in the development cohort versus 13/55 patients (24%) in the validation cohort. Three models (t2_dwi_pre_post, semantic_dwi_adc_pre, semantic_dwi_post) were identified with an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% CI 0.70-0.95), 0.86 (95% CI 0.75-0.98) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.75-0.94) respectively. Two models (t2_dwi_pre_post, semantic_dwi_post) validated well in the external cohort with AUCs of 0.83 (95% CI 0.70-0.95) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.76-0.97). These models however did not outperform a previously established four-feature semantic model.


CONCLUSION
Prediction models based on MRI radiomics non-invasively predict tumor response after chemoradiation for rectal cancer and can be used as an additional tool to identify patients eligible for an organ-preserving treatment.",2019,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology
A warning thresholds scheme with dynamic oil parameters based on lasso regression and 6sigma,"Dynamic early warning makes great sense for oil management to keep safety and stability of oil production. In this paper, we derive the production regression model, predict production with 10 oil parameters based on Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) and Least Angle Regression (LARS) methods. The 10 most relevant oil parameters are decided by the warning parameters selection method from kinds of different parameters, which makes the prediction more reliable. The accuracy of regression model achieves 97%. Then we get the warning thresholds based on 6Ïƒ. Oil parameters for warning threshold partition experiment are from the database of Tianjin oilfield. The experiment results show that our method is capable of warning both mild and severe situation, and the accuracy is 95%, which runs ahead in oil industry and has great popularization value.",2016,2016 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
Financial literacy amongst elderly Australians,"Financial illiteracy is widespread amongst the elderly. Financially illiterate people are more likely to experience asset loss and outlive their savings after retirement. This paper measures financial literacy of elderly Australians using Item Responses Theory. Using a Lasso regression, we find that younger, married males with higher income and greater net wealth are more likely to be financially literate. Better financial literacy is also associated with good health, higher educational attainment, better occupation and outright home ownership. Our findings suggest policyâ€makers take action and we make informed and practicable policy recommendations.",2019,Accounting and Finance
Fast Screening Technology for Drug Emergency Management: Predicting Suspicious SNPs for ADR with Information Theory-based Models.,"OBJECTIVE
The genetic polymorphism of Cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) is considered as one of the main causes for adverse drug reactions (ADRs). In order to explore the latent correlations between ADRs and potentially corresponding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in CYP450, three algorithms based on information theory are used as the main method to predict the possible relation.


METHODS
The study uses a retrospective case-control study to explore the potential relation of ADRs to specific genomic locations and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The genomic data collected from 53 healthy volunteers are applied for the analysis, another group of genomic data collected from 30 healthy volunteers excluded from the study are used as the control group. The SNPs respective on five loci of CYP2D6*2,*10,*14 and CYP1A2*1C, *1F are detected by the Applied Biosystem 3130xl. The raw data is processed by ChromasPro to detect the specific alleles on the above loci from each sample. The secondary data are reorganized and processed by R combined with the reports of ADRs from clinical reports. Three information theory based algorithms are implemented for the screening task: JMI, CMIM, and mRMR. If a SNP is selected by more than two algorithms, we are confident to conclude that it is related to the corresponding ADR. The selection results are compared with the control decision tree + LASSO regression model.


RESULTS
In the study group where ADRs occur, 10 SNPs are considered relevant to the occurrence of a specific ADR by the combined information theory model. In comparison, only 5 SNPs are considered relevant to a specific ADR by the decision tree + LASSO regression model. In addition, the new method detects more relevant pairs of SNP and ADR which are affected by both SNP and dosage. This implies that the new information theory based model is effective to discover correlations of ADRs and CYP 450 SNPs and is helpful in predicting the potential vulnerable genotype for some ADRs.


CONCLUSION
The newly proposed information theory based model has superiority performance in detecting the relation between SNP and ADR compared to the decision tree + LASSO regression model. The new model is more sensitive to detect ADRs compared to the old method, while the old method is more reliable. Therefore, the selection criteria for selecting algorithms should depend on the pragmatic needs.",2018,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening
Precise prediction of the radiation pneumonitis in lung cancer: an explorative preliminary mathematical model using genotype information,"Purpose: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is the most significant dose-limiting toxicity and is one major obstacle for lung cancer radiotherapy. Grade â‰¥2 RP usually needs clinical interventions and serve RP could be life threatening. Clinically, tissue response could be strikingly different even two similar patients after identical radiotherapy. Previous methods for the RP prediction can hardly distinguish substantial variations among individuals. Reliable predictive factors or methods emphasizing the individual differences are strongly desired by clinical radiation oncologists. The purpose of this study is to develop an approach for the personalized RP risk prediction. Experimental Design: One hundred eighteen lung cancer patients who received radiotherapy were enrolled. Seven hundred thousand single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites were assessed via Generalized Linear Models via Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularization (GLMNET) to determine their synergistic effects on the RP risk prediction. Non-genetic factors including patient's phenotypes and clinical interventional parameters were separately assessed by statistic test. Based on the results of the aforementioned analysis, a multiple linear regression model named Radiation Pneumonitis Index (RPI) was built, for the assessment of Grade â‰¥2RP risk. Results: Only previous surgery and fractional dose were discovered statistical significantly associated with grade â‰¥2RP. Thirty-nine effective SNPs for predicting the Grade â‰¥2RP risk were discovered and their coefficients of the synergistic effect were determined. The RPI score can successfully distinguish the RPâ‰¥2 population with 92.0% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Conclusions: Individual radiation sensitivity can be determined with genotype information and personalized radiotherapy could be achieved based on mathematical model result.",2020,Journal of Cancer
Hypernetwork Construction and Feature Fusion Analysis Based on Sparse Group Lasso Method on fMRI Dataset,"Recent works have shown that the resting-state brain functional connectivity hypernetwork, where multiple nodes can be connected, are an effective technique for brain disease diagnosis and classification research. The lasso method was used to construct hypernetworks by solving sparse linear regression models in previous research. But, constructing a hypernetwork based on the lasso method simply selects a single variable, in that it lacks the ability to interpret the grouping effect. Considering the group structure problem, the previous study proposed to create a hypernetwork based on the elastic net and the group lasso methods, and the results showed that the former method had the best classification performance. However, the highly correlated variables selected by the elastic net method were not necessarily in the active set in the group. Therefore, we extended our research to address this issue. Herein, we propose a new method that introduces the sparse group lasso method to improve the construction of the hypernetwork by solving the group structure problem of the brain regions. We used the traditional lasso, group lasso method, and sparse group lasso method to construct a hypernetwork in patients with depression and normal subjects. Meanwhile, other clustering coefficients (clustering coefficients based on pairs of nodes) were also introduced to extract features with traditional clustering coefficients. Two types of features with significant differences obtained after feature selection were subjected to multi-kernel learning for feature fusion and classification using each method, respectively. The network topology results revealed differences among the three networks, where hypernetwork using the lasso method was the strictest; the group lasso, most lenient; and the sgLasso method, moderate. The network topology of the sparse group lasso method was similar to that of the group lasso method but different from the lasso method. The classification results show that the sparse group lasso method achieves the best classification accuracy by using multi-kernel learning, which indicates that better classification performance can be achieved when the group structure exists and is properly extended.",2020,Frontiers in Neuroscience
Variable Selection and Prediction with Incomplete High-dimensional Data.,"We propose a Multiple Imputation Random Lasso (mirl) method to select important variables and to predict the outcome for an epidemiological study of Eating and Activity in Teens. In this study 80% of individuals have at least one variable missing. Therefore, using variable selection methods developed for complete data after listwise deletion substantially reduces prediction power. Recent work on prediction models in the presence of incomplete data cannot adequately account for large numbers of variables with arbitrary missing patterns. We propose MIRL to combine penalized regression techniques with multiple imputation and stability selection. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to compare MIRL with several alternatives. MIRL outperforms other methods in high-dimensional scenarios in terms of both reduced prediction error and improved variable selection performance, and it has greater advantage when the correlation among variables is high and missing proportion is high. MIRL is shown to have improved performance when comparing with other applicable methods when applied to the study of Eating and Activity in Teens for the boys and girls separately, and to a subgroup of low social economic status (ses) Asian boys who are at high risk of developing obesity.",2016,The annals of applied statistics
Title Variable Selection via Penalized Likelihood Permalink,"Variable selection is vital to statistical data analyses. Many of procedures in use are ad hoc stepwise selection procedures, which are computationally expensive and ignore stochastic errors in the variable selection process of previous steps. An automatic and simultaneous variable selection procedure can be obtained by using a penalized likelihood method. In traditional linear models, the best subset selection and stepwise deletion methods coincide with a penalized leastsquares method when design matrices are orthonormal. In this paper, we propose a few new approaches to selecting variables for linear models, robust regression models and generalized linear models based on a penalized likelihood approach. A family of thresholding functions are proposed. The LASSO proposed by Tibshirani (1996) is a member of the penalized leastsquares with the L1-penalty. A smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty function is introduced to ameliorate the properties of L1-penalty. A uni ed algorithm is introduced, which is backed up by statistical theory. The new approaches are compared with the ordinary leastsquares methods, the garrote method by Breiman (1995) and the LASSO method by Tibshirani (1996). Our simulation results show that the newly proposed methods compare favorably with other approaches as an automatic variable selection technique. Because of simultaneous selection of variables and estimation of parameters, we are able to give a simple estimated standard error formula, which is tested to be accurate enough for practical applications. Two real data examples illustrate the versatility and e ectiveness of the proposed approaches.",1999,
Identification of a prognostic 5-Gene expression signature for gastric cancer,"PurposeGastric cancer (GC) is a major tumor throughout the world with remaining high morbidity and mortality. The aim is to generate a gene model to assess the prognoses risk of patients with GC.MethodsGene expression profiling of gastric cancer patients, GSE62254 (300 samples) and GSE26253 (432 samples), was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Univariate survival analysis and LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selectionator operator) (1000 iterations) of differentially expressed genes in GSE62254 was assessed using survival and glmnet in R package, respectively. Kaplanâ€“Meier analysis on the clustering algorithm from each regression model was performed to calculate the influence to the prognosis. Random samples in GSE26253 were analyzed in multivariate and univariate survival analysis for one thousand times to calculate statistical stability of each regression model.ResultsA total of 854 Genes were identified differentially expressed in GSE62254, among which 367 Genes were found influencing the prognoses. Six gene clusters were selected with good stability. Hereinto, five or more genes in 11-Gene model, TRPC1, SGCE, TNFRSF11A, LRRN1, HLF, CYS1, PPP1R14A, NOV, NBEA, CES1 and RGN, was available to evaluate the prognostic risk of GC patients in GSE26253 (P = 0.00445). The validity and reliability was validated.ConclusionIn conclusion, we successfully generated a stable 5-Gene model, which could be utilized to predict prognosis of GC patients and would contribute to postoperational treatment and follow-up strategies.",2016,Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology
Preoperative Prediction of Extracapsular Extension: Radiomics Signature Based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Stage Prostate Cancer,"PurposeTo investigate and validate the potential role of a radiomics signature in predicting the side-specific probability of extracapsular extension (ECE) of prostate cancer (PCa).ProceduresThe preoperative magnetic resonance imaging data of 238 prostatic samples from 119 enrolled PCa patients were retrospectively assessed. The samples with were randomized in a two-to-one ratio into training (nâ€‰=â€‰74) and validation (nâ€‰=â€‰45) datasets. The radiomics features were derived from T2-weighted images (T2WIs). The optimal radiomics features were identified from the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model and were used to construct a predictive radiomics signature via dimension reduction and selection approaches. The association between the radiomics signatures and pathological ECE status was explored. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the discriminatory ability of the signature. The calibration performance and clinical usefulness of the radiomics signature were subsequently assessed by calibration curve and decision curve analyses.ResultsThe proposed radiomics signature that incorporated 17 selected radiomics features was significantly associated with pathological ECE outcomes (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) in both the training and validation datasets. The constructed model displayed good discrimination, with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.906 (95Â % confidence interval (CI), 0.847, 0.948) and 0.821 (95Â % CI, 0.726, 0.894) for the training and validation datasets, respectively, and had a good calibration performance. The clinical utility of this model was confirmed through decision curve analysis.ConclusionsThe radiomics signature based on T2WIs showed the potential to predict the side-specific probability of pathological ECE status and can facilitate the preoperative individualized predictions for PCa patients.",2019,Molecular Imaging and Biology
Hyperparameter-selection for sparse regression: A probablistic approach,"The choice of hyperparameter(s) notably affects the support recovery in LASSO-like sparse regression problems, acting as an implicit model order selection. Parameters are typically selected using cross-validation or various ad hoc approaches. These often overestimates the resulting model order, aiming to minimize the prediction error rather than maximizing the support recovery. In this work, we propose a probabilistic approach to selecting hyperparameters in order to maximize the support recovery, quantifying the type I error (false positive rate) using extreme value analysis, such that the regularization level is selected as an appropriate quantile. By instead solving the scaled LASSO problem, the proposed choice of hyperparameter becomes almost independent of the noise variance. Simulation examples illustrate how the proposed method outperforms both cross-validation and the Bayesian Information Criterion in terms of computational complexity and support recovery.",2017,"2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers"
Expression Status And Prognostic Value Of M6A-associated Genes in Gastric Cancer,"Purpose: Gastric cancer (GC) is a primary cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most common RNA modifications that involves in the progression of numerous cancers. However, the expression status and function of m6A-related genes in gastric cancer is still not well understood. The current study is aimed to investigate the expression status and determinate prognostic value of m6A-related genes in gastric cancer. Methods: m6A-asssociated gene expression was evaluated via analyzing the expression data of GC patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The protein expression levels of m6A-associated molecules were further validated by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining data from GC tissue microarray (TMA) cohort and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess the prognostic value of m6A-associated genes in gastric cancer. Risk score model was established by lasso COX regression analysis and its prognostic predicted efficiency was assessed by the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve. Cox regression analyses were used for exploring risk factors related to GC patient prognosis. Results: Most of m6A-related genes were upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in gastric cancer tissues compared with that in normal gastric tissues. The expression levels of m6A-related genes were associated with clinicopathological features including race, age and TNM stage. High expression of WTAP and FTO predicted poor prognosis of GC patients. Survival analysis demonstrated that patients with high-risk scores had worse overall survival (OS) and ROC curves suggested the prediction performance for gastric patients. Moreover, Cox regression analyses indicated that m6A risk model score was a prognostic factor for OS and FTO upregulation might be a potential independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (RFS) in gastric cancer patients. Conclusion: m6A-related genes were dysregulated in GC and were closely associated with prognosis of GC patients. FTO might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer, while the m6A-related risk score might be informative for risk assessment and prognostic stratification.",2020,Journal of Cancer
81 Identifying and predicting novel classes of long-term disease trajectories for patients with juvenile dermatomyositis using growth mixture models,"Objectives Uncertainty around clinical heterogeneity and outcomes for patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) represents a major burden of disease and a challenge for clinical management. We sought to identify novel classes of patients having similar temporal patterns in disease activity and clinical features at baseline that predict class membership. Methods Data were obtained for n=519 patients, including demographic and clinical features at baseline, and the physicianâ€™s global assessment of disease (PGA) and the modified disease activity score for skin at all recorded visits. Growth mixture models (GMM) were fit to identify classes of patients with similar trajectories. Baseline predictors of class membership were analysed using lasso regression. Results GMM analysis of global disease activity identified 2 classes of patients. Patients in Class 1 (88.6%) tended to improve their PGA over time, while patients in Class 2 (11.6%) tended to have more ongoing disease. Lasso regression analysis identified abnormal respiration, lipodystrophy and an interaction between them as baseline predictors of Class 2 membership, with odds ratios of 1.71, 1.91 and 1.66, respectively. GMM analysis of skin disease activity identified 3 classes of patients. Patients in Classes 1 (14%) and 2 (11%) had higher levels of skin disease at diagnosis that steadily improved or remained high, respectively. Patients in Class 3 (66%) began with lower levels of skin disease that improved more quickly. Conclusions GMM analysis identified novel JDM sub-phenotypes based on longitudinal global and skin disease activities. Abnormal respiration and lipodystrophy at baseline predicted the group of patients with ongoing disease.",2019,Archives of Disease in Childhood
Optimization of turn-back primers in isothermal amplification,"The application of isothermal amplification technologies is rapidly expanding and currently covers different areas such as infectious disease, genetic disorder and drug dosage adjustment. Meanwhile, many of such technologies have complex reaction processes and often require a fine-tuned primer set where existing primer design tools are not sufficient. We have developed a primer selection system for one important primer, the turn-back primer (TP), which is commonly used in loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) and smart amplification process (SmartAmp). We chose 78 parameters related to the primer and target sequence, and explored their relationship to amplification speed using experimental data for 1344 primer combinations. We employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method for parameter selection and estimation of their numerical coefficients. We subsequently evaluated our prediction model using additional independent experiments and compared to the LAMP primer design tool, Primer Explorer version4 (PE4). The evaluation showed that our approach yields a superior primer design in isothermal amplification and is robust against variations in the experimental setup. Our LASSO regression analysis revealed that availability of the 3'- and 5'-end of the primer are particularly important factors for efficient isothermal amplification.

Boosting ridge regression,"There are several possible approaches to combining ridge regression with boosting techniques. In the simple or naive approach the ridge estimator is used to fit iteratively the current residuals yielding an alternative to the usual ridge estimator. In partial boosting only part of the regression parameters are reestimated within one step of the iterative procedure. The technique allows to distinguish between mandatory variables that are always included in the analysis and optional variables that are chosen only if relevant. The resulting procedure selects optional variables in a similar way as the Lasso, yielding a reduced set of influential variables, while allowing for regularized estimation of the mandatory parameters. The suggested procedures are investigated within the classical framework of continuous response variables as well as in the case of generalized linear models. The performance in terms of prediction and the identification of relevant variables is compared to several competitors as the Lasso and the more recently proposed elastic net. For the evaluation of the identification of relevant variables pseudo ROC curves are introduced.",2007,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
On the Equivalence of Sparse Statistical Problems,"Sparsity is a widely used and theoretically well understood notion that has allowed inference to be statistically and computationally possible in the high-dimensional setting. Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) and Sparse Linear Regression (SLR) are two problems that have a wide range of applications and have attracted a tremendous amount of attention in the last two decades as canonical examples of statistical problems in high dimension. A variety of algorithms have been proposed for both SPCA and SLR, but their literature has been disjoint for the most part. We have a fairly good understanding of conditions and regimes under which these algorithms succeed. But is there be a deeper connection between computational structure of SPCA and SLR? In this paper we show how to efficiently transform a blackbox solver for SLR into an algorithm for SPCA. Assuming the SLR solver satisfies prediction error guarantees achieved by existing efficient algorithms such as those based on the Lasso, we show that the SPCA algorithm derived from it achieves state of the art performance, matching guarantees for testing and for support recovery under the single spiked covariance model as obtained by the current best polynomial-time algorithms. Our reduction not only highlights the inherent similarity between the two problems, but also, from a practical standpoint, it allows one to obtain a collection of algorithms for SPCA directly from known algorithms for SLR. Experiments on simulated data show that these algorithms perform well. Thesis Supervisor: Guy Bresler Title: Assistant Professor",2017,
Application of GLASSO in Variable Selection and Crash Prediction at Unsignalized Intersections,"AbstractIn this paper, a new promising variable screening technique is proposed to select important covariates and to improve crash prediction; the group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO). The GLASSOâ€™s main power lies in its ability to deal with data sets havinga large number of categorical variables, the case in this study. Identifying the significant factors affecting the safety of unsignalized intersections was also an essential objective. Two applications of GLASSO were investigated: before fitting the negative binomial (NB) model, and before fitting the promising multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) technique using extensive data representing 2,475 unsignalized intersections. Regarding the NB models, GLASSO yielded close prediction capability to the backward deletion and random forest techniques. Also, MARS model fitting after using GLASSO relatively outperformed that after using random forest, with similar prediction performance. Because of its outstanding performan...",2012,Journal of Transportation Engineering-asce
Asymmetric information in loan contracts: A game-theoretic and statistical approach,"In this work, we apply game-theoretic and statistical models to an open problem regarding asymmetric information in loan contracts. Under these asymmetries, the effect of higher collateral requirements on the interest rates applied by banks to borrowers is not clear. The literature has argued both for positive and a negative links, based on different hypotheses and econometric analyses. We discuss how this effect cannot be decided a-priori. In the first part we construct three game-theoretic models under different hypotheses, proving the impossibility of an univocal effect. Then, to assess what is the prevailing effect in the reality, we analyze for the first time loan big-data for millions of borrowers among various European countries, as collected by the European DataWarehouse. We examine some mathematical and practical aspects of: the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the Principal Component Regression (PCR), the regularization theory, the LASSO and RIDGE regressions, applying them to our datasets. Finally, we combine a regression model with the Probabilistic PCA, discussing the EM algorithm in presence of sparse datasets. These datasets are characteristic of our database and others, and defining the Probabilistic PCR we propose a new technique which may show itself useful if the availability of loan data will increase over time conserving some data sparsity.",2016,
Statistical validation of normal tissue complication probability models.,"PURPOSE
To investigate the applicability and value of double cross-validation and permutation tests as established statistical approaches in the validation of normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
A penalized regression method, LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), was used to build NTCP models for xerostomia after radiation therapy treatment of head-and-neck cancer. Model assessment was based on the likelihood function and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.


RESULTS
Repeated double cross-validation showed the uncertainty and instability of the NTCP models and indicated that the statistical significance of model performance can be obtained by permutation testing.


CONCLUSION
Repeated double cross-validation and permutation tests are recommended to validate NTCP models before clinical use.",2012,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"
Impact of ethanol blending into gasoline on aromatic compound evaporation and particle emissions from a gasoline direct injection engine,"Abstract This study examined the interactions of ethanol with aromatic compounds on aromatic species evolution during gasoline evaporation and the consequent impacts on particle emissions from a single-cylinder, gasoline direct injection engine. From a chemical kinetic standpoint, the dilution of the aromatic species in gasoline by ethanol blending should reduce particle emissions because aromatics are the primary species that form particles during gasoline combustion. However, increased evaporative cooling from the ethanol and ethanolâ€™s effect on when aromatics in the fuel droplet (or surface film or pool) evaporate can drive an increase in particle emissions. The objective of this study was to quantify these competing effects. The results show that a combination of ethanolâ€™s increased evaporative cooling and impact on aromatic compound vapor-liquid equilibrium can extend droplet lifetime and cause aromatics to evaporate later in the droplet evaporation process than would be the case without ethanol. When fuels were burned in a direct-injection single-cylinder engine at high speed (2500â€¯rpm) and relatively high load, ethanol blending caused an increase in particle emissions for fuels containing a low vapor pressure aromatic. At a lower speed (1500â€¯rpm), no statistically significant increase in particle emissions was observed, likely because more time was available for evaporation and mixing to occur. In contrast, particle emissions from a fuel blended with a high vapor pressure aromatic were either insensitive to or reduced by ethanol blending, likewise to engine operating conditions. Current models for predicting particle emissions from gasoline engines, such as particulate matter index (PMI), generally lack variables for non-linear interactions between ethanol and gasoline hydrocarbons. To identify nonlinear interactions between predictor variables that might better explain the observed particle emissions, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularized regression approach was employed. Among the predictor variables evaluated was the Yield Sooting Index (YSI) which is as an improved measure to quantify the aromaticâ€™s chemical tendency to generate particle emissions. Following this analysis, two variables were selected based on their frequent appearance. The first was ethanol mole percent multiplied by aromatic mole percent divided by aromatic vapor pressure [(EtOH%â€¯*â€¯Aro%)/Aro VP@443â€¯K]. The second was aromatic mole percent multiplied by aromatic YSI divided by aromatic molecular weight [(Aro%â€¯*â€¯Aro YSI)/Aro MW]. The results of linear regression including only these two combined explanatory variables achieved an r2â€¯=â€¯0.959, substantially improved over the PMI model (r2â€¯=â€¯0.688) and provides insight into how the PMI formalism might be modified to account for non-linear oxygenate-hydrocarbon coupling.",2019,Applied Energy
Load-enhanced Movement Quality Screening and Tactical Athleticism: an Extension of Evidence.,"BACKGROUND
Military organizations use movement quality screening for prediction of injury risk and performance potential. Currently, evidence of an association between movement quality and performance is limited. Recent work has demonstrated that external loading strengthens the relationship between movement screens and performance outcomes. Such loading may therefore steer us toward robust implementations of movement quality screens while maintaining their appeal as cost effective, field-expedient tools.


PURPOSE
The purpose of the current study was to quantify the effect of external load-bearing on the relationship between clinically rated movement quality and tactical performance outcomes while addressing the noted limitations.


STUDY DESIGN
Crossover Trial.


METHODS
Fifty young adults (25 male, 25 female, 22.98â€‰Â±â€‰3.09 years, 171.95â€‰Â±â€‰11.46â€‰cm, 71.77â€‰Â±â€‰14.03â€‰kg) completed the Functional Movement Screenâ„¢ with (FMSâ„¢W) and without (FMSâ„¢C) a weight vest in randomized order. Following FMSâ„¢ testing, criterion measures of tactical performance were administered, including agility T-Tests, sprints, a 400-meter run, the Mobility for Battle (MOB) course, and a simulated casualty rescue. For each performance outcome, regression models were selected via group lasso with smoothed FMSâ„¢ item scores as candidate predictor variables.


RESULTS
For all outcomes, proportion of variance accounted for was greater in FMSâ„¢W (R2 = ;0.22 [T-Test], 0.29 [Sprint], 0.17 [400 meter], 0.29 [MOB], and 0.11 [casualty rescue]) than in FMSâ„¢C (R2 = ;0.00 [T-Test], 0.11 [Sprint], 0.00 [400 meter], 0.19 [MOB], and 0.00 [casualty rescue]). From the FMSâ„¢W condition, beneficial performance effects (p<0.05) were observed for Deep Squat (sprint, casualty rescue), Hurdle Step (T-Agility, 400 meter run), Inline Lunge (sprint, MOB), and Trunk Stability Push Up (all models). Similar effects for FMSâ„¢C item scores were limited to Trunk Stability Push Up (p<0.05, all models).


CONCLUSIONS
The present study extends evidence supporting the validity of load-enhanced movement quality screening as a predictor of tactical performance ability. Future designs should seek to identify mechanisms explaining this effect.

Screening of heritage data for improving toughness of creep-resistant martensitic steels,"Abstract Data science techniques were used to quantify the effect of alloying additions on the tensile behavior of martensitic steels. The effort was undertaken to exploit the heritage data to establish the next experimental design space for the class of 9â€“12â€¯wt% Cr steels for the application of turbine rotors with an operating temperature of 650 âˆ˜ C and above. Linear, lasso, and multivariate multiple regression models were utilized to identify which alloying elements contribute towards strength and ductility. Visualization techniques such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and pair-wire element specific comparisons were utilized to explore information gaps that exist within the data. The study found that tantalum, recently added to improve the creep rupture lifetime, does not show any effect on tensile properties. All combined, the results suggest that the low tempering temperature has compensated for the low alloying additions in the past, therefore, new experiments are needed to isolate the effects of tempering temperature from those of individual elements.",2019,Materials Science and Engineering A-structural Materials Properties Microstructure and Processing
The sparsity and bias of the Lasso selection in high-dimensional linear regression,"Meinshausen and Buhlmann [Ann. Statist. 34 (2006) 1436-1462] showed that, for neighborhood selection in Gaussian graphical models, under a neighborhood stability condition, the LASSO is consistent, even when the number of variables is of greater order than the sample size. Zhao and Yu [(2006) J. Machine Learning Research 7 2541-2567] formalized the neighborhood stability condition in the context of linear regression as a strong irrepresentable condition. That paper showed that under this condition, the LASSO selects exactly the set of nonzero regression coefficients, provided that these coefficients are bounded away from zero at a certain rate. In this paper, the regression coefficients outside an ideal model are assumed to be small, but not necessarily zero. Under a sparse Riesz condition on the correlation of design variables, we prove that the LASSO selects a model of the correct order of dimensionality, controls the bias of the selected model at a level determined by the contributions of small regression coefficients and threshold bias, and selects all coefficients of greater order than the bias of the selected model. Moreover, as a consequence of this rate consistency of the LASSO in model selection, it is proved that the sum of error squares for the mean response and the l Î± -loss for the regression coefficients converge at the best possible rates under the given conditions. An interesting aspect of our results is that the logarithm of the number of variables can be of the same order as the sample size for certain random dependent designs.",2008,Annals of Statistics
P1048: Increased amount of reported total sleep time during 24 hours is related to the severity of sleep disturbances in ischemic stroke patients,"s of Poster Presentations / Clinical Neurophysiology 125, Supplement 1 (2014) S1â€“S339 S327 P1046 Data-driven modeling of sleep EEG and EOG reveals stages indicative of pre-Parkinson and Parkinsonâ€™s disease J.A.E.

Lundbeck A/S, Clinical Pharmacology, Valby, Denmark; 5University of Copenhagen, Center for Healthy Ageing, Copenhagen, Denmark Question: Will unsupervised modelling of sleep EOG and sleep EEG reveal sleep characteristica indicative of pre-Parkinson and Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD)? Methods: Polysomnographic (PSG) data from 10 age-matched control subjects were used to develop an EOG sleep model and an EEG sleep model. The sleep models were applied on full-night PSG data from 24 additional control subjects, 26 patients with periodic leg movements (PLM), 31 patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and 36 PD patients. Based on the data-driven sleep models, features reflecting sleep characteristics in the EEG and EOG activity were computed. The total amount of data was devided in a training dataset containing 16 subjects from each of the four groups, and a validation dataset containing the remaining subjects. The features derived were evaluated and the most discriminative ones between iRBD/PD (neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) cases) and PLM/controls (motor, but non-NDD cases) were found by training a Lasso regularized Regression model using eight-fold cross-validation on the training dataset. Results: The best classification model included four features derived from the EEG data, and the NDD patients in the validation dataset could be classified with a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 61.1%. The most discriminative features were found to be thresholded amounts and stability of EEG topics reflected to REM, N3 and N1/N2, respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests that the amount of N3 and R and the ability to maintain NREM and REM sleep determined by a data-driven sleep model can be used as potentially early PD biomarkers.

Leskelae2, E. Rauhala1 1Satakunta Central Hospital, Clinical Neurophysiology, Pori, Finland; 2Satakunta Central Hospital, Neurology, Pori, Finland Question: Are self-reported short and long term sleep quality related to the severity of sleep related breathing disturbances (SRBD) in ischemic stroke patients? Methods: In this pilot study, 23 patients with acute first-time stroke, admitted to the stroke unit, underwent overnight polygraphy during the first 72 h after admission. Nasal airflow, respiratory movements, snoring sound, oxygenation level, and ECG were recorded. The incidence of SRBD before the stroke was studied with a questionnaire regarding their sleep three months prior the stroke. The reported quality of sleep during the treatment period in stroke unit was examined with the visual scale questionnaire containing five questions. The severity of stroke was assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the ability to function with the Barthel Index. Results: Increased apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was related to the increased amount of total sleep time during 24 hours (p=0.006). No association was found between AHI and the amount of sleep time during night. Also, no correlations between AHI and VAS questions were found. Increased AHI was related with lower Barthel Index (p=0.017) but not with NIHSS. Conclusions: SRBD as well as excessive daytime sleepiness are common findings in patients after stroke. In our study, stroke patients with increased AHI reported increased amount of sleep time during 24 h but not during night time regarding three months pre-stroke, suggesting that they are napping. SRBD negatively affect to the functional outcome after stroke. In addition, SRBD increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, which in turn increases risk for stroke. It is suggested that early diagnosis and treatment of underlying SRBD improve both recovery from stroke in short term and reduce the risk of relapses in long term. Our preliminary results suggest that reported napping may be a marker for a potential SRBD in stroke patients. P1049 Non-REM sleep microstructures and phasic REM sleep events are associated with intracranial oxygenation changes measured with NIRS J. Toppila1, T. Naesi2, J. Virtanen2, T. Salmi1, R. Ilmoniemi2 1Helsinki University Hospital, Medical Imaging/Clin. Neurophys., Helsinki, Finland; 2Aalto University, BECS, Espoo, Finland Question: Disordered and fragmented sleep due to sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and insomnia are associated with an increased risk of cardioand cerebrovascular morbidity. Autonomic activation and repetitive hypoxia are examples of possible mechanisms mediating this risk. In addition to sleep apnea episodes, non-apneic disruptions in sleep continuity are associated with transitory intracranial hypoxia measured with nearinfrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Some of the K-complexes are triggered by non-waking external auditory stimuli. Phasic rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep is associated with the activation of the autonomic nervous system and surges in systemic blood pressure. Are these sleep microstructural phenomena associated with changes in intracranial blood oxygenation? Methods: Six healthy volunteers were measured overnight with polysomnography and NIRS for extraand intracranial blood oxygenation changes. Sleep spindles, K-complexes, and bursts of eye movements in REM sleep were detected. Average temporal changes in oxyand deoxyhemoglobin triggered by these sleep events were measured. Results: K-complexes triggered short intracranial hemodynamic responses and spindels delayed and longer responses. During and after phasic events in REM sleep, there were transient changes in intracranial blood oxygenation. Conclusions: K-complexes are associated with transient hemodynamic changes in intracranial circulation, which can mediate harmful vascular effects during poor sleep due to noisy environments. Systemic blood pressure surges during phasic REM sleep are counteracted with vasoconstriction in cerebral arteries, leading to transient cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxia episodes during REM sleep. This could be associated with an increased risk of stroke during early mornings. P1050 Neurophysiological testing of the upper airway in obstructive sleep apnea showing peripheral nervous lesions E.

[A new method of sparse feature extraction for stellar spectra].,"The authors propose a novel method of feature extraction for stellar spectra parameterization. The basic procedures are: First, stellar spectra are decomposed by multi-scale Harr wavelet and the coefficients with high-frequency are rejected. Secondly, the optimal features are detected by the lasso algorithm. Finally, we input the optimal feature vector to non-parametric regression model to estimate the atmospheric parameters. Haar wavelet can remove the high-frequency noise from the stellar spectrum. Lasso algorithm can further compress data by analyzing their significance on parameterization and removing redundancy. Experiments show that the proposed Haar+lasso method improves the accuracy and efficiency of the estimation. The authors used this scheme to estimate the atmospheric parameters from a subsample of some 40,000 stellar spectra from SDSS. The accuracies of our predictions (mean absolute errors) for each parameter are 0.0071 dex for log Teff, 0.2252 dex for log g, and 0.1996 dex for [Fe/H]. Compared with the results of the existing literature, this scheme can derive more accurate atmospheric parameters.",2014,Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu
Development of a multicomponent prediction model for acute esophagitis in lung cancer patients receiving chemoradiotherapy.,"PURPOSE
To construct a model for the prediction of acute esophagitis in lung cancer patients receiving chemoradiotherapy by combining clinical data, treatment parameters, and genotyping profile.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Data were available for 273 lung cancer patients treated with curative chemoradiotherapy. Clinical data included gender, age, World Health Organization performance score, nicotine use, diabetes, chronic disease, tumor type, tumor stage, lymph node stage, tumor location, and medical center. Treatment parameters included chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy technique, tumor dose, mean fractionation size, mean and maximal esophageal dose, and overall treatment time. A total of 332 genetic polymorphisms were considered in 112 candidate genes. The predicting model was achieved by lasso logistic regression for predictor selection, followed by classic logistic regression for unbiased estimation of the coefficients. Performance of the model was expressed as the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic and as the false-negative rate in the optimal point on the receiver operating characteristic curve.


RESULTS
A total of 110 patients (40%) developed acute esophagitis Grade â‰¥2 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0). The final model contained chemotherapy treatment, lymph node stage, mean esophageal dose, gender, overall treatment time, radiotherapy technique, rs2302535 (EGFR), rs16930129 (ENG), rs1131877 (TRAF3), and rs2230528 (ITGB2). The area under the curve was 0.87, and the false-negative rate was 16%.


CONCLUSION
Prediction of acute esophagitis can be improved by combining clinical, treatment, and genetic factors. A multicomponent prediction model for acute esophagitis with a sensitivity of 84% was constructed with two clinical parameters, four treatment parameters, and four genetic polymorphisms.",2011,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"
