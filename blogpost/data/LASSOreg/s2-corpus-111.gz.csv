From Sparse Regression to Sparse Multiple Correspondence Analysis,"High dimensional data means that the number of variables p if far larger
than the number of observations n.
This talk starts from a survey of various solutions in linear regression .
When p n the OLS estimator does not exist . Since it is a case of forced multi-
collinearity, one may use regularized techniques such as ridge regression, principal
component regression or PLS regression which keep all the predictors.
However if p n combinations of all variables cannot be interpreted. Sparse so-
lutions, ie with a large number of zero coe cients, are preferred. Lasso, elastic net,
sparse PLS perform simultaneously regularization and variable selection thanks to
non quadratic penalties: L1, SCAD etc.
In PCA, the singular value decomposition shows that if we regress principal com-
ponents onto the input variables, the vector of regression coe cients is equal to the
factor loadings. It su ces to adapt sparse regression techniques to get sparse ver-
sions of PCA and of PCA with groups of variables. We conclude by a presentation of
a sparse version of Multiple Correspondence Analysis and give several applications.",2013,
Efficient cross-trait penalized regression increases prediction accuracy in large cohorts using secondary phenotypes,"We introduce cross-trait penalized regression (CTPR), a powerful and practical approach for multi-trait polygenic risk prediction in large cohorts. Specifically, we propose a novel cross-trait penalty function with the Lasso and the minimax concave penalty (MCP) to incorporate the shared genetic effects across multiple traits for large-sample GWAS data. Our approach extracts information from the secondary traits that is beneficial for predicting the primary trait based on individual-level genotypes and/or summary statistics. Our novel implementation of a parallel computing algorithm makes it feasible to apply our method to biobank-scale GWAS data. We illustrate our method using large-scale GWAS data (~1M SNPs) from the UK Biobank (Nâ€‰=â€‰456,837). We show that our multi-trait method outperforms the recently proposed multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG) for predictive performance. The prediction accuracy for height by the aid of BMI improves from R2â€‰=â€‰35.8% (MTAG) to 42.5% (MCPâ€‰+â€‰CTPR) or 42.8% (Lassoâ€‰+â€‰CTPR) with UK Biobank data.Information of genetic architectures of complex traits can be leveraged for predicting phenotypes. Here, the authors develop CTPR (Cross-Trait Penalized Regression), a method for multi-trait polygenic risk prediction using individual-level genotypes and/or summary statistics from large cohorts.",2019,Nature Communications
Assessing Site Effects and Geographic Transferability when Interpolating Point Referenced Spatial Data: A Digital Soil Mapping Case Study,"When making inferences concerning the environment, ground truthed data will frequently be available as point referenced (geostatistical) observations that are clustered into multiple sites rather than uniformly spaced across the area of interest. In such situations, the similarity of the dominant processes influencing the observed data across sites and the accuracy with which models fitted to data from one site can predict data from another site provide valuable information for scientists seeking to make inferences from these data. Such information may motivate a more informed second round of modelling of the data and also provides insight into the generality of the models developed and an indication of how these models may perform at predicting observations from other sites. We have investigated the geographic transferability of site specific models and compared the results of using different implementations of site specific effects in models for data combined from two sites. Since we have access to data on a broad collection of environmental characteristics that each held potential to aid the interpolation of our geostatistical response observations we have investigated these issues within the framework of a computationally efficient method for variable selection when the number of explanatory variables exceeds the number of observations. We have applied Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO) regularized Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) as fitted by the computationally efficient Least Angle Regression algorithm. The response variable in our case study, soil carbon, is of interest as a potential location for the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and for its positive contribution to soil health and fertility.",2016,arXiv: Applications
Two-part hidden Markov models for semicontinuous longitudinal data with nonignorable missing covariates.,"This study develops a two-part hidden Markov model (HMM) for analyzing semicontinuous longitudinal data in the presence of missing covariates. The proposed model manages a semicontinuous variable by splitting it into two random variables: a binary indicator for determining the occurrence of excess zeros at all occasions and a continuous random variable for examining its actual level. For the continuous longitudinal response, an HMM is proposed to describe the relationship between the observation and unobservable finite-state transition processes. The HMM consists of two major components. The first component is a transition model for investigating how potential covariates influence the probabilities of transitioning from one hidden state to another. The second component is a conditional regression model for examining the state-specific effects of covariates on the response. A shared random effect is introduced to each part of the model to accommodate possible unobservable heterogeneity among observation processes and the nonignorability of missing covariates. A Bayesian adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) procedure is developed to conduct simultaneous variable selection and estimation. The proposed methodology is applied to a study on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. New insights into the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and its potential risk factors are obtained.",2020,Statistics in medicine
P124: Targeted bisulfite sequencing of potential prostate cancer cell-free DNA markers: novel approach to reveal diagnostically significant molecules,"Cancer cells display altered methylation signatures distinguishing them from normal cells. Originating from all tissues and cells of the body cell-free DNA (cfDNA) including aberrantly methylated DNA reflect epigenetic aberrations occurs not only in tumor cells but also in tumor microenvironment. Actually, aberrantly methylated cfDNA has proved to be a promising biomarker for noninvasive detection of cancer with several clinically-certified tests (Epi-pro ColonÂ®, Epi-pro LungÂ®, CologuardÂ®). However only one test (Epi-pro ColonÂ®) uses blood plasma â€“ the most convenient source of cfDNA. Input of tissue and age specific methylation along with unidentified reasons lead to the presence of molecules with every conceivable cytosine-methylation patterns which decrease probability of tumor DNA identification. Among numerous variants of cfDNA methylation patterns only few reflect cancer related changes. To identify those tumor-specific profiles single nucleotide resolution of methylated cytosine locations in the individual circulating DNA molecules is obviously required. We performed target bisulfite sequencing of potential prostate cancer (PC) cfDNA markers (GSTP1; RNF219) isolated from blood plasma of 18 healthy donors (HD), 17 benign hyperplasia (BPH) and 20 PC patients using MiSeq platform (Illumina). RNF219 gene was shown to have high diagnostic potential in our previous comparative study of cfDNA from HD, PC and BHP patients using HCGI12k microarrays (Cortese, et al., 2012). GSTP1 is a common pathological DNA methylation event in PC and is most widely studied and promising methylation marker in the cfDNA of PC patients (Wu, et al., 2011). Selected loci were amplified after bisulfite conversion (Zymo Research) of cfDNA with methyl-independent barcoded primers and sequenced with coverage ranging from 23509 to 143953. Identification of CpG methylation status in DNA fragments was performed with the BiQ Analyzer HT Software. All statistical analysis was performed using R Statistical Software (version 3.1.1) To reveal diagnostically significant differences, several approaches to data analysis were used. Conventional approach is a prediction of patientâ€™s diagnosis based on differences in methylation level of CpG-sites. Another approach used in this study relies on discrimination of cancer-related correlation between methylation statuses of CpG-sites within individual molecules of cfDNA â€“ Intramolecular Correlation of Methylation Statuses (ICoMS). Study population was randomly subsampled into training and test cohorts. The logit regression model based on methylation level of CpG-sites achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) exceeding 0.94 in both cohorts for GSTP1 gene and 0.81 â€“ for RNF219 gene. A novel approach to identify diagnostic significance of cfDNA methylation was based on comparison of correlation matrices (pairwise phi coefficient between methylation statuses of CpG sites) for HD, BHP and PC groups. Binomial regression models with LASSO penalization were used to predict patientâ€™s diagnosis. ROC curves for fitted models show AUC, specificity and sensitivity as 0.99, 100% and 92% for GSTP1 gene and 0.99, 100% and 90% for RNF219 (test cohort). The ICoMS approach estimates diagnostic value of target genes and reveals cancer-related cytosine methylation. That could potentially input in gene expression, identify the features of tumor physiology and on a par with conventional approaches provide helpful information for rational design of noninvasive, methylation-specific cfDNA-based diagnostics for PC. Moreover, the planned further evaluation of relationship between the revealed correlations associated with cancer and tumor biology could increase the basic knowledge of carcinogenesis.",2015,Ejc Supplements
Neighborhood Properties Are Important Determinants of Temperature Sensitive Mutations,"Temperature-sensitive (TS) mutants are powerful tools to study gene function in vivo. These mutants exhibit wild-type activity at permissive temperatures and reduced activity at restrictive temperatures. Although random mutagenesis can be used to generate TS mutants, the procedure is laborious and unfeasible in multicellular organisms. Further, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the TS phenotype are poorly understood. To elucidate TS mechanisms, we used a machine learning method-logistic regression-to investigate a large number of sequence and structure features. We developed and tested 133 features, describing properties of either the mutation site or the mutation site neighborhood. We defined three types of neighborhood using sequence distance, Euclidean distance, and topological distance. We discovered that neighborhood features outperformed mutation site features in predicting TS mutations. The most predictive features suggest that TS mutations tend to occur at buried and rigid residues, and are located at conserved protein domains. The environment of a buried residue often determines the overall structural stability of a protein, thus may lead to reversible activity change upon temperature switch. We developed TS prediction models based on logistic regression and the Lasso regularized procedure. Through a ten-fold cross-validation, we obtained the area under the curve of 0.91 for the model using both sequence and structure features. Testing on independent datasets suggested that the model predicted TS mutations with a 50% precision. In summary, our study elucidated the molecular basis of TS mutants and suggested the importance of neighborhood properties in determining TS mutations. We further developed models to predict TS mutations derived from single amino acid substitutions. In this way, TS mutants can be efficiently obtained through experimentally introducing the predicted mutations.",2011,PLoS ONE
The search for genes associated to disease: The LASSO method and the case of Bone Mineral Density,"Bone Mineral Density (BMD) tells us about the amount of minerals in bones, and gives an indication of bones strength. The BMD is influenced by genetic factors as well as nutrition, sex hormone status, glucocorticoid therapy and physical activity among others. In this project we have focused on genes making an impact on BMD, by using mathematics and regression. Since the number of explanatory variables x (genes) overrides the number of response variables y (women) we use the variable selection method called LASSO. In that way we are able to sort out the genes with the highest contribution to BMD. We discovered 55 unique genes, among which ATP5SL, TNXA /// TNXB, SOST, PBXIP1, SNCA, GTF2F2, DPP8, C4orf31, TFDP2 and MCF2L were among those with the strongest association to BMD. SOST, AFFX-M27830 M at, PBXIP1 and RNF216 found by LASSO, confirms previous literature. Most of the genes seems to be highly associated with and probably have some impact on BMD.",2015,
The 2016 US Presidential Election and Its Chinese Audience,"Motivated by the question of how the public in an authoritarian political environment may perceive democratic elections, we analyze the underlying interests and sentiments of the Chinese audience regarding the 2016 US Presidential Election with the social media data collected from a large Chinese online community. We extract several latent topics of interest to the community from the text corpus by applying the unsupervised learning method of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and explore the amount of interests received by each topic by applying the supervised learning methods, including the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees and the Bayesian LASSO model. Results reveal much more attentions paid by the audience to the sensational news, especially the controversies related to Hillary Clintonâ€™s email leakage and Donald Trumpâ€™s anti-political-correctness and anti-globalization remarks, than to the substantive issues, e.g., regarding the candidatesâ€™ policy agendas or the democratic process.",2017,
SÃ©lection de variables et estimateurs de type LASSO,"Le probleme general etudie dans cette these est celui de la regression lineaire en grande dimension. On s'interesse particulierement aux methodes d'estimation qui capturent la sparsite du parametre cible. Une methode populaire pour estimer le parametre inconnu de la regression dans ce contexte est l'estimateur des moindres carres penalises par la norme l1 des coefficients, connu sous le nom de LASSO. Les contributions de cet ouvrage portent sur l'etude de variantes de l'estimateur LASSO pour prendre en compte soit des informations supplementaires sur les variables d'entree, soit des modes semi-supervises d'acquisition des donnees. Plus precisement, les questions abordees dans ce travail sont : l'estimation du parametre inconnu lorsque l'espace des variables explicatives a une structure bien determinee (presence de correlations, structure d'ordre sur les variables ou regroupements entre variables) ; la construction d'estimateurs adaptes au cadre transductif, pour lequel les nouvelles observations non etiquetees sont prises en consideration. Ces adaptations sont en partie deduites par une modification de la penalite dans la definition de l'estimateur LASSO.",2011,
Selective inference with unknown variance via the square-root LASSO,"There has been much recent work on inference after model selection when the noise level is known, for example in forward stepwise model selection or LASSO with an independent estimate of $\sigma$. In this work we consider the more realistic scenario of an unknown noise level and propose using the square root LASSO (also known as the scaled LASSO) to conduct selective inference without previous knowledge of $\sigma$. Applying the selective inference framework described in Fithian et al. (2014), we construct selectively valid exact tests of parameters in the selected model. We discuss regression diagnostics including tests for inclusion of variables not selected by the square root LASSO. The selective inference framework also suggests a natural pseudo-likelihood estimate of the noise level that performs better than other estimates of $\sigma$ from the square root LASSO. Based on this estimate we use a Gaussian approximation to construct confidence intervals. We also consider exact inference when holding out some data for inference in the second stage, noting the same increase in power observed in Fithian et al. (2014). We illustrate our method on an HIV drug resistance dataset and in a multi-scale change point detection problem where the number of regressors is order $n^2$.",2015,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Predicting occurrence rate of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) and Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) in pregnant women,"Years ago, doctors advised women with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not to become pregnant for fear of maternal health. Now, it is known that healthy pregnancy is possible for women with lupus but at the expense of higher pregnancy complication rate. The main objective of this research is to identify key factors contributing to these diseases and to predict the occurrence rate of SLE and RA in pregnant women. Based on the approach used in this study, prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes for women with SLE, RA and other diseases such as DM (Diabetes Mellitus) and APS (Anti-Phospholipid Antibody Syndrome) can be carried out. These results will help pregnant women to undergo healthy pregnancy by proper medication at an earlier stage. The data set was obtained from Cerner Health Facts data warehouse. The raw data set contains 883,473 records and 85 variables such as diagnosis code, age, race, procedure code, admission date, discharge date, total charges etc. Analyses were carried out with two different datasets, one for SLE patients and the other for RA patients. The final datasets had 397,898 and 398,742 records each for modeling RA and SLE patients respectively. To provide an honest assessment of models, the data was split into training and validation using data partition node. Variable selection techniques such as LASSO, LARS, Stepwise Regression, and Forward Regression were used. Using decision tree, prominent factors that determines the SLE and RA occurrence rate were identified separately. Of all the predictive models run using SASÂ® Enterprise MinerTM 12.3, the model comparison node identified Decision tree (Gini) as the best model with the least misclassification rate of 0.308 to predict the SLE patients and 0.288 to predict the RA patients.",2016,
A quantitative model based on clinically relevant MRI features differentiates lower grade gliomas and glioblastoma,"To establish a quantitative MR model that uses clinically relevant features of tumor location and tumor volume to differentiate lower grade glioma (LRGG, grades II and III) and glioblastoma (GBM, grade IV). We extracted tumor location and tumor volume (enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, peritumor edema) features from 229 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LGG and TCGA-GBM cases. Through two sampling strategies, i.e., institution-based sampling and repeat random sampling (10 times, 70% training set vs 30% validation set), LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression and nineâ€“machine learning methodâ€“based models were established and evaluated. Principal component analysis of 229 TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM cases suggested that the LRGG and GBM cases could be differentiated by extracted features. For nine machine learning methods, stack modeling and support vector machine achieved the highest performance (institution-based sampling validation set, AUC >â€‰0.900, classifier accuracy >â€‰0.790; repeat random sampling, average validation set AUC >â€‰0.930, classifier accuracy >â€‰0.850). For the LASSO method, regression model based on tumor frontal lobe percentage and enhancing and non-enhancing tumor volume achieved the highest performance (institution-based sampling validation set, AUC 0.909, classifier accuracy 0.830). The formula for the best performance of the LASSO model was established. Computer-generated, clinically meaningful MRI features of tumor location and component volumes resulted in models with high performance (validation set AUC >â€‰0.900, classifier accuracy >â€‰0.790) to differentiate lower grade glioma and glioblastoma. â€¢ Lower grade glioma and glioblastoma have significant different location and component volume distributions. â€¢ We built machine learning prediction models that could help accurately differentiate lower grade gliomas and GBM cases. We introduced a fast evaluation model for possible clinical differentiation and further analysis.",2020,European Radiology
Genomic selection for quantitative adult plant stem rust resistance in wheat,"Quantitative adult plant resistance (APR) to stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) is an important breeding target in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and a potential target for genomic selection (GS). To evaluate the relative importance of known APR loci in applying GS, we characterized a set of CIMMYT germplasm at important APR loci and on a genome-wide profile using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Using this germplasm, we describe the genetic architecture and evaluate prediction models for APR using data from the international Ug99 stem rust screening nurseries. Prediction models incorporating markers linked to important APR loci and seedling phenotype scores as fixed effects were evaluated along with the classic prediction models: Multiple linear regression (MLR), Genomic best linear unbiased prediction (G-BLUP), Bayesian Lasso (BL), and Bayes Cp (BCp). We found the Sr2 region to play an important role in APR in this germplasm. A model using Sr2 linked markers as fixed effects in G-BLUP was more accurate than MLR with Sr2 linked markers (p-value = 0.12), and ordinary G-BLUP (p-value = 0.15). Incorporating seedling phenotype information as fixed effects in G-BLUP did not consistently increase accuracy. Overall, levels of prediction accuracy found in this study indicate that GS can be effectively applied to improve stem rust APR in this germplasm, and if genotypes at Sr2 linked markers are available, modeling these genotypes as fixed effects could lead to better predictions.",2014,The Plant Genome
A Hierarchical Bayesian Framework for Constructing Sparsity-inducing Priors,"Variable selection techniques have become increasingly popular amongst statisticians due to an increased number of regression and classification applications involving high-dimensional data where we expect some predictors to be unimportant. In this context, Bayesian variable selection techniques involving Markov chain Monte Carlo exploration of the posterior distribution over models can be prohibitively computationally expensive and so there has been attention paid to quasi-Bayesian approaches such as maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using priors that induce sparsity in such estimates. We focus on this latter approach, expanding on the hierarchies proposed to date to provide a Bayesian interpretation and generalization of state-of-the-art penalized optimization approaches and providing simultaneously a natural way to include prior information about parameters within this framework. We give examples of how to use this hierarchy to compute MAP estimates for linear and logistic regression as well as sparse precision-matrix estimates in Gaussian graphical models. In addition, an adaptive group lasso method is derived using the framework.",2010,arXiv: Methodology
Genome-wide association analysis by lasso penalized logistic regression,"MOTIVATION
In ordinary regression, imposition of a lasso penalty makes continuous model selection straightforward. Lasso penalized regression is particularly advantageous when the number of predictors far exceeds the number of observations.


METHOD
The present article evaluates the performance of lasso penalized logistic regression in case-control disease gene mapping with a large number of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) predictors. The strength of the lasso penalty can be tuned to select a predetermined number of the most relevant SNPs and other predictors. For a given value of the tuning constant, the penalized likelihood is quickly maximized by cyclic coordinate ascent. Once the most potent marginal predictors are identified, their two-way and higher order interactions can also be examined by lasso penalized logistic regression.


RESULTS
This strategy is tested on both simulated and real data. Our findings on coeliac disease replicate the previous SNP results and shed light on possible interactions among the SNPs.

"Title: "" an Efficient Genome-wide Multilocus Epistasis Search ""","High-throughput laboratory techniques are producing vast amount of genomic marker data â€“ discrete predictors to association studies. Linear regression model is often considered to link study phenotypes and these marker measurements to each other. Number of predictors in multi-marker regression models can easily be much larger than number of observations. Therefore, one needs application of variable selection to find small subset of important predictors out of large number of candidates. Such models can occasionally include also all pairwise locus-by-locus (epistasis) interactions which increases dimensionality of the model very rapidly. We consider variable selection problem of linear model containing large amount of predictors and all of their pairwise interactions in the model jointly. Our suggested approach (KÃ¤rkkÃ¤inen et al. 2015) use sureindependence-screening to first drop dimension of the problem by considering marginal importance of each interaction term within the huge loop. Subsequent estimation step then consider Bayesian variable selection approach (Extended Bayesian LASSO â€“ Mutshinda and SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ 2010). We also show that it is important to separate search of main and interaction effects in the algorithm to control number of false positives. Examples illustrates superior performance of our method over PLINK in terms of computation time and empirical power. Our successful examples consider even problem of originally of order of 280,000,000 interactions within a reasonable time frame.

Weighted Lasso with Data Integration,"The lasso is one of the most commonly used methods for high-dimensional regression, but can be unstable and lacks satisfactory asymptotic properties for variable selection. We propose to use weighted lasso with integrated relevant external information on the covariates to guide the selection towards more stable results. Weighting the penalties with external information gives each regression coefficient a covariate specific amount of penalization and can improve upon standard methods that do not use such information by borrowing knowledge from the external material. The method is applied to two cancer data sets, with gene expressions as covariates. We find interesting gene signatures, which we are able to validate. We discuss various ideas on how the weights should be defined and illustrate how different types of investigations can utilize our method exploiting different sources of external data. Through simulations, we show that our method outperforms the lasso and the adaptive lasso when the external information is from relevant to partly relevant, in terms of both variable selection and prediction.",2011,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
Radiomics signature of computed tomography imaging for prediction of survival and chemotherapeutic benefits in gastric cancer,"To develop and validate a radiomics signature for the prediction of gastric cancer (GC) survival and chemotherapeutic benefits. In this multicenter retrospective analysis, we analyzed the radiomics features of portal venous-phase computed tomography in 1591 consecutive patients. A radiomics signature was generated by using the Lasso-Cox regression model in 228 patients and validated in internal and external validation cohorts. Radiomics nomograms integrating the radiomics signature were constructed, demonstrating the incremental value of the radiomics signature to the traditional staging system for individualized survival estimation. The performance of the nomograms was assessed with respect to calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. The radiomics signature consisted of 19 selected features and was significantly associated with DFS (disease-free survival) and OS (overall survival). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the radiomics signature was an independent prognostic factor. Incorporating the radiomics signature into the radiomics-based nomograms resulted in better performance for the estimation of DFS and OS than the clinicopathological nomograms and TNM staging system, with improved accuracy of the classification of survival outcomes. Further analysis showed that stage II and III patients with higher radiomics scores exhibited a favorable response to chemotherapy. In conclusion, the newly developed radiomics signature is a powerful predictor of DFS and OS, and it may predict which patients with stage II and III GC benefit from chemotherapy.",2018,EBioMedicine
Outcomes of the Equivalence of Adaptive Ridge with Least Absolute Shrinkage,"Adaptive Ridge is a special form of Ridge regression, balancing the quadratic penalization on each parameter of the model. It was shown to be equivalent to Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), in the sense that both procedures produce the same estimate. Lasso can thus be viewed as a particular quadratic penalizer. 
 
From this observation, we derive a fixed point algorithm to compute the Lasso solution. The analogy provides also a new hyper-parameter for tuning effectively the model complexity. We finally present a series of possible extensions of lasso performing sparse regression in kernel smoothing, additive modeling and neural net training.",1998,
A novel imputation method for missing values in air pollutant time series data,"Missing data is a widespread problem that studies in air quality have to deal with. The causes are varied, including sensor malfunctions and errors, power outages, computer system crashes, pollutant levels lower than detection limits, among others. Existing methods of data cleaning focus more on anomaly detection paying less attention to repairing them. Anomaly detection is a common approach used for filtering out dirty data. However, this approach could still result in unreliable data due to the incomplete data resulting from this process. This article presents an approach for repairing continuous sections of missing values in time series of air pollutant data. This study considers two regularized methods, Lasso and Ridge regression, to determine the number of data points forward and backward needed to estimate the value of a missing data point. Lasso presents superiority in front of Ridge regression to generate models for data imputation. The performance of the method was evaluated using the correlation coefficient (R2), the index agreement (d), the mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The proposed imputation method exhibited good results in terms of accuracy and precision in gaps of different lengths. This study proved that the proposed imputation method is useful to impute accurately missing values in air pollution contaminant datasets, and it has the potential to be applied to any dataset configured as a time series.",2019,2019 IEEE Latin American Conference on Computational Intelligence (LA-CCI)
A systematic review on model selection in high-dimensional regression,"Abstract High dimensional models are getting much attention from diverse research fields involving very many parameters with a moderate size of data. Model selection is an important issue in such a high dimensional data analysis. Recent literature on theoretical understanding of high dimensional models covers a wide range of penalized methods including LASSO and SCAD. This paper presents a systematic overview of the recent development in high dimensional statistical models. We provide a brief review on the recent development of theory, methods, and guideline on applications of several penalized methods. The review includes appropriate settings to be implemented and limitations along with potential solution for each of the reviewed method. In particular, we provide a systematic review of statistical theory of the high dimensional methods by considering a unified high-dimensional modeling framework together with high level conditions. This framework includes (generalized) linear regression and quantile regression as its special cases. We hope our review helps researchers in this field to have a better understanding of the area and provides useful information to future study.",2019,Journal of The Korean Statistical Society
Doubly Penalized Logistic Regression for Genomewide Association Studies with Linearly Structured Genetic Networks,"Title of thesis: DOUBLY PENALIZED LOGISTIC REGRESSION FOR GENOMEWIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES WITH LINEARLY STRUCTURED GENETIC NETWORKS Xia Li, Master of Public Health, 2012 Directed by: Assistant Professor Tongtong Wu Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics This research aims to integrate linear structures of genetic networks into genomewide analysis studies (GWAS). Lasso penalized logistic regression is ideally suited for continuous model selection in case-control disease gene mapping, especially when the number of predictor variables far exceeds the number of observations. But it fails to consider the structure of genetic networks. Imposing an additional weighted fused lasso can further remove irrelevant predictors. Nesterovâ€™s method is employed to handle the high dimensionality and complexity of genetic data. It also resolves the non-differentiability problem of the lasso and fused lasso penalties. In simulation studies, this proposed method shows advantages in some cases compared with lasso and fused lasso. We apply this method to the coeliac data on chromosome 8.

GLM+: An Efficient System for Generalized Linear Models,"Generalized linear models are widely used in data analysis and machine learning, especially in large-scale machine learning because of its simplicity and good performance. Generalized linear models include regression, like linear regression, lasso and classification, support vector machine and logistic regression. We have some popular optimization methods to solve them, including stochastic gradient descent, coordinate descent and alternating direction method of multipliers. Commonly used systems for generalized linear model use a single optimization algorithm to solve all kinds of models. However, experiments show that it is impossible to achieve a cost-effective solution for all kinds of generalized linear models due to the differences between different models. In order to resolve the problem, we propose a rule-based optimization algorithm selector to select the best optimization algorithm automatically. In this paper, we first broadly review the three commonly used optimization methods, stochastic gradient, coordinate descent, alternating direction method of multipliers, perform some experiments, and then propose a rule-based optimizer to guide the solving. We also design a new system, GLM+, based on the three rules we proposed with the two engineering techniques, parameter selection and optimization for sparse data. We conduct some experiments on real datasets and compare it with the commonly used machine learning systems, Shotgun and scikit-learn, to verify the effectiveness of our system GLM+. The experiments demonstrate that GLM+ can be 3-10Ã—, sometimes 20Ã—, faster than existing popular systems for generalized linear models.",2018,2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp)
Prediction magnetocrystalline anisotripy Fe-Rh thin films via machine leaning,"Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) was originally formulated for least squares models and this simple case reveals a substantial amount about the behavior of the estimator. It also shows that the coefficient estimates need not be unique if covariates are collinear. Using this Lasso technique, we analyze a magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy which is a long-standing issue in transition-metal thin films, expectially for Fe-Rh thin film systems on a MgO substrate. Our LASSO regression took advantage of the data obtained from first principles calculations for single slabs with seven atomic-layers of binary Fe-Rh films on MgO(001). In the case of Fe-Rh thin films, we have successfully found a linear behavior between the MCA energy and the anisotropy of orbital moments.",2019,arXiv: Materials Science

Adaptive model selection in a high-dimension multiphase quantile regression,"We propose a general adaptive LASSO method for an high-dimension quantile regression, which is very interesting when we know nothing about the first two moments of the model error. We first propose that the obtained estimators satisfy the oracle properties, which involves the relevant variable selection without crossing through the hypothesis test. Next, we study the proposed method when the (multiphase) model changes to unknown observations called change-points. Convergence rates of the change-points and of the regression parameters estimators in each phase are found. The sparsity of the adaptive LASSO quantile estimators of the regression parameters is not affected by the change-points estimation. If the phases number is unknown, a consistent criterion is proposed.

At the first step, nonlinear regression growth models (Logistic) were fitted to the weight-age of each animal, and on second step the parameter estimates of the Logistic model were used as phenotype in a regression model (Bayesian LASSO - BL) which covariates were given by SNP genotypes. This approach allows the estimation of GBV (Genomic Breeding Values) for weight at either time of growth trajectory, allowing also the production of genomic growth curves, which selected groups of individuals with larger growth efficiency. The simulated data set was constituted of 2,000 individuals (being 1,000 in the training and 1,000 in the validation population) each one with 453 SNP markers distributed along 5 chromosomes. The results indicated high efficiency of the BL method to predict GBV in the validation population using information from the training population (correlation coefficients varying between 0.79 and 0.93). The BL also presented high efficiency to detect QTL, once the most expressive estimated SNP effects were located at positions closed to true QTL position fixed in the simulation.",2013,
Use of Functional Movement Screen Scores to Predict Dynamic Balance in Physically Active Men and Women.,"Scudamore, EM, Stevens, SL, Fuller, DK, Coons, JM, and Morgan, DW. Use of functional movement screen scores to predict dynamic balance in physically active men and women. J Strength Cond Res 33(7): 1848-1854, 2019-The primary focus of this study was to determine whether scores obtained from the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) can predict dynamic balance in young, healthy adults. Thirty-four physically active participants completed the FMS, and balance was assessed using measures of composite reach (CR) distance and overall stability indices (OSI) derived from Y Balance and Biodex Balance System testing, respectively. Results indicated that higher overall FMS scores were associated with better CR and OSI, and participants with FMS composite scores greater than 14 exhibited better CR compared to those with composite scores less than or equal to 14. In addition, lasso penalized regression demonstrated that (a) scores of 2 on the deep squat and 3 on the trunk stability push-up movements predicted a greater CR and (b) higher shoulder mobility scores and a rotary stability score of 3 predicted better OSI. We conclude that dynamic balance in young, active men and women can be predicted by specific FMS item scores.",2019,Journal of strength and conditioning research
Regularized estimation of structural instability in factor models: The US macroeconomy and the Great Moderation,"This paper shows that the parsimoniously time-varying methodology of Callot and Kristensen (2015) can be applied to factor models. We apply this method to study macroeconomic instability in the US from 1959:1 to 2006:4 with a particular focus on the Great Moderation. Models with parsimoniously time-varying parameters are models with an unknown number of break points at unknown locations. The parameters are assumed to follow a random walk with a positive probability that an increment is exactly equal to zero so that the parameters do not vary at every point in time. The vector of increments, which is high dimensional by construction and sparse by assumption, is estimated using the Lasso. We apply this method to the estimation of static factor models and factor augmented autoregressions using a set of 190 quarterly observations of 144 US macroeconomic series from Stock and Watson (2009). We find that the parameters of both models exhibit a higher degree of instability in the period from 1970:1 to 1984:4 relative to the following 15 years. In our setting the Great Moderation appears as the gradual ending of a period of high structural instability that took place in the 1970s and early 1980s.",2015,
Genotype prediction of ATRX mutation in lower-grade gliomas using an MRI radiomics signature,"ObjectivesTo predict ATRX mutation status in patients with lower-grade gliomas using radiomic analysis.MethodsCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with lower-grade gliomas were randomly allocated into training (n = 63) and validation (n = 32) sets. An independent external-validation set (n = 91) was built based on the Chinese Genome Atlas (CGGA) database. After feature extraction, an ATRX-related signature was constructed. Subsequently, the radiomic signature was combined with a support vector machine to predict ATRX mutation status in training, validation and external-validation sets. Predictive performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Correlations between the selected features were also evaluated.ResultsNine radiomic features were screened as an ATRX-associated radiomic signature of lower-grade gliomas based on the LASSO regression model. All nine radiomic features were texture-associated (e.g. sum average and variance). The predictive efficiencies measured by the area under the curve were 94.0 %, 92.5 % and 72.5 % in the training, validation and external-validation sets, respectively. The overall correlations between the nine radiomic features were low in both TCGA and CGGA databases.ConclusionsUsing radiomic analysis, we achieved efficient prediction of ATRX genotype in lower-grade gliomas, and our model was effective in two independent databases.Key Pointsâ€¢ ATRX in lower-grade gliomas could be predicted using radiomic analysis.â€¢ The LASSO regression algorithm and SVM performed well in radiomic analysis.â€¢ Nine radiomic features were screened as an ATRX-predictive radiomic signature.â€¢ The machine-learning model for ATRX-prediction was validated by an independent database.",2017,European Radiology
"Community Health Clubs for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) improvement in Rural Burkina Faso",": 2.055_HRW How do international health electives impact medical students in their long term career paths? L. Buckvar-Keltz, E. Robinson, C. Gillespie, M. Hopkins; The Office of Student Affairs, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA, Global Health Initiatives, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA, Division of Education Quality, Institute for Innovations in Medical Education, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA Program/Project Purpose: The New York University School of Medicine (NYUSOM) has been engaging medical students in global health across their years in medical school through itsâ€™ International Health Program (IHP) since 2002. All students in good academic standing are supported to participate in culturally meaningful and socially relevant research in any location that meets US State Department safe travel advisories. Students can also participate in self-funded clinical rotations. The program aims to increase the cultural competency of medical graduates as they enter the workforce to serve an increasingly diverse patient population. Our assumption was that IHP participants would have increased cultural competency, increased engagement with underserved populations, and increased incorporation of global health in their career paths. Structure/Method/Design: To understand the impact of this program we conducted a simple cross-sectional cohort study of graduates of the program from 2002 to 2012. Survey questions included demographic data as well as subjective impact of the IHP program on their residency and career choices. Outcome & Evaluation: We received 49 responses out of 213 surveys distributed by email to past participants of the IHP. Analysis of the data showed that international experiences later in medical school, rather than earlier, had a higher impact on career plans (mean of 2.70 verses mean of 2.00). Moreover, electives with both research and clinical components positively impacted career plans. Clinical rotations appeared to have slightly more impact on cultural competency than research rotations (mean of 3.82 verses mean of 3.39). Students who had not studied abroad previously (n 1â„4 24) reported that IHP had a greater impact on cultural competence, commitment to global health, and commitment to caring for the under-served than those who had previously studied abroad (n 1â„4 24). Going Forward: International heath experiences for medical students appear to have a significant impact on career paths as well as improving cultural competency. These findings can potentially benefit human resources for health by increasing US graduates long-term engagement in global public health and for working with underserved populations. We feel there is also strong argument for supporting first time international experiences for medical students. Funding: Office of Student Affairs at the NYU School ofMedicine. Abstract #: 2.056_HRW: 2.056_HRW Community Health Clubs for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) improvement in Rural Burkina Faso M. Niaone, S. Bendjemil, J. Rosenfeld, R. Berggren; The Centre Muraz, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, West Africa, The Center for Medical Humanities & Ethics, School of Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA Purpose: Only 6.7% of Burkina Fasoâ€™s people have access to improved sanitation. Risk for food, vector or waterborne disease is high: diarrhea, malaria, and helminths remain preventable causes of mortality and poverty. In December 2014 we piloted Community Health Clubs for WASH behavior change in a village of 2000. The aims of this project are to: 1. Improve WASH-related knowledge and behaviors; 2. Prevent WASH-related diseases; 3. Create enduring community-based social structures with capacity to sustain health gains and nurture sustainable development. Design: A knowledge and practices survey of 70 randomly selected family compounds was conducted before project implementation. Village leaders identified candidate facilitators from the community. We trained 19 facilitators in a picture-based WASH curriculum Human Resources and Workforce A n n a l s o f G l o b a l H e a l t h , V O L . 8 2 , N O . 3 , 2 0 1 6 M a yeJ u n e 2 0 1 6 : 4 7 3 â€“ 5 1 0 496 starting with germ theory and progressing to hand washing, water safety, human waste management, and vector control. Facilitators recruited 9 health clubs with over 650 members. Nearly 100% of club members completed the 22-week program, documented by membership cards recording attendance and WASH practices. The household survey will be repeated in December 2015. This evaluation was approved by the UT Health Science Center Institutional Review Board (HSC20140088e). Outcomes: Survey respondents were mostly female (57%), had not attended school (70%), and had a median age of 51. Most (67%) obtained drinking water from protected communal hand-pumps. Although 81% did not treat water, 10% of those drinking river water used crude filters. 83% did not own a latrine. Asked to identify 5 key opportunities for hand washing, 45% could provide no answer, while 2% provided >3 correct answers. Only 7% reported hand-washing after defecation. Appropriate tests will analyze knowledge; drinking water, defecation and hand washing behaviors; and diarrhea incidence after the intervention. Regressions will describe WASH knowledge and behavior predictors. Going Forward: We demonstrate feasibility of implementing a lowcost, participatory education program with high retention rates to prevent WASH-related illnesses in rural Burkina Faso. This approach could also defend against other health threats in West Africa, including Ebola. Next year 2 villages will join the program and outcomes will be measured using household inventories (behavioral observation tool) and household registers monitoring morbidity and mortality. Club and non-Club villages will eventually be compared.

This program aligns with EqualHealthâ€™s (EQ) vision of a Haitian medical education system that is high-quality, Haitian-led, and filled with opportunity. It also draws upon the resources of the Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital (BWH), with its long record of innovation and leadership in medical education and global health. Structure/Method/Design: In August 2015, two Haitian physicians were selected as EQâ€™s inaugural fellows via a competitive process. Their employing hospitals in Haiti agreed to their participation in a yearlong fellowship that includes a three-month, Boston-based curriculum, and guaranteed them the support necessary to implement new education programs upon return. The Boston-based curriculum includes: a weekly series of didactic sessions on the principles of effective teaching; participation in regular BWH and Harvard Medical School educational activities, such as teaching conference presentations and rounds with master educators; and assorted professional development opportunities at other Harvard institutions. For the remaining nine months, the fellows return to their Haitian teaching hospitals to serve as clinician educators, during which they co-teach courses taught by visiting teachers at their site and receive ongoing mentorship and leadership training from EQ staff. Outcome & Evaluation: The Fellowship is being evaluated using pre/post testing, scoring of videotaped teaching sessions by blinded reviewers, self-assessment questionnaires, regular feedback interviews, and other modalities. Initial feedback from the fellows has been strongly positive overall, with teaching conferences, Harvard Business School classes, and observed teaching experiences receiving special mention. Among the challenges faced thus far have been the language barrier; the logistics of moving the fellows between multiple teaching sites; and the creation of sufficient opportunities for the fellows to practice teaching within the Boston curriculum. Going Forward: The Fellowship is an innovative professional development opportunity for Haitian clinician educators, an intensive learning experience drawing on five Harvard institutions and involving close partnership with Haiti-based teaching hospitals. The Fellowship represents a new model of partnership for development of global medical education systems. Funding: The Fellowship is funded via private donations to EQ.
