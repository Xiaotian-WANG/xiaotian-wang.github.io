Interval multiple-output soft sensors development with capacity control for wastewater treatment applications: A comparative study,"Abstract Soft-sensor is the most common strategy to predict hard-to-measure variables in the wastewater treatment processes. However, existence of a large number of hard-to-measure variables always renders a generic single-output soft-sensor inadequate. This study developed multi-output soft-sensors using Multivariate Linear Regression model (MLR), Multivariate Relevant Vector Machine (MRVM) and Multivariate Gaussian Processes Regression (MGPR) models aiming to predict multiple hard-to-measure variables simultaneously and to capture the joint distribution of the response variables. This, in turn, ensures that the proposed soft-sensors are not just able to obtain prediction values, but also to indicate the credibility of information for hard-to-measure quantities. To further compromise the computational overhead of multi-output soft-sensors, improved Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) are proposed to reduce the dimensions of data, thereby alleviating the complexity of predicted models. The proposed methodologies were firstly demonstrated by applying the design algorithm to a wastewater plant (WWTP) simulated with the well-established model, BSM1, then extended to a full-scale WWTP with data collecting from the field. Results showed that the proposed strategy significantly improved the prediction performance.",2019,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems
Analyzing the amperometric response of a glucose oxidase sensor applying mathematical models,"Background: The biosensors are analytical devices combining a bioreceptor and a physicochemical transducer to translate the signal resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element into an electrical reading. The technological attractiveness of the biosensors resides in their high sensitivity, continuous measuring capabilities, low cost, and precision. An important and promising area of biosensors application is the associated with blood glucose levels monitoring in diabetic patients. However, accuracy and stability issues are still under development, impeding the more widespread offering of glucose biosensors in the market. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the biosensors technology by analyzing the amperometric response to glucose of a typical glucose oxidase-based sensor of second generation, applying mathematical models. 
 
Methods: The amperometric response of the glucose oxidase-based electrochemical sensor of second generation was analyzed under different conditions such as temperature, pH, mediatorsâ€™ and substrateâ€™s concentrations through statistical learning methods from a regression perspective. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), LASSO and RIDGE Regression and Classification and Regression (CART) were the algorithms selected to achieve the regression task. 
 
Results: The reported experimental results show a promising very low prediction error of the biosensor output by using Neural Networks and Classification and Regression Trees. It is also shown that the relationship between predictors, i.e. features or variables- and response-target variable- corresponds to a nonlinear behavior. 
 
Conclusion: A final CART and a Neural Network models are presented as a simple solutions that can be solidly constructed in order to predict the amperometric response of a glucose oxidase sensor. The experimental proposal and conditions offered in this paper could be applied for other scenarios in the wide spectrum of biosensing technology.",2016,Current Analytical Chemistry
Effectiveness of ensemble machine learning over the conventional multivariable linear regression models,"This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble machine learning algorithms over the conventional multivariable linear regression models including Ordinary Least Squares, Robust Linear Model, and Lasso Model. The ensemble machine learning algorithms include Adaboost, Random-Forest, Bagging, Extremely Randomized Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Extra Trees Regressor. With the progress of open sources, a variety of algorithms are available and they can be easily compared by using open source Python libraries from the viewpoint of prediction accuracies using R-squared.

High-dimensional additive hazards models and the Lasso,"Abstract: We consider a general high-dimensional additive hazards model in a non-asymptotic setting, including regression for censored-data. In this context, we consider a Lasso estimator with a fully data-driven `1 penalization, which is tuned for the estimation problem at hand. We prove sharp oracle inequalities for this estimator. Our analysis involves a new â€œdata-drivenâ€ Bernsteinâ€™s inequality, that is of independent interest, where the predictable variation is replaced by the optional variation.",2011,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Multilevel Survival Analysis with Structured Penalties for Imaging Genetics data,"Predicting the future occurrence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a topic of active research. Many papers have formulated this question as a classification problem: one considers a fixed time of conversion and aims to discriminate between the patients who have converted to AD at that time and those who have not. However, a clinically more relevant question is to predict the date at which a patient to AD. Survival analysis is an adequate statistical framework for such a task. Multimodal data (imaging and genetic) provide complementary information for the prediction. While imaging data provides an estimate of the current patient's state, genetic variants can be associated to the speed of progression to AD. Although they do not provide the same type of information, most papers in classification or regression put imaging and genetic variables on the same level in order to predict the current or future patient's state. In this work, we propose a survival model using multimodal data to estimate the conversion date to AD, by considering joint effects between the imaging and genetic modalities. We introduce an adapted penalty in the survival model, the group lasso penalty, over joint groups of genes and brain regions. The model is evaluated on genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and imaging (anatomical MRI measures) data from the ADNI database, and compared to a standard Cox model.",2020,
Application of artificial neural networks to wave load prediction for coastal bridges,"Predicting quickly and accurately the wave forces on the bridge superstructures from wave height and bridge structure information is important in facilitating bridge design and estimating potential damages to coastal bridges by hurricanes and tsunamis for disaster management. This study proposes a machine learning approach with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as an alternative and competitive method for wave force prediction in contrast to the conventional approaches of laboratory tests and numerical simulations which are often expensive and time consuming. At first, we exploit the available Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation models/software to generate the ""ground-truth"" data for ANN training. A comparison study among eight linear and nonlinear regression models including ANN and Support Vector Regression and LASSO shows that ANN outperforms all other models in terms of prediction accuracy. Various tuning experiments have been carried out in selecting an optimal network structure. We also studied the effect of input data standardization and our results indicate that input data standardization is beneficial to improve the prediction performance of ANN. Finally, the trained network structures are successfully evaluated with appreciable correlation coefficients and small root mean square errors. The results show that the proposed ANN approach is robust and capable of capturing the physical complexities for the wave force on deck prediction task.",2017,
High dimensional data regression using Lasso model and neural networks with random weights,"This paper aims to develop a framework for high dimensional data regression, where the model interpretation and prediction accuracy are regularized. Taking application background into account, we supposed that the collected samples for building learner models are expensive and limited. Our technical contributions include the generation of ensemble features (EF) using Lasso models with some selective regularizing factors estimated via a cross-validation procedure; and predictive model building using neural networks with random weights, where the weights and biases of the hidden nodes are assigned randomly in a specific interval, and the output weights are evaluated analytically by a regularized least square method. Experiments with comparisons on estimating protein content of milk from its NMR spectrum are carried out by a data set with 31,570 dimensions (spectrum size) and 120 samples. Results demonstrate that our proposed solution for data regression problems with small samples and high dimensionality is promising, and the learning system performs robustly with respect to a key parameter setting in the ensemble feature generation.",2016,Inf.

An experimental validation of genomic selection in octoploid strawberry,"The primary goal of genomic selection is to increase genetic gains for complex traits by predicting performance of individuals for which phenotypic data are not available. The objective of this study was to experimentally evaluate the potential of genomic selection in strawberry breeding and to define a strategy for its implementation. Four clonally replicated field trials, two in each of 2 years comprised of a total of 1628 individuals, were established in 2013â€“2014 and 2014â€“2015. Five complex yield and fruit quality traits with moderate to low heritability were assessed in each trial. High-density genotyping was performed with the Affymetrix Axiom IStraw90 single-nucleotide polymorphism array, and 17â€‰479 polymorphic markers were chosen for analysis. Several methods were compared, including Genomic BLUP, Bayes B, Bayes C, Bayesian LASSO Regression, Bayesian Ridge Regression and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. Cross-validation within training populations resulted in higher values than for true validations across trials. For true validations, Bayes B gave the highest predictive abilities on average and also the highest selection efficiencies, particularly for yield traits that were the lowest heritability traits. Selection efficiencies using Bayes B for parent selection ranged from 74% for average fruit weight to 34% for early marketable yield. A breeding strategy is proposed in which advanced selection trials are utilized as training populations and in which genomic selection can reduce the breeding cycle from 3 to 2 years for a subset of untested parents based on their predicted genomic breeding values.",2017,Horticulture Research
Variable Selection in Restricted Linear Regression Models,"The use of prior information in the linear regression is well known to provide more efficient estimators of regression coefficients. The methods of non-stochastic restricted regression estimation proposed by Theil and Goldberger (1961) are preferred when prior information is available. In this study, we will consider parameter estimation and the variable selection in non-stochastic restricted linear regression model, using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method introduced by Tibshirani (1996). A small simulation study and real data example are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed method for dealing with the variable selection and the parameter estimation in restricted linear regression models.",2017,arXiv: Applications
Penalized Linear Unbiased Selection,"We introduce MC+, a fast, continuous, nearly unbiased, and accurate method of penalized variable selection in high-dimensional linear regression. The LASSO is fast and continuous, but biased. The bias of the LASSO interferes with variable selection. Subset selection is unbiased but computationally costly. The MC+ has two elements: a minimax concave penalty (MCP) and a penalized linear unbiased selection (PLUS) algorithm. The MCP provides the minimum non-convexity of the penalized loss given the level of bias. The PLUS computes multiple local minimizers of a possibly non-convex penalized loss function in certain main branch of the graph of such solutions. Its output is a continuous piecewise linear path encompassing from the origin to an optimal solution for zero penalty. We prove that for a universal penalty level, the MC+ has high probability of correct selection under much weaker conditions compared with existing results for the LASSO for large n and p, including the case of p â‰« n. We provide estimates of the noise level for proper choice of the penalty level. We choose the sparsest solution within the PLUS path for a given penalty level. We derive degrees of freedom and Cp-type risk estimates for general penalized LSE, including the LASSO estimator, and prove their unbiasedness. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the continuity of the penalized LSE under general sub-square penalties. Simulation results overwhelmingly support our claim of superior variable selection properties and demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed method.",2007,
Genome-wide prediction using Bayesian additive regression trees,"BackgroundThe goal of genome-wide prediction (GWP) is to predict phenotypes based on marker genotypes, often obtained through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips. The major problem with GWP is high-dimensional data from many thousands of SNPs scored on several thousands of individuals. A large number of methods have been developed for GWP, which are mostly parametric methods that assume statistical linearity and only additive genetic effects. The Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) method was recently proposed and is based on the sum of nonparametric regression trees with the priors being used to regularize the parameters. Each regression tree is based on a recursive binary partitioning of the predictor space that approximates an unknown function, which will automatically model nonlinearities within SNPs (dominance) and interactions between SNPs (epistasis). In this study, we introduced BART and compared its predictive performance with that of the LASSO, Bayesian LASSO (BLASSO), genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) regression and random forest (RF) methods.ResultsTests on the QTLMAS2010 simulated data, which are mainly based on additive genetic effects, show that cross-validated optimization of BART provides a smaller prediction error than the RF, BLASSO, GBLUP and RKHS methods, and is almost as accurate as the LASSO method. If dominance and epistasis effects are added to the QTLMAS2010 data, the accuracy of BART relative to the other methods was increased. We also showed that BART can produce importance measures on the SNPs through variable inclusion proportions. In evaluations using real data on pigs, the prediction error was smaller with BART than with the other methods.ConclusionsBART was shown to be an accurate method for GWP, in which the regression trees guarantee a very sparse representation of additive and complex non-additive genetic effects. Moreover, the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm with Bayesian back-fitting provides a computationally efficient procedure that is suitable for high-dimensional genomic data.",2016,"Genetics, Selection, Evolution : GSE"
â„“1-Penalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models for BCI,"A recently proposed novel statistical model estimates population effects and individual variability between subgroups simultaneously, by extending Lasso methods. We apply this l1-penalized linear regression mixed-effects model to a large scale real world problem: by exploiting a large set of brain computer interface data we are able to obtain a subject-independent classifier that compares favorably with prior zero-training algorithms. This unifying model inherently compensates shifts in the input space attributed to the individuality of a subject. In particular we are now able to differentiate within-subject and between-subject variability. A deeper understanding both of the underlying statistical and physiological structure of the data is gained.",2011,
Parsimonious sound field synthesis using compressive sampling,"Reproducing a sampled sound field over a two-dimensional area using an array of loudspeakers is a problem with well-appreciated applications to acoustics and ultrasound treatement. Loudspeaker signal design has traditionally relied on a (possibly regularized) least-squares criterion. The fresh look advocated here, permeates benefits from advances in variable selection and compressive sampling by casting the sound field synthesis as a sparse linear regression problem that is solved by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). Analysis and simulations demonstrate that the novel approach exhibits superb performance even for under-sampled sound fields, where least-squares methods yield inconsistent field reproduction. In addition, Lasso-based synthesis enables judicious placement of parsimonious loudspeaker arrays.",2009,2009 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics
Learning algorithms for sparse classification,"This thesis deals with the development of estimation algorithms with embedded feature selection the context of high dimensional data, in the supervised and unsupervised frameworks. The contributions of this work are materialized by two algorithms, GLOSS for the supervised domain and Mix-GLOSS for unsupervised counterpart. Both algorithms are based on the resolution of optimal scoring regression regularized with a quadratic formulation of the group-Lasso penalty which encourages the removal of uninformative features. The theoretical foundations that prove that a group-Lasso penalized optimal scoring regression can be used to solve a linear discriminant analysis bave been firstly developed in this work. The theory that adapts this technique to the unsupervised domain by means of the EM algorithm is not new, but it has never been clearly exposed for a sparsity-inducing penalty. This thesis solidly demonstrates that the utilization of group-Lasso penalized optimal scoring regression inside an EM algorithm is possible. Our algorithms have been tested with real and artificial high dimensional databases with impressive resuits from the point of view of the parsimony without compromising prediction performances.",2013,
Robust adaptive Lasso for variable selection,"ABSTRACT The adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and least absolute deviation (LAD)-Lasso are two attractive shrinkage methods for simultaneous variable selection and regression parameter estimation. While the adaptive Lasso is efficient for small magnitude errors, LAD-Lasso is robust against heavy-tailed errors and severe outliers. In this article, we consider a data-driven convex combination of these two modern procedures to produce a robust adaptive Lasso, which not only enjoys the oracle properties, but synthesizes the advantages of the adaptive Lasso and LAD-Lasso. It fully adapts to different error structures including the infinite variance case and automatically chooses the optimal weight to achieve both robustness and high efficiency. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate a good finite sample performance of the robust adaptive Lasso. Two data sets are analyzed to illustrate the practical use of the procedure.",2017,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
Predicting Overall Survival in Patients with Metastatic Rectal Cancer: a Machine Learning Approach,"A significant proportion of patients with rectal cancer will present with synchronous metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Overall survival (OS) for these patients are highly variable and previous attempts to build predictive models often have low predictive power, with concordance indexes (c-index) less than 0.70. Using the National Cancer Database (2010â€“2014), we identified patients with synchronous metastatic rectal cancer. The data was split into a training dataset (diagnosis years 2010â€“2012), which was used to build the machine learning model, and a testing dataset (diagnosis years 2013â€“2014), which was used to externally validate the model. A nomogram predicting 3-year OS was created using Cox proportional hazard regression with lasso penalization. Predictors were selected based on clinical significance and availability in NCDB. Performance of the machine learning model was assessed by c-index. A total of 4098 and 3107 patients were used to construct and validate the nomogram, respectively. Internally validated c-indexes at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.816 (95% CI 0.813â€“0.818), 0.789 (95% CI 0.786â€“0.790), and 0.778 (95% CI 0.775â€“0.780), respectively. External validated c-indexes at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.811, 0.779, and 0.778, respectively. There is wide variability in the OS for patients with metastatic rectal cancer, making accurate predictions difficult. However, using machine learning techniques, more accurate models can be built. This will aid patients and clinicians in setting expectations and making clinical decisions in this group of challenging patients.",2019,Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery
"Tree species richness predicted using a spatial environmental model including forest area and frost frequency, eastern USA","Assessing geographic patterns of species richness is essential to develop biological conservation as well as to understand the processes that shape these patterns. We aim to improve geographic prediction of tree species richness (TSR) across eastern USA by using: 1) gridded point-sample data rather than spatially generalized range maps for the TSR outcome variable, 2) new predictor variables (forest area FA; mean frost day frequency MFDF) and 3) regression models that account for spatial autocorrelation. TSR was estimated in 50 km by 50 km grids using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) point-sample data. Eighteen environmental predictor variables were employed, with the most effective set selected by a LASSO that reduced multicollinearity. Those predictors were then employed in Generalized linear models (GLMs), and in Eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) models that accounted for spatial autocorrelation. Models were evaluated by model fit statistics, spatial patterns of TSR predictions, and spatial autocorrelation. Our results showed gridded TSR was best-predicted by the ESF model that used, in descending order of influence: precipitation seasonality, mean precipitation in the driest quarter, FA, and MFDF. ESF models, by accounting for spatial autocorrelation, outperformed GLMs regardless of the predictors employed, as indicated by percent deviance explained and spatial autocorrelation of residuals. Small regions with low TSR, such as the Midwest prairie peninsula, were successfully predicted by ESF models, but not by GLMs or other studies. Gridded TSR in Florida was only correctly predicted by the ESF model with FA and MFDF, and was over-predicted by all other models.",2018,PLoS ONE
Predicting Profile Soil Properties with Reflectance Spectra via Bayesian Covariate-Assisted External Parameter Orthogonalization,"In situ, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) profile soil sensors have the potential to provide both rapid and high-resolution prediction of multiple soil properties for precision agriculture, soil health assessment, and other applications related to environmental protection and agronomic sustainability. However, the effects of soil moisture, other environmental factors, and artefacts of the in-field spectral data collection process often hamper the utility of in situ DRS data. Various processing and modeling techniques have been developed to overcome these challenges, including external parameter orthogonalization (EPO) transformation of the spectra. In addition, Bayesian modeling approaches may improve prediction over traditional partial least squares (PLS) regression. The objectives of this study were to predict soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and texture fractions using a large, regional dataset of in situ profile DRS spectra and compare the performance of (1) traditional PLS analysis, (2) PLS on EPO-transformed spectra (PLS-EPO), (3) PLS-EPO with the Bayesian Lasso (PLS-EPO-BL), and (4) covariate-assisted PLS-EPO-BL models. In this study, soil cores and in situ profile DRS spectrometer scans were obtained to ~1 m depth from 22 fields across Missouri and Indiana, USA. In the laboratory, soil cores were split by horizon, air-dried, and sieved (<2 mm) for a total of 708 samples. Soil properties were measured and DRS spectra were collected on these air-dried soil samples. The data were randomly split into training (n = 308), testing (n = 200), and EPO calibration (n = 200) sets, and soil textural class was used as the categorical covariate in the Bayesian models. Model performance was evaluated using the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). For the prediction of soil properties using a model trained on dry spectra and tested on field moist spectra, the PLS-EPO transformation dramatically improved model performance relative to PLS alone, reducing RMSEP by 66% and 53% for SOC and TN, respectively, and by 76%, 91%, and 87% for clay, silt, and sand, respectively. The addition of the Bayesian Lasso further reduced RMSEP by 4â»11% across soil properties, and the categorical covariate reduced RMSEP by another 2â»9%. Overall, this study illustrates the strength of the combination of EPO spectral transformation paired with Bayesian modeling techniques to overcome environmental factors and in-field data collection artefacts when using in situ DRS data, and highlights the potential for in-field DRS spectroscopy as a tool for rapid, high-resolution prediction of soil properties.",2018,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)"
Advanced forecasting methods for renewable generation and loads in modern power systems,"The PhD Thesis deals with the problem of forecasting in power systems, i.e., a wide topic that today covers many and many needs, and that is universally acknowledged to require further deep research efforts. 
After a brief discussion on the classification of forecasting systems and on the methods that are currently available in literature for forecasting electrical variables, stressing pros and cons of each approach, the PhD Thesis provides four contributes to the state of the art on forecasting in power systems where literature is somehow weak. 
The first provided contribute is a Bayesian-based probabilistic method to forecast photovoltaic (PV) power in short-term scenarios. Parameters of the predictive distributions are estimated by means of an exogenous linear regression model and through the Bayesian inference of past observations. 
The second provided contribute is a probabilistic competitive ensemble method once again to forecast PV power in short-term scenarios. The idea is to improve the quality of forecasts obtained through some individual probabilistic predictors, by combining them in a probabilistic competitive approach based on a linear pooling of predictive cumulative density functions. A multi-objective optimization method is proposed in order to guarantee elevate sharpness and reliability characteristics of the predictive distribution. 
The third contribute is aimed to the development of a deterministic industrial load forecasting method suitable in short-term scenarios, at both aggregated and single-load levels, and for both active and reactive powers. The deterministic industrial load forecasting method is based on multiple linear regression and support vector regression models, selected by means of 10-fold cross-validation or lasso analysis.
The fourth contribute provides advanced PDFs for the statistical characterization of Extreme Wind Speeds (EWS). 
In particular, the PDFs proposed in the PhD Thesis are an Inverse Burr distribution and a mixture Inverse Burr â€“ Inverse Weibull distribution. The mixture of an Inverse Burr and an Inverse Weibull distribution allows to increase the versatility of the tool, although increasing the number of parameters to be estimated. This complicates the parameter estimation process, since traditional techniques such as the maximum likelihood estimation suffer from convergence problems. Therefore, an expectation-maximization procedure is specifically developed for the parameter estimation.
All of the contributes presented in the PhD Thesis are tested on actual data, and compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks to assess the suitability of each proposal.",2017,
Application of Feature Selection Method to Error Factor Extraction of Multifunction Peripheral,"Multifunction peripheral (MFP) manufacturers provide customers with remote maintenance services, such as supplies provision and automatic firmware updates, to lower customer burdens and to avoid device downtime. Such remote services are required for maintenance so that Japanese machine manufacturers can deliver products to foreign markets, because service bases in overseas locales must cover broader geographical areas than those in Japan. When MFP devices experience a fault, they generally alert users of an error. Although some faults can be solved remotely, there are faults that require an engineer to perform on-site actions. To repair them on-site efficiently, online investigation and pre-assessment of fault factors will be effective. In this paper, we apply the Group Lasso regularization method for logistic regression to select features determined as error factors. We evaluate the engine on two kinds of error examples: those frequently causing alerts in MFP models in the past, and those causing alerts due to part wear. This engine is expected to help engineers determine causal factors of errors.",2019,2019 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM)
On the Nonnegative Garrote Estimator,"We study the nonnegative garrote estimator from three different aspects: computation, consistency and flexibility. We show that the nonnegative garrote estimate has a piecewise linear solution path. Using this fact, we propose an efficient algorithm for computing the whole solution path for the nonnegative garrote estimate. We also show that the nonnegative garrote has the nice property that with probability tending to one, the solution path contains an estimate that correctly identifies the set of important variables and is consistent for the coefficients of the important variables. Such property is valid for another popular variable selection method, LASSO, only under restrictive conditions. We propose a slight modification that retains the attractive properties of the original nonnegative garrote, but is more widely applicable. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed estimator, we consider an extension to the nonparametric regression setup. Simulations and a real example show that the proposed method is very competitive in terms of variable selection and estimation accuracy when compared with other variable selection and estimation methods.",2005,
Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection among Women with Genital Infections in Burkina Faso,"Summary: This study reports the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among gynaecological outpatients presenting at the Bobo-Dioulasso Hospital (Burkina Faso) with genital infections and examines the factors associated with HIV infection in this population. Of 245 eligible non-pregnant women, 220 consented to participate in the study. Seventy-seven per cent had sexually transmitted infections. The most common were: Trichomonas vaginalis (28%), Chlamydia trachomatis (27%), bacterial vaginosis (20%), Candida albicans (17%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (11%). The prevalence of HIV infection was 42% (95% ci. 35.3, 48.3). Logistic regression analyses revealed Neisseria gonorrhoeae to be the only STD significantly associated with infection with HIV (P = 0.04). A sedimentation rate greater than or equal to 100 mm in the first hour was also associated with HIV infection (P < 0.001). Women consulting for genital infections constitute a high risk group for HIV infection and other STDs. Management of these women should focus on the early diagnosis and treatment of STDs.",1995,International Journal of STD & AIDS
Sparse Linear Models and Two-Stage Estimation in High-Dimensional Settings with Possibly Many Endogenous Regressors,"This paper explores the validity of the two-stage estimation procedure for sparse linear models in high-dimensional settings with possibly many endogenous regressors. In particular, the number of endogenous regressors in the main equation and the instruments in the first-stage equations can grow with and exceed the sample size n. The analysis concerns the exact sparsity case, i.e., the maximum number of non-zero components in the vectors of parameters in the first-stage equations, k1, and the number of non-zero components in the vector of parameters in the second-stage equation, k2, are allowed to grow with n but slowly compared to n. I consider the high-dimensional version of the two-stage least square estimator where one obtains the fitted regressors from the first-stage regression by a least square estimator with l_1-regularization (the Lasso or Dantzig selector) when the first-stage regression concerns a large number of instruments relative to n, and then construct a similar estimator using these fitted regressors in the second-stage regression. The main theoretical results of this paper are non-asymptotic bounds from which I establish sufficient scaling conditions on the sample size for estimation consistency in l_2-norm and variable-selection consistency. A technical issue regarding the so-called ""restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition"" for estimation consistency and the ""mutual incoherence (MI) condition"" for selection consistency arises in the two-stage estimation from allowing the number of regressors in the main equation to exceed n and this paper provides analysis to verify these RE and MI conditions. Depending on the underlying assumptions, the upper bounds on the l_2-error and the sample size required to obtain these consistency results differ by factors involving k1 and/or k2. Simulations are conducted to gain insight on the finite sample performance.",2013,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Machine Learning of Energetic Material Properties,"In this work, we discuss use of machine learning techniques for rapid prediction of detonation properties including explosive energy, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure. Further, analysis is applied to individual molecules in order to explore the contribution of bonding motifs to these properties. Feature descriptors evaluated include Morgan fingerprints, E-state vectors, a custom ""sum over bonds"" descriptor, and coulomb matrices. Algorithms discussed include kernel ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (""LASSO"") regression, Gaussian process regression, and the multi-layer perceptron (a neural network). Effects of regularization, kernel selection, network parameters, and dimensionality reduction are discussed. We determine that even when using a small training set, non-linear regression methods may create models within a useful error tolerance for screening of materials.",2018,arXiv: Materials Science
Optimistic lower bounds for convex regularized least-squares,"Minimax lower bounds are pessimistic in nature: for any given estimator, minimax lower bounds yield the existence of a worst-case target vector $\beta^*_{worst}$ for which the prediction error of the given estimator is bounded from below. However, minimax lower bounds shed no light on the prediction error of the given estimator for target vectors different than $\beta^*_{worst}$. A characterization of the prediction error of any convex regularized least-squares is given. This characterization provide both a lower bound and an upper bound on the prediction error. This produces lower bounds that are applicable for any target vector and not only for a single, worst-case $\beta^*_{worst}$. Finally, these lower and upper bounds on the prediction error are applied to the Lasso is sparse linear regression. We obtain a lower bound involving the compatibility constant for any tuning parameter, matching upper and lower bounds for the universal choice of the tuning parameter, and a lower bound for the Lasso with small tuning parameter.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Multistep model for predicting upper-limb 3D isometric force application from pre-movement electrocorticographic features,"Neural correlates of movement planning onset and direction may be present in human electrocorticography in the signal dynamics of both motor and non-motor cortical regions. We use a three-stage model of jPCA reduced-rank hidden Markov model (jPCA-RR-HMM), regularized shrunken-centroid discriminant analysis (RDA), and LASSO regression to extract direction-sensitive planning information and movement onset in an upper-limb 3D isometric force task in a human subject. This mode achieves a relatively high true positive force-onset prediction rate of 60% within 250ms, and an above-chance 36% accuracy (17% chance) in predicting one of six planned 3D directions of isometric force using pre-movement signals. We also find direction-distinguishing information up to 400ms before force onset in the pre-movement signals, captured by electrodes placed over the limb-ipsilateral dorsal premotor regions. This approach can contribute to more accurate decoding of higher-level movement goals, at earlier timescales, and inform sensor placement. Our results also contribute to further understanding of the spatiotemporal features of human motor planning.",2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
1486: Go-farther Score Model to Predict Survival after Ihca with Moderate or Less Cerebral Dysfunction,"Learning Objectives: Clinicians rely on their knowledge of prognosis to support patient decision-making regarding whether to enact Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAPCR) orders. The Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) Score is a well-validated tool that predicts survival after In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (IHCA) with no cerebral dysfunction (CPC â‰¤ 1). However, patients may consider survival with moderate cerebral dysfunction acceptable (CPC â‰¤ 2). Our objective was to validate the ability of the GO-FAR score to identify patients unlikely to survive IHCA with CPC â‰¤ 2 and to develop a modified GO-FAR score to accurately predict survival after IHCA with CPC â‰¤ 2. Methods: 54,425 inpatients with IHCA from 2012 2017. First, validation of the GO-FAR Score was attempted using survival with CPC â‰¤ 2. Next, the data were divided into training (44%), test (22%), and validation (34%) sets. Univariate analysis was used to identify variables with >3% absolute difference in survival with CPC â‰¤ 2, which were carried forward to a multivariate analysis. A final logistic regression model was created using Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Candidate decision models were assessed using the test dataset to select the most parsimonious model that best classified patients as having a very poor (â‰¤5%), poor (6%10%), average (11%30%), or above average (>30%) likelihood of survival after CPR for IHCA with CPC â‰¤ 2. Results: The original GO FAR Score performed poorly for CPC â‰¤ 2. In the univariate model, age > 85, admission CPC < 2, and non-surgical admission had the largest association with outcome (-12.1%, -14.4%, and -18%, respectively). 13 variables were included in the logistic regression analysis. The final model accurately categorized 24.8% of patients with below average likelihood of CPC â‰¤ 2 in the training set, versus 21.5% and 22.4% in the testing and validation sets. Conclusions: The shared decision-making process must balance the patientâ€™s goals and values for medical treatment with an accurate estimate of a patientâ€™s chance of survival with an acceptable functional outcome. The GO-FARTHER Score extends the relevance of the GO-FAR Score to those patients with CPC â‰¤ 2.",2019,Critical Care Medicine
Multi-label learning with prior knowledge for facial expression analysis,"Abstract Facial expression is one of the most expressive ways to display human emotions. Facial expression analysis (FEA) has been broadly studied in the past decades. In our daily life, few of the facial expressions are exactly one of the predefined affective states but are blends of several basic expressions. Even though the concept of â€˜blended emotionsâ€™ has been proposed years ago, most researchers did not deal with FEA as a multiple outputs problem yet. In this paper, multi-label learning algorithm for FEA is proposed to solve this problem. Firstly, to depict facial expressions more effectively, we model FEA as a multi-label problem, which depicts all facial expressions with multiple continuous values and labels of predefined affective states. Secondly, in order to model FEA jointly with multiple outputs, multi-label Group Lasso regularized maximum margin classifier (GLMM) and Group Lasso regularized regression (GLR) algorithms are proposed which can analyze all facial expressions at one time instead of modeling as a binary learning problem. Thirdly, to improve the effectiveness of our proposed model used in video sequences, GLR is further extended to be a Total Variation and Group Lasso based regression model (GLTV) which adds a prior term (Total Variation term) in the original model. JAFFE dataset and the extended Cohn Kanade (CK+) dataset have been used to verify the superior performance of our approaches with common used criterions in multi-label classification and regression realms.",2015,Neurocomputing
Accuracy of genomic predictions in Bos indicus (Nellore) cattle,"BackgroundNellore cattle play an important role in beef production in tropical systems and there is great interest in determining if genomic selection can contribute to accelerate genetic improvement of production and fertility in this breed. We present the first results of the implementation of genomic prediction in a Bos indicus (Nellore) population.MethodsInfluential bulls were genotyped with the Illumina Bovine HD chip in order to assess genomic predictive ability for weight and carcass traits, gestation length, scrotal circumference and two selection indices. 685 samples and 320 238 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used in the analyses. A forward-prediction scheme was adopted to predict the genomic breeding values (DGV). In the training step, the estimated breeding values (EBV) of bulls were deregressed (dEBV) and used as pseudo-phenotypes to estimate marker effects using four methods: genomic BLUP with or without a residual polygenic effect (GBLUP20 and GBLUP0, respectively), a mixture model (Bayes C) and Bayesian LASSO (BLASSO). Empirical accuracies of the resulting genomic predictions were assessed based on the correlation between DGV and dEBV for the testing group.ResultsAccuracies of genomic predictions ranged from 0.17 (navel at weaning) to 0.74 (finishing precocity). Across traits, Bayesian regression models (Bayes C and BLASSO) were more accurate than GBLUP. The average empirical accuracies were 0.39 (GBLUP0), 0.40 (GBLUP20) and 0.44 (Bayes C and BLASSO). Bayes C and BLASSO tended to produce deflated predictions (i.e. slope of the regression of dEBV on DGV greater than 1). Further analyses suggested that higher-than-expected accuracies were observed for traits for which EBV means differed significantly between two breeding subgroups that were identified in a principal component analysis based on genomic relationships.ConclusionsBayesian regression models are of interest for future applications of genomic selection in this population, but further improvements are needed to reduce deflation of their predictions. Recurrent updates of the training population would be required to enable accurate prediction of the genetic merit of young animals. The technical feasibility of applying genomic prediction in a Bos indicus (Nellore) population was demonstrated. Further research is needed to permit cost-effective selection decisions using genomic information.",2013,"Genetics, Selection, Evolution : GSE"
