Artificial intelligence models to stratify cardiovascular risk in incident hemodialysis patients,"End stage renal disease condition increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. The mortality rates among hemodialysis patients are 20% higher than the general population, thus in recent years the preservation of the cardiovascular system has become a major point of focus for nephrology care in patients. Cardiovascular events jeopardize the life of a dialysis patient and must therefore be prevented. The aim of this study is to develop forecast models that can predict the cardiovascular outcome of incident hemodialysis (HD) patients. Data relating to the treatment methods and the physiological condition of patients was collected during the first 18months of renal replacement therapy and then used to predict the insurgence of cardiovascular events within a 6-month time window. Information regarding 4246 incident hemodialysis patients was collected. A Lasso logistic regression model and a random forest model were developed and used for predictive comparison. Every forecast model was tested on 20% of the data and a 5-fold cross validation approach was used to validate the random forest model. Random forest showed higher performance with AUC of the ROC curve and sensitivity higher than 70% in both the temporal windows models, proving that random forests are able to exploit non-linear patterns retrieved in the feature space. Out of bag estimates of variable importance and regression coefficients were used to gain insight into the models implemented. We found out that malnutrition and an inflammatory condition strongly influence cardiovascular outcome in incident HD patients. Indeed the most important variables in the model were blood test variables such as the total protein content, percentage value of albumin, total protein content, creatinine and C reactive protein. Age of patients and weight loss in the first six months of renal replacement therapy were also highly involved in the prediction. A greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in the insurgence of cardiovascular events in dialysis patients can ensure physicians to intervene in the appropriate manner when a high-risk cardiovascular condition is identified.",2013,Expert Syst.

A signature of 33 immuneâ€related gene pairs predicts clinical outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma,"OBJECTIVE
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become the second most common tumor type that contributes to cancer-related death worldwide. The study aimed to establishÂ a robust immune-related gene pair (IRGP) signature for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients.


METHODS
Two RNA-seq datasets (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program and International Cancer Genome Consortium) and one microarray dataset (GSE14520) were included in this study. We used a series of immune-related genes from the ImmPort database to construct gene pairs. Lasso penalized Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to develop the best prognostic signature. We assigned patients into two groups with low immune risk and high immune risk. Then, the prognostic ability of the signature was evaluated by a log-rank test and a Cox proportional hazards regression model.


RESULTS
After 1000 iterations, the 33-immune gene pair model obtained the highest frequency. As a result, we chose the 33 immune gene pairs to establish the immune-related prognostic signature. As we expected, the immune-related signature accurately predicted the prognosis of HCC patients, and high-risk groups showed poor prognosis in the training datasets and testing datasets as well as in the validation datasets. Furthermore, the immune-related gene pair (IRGP) signature also showed higher predictive accuracy than three existing prognostic signatures.


CONCLUSION
Our prognostic signature, which reflects the link between the immune microenvironment and HCC patient outcome, is promising for prognosis prediction in HCC.",2020,Cancer Medicine
A novel prognostic nomogram based on 5 long non-coding RNAs in clear cell renal cell carcinoma,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common and invasive histological subtype of all kidney malignancies, with high levels of incidence and mortality. In the present study, long non-coding (lnc)RNA expression profiles of patients with ccRCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were comprehensively analyzed to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs). The patients with ccRCC were then divided into training and validation cohorts. Univariate and LASSO regression analyses were performed to select the most significant survival-associated candidate DElncRNAs in the training cohort. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was then performed to develop a risk score formula and a prognostic nomogram for predicting 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS). The accuracies of the nomogram predictions were evaluated by determining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and a calibration plot. Finally, functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction network prediction were implemented to predict the functions and molecular mechanisms of the candidate DElncRNAs in ccRCC. A total of 1,553 DElncRNAs were identified, and 5 candidate DElncRNAs (AC026992.2, AC245041.2, LINC00524, LINC01956 and LINC02080) were included in the nomogram. The AUC values for 3- and 5-year overall survival in the training cohort were 0.768 and 0.814, respectively, which were increased compared with that based on the clinical index (0.760 and 0.694, respectively). Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that the 521 mRNAs highly associated with 5 DElncRNAs were primarily involved in 17 terms and 25 pathways, respectively. Based on the 5 DElncRNAs, a novel and convenient prognostic nomogram for predicting 3- and 5-year OS for patients with ccRCC was developed. The results of the present study may be conducive to the development of a precise predictive tool for the prognosis of ccRCC and may provide information regarding the molecular mechanisms of ccRCC. However, additional experimental in vitro and in vivo studies investigating lncRNAs may be required.",2019,Oncology Letters
Pixel prediction by context based regression,"We propose a pixel prediction algorithm, which learns a regression function corresponding to each context. A context refers to a group of pixels, that have similar correlations with its neighboring pixels. We propose to form a pixel's feature vector by its neighboring pixels' ratios, so that they better capture the pixel properties described by the regression weights. Then we use K-means clustering to classify the feature vectors of all pixels into several contexts. Clustering reduces pixel randomness within each context, thus reducing prediction error. We apply three regression algorithms, the least square, quantile and lasso regression, which assume different loss function and regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that all context based regression methods have outperformed conventional pixel predictors. Among them, quantile regression, which assumes l1-norm loss function has the best result. It has 3.1% less bits per pixel (bpp) than least square prediction with 12 neighboring pixels.",2012,"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Nomogram to predict postoperative PR in patients undergoing CT-guided transthoracic lung biopsy.,"Background
Pleural reaction (PR) frequently occurs following computed tomography-guided transthoracic needle biopsy (CT-TNB). The purpose of this study was to establish a predictive model for PR following CT-TNB.


Methods
In this study, a total of 436 patients who underwent CT-TNB between June 2016 and December 2017 at a tertiary hospital were consecutively included. Patient demographics, lesion features, laboratory tests, and biopsy parameters were collected. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to establish a prediction model for post-CT-TNB PR, presented by a nomogram. Discrimination and calibration were assessed. For internal validation, a bootstrap resampling method was applied, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate its clinical utility.


Results
PR occurred in 7.8% (34/436) of patients. Four non-zero coefficient variables (gender, age, lesion location, and puncture position) were filtered by LASSO regression analysis and were used to establish a predictive model. The area under the curve in the derivation and validation was 0.840 (95% CI, 0.767-0.913) and 0.841 (95% CI, 0.769-0.912), respectively. The model was well-calibrated (P>0.05), and DCA indicated clinical efficacy.


Conclusions
In this study, we established a nomogram, including as parameters gender, age, lesion location, and puncture position, which may have great significance for individualized prediction of post-CT-TNB PR.",2019,Journal of thoracic disease
Marine regressions and the evolution of groundwater dwelling amphipods (Crustacea),"The origin of marine lineages of amphipods in continental and insular ground waters is treated, and the im- portance in it of relative sea-level lowering is weighed. Pat- terns of distribution and relationships of Hadzioidea, Salentinellidae, Bogidielloidea and Niphargidae are re- viewed, with emphasis on the evidence for their direct marine origin, and on their dispersal abilities. The process of troglobitization, linked with subterranean evolution, in amphipods is discussed. A two-step model of the evolution of thalassoid lineages is discerned. During the first phase, marine populations colonize crevicular or interstitial habitats. These habitats are physiographically connected with the inland stygohabi- tats, and are characterized by severe ecological conditions. During the second phase, certain lineages overcome the salinity boundary and colonize inland ground waters through active migration or passive isolation, or through a combination of both. Marine regressions seem of little significance in the first evolutionary phase, where they primarily explain the isola- tion in coastal ground waters of marine littoral populations, already adapted to subterranean conditions. Vicariance by marine regressions is considered of relatively great evolu- tionary significance in thalassoid groups of low vagility and dispersal ability. This type of vicariance is followed by peripatric speciation, and a largely polychotomous pattern of descent is predicted.",1991,Journal of Biogeography
A clinical predictive score for postoperative myasthenic crisis,"OBJECTIVE
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease mostly caused by autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptor associated with thymus abnormalities. Thymectomy has been proven to be an efficacious treatment for patients with MG, but postoperative myasthenic crisis often occurs and is a major complication. We aimed to develop and validate a simple scoring system based on clinical characteristics in the preoperative status to predict the risk of postoperative myasthenic crisis.


METHODS
We studied 393 patients with MG who underwent thymectomy at 6 tertiary centers in Japan (275 patients for derivation and 118 for validation). Clinical characteristics, such as gender, age at onset and operation, body mass index, disease duration, MG subtype, severity, symptoms, preoperative therapy, operative data, and laboratory data, were reviewed retrospectively. A multivariate logistic regression with LASSO penalties was used to determine the factors associated with postoperative myasthenic crisis, and a score was assigned. Finally, the predictive score was evaluated using bootstrapping technique in the derivation and validation groups.


RESULTS
Multivariate logistic regression identified 3 clinical factors for predicting postoperative myasthenic crisis risk: (1) vital capacityâ€‰<â€‰80%, (2) disease durationâ€‰<â€‰3 months, and (3) bulbar symptoms immediately before thymectomy. The postoperative myasthenic crisis predictive score, ranging from 0 to 6 points, had areas under the curve of 0.84 (0.66-0.96) in the derivation group and 0.80 (0.62-0.95) in the validation group.


INTERPRETATION
A simple scoring system based on 3 preoperative clinical characteristics can predict the possibility of postoperative myasthenic crisis. Ann Neurol 2017;82:841-849.",2017,Annals of Neurology
Three differentially expressed miRNAs as potential biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma prognosis.,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study is to screen MicroRNA (miRNA) related to the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and to explore the possible molecular mechanism.


METHODS
A total of 535 LUAD data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The miRNAs for LUAD prognosis were screened by Cox risk proportional regression model and Last Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model. The performance of the model was verified by time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The possible biological process of miRNAs' target genes was analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto gene and genome encyclopedia (KEGG).


RESULTS
127 differentially expressed miRNAs were screened with 111 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated miRNAs. Three key miRNAs, hsa-miR-1293, hsa-miR-490 and hsa-miR-5571, were screened from survival analysis, which are significantly enriched in systemic lupus erythematosus pathways.


CONCLUSION
Hsa-miR-1293, hsa-miR-490 and hsa-miR-5571 can be used as novel biomarkers for the prediction of prognosis of LUAD.",2020,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening
Efficiency for Regularization Parameter Selection in Penalized Likelihood Estimation of Misspecified Models,"It has been shown that Akaike information criterion (AIC)-type criteria are asymptotically efficient selectors of the tuning parameter in nonconcave penalized regression methods under the assumption that the population variance is known or that a consistent estimator is available. We relax this assumption to prove that AIC itself is asymptotically efficient and we study its performance in finite samples. In classical regression, it is known that AIC tends to select overly complex models when the dimension of the maximum candidate model is large relative to the sample size. Simulation studies suggest that AIC suffers from the same shortcomings when used in penalized regression. We therefore propose the use of the classical corrected AIC (AIC c ) as an alternative and prove that it maintains the desired asymptotic properties. To broaden our results, we further prove the efficiency of AIC for penalized likelihood methods in the context of generalized linear models with no dispersion parameter. Similar results exist in the literature but only for a restricted set of candidate models. By employing results from the classical literature on maximum-likelihood estimation in misspecified models, we are able to establish this result for a general set of candidate models. We use simulations to assess the performance of AIC and AIC c , as well as that of other selectors, in finite samples for both smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD)-penalized and Lasso regressions and a real data example is considered. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",2013,Journal of the American Statistical Association
The group lasso for logistic regression,"The group lasso is an extension of the lasso to do variable selection on (predefined) groups of variables in linear regression models. The estimates have the attractive property of being invariant under groupwise orthogonal reparameterizations. We extend the group lasso to logistic regression models and present an efficient algorithm, that is especially suitable for high dimensional problems, which can also be applied to generalized linear models to solve the corresponding convex optimization problem. The group lasso estimator for logistic regression is shown to be statistically consistent even if the number of predictors is much larger than sample size but with sparse true underlying structure. We further use a two-stage procedure which aims for sparser models than the group lasso, leading to improved prediction performance for some cases. Moreover, owing to the two-stage nature, the estimates can be constructed to be hierarchical. The methods are used on simulated and real data sets about splice site detection in DNA sequences.

Color Correction Method for Digital Camera Based on Variable-Exponent Polynomial Regression,"Subject to the response uniformity of photoelectric sensors, the captured raw images always have serious chroma distortions. How to determine the mapping matrix between RGB and XYZ color spaces is important for the color distortion correction. However, the commonly used algorithms cannot give consideration to the precision and the adaptability. A more reasonable mapping algorithm based on variable-exponent polynomial regression is proposed to evaluate the mapping matrix coefficients. Variable-exponent regularization with the LÏ-norm (1 < Ï < 2) combines the features of lasso regression and ridge regression methods, owning both the sparsity and smoothing properties. The optimal solution for the variable-exponent regularization is given using lagged fix-point iteration method. Data from the standard color correction experiments are used to test the variable-exponent, lasso, ridge, and least-squares regression algorithms with different polynomial regression models. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has the best performance.",2018,
A Fixed-point Proximity Approach to Solving the Support Vector Regression with the Group Lasso Regularization,"We introduce an optimization model of the support vector regression with the group lasso regularization and develop a class of efficient two-step fixed-point proximity algorithms to solve it numerically. To overcome the difficulty brought by the non-differentiability of the group lasso regularization term and the loss function in the proposed model, we characterize its solutions as fixed-points of a nonlinear map defined in terms of the proximity operators of the functions appearing in the objective function of the model. We then propose a class of two-step fixedpoint algorithms to solve numerically the optimization problem based on the fixed-point equation. We establish convergence results of the proposed algorithms. Numerical experiments with both synthetic data and real-world benchmark data are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model and algorithms.",2017,
Evaluating the Risk Factors of Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation Complications with Nd-YAG Laser Toning Using LASSO-Based Algorithm,"The neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd-YAG) laser is used for removal of pigmented skin patches and rejuvenation of skin. However, complications such as hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, and petechiae can occur after frequent treatments. Therefore, identifying the risk factors for such complications is important. The development of a multivariable logistic regression model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is needed to provide valid predictions about the incidence of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation complication probability (PIHCP) among patients treated with Nd-YAG laser toning. A total of 125 female patients undergoing laser toning therapy between January 2014 and January 2016 were examined for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) complications. Factor analysis was performed using 15 potential predictive risk factors of PIH determined by a physician. The LASSO algorithm with cross-validation was used to select the optimal number of predictive risk factors from the potential factors for a multivariate logistic regression PIH complication model. The optimal number of predictive risk factors for the model was five: immediate endpoints of laser (IEL), Î±-hydroxy acid (AHA) peels, Fitzpatrick skin phototype (FSPT), acne, and melasma. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.70â€“0.88) in the optimal model. The overall performance of the LASSO-based PIHCP model was satisfactory based on the AUC, Omnibus, Nagelkerke R2, and Hosmerâ€“Lemeshow tests. This predictive risk factor model is useful to further optimize laser toning treatment related to PIH. The LASSO-based PIHCP model could be useful for decision-making.",2020,Applied Sciences
[Prediction of 6-year incidence risk of chronic kidney disease in the elderly aged 65 years and older in 8 longevity areas in China].,"Objective: To establish a prediction model for 6-year incidence risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the elderly aged 65 years and older in China. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we used the data of 3 742 participants collected during 2008/2009-2014 and during 2012-2017/2018 from Healthy Aging and Biomarkers Cohort Study, a sub-cohort of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Two follow up surveys for renal function were successfully conducted for 1 055 participants without CKD in baseline survey. Lasso method was used for the selection of risk factors. The risk prediction model of CKD was established by using Cox proportional hazards regression models and visualized through nomogram tool. Bootstrap method (1 000 resample) was used for internal validation, and the performance of the model was assessed by C-index and calibration curve. Results: The mean age of participants was (80.8Â±11.4) years. In 4 797 person years of follow up, CKD was found in 262 participants (24.8%). Age, BMI, sex, education level, marital status, having retirement pension or insurance, hypertension prevalence, blood uric acid, blood urea nitrogen and total cholesterol levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate in baseline survey were used in the model to predict the 6-year incidence risk of CKD in the elderly. The corrected C-index was 0.766, the calibration curve showed good consistence between predicted probability and observed probability in high risk group, but relatively poor consistence in low risk group. Conclusion: The incidence risk prediction model of CKD established in this study has a good performance, and the nomogram can be used as visualization tool to predict the 6-year risk of CKD in the elderly aged 65 years and older in China.",2020,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi
Process monitoring research based on sparse principal component analysis,"Principal Component Analysis(PCA)is a multivariate statistical technique, with a range of applications in data processing and dimensionality reduction. Over the past two decades, PCA method has also been widely applied to various kinds of industrial processes for process monitoring and fault diagnosis with some successes. Due to the increasing volumes of data, process monitoring methods which are based on PCA approaches suffer many limitations, such as great calculation loads and poor real-time performance. In this paper, a new method called Sparse Principal Component Analysis(SPCA)is developed in process monitoring, using the lasso(least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)to produce modified principal components with sparse loadings. And the SPCA can be formulated as a regression-type optimization function to achieve the main elements of choice. Furthermore, the fault detection is then performed by a detection index using model parameters, and the sparse principal component analysis is used in the Tennessee Eastman process(TE processes)monitoring for simulations. Compared with the traditional principal component analysis method, this SPCA approach builds a model based on the sparse modeling data. Therefore it can reduce the amount of calculations and improve the real time performance. As the SPCA model is applied to simulate with real data, the results show that it has better effectiveness in TE processes.",2014,Computer Engineering and Applications
Choosing Clinical Variables for Risk Stratification Post-Acute Coronary Syndrome,"Most risk stratification methods use expert opinion to identify a fixed number of clinical variables that have prognostic significance. In this study our goal was to develop improved metrics that utilize a variable number of input parameters. We first used Bootstrap Lasso Regression (BLR) â€“ a Machine Learning method for selecting important variables â€“ to identify a prognostic set of features that identify patients at high risk of death 6-months after presenting with an Acute Coronary Syndrome. Using data derived from the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) we trained a logistic regression model using these features and evaluated its performance on a development set (Nâ€‰=â€‰43,063) containing patients who have values for all features, and a separate dataset (Nâ€‰=â€‰6,363) that contains patients who have missing feature values. The final model, Ridge Logistic Regression with Variable Inputs (RLRVI), uses imputation to estimate values for missing features. BLR identified 19 features, 8 of which appear in the GRACE score. RLRVI had modest, yet statistically significant, improvement over the standard GRACE score on both datasets. Moreover, for patients who are relatively low-risk (GRACEâ‰¤87), RLRVI had an AUC and Hazard Ratio of 0.754 and 6.27, respectively, vs. 0.688 and 2.46 for GRACE, (pâ€‰<â€‰0.007). RLRVI has improved discriminatory performance on patients who have values for the 8 GRACE features plus any subset of the 11 non-GRACE features. Our results demonstrate that BLR and data imputation can be used to obtain improved risk stratification metrics, particularly for patients who are classified as low risk using traditional methods.",2019,Scientific Reports
Deciphering N6-Methyladenosine-Related Genes Signature to Predict Survival in Lung Adenocarcinoma,"Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death. Among these, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) accounts for most cases. Due to the improvement of precision medicine based on molecular characterization, the treatment of LUAD underwent significant changes. With these changes, the prognosis of LUAD becomes diverse. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most predominant modification in mRNAs, which has been a research hotspot in the field of oncology. Nevertheless, little has been studied to reveal the correlations between the m6A-related genes and prognosis in LUAD. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of m6A-related gene expressions in LUAD patients based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database by revealing their relationship with prognosis. Different expressions of the m6A-related genes in tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues were confirmed. Furthermore, their relationship with prognosis was studied via Consensus Clustering Analysis, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Regression. Based on the above analyses, a m6A-based signature to predict the overall survival (OS) in LUAD was successfully established. Among the 479 cases, we found that most of the m6A-related genes were differentially expressed between tumor and non-tumor tissues. Six genes, HNRNPC, METTL3, YTHDC2, KIAA1429, ALKBH5, and YTHDF1 were screened to build a risk scoring signature, which is strongly related to the clinical features pathological stages (p < 0.05), M stages (p < 0.05), T stages (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), gender (p = 0.04), and survival outcome (p = 0.02). Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that risk value could be used as an independent prognostic factor, revealing that the m6A-related genes signature has great predictive value. Its efficacy was also validated by data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.",2020,BioMed Research International
Simultaneous support recovery in high dimensions : Benefits and perils of block l 1 / l âˆž-regularization,"Given a collection of r â‰¥ 2 linear regression problems in p dimensions, suppose that the regression coefficients share partially common supports of size at most s. This set-up suggests the use of l1/lâˆž-regularized regression for joint estimation of the p Ã— r matrix of regression coefficients. We analyze the high-dimensional scaling ofl1/lâˆž-regularized quadratic programming, considering both consistency rates in lâˆž-norm, and how the minimal sample size n required for consistent variable selection scales with model dimension, sparsity, and overlap between the supports. We first establish bounds on thelâˆž-error as well sufficient conditions for exact variable selection for fixed design matrices, as well as for designs drawn randomly from general Gaussian distributions. Specializing to the caser = 2 linear regression problems with standard Gaussian designs whose supports overlap in a fraction Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] of their entries, we prove that l1/lâˆž-regularized method undergoes a phase transition characterized by the rescaled sample size Î¸1,âˆž(n, p, s, Î±) = n/{(4 âˆ’ 3Î±)s log(p âˆ’ (2 âˆ’ Î±) s)}. An implication is that the use ofl1/lâˆž-regularization yields improved statistical efficiency if the overlap parameter is large enough ( Î± > 2/3), but has worse statistical efficiency than a naive Lasso-based approach for moderate to small overlap (Î± < 2/3). Empirical simulations illustrate the close agreement between theory and actual behavior in practice. These results show that caution must be exercised in applyingl1/lâˆž block regularization: if the data does not match its structure very closely, it can impair statistical performance relative to computationally less expensive schemes.",2009,
A Communication-Efficient Parallel Method for Group-Lasso,"Group-Lasso (gLasso) identifies important explanatory factors in predicting the response variable by considering the grouping structure over input variables. However, most existing algorithms for gLasso are not scalable to deal with large-scale datasets, which are becoming a norm in many applications. In this paper, we present a divide-and-conquer based parallel algorithm (DC-gLasso) to scale up gLasso in the tasks of regression with grouping structures. DC-gLasso only needs two iterations to collect and aggregate the local estimates on subsets of the data, and is provably correct to recover the true model under certain conditions. We further extend it to deal with overlappings between groups. Empirical results on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets show that DC-gLasso can significantly improve the time efficiency without sacrificing regression accuracy.",2016,ArXiv
A Unified Variable Selection Approach for Varying Coefficient Models,"In varying coefficient models, three types of variable selection problems are of practical interests: separation of varying and constant effects, selection of variables with nonzero varying effects, and selection of variables with nonzero con- stant effects. Existing variable selection methods in the literature often focus on only one of the three types. In this paper, we develop a unified variable selection approach for both least squares regression and quantile regression models with pos- sibly varying coefficients. The developed method is carried out by using a two-step iterative procedure based on basis expansion and a double adaptive-LASSO-type penalty. Under some regularity conditions, we show that the proposed procedure is consistent in both variable selection and the separation of varying and constant coefficients. In addition, the estimated varying coefficients possess the optimal con- vergence rate under the same smoothness assumption, and the estimated constant coefficients have the same asymptotic distribution as their counterparts obtained when the true model is known. Finally, we investigate the finite sample perfor- mance of the proposed method through a simulation study and the analysis of the Childhood Malnutrition Data in India.",2012,Statistica Sinica
Heterogeneous structural breaks in panel data models,"This paper develops a new model and a new estimation procedure for panel data that allow us to identify heterogeneous structural breaks. In many applications, there are good reasons to suspect that structural breaks occur at different time points across individual units and the sizes of the breaks differ too. We model individual heterogeneity using a grouped pattern such that individuals within a given group share the same regression coefficients. For each group, we allow common structural breaks in the coefficients, while the number of breaks, the break points, and the size of breaks can differ across groups. To estimate the model, we develop a hybrid procedure of the grouped fixed effects approach and adaptive group fused Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). We show that our method can consistently identify the latent group structure, detect structural breaks, and estimate the regression parameters. Monte Carlo results demonstrate a good performance of the proposed method in finite samples. We apply our method to two cross-country empirical studies and illustrate the importance of taking heterogeneous structural breaks into account.",2018,arXiv: Econometrics

Development and Validation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Adverse Events Following Surgery for Lumbar Degenerative Spondylolisthesis.,"INTRODUCTION
Preoperative prognostication of adverse events (AEs) for patients undergoing surgery for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (LDS) can improve risk stratification and help guide the surgical decision-making process. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a set of predictive variables for 30-day AEs following surgery for LDS.


METHODS
The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) was used for this study (2005-2016). Logistic regression (enter, stepwise and forward) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods were performed to identify and select variables for analyses, which resulted in 26 potential models. The final model was selected based upon clinical criteria and numerical results.


RESULTS
The overall 30-day rate of AEs for 80,610 patients who underwent surgery for LDS in this database was 4.9% (n=3,965). The median age of the cohort was 58.0 years (range, 18-89 years). The model with the following 10-predictive factors: age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, autogenous iliac bone graft, instrumented fusion, levels of surgery, surgical approach, functional status, preoperative serum albumin (g/dl) and serum alkaline phosphatase (IU/L) performed well on the discrimination, calibration, Brier score and decision analyses to develop machine learning algorithms. Logistic regression showed higher AUCs than LASSO methods across the different models. The predictive probability derived from the best model is uploaded on an open access web application which can be found at: https://spine.massgeneral.org/drupal/Lumbar-Degenerative-AdverseEvents CONCLUSION: It is feasible to develop machine learning algorithms from large datasets to provide useful tools for patient-counseling and surgical risk assessment.",2020,World neurosurgery
Performance of a blockwise approach in variable selection using linkage disequilibrium information,"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim at finding genetic markers that are significantly associated with a phenotype of interest. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from the entire genome are collected for many thousands of SNP markers, leading to high-dimensional regression problems where the number of predictors greatly exceeds the number of observations. Moreover, these predictors are statistically dependent, in particular due to linkage disequilibrium (LD).We propose a three-step approach that explicitly takes advantage of the grouping structure induced by LD in order to identify common variants which may have been missed by single marker analyses (SMA). In the first step, we perform a hierarchical clustering of SNPs with an adjacency constraint using LD as a similarity measure. In the second step, we apply a model selection approach to the obtained hierarchy in order to define LD blocks. Finally, we perform Group Lasso regression on the inferred LD blocks. We investigate the efficiency of this approach compared to state-of-the art regression methods: haplotype association tests, SMA, and Lasso and Elastic-Net regressions.ResultsOur results on simulated data show that the proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art approaches as soon as the number of causal SNPs within an LD block exceeds 2. Our results on semi-simulated data and a previously published HIV data set illustrate the relevance of the proposed method and its robustness to a real LD structure. The method is implemented in the R package BALD (Blockwise Approach using Linkage Disequilibrium), available from http://www.math-evry.cnrs.fr/publications/logiciels.ConclusionsOur results show that the proposed method is efficient not only at the level of LD blocks by inferring well the underlying block structure but also at the level of individual SNPs. Thus, this study demonstrates the importance of tailored integration of biological knowledge in high-dimensional genomic studies such as GWAS.",2015,BMC Bioinformatics
The Potential of Radiomics Nomogram in Non-invasively Prediction of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation Status and Subtypes in Lung Adenocarcinoma,"Purpose: Up to 50% of Asian patients with NSCLC have EGFR gene mutations, indicating that selecting eligible patients for EGFR-TKIs treatments is clinically important. The aim of the study is to develop and validate radiomics-based nomograms, integrating radiomics, CT features and clinical characteristics, to non-invasively predict EGFR mutation status and subtypes. Materials and Methods: We included 637 patients with lung adenocarcinomas, who performed the EGFR mutations analysis in the current study. The whole dataset was randomly split into a training dataset (n = 322) and validation dataset (n = 315). A sub-dataset of EGFR-mutant lesions (EGFR mutation in exon 19 and in exon 21) was used to explore the capability of radiomic features for predicting EGFR mutation subtypes. Four hundred seventy-five radiomic features were extracted and a radiomics sore (R-score) was constructed by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression in the training dataset. A radiomics-based nomogram, incorporating clinical characteristics, CT features and R-score was developed in the training dataset and evaluated in the validation dataset. Results: The constructed R-scores achieved promising performance on predicting EGFR mutation status and subtypes, with AUCs of 0.694 and 0.708 in two validation datasets, respectively. Moreover, the constructed radiomics-based nomograms excelled the R-scores, clinical, CT features alone in terms of predicting EGFR mutation status and subtypes, with AUCs of 0.734 and 0.757 in two validation datasets, respectively. Conclusions: Radiomics-based nomogram, incorporating clinical characteristics, CT features and radiomic features, can non-invasively and efficiently predict the EGFR mutation status and thus potentially fulfill the ultimate purpose of precision medicine. The methodology is a possible promising strategy to predict EGFR mutation subtypes, providing the support of clinical treatment scenario.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Correction model for the temperature of numerical weather prediction by SVM,"In order to improve the accuracy of numerical weather prediction(NWP) temperature, a support vector machine (SVM) model based on LASSO feature analysis is proposed to revise the predicted temperature for the next 12 hours. In this paper, high-resolution mode prediction data that include 2m temperature and related meteorological factors forecasted by the European Center of Medium range Weather Forecast ( ECMWF) , and the temperature data of the automatic stations in East China and coastal areas provided by the Shanghai Meteorological Bureau are used to build the proposed model. , In this paper, The results show that the root mean square error, absolute error and accuracy are greatly improved by the proposed prediction model. The comprehensive performance of the proposed method is better than that of the traditional linear regression technology.",2020,
"Hepatocellular carcinoma associated microRNA expression signature: integrated bioinformatics analysis, experimental validation and clinical significance","microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles varied greatly among current studies due to different technological platforms and small sample size. Systematic and integrative analysis of published datesets that compared the miRNA expression profiles between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and paired adjacent noncancerous liver tissue was performed to determine candidate HCC associated miRNAs. Moreover, we further validated the confirmed miRNAs in a clinical setting using qRT-PCR and Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. A miRNA integrated-signature of 5 upregulated and 8 downregulated miRNAs was identified from 26 published datesets in HCC using robust rank aggregation method. qRT-PCR demonstrated that miR-93-5p, miR-224-5p, miR-221-3p and miR-21-5p was increased, whereas the expression of miR-214-3p, miR-199a-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-150-5p and miR-145-5p was decreased in the HCC tissues, which was also validated on TCGA dataset. A miRNA based score using LASSO regression model provided a high accuracy for identifying HCC tissue (AUC = 0.982): HCC risk score = 0.180E_miR-221 + 0.0262E_miR-21 - 0.007E_miR-223 - 0.185E_miR-130a. E_miR-n = Log 2 (expression of microRNA n). Furthermore, expression of 5 miRNAs (miR-222, miR-221, miR-21 miR-214 and miR-130a) correlated with pathological tumor grade. Cox regression analysis showed that miR-21 was related with 3-year survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.509, 95%CI: 1.079-2.112, P = 0.016) and 5-year survival (HR: 1.416, 95%CI: 1.057-1.897, P = 0.020). However, none of the deregulated miRNAs was related with microscopic vascular invasion. This study provides a basis for further clinical application of miRNAs in HCC.",2015,Oncotarget
