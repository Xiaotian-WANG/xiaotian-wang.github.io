Genetic biomarkers associated with changes in quality of life and pain following palliative radiotherapy in patients with bone metastases.,"BACKGROUND
Patients with bone metastases undergoing palliative radiation therapy (RT) may experience changes in both the functional and symptomatic aspects of quality of life (QOL). The European Organization of Cancer Research and Treatment (EORTC) QOL Questionnaire Core-15 Palliative (QLQ-C15-PAL) is a validated questionnaire employed to assess QOL specifically in palliative patients. Our study aimed to identify single-nucleotide variant (SNV) genetic biomarkers associated with changes in QOL and pain.


METHODS
Fifty-two patients who received a single 8-Gy RT for painful bone metastases completed the EORTC QOL-C15-PAL questionnaire prior to randomization and at 42-day post RT. Saliva samples obtained at day of RT were sequenced, and SNVs from genes involved in inflammation, radiation response, immune response, DNA damage, or QOL were assessed for association with changes in global QOL or the pain scale items using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. The penalized LASSO method with minimum Bayesian information criterion was used to select a multi-SNV model out of significant SNVs (P<0.005) and to produce prognostic scores for patients that categorized them into risk groups of low, middle, and high.


RESULTS
The multivariable model predicting global QOL included 14 SNVs, of which HS1BP3 rs35579164 G:C and ABCA1 rs2230805 C>T had the largest positive and negative effect sizes, respectively (HS1BP3: 8.21, ABCA1: -3.44). The model for the response of QOL pain item included 8 SNVs, of which PLAUR rs4760 A>G and ELAC2rs11545302 had the largest positive and negative effect sizes, respectively (PLAUR: 5.23; ELAC: -3.84). The patients' risk groups were highly predictive of QOL response (P<0.0001) and pain item response (P<0.0001). In logistic regression analysis accounting for baseline factors of gender and primary cancer site, the global QOL risk group predicts pain response after RT [OR: 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-3.9, P=0.015], but the QOL pain item risk group did not (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.5-1.6, P=0.79). The multi-SNVs model included SNVs from genes involved in metabolism, membrane transport, cell cycle control, ciliary structure, and gene expression regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
SNVs were significantly associated with changes in global QOL of global domain and pain item in patients with bone metastases. Identification of genetic biomarkers predictive of QOL items may allow patients and health care providers anticipate and better address the needs of the palliative cancer patient population.",2017,Annals of palliative medicine
Output Feature Augmented Lasso,"Lasso simultaneously conducts variable selection and supervised regression. In this paper, we extend Lasso to multiple output prediction, which belongs to the categories of structured learning. Though structured learning makes use of both input and output simultaneously, the joint feature mapping in current framework of structured learning is usually application-specific. As a result, ad hoc heuristics have to be employed to design different joint feature mapping functions for different applications, which results in the lackness of generalization ability for multiple output prediction. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose to augment Lasso with output by decoupling the joint feature mapping function of traditional structured learning. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: 1) The augmented Lasso conducts regression and variable selection on both the input and output features, and thus the learned model could fit an output with both the selected input variables and the other correlated outputs. 2) To be more general, we set up nonlinear dependencies among output variables by generalized Lasso. 3) Moreover, the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) with Alternating Direction Minimizing (ADM) strategy is used to find the optimal model parameters. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2014,2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining
An Immune-Related Signature Predicts Survival in Patients With Lung Adenocarcinoma,"We investigated the local immune status and its prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma. In total, 513 lung adenocarcinoma samples from TCGA and ImmPort databases were collected and analyzed. The R package coxph was employed to mine immune-related genes that were significant prognostic indicators using both univariate and multivariate analyses. The R software package glmnet was then used for Lasso Cox regression analysis, and a prognosis prediction model was constructed for lung adenocarcinoma; clusterProfiler was selected for functional gene annotations and KEGG enrichment analysis. Finally, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features or signaling pathways were established. Sixty-four immune-related genes remarkably correlated with patient prognosis and were further applied. Samples were hierarchically clustered into two subgroups. Accordingly, the LASSO regression algorithm was employed to screen the 14 most representative immune-related genes (PSMD11, PPIA, MIF, BMP5, DKK1, PDGFB, ANGPTL4, IL1R2, THRB, LTBR, TNFRSF1, TNFRSF17, IL20RB, and MC1R) with respect to patient prognosis. Then, the prognosis prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma patients (namely, the RiskScore equation) was constructed, and the training set samples were incorporated to evaluate the efficiency of this model to predict and classify patient prognosis. Subsequently, based on functional annotations and KEGG pathway analysis, the 14 immune-related genes were mainly enriched in pathways closely associated with lung adenocarcinoma and its immune microenvironment, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection. Furthermore, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features of the training set samples and signaling pathways (such as p53, cell cycle, and DNA repair) were also demonstrated. Finally, the test set sample data were employed for independent testing and verifying the model. We established a prognostic prediction RiskScore model based on the expression profiles of 14 immune-related genes, which shows high prediction accuracy and stability in identifying immune features. This could provide clinical guidance for the diagnosis and prognosis of different immunophenotypes, and suggest multiple targets for precise advanced lung adenocarcinoma therapy based on subtype-specific immune molecules.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Integration of multiple key molecules in lung adenocarcinoma identifies prognostic and immunotherapeutic relevant gene signatures.,"BACKGROUND
Although multiple key molecules in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) have been identified in recent years, the overall tumor microenvironment (TME) immune cell infiltration characterizations mediated by multiple key molecules remain little known. This study aimed to integrate the roles of multiple key molecules to evaluate patient prognosis and TME cell infiltration characterization as well as responses to immunotherapy.


METHODS
Using combined LUAD cancer cohorts with 228 normal samples and 913 tumor samples, we comprehensively dissected the differences of genomic and TME cell infiltration landscapes between normal lung tissues and tumor tissues. The single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used to quantify the relative abundance of 24 cell infiltration. The riskScore signature was constructed using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression mode.


RESULTS
Seven novel key molecules with significantly up-regulated expression in LUAD were determined. Survival analyses revealed their important prognostic values. LUAD microenvironment presented a markedly decreased infiltration of immune cells compared to normal lung tissues. We found tumors with up-regulated expression of these key molecules exhibited a significantly decreased TME cell infiltration and increased immune checkpoint molecule expression. The high riskScore subtype was characterized by decreased innate and adaptive immune cell infiltration. Activation of p53 signaling pathway and regulator T cells were observed in the high riskScore subtype, which were regarded as T-cell suppressive and could be responsible for poorer prognosis in this subtype (HR 1.83(1.27-2.63)). Multivariate analyses demonstrated the riskScore was a robust and independent prognostic biomarker, and its value in predicting immunotherapeutic outcomes was also confirmed (HR 1.70(1.22-2.37)).


CONCLUSIONS
This study reveal a novel gene signature significantly related to patient prognosis and TME cell infiltration in LUAD. We demonstrated the integrated roles of multiple key molecules played a crucial role in shaping TME cell infiltration diversity and complexity. Evaluating the integrated characterization of multiple key molecules could contribute to predicting patients' response to immunotherapy and guiding more effective immunotherapy strategies.",2020,International immunopharmacology
DSRIG: Incorporating graphical structure in the regularized modeling of SNP data,"Genetic selection of farm animals plays an important role in genetic improvement programs. Regularized regression methods on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a set of candidate genes can help to identify genes that are associated with the trait of interest. This complex task must also consider the relative effect sizes on the desired trait and account for the relationships among the candidate SNPs so that selection of a SNP does not promote other undesirable traits through breeding. We present the Doubly Sparse Regression Incorporating Graphical structure (DSRIG), a novel regularized method for genetic selection that exploits the relationships among candidate SNPs to improve prediction. DSRIG was applied in the prediction of skatole and androstenone levels, two compounds known to be associated with boar taint. DSRIG was shown to provide a predictive benefit when compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in a cross-validation procedure. The relative sizes of the coefficient estimates over the cross-validation procedure were compared to determine which SNPs may have the greatest impact on expression of the boar taint compounds and a consensus graph was used to infer the relationships among SNPs.",2019,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology
Identification of a sixteen-microRNA signature as prognostic biomarker for stage II and III colon cancer,"Despite advances in colon cancer research and novel therapies, high risk of recurrence remains a major challenge. This study reports miRNA expression profiling as a biomarker for the prognosis of TNM stage II and III colon cancer. Fresh frozen biopsies from the study cohort (N=111) were analyzed for miRNA by RT-qPCR and LASSO regression analysis was used to build a classifier of miRNAs. The prognostic accuracy was tested and the classifier was validated in an independent colon cohort (TCGA-COAD, N=209). The LASSO regression analysis identified a 16-miRNA signature including miR-143-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-31-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-30d-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-210-3p, miR-25-3p, miR-196a-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR-222-3p, miR-30c-5p and miR-223-3p. A low 16-miRNA signature was associated with better 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) in the study cohort than a high signature (93 % versus 58 %; p< 0.001). The signature was an independent prognostic factor for better 5-year DFS in multivariate analyses (HR 21.4; 95% CI: 4.21-108.7; p< 0.001). The results in the validation cohort were consistent with the study cohort in univariate (77 % versus 65 %; p= 0.045) and multivariate analyses (HR 2.0; 95% CI: 1.04-3.89; p=0.039). We identified a 16-miRNA signature as a reliable prognostic biomarker for classification of colon cancer stage II and III patients into groups with low and high risk for recurrence.",2017,Oncotarget
ensr: R Package for Simultaneous Selection of Elastic Net Tuning Parameters,"Motivation: Elastic net regression is a form of penalized regression that lies between ridge and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The elastic net penalty is a powerful tool controlling the impact of correlated predictors and the overall complexity of generalized linear regression models. The elastic net penalty has two tuning parameters: ${\lambda}$ for the complexity and ${\alpha}$ for the compromise between LASSO and ridge. The R package glmnet provides efficient tools for fitting elastic net models and selecting ${\lambda}$ for a given ${\alpha}.$ However, glmnet does not simultaneously search the ${\lambda} - {\alpha}$ space for the optional elastic net model. 
Results: We built the R package ensr, elastic net searcher. enser extends the functionality of glment to search the ${\lambda} - {\alpha}$ space and identify an optimal ${\lambda} - {\alpha}$ pair.

The Feasibility and Efficacy of a Large-Sized Lasso Catheter Combined With 3 Dimensional Mapping System for Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
We aimed to investigate whether a large-sized Lasso catheter could increase the success rate of immediate complete pulmonary vein (PV) antral isolation and improve the outcome of catheter ablation in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.


SUBJECTS AND METHODS
This study included 107 consecutive patients (67 males, mean age: 57.8Â±9.7 years) who underwent PV mapping and ablation due to symptomatic drug-refractory AF. The first 43 patients underwent isolation of both ipsilateral PVs using the Carto-Merge 3 dimensional mapping system (group 1). The other 64 patients underwent isolation of both ipsilateral PVs using the same technique with a large-sized (a diameter of 30 to 35 mm) Lasso cathe-ter (group 2). When ipsilateral PVs did not show any potential after the initial circumferential ablation, we defined this as 'immediate complete antral isolation (ICAI)'. We compared the AF recurrence rate of both groups.


RESULTS
There was no significant difference of the clinical characteristics between group 1 and group 2. All the patients were followed-up for 1 year. The ICAI rate of group 1 and group 2 was significantly different (21% vs. 78%, p<0.001), and the AF recurrence rates of group 1 and group 2 were also different (34.9% vs. 18.8%, p=0.042). Using multiple logistic regression analysis, the use of a large-sized Lasso catheter was a significant predictive factor for preventing recurrence (odds ratio: 0.489, 95% confidence interval: 0.136-0.927).


CONCLUSION
It is likely that a large-sized Lasso catheter plays an important role in achieving ICAI and in lowering the rate of AF recurrence.",2011,Korean Circulation Journal
Methods of Machine Learning for Censored Demand Prediction,"In this paper, we analyze a new approach for demand prediction in retail. One of the significant gaps in demand prediction by machine learning methods is the unaccounted sales data censorship. Econometric approaches to modeling censored demand are used to obtain consistent and unbiased estimates of parameters. These approaches can also be transferred to different classes of machine learning models to reduce the prediction error of sales volume. In this study we build two ensemble models to predict demand with and without demand censorship, aggregating predictions for machine learning methods such as Linear regression, Ridge regression, LASSO and Random forest. Having estimated the predictive properties of both models, we test the best predictive power of the models with accounting for the censored nature of demand.",2018,
A Correlation-Based Sorting Algorithm of Inductive Modeling using Argument Rating,"In this paper, a sparse regression algorithm is proposed that corresponds to a linear model with the smallest possible number of regressors without loss of quality of the model based on correlation analysis and using an external criterion for choosing an optimal model based on the division of the input data sample. That is why the proposed method relates to the class of GMDH algorithms. The main stages of the algorithm work are described. The core feature of the algorithm is the use of frequency analysis of regressor ratings. The results of testing its effectiveness on test experiments are shown in comparison with the known algorithm LASSO.",2019,2019 IEEE 14th International Conference on Computer Sciences and Information Technologies (CSIT)
Comparing high-dimensional confounder control methods for rapid cohort studies from electronic health records,"Aims: Electronic health records (EHR), containing rich clinical histories of large patient populations, can provide evidence for clinical decisions when evidence from trials and literature is absent. To enable such observational studies from EHR in real time, particularly in emergencies, rapid confounder control methods that can handle numerous variables and adjust for biases are imperative. This study compares the performance of 18 automatic confounder control methods. Methods: Methods include propensity scores, direct adjustment by machine learning, similarity matching and resampling in two simulated and one real-world EHR datasets. Results & conclusion: Direct adjustment by lasso regression and ensemble models involving multiple resamples have performance comparable to expert-based propensity scores and thus, may help provide real-time EHR-based evidence for timely clinical decisions.

Pre-Selection in Cluster Lasso Methods for Correlated Variable Selection in High-Dimensional Linear Models,"We consider variable selection problems in high dimensional sparse regression models with strongly correlated variables. To handle correlated variables, the concept of clustering or grouping variables and then pursuing model fitting is widely accepted. When the dimension is very high, finding an appropriate group structure is as difficult as the original problem. We propose to use Elastic-net as a pre-selection step for Cluster Lasso methods (i.e. Cluster Group Lasso and Cluster Representative Lasso). The Elastic-net selects correlated relevant variables, but it fails to reveal the correlation structure among the active variables. We use cluster Lasso methods to address shortcoming of the Elastic-net, and the Elasticnet is used to provide reduced feature set for the cluster Lasso methods. We theoretically explore, the group selection consistency of the proposed combination of algorithms under various conditions, i.e. Irrepresentable Condition (IC), Elastic-net Irrepresentable Condition (EIC) and Group Irrepresentable Condition (GIC). We support the theory using simulated and real dataset examples.",2017,
Predictive State Smoothing (PRESS): Scalable non-parametric regression for high-dimensional data with variable selection,"We introduce predictive state smoothing (PRESS), a novel semi-parametric regression technique for high-dimensional data using predictive state representations. PRESS is a fully probabilistic model for the optimal kernel smoothing matrix. We present efficient algorithms for the joint estimation of the state space as well as the non-linear mapping of observations to predictive states and as an alternative algorithms to minimize leave-one-out cross validation error. The proposed estimator is straightforward to implement using (stochastic) gradient descent and scales well for large N and large p. LASSO penalty parameters as well the optimal smoothness can be estimated as part of the optimization. Finally we show that out-of-sample predictions are on par with or better than alternative state-of-the-art regression methods on the abalone and MNIST benchmark datasets. Yet unlike alternative methods PRESS gives meaningful domainspecific insights and can be used for statistical inference via regression coefficients.",2017,
[Biomass Compositional Analysis Using Sparse Partial Least Squares Regression and Near Infrared Spectrum Technique].,"Forest bio-fuel, a new type renewable energy, has attracted increasing attention as a promising alternative. In this study, a new method called Sparse Partial Least Squares Regression (SPLS) is used to construct the proximate analysis model to analyze the fuel characteristics of sawdust combining Near Infrared Spectrum Technique. Moisture, Ash, Volatile and Fixed Carbon percentage of 80 samples have been measured by traditional proximate analysis. Spectroscopic data were collected by Nicolet NIR spectrometer. After being filtered by wavelet transform, all of the samples are divided into training set and validation set according to sample category and producing area. SPLS, Principle Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) are presented to construct prediction model. The result advocated that SPLS can select grouped wavelengths and improve the prediction performance. The absorption peaks of the Moisture is covered in the selected wavelengths, well other compositions have not been confirmed yet.

The Application of Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers on 1 l -norms Problems,"l 1 regularization is commonly used for variable or model selection, and it is often incorporated into the penalized likelihood framework for the sparse solutions. Lasso, group lasso and graphical lasso are three representative methods among them. The objective functions of these methods all contain a l l penalized term. Several algorithms have been developed to solve those problems, such as least angle regression for lasso, group nonnegative garrote for group lasso and block coordinate descent for graphical lasso. However, they are designed for the solution of a specific problem and none of them can solve l 1 -norm problems generally. A convex optimization algorithm called ADMM(Alternating Direction method of multipliers)splits targets problems into two distinct parts and handles them separately, which makes it a natural fit for l 1 -norm problems consisting of a likelihood term and a penalty term. Based on the methodology of ADMM, we derived a framework for the solution of lasso, group lasso and graphical lasso. The proposed framework outperforms the existing methods in simulations. Finally, we apply our method to analyze a birth weight dataset birthwt which could be found in R package MASS.",2019,
OP XII â€“ 1 Assessing the cumulative health effect following short term exposure to multiple pollutants: an evaluation of methodological approaches using simulations and real data,"Background/aim Assessment of the cumulative effect of correlated exposures is an open methodological issue in environmental epidemiology. Previous studies applied regression models with interaction terms or dimension reduction methods. The joint effect of pollutants has been also evaluated using weighted exposure scores with weights based on the strength of the specific pollutant-health outcomes associations. Methods We compared three approaches addressing multipollutant exposures in epidemiological models: main effects models, the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and a weighted exposure score. We assessed the performance of the methods by simulations under various scenarios for the pollutantsâ€™ correlations. We further applied the three methods to time series data from Athens, Greece for 2007â€“2012 to investigate the combined effect of short-term exposure to six regulated pollutants on all-cause and respiratory mortality. Results The weighted exposure score provided the least biassed cumulative estimate under all correlation scenarios for both mortality outcomes. The adaptive LASSO performed well in the case of low and medium correlation between exposures while models including all exposures linearly seriously biassed the estimate of interest. In the real data application, the cumulative effect estimate on overall mortality was similar between approaches ranging from 1.12% increase in main effects models to 0.73% in the score, while the cumulative effect on respiratory mortality resulted in variable estimates, that ranged from âˆ’0.61% increase for adaptive LASSO to 2.77% for the score approach, with overlapping confidence intervals. Conclusion The use of a weighted exposure score to address cumulative effects of correlated metrics may perform well under different exposure correlation structures and different variability in the health outcomes. Future work should assess the performance of methods under variable lag structures per pollutant or non-linear associations between pollutants and outcomes.",2018,Occupational and Environmental Medicine
Simultaneous analysis of Lasso and Dantzig selector,"We show that, under a sparsity scenario, the Lasso estimator and the Dantzig selector exhibit similar behavior.

Minimum Distance Estimation for Robust High-Dimensional Regression,"We propose a minimum distance estimation method for robust regression in sparse high-dimensional settings. The traditional likelihood-based estimators lack resilience against outliers, a critical issue when dealing with high-dimensional noisy data. Our method, Minimum Distance Lasso (MD-Lasso), combines minimum distance functionals, customarily used in nonparametric estimation for their robustness, with l1-regularization for high-dimensional regression. The geometry of MD-Lasso is key to its consistency and robustness. The estimator is governed by a scaling parameter that caps the influence of outliers: the loss per observation is locally convex and close to quadratic for small squared residuals, and flattens for squared residuals larger than the scaling parameter. As the parameter approaches infinity, the estimator becomes equivalent to least-squares Lasso. MD-Lasso enjoys fast convergence rates under mild conditions on the model error distribution, which hold for any of the solutions in a convexity region around the true parameter and in certain cases for every solution. Remarkably, a first-order optimization method is able to produce iterates very close to the consistent solutions, with geometric convergence and regardless of the initialization. A connection is established with re-weighted least-squares that intuitively explains MD-Lasso robustness. The merits of our method are demonstrated through simulation and eQTL data analysis.",2013,arXiv: Methodology
Methods for detection of interactions with multiple components,"Methods for Detection of Interactions with Multiple Components Hristina Pashova Co-Chairs of the Supervisory Committee: PhD Charles Kooperberg Biostatistics PhD Michael LeBlanc Biostatistics In genetic association studies, it is typically thought that important insights will be obtained through joint modeling of genetic variants and environmental variables. However, weak effect of gene-environment interactions, and imprecise measurement of the environment make it hard to identify statistically significant interaction effects. We propose two different modeling techniques. First, for regression problems in which the main effects are already established, as is the case with many diseases or their estimation is not a priority, we propose the use of dedicated boosting. Dedicated boosting is a variation to the usual `2 boosting procedure which focuses on the interaction search in contrast to most boosting methods which address overall model prediction or classification. We compare the performance of dedicated boosting to other competing methods in the WHI data and a simulation study. Secondly, we use the idea of a structured interaction model form together with penalized regression to limit model complexity in regression problems where we believe interactions might behave in a similar way. We propose the directed LASSO, a regression modeling strategy using a pairwise fused LASSO penalty to encourage interaction model simplicity through fusion.",2013,

Intra- and inter-sparse multiple output regression with application on environmental microbial community study,"Feature selection is important for many biological studies, especially when the number of available samples is limited (in order of hundreds) while the number of input features is large (in order of millions), such as eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) mapping, GWAS (genome wide association study) and environmental microbial community study. We study the problem of multiple output regression which leverages the underlying common relationship shared by multiple output features and propose an efficient and accurate approach for feature selection. Our approach considers both intra- and inter-group sparsities. The intergroup sparsity assumes that only small set of input features are related to the output features. The intragroup sparsity assumes that each input features may relate to multiple output features which should have different kinds of sparsity. Most existing methods do not model the intragroup sparsity well by either assuming uniform regularization on each group, i.e. each input feature relates to similar number of output features, or requiring prior knowledge of the relationship of input and output features. By modelling the regression coefficients as a mixture distributions of Laplacian and Gaussian, we can shrink group regression coefficients to be small adaptively and learn the intergroup, intragroup sparsity and shrinkage estimation patterns. Empirical studies on the synthetic and real environmental microbial community datasets show that our model has better predictions on test dataset than existing methods such as Lasso, Elastic Net, dirty model and rMTFL (robust multi-task feature learning). Moreover, by using least angle regression or coordinate descent and projected gradient descent techniques for optimization, we can obtain the optimal regression efficiently.",2013,2013 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine
Prediction models and risk assessment for silicosis using a retrospective cohort study among workers exposed to silica in China,"This study aims to develop a prognostic risk prediction model for the development of silicosis among workers exposed to silica dust in China. The prediction model was performed by using retrospective cohort of 3,492 workers exposed to silica in an iron ore, with 33 years of follow-up. We developed a risk score system using a linear combination of the predictors weighted by the LASSO penalized Cox regression coefficients. The model's predictive accuracy was evaluated using time-dependent ROC curves. Six predictors were selected into the final prediction model (age at entry of the cohort, mean concentration of respirable silica, net years of dust exposure, smoking, illiteracy, and no. of jobs). We classified workers into three risk groups according to the quartile (Q1, Q3) of risk score; 203 (23.28%) incident silicosis cases were derived from the high risk group (risk score â‰¥ 5.91), whilst only 4 (0.46%) cases were from the low risk group (risk score < 3.97). The score system was regarded as accurate given the range of AUCs (83-96%). This study developed a unique score system with a good internal validity, which provides scientific guidance to the clinicians to identify high-risk workers, thus has important cost efficient implications.",2015,Scientific Reports
"Colonic volvulus in the United States: trends, outcomes, and predictors of mortality.","INTRODUCTION
Colonic volvulus is a rare entity associated with high mortality rates. Most studies come from areas of high endemicity and are limited by small numbers. No studies have investigated trends, outcomes, and predictors of mortality at the national level.


METHODS
The Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2002-2010 was retrospectively reviewed for colonic volvulus cases admitted emergently. Patients' demographics, hospital factors, and outcomes of the different procedures were analyzed. The LASSO algorithm for logistic regression was used to build a predictive model for mortality in cases of sigmoid (SV) and cecal volvulus (CV) taking into account preoperative and operative variables.


RESULTS
An estimated 3,351,152 cases of bowel obstruction were admitted in the United States over the study period. Colonic volvulus was found to be the cause in 63,749 cases (1.90%). The incidence of CV increased by 5.53% per year whereas the incidence of SV remained stable. SV was more common in elderly males (aged 70 years), African Americans, and patients with diabetes and neuropsychiatric disorders. In contrast, CV was more common in younger females. Nonsurgical decompression alone was used in 17% of cases. Among cases managed surgically, resective procedures were performed in 89% of cases, whereas operative detorsion with or without fixation procedures remained uncommon. Mortality rates were 9.44% for SV, 6.64% for CV, 17% for synchronous CV and SV, and 18% for transverse colon volvulus. The LASSO algorithm identified bowel gangrene and peritonitis, coagulopathy, age, the use of stoma, and chronic kidney disease as strong predictors of mortality.


CONCLUSIONS
Colonic volvulus is a rare cause of bowel obstruction in the United States and is associated with high mortality rates. CV and SV affect different populations and the incidence of CV is on the rise. The presence of bowel gangrene and coagulopathy strongly predicts mortality, suggesting that prompt diagnosis and management are essential.",2014,Annals of surgery
"Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and statins: no effect on ablation outcome after ablation of atrial fibrillation.","BACKGROUND
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and inflammation are supposed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). This retrospective clinical study was intended to assess the influence of drugs with antiinflammatory and/or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-modulating properties, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and statins, on AF-free survival after AF ablation.


METHODS
The study included 234 patients (23-80 years; 71.8% men) with drug-resistant paroxysmal (n = 165) or persistent AF (n = 69) who either underwent a Lasso-guided segmental pulmonary vein isolation (n = 83) or a CARTO-guided left atrial circumferential ablation (n = 151). Treatment with statins (n = 113), ACE-Is, or ARBs (n = 124), or a combination of a statin and an ACE-I or ARB (n = 75) was started >3 months before ablation and was continued during follow-up.


RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 12.7 months, 64% of patients with paroxysmal and 45% of patients with persistent AF were free of AF. Statin use (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; P = .79), ACE-I or ARB use (HR, 1.12; P = .59), and their combined use (statin + ACE-I/ARB; HR, 1.17; P = .54) did not significantly influence ablation outcome as assessed by Cox regression analysis. In addition, after multivariate adjustment for potential confounders, the examined drugs did not significantly affect ablation outcome. Ablation induced an acute up-regulation of C-reactive protein levels (preablation vs 48 hours postablation, 5.9 +/- 8.1 vs 33.7 +/- 30 mg/L; P < .001) and other inflammatory markers. The examined drugs did not significantly alter baseline levels or ablation-induced up-regulation of inflammatory markers.

CRRS: Custom Regression and Regularisation Solver for Large-Scale Linear Systems,"This paper presents novel regression and regularisation techniques based on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology for large-scale datasets for machine learning and other applications. We introduce a customisable design which allows end-users to select their regression and regularisation techniques from a library supporting relevant methods such as Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Adaptive/Lasso Regression and Elastic Net Regularisation. We introduce the first Adaptive Elastic Net architecture for FPGAs. Tests on dense and sparse datasets of varying sizes show 158 times speedup and 114 times enhancement in energy efficiency when comparing an 8-FPGA system with the corresponding software C++ implementation on a 12-core CPU, for an Adaptive Elastic Net regularisation of a matrix with 11.56*10^9 coefficients.",2018,2018 28th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)
Weather index insurance design: a novel approach for crop insurance in Brazil,"Weather index insurance design: a novel approach for crop insurance in Brazil Crop insurance is recognized as one of the most efficient mechanisms of income protection in agriculture, transferring risk from agriculture to other agents and economic sectors. Insurance tends to stimulate the increase of cultivated area and the use of technology, especially as it acts as an additional guarantee for access to credit. In Brazil, however, the massification of rural insurance is limited due to the restricted budget to fund government subsidization. Also, the lack of predictability and guarantee of resources prevents the long-term planning of investments by the private sector, imposes costs on the beneficiaries and generates dissatisfaction of the target public. This thesis aims to contribute to the expansion of crop insurance in Brazil through the research of index insurance, which has lower administrative and claim adjustment costs when compared to traditional insurance. The absence of in situ claim adjustment and moral hazard monitoring reduces the administrative costs of this type of insurance, permitting a subsidy free crop insurance. In the first of two articles, we explore the availability and quality of public databases for soybean yields and daily rainfall in the state of ParanÃ¡ in Brazil in order to verify the feasibility of an index insurance product. We use multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) to fill missing values in the rainfall dataset and study the existence of spatial and temporal patterns in the data by means of hierarchical clustering. Our results indicate that ParanÃ¡ fulfills data requirements for a scalable weather index insurance with MICE and hierarchical clustering being effective tools in the pre-processing of data. The second article studies the efficiency of a novel regression approach, the geographically weighted quantile LASSO (GWQLASSO) in the modelling of yield-index relationship for weather index insurance products. GWQLASSO allows regression coefficients to vary spatially, while using the information from neighboring locations to derive robust estimates. The LASSO component of the model facilitates the selection of relevant explanatory variables. A weather index insurance (WII) product is developed based on 1-month SPI derived from a daily precipitation dataset for 41 weather stations in the State of ParanÃ¡ (Brazil) for the period of 1979 through 2015. Soybean yield data are also used for the 41 municipalities from 1980 through 2015. The effectiveness of the GWQLASSO product is evaluated against a classic quantile regression approach and a traditional yield insurance product using the Spectral Risk Measure (SRM) and the Mean Semi-deviation. While GWQLASSO proved as effective as quantile regression it outperformed the yield insurance product, thus proving an alternative to the crop insurance market in Brazil and other locations with limited data.",2019,
Discovery and Confirmation of Diagnostic Serum Lipid Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease Using Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder lacking early biochemical diagnosis and treatment. Lipids have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including AD. A shotgun lipidomic approach was undertaken to determine if lipid biomarkers exist that can discriminate AD cases from controls. The discovery study involved sera from 29Â different stage AD cases and 32 controls. Lipid extraction was performed using organic solvent and the samples were directly infused into a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Differences between AD cases and controls were detected with 87 statistically significant lipid candidate markers found. These potential lipid markers were reevaluated in a second confirmatory study involving 27 cases and 30 controls. Of the 87 candidates from the first study, 35 continued to be statistically significant in the second confirmatory set. Tandem MS studies were performed and almost all confirmed markers were characterized and classified. Using a Bayesian lasso probit regression model on the confirmed markers, a multi-marker set with AUCâ€Š=â€Š0.886 was developed comparing all stages of AD with controls. Additionally, using confirmed biomarkers, multi-marker sets with AUCsâ€Š>0.90 were developed for each specific AD Clinical Dementia Rating versus controls, including the earliest stage of AD. More conservative and likely more realistic statistical analyses still found multi-marker sets that appeared useful in diagnosing AD. Finally, using ordinal modeling a set of markers was developed that staged AD accurately 70% of the time, pâ€Š=â€Š0.0079. These results suggest that these serum lipidomic biomarkers may help diagnose and perhaps even stage AD.",2017,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
Deep Learning-Based Quantitative Computed Tomography Model in Predicting the Severity of COVID-19: A Retrospective Study in 196 Patients,"Background: The assessment of the severity of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by clinical presentations cannot met the urgently clinical need so far. We aimed to establish a model of deep learning (DL)-based quantitative computed tomography (CT) and initial clinical features in prediction of the severity of COVID-19. 
 
Methods: One hundred and ninety-six hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from Jan 20 to Feb 10, 2020 in our center, and were divided into the severe and non-severe group. The clinico-radiological data at admission were compared between the two groups. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model for predicting the severity of COVID-19 was established, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) values of the model, quantitative CT parameters significantly different in univariate analysis, and pneumonia severity index (PSI) were compared. 
 
Findings: In comparison with non-severe group (151 cases), severe patients (45 cases) had higher PSI (p<0.001). DL-based quantitative CT indicated that the mass of infection (MOICT) and the percentage of infection (POICT) in the severe group was higher (p<0.001).The LASSO logistic regression model was based on MOICT together with clinical features including age, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), CD4+ T cell counts. The AUC value for the model was 0.890, and was significantly higher than that for MOICT, POICT, or PSI score (all p<0.01). 
 
Interpretation: The DL-based quantitative CT model has more efficiency in predicting the severity of COVID-19 than quantitative CT parameters and PSI score do.

Forward Regression for Ultra-High Dimensional Variable Screening,"Motivated by the seminal theory of Sure Independence Screening (Fan and Lv 2008, SIS), we investigate here another popular and classical variable screening method, namely, forward regression (FR). Our theoretical analysis reveals that FR can identify all relevant predictors consistently, even if the predictor dimension is substantially larger than the sample size. In particular, if the dimension of the true model is finite, FR can discover all relevant predictors within a finite number of steps. To practically select the â€œbestâ€ candidate from the models generated by FR, the recently proposed BIC criterion of Chen and Chen (2008) can be used. The resulting model can then serve as an excellent starting point, from where many existing variable selection methods (e.g., SCAD and Adaptive LASSO) can be applied directly. FRâ€™s outstanding finite sample performances are confirmed by extensive numerical studies.",2009,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Collective Support Recovery for Multi-Design Multi-Response Linear Regression,"The multi-design multi-response linear regression problem is investigated, in which design matrices are Gaussian with covariance matrices Î£<sup>(1:K)</sup> = (Î£<sup>(1)</sup>, ... , 1<sup>(K)</sup>) for K linear regression tasks. Design matrices across tasks are assumed to be independent. The support union of K p-dimensional regression vectors (collected as columns of matrix B*) is recovered using l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>2</sub>-regularized lasso. Sufficient and necessary conditions on sample complexity are characterized as a sharp threshold to guarantee successful recovery of the support union. This model has been previously studied via l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>âˆž</sub>-regularized lassoand via l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>1</sub> + l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>âˆž</sub>-regularized lasso, in which sharp threshold on sample complexity is characterized only for K = 2 and under special conditions. In this paper, using l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>2</sub>-regularized lasso, sharp threshold on sample complexity is characterized under standard regularization conditions. Namely, if n > c<sub>p1</sub>Ïˆ(B*, Î£<sup>(1:K)</sup>) log(p - s) where c<sub>p1</sub> is a constant, and s is the size of the support set, then l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>2</sub>-regularized lasso correctly recovers the support union; and if n <; c<sub>p2</sub>Ïˆ(B*, Î£<sup>(1:K)</sup>)log(p - s) where c<sub>p2</sub> is a constant, then l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>2</sub>-regularized lasso fails to recover the support union. In particular, the function Ïˆ(B*, Î£<sup>(1:K)</sup>) captures the impact of the sparsity of K regression vectors and the statistical properties of the design matrices on the threshold on sample complexity. Therefore, such threshold function also demonstrates the advantages of joint support union recovery using multitask lasso over individual support recovery using single-task lasso.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
"Prediction of internal egg quality characteristics and variable selection using regularization methods: ridge, LASSO and elastic net","Abstract. This study was conducted to determine the inner quality characteristics of
eggs using external egg quality characteristics. The variables were selected in
order to obtain the simplest model using ridge, LASSO and elastic net
regularization methods. For this purpose, measurements of the internal and external characteristics of 117 Japanese quail eggs
were made. Internal quality characteristics were egg yolk
weight and albumen weight; external quality characteristics were egg width,
egg length, egg weight, shape index and shell weight. An ordinary
least square method was applied to the data. Ridge, LASSO and elastic net
regularization methods were performed to remove the multicollinearity of the data.
The regression estimating equations of the internal egg
quality were significant for all methods ( P ). The goodness of fit of the regression
estimating equations for egg yolk weight was 58.34, 59.17 and 59.11â€‰%
for the ridge, LASSO and elastic net methods, respectively. For egg albumen weight the goodness of fit of the regression
estimating equations was 75.60â€‰%, 75.94â€‰% and 75.81â€‰% for the respective ridge, LASSO and elastic net
methods. It was revealed that LASSO, including two predictors
for both egg yolk weight and egg albumen weight, was the best model with
regard to high predictive accuracy.",2018,Archives Animal Breeding
Thresholded Lasso for high dimensional variable selection,"Given n noisy samples with p dimensions, where n "" p, we show that the multi-step thresholding procedure based on the Lasso â€“ we call it the Thresholded Lasso, can accurately estimate a sparse vector Î² âˆˆ R in a linear model Y = XÎ² + "", where XnÃ—p is a design matrix normalized to have column #2-norm âˆš n, and "" âˆ¼ N(0, ÏƒIn). We show that under the restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition (BickelRitov-Tsybakov 09), it is possible to achieve the #2 loss within a logarithmic factor of the ideal mean square error one would achieve with an oracle while selecting a sufficiently sparse model â€“ hence achieving sparse oracle inequalities; the oracle would supply perfect information about which coordinates are non-zero and which are above the noise level. We also show for the Gauss-Dantzig selector (CandÃ¨s-Tao 07), ifX obeys a uniform uncertainty principle, one will achieve the sparse oracle inequalities as above, while allowing at most s0 irrelevant variables in the model in the worst case, where s0 â‰¤ s is the smallest integer such that for Î» = âˆš 2 log p/n, âˆ‘p i=1 min(Î² 2 i , Î» Ïƒ) â‰¤ s0Î»Ïƒ.

Correlates of sleep quality in midlife and beyond: a machine learning analysis.,"OBJECTIVES
In older adults, traditional metrics derived from polysomnography (PSG) are not well correlated with subjective sleep quality. Little is known about whether the association between PSG and subjective sleep quality changes with age, or whether quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) is associated with sleep quality. Therefore, we examined the relationship between subjective sleep quality and objective sleep characteristics (standard PSG and qEEG) across middle to older adulthood.


METHODS
Using cross-sectional analyses of 3173 community-dwelling men and women aged between 39 and 90 participating in the Sleep Heart Health Study, we examined the relationship between a morning rating of the prior night's sleep quality (sleep depth and restfulness) and polysomnographic, and qEEG descriptors of that single night of sleep, along with clinical and demographic measures. Multivariable models were constructed using two machine learning methods, namely lasso penalized regressions and random forests.


RESULTS
Little variance was explained across models. Greater objective sleep efficiency, reduced wake after sleep onset, and fewer sleep-to-wake stage transitions were each associated with higher sleep quality; qEEG variables contributed little explanatory power. The oldest adults reported the highest sleep quality even as objective sleep deteriorated such that they would rate their sleep better, given the same level of sleep efficiency. Despite this, there were no major differences in the predictors of subjective sleep across the age span.


CONCLUSION
Standard metrics derived from PSG, including qEEG, contribute little to explaining subjective sleep quality in middle-aged to older adults. The objective correlates of subjective sleep quality do not appear to systematically change with age despite a change in the relationship between subjective sleep quality and objective sleep efficiency.",2017,Sleep medicine
Prediction of the result in race walking using regularized regression models,"The following paper presents the use of regularized linear models as tools to optimize training process. The models were calculated by using data collected from race-walkers' training events. The models used predict the outcomes over a 3 km race and following a prescribed training plan. The material included a total of 122 training patterns made by 21 players. The methods of analysis include: classical model of OLS regression, ridge regression, LASSO regression and elastic net regression. In order to compare and choose the best method a cross-validation of the leave-one-out was used. All models were calculated using R language with additional packages. The best model was determined by the LASSO method which generates an error of about 26 seconds. The method has simplified the structure of the model by eliminating 5 out of 18 predictors.",2013,Applied Computer Science
Support recovery and sup-norm convergence rates for sparse pivotal estimation,"In high dimensional sparse regression, pivotal estimators are estimators for which the optimal regularization parameter is independent of the noise level. The canonical pivotal es-timator is the square-root Lasso, formulated along with its derivatives as a ""non-smooth + non-smooth"" optimization problem. Modern techniques to solve these include smoothing the datafitting term, to benefit from fast efficient proximal algorithms. In this work we show minimax sup-norm convergence rates for non smoothed and smoothed, single task and multitask square-root Lasso-type estima-tors. Thanks to our theoretical analysis, we provide some guidelines on how to set the smoothing hyperparameter, and illustrate on synthetic data the interest of such guidelines.",2020,ArXiv
