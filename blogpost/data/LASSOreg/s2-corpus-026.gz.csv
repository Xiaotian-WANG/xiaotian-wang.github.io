Coordinate descent algorithms for lasso penalized regression,"Imposition of a lasso penalty shrinks parameter estimates toward zero and performs continuous model selection. Lasso penalized regression is capable of handling linear regression problems where the number of predictors far exceeds the number of cases. This paper tests two exceptionally fast algorithms for estimating regression coefficients with a lasso penalty. The previously known l 2 algorithm is based on cyclic coordinate descent. Our new l 1 algorithm is based on greedy coordinate descent and Edgeworth's algorithm for ordinary l 1 regression. Each algorithm relies on a tuning constant that can be chosen by cross-validation. In some regression problems it is natural to group parameters and penalize parameters group by group rather than separately. If the group penalty is proportional to the Euclidean norm of the parameters of the group, then it is possible to majorize the norm and reduce parameter estimation to l 2 regression with a lasso penalty. Thus. the existing algorithm can be extended to novel settings. Each of the algorithms discussed is tested via either simulated or real data or both. The Appendix proves that a greedy form of the l 2 algorithm converges to the minimum value of the objective function.",2008,The Annals of Applied Statistics
From Bayes Calculus to Efficient Integration of Studies,"My thesis contains three main parts: the first part discusses a theoretical development in Bayes calculations, while the latter two parts focus on statistical methods with the applications to genetics. The focus of the talk is on a new meta-analysis approach to identify common predictors from multiple related studies. Identifying molecular signatures for complex diseases remains one major objective in gene expression studies. Commonly used strategies mainly investigate one gene expression study at a time, where the combination of small sample size and a large number of genetic predictors often leads to low detection power and to inaccuracy in the estimation of the set of relevant genes. We present here methodology for improving the power of identifying gene signatures by combining summary statistics from several relevant studies. The group lasso proposed by Yuan and Lin (2006) could be used for this purpose, where the regression coefficients of the same predictor across multiple studies naturally form a group. Their approach is challenged when predictors have heterogeneous effects or effect direction coherence. Motivated by these issues, we introduce a nonparametric approach called Meta-Rank Selection. Our three-step approach first infers the rank of a predictor and its marginal correlation with the response in each individual study, combines the two scores to form a consensus ranking path of all predictors, then selects the relevant predictors along the consensus ranking path. We present theoretical properties of Meta-Rank Selection and use simulations to compare its performance with other methods such as the group lasso. We also discuss its extensions, including ways to incorporate effect direction coherence and tools to deal with strong correlations among predictors.

Chapter 5 Application of Boosting Technique to Ridge Regression 5,"Schapire (1990) introduced boosting as a common method which attempts to boost the precision of any learning algorithm. Boosting is one of the most successful and useful methods introduced in the last eighteen years. The goal of boosting is to improve the performance of weak learning algorithms by combining them in a certain way. The first algorithm of this type was developed by Schapire (1990). The second algorithm, developed by Freund (1995), it was a more efficient boosting algorithm. It was originally designed for classification problems, but it can be extended to regression. Schapire and Freund (1996) came up with the idea of a more practical version of boosting and proposed the algorithm called AdaBoost that combines simple classification rules into more powerful and precise classification algorithms. Friedman (2001) developed boosting methods for regression which are implemented for optimization using the RSS function: this is what we call L2Boosting. Boosting technique can be useful to iteratively fit the current residuals. Duffy and Helmbold (2002) gave a brief overview of boosting and contrasted the classification and regression settings. Buhimann and Yu (2003) proposed an algorithm called L2Boost in linear model. They constructed it from the L2 loss function. L2 loss is suitable for regression. Therefore, they proposed to use L2Boost for a regression problem and not necessarily with Multicollinearity. Boosting of an estimator means that the estimator is applied iteratively to the residuals of the previous iteration. Efron et al. (2004) proposed LARS algorithm as a combination of forward stage-wise linear regression (FSLR), which seems closely related to L2Boost, and the L\ penalized Lasso (see Tibshirani, 1996). Some",2016,
Ultra-Deep Targeted Sequencing Does Not Identify MM Patients with Different Prognosis: Results from a Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revealed new insight into the complexity of clonal and subclonal architecture of multiple myeloma (MM). The introduction of targeted studies allows the detection of mutations with very low allele frequencies at affordable price. However, there is few information about the prognostic impact of this mutational profile in series of homogeneously treated MM patients. In this study, we analyzed the most frequently mutated genes in MM from patients included in a randomized clinical trial applying the highest read depth to date. We performed a correlation study between our results and cytogenetics aberrations and clinical outcomes. We used Ampliseq Library Kit 2.0 to target 77 genes (M3Pv2.0 panel) related to critical pathophysiological pathways, associated to drug resistance or targetable with molecular drugs in MM. We sequenced DNA (15ng) from CD138+ purified plasma cells from 80 MM patients at diagnosis included in GEM2010MAS65 clinical trial. We sequenced at an average read depth of 1500X and using Ion Proton sequencer (Thermo Fisher, USA, PaloAlto, CA). We used Ion Reporter software applying in-house modifications in call variants process. We also sequenced DNA from CD138 negative population in 30% of patients in order to filter out potential artifacts and stablish conditions for excluding germline variants. We first fitted a cox-proportional hazard model to predict survival and a second approach using a penalized regression LASSO. We identified 137 gene mutations in the 80 patients analyzed, 54 mutations were predicted pathogenic by Shif and Poliphen and 65 have been described in COSMIC database. 85% of patients harbored at least 1 mutation. The most frequently mutated genes were KRAS (16%) , DIS3 (15%) , NRAS (13%) , BRAF (6%) , and TP53 (5%) , accounting for the 54% of the total number of mutations. The most frequently mutated pathways were RAS and NFKB in 34% and 28% of patients respectively. Mutational allele frequency for KRAS , BRAF and TP53 was, in all cases, lower than 50% while DIS3 showed mutations in a broad range (from 2 to 85%). Only one patient presented one mutation in NRAS at 73 % of allele frequency. For patients with more than one mutation, two different scenarios have been found. Some patients showed several genes mutated in a similar allele frequency values. On the contrary, a complex subclonal structure was confirmed in 3 patients, with mutations at very different clonal frequency. CD138 negative fraction was sequenced to confirm that these mutations were exclusive of plasma cells. The first of them had two mutations in DIS3 at 8 and 53% of allele frequency, second in KRAS and DIS3 at 13 and 63% respectively and the third in NRAS and IFNGR2 at 5 and 37% respectively. We found no differences in the survival based on pathway, mutational allele frequency or number of mutations. We also investigated pairwise associations between events and we not found significant correlations (Figure 1). Cox-proportional hazard model only showed a negative impact in survival of patients with TP53 mutations. This ultra-deep targeted sequencing strategy is able to detect mutations in most of patients, at very low allele frequency and using a minimal amount of DNA. Despite of its huge capacity to detect mutations, we have not identified new prognostic factors in MM patients treated with highly efficient therapies. However, this study again confirms the complexity of the genomic landscape of MM and the great heterogeneity between patients. The role of theses mutations at relapse as well as in the subsequent treatment effectiveness remains unknown and should be preferably investigated in larger cohorts of homogeneously treated MM patients.

Upweighting rare favourable alleles increases long-term genetic gain in genomic selection programs,"BackgroundThe short-term impact of using different genomic prediction (GP) models in genomic selection has been intensively studied, but their long-term impact is poorly understood. Furthermore, long-term genetic gain of genomic selection is expected to improve by using Janninkâ€™s weighting (JW) method, in which rare favourable marker alleles are upweighted in the selection criterion. In this paper, we extend the JW method by including an additional parameter to decrease the emphasis on rare favourable alleles over the time horizon, with the purpose of further improving the long-term genetic gain. We call this new method dynamic weighting (DW). The paper explores the long-term impact of different GP models with or without weighting methods.MethodsDifferent selection criteria were tested by simulating a population of 500 animals with truncation selection of five males and 50 females. Selection criteria included unweighted and weighted genomic estimated breeding values using the JW or DW methods, for which ridge regression (RR) and Bayesian lasso (BL) were used to estimate marker effects. The impacts of these selection criteria were compared under three genetic architectures, i.e. varying numbers of QTL for the trait and for two time horizons of 15 (TH15) or 40 (TH40) generations.ResultsFor unweighted GP, BL resulted in up to 21.4% higher long-term genetic gain and 23.5% lower rate of inbreeding under TH40 than RR. For weighted GP, DW resulted in 1.3 to 5.5% higher long-term gain compared to unweighted GP. JW, however, showed a 6.8% lower long-term genetic gain relative to unweighted GP when BL was used to estimate the marker effects. Under TH40, both DW and JW obtained significantly higher genetic gain than unweighted GP. With DW, the long-term genetic gain was increased by up to 30.8% relative to unweighted GP, and also increased by 8% relative to JW, although at the expense of a lower short-term gain.ConclusionsIrrespective of the number of QTL simulated, BL is superior to RR in maintaining genetic variance and therefore results in higher long-term genetic gain. Moreover, DW is a promising method with which high long-term genetic gain can be expected within a fixed time frame.",2015,"Genetics, Selection, Evolution : GSE"
$\textsf{LoPub}$ : High-Dimensional Crowdsourced Data Publication With Local Differential Privacy,"High-dimensional crowdsourced data collected from numerous users produces rich knowledge about our society; however, it also brings unprecedented privacy threats to the participants. Local differential privacy (LDP), a variant of differential privacy, is recently proposed as a state-of-the-art privacy notion. Unfortunately, achieving LDP on high-dimensional crowdsourced data publication raises great challenges in terms of both computational efficiency and data utility. To this end, based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and Lasso regression, we first propose efficient multi-dimensional joint distribution estimation algorithms with LDP. Then, we develop a local differentially private high-dimensional data publication algorithm (LoPub) by taking advantage of our distribution estimation techniques. In particular, correlations among multiple attributes are identified to reduce the dimensionality of crowdsourced data, thus speeding up the distribution learning process and achieving high data utility. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our multivariate distribution estimation scheme significantly outperforms existing estimation schemes in terms of both communication overhead and estimation speed. Moreover, LoPub can keep, on average, 80% and 60% accuracy over the released datasets in terms of support vector machine and random forest classification, respectively.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security
A LASSO Method to Identify Protein Signature Predicting Post-transplant Renal Graft Survival,"Identifying novel biomarkers to predict renal graft survival is important in post-transplant clinical practice. Serum creatinine, currently the most popular surrogate biomarker, offers limited information on the underlying allograft profiles. It is known to perform unsatisfactorily to predict renal function. In this paper, we apply a LASSO machine-learning algorithm in the Cox proportional hazards model to identify promising proteins that are associated with the hazard of allograft loss after renal transplantation, motivated by a clinical pilot study that collected 47 patients receiving renal transplants at the University of Michigan Hospital. We assess the association of 17 proteins previously identified by Cibrik et al.Â (PROTEOMICS Clin Appl 7(11â€“12): 839â€“849, 2013) with allograft rejection in our regularized Cox regression analysis, where the LASSO variable selection method is applied to select important proteins that predict the hazard of allograft loss. We also develop a post-selection inference to further investigate the statistical significance of the proteins on the hazard of allograft loss, and conclude that two proteins KIM-1 and VEGF-R2 are important protein markers for risk prediction.",2017,Statistics in Biosciences
Detection of malignant pleural mesothelioma in exhaled breath by multicapillary column/ion mobility spectrometry (MCC/IMS).,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is predominantly caused by previous asbestos exposure. Diagnosis often happens in advanced stages restricting any therapeutic perspectives. Early stage detection via breath analysis was explored using multicapillary column/ion mobility spectrometry (MCC/IMS) to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath of MPM patients in comparison to former occupational asbestos-exposed and non-exposed controls. Breath and background samples of 23 MPM patients, 22 asymptomatic former asbestos (AEx) workers and 21 healthy non-asbestos exposed persons were taken for analysis. After background correction, we performed a logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression to select the most important VOCs, followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. MPM patients were discriminated from both controls with 87% sensitivity, 70% specificity and respective positive and negative predictive values of 61% and 91%. The overall accuracy was 76% and the area under the ROC-curve was 0.81. AEx individuals could be discriminated from MPM patients with 87% sensitivity, 86% specificity and respective positive and negative predictive values of 87% and 86%. The overall accuracy was 87% with an area under the ROC-curve of 0.86. Breath analysis by MCC/IMS allows MPM patients to be discriminated from controls and holds promise for further investigation as a screening tool for former asbestos-exposed persons at risk of developing MPM.",2016,Journal of breath research
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Signature of Pain Anticipation and Clinical Depressive Symptomatology,"Author(s): Kadlec, Molly | Advisor(s): Tosun-Turgut, Duygu | Abstract: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study tested the hypothesis that individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) are more likely to anticipate negative outcomes. The participants included thirty-one (15 females) unmedicated adults diagnosed with MDD and twenty-two (11 females) healthy control subjects with no history of MDD. fMRI data were collected during an event-related pain-anticipation paradigm, during which participants were cued to anticipate painful heat stimuli. Stimuli were delivered at high (moderately painful sensation) or low (mild painful sensation) intensity, and all cues were either known (high and low pain cues), or unknown (50% probability of high or low pain, which was not known to the participant), with a total of fourteen known and fourteen unknown anticipation trials. Based on prior findings regarding the importance of the insula cortex during pain anticipation, twelve insular regions (six on each side) were examined. Single-subject multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to create subject-specific activation maps for each anticipation condition. The mean activation (beta coefficient) was extracted within each insular region and was subjected to linear regression by way of a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Following LASSO regression, prediction analysis was conducted on the test set (activation maps from fourteen unknown anticipation trials), based on the correlation with the training set (activation maps from fourteen known anticipation trials). Across each unknown anticipation trial, participantsâ€™ anticipation was classified as either high pain (HP) or low pain (LP). Several results were observed. First, we found that, within the chosen insular regions, neurobiological signatures of high and low pain anticipation were distinguishable at a high sensitivity. Second, the anterior short gyrus on the right side showed the highest deterministic beta coefficient in anticipatory predictions in our study. Third, we found that across both groups more of the unknown anticipatory conditions were labeled as HP. Fourth, in the current sample, we found no significant relationship with overall depressive symptoms severity and anticipatory labeling. Nevertheless, as hypothesized, significantly more cases of unknown anticipation were labeled as HP in the depressed cohort than in the control group (chi= 3.9; p l 0.05).",2018,
Lasso logistic regression based approach for extracting plants coregenes responding to abiotic stresses,"Sparse methods have a significant advantage of reducing gene expression data complexity to make them comprehensible and interpretable. In this paper, based on Lasso Logistic Regression (LLR), we propose a novel approach to extract plant characteristic gene set, namely coregenes, responding to abiotic stresses. Firstly, to obtain the regression coefficients, the lasso logistic regression was performed according to the samples. Then, the regression coefficients were sorted by the absolute value of them. Finally, the corresponding genes of the nonzero entries of the coefficients are selected as the coregene. Each of coregene extracted can capture the changes of the samples belong to the same condition. The experimental results show that the proposed LLR-based method is efficient to extract the coregenes concerning straight with the stresses.",2011,The Fourth International Workshop on Advanced Computational Intelligence
Radiomics for lung adenocarcinoma manifesting as pure ground-glass nodules: invasive prediction,"To investigate the value of radiomics based on CT imaging in predicting invasive adenocarcinoma manifesting as pure ground-glass nodules (pGGNs). This study enrolled 395 pGGNs with histopathology-confirmed benign nodules or adenocarcinoma. A total of 396 radiomic features were extracted from each labeled nodule. A Rad-score was constructed with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in the training set. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to establish the radiographic model and the combined radiographicâ€“radiomics model. The predictive performance was validated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis, an individual prediction nomogram was developed and the clinical utility was assessed. Five radiomic features and four radiographic features were selected for predicting the invasive lesions. The combined radiographicâ€“radiomics model (AUC 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69â€“0.86) performed better than the radiographic model (AUC 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62â€“0.81) and Rad-score (AUC 0.72; 95% CI, 0.63â€“0.81) in the validation set. The clinical utility of the individualized prediction nomogram developed using the Rad-score, margin, spiculation, and size was confirmed in the validation set. The decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated that using a model with Rad-score to predict the invasive lesion would be more beneficial than that without Rad-score and the clinical model. The proposed radiomics-based nomogram that incorporated the Rad-score, margin, spiculation, and size may be utilized as a noninvasive biomarker for the assessment of invasive prediction in patients with pGGNs. â€¢ CT-based radiomics analysis helps invasive prediction manifested as pGGNs. â€¢ The combined radiographicâ€“radiomics model may be utilized as a noninvasive biomarker for predicting invasive lesion for pGGNs. â€¢ Radiomics-based individual nomogram may serve as a vital decision support tool to identify invasive pGGNs, obviating further workup and blind follow-up.",2020,European Radiology
GBS-Based Genomic Selection for Pea Grain Yield under Severe Terminal Drought.,"Terminal drought is the main stress that limits pea ( L.) grain yield in Mediterranean-climate regions. This study provides an unprecedented assessment of the predictive ability of genomic selection (GS) for grain yield under severe terminal drought using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data. Additional aims were to assess the GS predictive ability for different GBS data quality filters and GS models, comparing intrapopulation with interpopulation GS predictive ability and to perform genome-wide association (GWAS) studies. The yield and onset of flowering of 315 lines from three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations issued by connected crosses between three elite cultivars were assessed under a field rainout shelter. We defined an adjusted yield, which is associated with intrinsic drought tolerance, as the yield deviation from the value expected as a function of onset of flowering (which correlated negatively with grain yield). Total polymorphic markers ranged from approximately 100 (minimum of eight reads per locus, maximum 10% genotype missing data) to over 7500 markers (minimum of four reads, maximum 50% missing rate). Best predictions were provided by Bayesian Lasso (BL) or ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (rrBLUP), rather than support vector regression (SVR) models, with at least 400-500 markers. Intrapopulation GS predictive ability exceeded 0.5 for yield and onset of flowering in all populations and approached 0.4 for the adjusted yield of a population with high trait variation. Genomic selection was preferable to phenotypic selection in terms of predicted yield gains. Interpopulation GS predictive ability varied largely depending on the pair of populations. GWAS revealed extensive colocalization of markers associated with high yield and early flowering and suggested that they are concentrated in a few genomic regions.",2017,The plant genome
"Factors Associated with Vitamin D Testing, Deficiency, Intake, and Supplementation in Patients with Chronic Pain.","Vitamin D deficiency is a public health issue, with reports of six- to twenty-five-fold rise in vitamin D testing. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to many chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, depression, and chronic pain. Identifying factors associated with risk of deficiency in individuals with chronic pain will help minimize time and cost. This study aims to examine the factors associated with vitamin D testing, intake, and physician-advised supplementation in individuals with chronic pain. Using a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 465 individuals with chronic pain. These data were analyzed using penalized logistic regression with the LASSO technique. Fifty-seven percent reported being tested for vitamin D, about 40% reported being diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency, and of those who had been tested, 60% reported taking vitamin D supplementation. The findings suggest older age (OR 3.12, CI [1.02, 9.50]) and higher mean pain intensity score (OR 2.02, CI [1.13, 3.59]) increased an individual's chance of being vitamin D deficient. Unemployment or on leave due to pain (OR 1.79, [CI 1.03, 3.11]), part-time employment (OR 1.86, CI [1.02, 3.39]), and being a resident of Australia (OR 2.32, CI [1.13, 4.72]) increased chances of being tested for vitamin D. Being diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency (OR 6.67, CI [2.75, 16.19]), unemployed or on leave due to pain (OR 3.71, CI [1.25, 11.00]), and in part-time employment (OR 2.69, CI [0.86, 8.38]) were associated with physician-advised vitamin D supplementation. Our results may have practical implications, as identifying pretest risk factors may assist in identifying who is at risk of vitamin D deficiency, whom to test, and when to treat.",2018,Journal of dietary supplements
SÃ©lection de groupes de variables corrÃ©lÃ©es en grande dimension,"Le contexte de cette these est la selection de variables en grande dimension a l'aide de procedures de regression regularisee en presence de redondance entre variables explicatives. Parmi les variables candidates, on suppose que seul un petit nombre est reellement pertinent pour expliquer la reponse. Dans ce cadre de grande dimension, les approches classiques de type Lasso voient leurs performances se degrader lorsque la redondance croit, puisqu'elles ne tiennent pas compte de cette derniere.

Predicting Outcomes in Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Treated With Standard of Care,"In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), predictive modeling may contribute to targeted drug development by enrichment of the study populations enrolled in clinical trials of DLBCL investigational drugs to include patients with lower likelihood of responding to standard of care. In clinical practice, predictive modeling has the potential to optimize therapy choices in DLBCL. The objectives of this study were to create a model for predicting health outcomes in patients with DLBCL treated with standard of care and determine informative predictors of health outcomes for patients with DLBCL. This was a retrospective observational study using data extracted from the IMS Health Database between September 2007 and April 2015. Patients were â©¾18â€‰years of age with a DLBCL diagnosis. The index date was the date of the first DLBCL diagnosis. Patients were followed until outcome occurrence, defined as progression to a later line of therapy after â©¾60â€‰days from the end of a previous therapy or stem cell transplantation. Patients were categorized into three cohorts depending on the post-index observation period: â©½1â€‰year, â©½3â€‰years, or â©½5â€‰years. Lasso logistic regression (LASSO), Naive Bayes, gradient-boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), and neural network models were performed for each cohort. The best-performing algorithms were predictive models based on GBM and observation periods â©½1 and â©½3â€‰years after index date. Informative predictors included myocardial imaging, DLBCL stage IV, bronchiolar and renal disease, a chemotherapy regimen, and exposure to diphenhydramine and vasoprotectives on or before the first DLBCL diagnosis. These predictive models may be applied to targeted drug development and have the potential to optimize therapy choices in DLBCL. They were generated efficiently using a large number of independent variables readily available in standard insurance claims or electronic health record data systems.",2019,Cancer Informatics
A Multi-way Multi-task Learning Approach for Multinomial Logistic Regression*. An Application in Joint Prediction of Appointment Miss-opportunities across Multiple Clinics.,"OBJECTIVES
Whether they have been engineered for it or not, most healthcare systems experience a variety of unexpected events such as appointment miss-opportunities that can have significant impact on their revenue, cost and resource utilization. In this paper, a multi-way multi-task learning model based on multinomial logistic regression is proposed to jointly predict the occurrence of different types of miss-opportunities at multiple clinics.


METHODS
An extension of L1â€Š/â€ŠL2 regularization is proposed to enable transfer of information among various types of miss-opportunities as well as different clinics. A proximal algorithm is developed to transform the convex but non-smooth likelihood function of the multi-way multi-task learning model into a convex and smooth optimization problem solvable using gradient descent algorithm.


RESULTS
A dataset of real attendance records of patients at four different clinics of a VA medical center is used to verify the performance of the proposed multi-task learning approach. Additionally, a simulation study, investigating more general data situations is provided to highlight the specific aspects of the proposed approach. Various individual and integrated multinomial logistic regression models with/without LASSO penalty along with a number of other common classification algorithms are fitted and compared against the proposed multi-way multi-task learning approach. Fivefold cross validationÂ is used to estimate comparing models parameters and their predictive accuracy. The multi-way multi-task learning framework enables the proposed approach to achieve aÂ considerable rate of parameter shrinkage and superior prediction accuracy across various types of miss-opportunities and clinics.


CONCLUSIONS
The proposed approach provides an integrated structure to effectively transfer knowledge among different miss-opportunities and clinics to reduce model size, increase estimation efficacy, and more importantly improve predictions results. The proposed framework can be effectively applied to medical centers with multiple clinics, especially those suffering from information scarcity on some type of disruptions and/or clinics.",2017,Methods of information in medicine
Regularizing the Factor Zoo with OWL : A Correlation-Robust Machine Learning Approach âˆ—,"This paper sheds light on a new perspective of the â€œfactor zoo enigmaâ€, in which factor correlation prevails and worsens the â€œcurse of dimensionalityâ€. I introduce a newly developed machine learning tool, OWL, which circumvents complications from correlations in high dimensionality: it can identify and group correlated factors while shrinking off useless/redundant ones. I show that OWL estimator is consistent and I derive the grouping condition for correlated factors. Monte Carlo experiments show that OWL outperforms LASSO, adaptive LASSO and Elastic Net (EN) in various settings, particularly when factors are highly correlated. Empirical evidence suggests that liquidity related factors are primary to drive asset prices but cautions about a time-varying nature in factor selections. Out-of-sample analysis confirms superior performance of OWL hedged portfolios compared with LASSO, EN and Fama-MacBeth regression. JEL classification: C33 C52 C58 G12",2019,

Modeling and Prediction of Time Series of Directed Binary Networks,"Over the last few years modeling of temporal evolution of network data has become a relevant problem for different applications. In this work, we develop novel statistical methods for modeling time series of directed binary networks. The main interests are identifying events associated with structural changes over time and perform short-term link prediction of the network in future periods.First, we introduce a Bayesian hidden Markov model that uses a stochastic blockmodel to describe the community structure of the network during each period. This model allow us to monitor structural changes in the network and also perform accurate short-term predictions of future links. As an alternative for link prediction, we propose two multinomial logistic regression models using different lasso type penalties including an extension of the autologistic model for network data. In this setting, we are able to provide fast computational algorithms for estimation and prediction using optimization and full Bayesian inference. The performance of the models is illustrated using both simulated and real data from a financial trading network in the NYMEX natural gas futures market.",2015,
A Moving-window penalization method and its applications,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has played an import role in identifying genetic variants underlying human complex traits. However, its success is hindered by weak effect at causal variants and noise at non-causal variants. Penalized regression can be applied to handle GWAS problems. GWAS data has some specificities. Consecutive genetic markers are usually highly correlated due to linkage disequilibrium. This thesis introduces a moving-window penalized method for GWAS which smooths the effects of consecutive SNPs. Simulation studies indicate that this penalized moving window method provides improved true positive findings. The practical utility of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 Rheumatoid Arthritis data. Next, the moving-window penalty is applied on generalized linear model. We call such an approach as smoothed lasso (SLasso). Coordinate descent computing algorithms are proposed in details, for both quadratic and logistic loss. Asymptotic properties are discussed. Then based on SLasso, we discuss a two-stage method called MW-Ridge. Simulation results show that while SLasso can provide more true positive findings than Lasso, it has a side-effect that it includes more unrelated random noises. MW-Ridge can eliminate such a side-effect and result in high true positive rates and low false detective rates. The applicability to real data is illustrated by using GAW 16 Rheumatoid Arthritis data.",2017,
Penalized regression techniques for prediction: a case study for predicting tree mortality using remotely sensed vegetation indices,"Constructing models can be complicated when the available fitting data are highly correlated and of high dimension. However, the complications depend on whether the goal is prediction instead of estimation. We focus on predicting tree mortality (measured as the number of dead trees) from change metrics derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite images. The high dimensionality and multicollinearity inherent in such data are of particular concern. Standard regression techniques perform poorly for such data, so we examine shrinkage regression techniques such as ridge regression, the LASSO, and partial least squares, which yield more robust predictions. We also suggest efficient strategies that can be used to select optimal models such as 0.632+ bootstrap and generalized cross validation. The techniques are compared using simulations. The techniques are then used to predict insect-induced tree mortality severity for a Pinus radiata D. Don plantation in southern New South Wales, Austr...",2011,Canadian Journal of Forest Research
Development of Regression Model Using Lasso And Optimisation of Process Parameters in Metal Spinning,"Metal Spinning is a concept of describing the forming of metal into seamless, axisymmetric shapes by a combination of rotational motion and force. Sheet metal spinning is one of the metal forming processes, which a flat metal blank is rotated at a high speed and formed into an axisymmetric part by a roller which gradually forces the blank on to a mandrel, bearing the final shape of the spun part. Over the last few decades, sheet metal spinning has developed significantly and spun products have been used in various industries. Nowadays the process has been expanded to new horizons in industries, since tendency to use minimum tool and equipment costs and also using lower forces with the output of excellent surface quality and good mechanical properties. The automation of the process is of greater importance, due to its wider applications like decorative householdâ€Ÿs goods, rocket nose cones, gas cylinders etc. The objective of the current work is to develop the mathematical model for the spinning process with surface roughness as response and the input parameters as Mandrel speed (rpm), geometry of the Roller and Thickness of sheet (mm). Type of mandrel (EN8 Material) considered in the spinning process has the geometrical profile of parabola and single roller and double roller tools (EN8 Material) are used to deform the Al2024-T3 sheet metal paper aims to understand the process parameters that affect the surface finish of the spun component. Full factorial Design of Experiments technique is used to find the minimum number of experimental trials that are required to develop the regression model. A regression model using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) is developed to further deepen the understanding between the input parameters and the surface roughness. The model was optimised using Sequential Quadratic Programming.",2017,
Catching Growth Determinants with the Adaptive Lasso,"Abstract This paper uses the adaptive Lasso estimator to determine variables important for economic growth. The adaptive Lasso estimator is a computationally very efficient procedure that simultaneously performs model selection and parameter estimation. The computational cost of this method is negligibly small compared with standard approaches in the growth regressions literature. We apply this method for a regional dataset for the European Union covering the 255 NUTS2 regions in the 27 member states over the period 1995-2005. The results suggest that initial GDP per capita (with an implied convergence speed of about 1.5% per annum), human capital ( proxied by the shares of highly and medium educated in the working age population), structural labor market characteristics (the initial unemployment rate and the initial activity rate of the low educated) as well as being a capital region are important for economic growth.",2008,German Economic Review

Shrinkage and penalized estimators in weighted least absolute deviations regression models,"ABSTRACT In this paper, we consider the estimation problem of the weighted least absolute deviation (WLAD) regression parameter vector when there are some outliers or heavy-tailed errors in the response and the leverage points in the predictors. We propose the pretest and Jamesâ€“Stein shrinkage WLAD estimators when some of the parameters may be subject to certain restrictions. We derive the asymptotic risk of the pretest and shrinkage WLAD estimators and show that if the shrinkage dimension exceeds two, the asymptotic risk of the shrinkage WLAD estimator is strictly less than the unrestricted WLAD estimator. On the other hand, the risk of the pretest WLAD estimator depends on the validity of the restrictions on the parameters. Furthermore, we study the WLAD absolute shrinkage and selection operator (WLAD-LASSO) and compare its relative performance with the pretest and shrinkage WLAD estimators. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators relative to that of the unrestricted WLAD estimator. A real-life data example using body fat study is used to illustrate the performance of the suggested estimators.",2018,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
Radiomics analysis of multiparametric MRI for prediction of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer,"ObjectivesTo develop and validate a radiomics predictive model based on pre-treatment multiparameter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and clinical features to predict a pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) after receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT).MethodsOne hundred and eighty-six consecutive patients with LARC (training dataset, n = 131; validation dataset, n = 55) were enrolled in our retrospective study. A total of 1,188 imaging features were extracted from pre-CRT T2-weighted (T2-w), contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (cT1-w) and ADC images for each patient. Three steps including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were performed to select key features and build a radiomics signature. Combining clinical risk factors, a radiomics nomogram was constructed. The predictive performance was evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and then assessed with respect to its calibration, discrimination and clinical usefulness.ResultsThirty-one of 186 patients (16.7%) achieved pCR. The radiomics signature derived from joint T2-w, ADC, and cT1-w images, comprising 12 selected features, was significantly associated with pCR status and showed better predictive performance than signatures derived from either of them alone in both datasets. The radiomics nomogram, incorporating the radiomics signature and MR-reported T-stages, also showed good discrimination, with areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) of 0.948 (95% CI, 0.907-0.989) and 0.966 (95% CI, 0.924-1.000), as well as good calibration in both datasets. Decision curve analysis confirmed its clinical usefulness.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that the pre-treatment radiomics nomogram can predict pCR in patients with LARC and potentially guide treatments to select patients for a â€œwait-and-seeâ€ policy.Key Pointsâ€¢ Radiomics analysis of pre-CRT multiparameter MR images could predict pCR in patients with LARC.â€¢ Proposed radiomics signature from joint T2-w, ADC and cT1-w images showed better predictive performance than individual signatures.â€¢ Most of the clinical characteristics were unable to predict pCR.",2018,European Radiology
Noninvasive prediction of lymph node status for patients with early-stage cervical cancer based on radiomics features from ultrasound images,"To investigate the feasibility of a noninvasive detection of lymph node metastasis (LNM) for early-stage cervical cancer (ECC) patients with radiomics methods based on the textural features from ultrasound images. One hundred seventy-two ECC patients between January 2014 and September 2018 with pathologically confirmed lymph node status (LNS) and preoperative ultrasound images were retrospectively reviewed. Regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated by a senior radiologist in the ultrasound images. LIFEx was applied to extract textural features for radiomics study. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was applied for dimension reduction and for selection of key features. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was adopted to build the radiomics signature. The Mannâ€“Whitney U test was applied to investigate the correlation between radiomics and LNS for both training and validation cohorts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the accuracy of the radiomics prediction models. A total of 152 radiomics features were extracted from ultrasound images, in which 6 features were significantly associated with LNS (p <â€‰0.05). The radiomics signatures demonstrated a good discrimination between patients with LNM and non-LNM groups. The best radiomics performance model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71â€“0.88) in the training cohort and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65â€“0.88) in the validation cohort. The feasibility of radiomics features from ultrasound images for the prediction of LNM in ECC was investigated. This noninvasive prediction method may be used to facilitate preoperative identification of LNS in patients with ECC. â€¢ Few studied had investigated the feasibility of radiomics based on ultrasound images for cervical cancer, even though it is the most common practice for gynecological cancer diagnosis and treatment. â€¢ The radiomics signatures based on ultrasound images demonstrated a good discrimination between patients with and without lymph node metastasis with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 and 0.77 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. â€¢ The radiomics model based on preoperative ultrasound images has the potential ability to predict lymph node status noninvasively in patients with early-state cervical cancer, so as to reduce the impact of invasive examination and to optimize the treatment choices.",2020,European Radiology
Abstract # 3143 Inflammatory markers in postpartum depression â€“ a sign of an exaggerated stress response?,"Compared with major depressive disorder, postpartum depression and its relation to immune activation and inflammation is less studied. Postpartum, after vast adaptations of the immune system during pregnancy, the immune system needs to return to a non-pregnant state, during a period of immune challenging events, such as wound healing, sleep loss, and a fall in levels of proteins and hormones. The study aim was to investigate potential differences in peripheral levels of immune related biomarkers in women with and without postpartum depression (nâ€¯=â€¯62 and 107 respectively). Among the 71 markers analyzed with multiplex proximity extension assay, five were significantly elevated in women with postpartum depressive symptoms in the adjusted LASSO logistic regression analysis, including TRANCE (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.20), HGF (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.17), IL-18 (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.06), FGF-23 (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.25), and CXCL1 (OR 1.11). Previously, HGF, IL-18 as well as FGF-23 have been reported lower in severe forms of depression while high levels of IL-18 and CXCL1 have been associated to stress responses. The delivery triggers stress-induced immune responses. Our results might be due to an elevated response to stress as immune reactions previously has been associated with exaggerated inflammation in women with depressive symptoms. Future research should evaluate the relevance of the identified markers, in combination with other known risk factors for postpartum depression. .",2019,"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity"
