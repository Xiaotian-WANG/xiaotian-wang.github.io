Machine learning-based prediction of response to PARP inhibition across cancer types.,"PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are FDA approved for the treatment of BRCA1/2 deficient breast and ovarian cancer, but a growing body of pre-clinical evidence suggests the drug class holds therapeutic potential in other cancer types, independent of BRCA1/2 status. Large-scale pharmacogenomic datasets offer the opportunity to develop predictors of response to PARPis in many cancer types, expanding their potential clinical applicability. Response to the PARPi olaparib was used to identify a multi-gene PARPi response signature in a large in vitro dataset including multiple cancer types, such as breast, ovarian, pancreatic, lung cancer, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, using machine learning approaches. The signature was validated on multiple independent in vitro datasets, also testing for response to another PARPi, rucaparib, as well as two clinical datasets using the cisplatin response as a surrogate for PARPi response. Finally, integrative pharmacogenomic analysis was performed to identify drugs which may be effective in PARPi resistant tumors. A PARPi response signature was defined as the 50 most differentially transcribed genes between PARPi resistant and sensitive cell lines from several different cancer types. Cross validated predictors generated with LASSO logistic regression using the PARPi signature genes accurately predicted PARPi response in a training set of olaparib treated cell lines (80-89%), an independent olaparib treated in vitro dataset (66-77%), and an independent rucaparib treated in vitro dataset (80-87%). The PARPi signature also significantly predicted in vitro breast cancer response to olaparib in another separate experimental dataset. The signature also predicted clinical response to cisplatin and survival in human ovarian cancer and osteosarcoma datasets. Robust transcriptional differences between PARPi sensitive and resistant tumors accurately predict PARPi response in vitro and cisplatin response in vivo for multiple tumor types with or without known BRCA1/2 deficiency. These signatures may prove useful for predicting response in patients treated with PARP inhibitors.",2019,medRxiv
Urate and Nonanoate Mark the Relationship between Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Intake and Blood Pressure in Adolescent Girls: A Metabolomics Analysis in the ELEMENT Cohort,"We sought to identify metabolites that mark the relationship of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake with adiposity and metabolic risk among boys (n = 114) and girls (n = 128) aged 8-14 years. We conducted the analysis in three steps: (1) linear regression to examine associations of SSB intake (quartiles) with adiposity, glycemia, lipids, and blood pressure (BP); (2) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to identify SSB-associated metabolites from an untargeted dataset of 938 metabolites; and (3) linear regression to determine whether SSB-related metabolites are also associated with adiposity and metabolic risk. In girls, SSB intake was associated with marginally higher BP (Q2 vs, Q1: 1.11 [-3.90, 6.13], Q3 vs. Q1: 1.16 [-3.81, 6.13], Q4 vs. Q1: 4.65 [-0.22, 9.53] mmHg systolic blood pressure (SBP); P-trend = 0.07). In boys, SSB intake corresponded with higher C-peptide insulin resistance (Q2 vs. Q1: 0.06 [-0.06, 0.19], Q3 vs. Q1: 0.01 [-0.12, 0.14], Q4 vs. Q1: 0.17 [0.04, 0.30] ng/mL; P-trend = 0.03) and leptin (P-trend = 0.02). LASSO identified 6 annotated metabolites in girls (5-methyl-tetrohydrofolate, phenylephrine, urate, nonanoate, deoxyuridine, sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and 3 annotated metabolites in boys (2-piperidinone, octanoylcarnitine, catechol) associated with SSB intake. Among girls, urate and nonanoate marked the relationship of SSB intake with BP. None of the SSB-associated metabolites were related to health outcomes in boys.",2019,Metabolites
"Multi-modality neuroimaging brain-age in UK Biobank: relationship to biomedical, lifestyle and cognitive factors","The brain-age paradigm is proving increasingly useful for exploring ageing-related disease and can predict important future health outcomes. Most brain-age research utilises structural neuroimaging to index brain volume. However, ageing affects multiple aspects of brain structure and function, which can be examined using multi-modality neuroimaging. Using UK Biobank, brain-age was modelled in n=2,205 healthy people with T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, T2*, diffusion-MRI, task fMRI and resting-state fMRI. In a held-out healthy validation set (n=520), chronological age was accurately predicted (r=0.79, mean absolute error=3.52 years) using LASSO regression, higher than using any modality separately. Thirty-four neuroimaging phenotypes were deemed informative by the regression (after bootstrapping); predominantly grey-matter volume and white-matter microstructure measures. When applied to new individuals from UK Biobank (n=14,701), significant associations with multi-modality brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) were found for: stroke history, diabetes diagnosis, smoking, alcohol intake and some, but not all, cognitive measures (corrected p<0.05). Multi-modality neuroimaging can improve brain-age prediction, and derived brain-PAD values are sensitive to biomedical and lifestyle factors that negatively impact brain and cognitive health.",2019,bioRxiv
On the $\ell_1-\ell_q$ Regularized Regression,"In this paper we consider the problem of grouped variable selection in high-dimensional regression using $\ell_1-\ell_q$ regularization ($1\leq q \leq \infty$), which can be viewed as a natural generalization of the $\ell_1-\ell_2$ regularization (the group Lasso). The key condition is that the dimensionality $p_n$ can increase much faster than the sample size $n$, i.e. $p_n \gg n$ (in our case $p_n$ is the number of groups), but the number of relevant groups is small. The main conclusion is that many good properties from $\ell_1-$regularization (Lasso) naturally carry on to the $\ell_1-\ell_q$ cases ($1 \leq q \leq \infty$), even if the number of variables within each group also increases with the sample size. With fixed design, we show that the whole family of estimators are both estimation consistent and variable selection consistent under different conditions. We also show the persistency result with random design under a much weaker condition. These results provide a unified treatment for the whole family of estimators ranging from $q=1$ (Lasso) to $q=\infty$ (iCAP), with $q=2$ (group Lasso)as a special case. When there is no group structure available, all the analysis reduces to the current results of the Lasso estimator ($q=1$).",2008,arXiv: Machine Learning
An E-cient Proximal Gradient Method for General Structured Sparse Learning,"We study the problem of learning high dimensional regression models regularized by a structured-sparsity-inducing penalty that encodes prior structural information on either input or output sides. We consider two widely adopted types of such penalties as our motivating examples: 1) overlapping-group-lasso penalty, based on â€˜1=â€˜2 mixed-norm, and 2) graph-guided fusion penalty. For both types of penalties, due to their non-separability, developing an eâ€cient optimization method has remained a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a general optimization framework, called proximal gradient method, which can solve the structured sparse learning problems with a smooth convex loss and a wide spectrum of non-smooth and non-separable structured-sparsity-inducing penalties, including the overlapping-group-lasso and graph-guided fusion penalties. Our method exploits the structure of such penalties, decouples the non-separable penalty function via the dual norm, introduces its smooth approximation, and solves this approximation function. It achieves a convergence rate signiflcantly faster than the standard flrst-order method, subgradient method, and is much more scalable than the most widely used method, namely interior-point method for second-order cone programming and quadratic programming formulations. The eâ€ciency and scalability of our method are demonstrated on both simulated and real genetic datasets.",2010,
Variable Selection for BART: An Application to Gene Regulation,"We consider the task of discovering gene regulatory networks, which are defined as sets of genes and the corresponding transcription factors which regulate their expression levels. This can be viewed as a variable selection problem, potentially with high dimensionality. Variable selection is especially challenging in high-dimensional settings, where it is difficult to detect subtle individual effects and interactions between predictors. Bayesian Additive Regression Trees [BART, Ann. Appl. Stat. 4 (2010) 266â€298] provides a novel nonparametric alternative to parametric regression approaches, such as the lasso or stepwise regression, especially when the number of relevant predictors is sparse relative to the total number of available predictors and the fundamental relationships are nonlinear. We develop a principled permutation-based inferential approach for determining when the effect of a selected predictor is likely to be real. Going further, we adapt the BART procedure to incorporate informed prior information about variable importance. We present simulations demonstrating that our method compares favorably to existing parametric and nonparametric procedures in a variety of data settings. To demonstrate the potential of our approach in a biological context, we apply it to the task of inferring the gene regulatory network in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We find that our BART-based procedure is best able to recover the subset of covariates with the largest signal compared to other variable selection methods. The methods developed in this work are readily available in the R package bartMachine.",2014,The Annals of Applied Statistics
The clinical consequences of variable selection in multiple regression models: a case study of the Norwegian Opioid Maintenance Treatment program.,"Background: Selecting which variables to include in multiple regression models is a pervasive problem in medical research. Objectives: Based on questionnaire data (nÂ =Â 18538, 69.9% men) from the Norwegian Opioid Maintenance Treatment Program, this study aims to compare the performance of different variable selection methods and the potential clinical consequences of choice of method. The effect of missing data is also explored. Methods: The dependent variable was engagement in criminal behavior while in treatment. Twenty-nine potential covariates on demographics, psychosocial factors and drug use were tested for inclusion in a multiple logistic regression model. Both complete case and multiply imputed data were considered. We compared the results from variable selection methods ranging from expert-based and purposeful variable selection, through stepwise methods, to more recently developed penalized regression using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Results: The various variable selection methods resulted in regression models including from 9 to 22 covariates. The stepwise selection procedures generated the models with the most covariates included. The choice of variable selection method directly affected the estimated regression coefficients, both in effect size and statistical significance. For several variables the expert-based approach disagreed with all data-driven methods. Conclusions: The choice of variable selection method may strongly affect the resulting regression model, along with accompanying effect sizes and confidence intervals. This may affectÂ clinical conclusions. The process should consequently be given sufficient consideration in model building. We recommend combining expert knowledge with a data-driven variable selection method to explore the models' robustness.",2019,The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse
Institute of Statistics Mimeo Series No . 2579 Adaptive-LASSO for Cox â€™ s Proportional Hazards Model,"We investigate the variable selection problem for Coxâ€™s proportional hazards model, and propose a unified model selection and estimation procedure with desired theoretical properties and computational convenience. The new method is based on a penalized log partial likelihood with the adaptively weighted L1 penalty on regression coefficients, providing what we call the adaptive Lasso estimator. The method incorporates different penalties for different coefficients: unimportant variables receive larger penalties than important ones, so that important variables tend to be retained in the selection process, whereas unimportant variables are more likely to be dropped. Theoretical properties, such as consistency and rate of convergence of the estimator, are studied. We also show that, with proper choice of regularization parameters, the proposed estimator has the oracle properties. The convex optimization nature of the method leads to an efficient algorithm. Both simulated and real examples show that the method performs competitively.",2006,
Adverse drug reaction or innocent bystander? A systematic comparison of statistical discovery methods for spontaneous reporting systems.,"PURPOSE
Spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) are used to discover previously unknown relationships between drugs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A plethora of statistical methods have been proposed over the years to identify these drug-ADR pairs. The objective of this study is to compare a wide variety of methods in their ability to detect these signals, especially when their detection is complicated by the presence of innocent bystanders (drugs that are mistaken to be associated with the ADR, since they are prescribed together with the drug that is the ADR's actual cause).


METHODS
Twelve methods, 24 measures in total, ranging from simple disproportionality measures (eg, the reporting odds ratio), hypothesis tests (eg, test of the Poisson mean), Bayesian shrinkage estimates (eg, the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, BCPNN) to sparse regression (LASSO), are compared in their ability to detect drug-ADR pairs in a large number of simulated SRSs with varying numbers of innocent bystanders and effect sizes. The area under the precision-recall curve is used to assess the measures' performance.


RESULTS
Hypothesis tests (especially the test of the Poisson mean) perform best when the associations are weak and there is little to no confounding by other drugs. When the level of confounding increases and/or the effect sizes become larger, Bayesian shrinkage methods should be preferred. The LASSO proves to be the most robust against the innocent bystander effect.


CONCLUSIONS
There is no absolute ""winner"". Which method to use for a particular SRS depends on the effect sizes and the level of confounding present in the data.",2020,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety
Stochastic model search with binary outcomes for genome-wide association studies,"OBJECTIVE
The spread of case-control genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has stimulated the development of new variable selection methods and predictive models. We introduce a novel Bayesian model search algorithm, Binary Outcome Stochastic Search (BOSS), which addresses the model selection problem when the number of predictors far exceeds the number of binary responses.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our method is based on a latent variable model that links the observed outcomes to the underlying genetic variables. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach is used for model search and to evaluate the posterior probability of each predictor.


RESULTS
BOSS is compared with three established methods (stepwise regression, logistic lasso, and elastic net) in a simulated benchmark. Two real case studies are also investigated: a GWAS on the genetic bases of longevity, and the type 2 diabetes study from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Simulations show that BOSS achieves higher precisions than the reference methods while preserving good recall rates. In both experimental studies, BOSS successfully detects genetic polymorphisms previously reported to be associated with the analyzed phenotypes.


DISCUSSION
BOSS outperforms the other methods in terms of F-measure on simulated data. In the two real studies, BOSS successfully detects biologically relevant features, some of which are missed by univariate analysis and the three reference techniques.


CONCLUSION
The proposed algorithm is an advance in the methodology for model selection with a large number of features. Our simulated and experimental results showed that BOSS proves effective in detecting relevant markers while providing a parsimonious model.",2012,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA
Literature-based genetic risk scores for coronary heart disease: the Cardiovascular Registry Maastricht (CAREMA) prospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk factors (RF). Using a case-cohort study within the prospective Cardiovascular Registry Maastricht (CAREMA) cohort, we tested if genetic risk scores (GRS) based on GWAS-identified SNPs are associated with and predictive for future CHD.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Incident cases (n=742), that is, participants who developed CHD during a median follow-up of 12.1 years (range, 0.0-16.9 years), were compared with a randomly selected subcohort of 2221 participants selected from the total cohort (n=21 148). We genotyped 179 SNPs previously associated with CHD or CHD RF in GWAS as published up to May 2, 2011. The allele-count GRS, composed of all SNPs, the 153 RF SNPs, or the 29 CHD SNPs were not associated with CHD independent of CHD RF. The weighted 29 CHD SNP GRS, with weights obtained from GWAS for every SNP, were associated with CHD independent of CHD RF (hazard ratio, 1.12 per weighted risk allele; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.21) and improved risk reclassification with 2.8% (P=0.031). As an exploratory approach to achieve weighting, we performed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis on all SNPs and the CHD SNPs. The CHD LASSO GRS performed equal to the weighted CHD GRS, whereas the Overall LASSO GRS performed slightly better than the weighted CHD GRS.


CONCLUSIONS
A GRS composed of CHD SNPs improves risk prediction when adjusted for the effect sizes of the SNPs. Alternatively LASSO regression analysis may be used to achieve weighting; however, validation in independent populations is required.",2012,Circulation. Cardiovascular genetics
Using LASSO in gene co-expression network for genome-wide identification of gene interactions responding to salt stress in rice,"In many applications, such as gene co-expression network analyses, data arises with a huge number of covariates while the size of sample is comparatively small. To improve the accuracy of prediction, variable selection is often used to get a sparse solution by forcing coefficients of variables contributing less to the observed response variable to zero. Various algorithms were developed for variable selection, but LASSO is well known for its statistical accuracy, computational feasibility and broad applicability to adaptation. In this project, we applied LASSO to the gene co-expression network of rice with salt stress to discover key gene interactions for salt-tolerance related phenotypes. The dataset we have is a high-dimensional one, having 50K genes from 100 samples, with the issue of multicollinearity for fitting linear regression - the expression level of genes in the same pathway tends to be highly correlated. The property of LASSO with sparse parameters is naturally suitable to identify gene interactions of interest in this dataset. After biologically functional modules in the co-expression network was identified, the major changed expression patterns were further selected by LASSO regression to establish a linear relationship between gene expression profiles and physiological responses, such as sodium/potassium condenses, with salt stress. Five modules of intensively co-expressed genes, from 45 to 291 genes, were identified by our method with significant P-values, which indicate these modules are significantly associated with physiological responses to stress. Genes in these modules have functions related to ion transport, osmotic adjustment, and oxidative tolerance. For example, LOC_Os7g47350 and LOC_Os07g37320 are co-expressed gene in the same module 15. Both are ion transporter genes and have higher gene expression levels for rice with low sodium levels with salt stress.",2018,bioRxiv
Split Regularized Regression,"We propose an approach for fitting linear regression models that splits the set of covariates into groups. The optimal split of the variables into groups and the regularized estimation of the regression coefficients are performed by minimizing an objective function that encourages sparsity within each group and diversity among them. The estimated coefficients are then pooled together to form the final fit. Our procedure works on top of a given penalized linear regression estimator (e.g., Lasso, elastic net) by fitting it to possibly overlapping groups of features, encouraging diversity among these groups to reduce the correlation of the corresponding predictions. For the case of two groups, elastic net penalty and orthogonal predictors, we give a closed form solution for the regression coefficients in each group. We establish the consistency of our method with the number of predictors possibly increasing with the sample size. An extensive simulation study and real-data applications show that in general the proposed method improves the prediction accuracy of the base estimator used in the procedure. Possible extensions to GLMs and other models are discussed. The supplemental material for this article, available online, contains the proofs of our theoretical results and the full results of our simulation study.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Statistical methods for predicting mortality in patients diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES
Risk stratification in pulmonary embolism (PE) guides patient management. The purpose of this study was to develop and test novel mortality risk prediction models for subjects with acute PE diagnosed using computed tomographic pulmonary angiography in a large cohort with comprehensive clinical data.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Retrospective analyses of 1596 consecutive subjects diagnosed with acute PE from a single, large, urban teaching hospital included two modern statistical methods to predict survival in patients with acute PE. Landmark analysis was used for 90-day mortality. Adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (aLASSO), a penalization method, was used to select variables important for prediction and to estimate model coefficients. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the resulting prediction rules.


RESULTS
Using 30-day all-cause mortality outcome, three of the 16 clinical risk factors (the presence of a known malignancy, coronary artery disease, and increased age) were associated with high risk, while subjects treated with anticoagulation had lower risk. For 90-day landmark mortality, subjects with recent operations had a lower risk for death. Both prediction rules developed using aLASSO performed well compared to standard logistic regression.


CONCLUSIONS
The aLASSO regression approach combined with landmark analysis provides a novel tool for large patient populations and can be applied for clinical risk stratification among subjects diagnosed with acute PE. After positive results on computed tomographic pulmonary angiography, the presence of a known malignancy, coronary artery disease, and advanced age increase 30-day mortality. Additional risk stratification can be simplified with these methods, and future work will place imaging-based prediction of mortality in perspective with other clinical data.",2012,Academic radiology
Transfer learning with deep convolutional neural network for liver steatosis assessment in ultrasound images,"PurposeThe nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common liver abnormality. Up to date, liver biopsy is the reference standard for direct liver steatosis quantification in hepatic tissue samples. In this paper we propose a neural network-based approach for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease assessment in ultrasound.MethodsWe used the Inception-ResNet-v2 deep convolutional neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to extract high-level features in liver B-mode ultrasound image sequences. The steatosis level of each liver was graded by wedge biopsy. The proposed approach was compared with the hepatorenal index technique and the gray-level co-occurrence matrix algorithm. After the feature extraction, we applied the support vector machine algorithm to classify images containing fatty liver. Based on liver biopsy, the fatty liver was defined to have more than 5% of hepatocytes with steatosis. Next, we used the features and the Lasso regression method to assess the steatosis level.ResultsThe area under the receiver operating characteristics curve obtained using the proposed approach was equal to 0.977, being higher than the one obtained with the hepatorenal index method, 0.959, and much higher than in the case of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix algorithm, 0.893. For regression the Spearman correlation coefficients between the steatosis level and the proposed approach, the hepatorenal index and the gray-level co-occurrence matrix algorithm were equal to 0.78, 0.80 and 0.39, respectively.ConclusionsThe proposed approach may help the sonographers automatically diagnose the amount of fat in the liver. The presented approach is efficient and in comparison with other methods does not require the sonographers to select the region of interest.",2018,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery
Whole brain apparent diffusion coefficient measurements correlate with survival in glioblastoma patients,"IntroductionGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, and methods to improve the early detection of disease progression and evaluate treatment response are highly desirable. We therefore explored changes in whole-brain apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values with respect to survival (progression-free [PFS], overall [OS]) in a cohort of GBM patients followed at regular intervals until disease progression.MethodsA total of 43 subjects met inclusion criteria and were analyzed retrospectively. Histogram data were extracted from standardized whole-brain ADC maps including skewness, kurtosis, entropy, median, mode, 15th percentile (p15) and 85th percentile (p85) values, and linear regression slopes (metrics versus time) were fitted. Regression slope directionality (positive/negative) was subjected to univariate Cox regression. The final model was determined by aLASSO on metrics above threshold.ResultsSkewness, kurtosis, median, p15 and p85 were all below threshold for both PFS and OS and were analyzed further. Median regression slope directionality best modeled PFS (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001; HR 3.3; 95% CI 1.6â€“6.7), while p85 was selected for OS (pâ€‰=â€‰0.002; HR 0.29; 95% CI 0.13â€“0.64).ConclusionsOur data show tantalizing potential in the use of whole-brain ADC measurements in the follow up of GBM patients, specifically serial median ADC values which correlated with PFS, and serial p85 values which correlated with OS. Whole-brain ADC measurements are fast and easy to perform, and free of ROI-placement bias.",2019,Journal of Neuro-Oncology
Development and validation of lncRNAs-based nomogram for prediction of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer by bioinformatics analysis,"Background: Early biochemical recurrence (BCR) was considered as a sign for clinical recurrence and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa). The purpose of the present study was to identify a lncRNA-based nomogram that can predict BCR of PCa accurately. Materials and methods: Bioinformatics analysis, such as propensity score matching (PSM) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analyses were used to identify candidate lncRNAs for further bioinformatics analysis. LASSO Cox regression model was used to select the most significant prognostic lncRNAs and construct the lncRNAs signature for predicting BCR in discovery set. Additionally, a nomogram based on our lncRNAs signature was also formulated. Both lncRNAs signature and nomogram were validated in test set. GSEA was carried out to identify various gene sets which share a common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. Results: A total of 457 patients with sufficient BCR information were included in our analysis. Finally, a five lncRNAs signature significantly associated with BCR was identified in discovery set (HR=0.44, 95%CI: 0.27-0.72, C-index = 0.63) and validated in test set (HR=0.22, 95%CI: 0.09-0.56, C-index = 0.65). Additionally, the lncRNAs-based nomogram showed significant performance for predicting BCR in both discovery set (C-index = 0.74) and test set (C-index = 0.78). Conclusion: In conclusion, our lncRNAs-based nomogram is a reliable prognostic tool for BCR in PCa patients. In addition, the present study put forward the direction for the further investigation on the mechanism of PCa progression.",2019,Journal of Cancer
Non-inducibility of AF post electrophysiologically based PV isolation predicts freedom from AF,"Background: Recently, various anatomic and electrophysiologic approaches to pulmonary vein (PV) isolation have shown variable efficacy in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Whether inducibility of AF after achieving prespecified electrophysiologic endpoints of PV isolation is a useful predictor of AF recurrence is unknown. Methods: This study included 105 consecutive patients who underwent PV isolation for the treatment of symptomatic AF and were followed for a mean of 327 days. Patients were 54 /11 years of age, 72% were males, 46% had hypertension, 15% had valvular heart disease (VHD), 10% had cardiomyopathy, 40% had persistent or permanent AF, and 60% were on antiarrhythmic agents. Complete isolation of all 4 PVs was confirmed by demonstration of bi-directional block across the ablation lines: a) loss of PV potentials and b) failure to capture the LA by pacing 10-14 bipolar pairs of electrodes of the Lasso catheter placed at the entrance of the PV at 10 mA. Induction of AF by burst pacing from the HRA and/or CS on/off Isoproterenol (1-10mcg/min) was attempted after PV isolation. AF was inducible in 61% of patients and was sustained ( 1 minute) in 42% of patients. Clinical follow up included assessment of asymptomatic or symptomatic AF by 2 week event recorder and 24 hour holter monitor at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Predictors of freedom from AF recurrence at 6 and 12 months were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Freedom from asymptomatic or symptomatic AF was present in 72% of patients at 6 months and 67% of patients at 12 months. Symptomatic improvement (90% reduction in symptoms) was present in 88% and 87% of patients at 6 and 12 months. In multivariable analysis, freedom from AF at 6 months was predicted by non-inducibility post PV isolation (OR: 5.48, p: 0.05) and absence of VHD (OR: 6.44, p: 0.03). Freedom from AF at 12 months was predicted by non-inducibility post PV isolation (OR: 39.32, p: 0.01), absence of VHD (OR: 8.28, p: 0.04), and absence of hypertension (OR: 10.73, p: 0.03). Conclusion: After complete PV isolation for AF, non-inducibility of AF in the electrophysiology laboratory predicts maintenance of sinus rhythm.",2005,Heart Rhythm
Efficiency and Consistency for Regularization Parameter Selection in Penalized Regression: Asymptotics and Finite-Sample Corrections,"This paper studies the asymptotic and nite-sample performance of penalized regression methods when different selectors of the regularization parameter are used under the assumption that the true model is, or is not, included among the candidate model. In the latter setting, we relax assumptions in the existing theory to show that several classical information criteria are asymptotically efficient selectors of the regularization parameter. In both settings, we assess the nite-sample performance of these as well as other common selectors and demonstrate that their performance can suffer due to sensitivity to the number of variables that are included in the full model. As alternatives, we propose two corrected information criteria which are shown to outperform the existing procedures while still maintaining the desired asymptotic properties. In the non-true model world, we relax the assumption made in the literature that the true error variance is known or that a consistent estimator is available to prove that Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Cp and Generalized cross-validation (GCV) themselves are asymptotically efficient selectors of the regularization parameter and we study their performance in nite samples. In classical regression, AIC tends to select overly complex models when the dimension of the maximum candidate model is large relative to the sample size. Simulation studies suggest that AIC suffers from the same shortcomings when used in penalized regression. We therefore propose the use of the classical AICc as an alternative. In the true model world, a similar investigation into the nite sample properties of BIC reveals analogous overfitting tendencies and leads us to further propose the use of a corrected BIC (BICc). In their respective settings (whether the true model is, or is not, among the candidate models), BICc and AICc have the desired asymptotic properties and we use simulations to assess their performance, as well as that of other selectors, in nite samples for penalized regressions fit using the Smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalty functions. We nd that AICc and 10-fold cross-validation outperform the other selectors in terms of squared error loss, and BICc avoids the tendency of BIC to select overly complex models when the dimension of the maximum candidate model is large relative to the sample size.",2011,
Predictive models composed by radiomic features extracted from multi-detector computed tomography images for predicting low- and high- grade clear cell renal cell carcinoma,"Abstract To evaluate the values of conventional image features (CIFs) and radiomic features (RFs) extracted from multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) images for predicting low- and high-grade clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Two hundred twenty-seven patients with ccRCC were retrospectively recruited. Five hundred seventy features including 14 CIFs and 556 RFs were extracted from MDCT images of each ccRCC. The CIFs were extracted manually and RFs by the free softwareâ€”MaZda. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) was applied to shrink the high-dimensional data set and select the features. Five predictive models for predicting low- and high-grade ccRCC were constructed by the selected CIFs and RFs. The 5 models were as follows: model of minimum mean squared error (minMSE) of CIFs (CIF-minMSE), minMSE of cortico-medullary phase (CMP) of kidney (CMP-minMSE), minMSE of parenchyma phase (PP) of kidney (PP-minMSE), the combined model of CIF-minMSE and CMP-minMSE (CIF-CMP-minMSE), and the combined model of CIF-minMSE and PP-minMSE (CIF-PP-minMSE). The Lasso regression equation of each model was constructed, and the predictive values were calculated. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of predictive values of the 5 models were drawn by SPSS19.0, and the areas under the curves (AUCs) were calculated. According to Lasso regression, 12, 19 and 10 features were respectively selected from the CIFs, RFs of CMP image and that of PP images to construct the 5 predictive models. The models ordered by their AUCs from large to small were CIF-CMP-minMSE (AUC: 0.986), CIF-PP-minMSE (AUC: 0.981), CIF-minMSE (AUC: 0.980), CMP-minMSE (AUC: 0.975), and PP-minMSE (AUC: 0.963). The maximum diameter of the largest axial section of ccRCC had a maximum weight in predicting the grade of ccRCC among all the features, and its cutoff value was 6.15â€Šcm with a sensitivity of 0.901, a specificity of 0.963, and an AUC of 0.975. When combined with CIFs, RFs extracted from MDCT images contributed to the larger AUC of the predictive model, but were less valuable than CIFs when used alone. The CIF-CMP-minMSE was the optimal predictive model. The maximum diameter of the largest axial section of ccRCC had the largest weight in all features.",2019,Medicine
