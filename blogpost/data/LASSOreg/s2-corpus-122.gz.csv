Inferring Ecological Networks From Species Abundance Data,"Network reconstruction methods are commonly used in molecular biology to construct regulatory networks from information about the expression values of genes in a cell. In ecology, we are presented with a similar problem when trying to reconstruct species interaction networks based on species abundance data. The aim of this project was to see if the methods that proved successful in molecular biology could be applied to this new problem. The methods that I applied and compared were Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Sparse Bayesian Regression (SBR), Graphical Gaussian Models (GGMs) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). To evaluate the performance of these methods, I used data derived from a realistic population simulation model, based on a niche model of species interactions. The experiments showed that these methods were successful at reconstructing the species interaction networks, and that the comparatively simple LASSO, SBR and GGM methods performed as well if not better than the more complex Bayesian Network approaches.",2008,
Machine Learning Techniques for Detecting Hierarchical Interactions in Insurance Claims Models,"This thesis presents an intuitive way to do predictive modeling in actuarial science. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are the standard tool for predictive modeling in the actuarial literature and in actuarial practice, yet GLMs can be quite restrictive. The aim of this work is to model claims and to propose solutions to current actuarial problems such as high variability in large data-sets, variable selection, overfitting, dealing with highly correlated variables and detecting non-linear effects such as interactions. 
 
Regularization techniques are crucial for modeling big data, which means dealing with high-dimensionality, sometimes noisy data that often contains many irrelevant predictors. Penalized regression is a set of regression techniques that impose a constraint/penalty on the regression coefficients and can be used as a powerful variable selection tool as well. They are a generalization of GLMs and include techniques such as Ridge regression, lasso, group-lasso and Elastic Net. The proposed approach is a hierarchical group-lasso-type model that can efficiently handle variable selection and interaction detection between variables while enforcing strong hierarchy. This is achieved by imposing a penalty on the coefficients at the individual and group level. By optimizing the penalized objective function the model performs variable selection and estimation. Additionally, the model automatically detects interactions which is another important factor to achieve a high predictive power. For those purposes the group-lasso method is investigated for the Poisson and gamma distributions to perform frequency-severity modeling.",2016,

Estimation of metabolite networks with regard to a specific covariable: applications to plant and human data,"IntroductionIn systems biology, where a main goal is acquiring knowledge of biological systems, one of the challenges is inferring biochemical interactions from different molecular entities such as metabolites. In this area, the metabolome possesses a unique place for reflecting â€œtrue exposureâ€ by being sensitive to variation coming from genetics, time, and environmental stimuli. While influenced by many different reactions, often the research interest needs to be focused on variation coming from a certain source, i.e. a certain covariable $$\mathbf {X}_m$$Xm.ObjectiveHere, we use network analysis methods to recover a set of metabolite relationships, by finding metabolites sharing a similar relation to $$\mathbf {X}_m$$Xm. Metabolite values are based on information coming from individualsâ€™ $$\mathbf {X}_m$$Xm status which might interact with other covariables.MethodsAlternative to using the original metabolite values, the total information is decomposed by utilizing a linear regression model and the part relevant to $$\mathbf {X}_m$$Xm is further used. For two datasets, two different network estimation methods are considered. The first is weighted gene co-expression network analysis based on correlation coefficients. The second method is graphical LASSO based on partial correlations.ResultsWe observed that when using the parts related to the specific covariable of interest, resulting estimated networks display higher interconnectedness. Additionally, several groups of biologically associated metabolites (very large density lipoproteins, lipoproteins, etc.) were identified in the human data example.ConclusionsThis work demonstrates how information on the study design can be incorporated to estimate metabolite networks. As a result, sets of interconnected metabolites can be clustered together with respect to their relation to a covariable of interest.",2017,Metabolomics
RNA processing genes characterize RNA splicing and further stratify lower-grade glioma.,"BACKGROUND
Aberrant expression of RNA processing genes may drive the alterative RNA profile in lower-grade gliomas (LGGs). Thus, we aimed to further stratify LGGs based on the expression of RNA processing genes.


METHODS
This study included 446 LGGs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, training set) and 171 LGGs from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA, validation set). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression algorithm was conducted to develop a risk-signature. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to study the prognosis value of the risk-signature.


RESULTS
Among the tested 784 RNA processing genes, 276 were significantly correlated with the OS of LGGs. Further LASSO Cox regression identified a 19-gene risk-signature, whose risk score was also an independently prognosis factor (P<0.0001, multiplex Cox regression) in the validation dataset. The signature had better prognostic value than the traditional factors ""age"", ""grade"" and ""WHO 2016 classification"" for 3- and 5-year survival both two datasets (AUCs > 85%). Importantly, the risk-signature could further stratify the survival of LGGs in specific subgroups of WHO 2016 classification. Furthermore, alternative splicing events for genes such as EGFR and FGFR were found to be associated with the risk score. mRNA expression levels for genes, which participated in cell proliferation and other processes, were significantly correlated to the risk score.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results highlight the role of RNA processing genes for further stratifying the survival of patients with LGGs and provide insight into the alternative splicing events underlying this role.",2019,JCI insight
Radiomics analysis of magnetic resonance imaging improves diagnostic performance of lymph node metastasis in patients with cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Robust parameters are needed to predict lymph node metastasis (LNM) in locally advanced cervical cancer patients in order to select optimal treatment regimen. The aim of this study is to utilize radiomics analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to improve diagnostic performance of LNM in cervical cancer patients.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 189 cervical cancer patients were divided into a training cohort (nâ€¯=â€¯126) and a validation cohort (nâ€¯=â€¯63). For each patient, we extracted radiomic features from intratumoral and peritumoral tissues on sagittal T2WI and axial apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Afterward, the radiomic features associated with LNM status were selected by univariate ROC testing and logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty in the training cohort. Based on the selected features, a support vector machine (SVM) model was established to predict LNM status. To further improve the diagnostic performance, a decision tree which combines the radiomics model with clinical factors was built.


RESULTS
Radiomics model of the intratumoral and peritumoral tissues on T2WI (T2tumor+peri) showed best sensitivity and clinical LN (c-LN) status showed best specificity to predict LNM. The decision tree that combines radiomics model of T2tumor+peri and c-LN status achieved best diagnostic performance, with AUC and sensitivity of 0.895 and 94.3%, 0.847 and 100% in the training and validation cohort respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
The decision tree, which incorporates radiomics model of T2tumor+peri and c-LN status can be potentially applied in the preoperative prediction of LNM in locally advanced cervical cancer patients.",2019,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology
a New Risk Assessment Tool for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,"Introduction: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), can be curative for many hematologic disorders. However, HSCT is still associated with significant risks. HSCT outcomes are dependent on patient, disease and transplant related factors. There are a number of assessment tools being used to predict outcomes. Some use patient related variables such as the hematopoietic cell transplantation specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), some use disease-related variables such as the disease-risk index (DRI) and some others incorporate combined variables. We aimed to incorporate disease, patient comorbidities, donor, and transplant characteristics into one comprehensive prognostic model to predict 2 year disease-free survival (DFS). Methods: 273 consecutive patients (162 males, 111 females) receiving an initial HSCT from 2010 and 2016 were identified and retrospectively analyzed. Median age was 56 years (range 18-76 years) and a broad representation of hematologic disorders (119 AML, 46 ALL, 60 MDS, 18 NHL, 30 other) were included. All pts received peripheral blood as graft source. The majority received an unrelated donor transplant (166) and were conditioned with a myeloablative regimen (199). The dataset was randomly split in a 2:1 ratio to create training and testing dataset prior to data analysis. Variables under consideration as predictors of 2 year disease-free survival included: patient (age, sex, blood type, CMV status, Karnofsky Performance Status, HCT-CI), donor (age, sex, blood type, CMV status), disease (type, time since diagnosis, Disease Risk Index), and transplant (prep regimen, year of transplant, related/unrelated, match/mismatch) characteristics. Using the training dataset, a lasso penalized Cox regression was applied with the penalty parameter being derived as the mean of 1,000 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation. Patient risk scores was computed from the model and used to stratify patients based on a median split of risk scores; survival differences were evaluated using the log-rank test. Model performance was evaluated in the training and testing datasets by deriving time-dependent AUC curves, evaluating survival differences by risk strata, and comparing predicted to observed survival probabilities at 2 years. Results: Karnofsky Performance Status ( Conclusion: This comprehensive prognostic model is able to stratify patients into high risk and low risk groups with significantly different outcome. The inclusion of additional variables in the model increased accuracy (higher AUC) relative to existing models, which highlights the importance of taking into consideration additional constructs when trying to predict DFS. Further independent validation of our findings is necessary. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",2017,Blood
Robust immunoscore model to predict the response to anti-PD1 therapy in melanoma,"This study aimed to construct immune-related predictors to identify responders to anti-PD1 therapy of melanoma through CIBERSORT algorithm. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression, we constructed an immunoscore consisting of 8 immune subsets to predict the anti-PD1 response. This score achieved an overall accuracy of AUC = 0.77, 0.80 and 0.73 in the training cohort, validation cohort and on-anti-PD1 cohort, respectively. Patients with high immunoscores had significantly higher objective response rates (ORRs) than did those with low immunoscores (ORR: 53.8% vs 17.7%, P < 0.001 for entire pre-anti-PD1 cohort; 42.1% vs 15.1%, P = 0.022 for on-anti-PD1 cohort; 66.7% vs 16.7%, P = 0.038 for neoadjuvant anti-PD1 cohort). Prolonged survival trends were observed in high-immunoscore group (1-year PFS: 42.4% vs 14.3%, P = 0.059; 3-year OS: 41.5% vs 31.6%, P = 0.057). Furthermore, we found that high-immunoscore group exhibited higher fractions of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and an increased IFN-Î³ response. Analysis of the results of the GSEA indicated a significant enrichment of antitumor immunity pathways in the high-immunoscore group. Therefore, this study indicated that we constructed a robust immunoscore model to predict the anti-PD1 response of metastatic melanoma and the neoadjuvant anti-PD1 response of resectable melanoma.",2019,Aging (Albany NY)
SAT0047â€…Predicting maintenance of response based on disease characteristics and early clinical response in rheumatoid arthritis patients upon withdrawal of adalimumab,"Background Some patients (pts) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) achieve low disease activity (LDA) after treatment with adalimumab (ADA) plus methotrexate (MTX) and can maintain LDA after ADA withdrawal1. However, others experience a flare in disease activity. The factors associated with loss or maintenance of response are not understood. Objectives To identify pt disease characteristics and early clinical responses, which predict maintenance of LDA upon ADA withdrawal in individual RA pts. Methods Data from the OPTIMA trial were used in this post hoc analysis. In period 1 (P1), pts were treated for 26 weeks (wks) with ADA+MTX or placebo (PBO) +MTX. Pts on ADA+MTX who achieved DAS28-CRP <3.2 at wks 22 and 26 (responders) were randomized to ADA withdrawal, or ADA+MTX continuation up to Wk 78. Responders to PBO+MTX in P1 continued on PBO+MTX up to Wk 78 (PBO continuation). Data from the ADA withdrawal arm were used to predict LDA at Wk 78 by DAS28-CRP (â©½3.2) or SDAI (â©½11). Potential factors including baseline (BL) disease characteristics and Wk 26 responses, including DAS28-CRP, SDAI, ACR score components, modified total sharp score (mTSS) and joint space narrowing score (JSN), were screened by the LASSO method2, which performs variable selection by penalizing unduly complicated models, with/without incorporating the speed of DAS28-CRP or SDAI response as an individual predictor. Logistic regression on the LASSO-selected factors yielded coefficients used to derive individual scoring equations and prediction scores for Wk 78 outcomes (fig footnote). Prediction score cutoffs were established by the regression tree method3. The results were validated in data from the PBO continuation arm. Results For the prediction of DAS28-CRP LDA at Wk 78, BL physician global assessment (PhGA) and health-assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI), and Wk 26 DAS28-CRP, HAQ-DI, JSN and CRP were selected by LASSO, and used to calculate the prediction score. Including speed of response did not affect the predictors chosen. Out of 9 pts predicted not to have DAS28-CRP LDA at Wk 78, 0 had LDA (NPV=100%) (fig 1). Out of 66 pts predicted to have DAS28-CRP LDA at Wk 78, 63 predictions were correct (PPV=96.5%). Results were comparable for most cutoff categories in the validation arm (PPV=82%); however, no pts were predicted to have a non-response at Wk 78. For the prediction of SDAI LDA at Wk 78, the NPV was 86% (1/7 predictions incorrect); PPV was 95% (39/41 predictions correct); in the validation arm, the PPV was 82%. Figure. No caption available. Conclusions DAS28-CRP LDA at 78 wks could be individually predicted for up to 63% pts in OPTIMA who withdrew ADA/continued PBO+MTX with 96.5% accuracy, based on demographics and clinical outcomes at 6 months. This instrument could help identify pts who may be able to maintain LDA upon ADA withdrawal. ReferencesSmolen et al, 2013. Lancet;383.Tibshirani, R, 1996.

Bayesian adaptive Lasso,"We propose the Bayesian adaptive Lasso (BaLasso) for variable selection and coefficient estimation in linear regression. The BaLasso is adaptive to the signal level by adopting different shrinkage for different coefficients. Furthermore, we provide a model selection machinery for the BaLasso by assessing the posterior conditional mode estimates, motivated by the hierarchical Bayesian interpretation of the Lasso. Our formulation also permits prediction using a model averaging strategy. We discuss other variants of this new approach and provide a unified framework for variable selection using flexible penalties. Empirical evidence of the attractiveness of the method is demonstrated via extensive simulation studies and data analysis.",2010,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
Coordinate Descent with Online Adaptation of Coordinate Frequencies,"Coordinate descent (CD) algorithms have become the method of choice for solving a number of optimization problems in machine learning. They are particularly popular for training linear models, including linear support vector machine classification, LASSO regression, and logistic regression. 
We consider general CD with non-uniform selection of coordinates. Instead of fixing selection frequencies beforehand we propose an online adaptation mechanism for this important parameter, called the adaptive coordinate frequencies (ACF) method. This mechanism removes the need to estimate optimal coordinate frequencies beforehand, and it automatically reacts to changing requirements during an optimization run. 
We demonstrate the usefulness of our ACF-CD approach for a variety of optimization problems arising in machine learning contexts. Our algorithm offers significant speed-ups over state-of-the-art training methods.",2014,ArXiv
Machine learning approaches for predicting disposition of asthma and COPD exacerbations in the ED,"Objective The prediction of emergency department (ED) disposition at triage remains challenging. Machine learning approaches may enhance prediction. We compared the performance of several machine learning approaches for predicting two clinical outcomes (critical care and hospitalization) among ED patients with asthma or COPD exacerbation. Methods Using the 2007â€“2015 National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) ED data, we identified adults with asthma or COPD exacerbation. In the training set (70% random sample), using routinelyâ€available triage data as predictors (e.g., demographics, arrival mode, vital signs, chief complaint, comorbidities), we derived four machine learningâ€based models: Lasso regression, random forest, boosting, and deep neural network. In the test set (the remaining 30% of sample), we compared their prediction ability against traditional logistic regression with Emergency Severity Index (ESI, reference model). Results Of 3206 eligible ED visits, corresponding to weighted estimates of 13.9 million visits, 4% had critical care outcome and 26% had hospitalization outcome. For the critical care prediction, the best performing approachâ€“ boosting â€“ achieved the highest discriminative ability (Câ€statistics 0.80 vs. 0.68), reclassification improvement (net reclassification improvement [NRI] 53%, P = 0.002), and sensitivity (0.79 vs. 0.53) over the reference model. For the hospitalization prediction, random forest provided the highest discriminative ability (Câ€statistics 0.83 vs. 0.64) reclassification improvement (NRI 92%, P < 0.001), and sensitivity (0.75 vs. 0.33). Results were generally consistent across the asthma and COPD subgroups. Conclusions Based on nationallyâ€representative ED data, machine learning approaches improved the ability to predict disposition of patients with asthma or COPD exacerbation.",2018,American Journal of Emergency Medicine
Majorization-Minimization algorithms for nonsmoothly penalized objective functions,"The use of penalization, or regularization, has become common in high-dimensional statistical analysis, where an increasingly frequent goal is to simultaneously select important variables and estimate their effects. It has been shown by several authors that these goals can be achieved by minimizing some parameter-dependent ""goodness-of-fit"" function (e.g., a negative loglikelihood) subject to a penalization that promotes sparsity. Penalty functions that are singular at the origin have received substantial attention, arguably beginning with the Lasso penalty (62). The current literature tends to focus on specific combinations of dif- ferentiable goodness-of-fit functions and penalty functions singular at the origin. One result of this combined specificity has been a proliferation in the number of computational algorithms designed to solve fairly narrow classes of optimization problems involving objective functions that are not every- where continuously differentiable. In this paper, we propose a general class of algorithms for optimizing an extensive variety of nonsmoothly penalized objective functions that satisfy certain regularity conditions. The proposed framework utilizes the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm as its core optimization engine. In the case of penalized regression models, the resulting algorithms employ iterated soft-thresholding, implemented com- ponentwise, allowing for fast and stable updating that avoids the need for inverting high-dimensional matrices. We establish convergence theory un- der weaker assumptions than previously considered in the statistical litera- ture. We also demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of new acceleration methods, originally proposed for the EM algorithm, in this class of prob- lems. Simulation results and a microarray data example are provided to demonstrate the algorithm's capabilities and versatility.

A quantile regression analysis of the effect of farmers' attitudes and perceptions on market participation,"The objective of this study is to investigate the subjective determinants of farmersâ€™ participation in output markets in five EU New Member States (NMS) characterised by large semi-subsistence sectors. It employs quantile regression to model market participation reflecting the heterogeneity amongst farmers. The study also uses the Bayesian adaptive lasso to simultaneously select important covariates and estimate the corresponding quantile regression models. The empirical results show that only two variables affect all quantiles, while their effect varies across quantiles. Some of the remaining variables affect the share of output sold at the lower quantiles (i.e. for subsistence- and semi-subsistence-oriented farmers) only, whereas other variables are only significant at the upper quantiles (i.e. for more commercially oriented farms). Advisory services, and particularly agricultural business advice, and information and advice on markets and prices can facilitate the market participation of subsistence-oriented farms.",2013,Journal of Agricultural Economics
Modeling gene-covariate interactions in sparse regression with group structure for genome-wide association studies,"Abstract In genome-wide association studies (GWAS), it is of interest to identify genetic variants associated with phenotypes. For a given phenotype, the associated genetic variants are usually a sparse subset of all possible variants. Traditional Lasso-type estimation methods can therefore be used to detect important genes. But the relationship between genotypes at one variant and a phenotype may be influenced by other variables, such as sex and life style. Hence it is important to be able to incorporate gene-covariate interactions into the sparse regression model. In addition, because there is biological knowledge on the manner in which genes work together in structured groups, it is desirable to incorporate this information as well. In this paper, we present a novel sparse regression methodology for gene-covariate models in association studies that not only allows such interactions but also considers biological group structure. Simulation results show that our method substantially outperforms another method, in which interaction is considered, but group structure is ignored. Application to data on total plasma immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentrations in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), using sex and smoking status as covariates, yields several potentially interesting gene-covariate interactions.",2015,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
Doubly Debiased Lasso: High-Dimensional Inference under Hidden Confounding and Measurement Errors,"Inferring causal relationships or related associations from observational data can be invalidated by the existence of hidden confounders or measurement errors. We focus on high-dimensional linear regression settings, where the measured covariates are affected by hidden confounding. We propose the Doubly Debiased Lasso estimator for single components of the regression coefficient vector. Our advocated method is novel as it simultaneously corrects both the bias due to estimating the high-dimensional parameters as well as the bias caused by the hidden confounding. We establish its asymptotic normality and also prove that it is efficient in the Gauss-Markov sense. The validity of our methodology relies on a dense confounding assumption, i.e. that every confounding variable affects many covariates. The finite sample performance is illustrated with an extensive simulation study and a genomic application.",2020,arXiv: Methodology
A Perturbation Method for Inference on Regularized Regression Estimates.,"Analysis of high dimensional data often seeks to identify a subset of important features and assess their effects on the outcome. Traditional statistical inference procedures based on standard regression methods often fail in the presence of high-dimensional features. In recent years, regularization methods have emerged as promising tools for analyzing high dimensional data. These methods simultaneously select important features and provide stable estimation of their effects. Adaptive LASSO and SCAD for instance, give consistent and asymptotically normal estimates with oracle properties. However, in finite samples, it remains difficult to obtain interval estimators for the regression parameters. In this paper, we propose perturbation resampling based procedures to approximate the distribution of a general class of penalized parameter estimates. Our proposal, justified by asymptotic theory, provides a simple way to estimate the covariance matrix and confidence regions. Through finite sample simulations, we verify the ability of this method to give accurate inference and compare it to other widely used standard deviation and confidence interval estimates. We also illustrate our proposals with a data set used to study the association of HIV drug resistance and a large number of genetic mutations.",2011,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Abstract PD3-02: Polygenic risk scores provide clinically meaningful risk stratification among women carrying moderate penetrance pathogenic variants in breast cancer predisposition genes: Results from the CARRIERS study,"Background: Pathogenic variants detected in multi-gene cancer predisposition panels are increasingly used to counsel women regarding their risk for breast cancer. However, the clinical implications of moderate penetrance genes (e.g. CHEK2, ATM) remain unclear. Breast MRI is indicated for women with a lifetime risk of breast cancer of >20%, and polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on common variants discovered in recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may identify women with pathogenic variants in CHEK2 and ATM who are above or below this level of risk. PRS may also stratify carriers with substantially elevated lifetime risks of breast cancer. Previous work found that PRS modified breast cancer risk in carriers of pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2, but the joint effects of pathogenic variants and PRS have not been studied in samples drawn from the general population. There is also no published study evaluating the effect of PRS among women with pathogenic variants in genes other than BRCA1/2 and CHEK2. Here, we evaluated the joint effects of PRS and pathogenic variants in ten established breast cancer predisposition genes in a population-based case-control sample. Method: We analyzed 43,144 non-Hispanic European-ancestry individuals (20,988 controls and 22,120 cases) drawn from 7 cohorts and 2 population-based case-control studies in the CAnceR RIsk Estimates Related to Susceptibilityâ€ (CARRIERS) consortium. Targeted sequencing was performed using a dual bar-coded QIAseq panel of breast cancer predisposition genes. Variant calling was conducted with Haplotype Caller and Vardict. The PRS was calculated based on 106 common variants using effect estimates from the largest published breast cancer GWAS. Genetic status was evaluated for 10 breast cancer predisposition genes: ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, NF1, PALB2 and TP53. Lasso Penalized regression was performed to assess the combined effect on overall breast cancer of pathogenic variants and common variants (including main and interaction effects between age, family history, carrier status and PRS). The fraction of women at >2-fold increased risk (which is associated with approximately 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer) was calculated for pathogenic variant carriers and non-carriers of different family history and age groups ( 70yrs old). Results: Among non-carriers, one standard deviation change in the PRS was associated with a 1.63x change in odds of breast cancer. The best-fitting risk model did not include any PRS-by-carrier interaction terms, implying the relative risk gradient associated with PRS among women with pathogenic variants is similar to that among non-carriers. For carriers of pathogenic variants in moderate penetrance genes with no family history of breast cancer, the PRS can identify 60.6% of ATM pathogenic variant carriers and 30% of CHEK2 pathogenic variant carriers that have less than 2-fold risk of breast cancer; when carriers have a family history of breast cancer, the PRS can identify 30% of ATM pathogenic variant carriers and 11.8% of CHEK2 pathogenic variant carriers with less than 2-fold risk of breast cancer. Conclusion: In our large, population-based case-control study, the effect of the PRS among pathogenic variant carriers was not significantly different than among non-carriers. However, the PRS may be particularly important for estimating breast cancer risk among carriers of pathogenic variants in moderate penetrance genes such as CHEK2 and ATM, enabling a more precise approach for MRI screening strategy and breast cancer risk management.

Sparse Temporal Difference Learning Using LASSO,"We consider the problem of on-line value function estimation in reinforcement learning. We concentrate on the function approximator to use. To try to break the curse of dimensionality, we focus on non parametric function approximators. We propose to fit the use of kernels into the temporal difference algorithms by using regression via the LASSO. We introduce the equi-gradient descent algorithm (EGD) which is a direct adaptation of the one recently introduced in the LARS algorithm family for solving the LASSO. We advocate our choice of the EGD as a judicious algorithm for these tasks. We present the EGD algorithm in details as well as some experimental results. We insist on the qualities of the EGD for reinforcement learning.",2007,2007 IEEE International Symposium on Approximate Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning
The Effect of Education on Health Perception and Health Related Behavior: Evidence from the Russian Federation,"We use individual data from SAGE and RLMS surveys to infer whether education has an effect on the health of Russian citizens. Both direct and indirect ways of impact are estimated by means of the variety of econometrics methods. IV regression is used to assess the former effect which implies profound changes in understanding individualâ€™s health and how health care system works. The latter way means changes in the health-related behaviour, estimates for which are deduced by OLS. Different statistical methods like Lasso regression and Generalized Additive Model with splines are used to go far beyond OLS results. The obtained results confirm the existence and significance of both ways of impact: better educated people understand their health and bodies better and also switch to a much healthier way of life.",2016,
Overlapping group lasso for high-dimensional generalized linear models,"Abstract Structured sparsity has recently been a very popular technique to deal with the high-dimensional data. In this paper, we mainly focus on the theoretical problems for the overlapping group structure of generalized linear models (GLMs). Although the overlapping group lasso method for GLMs has been widely applied in some applications, the theoretical properties about it are still unknown. Under some general conditions, we presents the oracle inequalities for the estimation and prediction error of overlapping group Lasso method in the generalized linear model setting. Then, we apply these results to the so-called Logistic and Poisson regression models. It is shown that the results of the Lasso and group Lasso procedures for GLMs can be recovered by specifying the group structures in our proposed method. The effect of overlap and the performance of variable selection of our proposed method are both studied by numerical simulations. Finally, we apply our proposed method to two gene expression data sets: the p53 data and the lung cancer data.",2019,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
A Framework for Inter-Subject Prediction of Functional Connectivity From Structural Networks,"Functional connections between brain regions are supported by structural connectivity. Both functional and structural connectivity are estimated from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and offer complementary information on brain organization and function. However, imaging only provides noisy measures, and we lack a good neuroscientific understanding of the links between structure and function. Therefore, inter-subject joint modeling of structural and functional connectivity, the key to multimodal biomarkers, is an open challenge. We present a probabilistic framework to learn across subjects a mapping from structural to functional brain connectivity. Expanding on our previous work [1], our approach is based on a predictive framework with multiple sparse linear regression. We rely on the randomized LASSO to identify relevant anatomo-functional links with some confidence interval. In addition, we describe resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in the setting of Gaussian graphical models, on the one hand imposing conditional independences from structural connectivity and on the other hand parameterizing the problem in terms of multivariate autoregressive models. We introduce an intrinsic measure of prediction error for functional connectivity that is independent of the parameterization chosen and provides the means for robust model selection. We demonstrate our methodology with regions within the default mode and the salience network as well as, atlas-based cortical parcellation.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
Matrix-Similarity Based Loss Function and Feature Selection for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis,"Recent studies on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), diagnosis presented that the tasks of identifying brain disease status and predicting clinical scores based on neuroimaging features were highly related to each other. However, these tasks were often conducted independently in the previous studies. Regarding the feature selection, to our best knowledge, most of the previous work considered a loss function defined as an element-wise difference between the target values and the predicted ones. In this paper, we consider the problems of joint regression and classification for AD/MCI diagnosis and propose a novel matrix-similarity based loss function that uses high-level information inherent in the target response matrix and imposes the information to be preserved in the predicted response matrix. The newly devised loss function is combined with a group lasso method for joint feature selection across tasks, i.e., clinical scores prediction and disease status identification. We conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and showed that the newly devised loss function was effective to enhance the performances of both clinical score prediction and disease status identification, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.",2014,2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
Identification of survival-associated alternative splicing events and signatures in adrenocortical carcinoma based on TCGA SpliceSeq data,"OBJECTIVE
To explore the correlations among alternative splicing (AS), splicing factors (SF) and survival outcome in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) patients.


RESULTS
A total of 92 ACC patients were included. Univariate analysis identified 3919 AS events significantly associated with overall survival. Lasso method followed by multivariate analysis revealed that the prognostic capacity of these survival-related AS events is satisfactory. Interestingly, we found that the area under the curve (AUC) of AA, AD, AP and RI were more than 0.9, indicating that these four types of AS were of great significance. Independent prognostic analysis showed that only the risk score was the independent risk factor of ACC survival. Finally, we constructed an interesting interaction network between AS and SF.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first and most comprehensive study to explore the aberrant AS variants in ACC, which might provide novel insights into molecular mechanism of ACC.


METHODS
The transcriptome data, clinical information and Percent Spliced In (PSI) values of the ACC were obtained from TCGA database and TCGA SpliceSeq data portal. Lasso method and uni/multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to identify survival-related AS events and develop multi-AS-based signatures. The relationship between AS events and SFs was also investigated.",2020,Aging (Albany NY)
The differential impact of state tobacco control policies on cessation treatment utilization across established tobacco disparities groups.,"Tobacco control policies are effective in promoting quit attempts and increase the likelihood that smokers use evidence-based cessation treatments (e.g., nicotine replacement therapies (NRT), non-NRT medications, behavioral treatment, and/or quitlines). However, what is less clear is how these policies might differentially impact different groups of smokers, perhaps in some cases even widening disparities in the use of evidence-based tobacco dependence treatments. This paper examined how different state-level tobacco control policies impact the use of evidence-based cessation treatments by race/ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status (SES), age, and smoking history. Participants included 9110 adult smokers reporting a past-year quit attempt within the 2010-2011 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. Lasso regression modeling was used to identify a subset of interactions between tobacco policies and individual smoker characteristics that predicted use of evidence-based cessation treatment. Significant interactions were fitted via participant-weighted generalized linear models to determine effect sizes and relations to each cessation treatment outcome. Results highlighted that various state level tobacco control policies differentially impacted the reported use of both prescription and non-prescription stop smoking medications by race/ethnicity, age, and SES. The relationship between state level tobacco control policies and the use of behavioral treatments and quitlines did not differ by smoker characteristics. In sum, tobacco control policies differentially impact the use of FDA approved stop smoking medications across different race/ethnicity, age, and SES groups. Understanding such effects can help to target interventions to ensure equal access to evidence-based tobacco dependence treatments.",2017,Preventive medicine
A Least Squares Method for Detecting Multiple Change Points in a Univariate Time Series,"Detecting and interpreting influential turning points in time series data is a routine research question in many disciplines of applied social science research. Here we propose a method for identifying important turning points in a univariate time series. The most rudimentary methods are inadequate when the researcher lacks preexisting expectations or hypotheses concerning where such turning points ought to exist. Other alternatives are computationally intensive and dependent on strict model assumptions. Our method is fused LASSO regression, a variant of regularized least squares method, providing a convenient alternative for estimation and inference of multiple change points under mild assumptions. We provide two examples to illustrate the method in social science applications. First, we assessed the validity of our method by reanalyzing the Greenback prices data used in (Willard et al. in Am Econ Rev 86:1001â€“1017, 1996). We next used the method to identify major change points in President Clintonâ€™s approval ratings.",2018,
"Iterative Hard Thresholding in GWAS: Generalized Linear Models, Prior Weights, and Double Sparsity","Background Consecutive testing of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is usually employed to identify genetic variants associated with complex traits. Ideally one should model all covariates in unison, but most existing analysis methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) perform only univariate regression. Results We extend and efficiently implement iterative hard thresholding (IHT) for multiple regression, treating all SNPs simultaneously. Our extensions accommodate generalized linear models (GLMs), prior information on genetic variants, and grouping of variants. In our simulations, IHT recovers up to 30% more true predictors than SNP-by-SNP association testing, and exhibits a 2 to 3 orders of magnitude decrease in false positive rates compared to lasso regression. We also test IHT on the UK Biobank hypertension phenotypes and the Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1966 cardiovascular phenotypes. We find that IHT scales to the large datasets of contemporary human genetics and recovers the plausible genetic variants identified by previous studies. Conclusions Our real data analysis and simulation studies suggest that IHT can (a) recover highly correlated predictors, (b) avoid over-fitting, (c) deliver better true positive and false positive rates than either marginal testing or lasso regression, (d) recover unbiased regression coefficients, (e) exploit prior information and group-sparsity and (f) be used with biobank sized data sets. Although these advances are studied for GWAS inference, our extensions are pertinent to other regression problems with large numbers of predictors.",2019,bioRxiv
Robust colour calibration of an imaging system using a colour space transform and advanced regression modelling.,"A new algorithm for the conversion of device dependent RGB colour data into device independent L*a*b* colour data without introducing noticeable error has been developed. By combining a linear colour space transform and advanced multiple regression methodologies it was possible to predict L*a*b* colour data with less than 2.2 colour units of error (CIE 1976). By transforming the red, green and blue colour components into new variables that better reflect the structure of the L*a*b* colour space, a low colour calibration error was immediately achieved (Î”E(CAL) = 14.1). Application of a range of regression models on the data further reduced the colour calibration error substantially (multilinear regression Î”E(CAL) = 5.4; response surface Î”E(CAL) = 2.9; PLSR Î”E(CAL) = 2.6; LASSO regression Î”E(CAL) = 2.1). Only the PLSR models deteriorated substantially under cross validation. The algorithm is adaptable and can be easily recalibrated to any working computer vision system. The algorithm was tested on a typical working laboratory computer vision system and delivered only a very marginal loss of colour information Î”E(CAL) = 2.35. Colour features derived on this system were able to safely discriminate between three classes of ham with 100% correct classification whereas colour features measured on a conventional colourimeter were not.",2012,Meat science
