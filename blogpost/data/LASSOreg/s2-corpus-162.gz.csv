Stress and Self-Efficacy as Long-Term Predictors for Chronic Low Back Pain: A Prospective Longitudinal Study,"Purpose
Psychosocial variables are known risk factors for the development and chronification of low back pain (LBP). Psychosocial stress is one of these risk factors. Therefore, this study aims to identify the most important types of stress predicting LBP. Self-efficacy was included as a potential protective factor related to both, stress and pain.


Participants and Methods
This prospective observational study assessed n = 1071 subjects with low back pain over 2 years. Psychosocial stress was evaluated in a broad manner using instruments assessing perceived stress, stress experiences in work and social contexts, vital exhaustion and life-event stress. Further, self-efficacy and pain (characteristic pain intensity and disability) were assessed. Using least absolute shrinkage selection operator regression, important predictors of characteristic pain intensity and pain-related disability at 1-year and 2-years follow-up were analyzed.


Results
The final sample for the statistic procedure consisted of 588 subjects (age: 39.2 (Â±13.4) years; baseline pain intensity: 27.8 (Â±18.4); disability: 14.3 (Â±17.9)). In the 1-year follow-up, the stress types ""tendency to worry"", ""social isolation"", ""work discontent"" as well as vital exhaustion and negative life events were identified as risk factors for both pain intensity and pain-related disability. Within the 2-years follow-up, Lasso models identified the stress types ""tendency to worry"", ""social isolation"", ""social conflicts"", and ""perceived long-term stress"" as potential risk factors for both pain intensity and disability. Furthermore, ""self-efficacy"" (""internality"", ""self-concept"") and ""social externality"" play a role in reducing pain-related disability.


Conclusion
Stress experiences in social and work-related contexts were identified as important risk factors for LBP 1 or 2 years in the future, even in subjects with low initial pain levels. Self-efficacy turned out to be a protective factor for pain development, especially in the long-term follow-up. Results suggest a differentiation of stress types in addressing psychosocial factors in research, prevention and therapy approaches.",2020,Journal of Pain Research
Fault Relevant Variable Selection for Fault Diagnosis,"In process monitoring, fault relevant variable selection and fault diagnosis are two important branches. But they are often discussed independently and scarcely integrated in research. To integrate them, a novel fault diagnosis algorithm based on fault relevant variable selection is proposed in this paper. The main contents are summarized as follows. For fault relevant variable selection, from normal state to fault state, the relative changes between variables and statistics are analyzed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). In order to determine the optimal set of fault relevant variable, a fault reconstruction algorithm based on least angle regression (LARS) is proposed. The set of relevant variables is constantly updated until there is no abnormality after reconstruction. Finally, a monitoring strategy based on fault subspace is proposed. It can detect fault effectively and provide useful information for fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by some experiments.",2020,IEEE Access
The DNA methylation profile of non-coding RNAs improves prognosis prediction for pancreatic adenocarcinoma,"BackgroundCompelling lines of evidence indicate that DNA methylation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) plays critical roles in various tumour progression. In addition, the differential methylation of ncRNAs can predict prognosis of patients. However, little is known about the clear relationship between DNA methylation profile of ncRNAs and the prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) patients.MethodsThe data of DNA methylation, RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and clinical features of PAC patients were collected from TCGA database. The DNA methylation profile was obtained using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. LASSO regression was performed to construct two methylation-based classifiers. The risk score of methylation-based classifiers was calculated for each patient, and the accuracy of the classifiers in predicting overall survival (OS) was examined by ROC curve analysis. In addition, Cox regression models were utilized to assess whether clinical variables and the classifiers were independent prognostic factors for OS. The targets of miRNA and the genes co-expressed with lncRNA were identified with DIANA microT-CDS and the Multi-Experiment Matrix (MEM), respectively. Moreover, DAVID Bioinformatics Resources were applied to analyse the functional enrichment of these targets and co-expressed genes.ResultsA total of 4004 CpG sites of miRNA and 11,259 CpG sites of lncRNA were screened. Among these CpG sites, 8 CpG sites of miRNA and 7 CpG sites of lncRNA were found with regression coefficients. By multiplying the sum of methylation degrees of the selected CpGs with these coefficients, two methylation-based classifiers were constructed. The classifiers have shown good performance in predicting the survival rate of PAC patients at varying follow-up times. Interestingly, both of these two classifiers were predominant and independent factors for OS. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that aberrantly methylated miRNAs and lncRNAs are related to calcium ion transmembrane transport and MAPK, Ras and calcium signalling pathways.ConclusionIn the present study, we identified two methylation-based classifiers of ncRNA associated with OS in PAC patients through a comprehensive analysis of miRNA and lncRNA profiles. We are the first group to demonstrate a relationship between the aberrant DNA methylation of ncRNAs and the prognosis of PAC, and this relationship would contribute to individualized PAC therapy.",2019,Cancer Cell International
Ridge and Lasso Performance in Spatial Data with Heterogeneity and Multicollinearity,"Spatial heterogeneity becomes a separate issue on the analysis of spatial data. GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) is a statistical technique to explore spatial nonstationarity by form the differrent regression models at different point in observation space. Multicollinearity is a condition that the independent variables in model have linear relationship. It would be a problem for estimation parameters process, because that condition produces unstable model. This problem may be found in GWR models, which allow the linear relationship between independent variables at each location called local multicollinearity. GWRR (Geographically Weighted Ridge Regression) and GWL (Geographically Weighted Lasso) which use the concept of ridge and lasso is shrink the regression coefficient in GWR model. GWRR and GWL techniques are consider to be capable of overcoming local multicollinearity to produce more stable models with lower variance. In this study, GWRR and GWL is used to model Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) in Java using kernel exponential weighted function. The results showed that GWL has better performance to predict GRDP with lower RMSE and higher value than GWRR. Keyword : Spatial Heterogeneity, GWR, Local Multicollinearity, Ridge, Lasso",2015,

Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Methods for Genomic Selection of Traits with Additive and Epistatic Genetic Architectures,"Parametric and nonparametric methods have been developed for purposes of predicting phenotypes. These methods are based on retrospective analyses of empirical data consisting of genotypic and phenotypic scores. Recent reports have indicated that parametric methods are unable to predict phenotypes of traits with known epistatic genetic architectures. Herein, we review parametric methods including least squares regression, ridge regression, Bayesian ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Bayesian LASSO, best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes C, and Bayes CÏ€. We also review nonparametric methods including Nadaraya-Watson estimator, reproducing kernel Hilbert space, support vector machine regression, and neural networks. We assess the relative merits of these 14 methods in terms of accuracy and mean squared error (MSE) using simulated genetic architectures consisting of completely additive or two-way epistatic interactions in an F2 population derived from crosses of inbred lines. Each simulated genetic architecture explained either 30% or 70% of the phenotypic variability. The greatest impact on estimates of accuracy and MSE was due to genetic architecture. Parametric methods were unable to predict phenotypic values when the underlying genetic architecture was based entirely on epistasis. Parametric methods were slightly better than nonparametric methods for additive genetic architectures. Distinctions among parametric methods for additive genetic architectures were incremental. Heritability, i.e., proportion of phenotypic variability, had the second greatest impact on estimates of accuracy and MSE.",2014,G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics
Bayesian Masking: Sparse Bayesian Estimation with Weaker Shrinkage Bias,"A common strategy for sparse linear regression is to introduce regularization, which eliminates irrelevant features by letting the corresponding weights be zeros. However, regularization often shrinks the estimator for relevant features, which leads to incorrect feature selection. Motivated by the above-mentioned issue, we propose Bayesian masking (BM), a sparse estimation method which imposes no regularization on the weights. The key concept of BM is to introduce binary latent variables that randomly mask features. Estimating the masking rates determines the relevance of the features automatically. We derive a variational Bayesian inference algorithm that maximizes the lower bound of the factorized information criterion (FIC), which is a recently developed asymptotic criterion for evaluating the marginal log-likelihood. In addition, we propose reparametrization to accelerate the convergence of the derived algorithm. Finally, we show that BM outperforms Lasso and automatic relevance determination (ARD) in terms of the sparsity-shrinkage trade-off.",2015,ArXiv
Grouped variable selection in high dimensional partially linear additive Cox model,"In the analysis of survival outcome supplemented with both clinical information and high-dimensional gene expression data, traditional Cox proportional hazard model fails to meet some emerging needs in biological research. First, the number of covariates is generally much larger the sample size. Secondly, predicting an outcome with individual gene expressions is inadequate because a geneâ€™s expression is regulated by multiple biological processes and functional units. There is a need to understand the impact of changes at a higher level such as molecular function, cellular component, biological process, or pathway. The change at a higher level is usually measured with a set of gene expressions related to the biological process. That is, we need to model the outcome with gene sets as variable groups and the gene sets could be partially overlapped also. In this thesis work, we investigate the impact of a penalized Cox regression procedure on regularization, parameter estimation, variable group selection, and nonparametric modeling of nonlinear effects with a time-to-event outcome. We formulate the problem as a partially linear additive Cox model with high-dimensional data. We group genes into gene sets and approximate the nonparametric components by truncated series expansions with B-spline bases. After grouping and approximation, the problem of variable selection becomes that of selecting groups of coefficients in a gene set or in an approximation. We apply the group Lasso to obtain an initial solution path and reduce the dimension of",2018,
Identification of a six-lncRNA signature associated with recurrence of ovarian cancer,"Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is the leading cause of death among all gynecological malignancies, and recurrent OvCa is almost always incurable. In this study, we developed a signature based on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with OvCa recurrence to facilitate personalized OvCa therapy. lncRNA expression data were extracted from GSE9891 and GSE30161. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) penalized regression was used to identify an lncRNA-based signature using the GSE9891 training cohort. The signature was then validated in GSE9891 internal and GSE30161 external validation cohorts. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to explore the possible functions of identified lncRNAs. A six-lncRNA signature (RUNX1-IT1, MALAT1, H19, HOTAIRM1, LOC100190986 and AL132709.8) was identified in the training cohort and validated in internal and external validation cohorts using the LASSO method (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). This signature was also independent of other clinical factors according to multivariate and sub-group analyses. The identified lncRNAs are involved in cancer-related biological processes and pathways. We selected a highly reliable signature based on six lncRNAs associated with OvCa recurrence. This six-lncRNA signature is a promising method to personalize ovarian cancer therapy and may improve patient quality of life quality according to patientsâ€™ condition in the future.",2017,Scientific Reports
Sparse Laplacian Shrinkage with the Graphical Lasso Estimator for Regression Problems.,"This paper considers a high-dimensional linear regression problem where there are complex correlation structures among predictors. We propose a graph-constrained regularization procedure, named Sparse Laplacian Shrinkage with the Graphical Lasso Estimator (SLS-GLE). The procedure uses the estimated precision matrix to describe the specific information on the conditional dependence pattern among predictors, and encourages both sparsity on the regression model and the graphical model. We introduce the Laplacian quadratic penalty adopting the graph information, and give detailed discussions on the advantages of using the precision matrix to construct the Laplacian matrix. Theoretical properties and numerical comparisons are presented to show that the proposed method improves both model interpretability and accuracy of estimation. We also apply this method to a financial problem and prove that the proposed procedure is successful in assets selection.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
On the Performance of Variable Selection and Classification via Rank-Based Classifier,"In high-dimensional gene expression data analysis, the accuracy and reliability of cancer classification and selection of important genes play a very crucial role. To identify these important genes and predict future outcomes (tumor vs. non-tumor), various methods have been proposed in the literature. But only few of them take into account correlation patterns and grouping effects among the genes. In this article, we propose a rank-based modification of the popular penalized logistic regression procedure based on a combination of l 1 and l 2 penalties capable of handling possible correlation among genes in different groups. While the l 1 penalty maintains sparsity, the l 2 penalty induces smoothness based on the information from the Laplacian matrix, which represents the correlation pattern among genes. We combined logistic regression with the BH-FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate) screening procedure and a newly developed rank-based selection method to come up with an optimal model retaining the important genes. Through simulation studies and real-world application to high-dimensional colon cancer gene expression data, we demonstrated that the proposed rank-based method outperforms such currently popular methods as lasso, adaptive lasso and elastic net when applied both to gene selection and classification.",2019,
Improving estimations in quantile regression model with autoregressive errors,"An important issue is that the respiratory mortality may be a result of air pollution which can be measured by the following variables: temperature, relative humidity, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrocarbons, ozone and particulates. The usual way is to fit a model using the ordinary least squares regression, which has some assumptions, also known as Gauss-Markov assumptions, on the error term showing white noise process of the regression model. However, in many applications, especially for this example, these assumptions are not satisfied. Therefore, in this study, a quantile regression approach is used to model the respiratory mortality using the mentioned explanatory variables. Moreover, improved estimation techniques such as preliminary testing and shrinkage strategies are also obtained when the errors are autoregressive. A Monte Carlo simulation experiment, including the quantile penalty estimators such as Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net, is designed to evaluate the performances of the proposed techniques. Finally, the theoretical risks of the listed estimators are given.",2017,Thermal Science
Driving behaviors associated with emergency service vehicle crashes in the U.S. fire service.,"OBJECTIVE
Emergency service vehicle incidents are a leading cause of firefighter fatalities and are also hazardous to civilian road users. Modifiable driving behaviors may be associated with emergency service vehicle incidents. The goal of this study was to use telematics to identify driving behaviors associated with crashes in the fire service.


METHODS
Forty-three emergency service vehicles in 2 fire departments were equipped with telematics devices (12 in Department A and 31 in Department B). The devices collected vehicle coordinates, speed, and g forces, which were monitored for exceptions to driving rules established by the fire departments regarding speeding, harsh braking, and hard cornering. Fire department administrative reports were used to identify vehicles involved in crashes and merged with daily telematics data. Penalized logistic regression was used to identify driving rules associated with crashes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to generate a telematics-based risk index for emergency service vehicle incidents.


RESULTS
Nearly 1.1 million km of driving data and 44 crashes were recorded among the 2 departments during the study. Harsh braking was associated with increased odds of crash in Department A (odds ratio [OR]â€‰=â€‰2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-4.51) and Department B (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.55; 95% CI, 1.12-2.15). For every kilometer of nonemergency speeding, the odds of crash increased by 35% in Department A (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.35; 95% CI, 1.03-1.77) and by over 2-fold in Department B (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.09; 95% CI, 1.19-3.66). In Department B, hard cornering (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.14; 95% CI, 1.03-1.26) and emergency speeding (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.65; 95% CI, 1.06-2.57) were also associated with increased odds of crash. The final LASSO risk index model had a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 57%.


CONCLUSIONS
Harsh braking and excessive speeding were driving behaviors most associated with crash in the fire service. Telematics may be a useful tool for monitoring driver safety in the fire service.",2018,Traffic injury prevention
A robust gene signature for the prediction of early relapse in stage Iâ€“III colon cancer,"Colon cancer patients experiencing early relapse consistently exhibited poor survival. The aim of our study was to develop an mRNA signature that can help to detect early relapse cases in stage I-III colon cancer. Public microarray datasets of stage I-III colon cancer samples were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Propensity score matching analysis was performed between patients in the early relapse group and the long-term survival group from GSE39582 discovery series (NÂ =Â 386), and patients were 1Â :Â 1 matched. Global mRNA expression changes were then analyzed between the paired groups to identify the differentially expressed genes. Lasso Cox regression modeling analysis was conducted for the selection of prognostic mRNA. Fifteen mRNA were finally identified to build an early relapse classifier. With specific risk score formula, patients were classified into a high-risk group and a low-risk group. Relapse-free survival was significantly different between the two groups in every series, including discovery [hazard ratio (HR): 2.547, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.708-3.797, PÂ <Â 0.001)], internal validation (HR: 5.146, 95% CI: 1.968-13.457, PÂ <Â 0.001), and external validation (HR: 1.977, 95% CI: 1.295-3.021, PÂ <Â 0.001) sets of patients. Time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic at 1Â year suggested more prognostic accuracy of the classifier [area under curve (AUCÂ =Â 0.703)] than the American Joint Commission on Cancer tumor-node-metastasis staging system (AUCÂ =Â 0.659) in all 951 patients. In conclusion, we developed a robust mRNA signature that can effectively classify colon cancer patients into groups with low and high risks of early relapse. This mRNA signature may help select high-risk colon cancer patients who require more aggressive therapeutic intervention.",2018,Molecular Oncology
Association of the IL-10 Gene Family Locus on Chromosome 1 with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA),"BACKGROUND
The cytokine IL-10 and its family members have been implicated in autoimmune diseases and we have previously reported that genetic variants in IL-10 were associated with a rare group of diseases called juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The aim of this study was to fine map genetic variants within the IL-10 cytokine family cluster on chromosome 1 using linkage disequilibrium (LD)-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) approach with imputation and conditional analysis to test for disease associations.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Fifty-three tSNPs were tested for association between Caucasian paediatric cohorts [219 systemic JIA (sJIA), 187 persistent oligoarticular JIA (pOJIA), and 139 extended OJIA (eOJIA) patients], and controls (Wellcome Trust control cohort, WTCCC2). Significant association with sJIA was detected at rs1400986 in the promoter of IL-20 (odds ratio 1.53; 95% CI 1.21-1.93; pâ€Š=â€Š0.0004), but in no other subtypes. Imputation analysis identified additional associated SNPs for pOJIA at IL-20 and IL-24, including a rare, functional, missense variant at IL-24 with a pâ€Š=â€Š0.0002. Penalised logistic regression analysis with HyperLasso and conditional analysis identified several further associations with JIA subtypes. In particular, haplotype analysis refined the sJIA association, with a joint effect at rs1400986 and rs4129024 in intron 1 of MAPKAPK2 (pâ€Š=â€Š3.2E-5). For pOJIA, a 3-SNP haplotype including rs1878672 in intron 3 of IL-10 showed evidence for association (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0018). In eOJIA, rs10863962 (3'UTR of FCAMR) and rs12409577 (intron of IL-19) haplotype showed some evidence of association (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0003).


CONCLUSIONS
This study supports previous association of IL-20 with sJIA. Haplotype analyses provided stronger association signals than single point analyses, while a penalised logistic regression approach also suggested multiple independent association signals. Replication studies are required to confirm or refute these findings. The results indicate that combined effects with unknown/rare variants remain to be characterised in JIA, and represent a possible example of synthetic association in this region.",2012,PLoS ONE

Perceptual quality estimation of H.264/AVC videos using reduced-reference and no-reference models,"Abstract. Reduced-reference (RR) and no-reference (NR) models for video quality estimation, using features that account for the impact of coding artifacts, spatio-temporal complexity, and packet losses, are proposed. The purpose of this study is to analyze a number of potentially quality-relevant features in order to select the most suitable set of features for building the desired models. The proposed sets of features have not been used in the literature and some of the features are used for the first time in this study. The features are employed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), which selects only the most influential of them toward perceptual quality. For comparison, we apply feature selection in the complete feature sets and ridge regression on the reduced sets. The models are validated using a database of H.264/AVC encoded videos that were subjectively assessed for quality in an ITU-T compliant laboratory. We infer that just two features selected by RR LASSO and two bitstream-based features selected by NR LASSO are able to estimate perceptual quality with high accuracy, higher than that of ridge, which uses more features. The comparisons with competing works and two full-reference metrics also verify the superiority of our models.",2016,Journal of Electronic Imaging
Identifying Complex Brain Networks Using Penalized Regression Methods,"The recorded electrical activity of complex brain networks through the EEG reflects their intrinsic spatial, temporal and spectral properties. In this work we study the application of new penalized regression methods to i) the spatial characterization of the brain networks associated with the identification of faces and ii) the PARAFAC analysis of resting-state EEG. The use of appropriate constraints through non-convex penalties allowed three types of inverse solutions (Loreta, Lasso Fusion and ENet L) to spatially localize networks in agreement with previous studies with fMRI. Furthermore, we propose a new penalty based in the Information Entropy for the constrained PARAFAC analysis of resting EEG that allowed the identification in time, frequency and space of those brain networks with minimum spectral entropy. This study is an initial attempt to explicitly include complexity descriptors as a constraint in multilinear EEG analysis.",2008,Journal of Biological Physics
An Ensemble Approach to Knowledge-Based Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy Planning,"Knowledge-based planning (KBP) utilizes experienced planners' knowledge embedded in prior plans to estimate optimal achievable dose volume histogram (DVH) of new cases. In the regression-based KBP framework, previously planned patients' anatomical features and DVHs are extracted, and prior knowledge is summarized as the regression coefficients that transform features to organ-at-risk DVH predictions. In our study, we find that in different settings, different regression methods work better. To improve the robustness of KBP models, we propose an ensemble method that combines the strengths of various linear regression models, including stepwise, lasso, elastic net, and ridge regression. In the ensemble approach, we first obtain individual model prediction metadata using in-training-set leave-one-out cross validation. A constrained optimization is subsequently performed to decide individual model weights. The metadata is also used to filter out impactful training set outliers. We evaluate our method on a fresh set of retrospectively retrieved anonymized prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) cases and head and neck IMRT cases. The proposed approach is more robust against small training set size, wrongly labeled cases, and dosimetric inferior plans, compared with other individual models. In summary, we believe the improved robustness makes the proposed method more suitable for clinical settings than individual models.",2018,Frontiers in Oncology
Bayesian Gaussian Graphical models using sparse selection priors and their mixtures,"Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models Using Sparse Selection Priors and Their Mixtures. (August 2011) Rajesh Talluri, B.Tech., Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati Co-Chairs of Advisory Committee: Dr. Bani K. Mallick Dr. Veerabhadran Baladandayuthapani We propose Bayesian methods for estimating the precision matrix in Gaussian graphical models. The methods lead to sparse and adaptively shrunk estimators of the precision matrix, and thus conduct model selection and estimation simultaneously. Our methods are based on selection and shrinkage priors leading to parsimonious parameterization of the precision (inverse covariance) matrix, which is essential in several applications in learning relationships among the variables. In Chapter I, we employ the Laplace prior on the off-diagonal element of the precision matrix, which is similar to the lasso model in a regression context. This type of prior encourages sparsity while providing shrinkage estimates. Secondly we introduce a novel type of selection prior that develops a sparse structure of the precision matrix by making most of the elements exactly zero, ensuring positive-definiteness. In Chapter II we extend the above methods to perform classification. Reversephase protein array (RPPA) analysis is a powerful, relatively new platform that allows for high-throughput, quantitative analysis of protein networks. One of the challenges that currently limits the potential of this technology is the lack of methods that allows for accurate data modeling and identification of related networks and samples. Such models may improve the accuracy of biological sample classification based on patterns of protein network activation, and provide insight into the distinct biological relationships underlying different cancers. We propose a Bayesian sparse graphical modeling",2012,

Geriatric assessment allows a proactive examination of patientsâ€™ overall health and function and provides an opportunity to broach issues beyond the initial purposes of the consultation.ObjectivesThe study aimed at investigating older patientsâ€™ information seeking behavior following a geriatric assessment and the kind of topics they wished to discuss, taking a variety of patient and health-related factors into account.Material and methodsA total of 317 patients (â‰¥â€‰70 years) underwent a geriatric assessment in 40 general practices. Subsequently they obtained a list of the problems uncovered and rated the relevance and information needs for each problem. Analyses consisted of determining the prevalence of information need for each health topic and identifying predictors in a mixed model (multilevel regression analysis).ResultsThe 317 patients presented with a median of 11 health problems (interquartile range, IQR 8â€“14) and 80â€‰% of the patients had information needs concerning only a few of the problems. High information needs were present for physical complaints and for vaccination issues. Little information seeking behavior was evident for unhealthy lifestyles, falls, limitations in daily activities and psychosocial problems. In the mixed model the personal relevance and the type of health problem both had a significant and independent effect on information seeking behavior.ConclusionA geriatric assessment generates a moderate need for information. It provides physicians with an opportunity to focus on those health problems that are important to older patients but not usually addressed in normal consultations. This particularly applies to limitations in daily activities and psychosocial problems.",2015,Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Gerontologie und Geriatrie
Forecasting Solar Irradiance from Time Series with Exogenous Information,"Solar irradiance forecast is the pivotal factor for power generation scheduling at photovoltaic (PV) power plants. To this end, we propose a framework to model solar irradiance that leverages both short-term dependency (several days) and dependency on time in the annual cycle. We focus on two classes of methods, autoregressive (AR), and autoregressive with exogenous variables (ARX), and investigate LASSO regression, and non-linear methods, including support vector regression (SVR) and long short-term memory (LSTM) as the underlying mechanism. Our experiments on data collected at a PV power plant for over five years show that considering external information such as weather on top of the historical solar irradiance data for longer period of time lowers the error of solar irradiance forecast.",2017,
The expressivity of turn-taking: Understanding children pragmatics by hybrid classifiers,"We analyze the effect of children age on pragmatic skills, i.e. on the way children manage the conversation dynamics. In particular, we focus exclusively on the turn-taking (who talks when and how much), reducing conversations as sequences of simple speech/silence periods. Employing a hybrid (generative + discriminative) classification framework, we demonstrate that such a simple signature is very informative, allowing to separate 22 â€œpre-Schoolâ€ conversations (between 3-4 years old children) and 24 â€œSchoolâ€ conversations (between 6-8 years old children) subjects, with 78% of accuracy. The framework exploits Steady Conversational Periods and Observed Influence Models as feature extractors, plus LASSO regression as feature selector and classifier. The generative nature of our method permits, as byproduct, to identify the pragmatic skills that better discriminate the two groups: no-tably, scholar children tend to have more frequent periods of sustained conversation, in a statistically significant way.",2013,2013 14th International Workshop on Image Analysis for Multimedia Interactive Services (WIAMIS)
Graphical Aids for Nonlinear Regression and Discriminant Analysis,"In nonlinear regression and discriminant analysis applications, graphical displays can facilitate understanding and communication with subject area researchers. For nonlinear regression, Cook-Weisberg confidence curves, Wald intervals, and contour plots of the loss function in the parameter space provide information about the certainty of estimates and also about estimates of functions of parameters. For linear and quadratic discriminant analysis models, scatterplots bordered by box plots aid transformation selection as the data analyst uses a GUI to quickly transform plot scales. A lasso plot tool provides a link from points (cases) in displays to a data worksheet with all values. Within-group histograms help outlier detection and to study the spread across groups. A failure of the equal covariance matrix assumption may be seen in within-group scatterplot matrices embellished with ellipses of concentration. Enhancements to canonical variable plots allow easy identification of misclassified cases.",1992,
The adaptive lasso in high-dimensional sparse heteroscedastic models,"In this paper we study the asymptotic properties of the adaptive Lasso estimate in high-dimensional sparse linear regression models with heteroscedastic errors. It is demonstrated that model selection properties and asymptotic normality of the selected parameters remain valid but with a suboptimal asymptotic variance. A weighted adaptive Lasso estimate is introduced and investigated. In particular, it is shown that the new estimate performs consistent model selection and that linear combinations of the estimates corresponding to the non-vanishing components are asymptotically normally distributed with a smaller variance than those obtained by the â€œclassicalâ€ adaptive Lasso.

Parameter estimation of multinomial logistic regression model using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO),"Regression modeling was used to describe the relationship between the response variable and one or more predictor variables. For a categorical response variable, the logistic regression would be more appropriate for this. It is not uncommon that we encounter a response variable with more than two categories. Hence, we end up modeling a multinomial logistic regression. The estimation of the parameters of the model was done using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Furthermore, we used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to further facilitate variable selection in the model. Case studies and simulations were studied using the LASSO model, and are implemented in R. We then implement the LASSO model to analyze the data of senior high school preferences by Public Junior High School and Islamic Junior High School students in Trenggalek Regency, East Java, Indonesia. The influencing factors from the model with LASSO were average score during the 8th semester, school type, fatherâ€™s occupation, motherâ€™s occupation, motherâ€™s last education, fatherâ€™s income, motherâ€™s income, and long term plan. The response variable was assumed to follow a multinomial distribution, with three levels. A random error was assumed to follow the normal distribution. There were two predictor variables, and various sample sizes were considered. The results showed that the LASSO estimates are similar to those from parametric estimation.Regression modeling was used to describe the relationship between the response variable and one or more predictor variables.

A novel predictive approach for GVHD after allogeneic SCT based on clinical variables and cytokine gene polymorphisms.,"Despite considerable advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), its prediction remains unresolved and depends mainly on clinical data. The aim of this study is to build a predictive model based on clinical variables and cytokine gene polymorphism for predicting acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) from the analysis of a large cohort of HLA-identical sibling donor allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) patients. A total of 25 SNPs in 12 cytokine genes were evaluated in 509 patients. Data were analyzed using a linear regression model and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The statistical model was constructed by randomly selecting 85% of cases (training set), and the predictive ability was confirmed based on the remaining 15% of cases (test set). Models including clinical and genetic variables (CG-M) predicted severe aGVHD significantly better than models including only clinical variables (C-M) or only genetic variables (G-M). For grades 3-4 aGVHD, the correct classification rates (CCR1) were: 100% for CG-M, 88% for G-M, and 50% for C-M. On the other hand, CG-M and G-M predicted extensive cGVHD better than C-M (CCR1: 80% vs. 66.7%, respectively). A risk score was calculated based on LASSO multivariate analyses. It was able to correctly stratify patients who developed grades 3-4 aGVHD (P < .001) and extensive cGVHD (P < .001). The novel predictive models proposed here improve the prediction of severe GVHD after allo-SCT. This approach could facilitate personalized risk-adapted clinical management of patients undergoing allo-SCT.",2018,Blood advances
A General Framework for Robust Testing and Confidence Regions in High-Dimensional Quantile Regression,"We propose a robust inferential procedure for assessing uncertainties of parameter estimation in high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension $p$ can grow exponentially fast with the sample size $n$. Our method combines the de-biasing technique with the composite quantile function to construct an estimator that is asymptotically normal. Hence it can be used to construct valid confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests. Our estimator is robust and does not require the existence of first or second moment of the noise distribution. It also preserves efficiency in the sense that the worst case efficiency loss is less than 30\% compared to the square-loss-based de-biased Lasso estimator. In many cases our estimator is close to or better than the latter, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Our de-biasing procedure does not require solving the $L_1$-penalized composite quantile regression. Instead, it allows for any first-stage estimator with desired convergence rate and empirical sparsity. The paper also provides new proof techniques for developing theoretical guarantees of inferential procedures with non-smooth loss functions. To establish the main results, we exploit the local curvature of the conditional expectation of composite quantile loss and apply empirical process theories to control the difference between empirical quantities and their conditional expectations. Our results are established under weaker assumptions compared to existing work on inference for high-dimensional quantile regression. Furthermore, we consider a high-dimensional simultaneous test for the regression parameters by applying the Gaussian approximation and multiplier bootstrap theories. We also study distributed learning and exploit the divide-and-conquer estimator to reduce computation complexity when the sample size is massive. Finally, we provide empirical results to verify the theory.",2014,arXiv: Machine Learning
The Reciprocal Bayesian LASSO,"A reciprocal LASSO (rLASSO) regularization employs a decreasing penalty function as opposed to conventional penalization methods that use increasing penalties on the coefficients, leading to stronger parsimony and superior model selection relative to traditional shrinkage methods. Here we consider a fully Bayesian formulation of the rLASSO problem, which is based on the observation that the rLASSO estimate for linear regression parameters can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior mode estimate when the regression parameters are assigned independent inverse Laplace priors. Bayesian inference from this posterior is possible using an expanded hierarchy motivated by a scale mixture of double Pareto or truncated normal distributions. On simulated and real datasets, we show that the Bayesian formulation outperforms its classical cousin in estimation, prediction, and variable selection across a wide range of scenarios while offering the advantage of posterior inference. Finally, we discuss other variants of this new approach and provide a unified framework for variable selection using flexible reciprocal penalties. All methods described in this paper are publicly available as an R package at: this https URL.",2020,arXiv: Methodology
Making choices that matter â€“ Use of statistical regularization in species distribution modelling for identification of climatic indicators â€“ A case study with Mikania micrantha Kunth in India,"Abstract Biological invasions by alien non-indigenous species are one of the major problems of the present era which impose massive environmental and socio-economic costs. In India about 40% of the floral species have long been recognized to be aliens, but the need for priority conservation efforts has only been felt since the turn of the century. Thus, it is now of utmost importance to predict the potential distribution of invasive alien species and identify suitable environmental conditions that allow the species to spread rapidly. The invasive plant Mikania micrantha was chosen as the test species. Native occurrence records (longitude and latitude) were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). For Indian occurrences, GBIF records were supplemented with occurrences from herbaria label data and information gathered from published literature. Nineteen climatic variables were obtained from World-Clim databse. To predict the potential distribution, species distribution models (SDMs) were built by using logistic regression and the climatic variables were chosen by using two cross-validated regularization methods induced by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) and the ridge penalty function. This approach has twofold benefits; it deals with the multicollinearity problem efficiently and selects the raw environmental covariates. F Î² -score was utilized to measure the modelsâ€™ performance. Combining the data from both native and alien ranges, seven environmental predictors were selected using four different background choices. Using lasso penalty, mean diurnal range (mean of monthly (max temp â€“ min temp)) (BIO2), Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (Ã—100) (BIO3), Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6) (BIO7), Precipitation of Wettest Month (BIO13), Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) (BIO15) and Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (BIO18) were found to be strong correlates for all four backgrounds. The predicted probabilities from the model containing these seven selected variables, demonstrated higher invasion risk in the central part of India than the model containing all the predictors. Accurate analysis of present distributions and effective predictive modelling of future distributions of invasive alien species is of vital importance for the early detection of the invasion and rapid remedial actions downstream. This study may aid in the adoption of management initiatives like early detection and rapid response. This could result in identifying both new populations and established populations to be prioritized for management.",2019,Ecological Indicators
Estimation of High-Dimensional Seemingly Unrelated Regression Models,"In this paper, we investigate seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models that allow the number of equations (N) to be large, and to be comparable to the number of the observations in each equation (T). It is well known in the literature that the conventional SUR estimator, for example, the generalized least squares (GLS) estimator of Zellner (1962) does not perform well. As the main contribution of the paper, we propose a new feasible GLS estimator called the feasible graphical lasso (FGLasso) estimator. For a feasible implementation of the GLS estimator, we use the graphical lasso estimation of the precision matrix (the inverse of the covariance matrix of the equation system errors) assuming that the underlying unknown precision matrix is sparse. We derive asymptotic theories of the new estimator and investigate its finite sample properties via Monte-Carlo simulations.",2018,arXiv: Econometrics
"Differentially Private Feature Selection via Stability Arguments, and the Robustness of the Lasso","We design differentially private algorithms for statistical model selection. Given a data set and a large, discrete collection of â€œmodelsâ€, each of which is a family of probability distributions, the goal is to determine the model that best â€œfitsâ€ the data. This is a basic problem in many areas of statistics and machine learning. We consider settings in which there is a well-defined answer, in the following sense: Suppose that there is a nonprivate model selection proceduref which is the reference to which we compare our performance. Our differentially private algorithms output the correct valuef(D) wheneverf is stable on the input data setD. We work with two notions, perturbation stability and subsampling stability. We give two classes of results: generic ones, that apply to any function with discrete output set; and specific algorithms for the problem of sparse linear regression. The algorithms we describe are efficient and in some cases match the optimal nonprivate asymptotic sample complexity. Our algorithms for sparse linear regression require analyzing the stability properties of the popular LASSO estimator. We give sufficient conditions for the LASSO estimator to be robust to small changes in the data set, and show that these conditions hold with high probability under essentially the same stochastic assumptions that are used in the literature to analyze convergence of the LASSO.",2013,
"Compound Poisson point processes, concentration and oracle inequalities","This note aims at presenting several new theoretical results for the compound Poisson point process, which follows the work of Zhang et al. (Insur. Math. Econ. 59:325â€“336, 2014). The first part provides a new characterization for a discrete compound Poisson point process (proposed by AczÃ©l (Acta Math. Hung. 3(3):219â€“224, 1952)), it extends the characterization of the Poisson point process given by Copeland and Regan (Ann. Math. 37:357â€“362, 1936). Next, we derive some concentration inequalities for discrete compound Poisson point process (negative binomial random variable with unknown dispersion is a significant example). These concentration inequalities are potentially useful in count data regression. We give an application in the weighted Lasso penalized negative binomial regressions whose KKT conditions of penalized likelihood hold with high probability and then we derive non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for a weighted Lasso estimator.",2019,Journal of Inequalities and Applications
Applying Penalized Binary Logistic Regression with Correlation Based Elastic Net for Variables Selection,"Reduction of the high dimensional classification using penalized logistic regression is one of the challenges in applying binary logistic regression. The applied penalized method, correlation based elastic penalty (CBEP), was used to overcome the limitation of LASSO and elastic net in variable selection when there are perfect correlation among explanatory variables. The performance of the CBEP was demonstrated through its application in analyzing two well-known high dimensional binary classification data sets. The CBEP provided superior classification performance and variable selection compared with other existing penalized methods. It is a reliable penalized method in binary logistic regression.",2015,Journal of Modern Applied Statistical Methods
Simultaneous estimation and variable selection in median regression using Lasso-type penalty,"We consider the median regression with a LASSO-type penalty term for variable selection. With the fixed number of variables in regression model, a two-stage method is proposed for simultaneous estimation and variable selection where the degree of penalty is adaptively chosen. A Bayesian information criterion type approach is proposed and used to obtain a data-driven procedure which is proved to automatically select asymptotically optimal tuning parameters. It is shown that the resultant estimator achieves the so-called oracle property. The combination of the median regression and LASSO penalty is computationally easy to implement via the standard linear programming. A random perturbation scheme can be made use of to get simple estimator of the standard error. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed method. We illustrate the methodology with a real example.",2010,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
Extreme Rainfall Prediction using Bayesian Quantile Regression in Statistical Downscaling Modeling,"Abstract Statistical Downscaling (SD) is a model that uses satellite data from General Circulation Models (GCM), which in climatology are very useful in predicting climate for the next few decades. GCM data is generally ill-conditioned, which is high dimension and multicollinearity, so a special technique is needed to handle this poorly conditioned. One of the variable selection techniques and handling of multicollinearity which is currently highly developed is regularization techniques including Adaptive Lasso, where selective parameters are adaptive, which can differ for each regression coefficient. Until now, predictions of extreme rainfall in Indonesia have not used Adaptive Lasso in SD modeling. This paper aims to predict the amount of rainfall (in millimeters) at moderate extreme (quantile 0.75) and high extreme rainfall (quantile 0.9 da 0.95) and handling poorly conditioned GCM data with Adaptive Lasso techniques and building predictive models of local rainfall by utilizing GCM data using the Bayes quantile regression model. Response in the form of monthly rainfall at Indramayu district, West Java Indonesia, and 49 explanatory variables in the form of GCM precipitation data in the period January 1981 - December 2013, which handled multicollinearity and variable selection using the Adaptive Lasso. The results are very satisfying with correlation between predicted and real data is above 0.91 for and the RMSEP is less than 50.",2019,Procedia Computer Science
A Long Non-coding RNA Signature to Improve Prognostic Prediction of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,"Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most aggressive solid malignant tumors worldwide. Increasing investigations demonstrate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression is abnormally dysregulated in cancers. It is crucial to identify and predict the prognosis of patients for the selection of further therapeutic treatment. Methods: PDAC lncRNAs abundance profiles were used to establish a signature that could better predict the prognosis of PDAC patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model was applied to establish a multi-lncRNA signature in the TCGA training cohort (N = 107). The signature was then validated in a TCGA validation cohort (N = 70) and another independent Fudan cohort (N = 46). Results: A five-lncRNA signature was constructed and it was significantly related to the overall survival (OS), either in the training or validation cohorts. Through the subgroup and Cox regression analyses, the signature was proven to be independent of other clinic-pathologic parameters. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis also indicated that our signature had a better predictive capacity of PDAC prognosis. Furthermore, ClueGO and CluePedia analyses showed that a number of cancer-related and drug response pathways were enriched in high risk groups. Conclusions: Identifying the five-lncRNA signature (RP11-159F24.5, RP11-744N12.2, RP11-388M20.1, RP11-356C4.5, CTC-459F4.9) may provide insight into personalized prognosis prediction and new therapies for PDAC patients.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Variable selection when confronted with missing data,"Variable selection is a common problem in linear regression. Stepwise methods, such as forward selection, are popular and are easily available in most statistical packages. The models selected by these methods have a number of drawbacks: they are often unstable, with changes in the set of variable selected due to small changes in the data, and they provide upwardly biased regression coefficient estimates. Recently proposed methods, such as the lasso, provide accurate predictions via a parsimonious, interpretable model. 
Missing data values are also a common problem, especially in longitudinal studies. One approach to account for missing data is multiple imputation. The simulation studies were conducted comparing the lasso to standard variable selection methods under different missing data conditions, including the percentage of missing values and the missing data mechanism. Under missing at random mechanisms, missing data were created at the 25 and 50 percent levels with two types of regression parameters, one containing large effects and one containing several small, but nonzero, effects. Five correlation structures were used in generating the data: independent, autoregressive with correlation 0.25 and 0.50, and equicorrelated again with correlation 0.25 and 0.50. Three different missing data mechanisms were used to create the missing data: linear, convex and sinister. 
Least angle regression performed well under all conditions when the true regression parameter vector contained large effects, with its dominance increasing as the correlation between the predictor variables increased. This is consistent with complete data simulations studies suggesting the lasso performed poorly in situations where the true beta vector contained small, nonzero effects. When the true beta vector contained small, nonzero effects, the performance of the variable selection methods considered was situation dependent. 
Ordinary least squares had superior performance in terms confidence interval coverage under the independent correlation structure and with correlated data when the true regression parameter vector consists of small, nonzero effects. A variety of methods performed well when the regression parameter vector consisted of large effects and the predictor variables were correlated depending on the missing data situation.",2006,
Network-Scale Traffic Modeling and Forecasting with Graphical Lasso and Neural Networks,"Traffic flow forecasting, especially the short-term case, is an important topic in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This paper does a lot of research on network-scale modeling and forecasting of short-term traffic flows. Firstly, we propose the concepts of single-link and multi-link models of traffic flow forecasting. Secondly, we construct four prediction models by combining the two models with single-task learning and multi-task learning. The combination of the multi-link model and multi-task learning not only improves the experimental efficiency but also the prediction accuracy. Moreover, a new multi-link single-task approach that combines graphical lasso (GL) with neural network (NN) is proposed. GL provides a general methodology for solving problems involving lots of variables. Using L1 regularization, GL builds a sparse graphical model making use of the sparse inverse covariance matrix. In addition, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a classic regression algorithm in Bayesian machine learning. Although there is wide research on GPR, there are few applications of GPR in traffic flow forecasting. In this paper, we apply GPR to traffic flow forecasting and show its potential. Through sufficient experiments, we compare all of the proposed approaches and make an overall assessment at last.",2012,arXiv: Learning
Association of leukocyte DNA methylation changes with dietary folate and alcohol intake in the EPIC study,"BackgroundThere is increasing evidence that folate, an important component of one-carbon metabolism, modulates the epigenome. Alcohol, which can disrupt folate absorption, is also known to affect the epigenome. We investigated the association of dietary folate and alcohol intake on leukocyte DNA methylation levels in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Leukocyte genome-wide DNA methylation profiles on approximately 450,000 CpG sites were acquired with Illumina HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip measured among 450 women control participants of a case-control study on breast cancer nested within the EPIC cohort. After data preprocessing using surrogate variable analysis to reduce systematic variation, associations of DNA methylation with dietary folate and alcohol intake, assessed with dietary questionnaires, were investigated using CpG site-specific linear models. Specific regions of the methylome were explored using differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis and fused lasso (FL) regressions. The DMR analysis combined results from the feature-specific analysis for a specific chromosome and using distances between features as weights whereas FL regression combined two penalties to encourage sparsity of single features and the difference between two consecutive features.ResultsAfter correction for multiple testing, intake of dietary folate was not associated with methylation level at any DNA methylation site, while weak associations were observed between alcohol intake and methylation level at CpG sites cg03199996 and cg07382687, with qvalÂ =Â 0.029 and qvalÂ =Â 0.048, respectively. Interestingly, the DMR analysis revealed a total of 24 and 90 regions associated with dietary folate and alcohol, respectively. For alcohol intake, 6 of the 15 most significant DMRs were identified through FL.ConclusionsAlcohol intake was associated with methylation levels at two CpG sites. Evidence from DMR and FL analyses indicated that dietary folate and alcohol intake may be associated with genomic regions with tumor suppressor activity such as the GSDMD and HOXA5 genes. These results were in line with the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the association between folate and alcohol, although further studies are warranted to clarify the importance of these mechanisms in cancer.",2019,Clinical Epigenetics
Rank-based group variable selection,"A robust rank-based estimator for variable selection in linear models, with grouped predictors, is studied. The proposed estimation procedure extends the existing rank-based variable selection [Johnson, B.A., and Peng, L.

The resulting estimator is robust to contamination or deviations in both the response and the design space.The Oracle property and asymptotic normality of the estimator are established under some regularity conditions. Simulation studies reveal that the proposed method performs better than the existing rank-based methods [Johnson, B.A., and Peng, L.
