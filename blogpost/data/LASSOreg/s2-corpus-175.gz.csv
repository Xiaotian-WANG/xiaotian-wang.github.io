Variable Selection Methods with Applications to Crime Prediction,"There have been several variable selection techniques presented in the literature and coursework. However, to date there is no agreed upon â€œbestâ€ approach. In this thesis, we apply several different variable selection techniques to a 1990 United States crime database to determine 1) which set of socio-economic and demographic factors are most predictive of violent crime, and 2) which model selection technique produces the best out of sample predictions. The selected cleaned data set was split into a training and test sets and stepwise (forÂ­ ward, backward, both forward and backward simultaneously), lasso, elastic net, princiÂ­ pal component regression (PCR), best random subset selection (BRSS), regression trees (full, pruning, bagging, random forest) and count (aggregation of multiple methods) were fit to the training data and then applied to the test data. Fit criteria we used included AIC, BIC, multiple R2, adjusted R2, and mean squared error (MSE). Summary tables and figÂ­ ures detailing which factors were associated with violent crime were constructed as well as tables/figures assessing the performance of the different variable selection techniques. Variables which were associated with violent crime rates across different methods of selection included measures of employment, urbanization/density, income, poverty, ethnicity and family structure. In terms of model selection techniques, the method that produced the highest out of sample R2 was BRSS which also produced an unbiased asÂ­ sessment of model fit when applied to test data. Lasso and elastic net performed similarly, but not quite as well as BRSS. The other methods performed somewhat worse. Predicting crime rates can be difficult, but by using these variable selection techÂ­ niques we found a small subset of variables which seemed to be most associated with",2016,
Infinite mixture-of-experts model for sparse survival regression with application to breast cancer,"BackgroundWe present an infinite mixture-of-experts model to find an unknown number of sub-groups within a given patient cohort based on survival analysis. The effect of patient features on survival is modeled using the Coxâ€™s proportionality hazards model which yields a non-standard regression component. The model is able to find key explanatory factors (chosen from main effects and higher-order interactions) for each sub-group by enforcing sparsity on the regression coefficients via the Bayesian Group-Lasso.ResultsSimulated examples justify the need of such an elaborate framework for identifying sub-groups along with their key characteristics versus other simpler models. When applied to a breast-cancer dataset consisting of survival times and protein expression levels of patients, it results in identifying two distinct sub-groups with different survival patterns (low-risk and high-risk) along with the respective sets of compound markers.ConclusionsThe unified framework presented here, combining elements of cluster and feature detection for survival analysis, is clearly a powerful tool for analyzing survival patterns within a patient group. The model also demonstrates the feasibility of analyzing complex interactions which can contribute to definition of novel prognostic compound markers.",2010,BMC Bioinformatics
Regression methods for survival and multistate models,"REGRESSION METHODS FOR SURVIVAL AND MULTI STATE MODELS Farida Mostajabi June 23, 2011 A common research interest in medical, biological, and engineering research is determining whether certain independent variables are correlated with the survival or failure times. Standard statistical techniques cannot usually be applied for failure-time data due to the lack of complete data or in other word, due to censoring. From a statistical perspective, the study of time to event data is even more challenging when further complexities such as high dimensionality or multivariablity is added to the model. In this dissertation, we consider the predicating patient survival from proteomic profile of patient serum using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) data of non-small cell lung cancer patients. Due to much larger dimension of features in a mass spectrum compared to the study sample size, traditional linear regression modeling of survival times with high number of proteomic features is not feasible. Hence, we consider latent factor and regularized/penalized methods for fitting such models in order to predict patient survival from the mass spectrometry features. Extensive numerical studies involving both simulated as well as real mass spectrometry data are used to compare four popular regression methods, namely, partial least squares (PLS), sparse partial least square (SPLS), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and elastic net regularization, on processed spectra. Right censoring is handled",2011,
Association of Medical Students' Reports of Interactions with the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Industries and Medical School Policies and Characteristics: A Cross-Sectional Study,"BACKGROUND
Professional societies use metrics to evaluate medical schools' policies regarding interactions of students and faculty with the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. We compared these metrics and determined which US medical schools' industry interaction policies were associated with student behaviors.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
Using survey responses from a national sample of 1,610 US medical students, we compared their reported industry interactions with their schools' American Medical Student Association (AMSA) PharmFree Scorecard and average Institute on Medicine as a Profession (IMAP) Conflicts of Interest Policy Database score. We used hierarchical logistic regression models to determine the association between policies and students' gift acceptance, interactions with marketing representatives, and perceived adequacy of faculty-industry separation. We adjusted for year in training, medical school size, and level of US National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. We used LASSO regression models to identify specific policies associated with the outcomes. We found that IMAP and AMSA scores had similar median values (1.75 [interquartile range 1.50-2.00] versus 1.77 [1.50-2.18], adjusted to compare scores on the same scale). Scores on AMSA and IMAP shared policy dimensions were not closely correlated (gift policies, r = 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.44; marketing representative access policies, r = 0.51, 95% CI 0.36-0.63). Students from schools with the most stringent industry interaction policies were less likely to report receiving gifts (AMSA score, odds ratio [OR]: 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.72; IMAP score, OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.19-1.04) and less likely to interact with marketing representatives (AMSA score, OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.69; IMAP score, OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.95) than students from schools with the lowest ranked policy scores. The association became nonsignificant when fully adjusted for NIH funding level, whereas adjusting for year of education, size of school, and publicly versus privately funded school did not alter the association. Policies limiting gifts, meals, and speaking bureaus were associated with students reporting having not received gifts and having not interacted with marketing representatives. Policy dimensions reflecting the regulation of industry involvement in educational activities (e.g., continuing medical education, travel compensation, and scholarships) were associated with perceived separation between faculty and industry. The study is limited by potential for recall bias and the cross-sectional nature of the survey, as school curricula and industry interaction policies may have changed since the time of the survey administration and study analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
As medical schools review policies regulating medical students' industry interactions, limitations on receipt of gifts and meals and participation of faculty in speaking bureaus should be emphasized, and policy makers should pay greater attention to less research-intensive institutions.

The MIAmaxent R package: Variable transformation and model selection for species distribution models,"The widely used ""Maxent"" software for modeling species distributions from presence-only data (Phillips et al., Ecological Modelling, 190, 2006, 231) tends to produce models with high-predictive performance but low-ecological interpretability, and implications of Maxent's statistical approach to variable transformation, model fitting, and model selection remain underappreciated. In particular, Maxent's approach to model selection through lasso regularization has been shown to give less parsimonious distribution models-that is, models which are more complex but not necessarily predictively better-than subset selection. In this paper, we introduce the MIAmaxent R package, which provides a statistical approach to modeling species distributions similar to Maxent's, but with subset selection instead of lasso regularization. The simpler models typically produced by subset selection are ecologically more interpretable, and making distribution models more grounded in ecological theory is a fundamental motivation for using MIAmaxent. To that end, the package executes variable transformation based on expected occurrence-environment relationships and contains tools for exploring data and interrogating models in light of knowledge of the modeled system. Additionally, MIAmaxent implements two different kinds of model fitting: maximum entropy fitting for presence-only data and logistic regression (GLM) for presence-absence data. Unlike Maxent, MIAmaxent decouples variable transformation, model fitting, and model selection, which facilitates methodological comparisons and gives the modeler greater flexibility when choosing a statistical approach to a given distribution modeling problem.",2019,Ecology and Evolution
A Review of Linear Regression and some Basic Proofs for Lasso,"The goal of this paper is to do some basic proofs for lasso and have a deep understanding of linear regression. In this paper, firstly I give a review of methods in linear regression, and most concerns with the method of lasso. Lasso for â€˜least absolute shrinkage and selection operatorâ€™ is a regularized version of method adds a constraint which uses norm less or equal to a given value t. By doing so, some predictor coefficients would be shrank and some others might be set to 0. We can attain good interpretation and prediction accuracy by using lasso method. Secondly, I provide some basic proofs for lasso, which would be very helpful in understanding lasso. Additionally, some geometric graphs are also given and one example is illustrated. 1 L",2010,
"Genomic Prediction of 16 Complex Disease Risks Including Heart Attack, Diabetes, Breast and Prostate Cancer","We construct risk predictors using polygenic scores (PGS) computed from common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for a number of complex disease conditions, using L1-penalized regression (also known as LASSO) on case-control data from UK Biobank. Among the disease conditions studied are Hypothyroidism, (Resistant) Hypertension, Type 1 and 2 Diabetes, Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Testicular Cancer, Gallstones, Glaucoma, Gout, Atrial Fibrillation, High Cholesterol, Asthma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Malignant Melanoma, and Heart Attack. We obtain values for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) in the range ~0.58â€“0.71 using SNP data alone. Substantially higher predictor AUCs are obtained when incorporating additional variables such as age and sex. Some SNP predictors alone are sufficient to identify outliers (e.g., in the 99th percentile of polygenic score, or PGS) with 3â€“8 times higher risk than typical individuals. We validate predictors out-of-sample using the eMERGE dataset, and also with different ancestry subgroups within the UK Biobank population. Our results indicate that substantial improvements in predictive power are attainable using training sets with larger case populations. We anticipate rapid improvement in genomic prediction as more case-control data become available for analysis.",2019,Scientific Reports
Bin-based model construction and analytical strategies for dissecting complex traits with chromosome segment substitution lines,"Chromosome segment substitution lines have been created in several experimental models, including many plant and animal species, and are useful tools for the genetic analysis and mapping of complex traits. The traditional t-test is usually applied to identify a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that is contained within a chromosome segment to estimate the QTLâ€™s effect. However, current methods cannot uncover the entire genetic structure of complex traits. For example, current methods cannot distinguish between main effects and epistatic effects. In this paper, a linear epistatic model was constructed to dissect complex traits. First, all the long substituted segments were divided into overlapping small bins, and each small bin was considered a unique independent variable. The genetic model for complex traits was then constructed. When considering all the possible main effects and epistatic effects, the dimensions of the linear model can become extremely high. Therefore, variable selection via stepwise regression (Bin-REG) was proposed for the epistatic QTL analysis in the present study. Furthermore, we tested the feasibility of using the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) algorithm to estimate epistatic effects, examined the fully Bayesian SSVS (stochastic search variable selection) approach, tested the empirical Bayes (E-BAYES) method, and evaluated the penalized likelihood (PENAL) method for mapping epistatic QTLs. Simulation studies suggested that all of the above methods, excluding the LASSO and PENAL approaches, performed satisfactorily. The Bin-REG method appears to outperform all other methods in terms of estimating positions and effects.",2012,Chinese Science Bulletin
Safe Bayesian Linear Regression,"We study generalized Bayesian inference under misspecification, i.e. when the model is `wrong but useful'. Generalized Bayes equips the likelihood with a learning rate Î·. We show that for generalized linear models (GLMs), Î·-generalized Bayes concentrates around the best approximation of the truth within the model for specific Î·â‰ 1, even under severely misspecified noise, as long as the tails of the true distribution are exponential. We then derive MCMC samplers for generalized Bayesian lasso and logistic regression, and give examples of both simulated and real-world data in which generalized Bayes outperforms standard Bayes by a vast margin.",2019,
Construction of a novel gene-based model for prognosis prediction of clear cell renal cell carcinoma,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) comprises the majority of kidney cancer death worldwide, whose incidence and mortality are not promising. Identifying ideal biomarkers to construct a more accurate prognostic model than conventional clinical parameters is crucial. Raw count of RNA-sequencing data and clinicopathological data were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Tumor samples were divided into two sets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in the whole set and prognosis-related genes were identified from the training set. Their common genes were used in LASSO and best subset regression which were performed to identify the best prognostic 5 genes. The gene-based risk score was developed based on the Cox coefficient of the individual gene. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplanâ€“Meier (KM) survival analysis were used to assess its prognostic power. GSE29609 dataset from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database was used to validate the signature. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were performed to screen independent prognostic parameters to construct a nomogram. The predictive power of the nomogram was revealed by time-dependent ROC curves and the calibration plot and verified in the validation set. Finally, Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs and 5 novel genes were performed to suggest the potential biological pathways. PADI1, ATP6V0D2, DPP6, C9orf135 and PLG were screened to be significantly related to the prognosis of ccRCC patients. The risk score effectively stratified the patients into high-risk group with poor overall survival (OS) based on survival analysis. AJCC-stage, age, recurrence and risk score were regarded as independent prognostic parameters by Cox regression analysis and were used to construct a nomogram. Time-dependent ROC curves showed the nomogram performed best in 1-, 3- and 5-year survival predictions compared with AJCC-stage and risk score in validation sets. The calibration plot showed good agreement of the nomogram between predicted and observed outcomes. Functional enrichment analysis suggested several enriched biological pathways related to cancer. In our study, we constructed a gene-based model integrating clinical prognostic parameters to predict prognosis of ccRCC well, which might provide a reliable prognosis assessment tool for clinician and aid treatment decision-making in the clinic.",2020,Cancer Cell International
Development and Validation of a microRNA Panel to Differentiate between Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Controls.,"OBJECTIVE
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate genes and are both biomarkers and mediators of disease. We used small RNA (sRNA) sequencing and machine learning methodology to develop a miRNA panel to reliably differentiate between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and control subjects.


METHODS
Plasma samples from 167 RA and 91 control subjects frequency-matched for age, race and sex were used for sRNA sequencing. TIGER was used to analyze miRNAs. DESeq2 and random forest analyses were used to identify a prioritized list of miRNAs differentially expressed in patients with RA. Prioritized miRNAs were validated by quantitative PCR, and lasso and logistic regression were used to select the final panel of six miRNAs that best differentiated RA from controls. The panel was validated in a separate cohort of 12 SLE, 32 RA and 32 control subjects. Panel efficacy was assessed by area under the receiver operative characteristic curve (AUC) analyses.


RESULTS
The final panel included miR-22-3p, miR-24-3p, miR-96-5p, miR-134-5p, miR-140-3p, and miR- 627-5p. The panel differentiated RA from control subjects in discovery (AUC=0.81) and validation cohorts (AUC=0.71), seronegative RA (AUC=0.84), RA remission (AUC=0.85), and SLE patients (AUC=0.80) versus controls. Pathway analysis showed upstream regulators and targets of panel miRNAs are associated with pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis.


CONCLUSION
A miRNA panel identified by a bioinformatic approach differentiated between RA or SLE patients and control subjects. The panel may represent an autoimmunity signature, perhaps related to inflammatory arthritis, which is not dependent on active disease or seropositivity.",2019,The Journal of rheumatology
Genomic predictions of breeding values in a cloned Eucalyptus globulus population in Chile,"In Chile, an intensive Eucalyptus globulus clonal selection program is being carried out to increase forest productivity for pulp production. A breeding population was used to investigate the predicted ability of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for genomic selection (GS). A total of 310 clones from 53 families were used. Stem volume and wood density were measured on all clones. Trees were genotyped at 12Â K polymorphic markers using the EUChip60K genotype array. Genomic best linear unbiased prediction, Bayesian lasso regression, Bayes B, and Bayes C models were used to predict genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV). For cross-validation, 260 individuals were sampled for model training and 50 individuals for model validation, using 2 folds and 10 replications each. The average predictive ability estimates for wood density and stem volume across the models were 0.58 and 0.75, respectively. The average rank correlations were 0.59 and 0.71, respectively. Models produced very similar bias for both traits. When clones were ranked based on their GEBV, models had similar phenotypic mean for the top 10% of the clones. The predicted ability of markers will likely decrease if the models are used to predict GEBV of new material coming from the breeding program, because of a different markerâ€“trait phase introduced by recombination. The results should be validated with larger populations and across two generations before routine applications of GS in E. globulus. We suggest that GS is a viable strategy to accelerate clonal selection program of E. globulus in Chile.",2017,Tree Genetics & Genomes

Improving FMRI prediction of purchases with Penalized Discriminant Analyses,"Despite growing interest in applying machine learning algorithms to brain data, few studies have gone beyond classifying sensory input to using brain activity to directly predicting behavioral output. With spatial resolution on the order of millimeters and temporal resolution on the order of seconds, functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) data is a promising candidate for such applications. However, FMRI data's low signal-to-noise ratio, high dimensionality, and extensive spatial and temporal correlations present formidable analytic challenges. Here, we apply di erent preprocessing and machine learning algorithms to a previously-acquired dataset [23] to examine the ability of FMRI activation in three regions the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and insula to predict purchasing. Our goal was to increase both classi cation rates and spatiotemporal interpretability. To this end, penalized discriminant analyses based on the LASSO, Elastic Net, and Univariate Soft Thresholding enabled automatic selection of correlated subsets of variables. Relative to logistic regression and linear discriminant analyses these methods provided both better classi cation rates and interpretability. These ndings validate temporal inferences about which brain regions utilize which types of information in subsequent purchasing decisions. Penalized discriminant analyses methods may improve future attempts to use FMRI data to make single-trial behavioral predictions.",2007,
Fast Identification of Encrypted Traffic via Large-Scale Sparse Screening,"Encrypted traffic identification has great significance to regulate illegal data, detect network attacks and protect users' information. Here we propose a novel approach to fast identify encrypted traffic via large-scale sparse screening. We investigate randomness features using Lasso regression to select the most relevant features. To make it more efficient to solve large-scale problems, we employ Enhanced Dual Polytope Projections(EDPP) screening rule to remove irrelevant features quickly. The identification is performed with the help of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) because of its better identification and faster speed. Experimental results show that the method is efficient and effective in encrypted traffic identification.",2017,2017 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big Data (CBD)
Quantile regression and variable selection of partial linear single-index model,"Partial linear single-index model (PLSIM) is a flexible and applicable model when investigating the underlying relationship between the response and the multivariate covariates. Most previous studies on PLSIM concentrated on mean regression, based on least square or likelihood approach. In contrast to this method, in this paper, we propose minimizing average check loss estimation (MACLE) procedure to conduct quantile regression of PLSIM. We construct an initial consistent quantile regression estimator of the parametric part base multi-dimensional kernels, and further promote the estimation efficiency to the optimal rate. We discuss the optimal bandwidth selection method and establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed MACLE estimators. Furthermore, we consider an adaptive lasso penalized variable selection method and establish its oracle property. Simulation studies with various distributed error and a real data analysis are conducted to show the promise of our proposed methods.",2015,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
Censored quantile regression processes under dependence and penalization,"We consider quantile regression processes from censored data under dependent data structures and derive a uniform Bahadur representation for those processes. We also consider cases where the dimension of the parameter in the quantile regression model is large. It is demonstrated that traditional penalized estimators such as the adaptive lasso yield sub-optimal rates if the coecients of the quantile regression cross zero. New penalization techniques are introduced which are able to deal with specic problems of censored data and yield estimates with an optimal rate. In contrast to most of the literature, the asymptotic analysis does not require the assumption of independent observations, but is based on rather weak assumptions, which are satised for many",2012,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Polygenic scores using summary statistics via penalized regression,"Polygenic scores (PGS) summarize the genetic contribution of a personâ€™s genotype to a disease or phenotype. They are useful in a wide variety of analyses of genetic data. Many possible ways of calculating polygenic scores have been proposed, and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate information available in published summary statistics. As there is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in summary statistics, a pertinent question is whether we can make use of LD information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To answer this question we proposed a method for constructing PGS using summary statistics and a reference panel in a penalized regression framework, which we called lassosum. We also proposed a general method for choosing the value of the tuning parameter in the absence of validation data. Our simulation results suggested that lassosum is faster and more robust than other similar methods in most scenarios. We also found that accounting for LD with a reference panel is beneficial only when the signals from the data are strong. In the presence of summary statistics from a large number of SNPs, clumping may both enhance or decrease the performance of standard PGS, although its effects on lassosum is attenuated. lassosum combined with pre-filtering by clumping appears to be a robust and reliable option for calculating predictive PGS.",2016,bioRxiv
Gene regulatory network inference using sparse probabilistic models,"The main task of systems biology is to uncover mechanisms that regulate complex processes that take place in biological cells, especially the mechanisms of gene regulation. This project aims to identify gene regulatory interactions taking place in the early development of neural tube. Solutions proposed in this work for identification of transcription factors and their target genes are mostly based on Bayesian sparse linear models. Sparse linear regression is used to predict gene expression given a set of transcription factor expressions. Even though transcriptional regulation mechanisms are frequently non-linear, a sparse linear regression model succeeds in identifying some of the transcription factors that are already known to play role in the studied biological processes. The probabilistic sparse model is compared to its frequentist equivalent, the lasso. Both algorithms are evaluated on neural tube development data and Bayesian model produces superior results. The probabilistic sparse linear model is also extended to take into account non-linear interactions between transcription factors. A simple interaction model is presented and it is integrated into the probabilistic sparse linear model. The resulting model is a novel method to incorporate non-linearity into linear regression. Variational approximate inference algorithm is derived for the extended model with transcription factor interactions. This model is then applied to a subset of potentially important transcription factors and it succeeds to find a very sparse solution. Again, the results from the extended model succeed to identify transcription factors that seem to have important role. Both probabilistic models for gene regulation provide a set of straightforwardly testable predictions of potentially interesting transcription factors.",2011,
The quantile process under random censoring D iscussion P aper,"In this paper we discuss the asymptotical properties of quantile processes under random censoring. In contrast to most work in this area we prove weak convergence of an appropriately standardized quantile process under the assumption that the quantile regression model is only linear in the region, where the process is investigated. Additionally, we also discuss properties of the quantile process in sparse regression models including quantile processes obtained from the Lasso and adaptive Lasso. The results are derived by a combination of modern empirical process theory, classical martingale methods and a recent result of Kato (2009).",2012,
Sup-norm convergence rate and sign concentration property of Lasso and Dantzig estimators,We derive the l! convergence rate simultaneously for Lasso and Dantzig estimators in a high-dimensional linear regression model under a mutual coherence assumption on the Gram matrix of the design and two di! erent assumptions on the noise: Gaussian noise and general noise with finite variance. Then we prove that simultaneously the thresholded Lasso and Dantzig estimators with a proper choice of the threshold enjoy a sign concentration property provided that the non-zero components of the target vector are not too small.,2008,Electronic Journal of Statistics
