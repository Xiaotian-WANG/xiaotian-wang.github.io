â€œPractice makes perfect?â€ white matter microstructural characteristic predicts the degree of improvement in within-trial conflict processing across two weeks,"Several studies have investigated the trait-like characteristics of conflict processing at different levels. Our study extends these findings by reporting a practice-based improvement in within-trial conflict processing across two sessions. Eighty-three participants performed the same flanker task on two occasions 2Â weeks apart. A subset of 37 subjects also underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scanning the day before the first behavioral task. Despite the trait-like characteristics of conflict processing, within-trial conflict processing in the second behavioral session was significantly shorter than that in the first session, indicating a practice-based improvement in conflict processing. Furthermore, changes in within-trial conflict processing across the two sessions exhibited significant individual differences. Tract-based spatial statistics revealed that the improvement across two sessions was related to the axial diffusivity values in white matter regions, including the body and splenium of the corpus callosum, right superior and posterior corona radiate, and right superior longitudinal fasciculus. Subsequently, lasso regression with leave-one-out cross validation was used to assess the predictive ability of white matter microstructural characteristics in significant regions. The results showed that 61% of individual variability in the improvement in the within-trial conflict processing could be explained by variations in the axial diffusivity values in the four significant regions and the within-trial conflict processing in the first session. These results suggest that axonal morphology in the white tracts connecting conflict-related regions predicts the degree of within-trial conflict processing improvement across two sessions.",2018,Brain Imaging and Behavior
High-dimensional regression adjustments in randomized experiments.,"We study the problem of treatment effect estimation in randomized experiments with high-dimensional covariate information and show that essentially any risk-consistent regression adjustment can be used to obtain efficient estimates of the average treatment effect. Our results considerably extend the range of settings where high-dimensional regression adjustments are guaranteed to provide valid inference about the population average treatment effect. We then propose cross-estimation, a simple method for obtaining finite-sample-unbiased treatment effect estimates that leverages high-dimensional regression adjustments. Our method can be used when the regression model is estimated using the lasso, the elastic net, subset selection, etc. Finally, we extend our analysis to allow for adaptive specification search via cross-validation and flexible nonparametric regression adjustments with machine-learning methods such as random forests or neural networks.",2016,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
MRI-based texture analysis of the primary tumor for pre-treatment prediction of bone metastases in prostate cancer.,"PURPOSE
To identify texture features of multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) for pre-treatment prediction of bone metastases (BM) in patients with prostate cancer (PCa).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
One-hundred and seventy-six patients with clinicopathologically confirmed PCa were enrolledï¼Œand the data was gathered from January 2008 to January 2018. A total of 976 texture features were extracted from T2-weighted (T2-w) and dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (DCE T1-w) MRI. Step regression, ridge regression and LASSO regression method model was applied to select features and develop the predicting model for BM. The performance of the radiomics features, PSA level and Gleason Score were explored with the respect to the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Multivariable logistic regression analysis starting with the following clinical risk factors (PSA level, Gleason Score and age) and imaging biomarkers were applied to develop diagnostic model for BM in PCa.


RESULTS
The texture features, which consisted of 15 selected features, were significantly associated with BM (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.01). The combined MRI features derived from T2-w and DCE T1-w showed better prognostic performance (AUCâ€¯=â€¯0.898) than features derived from single sequence (T2WI AUCâ€¯=â€¯0.875, DCE T1-w AUCâ€¯=â€¯0.870) and Gleason Score (AUCâ€¯=â€¯0.731) for pre-treatment prediction of BM in PCa. MRI -based imaging biomarker combined with clinical risk factors (free PSA, age and Gleason score) yielded the highest AUC(AUCâ€¯=â€¯0.916). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the imaging biomarker was an independent risk factor for the detection of bone metastases along with f-PSA level (free PSA) and Gleason score.


CONCLUSION
Multiparametric MRI-based texture feature was significant predictor for BM in PCa. Clinical risk factors combined with MRI-based texture feature could further improve the prediction performance, which provide an illustrative example of precision medicine and may affect treatment strategies.",2019,Magnetic resonance imaging
Explanation of somatic symptoms by mental health and personality traits: application of Bayesian regularized quantile regression in a large population study,"BackgroundSomatic syndrome is one of the remarkably prevalent issues in primary health care and subspecialty settings. We aimed to elucidate multidimensional associations between somatic symptoms with major mental problems and personality traits in the framework of the quantile regression model with a Bayesian approach.MethodsA total of 4763 employees at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services in Isfahan province, Iran, filled out four validated questionnaires including Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), NEO Questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and PHQ-15 for somatic symptom severity. In addition, Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGIDs) were determined using Rome IV criteria. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Bayesian regularized quantile regression with adaptive LASSO penalization were applied for reduced dimension of somatic symptoms and variable selection and parameter estimation, respectively.ResultsThe 25 major somatic symptoms were grouped into four factors including general, upper gastrointestinal, lower gastrointestinal and respiratory by EFA. Stress, depression, and anxiety had significant effects on all of the four extracted factors. The effect of anxiety in each four extracted factors was more than stress and depression. Neuroticism and agreeableness had significant effects on all of the four extracted factors, generally (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).ConclusionsGiven the high prevalence of somatic symptoms and psychosomatic complaints in correlation with the diverse range of mental co-morbidities, developing more detailed diagnostic tools and methods is crucial; nonetheless, it seems that providing better interdisciplinary approaches in general medical practice is groundwork.",2019,BMC Psychiatry
Bornes de risque amÃ©liorÃ©es pour le Lasso,"Although the Lasso has been extensively studied, the relationship between its prediction performance and the correlations of the covariates is not fully understood. In this document, we give new insights into this relationship in the context of multiple linear regression. We show, in particular, that the incorporation of a simple correlation measure into the tuning parameter leads to a nearly optimal prediction performance of the Lasso even for highly correlated covariates. However, we also reveal that for moderately correlated covariates, the prediction performance of the Lasso can be mediocre irrespective of the choice of the tuning parameter.",2014,
On LASSO for Predictive Regression,"A typical predictive regression employs a multitude of potential regressors with various degrees of persistence while their signal strength in explaining the dependent variable is often low. Variable selection in such context is of great importance. In this paper, we explore the pitfalls and possibilities of the LASSO methods in this predictive regression framework with mixed degrees of persistence. With the presence of stationary, unit root and cointegrated predictors, we show that the adaptive LASSO maintains the consistent variable selection and the oracle property due to its penalty scheme that accommodates the system of regressors. On the contrary, conventional LASSO does not have this desirable feature as the penalty is imposed according to the marginal behavior of each individual regressor. We demonstrate this theoretical property via extensive Monte Carlo simulations, and evaluate its empirical performance for short- and long-horizon stock return predictability.",2018,arXiv: Econometrics
Penalized solutions to functional regression problems,"Recent technological advances in continuous biological monitoring and personal exposure assessment have led to the collection of subject-specific functional data. A primary goal in such studies is to assess the relationship between the functional predictors and the functional responses. The historical functional linear model (HFLM) can be used to model such dependencies of the response on the history of the predictor values. An estimation procedure for the regression coefficients that uses a variety of regularization techniques is proposed. An approximation of the regression surface relating the predictor to the outcome by a finite-dimensional basis expansion is used, followed by penalization of the coefficients of the neighboring basis functions by restricting the size of the coefficient differences to be small. Penalties based on the absolute values of the basis function coefficient differences (corresponding to the LASSO) and the squares of these differences (corresponding to the penalized spline methodology) are studied. The fits are compared using an extension of the Akaike Information Criterion that combines the error variance estimate, degrees of freedom of the fit and the norm of the bases function coefficients. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated via simulations. The LASSO penalty applied to the linearly transformed coefficients yields sparser representations of the estimated regression surface, while the quadratic penalty provides solutions with the smallest L(2)-norm of the basis functions coefficients. Finally, the new estimation procedure is applied to the analysis of the effects of occupational particulate matter (PM) exposure on the heart rate variability (HRV) in a cohort of boilermaker workers. Results suggest that the strongest association between PM exposure and HRV in these workers occurs as a result of point exposures to the increased levels of particulate matter corresponding to smoking breaks.",2007,Computational statistics & data analysis
Efficiency of genomic prediction for boar taint reduction in Danish Landrace pigs,"Genetic selection against boar taint, which is caused by high skatole and androstenone concentrations in fat, is a more acceptable alternative than is the current practice of castration. Genomic predictors offer an opportunity to overcome the limitations of such selection caused by the phenotype being expressed only in males at slaughter, and this study evaluated different approaches to obtain such predictors. Samples from 1000 pigs were included in a design which was dominated by 421 sib pairs, each pair having one animal with high and one with low skatole concentration (â‰¥0.3Â Î¼g/g). All samples were measured for both skatole and androstenone and genotyped using the Illumina SNP60 porcine BeadChip for 62Â 153 single nucleotide polymorphisms. The accuracy of predicting phenotypes was assessed by cross-validation using six different genomic evaluation methods: genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and five Bayesian regression methods. In addition, this was compared to the accuracy of predictions using only QTL that showed genome-wide significance. The range of accuracies obtained by different prediction methods was narrow for androstenone, between 0.29 (Bayes Lasso) and 0.31 (Bayes B), and wider for skatole, between 0.21 (GBLUP) and 0.26 (Bayes SSVS). Relative accuracies, corrected for h(2) , were 0.54-0.56 and 0.75-0.94 for androstenone and skatole respectively. The whole-genome evaluation methods gave greater accuracy than using only the QTL detected in the data. The results demonstrate that GBLUP for androstenone is the simplest genomic technology to implement and was also close to the most accurate method. More specialised models may be preferable for skatole.",2015,Animal Genetics
Decoding force from deep brain electrodes in Parkinsonian patients,"Limitations of many Brain Machine Interface (BMI) systems using invasive electrodes include reliance on single neurons and decoding limited to kinematics only. This study investigates whether force-related information is present in the local field potential (LFP) recorded with deep brain electrodes using data from 14 patients with Parkinson's disease. A classifier based on logistic regression (LR) is developed to classify various force stages, using 10-fold cross validation. Least Absolute and Shrinkage Operator (Lasso) is then employed in order to identify the features with the most predictivity. The results show that force-related information is present in the LFP, and it is possible to distinguish between various force stages using certain frequency-domain (delta, beta, gamma) and time-domain (mobility) features in real-time.",2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, 2nd Edition","During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.

This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.

Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.",2009,
A prognostic model for predicting overall survival in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) men treated with second-line chemotherapy.,"5011 Background: Although several prognostic models for overall survival (OS) have been developed and validated in men with chemotherapy naive mCRPC, this work sought to develop and validate a prognostic model to predict OS in men who had progressed following first-line chemotherapy, and were receiving second line chemotherapy. Methods: Data from a phase III trial of cabazitaxel plus prednisone compared to mitoxantrone plus prednisone in mCRPC men who had developed progressive disease following first-line chemotherapy (TROPIC trial) were used. The TROPIC data was randomly split into training (n=507) and testing (n=248) sets. A separate data set consisting of 488 men previously treated with docetaxel who were randomly assigned to either satraplatin and prednisone or placebo and prednisone (SPARC trial), was used as a second testing set for external validation. Adaptive Lasso selected nine baseline prognostic factors of OS. A predictive score was computed from the estimated regression coefficients and used ...",2017,Journal of Clinical Oncology
Towards a blood-based diagnostic panel for bipolar disorder,"BACKGROUND
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a costly, devastating and life shortening mental disorder that is often misdiagnosed, especially on initial presentation. Misdiagnosis frequently results in ineffective treatment. We investigated the utility of a biomarker panel as a diagnostic test for BD.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
We performed a meta-analysis of eight case-control studies to define a diagnostic biomarker panel for BD. After validating the panel on established BD patients, we applied it to undiagnosed BD patients. We analysed 249 BD, 122 pre-diagnostic BD, 75 pre-diagnostic schizophrenia and 90 first onset major depression disorder (MDD) patients and 371 controls. The biomarker panel was identified using ten-fold cross-validation with lasso regression applied to the 87 analytes available across the meta-analysis studies. We identified 20 protein analytes with excellent predictive performance [area under the curve (AUC)â©¾0.90]. Importantly, the panel had a good predictive performance (AUC 0.84) to differentiate 12 misdiagnosed BD patients from 90 first onset MDD patients, and a fair to good predictive performance (AUC 0.79) to differentiate between 110 pre-diagnostic BD patients and 184 controls. We also demonstrated the disease specificity of the panel.


CONCLUSIONS
An early and accurate diagnosis has the potential to delay or even prevent the onset of BD. This study demonstrates the potential utility of a biomarker panel as a diagnostic test for BD.",2016,"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity"
PAC-Bayesian bounds for sparse regression estimation with exponential weights,"We consider the sparse regression model where the number of parametersp is larger than the sample size n. The difficulty when consideringhigh-dimensional problems is to propose estimators achieving a good compromisebetween statistical and computational performances. The BIC estimatorfor instance performs well from the statistical point of view [11] but can onlybe computed for values of p of at most a few tens. The Lasso estimator issolution of a convex minimization problem, hence computable for large valueof p. However stringent conditions on the design are required to establish fastrates of convergence for this estimator. Dalalyan and Tsybakov [19] proposea method achieving a good compromise between the statistical and computationalaspects of the problem. Their estimator can be computed for reasonablylarge p and satisfies nice statistical properties under weak assumptions on thedesign. However, [19] proposes sparsity oracle inequalities in expectation forthe empirical excess risk only. In this paper, we propose an aggregation proceduresimilar to that of [19] but with improved statistical performances. Ourmain theoretical result is a sparsity oracle inequality in probability for the trueexcess risk for a version of exponential weight estimator. We also propose aMCMC method to compute our estimator for reasonably large values of p.",2011,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Post-Lasso Inference for High-Dimensional Regression,"Among the most popular variable selection procedures in high-dimensional regression, Lasso provides a solution path to rank the variables and determines a cut-off position on the path to select variables and estimate coefficients. In this paper, we consider variable selection from a new perspective motivated by the frequently occurred phenomenon that relevant variables are not completely distinguishable from noise variables on the solution path. We propose to characterize the positions of the first noise variable and the last relevant variable on the path. We then develop a new variable selection procedure to control over-selection of the noise variables ranking after the last relevant variable, and, at the same time, retain a high proportion of relevant variables ranking before the first noise variable. Our procedure utilizes the recently developed covariance test statistic and Q statistic in post-selection inference. In numerical examples, our method compares favorably with other existing methods in selection accuracy and the ability to interpret its results.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
The de-biased group Lasso estimation for varying coefficient models,"There has been a lot of attention on the de-biased or de-sparsified Lasso since it was proposed in 2014. The Lasso is very useful in variable selection and obtaining initial estimators for other methods in high-dimensional settings. However, it is well-known that the Lasso produces biased estimators. Therefore several authors simultaneously proposed the de-biased Lasso to fix this drawback and carry out statistical inferences based on the de-biased Lasso estimators. The de-biased Lasso procedures need desirable estimators of high-dimensional precision matrices for bias correction. Thus the research is almost limited to linear regression models with some restrictive assumptions, generalized linear models with stringent assumptions and the like. To our knowledge, there are a few papers on linear regression models with group structure, but no result on structured nonparametric regression models such as varying coefficient models. In this paper, we apply the de-biased group Lasso to varying coefficient models and closely examine the theoretical properties and the effects of approximation errors involved in nonparametric regression. Some simulation results are also presented.",2019,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
Super Resolution of Image Using Sparse Representation of Image Patches with LASSO Approximation on CUDA Platform,"Image super resolution refers to increasing the physical dimensions of image to overcome resolution limitations originated from certain imaging sensors such as light sensitivity of sensor, environmental lightning conditions, physical size of sensor and also of each pixel w.r.t the sensor. With the help of sparse code and the dictionary it is possible to reconstruct good quality image with high resolution. Training images are used for obtaining the sample patches which are used for obtaining coefficients of the dictionary. Therefore the process of image super resolution is carried from sparse representation of low resolution image patch generating image of high resolution. Although method is effective, it is slow due to need of processing large number of image patches. Using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) approximation which is one of the regression analysis method where the approximation of solution is performed. The implementation is done on MATLAB (CPU) and NVidia CUDA platform. Here NVidia GPU which increases the speed of patch processing thereby overall improvement time consumed to run the algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated using performance parameters SSIM, Running Time, RMSE, PSNR and Entropy.",2018,2018 Second International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems (ICICCS)
Machine Learning in Spatial Study of Asthma Rate Distribution in Los Angeles County,"Public health studies have revealed numerous links between certain factors and asthma. Due to various causes of asthma attack and different reactions of people, it is necessary to construct a comprehensive model identifying key elements. Machine learning methods can be beneficial in dealing with multi data. We collected 35 variables reflecting environmental, social, medical and demographical status in Los Angeles County in 2013 based on the unit of census tract and built three linear regression models in explanation of asthma rate spatial disparity. Ordinary least square (OLS) method, principal component analysis (PCA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) are used in each model respectively. We prefer manually selected variables for explicit interpretation while LASSO behaves well in compressing a model. Furthermore, our results indicated that a neighborhood's socioeconomic composition (age, poverty of a neighborhood) has a substantial effect on asthma rate, but nonetheless, environmental risk and spatial accessibility factors also contribute to outcomes.",2018,2018 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)
Applications of machine learning to agricultural land values: prediction and causal inference,"This dissertation focuses on the prediction of agricultural land values and the effects of water rights on land values using machine learning algorithms and hedonic pricing methods. I predict agricultural land values with different machine learning algorithms, including ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, random forests, and extreme gradient boosting methods. To analyze the causal effects of water right seniority on agricultural land values, I use the double-selection LASSO technique. The second chapter presents the data used in the dissertation. A unique set of parcel sales from Property Valuation Division of Kansas constitute the backbone of the data used in the estimation. Along with parcel sales data, I collected detailed basis, water, tax, soil, weather, and urban influence data. This chapter provides detailed explanation of various data sources and variable construction processes. The third chapter presents different machine learning models for irrigated agricultural land price predictions in Kansas. Researchers, and policymakers use different models and data sets for price prediction. Recently developed machine learning methods have the power to improve the predictive ability of the models estimated. In this chapter I estimate several machine learning models for predicting the agricultural land values in Kansas. Results indicate that the predictive power of the machine learning methods are stronger compared to standard econometric methods. Median absolute error in extreme gradient boosting estimation is 0.1312 whereas it is 0.6528 in simple OLS model. The fourth chapter examines whether water right seniority is capitalized into irrigated agricultural land values in Kansas. Using a unique data set of irrigated agricultural land sales, I analyze the causal effect of water right seniority on agricultural land values. A possible concern during the estimation of hedonic models is the omitted variable bias so we use doubleselection LASSO regression and its variable selection properties to overcome the omitted variable bias. I also estimate generalized additive models to analyze the nonlinearities that may exist. Results show that water rights have a positive impact on irrigated land prices in Kansas. An additional year of water right seniority causes irrigated land value to increase nearly $17 per acre. Further analysis also suggest a nonlinear relationship between seniority and agricultural land prices.

Stock Market Forecasting Using LASSO Linear Regression Model,"Predicting stock exchange rates is receiving increasing attention and is a vital financial problem as it contributes to the development of effective strategies for stock exchange transactions. The forecasting of stock price movement in general is considered to be a thought-provoking and essential task for financial time seriesâ€™ exploration. In this paper, a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method based on a linear regression model is proposed as a novel method to predict financial market behavior. LASSO method is able to produce sparse solutions and performs very well when the numbers of features are less as compared to the number of observations. Experiments were performed with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. stock to determine the efficiency of the model. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the ridge linear regression model.",2014,
Use of SNP genotypes to identify carriers of harmful recessive mutations in cattle populations,"BackgroundSNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) genotype data are increasingly available in cattle populations and, among other things, can be used to predict carriers of specific mutations. It is therefore convenient to have a practical statistical method for the accurate classification of individuals into carriers and non-carriers. In this paper, we compared â€“ through cross-validationâ€“ five classification models (Lasso-penalized logistic regression â€“Lasso, Support Vector Machines with either linear or radial kernel â€“SVML and SVMR, k-nearest neighbors â€“KNN, and multi-allelic gene prediction â€“MAG), for the identification of carriers of the TUBD1 recessive mutation on BTA19 (Bos taurus autosome 19), known to be associated with high calf mortality. A population of 3116 Fleckvieh and 392 Brown Swiss animals genotyped with the 54K SNP-chip was available for the analysis.ResultsIn general, the use of SNP genotypes proved to be very effective for the identification of mutation carriers. The best predictive models were Lasso, SVML and MAG, with an average error rate, respectively, of 0.2 %, 0.4 % and 0.6 % in Fleckvieh, and 1.2 %, 0.9 % and 1.7 % in Brown Swiss. For the three models, the false positive rate was, respectively, 0.1 %, 0.1 % and 0.2 % in Fleckvieh, and 3.0 %, 2.4 % and 1.6 % in Brown Swiss; the false negative rate was 4.4 %, 7.6 %1.0 % in Fleckvieh, and 0.0 %, 0.1% and 0.8 % in Brown Swiss. MAG appeared to be more robust to sample size reduction: with 25 % of the data, the average error rate was 0.7 % and 2.2 % in Fleckvieh and Brown Swiss, compared to 2.1 % and 5.5 % with Lasso, and 2.6 % and 12.0 % with SVML.ConclusionsThe use of SNP genotypes is a very effective and efficient technique for the identification of mutation carriers in cattle populations. Very few misclassifications were observed, overall and both in the carriers and non-carriers classes. This indicates that this is a very reliable approach for potential applications in cattle breeding.",2016,BMC Genomics
NELasso: Group-Sparse Modeling for Characterizing Relations Among Named Entities in News Articles,"Named entities such as people, locations, and organizations play a vital role in characterizing online content. They often reflect information of interest and are frequently used in search queries. Although named entities can be detected reliably from textual content, extracting relations among them is more challenging, yet useful in various applications (e.g., news recommending systems). In this paper, we present a novel model and system for learning semantic relations among named entities from collections of news articles. We model each named entity occurrence with sparse structured logistic regression, and consider the words (predictors) to be grouped based on background semantics. This sparse group LASSO approach forces the weights of word groups that do not influence the prediction towards zero. The resulting sparse structure is utilized for defining the type and strength of relations. Our unsupervised system yields a named entitiesâ€™ network where each relation is typed, quantified, and characterized in context. These relations are the key to understanding news material over time and customizing newsfeeds for readers. Extensive evaluation of our system on articles from TIME magazine and BBC News shows that the learned relations correlate with static semantic relatedness measures like WLM, and capture the evolving relationships among named entities over time.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
