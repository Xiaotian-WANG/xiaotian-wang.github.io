Detection of Prostatic Inflammation From Peripheral Lymphocyte Count and Free/Total PSA Ratio in Men With LUTS/BPH,"Objective Identifying biomarkers of prostatic inflammation has been a question of great interest in the development of anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy for lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH). Systemic inflammation and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) have been linked with prostatic inflammation. This study set out to develop a diagnostic model for prostatic inflammation using clinical and laboratory parameters. Methods We included LUTS/BPH patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. The severity of prostatic inflammation was determined by pathological review. Clinical manifestations and preoperative laboratory test results were recorded. We used LASSO regression with 10-fold cross-validation to select variables with the most diagnostic value of prostatic inflammation. Furthermore, we used multivariable logistic regression analysis to develop the diagnostic model, presented in a nomogram. The discrimination, calibration of the post-LASSO diagnostic model, and the model supplemented with clinical parameters were assessed. Decision curve analysis was performed. Results A total of 164 patients were included. Of all patients, 97 (59.1%) had no or mild prostatic inflammation, and 67 (40.9%) had moderate to severe prostatic inflammation. A higher peripheral white blood cell count, higher peripheral lymphocyte count, lower free/total (f/t) PSA ratio, and acute urinary retention history were associated with a higher risk of moderate to severe prostatic inflammation. Peripheral lymphocyte count and f/t PSA ratio were selected by the LASSO method and entered into the nomogram. The post-LASSO diagnostic model had an AUC of 0.756 (95% CI: 0.684â€“0.829) and good calibration. The addition of clinical parameters failed to show incremental diagnostic value. The decision curve analysis demonstrated that the post-LASSO laboratory nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusion Our findings demonstrated that peripheral lymphocyte count and f/t PSA ratio appear to be reliable diagnostic markers, based on which we build a clinically useful nomogram for prostatic inflammation. This diagnostic model could facilitate the development of anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy for LUTS/BPH. Before this model is adopted in clinical practice, future validation is needed to determine its clinical utility.",2020,
Seven Foundations of Biological Monitoring and Assessment,"Pressure on nature from the impact of 6 billion humans is taking its toll. Living systems in water bodies illustrate this toll much as bloodcell counts and blood chemistry illustrate the health of a human body. For most of the twentieth century, society remained largely unaware of the collapse of aquatic ecosystems because we saw water narrowly, as a fluid to be consumed or used as a raw material in agriculture or industry. When attempted, monitoring focused on the presence of chemical contaminants rather than the character of the aquatic biota. Direct biological monitoring and assessment, an antidote to that lack of awareness, has gained substantial ground in the last decade because they provide a mechanism to directly assess the condition of water bodies, diagnose the causes of degradation, define actions to attain conservation and restoration goals, and evaluate the effectiveness of management decisions. Seven foundations of modern bioassessment programs are crucial to the development and use of a new generation of indicators to reverse the erosion of aquatic living systems. Sette principi fondamentali per il biomonitoraggio e la valutazione dellâ€™integrita ecologica La pressione di una popolazione di 6 miliardi di uomini esercita un forte impatto sulla natura. Le comunita degli organismi acquatici riflettono questo impatto come le analisi ematochimiche riflettono lo stato della salute umana. Per gran parte del XX secolo la consapevolezza del collasso degli ecosistemi acquatici e stata largamente carente, a causa delle nostre vedute ristrette che concepiscono lâ€™acqua come un fluido da consumare o da utilizzare come materia prima nellâ€™agricoltura e nellâ€™industria. Anche quando e stato attivato, il monitoraggio si e focalizzato sulla presenza di contaminanti chimici, anziche sulle comunita acquatiche. Nellâ€™ultimo decennio il monitoraggio e la valutazione biologica, un antidoto a tale mancanza di consapevolezza, hanno registrato sostanziali progressi poiche permettono di stimare direttamente lo stato dei corpi idrici, diagnosticare le cause del loro degrado, individuare le azioni necessarie per raggiungere gli obiettivi di conservazione e restauro ambientale e valutare lâ€™efficacia delle misure adottate. Vengono presentati sette principi fondamentali di moderni programmi di biomonitoraggio, di importanza cruciale per lâ€™individuazione e lâ€™utilizzo di una nuova generazione di indicatori, finalizzata ad invertire il progressivo degrado degli ecosistemi acquatici.

Major Paleozoic land plant evolutionary bio-events,"Abstract Adaptive radiations and extinctions affecting tracheophytes, the only group of land plants with a well-documented fossil record, occur during time intervals distinct from those affecting marine invertibrates. This distinctive pattern is recognizable at both Era and Period levels. Discordance between tracheophyte appearance, diversification and extinction and contemporary marine bio-events has been reflected in the recognition of â€˜planetaryâ€™ floras (Palaeophytic, Mesophytic, Cenophytic), the counterparts of marine invertibrate-based Eras of the Planerozoic (Paleozoic, Mesozoic, Cenozoic). Some have recognized significant levels of land-plant evolution, Epochs, within these planetary floras. With the discovery in the past 20 years of a major group of Middle Ordovician/Lower Silurian post-algal/pre-tracheophytic land plants, the concept of the Palaeophytic and its Epochs must be redefined. Here, the redefined Palaeophytic extends from the mid-Permian downward into the mid-Ordovician and three â€˜evolutionary land florasâ€™ are recognized: Eoembryophytic (mid-Ordovician to pre-latest Early Silurian); Eotracheophytic (latest Early Silurian through early Gedinnian); and Eutracheophytic (late Gedinnian to mid-Permian). The Silurian/Devonian boundary stressed in prevous Palaeophytic subdivisions is considered of limited importance as a major benchmark in land plant evolution. A newly defined Era, the Epeirophytic, a continental counterpart of Kryshtofovich's marine Thalassophytic, is recognized with an upper boundary at the mid-Ordovician and extending down indefinitely into the Precambrian. One major evolutionary flora, the Phycomycophytic, first recognized by Kryshtofovich for the Thalassophytic, is recognized for the continental habitat as well.",1993,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"
Simultaneous estimation and factor selection in quantile regression via adaptive sup-norm regularization,"Some regularization methods, including the group lasso and the adaptive group lasso, have been developed for the automatic selection of grouped variables (factors) in conditional mean regression. In many practical situations, such a problem arises naturally when a set of dummy variables is used to represent a categorical factor and/or when a set of basis functions of a continuous variable is included in the predictor set. Complementary to these earlier works, the simultaneous and automatic factor selection is examined in quantile regression. To incorporate the factor information into regularized model fitting, the adaptive sup-norm regularized quantile regression is proposed, which penalizes the empirical check loss function by the sum of factor-wise adaptive sup-norm penalties. It is shown that the proposed method possesses the oracle property. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed method is a more appropriate tool for factor selection than the adaptive lasso regularized quantile regression.",2012,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Additive Models for Quantile Regression: Some New Methods for R,"This brief report describes some recent developments of the R quantreg package to incorporate methods for additive models. The methods are illustrated with an application to modeling childhood malnutrition in India. Models with additive nonparametric effects offer a valuable dimension reduction device throughout applied statistics. In this paper we describe some recent developments of additive models for quantile regression. These methods employ the total variation smoothing penalties introduced in Koenker, Ng, and Portnoy (1994) for univariate components and Koenker and Mizera (2004) for bivariate components. We focus on selection of smoothing parameters including lasso-type selection of parametric components, and on post selection inference methods. Additive models have received considerable attention since their introduction by Hastie and Tibshirani (1986, 1990). They provide a pragmatic approach to nonparametric regression modeling; by restricting nonparametric components to be composed of low-dimensional additive pieces we can circumvent some of the worst aspects of the notorious curse of dimensionality. It should be emphasized that we use the word â€œcircumventâ€™ advisedly, in full recognition that we have only swept difficulties under the rug by the assumption of additivity. When conditions for additivity are violated there will obviously be a price to pay. 1. Additive Models for Quantile Regression Our approach to additive models for quantile regression and especially our implementation of methods in R is heavily influenced by Wood (2006, 2009) . In some fundamental respects the approaches are quite distinct: Gaussian likelihood is replaced by (Laplacean) quantile fidelity, squared L2 norms as measures of the roughness of fitted functions are replaced by corresponding L1 norms measuring total variation, and truncated basis expansions are supplanted by sparse algebra as a computational expedient. But in other respects the structure of the models is quite similar. We will consider models for conditional quantiles of the general form: Version: September 5, 2009. This research was partially supported by NSF grant SES-08-50060. I would like to express my appreciation to Ying Li for excellent research assistance. All of the methods described below have been implemented in version 4.42 of the quantreg package for R, Koenker (2009).",2010,

"Development of a spatial sampling protocol using GIS to measure health disparities in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, a medium-sized African city","BackgroundMany cities in developing countries experience an unplanned and rapid growth. Several studies have shown that the irregular urbanization and equipment of cities produce different health risks and uneven exposure to specific diseases. Consequently, health surveys within cities should be carried out at the micro-local scale and sampling methods should try to capture this urban diversity.MethodsThis article describes the methodology used to develop a multi-stage sampling protocol to select a population for a demographic survey that investigates health disparities in the medium-sized city of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. It is based on the characterization of Bobo-Dioulasso city typology by taking into account the city heterogeneity, as determined by analysis of the built environment and of the distribution of urban infrastructures, such as healthcare structures or even water fountains, by photo-interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images. Principal component analysis and hierarchical ascendant classification were then used to generate the city typology.ResultsFive groups of spaces with specific profiles were identified according to a set of variables which could be considered as proxy indicators of health status. Within these five groups, four sub-spaces were randomly selected for the study. We were then able to survey 1045 households in all the selected sub-spaces. The pertinence of this approach is discussed regarding to classical sampling as random walk method for example.ConclusionThis urban space typology allowed to select a population living in areas representative of the uneven urbanization process, and to characterize its health status in regards to several indicators (nutritional status, communicable and non-communicable diseases, and anaemia). Although this method should be validated and compared with more established methods, it appears as an alternative in developing countries where geographic and population data are scarce.",2017,International Journal of Health Geographics
Adaptive rotor blade concepts: direct twist and camber variation,"Applying adaptronics to helicopters has a high potential to significantly suppress noise, reduce vibration and increase the overall aerodynamic efficiency. Since the interaction of non-stationary helicopter aerodynamics and elastomechanical structural characteristics of the helicopter blades causes flight envelope limitations, vibration and noise, a good comprehension of the aerodynamics is essential for the development of structural solutions to effectively influence the local airflow conditions and finally develop a structural concept. With respect to these considerations, this paper presents recent investigations on two different structural concepts: the direct twist and the camber variation concept. The direct twist concept allows to directly control the twist of the helicopter blades by smart adaptive elements and through this to positively influence the main rotor area which is the primary source for helicopter noise and vibration. The concept is based upon the actively controlled tension-torsion-coupling of the structure. For this, an actuator is integrated within a helicopter blade that is made of anisotropic fibre composite material. Driving the actuator results in a local twist of the blade tip, in such a way that the blade can be considered as a torsional actuator. Influencing the blade twist distribution finally results in a higher aerodynamic efficiency. The direct twist concept was analytically modelled using an expanded Vlassov Theory before a proof-of-principle demonstration structure was manufactured. Subsequently, a Mach-scaled Bo105 model rotor blade with an integrated piezoelectric actuator was designed and successfully tested. Next, small scale rotor tests and investigation of thermal loads are planned. The camber variation concept uses the experiences gained in the design of the direct twist concept to create a rotor blade, that will be able to change the shape of its cross-section in operation. This shape control approach uses material anisotropy (e.g. tension-torsion-coupling) to create a smooth aerodynamic surface and to avoid the airflow disturbances created by the leading or trailing edge flaps, that have already been investigated. First, a structural model was numerically investigated to identify the most influential parameters of this concept. From this model, the two-dimensional surface quality of the deformed rotor blade was extracted as a basis for aerodynamic calculations that are necessary to derive the quantity of deformation needed to successfully delay aerodynamic stall onset. As a next step, a proof-of-principle structural demonstrator is presently being designed. Both concepts were designed to be activated using a piezoelectric stack-actuator integrated at the blade tip. Since continiuously integrated piezo sheets promise a potential to increase the conceptsÂ’ performance, thin actuator modules are currently under investigation.",2000,
The implications of divergence in spatial nesting patterns in the geminate Caribbean and Pacific sergeant major damselfishes,"Abstract Male Caribbean Abudefduf saxatilis , and Pacific, A. troschelii , sergeant majors nest in colonies, but nest densities in the Pacific are much greater than in the Caribbean. The relatively dense within-colony aggregations in the Pacific have apparently been favoured by the screening effects of defence by peripheral males against foraging groups of the wrasse, Thalassoma lucasanum , resulting in lower rates of predation on embryos guarded by males with centrally placed nests. Males with centrally placed nests were also more likely to spawn successfully than were those with peripheral nests, suggesting that aggregated nesting has been further reinforced by female preferences for males with nests in which risk of predation on embryos is lowest. In the Caribbean, where similar predation on embryos was absent, relatively slight within-colony spatial aggregation of nesting was observed. This tendency might be maintained by female preferences for males with close nearest-neighbour distances because males that failed to spawn had longer nearest-neighbour distances than those that did spawn, but the difference was only marginally significant. Alternatively, because the Caribbean and Pacific species are thought to have been derived from a single population following the uplift of the isthmus of Panama, it is possible that spatial aggregation represents a residual tendency, originally favoured by selection under ancestral conditions.",1989,Animal Behaviour
Toward Probabilistic Diagnosis and Understanding of Depression Based on Functional MRI Data Analysis with Logistic Group LASSO,"Diagnosis of psychiatric disorders based on brain imaging data is highly desirable in clinical applications. However, a common problem in applying machine learning algorithms is that the number of imaging data dimensions often greatly exceeds the number of available training samples. Furthermore, interpretability of the learned classifier with respect to brain function and anatomy is an important, but non-trivial issue. We propose the use of logistic regression with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to capture the most critical input features. In particular, we consider application of group LASSO to select brain areas relevant to diagnosis. An additional advantage of LASSO is its probabilistic output, which allows evaluation of diagnosis certainty. To verify our approach, we obtained semantic and phonological verbal fluency fMRI data from 31 depression patients and 31 control subjects, and compared the performances of group LASSO (gLASSO), and sparse group LASSO (sgLASSO) to those of standard LASSO (sLASSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. Over 90% classification accuracy was achieved with gLASSO, sgLASSO, as well as SVM; however, in contrast to SVM, LASSO approaches allow for identification of the most discriminative weights and estimation of prediction reliability. Semantic task data revealed contributions to the classification from left precuneus, left precentral gyrus, left inferior frontal cortex (pars triangularis), and left cerebellum (c rus1). Weights for the phonological task indicated contributions from left inferior frontal operculum, left post central gyrus, left insula, left middle frontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal cortices, bilateral precuneus, left inferior frontal cortex (pars triangularis), and left precentral gyrus. The distribution of normalized odds ratios further showed, that predictions with absolute odds ratios higher than 0.2 could be regarded as certain.",2015,PLoS ONE

An Ordered Search for Subset Selection in Support Vector Orthogonal Regression,"Subset selection is an important task in many problems, especially when dealing with high dimensional problems, such as classification, regression, and others. In this sense, this work proposes an ordered search to select variables in orthogonal regression problems based on support vectors. The admissible search is based on a monotone property of the radius parameter. Thus, we use the radius of the SV-regression as an evaluation measure for the search, making it able to find the subsets with the smallest radius in each dimension of the problem without exhaustively exploring all possibilities. The main reason for choosing the orthogonal regression is due to the fact that this model also considers the existence of error in dependent variables. The obtained results, represented by the test error, when compared to the LASSO and a recursive feature elimination technique, demonstrate the efficiency of the method.",2019,
On the grouped selection and model complexity of the adaptive elastic net,"Lasso proved to be an extremely successful technique for simultaneous estimation and variable selection. However lasso has two major drawbacks. First, it does not enforce any grouping effect and secondly in some situation lasso solutions are inconsistent for variable selection. To overcome this inconsistency adaptive lasso is proposed where adaptive weights are used for penalizing different coefficients. Recently a doubly regularized technique namely elastic net is proposed which encourages grouping effect i.e. either selection or omission of the correlated variables together. However elastic net is also inconsistent. In this paper we study adaptive elastic net which does not have this drawback. In this article we specially focus on the grouped selection property of adaptive elastic net along with its model selection complexity. We also shed some light on the bias-variance tradeoff of different regularization methods including adaptive elastic net. An efficient algorithm was proposed in the line of LARS-EN, which is then illustrated with simulated as well as real life data examples.",2011,Statistics and Computing
Plenary: The Optimistic Bayesian: Replica Method Analysis of Compressed Sensing,"The conventional emphases in data acquisition are the density and accuracy of measurements. Compressed sensing has reminded us of the importance of modeling and has brought sparsityand compressibility-based models to the fore. Furthermore, the variety of computations that can be performed with the same data can give a broad trade-off between computational cost and performance. This talk will review results on sparse signal support recovery and sparse signal estimation in a non-Bayesian setting. Full support recovery in the presence of noise is difficult, and the results for estimation are quantitatively pessimistic. The replica method, a non-rigorous but successful technique from statistical physics, is used for asymptotic analysis in a Bayesian setting. This can be applied to many estimators used in compressed sensing, including basis pursuit, lasso, linear estimation with thresholding, and zero norm-regularized estimation. It reduces the analysis of compressed sensing to the study of scalar estimation problems and gives results that are more encouraging for compressed sensing. The talk is based on joint work with Alyson Fletcher and Sundeep Rangan.",2010,
Tradizioni scrittorie venezianeggianti a Ragusa nel XIV secolo: edizione e commento di testi volgari dell'Archivio di Stato di Dubrovnik,"In the Middle Ages Ragusa/Dubrovnik was a maritime centre of prime importance: it was the first harbour for ship entering the Adriatic and at the same time the last base before handling the sailing in the Mediterranean, mostly eastward. In addition the strong economic contacts with the hinterland guaranteed to the city an unchallenged supremacy in the import-export management between the Balkan Peninsula and the West. Forced to the subjection to Venice in 1205, following the Fourth Crusade, it accepted its rule until the 1358, achieving with the Zaran peace a substantial independence limited only by the formal recognition of the sovereignty of the King of Hungary and Croatia. 
The Venetian period was short but also full of consequences from a linguistic point of view with the transplant of Venetian linguistic models in spoken and written language. The spread of a Venetian style vehicular language was inserted into a quite differentiated linguistic scene, which reflected the complex pluriethnic composition of the city and its multi-facets, with direct relationship with the Latin West as well as the Slavic East. Actually, besides the Venetian language, the repertoire of the Ragusan linguistic community was made up of at least the Croatian - the majority language - the Ragusan - namely the autochthonous Romance survived until the end of the 15th century among the families of more ancient tradition - and the other vernacular Italo-Romances widespread because of social and economic relations mainly concerning Tuscany and the maritime centres on the west bank of the Adriatic. 
The relevance of the medieval vernacular linguistic heritage held in the DrÅ¾avni arhiv u Dubrovniku had already been disclosed by Gianfranco Folena in the famous contribution entitled Introduzione al veneziano Â«de la da marÂ», a fascinating recognition of the multiple linguistic contacts of the lagoonal variety in the various environments reached by the commercial and economic expansion of the Venetian thalassocracy. Partially granting the stimulations from that wise person, the search work meant to give a brief picture of the Venetian writing traditions widespread in Ragusa in the 14th century through the edition and comment of documentary texts. The bibliographic research on the printing editions and especially the direct research on record have distinguished three typologies of vernacular use, according to the basis of the production area and writer's identities: an autochthonous tradition attributable to Ragusan writers, especially constituted by the letters that the merchants wrote to the panels of judges of the city, regarding summons for legal disputes of different sorts; a tradition inside the chancellery, which was made of people from the Italian Peninsula, whose tasks were the writing and recording of letters and commissions addressed to private citizens or city hall officers, such as ambassadors, mayors, counts, captains, etc.; finally an intermediate tradition constituted by the texts produced outside the chancellery but copied by the chancellors for probative purposes in the chancellery record offices. The research has only been focused on the first two traditions because more reliable from a linguistic point of view. 
It has been organized a corpus of 53 first-hand texts datable between the end of the 13th century and the third decade of the 14th century (39 unpublished and 14 published) for the vernacular scripta of the Ragusan writers. The linguistic comment illustrates their main components, giving particular attention to the spelling, phonetics and morphology: the Venetian base formed by the common traits to the lagoonal coeval scripta, the removal of characteristic or specific elements of the Venetian language, eventually the differential traits testifying an autonomous revision of the model. The analysis shows how the variation spreads out on a heterogeneous and differentiated material, probably because of as much differentiated levels of acquisition of the Venetian model. However, if the analysis gets out from the individual dimension of the single textual units, then you will catch an ordered linguistic reality, able to be ordered according to the dialectics between the previously illustrated components. 
Two corpora have been organized for the vernacular scripta of the chancellery: a first exhaustive corpus for the texts dating back to the Venetian domination, therefore datable ante 1358 (14 texts), and a second corpus based on a selection on subsequent texts, datable between the 1358 and the 1380, kept in the DAD registry, s. XXVII.1 Litterae et commissiones, vol. 2 (57 texts). In this case the analysis has been carried out on the individual profile of the single chancellors because they came from different areas of the Italian peninsula: the north-east area (Cividale and Rivignano), the Po area (Arco, Piacenza), Tuscany (Pistoia), Southern Italy (Brindisi). In spite of such varied origins, the vernacular texts written by the Ragusan chancellery show a quite close linguistic physiognomy, due to the influence of two common models: Latin, mainly exerting its pressure from a spelling point of view and obviously the Venetian. 
The penetration of scriptae in the Venetian style outside and inside the chancellery must not be interpreted as a transplant taking place from above, following a definite and conscious linguistic politics. The assimilation was achieved from the bottom as a result of the political, economical, social and personal contacts running along the direction linking the two cities. Under this profile we must consider the absence of a significant linguistic change straddling the 1358, because on the contrary the writings would maintain or consolidate the Venetian base during the second half of the 14th century. In favour of the freedom of writing, the value that the Medieval culture imputed to the linguistic identity had an influence, which was less tying with regard to other identities such as the religious or legal one, and therefore more receptive and willing to adopt a polychromatic physiognomy according to the different usage contexts.",2008,

"The apertospathulidae, a new family of haptorid ciliates (protozoa, ciliophora).","We studied the morphology of three rare haptorid ciliates, using live observation and silver impregnation: Apertospathula verruculifera n. sp., Longispatha elegans n. gen., n. sp., and Rhinothrix porculus (Penard, 1922) n. gen., n. comb. Simple ethanol fixation (50-70%, v/v) is recommended to reveal the ciliary pattern of ""difficult"" ciliates, such as R. porculus, by protargol impregnation. The three genera investigated have a distinct feature in common, viz., a lasso-shaped oral bulge and circumoral kinety, where the right half is slightly to distinctly longer than the left and the circumoral kinety is open ventrally. Thus, they are united in a new spathidiid family, the Apertospathulidae n. fam., which probably evolved from a Bryophyllum-like ancestor by partial reduction of the oral bulge and circumoral kinety. Apertospathula verruculifera has a wart-like process, the palpus dorsalis, at the anterior end of the dorsal brush. The right branch of the circumoral kinety is only slightly longer than the left one. Longispatha elegans has a straight oral bulge and circumoral kinety, the right branch of which extends to the posterior end of the body while the left branch ends in the anterior third of the body. Rhinothrix porculus, a curious ciliate with a snout-like dorsal elongation of the oral bulge, the palpus oralis, has a highly characteristic ciliary pattern: the oral pattern is as in Longispatha, but the bulge and circumoral kinety extend spirally to the posterior end of the body while the somatic kineties course meridionally. This is achieved by inserting some shortened kineties in the curves of the oral bulge.",2005,The Journal of eukaryotic microbiology

Introduction Patients with previous ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) may experience the recurrence of peri-mitral flutter (PMFL). These arrhythmias are usually triggered from sources that may also induce atrial fibrillation. We sought to determine whether ablation of triggers or completing mitral valve isthmus (MVI) block prevents more arrhythmia recurrences.

Methods A total of 65 patients with recurrent PMFL after initial ablation of long-standing persistent AF were included in the study. Thirty-two were randomized to MVI ablation only (Group 1) and 33 were randomized to cardioversion and repeat pulmonary vein (PV) isolation plus ablation of others non-PV triggers (Group 2).

Results MVI bidirectional block was achieved in all but one patient from Group 1. In Group 2, reconnection of 17 PVs was detected in 14 patients (42%, 1.21 veins per patient). With isoproterenol challenge, 44 non-PV trigger sites were identified in 28 patients (85%, 1.57 sites per patient). With a follow-up of 18 months, 27 patients (84%) from Group 1 had recurrent atrial arrhythmias and 15 remained on AAD, while 28 patients from Group 2 (85%, P < 0.0001 vs. Group 1) were free of arrhythmia off AAD. Cox regression model revealed that the ablation strategy used in Group 2 was associated with a significant lower risk of recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia (hazard ratio = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.04â€“0.28, P < 0.001). The Kaplanâ€“Meier curves demonstrated significant better arrhythmia-free survival in Group 2 compared with Group 1 (log rank P < 0.0001).

Conclusions In patients presenting with PMFL after ablation for long-standing persistent AF, MVI block had limited impact on arrhythmia recurrence. On the other hand, elimination of all PV and non-PV triggers achieved higher freedom from atrial arrhythmias at follow-up.

# Comparison of sensitivity of transthoracic, transoesophageal, and intracardiac echocardiography for guiding transeptal puncture {#article-title-3}

Objective Compare the sensitivity of transthoracic (TTE), transoesophageal (TEE), and intracardiac (ICE) echocardiography for guiding interatrial septum (IAS) puncture.

Methods The study consisted of 208 patients (48 females, mean age 56.4 Â± 11.3 years) who underwent RFA of LA because of atrial fibrillation. Transeptal puncture was performed after IAS visualization using TTE in 32 (15.4%), TEE in 26 (12.5%), ICE in 150 (72.1%) patients. Adequate contact of transeptal needle with IAS was defined as a tension of septum using echocardiographic techniques. Verification of tenting and following transeptal puncture with LA catheterization was defined as a true positive result. Lack of visualization of tenting with successful transeptal puncture under fluoroscopy was defined as a false-negative result.

Results Clear visualization of the IAS using TTE technique was demonstrated in 2 (6%) cases, and the sensitivity amounted for 6.7%. Obvious verification of IAS by TEE was revealed in 20 (77%) patients, and sensitivity of this technique was 86.9%. ICE control of septum puncture was performed in 127 patients. ICE allowed visualizing septum and tenting in 125 patients and the tension of septum was unable to be determined in two cases despite of the efforts of specialists. ICE sensitivity for IAS verification was 98.4%.

Conclusion ICE is the most sensitive ultrasound technique for verification of optimal location of the transeptal needle in the region of IAS comparing with TTE and TEE.

# Pulmonary antrum radial-linear ablation: a new therapy for atrial fibrillation {#article-title-4}

The abnormality of substrates in pulmonary vein antrum (PVA) plays a critical role in maintaining atrial fibrillation (AF). PVA radial-linear ablation (PVARA) was performed for an organized modification of substrates in paroxysmal AF. This study consisted of two phases: preclinical phase using 22 canine models with acutely induced AF, and clinical phase in patients with paroxysmal AF ( n = 15) in paired control with PV isolation. Radial-linear lesions were created from PV orifice to left atrium-PV junction in both dogs and patients. Successful creation of chronic radial-linear lesions was confirmed pathologically in dogs. The AF inducibility and duration decreased by 89 and 90%, respectively, after ablation in dogs. All the patients showed inducible AF prior to the procedure. No AF was inducible immediately after PVARA in 14 patients. The procedural time was significantly shorter in patients with PVARA than PV isolation. Within 1 week after ablation, there were six patients with early recurrent AF and seven with atrial tachycardia (AT) in PVARA group, and three patients with AF and six with AT in control. During follow-up of 6â€“12 months, 11 patients were free of AF and AT with four patients taking propafenone or amiodarone in the PVARA group, and nine patients free of AF and AT with seven patients taking propafenone or amiodarone in control. No complication related to the ablation developed in the two groups. This pilot study demonstrated that PVARA was a simple and safe strategy for paroxysmal AF ablation, and might provide a better long-term outcome than PV isolation.

# Pulmonary vein isolation with a multi-electrode ablation catheter using duly-cycled bipolar and unipolar radiofrequency energy {#article-title-5}

Background Traditional catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) requires long procedure times and high level of operator skill. A multielectrode catheter (PVAC, ablation frontier) combining circular mapping and duly-cycled bipolar and unipolar radiofrequency energy delivery has been developed to map and isolate the pulmonary veins.

Aim The aim of this study to evaluate the efficacy of PVAC for pulmonary vein isolation in paroxysmal AF ablation.

Methods Fifty consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF who had failed at least one anti-arrhythmic drug and eligible for catheter ablation were included in the study. All four pulmonary veins were isolated and confirmed the absence of pulmonary vein potentials with PVAC. At six months, 48 h Holter monitoring was performed to determine freedom of AF.

Results All patients had structurally normal hearts with a mean duration of AF of 4.28 + 4.39 years. The mean procedure time was 109.74 + 28.35Â min. Mean fluoroscopy time was 36.52 + 12.29Â min. Mean number of RF applications were 27.79 + 13.80 min. The mean follow-up duration was 9.39 + 4.90 months. After AF ablation with PVAC, 36 patients completed 6-month follow-up and 25 patients (69.4%) were in sinus rhythm without drugs. No procedure-related complication was observed.

Conclusions Pulmonary vein isolation using the PVAC has a success rate of âˆ¼70% with the first ablation.

# Autonomic mechanism for complex fractionated atrial electrograms: evidence by pathology {#article-title-6}

Background The mechanism(s) underlying complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) has not been well elucidated. The present study addressed to observe the histological characteristics at the area with CFAEs in canine atria to investigate the mechanism of CFAEs.

Methods Ten adult mongrel dogs were involved in the present study. AF was induced through rapid atrial pacing with vagosympathetic nerve stimulation. CFAEs was recorded by Lasso catheter. Irrigated ablation was performed at sites with CFAEs. After finishing procedures above, all dogs were sacrificed and the whole hearts were taken out and fixed in 4Â¢Hformalin for more than 48 hours for histological examination. The specimens were divided into CFAEs group and non-CFAEs group. Serial sections were taken and stained with hematoxylin and eosin(HE) and general neural marker protein gene product 9.50(PGP9.50), respectively. Compare the characteristics of myocardial and autonomic nerve distribution between the CFAEs and non-CFAEs groups.

Results Sections stained by HE: The myocardium in non-CFAEs group was well-arranged, usually in parallel with little interstitial and epicardial adipose tissue. However, the myocardium in CFAEs group distributed in disorganization with more interstitial tissue and epicardial adipose tissue. Nerve fibers and ganglionated plexi (autonomic nerves) in CFAEs group were more abundant than non-CFAEs group (7Â±5.4 vs. 1.9Â±2.7; P<0.001). Autonomic nerves were abundant in epicardium.

Conclusion Disorganized myocardial distribution and abundant autonomic nerves may account for CFAEs formation, which may play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of AF.",2011,Europace
A New Approach towards Minimizing the Risk of Misdosing Warfarin Initiation Doses,"It is a challenge to be able to prescribe the optimal initial dose of warfarin. There have been many studies focused on an efficient strategy to determine the optimal initial dose. Numerous clinical, genetic, and environmental factors affect the warfarin dose response. In practice, it is common that the initial warfarin dose is substantially different from the stable maintenance dose, which may increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis prior to achieving the stable maintenance dose. In order to minimize the risk of misdosing, despite popular warfarin dose prediction models in the literature which create dose predictions solely based on patients' attributes, we have taken physicians' opinions towards the initial dose into consideration. The initial doses selected by clinicians, along with other standard clinical factors, are used to determine an estimate of the difference between the initial dose and estimated maintenance dose using shrinkage methods. The selected shrinkage method was LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator). The estimated maintenance dose was more accurate than the original initial dose, the dose predicted by a linear model without involving the clinicians initial dose, and the values predicted by the most commonly used model in the literature, the Gage clinical model.",2018,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine
Use of a novel evolutionary algorithm for genomic selection,"Background: In the context of genomic selection in animal breeding, an 
important objective is to look for explicative markers for a phenotype under 
study. The challenge of this study was to propose a model, based on a small 
number of markers, to predict a quantitative trait. To deal with a high number of 
markers, we propose using combinatorial optimization to perform variable 
selection, associated with a multiple regression model in a first approach and a 
mixed model in a second, to predict the phenotype. 
Results:The efficiency of our two approaches, the first assuming that animals are 
independent and the second integrating familial relationships, was evaluated on 
real datasets. This reveals the importance of taking familial relationships into 
account as the performances of the second approach were better. For example, 
on PIC data the correlation is around 0.15 higher using our approach taking 
familial relationships into account than with the Lasso bounded to 96 selected 
markers. We also studied the importance of familial relationships on phenotypes 
with different heritabilities. Finally, we compared our approaches with classic 
approaches and obtained comparable results, sometimes better. 
Conclusion: This study shows the relevance of combining combinatorial 
optimization with a regression model to propose a predictive model based on a 
reasonable number of markers. Although this implies more parameters to be 
estimated and, therefore, takes longer to execute, it seems interesting to use a 
mixed model in order to take familial relationships between animals into account.",2015,
Task-Dependent Visual-Codebook Compression,"A visual codebook serves as a fundamental component in many state-of-the-art computer vision systems. Most existing codebooks are built based on quantizing local feature descriptors extracted from training images. Subsequently, each image is represented as a high-dimensional bag-of-words histogram. Such highly redundant image description lacks efficiency in both storage and retrieval, in which only a few bins are nonzero and distributed sparsely. Furthermore, most existing codebooks are built based solely on the visual statistics of local descriptors, without considering the supervise labels coming from the subsequent recognition or classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a task-dependent codebook compression framework to handle the above two problems. First, we propose to learn a compression function to map an originally high-dimensional codebook into a compact codebook while maintaining its visual discriminability. This is achieved by a codeword sparse coding scheme with Lasso regression, which minimizes the descriptor distortions of training images after codebook compression. Second, we propose to adapt our codebook compression to the subsequent recognition or classification tasks. This is achieved by introducing a label constraint kernel (LCK) into our compression loss function. In particular, our LCK can model heterogeneous kinds of supervision, i.e., (partial) category labels, correlative semantic annotations, and image query logs. We validated our codebook compression in three computer vision tasks: 1) object recognition in PASCAL Visual Object Class 07; 2) near-duplicate image retrieval in UKBench; and 3) web image search in a collection of 0.5 million Flickr photographs. Our compressed codebook has shown superior performances over several state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised codebooks.",2012,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing
Breaking the Nonsmooth Barrier: A Scalable Parallel Method for Composite Optimization,"Due to their simplicity and excellent performance, parallel asynchronous variants of stochastic gradient descent have become popular methods to solve a wide range of large-scale optimization problems on multi-core architectures. Yet, despite their practical success, support for nonsmooth objectives is still lacking, making them unsuitable for many problems of interest in machine learning, such as the Lasso, group Lasso or empirical risk minimization with convex constraints. 
In this work, we propose and analyze ProxASAGA, a fully asynchronous sparse method inspired by SAGA, a variance reduced incremental gradient algorithm. The proposed method is easy to implement and significantly outperforms the state of the art on several nonsmooth, large-scale problems. We prove that our method achieves a theoretical linear speedup with respect to the sequential version under assumptions on the sparsity of gradients and block-separability of the proximal term. Empirical benchmarks on a multi-core architecture illustrate practical speedups of up to 12x on a 20-core machine.",2017,
Whole genome analysis identifies the association of TP53 genomic deletions with lower survival in Stage III colorectal cancer,"DNA copy number aberrations (CNA) are frequently observed in colorectal cancers (CRC). There is an urgent need for CNA-based biomarkers in clinics,. n For Stage III CRC, if combined with imaging or pathologic evidence, these markers promise more precise care. We conducted this Stage III specific biomarker discovery with a cohort of 134 CRCs, and with a newly developed high-efficiency CNA profiling protocol. Specifically, we developed the profiling protocol for tumor-normal matched tissue samples based on low-coverage clinical whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We demonstrated the protocolâ€™s accuracy and robustness by a systematic benchmark with microarray, high-coverage whole-exome and -genome approaches, where the low-coverage WGS-derived CNA segments were highly accordant (PCC >0.95) with those derived from microarray, and they were substantially less variable if compared to exome-derived segments. A lasso-based model and multivariate cox regression analysis identified a chromosome 17p loss, containing the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, that was significantly associated with reduced survival (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0139, HRâ€‰=â€‰1.688, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰[1.112â€“2.562]), which was validated by an independent cohort of 187 Stage III CRCs. In summary, this low-coverage WGS protocol has high sensitivity, high resolution and low cost and the identified 17p-loss is an effective poor prognosis marker for Stage III patients.",2020,Scientific Reports
$\ell_P$ Norm Independently Interpretable Regularization Based Sparse Coding for Highly Correlated Data,"Sparse coding, which aims at finding appropriate sparse representations of data with an overcomplete dictionary set, is a well-established signal processing methodology and has good efficiency in various areas. The varying sparse constraint can influence the performances of sparse coding algorithms greatly. However, commonly used sparse regularization may not be robust in high-coherence condition. In this paper, inspired from independently interpretable lasso (IILasso), which considers the coherence of sensing matrix columns in constraint to implement the strategy of selecting uncorrelated variables, we propose a new regularization by introducing <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _{p}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> norm <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$(0 < p < 1)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> into the regularization part of IILasso. The new regularization can efficiently enhance the performances in obtaining sparse and accurate coefficient. To solve the optimization problem with the new regularization, we propose to use the coordinate descent algorithm with weighted <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> norm, named independently interpretable weighted lasso (IIWLasso), and the proximal operator, named independently interpretable iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (II-ISTA) and independently interpretable proximal operator for <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _{\frac {2}{3}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> norm regularization (II2/3PO). We present synthetic data experiments and gene expression data experiments to validate the performance of our proposed algorithms. The experiment results show that all independently interpretable algorithms can perform better than their original ones in different coherence conditions. Among them, IIWLasso can obtain relatively best performance both in relative norm error and support error of synthetic data and misclassification error of tenfold cross-validating gene expression data.",2019,IEEE Access
Using LASSO Regression to Predict Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment Efficacy,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) accounts for one-fifth of the deaths due to arthritis, the leading cause of disability in the United States. Finding effective treatments for managing arthritis symptoms are a major challenge, since the mechanisms of autoimmune disorders are not fully understood and disease presentation differs for each patient. The American College of Rheumatology clinical guidelines for treatment consider the severity of the disease when deciding treatment, but do not include any prediction of drug efficacy. Using Electronic Health Records and Biomedical Linked Open Data (LOD), we demonstrate a method to classify patient outcomes using LASSO penalized regression. We show how Linked Data improves prediction and provides insight into how drug treatment regimes have different treatment outcome. Applying classifiers like this to decision support in clinical applications could decrease time to successful disease management, lessening a physical and financial burden on patients individually and the healthcare system as a whole.",2016,AMIA Summits on Translational Science Proceedings
Symptom network models in depression research: From methodological exploration to clinical application,"Volgens de netwerkbenadering van psychopathologie kunnen mentale stoornissen worden gezien als een netwerk van symptomen die elkaar causaal beinvloeden. Met de netwerkbenadering kunnen we hypotheses formuleren met betrekking tot belangrijke vragen binnen de psychopathologie en behandeling. In haar proefschrift stelt Claudia van Borkulo de volgende vragen centraal: â€œHoe komt het dat bij sommige patienten een depressie weer overgaat, maar bij sommigen niet?â€ en â€œWaarom ontwikkelen sommigen mensen een depressie en anderen niet?â€ Ze heeft deze vragen bekeken vanuit de netwerkbenadering. Om dat te kunnen doen, heeft ze eerst de benodigde methodologie ontwikkeld: eLasso (geimplementeerd in R-package IsingFit) om de netwerkstructuur aan de hand van binaire data af te leiden en de Network Comparison Test (NCT; geimplementeerd in R-package NetworkComparisonTest) om netwerken te kunnen vergelijken. In verschillende validatiestudies laat ze zien dat eLasso een computationeel efficiente methode is die het goed doet onder veel voorkomende omstandigheden binnen de psychologie en psychiatrie. Ook de NCT is in diverse omstandigheden in staat om verschillen te detecteren. Vervolgens heeft ze de methoden toegepast op empirische data waaruit bleek dat de dichtheid van een symptoom netwerk van patienten geassocieerd is met het beloop van depressie. Andersom bleek ook dat centraliteit van depressiesymptomen bij gezonde mensen een voorspellende waarde hebben voor het ontwikkelen van depressie. Hoewel deze resultaten op groepsniveau gelden â€“ en het dus onduidelijk is wat dit betekent voor het individu â€“ bieden de resultaten in dit proefschrift interessante aanknopingspunten voor vervolgonderzoek.",2018,

[The study of the ultrastructure of the female reproductive system in a parasite of bats Allassogonoporus amphoraeformis (Digenea: Allassogonoporidae)].,"The morphology and fine structure of the female reproductive system of allassogonoporid trematode Allassogonoporus amphoraeformis have been described for the first time. The ovary consists of the germ cells being at various developmental stages and supporting cells of two types. The oviduct, seminal receptacle with its short duct and the proximal portion of Laurer's canal are lined by flattened cellular epithelium with lamellae and cilia on its luminal surface and well-developed basal infoldings. The distal part of Laurer's canal and metraterm are tegumental in structure and are characterized by sparse secretory inclusions and lacking of spines. Mehlis' glands of two types open into ootype. The uterus wall is composed of highly flattened epithelial cells surrounded by basal lamina and sparse muscle bundles. Vitelline lobules consist only of the vitelline cells at various developmental stages. The mature vitelline cells contain two types of inclusions: vitelline droplets and rarely scattered lipids. Vitelline ducts are lined by cellular epithelium with highly folded luminal surface and devoid of cilia.

On Convergence of Kronecker Graphical Lasso Algorithms,"This paper studies iteration convergence of Kronecker graphical lasso (KGLasso) algorithms for estimating the covariance of an i.i.d. Gaussian random sample under a sparse Kronecker-product covariance model and MSE convergence rates. The KGlasso model, originally called the transposable regularized covariance model by Allen <etal/> [â€œTransposable regularized covariance models with an application to missing data imputation,â€ Ann. Appl. Statist., vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 764â€“790, 2010], implements a pair of <formula formulatype=""inline""><tex Notation=""TeX"">$\ell_1$</tex> </formula> penalties on each Kronecker factor to enforce sparsity in the covariance estimator. The KGlasso algorithm generalizes Glasso, introduced by Yuan and Lin [â€œModel selection and estimation in the Gaussian graphical model,â€ Biometrika, vol. 94, pp. 19â€“35, 2007] and Banerjee <etal/> [â€œModel selection through sparse maximum likelihood estimation for multivariate Gaussian or binary data,â€ J. Mach. Learn. Res., vol. 9, pp. 485â€“516, Mar. 2008], to estimate covariances having Kronecker product form. It also generalizes the unpenalized ML flip-flop (FF) algorithm of Dutilleul [â€œThe MLE algorithm for the matrix normal distribution,â€ J. Statist. Comput.

We establish that the KGlasso iterates converge pointwise to a local maximum of the penalized likelihood function. We derive high dimensional rates of convergence to the true covariance as both the number of samples and the number of variables go to infinity. Our results establish that KGlasso has significantly faster asymptotic convergence than Glasso and FF. Simulations are presented that validate the results of our analysis.

Fall Ascertainment and Development of a Risk Prediction Model Using Electronic Medical Records.,"OBJECTIVES
To examine the use of electronic medical record (EMR) data to ascertain falls and develop a fall risk prediction model in an older population.


DESIGN
Retrospective longitudinal study using 10 years of EMR data (2004-2014). A series of 3-year cohorts included members continuously enrolled for a minimum of 3 years, requiring 2 years pre-fall (no previous record of a fall) and a 1-year fall risk period.


SETTING
Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, an ambulatory setting.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 57 678 adults, age 60â€‰years and older.


MEASUREMENTS
Initial EMR searches were guided by current literature and geriatricians to understand coding sources of falls as our outcome. Falls were captured by two coding sources: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes (E880-889) and/or a fall listed as a ""primary reason for visit."" A comprehensive list of EMR predictors of falls were included into prediction models enabling statistical subset selection from many variables and modeling by logistic regression.


RESULTS
Although 72% of falls in the training data set were coded as ""primary reason for visit,"" 22% of falls were coded as ICD-9 and 6% coded as both. About 80% were reported in face-to-face encounters (eg, emergency department). A total of 2164 individuals had a fall in the risk period. Using the 13 key predictors (age, comorbidities, female sex, other mental disorder, walking issues, Parkinson's disease, urinary incontinence, depression, polypharmacy, psychotropic and anticonvulsant medications, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis) identified through LASSO regression, the final model had a sensitivity of 67%, specificity of 69%, positive predictive value of 8%, negative predictive value of 98%, and area under the curve of .74.


CONCLUSION
This study demonstrated how the EMR can be used to ascertain falls and develop a fall risk prediction model with moderate sensitivity/specificity. Concurrent work with clinical providers to enhance fall documentation will improve the ability of the EMR to capture falls and consequently may improve the model to predict fall risk.",2019,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society
Bayesian Joint Estimation of Multiple Graphical Models,"In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian group regularization method based on the spike and slab Lasso priors for jointly estimating multiple graphical models. The proposed method can be used to estimate the common sparsity structure underlying the graphical models while capturing potential heterogeneity of the precision matrices corresponding to those models. Our theoretical results show that the proposed method enjoys the optimal rate of convergence in $\ell_\infty$ norm for estimation consistency and has a strong structure recovery guarantee even when the signal strengths over different graphs are heterogeneous. Through simulation studies and an application to the capital bike-sharing network data, we demonstrate the competitive performance of our method compared to existing alternatives.",2019,
Understanding the spectrum of residential energy-saving behaviours: French evidence using disaggregated data,"Analysing household energy-saving behaviours is crucial to improve energy consumption predictions and energy policy making. How should we quantitatively measure them ? What are their determinants ? This study explores the main factors influencing residential energy-saving behaviours based on a bottom-up multivariate statistical approach using data from the recent French PHEBUS survey. Firstly, we assess energy-saving behaviours on a one-dimension scale using IRT. Secondly, we use linear regression with an innovative variable selection method via adaptive lasso to tease out the effects of both macro and micro factors on the behavioural score. The results highlight the impact of five main attributes incentivizing energy-saving behaviours based on cross-variable analyses : energy price, household income, education level, age of head of household and dwelling energy performance. In addition, our results suggest that the analysis of the inverted U-shape impact of age enables the expansion of the energy consumption life cycle theory to energy-saving behaviours.",2016,
Using Convolutional Neural Networks for the Detection of Spinal Transverse Processes,"Introduction: Scoliosis, an excessive curvature of the spine, affects approximately 1 in 1,000 individuals. As a result, there have formerly been implementations of mandatory scoliosis screening procedures. Screening programs are no longer widely used as the harms often outweigh the benefits; it causes many adolescents to undergo frequent diagnosis X-ray procedure This makes spinal ultrasounds an ideal substitute for scoliosis screening in patients, as it does not expose them to those levels of radiation. 
Spinal curvatures can be accurately computed from the location of spinal transverse processes, by measuring the vertebral angle from a reference line [1]. However, ultrasound images are less clear than x-ray images, making it difficult to identify the spinal processes. To overcome this, we employ deep learning using a convolutional neural network, which is a powerful tool for computer vision and image classification [2]. 
Method: A total of 2,752 ultrasound images were recorded from a spine phantom to train a convolutional neural network. Subsequently, we took another recording of 747 images to be used for testing. All the ultrasound images from the scans were then segmented manually, using the 3D Slicer (www.slicer.org) software. Next, the dataset was fed through a convolutional neural network. The network used was a modified version of GoogLeNet (Inception v1), with 2 linearly stacked inception models. This network was chosen because it provided a balance between accurate performance, and time efficient computations. 
Results: Deep learning classification using the Inception model achieved an accuracy of 84% for the phantom scan. 
Â Conclusion: The classification model performs with considerable accuracy. Better accuracy needs to be achieved, possibly with more available data and improvements in the classification model.

[Cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients at Bobo-Dioulasso hospital (Burkina Faso)].,"Cryptococcus neoformans is an important fungal pathogen in immunocompromised patients. A retrospective study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of Cryptococcus neoformans infection in patients admitted to Bobo-Dioulasso Hospital over a 3 year-period. During this period, cryptococcal meningo-encephalitis was diagnosed in 36 individuals. The median age of the patients under study was 34.25 years. There was a male preponderance (24 males/12 females) in our report. Typical presentations were persistent headaches (27 cases/36), neck stiffness (16/36), altered consciousness (14/36), fever (12/36) and convulsions (9/36). Oral candidiasis coexisted with cryptococcal meningitis in 7 patients. HIV serology was positive in all patients. At diagnosis, lymphocytes counts were < 1500/mm3 in 66.66% patients. CSF examination with India ink helped to the diagnosis of cryptococcosis in all cases. Cryptococcus neoformans was associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4 patients. 15/36 patients died within 1 to 29 days after admission. High mortality was related to delayed diagnosis. Cryptococcal meningitis highly contributes to mortality in HIV-infected patients in Burkina Faso and it may occur in patients not severely immunocompromised patients. A need exists to improve strategies for clinical management of AIDS patients in poor African countries.",2004,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique
Forecasting Nord Pool day-ahead prices with Python,"This paper presents a Nord Pool forecast model for hourly day-ahead prices, utilizing the Python software. The model is an autoregressive model based on [1] and the data spans the period from 2004 to 2011. The targets (i.e. dependent variables) are the hourly day-ahead prices for a certain hour during the day while the features (i.e. independent variables) are the prices for the same hour the previous two days and the previous week, the minimum price for the previous day, four weekday dummy variables, including the demand and wind for the actual hour. We test the model in a simple linear regression framework with cross-validation. Next, we utilize regularized regressions including Ridge and Lasso. Â Finally, we utilize a Keras neural network. The models are evaluated with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) criterion, R-square and scatterplots. The results demonstrate that the models perform well and could add value for a market player.",2018,
The returning traveller with fever,"Pyrexial illness is a presentation of most travelassociated infectious diseases, but many common infections such as influenza and pneumonia also occur in the tropics or may be acquired en route to and from exotic regions. Patients may also have chronic or recurrent medical problems that are unrelated to their tropical exposure. In approaching a pyrexial patient, therefore, a general medical history should elicit the presence of underlying conditions, particularly those associated with increased risk of infections such as diabetes, malignancy, HIV infection, splenectomy, and pregnancy. Specific questions about the current illness are listed below. The travel history, both recent and past, is of vital importance. Duration of illness in relation to known incubation periods helps to include or eliminate certain infections. Areas visited and the nature of the travel may suggest likely exposures, e.g. business travel in city hotels has a different risk profile compared with riverrafting adventures.",2006,Continuing Medical Education
Hyperparameter selection for group-sparse regression: A probabilistic approach,"This work analyzes the effects on support recovery for different choices of the hyper- or regularization parameter in LASSO-like sparse and group-sparse regression problems. The hyperparameter implicitly selects the model order of the solution, and is typically set using cross-validation (CV). This may be computationally prohibitive for large-scale problems, and also often overestimates the model order, as CV optimizes for prediction error rather than support recovery. In this work, we propose a probabilistic approach to select the hyperparameter, by quantifying the type I error (false positive rate) using extreme value analysis. From Monte Carlo simulations, one may draw inference on the upper tail of the distribution of the spurious parameter estimates, and the regularization level may be selected for a specified false positive rate. By solving the e group-LASSO problem, the choice of hyperparameter becomes independent of the noise variance. Furthermore, the effects on the false positive rate caused by collinearity in the dictionary is discussed, including ways of circumventing them. The proposed method is compared to other hyperparameter-selection methods in terms of support recovery, false positive rate, false negative rate, and computational complexity. Simulated data illustrate how the proposed method outperforms CV and comparable methods in both computational complexity and support recovery. (Less)",2018,Signal Process.
Bootstrap methods for lasso-type estimators under a moving-parameter framework,"We study the distributions of Lasso-type regression estimators in a moving-parameter asymptotic framework, and consider various bootstrap methods for estimating them accordingly. We show, in particular, that the distribution functions of Lasso-type estimators, including even those possessing the oracle properties such as the adaptive Lasso and the SCAD, cannot be consistently estimated by the bootstraps uniformly over the space of the regression parameters, especially when some of the regression coefficients lie close to the origin. Such lack of uniform consistency poses difficulties in practical applications of the bootstraps for making Lasso-based inferences. In the light of this seemingly negative result, we seek, however, to develop criteria for assessing the relative risks, phrased in terms of their uniform consistency properties, of the various bootstrap methods, based on which an optimal bootstrap strategy may be formulated in an adaptive manner. A simulation study is provided to demonstrate the non-normal nature of the distributions of Lasso-type estimators, and to assess the performances of various bootstrap estimates of such distributions across different values of regression parameters.",2012,
Predicting recreational water quality advisories: A comparison of statistical methods,"Epidemiological studies indicate that fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in beach water are associated with illnesses among people having contact with the water. In order to mitigate public health impacts, many beaches are posted with an advisory when the concentration of FIB exceeds a beach action value. The most commonly used method of measuring FIB concentration takes 18-24 h before returning a result. In order to avoid the 24?h lag, it has become common to ""nowcast"" the FIB concentration using statistical regressions on environmental surrogate variables. Most commonly, nowcast models are estimated using ordinary least squares regression, but other regression methods from the statistical and machine learning literature are sometimes used. This study compares 14 regression methods across 7 Wisconsin beaches to identify which consistently produces the most accurate predictions. A random forest model is identified as the most accurate, followed by multiple regression fit using the adaptive LASSO. Fourteen regression methods were compared for water-quality prediction.A random forest method produced the most accurate predictions of all methods.Adaptive LASSO produced the most accurate predictions of the linear model options.",2016,Environ.

Molecular structure of human KATP in complex with ATP and ADP,"In many excitable cells KATP channels respond to intracellular adenosine nucleotides: ATP inhibits while ADP activates. We present two structures of the human pancreatic KATP channel, containing the ABC transporter SUR1 and the inward-rectifier K+ channel Kir6.2, in the presence of Mg2+ and nucleotides. These structures, referred to as quatrefoil and propeller forms, were determined by single-particle cryo-EM at 3.9 Ã… and 5.6 Ã…, respectively. In both forms ATP occupies the inhibitory site in Kir6.2. The nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 are dimerized with Mg2+-ATP in the degenerate site and Mg2+-ADP in the consensus site. A lasso extension forms an interface between SUR1 and Kir6.2 adjacent to the ATP site in the propeller form, and is disrupted in the quatrefoil form. These structures support the role of SUR1 as an ADP sensor and highlight the lasso extension as a key regulatory element in ADPâ€™s ability to override ATP inhibition.",2017,bioRxiv
Settlement vs. Environmental Dynamics in a Pelagic-spawning Reef Fish at Caribbean Panama,"How are the dynamics of the settlement of pelagic larvae of marine shore organisms into benthic habitats affected by larval production and mortality dynamics, and by environmental (wind and tidal) control of settler delivery? We examined the dynamics of reproduction of the pelagic-spawning fish Thalassoma bifasciatum from that perspective at San Blas, Caribbean Panama. 
 
During Aprilâ€“June 1993, âˆ¼75% of females spawned each day, with mean output per female per day at about one-third the potential maximum. Output peaked several days before the new and full moon, when tides were high during the afternoon spawning period. Daily fluctuations in output were weakly correlated with light (+), swell (âˆ’), and onshore wind (âˆ’) on preceding days. 
 
Settler production (determined from otolith back calculations of settlers' fertilization dates) peaked during the wet season (Mayâ€“November), when winds were light and variable, spawning-period tidal heights were moderate to low, and tidal flows were off-reef at night. These conditions correspond to when most settlement occurs. Settler production was minimal during the dry season (Januaryâ€“March), when onshore trade winds were strong and consistent, and tidal conditions were the reverse of those in the wet season. 
 
Settlement usually occurred in one variably timed pulse per lunar cycle, around the new moon. Variation in monthly settlement strength over 11 yr (1986â€“1996) was unrelated to onshore wind stress during either settler arrival or settler production. The daily dynamics of settlement were unrelated to the concurrent dynamics of wind or tides, or wind dynamics up to a week before settlement. 
 
Settler production was much less continuous than spawning. Wet season settler-production dynamics were unrelated to tidal dynamics, but (weakly) negatively related to onshore wind stress. Although the dynamics of settler production and settlement were similar, bouts of settler production were about twice as long as bouts of settlement. The average lunar patterns of settler production and observed spawning were similar (weakly bimodal). Settlers produced during different lunar phases differed in the length and variability of their pelagic larval durations (PLDs). Fish with different PLDs all tended to settle around the new moon. 
 
Weakly semilunar spawning may reflect effects of weak tidal influences on egg survivorship, or of environmental constraints on adults' spawning capacity that also limit spawning to well below the potential maximum. Dry season trade winds may produce the seasonal low of settlement by depressing spawning or forcing the onshore transport of eggs and larvae. If settlement is transport-dependent, weak variable winds may have little effect on currents during the wet season, or local geography may limit such effects; tidal dynamics may not affect wet-season settlement dynamics because small (<0.6 m) tides produce weak flows. Alternatively, settlement may not be dependent on transport mechanisms. 
 
Short-term settlement dynamics result from both the dynamics of larval survival (as most larvae have near-mean PLDs) and larvae delaying or advancing settlement to settle around the new moon. Larvae spawned at different lunar phases have different patterns of variation in their PLDs but achieve similar relative settlement success. Larvae with extended PLDs may not suffer low settlement success because the inevitable age-dependent decline in survival has smaller effects on relative settlement success than does large monthly variation in the survivorship of fish spawned during different lunar phases.",1999,Ecological Monographs
Pass or Fail? Prediction of Students? Exam Outcomes from Self-reported Measures and Study Activities,"Technical educations often exhibit poor student performance and consequently high rates of attrition. Providing students with early feedback on their learning progress can assist them in self-study activities or in their decision-making process regarding a change in educational direction. In this paper, we present a set of instruments designed to identify at-risk undergraduate students in a Problem-based Learning (PBL) university, using an introductory programming course as a case study. Collectively, these instruments form the basis of a proposed learning ecosystem designed to identify struggling students by predicting their final exam grades in this course. We implemented this ecosystem and analyzed how well the obtained data predicted the final exam scores. Best-subset-regression and lasso regressions yielded several significant predictors. Apart from relevant predictors known from the literature on exam scores and drop-out factors such as midterm exam results and student retention factors, data from self-assessment quizzes, peer reviewing activities, and interactive online exercises helped predict exam performance and identified struggling students.",2018,IxD&A
"Late Holocene environmental change and the record of human impact at Gravgaz near Sagalassos, Southwest Turkey","This paper presents the palaeoecological analysis of a sediment core extracted from the marsh of Gravgaz in the Pisidian Lake District (southwest Turkey).

Mayaud 1 London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK 2 Centre Muraz, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso 3 CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11 are known causative agents of genital warts (GW) but little is known about their epidemiology in Africa. We describe the prevalence of cervical HPV 6/11 DNA among high-risk women in Burkina Faso, and their association with GW, HIV, and other risk factors. Methods 306 women were enrolled. HIV status and CD4 counts were determined. Among other genital samples, a cervical sample was collected for liquid-based cytology using a Cervex swab and the ThinPrep 2000 processor and HPV genotyping using INNO-LiPA genotyping v2. Statistical analysis was conducted using logistic regression. Results HIV-1 prevalence was 40% (123/306). HPV DNA was detected in 55% (100/183) of HIV-uninfected women, 84% (78/93) of HIV-1 infected women with CD4 counts >200 cells/Î¼l and 97% (29/30) of women with CD4 counts â‰¤200 cells/Î¼l (p 200 cells/Î¼l, and 20% (6/30) in women with CD4 counts â‰¤200 cells/Î¼l (ptrend=0.04). 18 women (6%) had GW; there was a strong association between HPV 6 and GW (adjusted OR=6.16, 95% CI 1.25â€“ 30.88, p=0.03) but none between HPV 11 and GW. In multivariable analysis, cervical HPV 6/11 was detected more frequently in women who had genital ulcers (aOR=5.22, 95% CI 1.21â€“22.57, p=0.03), or whose last menses was more than 15 days prior to examination (aOR=2.71, 95% CI 1.07â€“ 6.98, p=0.03). Regular vaginal douching was protective (aOR=0.25, 95% CI 0.07â€“ 0.88, p=0.03). There were no associations with HIV-1 plasma viral load, other STI or bacterial vaginosis. Conclusions Prevalence of HPV 6 and 11 was high in this population and occurred more frequently in HIV-1 infected immunosuppressed women. Vaginal douching and follicular phase of menstrual cycle were protective, which might be secondary to mechanical or hormonal factors, decreasing DNA detection.",2009,
Forecasting the US GDP Components in the short run,"The aim of this paper is to estimate short-term forecasts of the US GDP components by expenditure approach sooner than they are officially released by the national institutions of statistics. For this reason, nowcasts along with 1- and 2-quarter forecasts are estimated by using available monthly information, officially released with a considerably smaller delay. The high-dimensionality problem of the monthly dataset used is solved by assuming sparse structures for the choice of leading indicators, capable of adequately explaining the dynamics of the GDP components. Variable selection and the estimation of the forecasts is performed by using the LASSO method, together with some of its popular modifications. Additionally, a modification of the LASSO is proposed, combining the methods of LASSO and principal components, in order to further improve the forecasting performance. Forecast accuracy of the models is evaluated by conducting pseudo-real-time forecasting exercises for four components of the GDP over the sample of 2005-2015, and compared with the benchmark ARMA models. The main results suggest that LASSO is able to outperform ARMA models when forecasting the GDP components and to identify leading explanatory variables. The proposed modification of the LASSO in some cases show further improvement in forecast accuracy.",2019,arXiv: Econometrics
"[Vaccination against malaria: initial trial with an ant-sporozoite vaccine, (NANP)3-TT (RO 40-2361) in Africa (Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso)].","The vaccine (NANP)3-TT is a synthetic peptide of the circumsporozoite protein (CS) of Plasmodium falciparum coupled to tetanus toxoid (TT) as protein carrier and adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant. The objectives of the study were to assess the immunogenicity and the protective efficacy of the vaccine in an area where malaria is endemic. The study was conducted in a zone of irrigated rice cultivation known as the VallÃ©e du Kou to the North of Bobo-Dioulasso. Malaria transmission is permanent in the VallÃ©e with maxima in July and November. The study was conducted from June to December 1988. It was a controlled randomised, double blind, prospective vaccine trial. A total of 123 infants from 3 to 5 months of age were randomly assigned to three groups. Group I (controls) received three doses of TT alone, group II received two doses of TT and one of (NANP)3-TT and group III received three doses of (NANP)3-TT. These vaccines were administered simultaneously with the Enlarged Program of Immunisation (EPI) vaccines. The clinical parasitological and immunological status of the children was then monitored over a period of five months. No systemic reactions to the vaccine were observed in the infants either immediately after administration or during the follow-up. Minor local tumefactions were observed in only 3% of the children. The vaccine was found to be immunogenic with a peak IgG response at day 75, when 56% (group II) and 60% (group III) showed antibody titres of at least four times that seen at day 0. The response, however, was a short duration; by day 150 the average antibody titres were not significantly different between the three groups. The incidence and the level of parasiaemia and the incidence of clinical malaria were also not significantly different for each of the three groups during the period of the study. The association of (NANP)3 with tetanus toxoid was not shown to be immunologically inhibitive. The results, despite not showing a protective effect for the vaccine (NANP)3-TT, have shown its immunogenicity and therefore suggest that further development of this vaccine may be worthwhile.",1990,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique
Accelerated Block Coordinate Proximal Gradients with Applications in High Dimensional Statistics,"Nonconvex optimization problems arise in different research fields and arouse lots of attention in signal processing, statistics and machine learning.

Job Opportunities and Academic Dropout: The Case of the University of Triesteâ˜†,"Abstract We analyze the factors influencing dropout, defined as not enrolling in the second year of the three years bachelor programs at the University of Trieste. We consider 23,333 undergraduate students available from the University of Trieste records and enrolled in the first year from 2003 to 2010. The probability of dropout is modeled assessing the impact of individual and university characteristics and job placement, including their interactions. Our estimates highlight that all these dimensions are influencing the outcome. With respect to the existing literature we aim at exploring a wider set of possible covariates. We employ the random lasso procedure in order to keep into account the uncertainty due to model selection, which is substantial because of the relatively high number of potential explanatory variables involved. We find, among the other results, that exists a positive effect on the probability of retention of working in the second year of the bachelor program and a negative effect on dropout.",2014,Procedia.

Standard Proteomic Analysis (SPA) in AML: An Integrated Procedure for Discovering Hypoxia and Angiogenesis Patterns,"Introduction The heterogeneity of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a great barrier to finding a cure for the disease. Despite our best efforts, the current classification system based on phenotypes and genetic mutations are insufficient to capture and characterize each AML subpopulation. This could result in a mismatch of drugs for a particular patient, an impediment to drug discovery, and an inadequate understanding of AML biology. A promising solution to this challenge is profiling patient samples using proteomics. However, researchers are restricted in their power to fully interpret this massive proteomic data due to a lack of standard AML-tailored computational procedures. In this study, we developed a cocktail of computational methods to analyze the AML proteomic data in conjunction with clinical data. This procedure, Standard Proteomic Analysis (SPA), is designed to help researchers identify unique patient groups, discover prognostic biomarkers, find drug targets and understand transitions between pathway activation states. We applied SPA to a set of AML proteomic data with a focus on hypoxia and angiogenesis to illustrate its utility. Methods The procedure of SPA is shown in Figure 1. We used Prototype Clustering to estimate the optimal number of patient clusters, and used k-means to obtain the cluster assignment for each patient. Standard Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank tests were performed to examine how patient clustering impacts patient survival, whereas chi-square test was performed to evaluate the association between clinical correlates and the clustering. Principal Component Analysis was used to map the normal samples on top of the patient samples, in order to distinguish normal states from diseased states. To expand searches for drug targets beyond the key proteins, we built a protein network by combining the computationally derived connections from the data using glasso with the experimentally validated connections from public databases (e.g. String and KEGG). All of the results were visualized using an interactive platform Easel, where each patient could be tracked simultaneously across graphs. The example AML proteomic dataset was obtained by assaying 511 new AML patient samples using reverse phase protein array (RPPA). The RPPA was probed with 231 strictly validated antibodies, including antibodies against three hypoxia regulators (HIF1A, VHL, EGLN1) and two angiogenesis regulators (KDR, VASP). The normal bone marrow derived CD34+ cells were used for comparison. Results Using SPA, we first identified four patient clusters with distinct protein expression patterns (Figure 1A). Most patients displayed canonical hypoxic (C3) and non-hypoxic (C2) patterns, featuring high and low HIF1A with opposite expression of the others. The two non-canonical patterns (C1 & C4) indicate a decoupling between HIF1A and its known regulators (e.g., EGLN, VHL) and targets (e.g., KDR). C1 features high HIF1A, EGLN and VHL but low KDR and VASP. C4 is the opposite. The mapping of normal samples to patient samples (Figure 1B) suggested that non-canonical patterns might be disease specific. From the clinical correlates table (Figure 1D), we observed an association between canonical patterns and cell lineage differentiation, with C3 governing undifferentiated FAB M0/M1 cases and C2 dominant in monocytic M4/M5 subtypes. Furthermore, C1 was associated with favorable cytogenetics, but hypoxic patterns (C1 & C3) were adverse factors for overall survival among patients with intermediate cytogenetics (Figure 1C). The expanded protein networks (Figure 1E) revealed an umbrella of proteins in other pathways associated with each of the five proteins, including, e.g. a negative correlation between VASP and apoptosis proteins (BAD, BCL2, AIFM1), which has not been reported before. Conclusions We developed and applied an AML-tailored procedure, SPA, to analyze hypoxia and angiogenesis clinical proteomic data. Using SPA, we were able to identify four AML subpopulations with two disease specific patterns, discover the dependency between cell lineage development and canonical patterns, and explore potential drug targets beyond hypoxia and angiogenesis that are associated with each pattern. We believe SPA could be applied broadly and greatly expedite the drug discovery process in leukemia. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",2014,Blood
Protection from fishing alters the species composition of fish assemblages in a temperate-tropical transition zone,"Closure of areas to fishing is expected to result in an increase in the abundance of targeted species; however, changes to populations of species not targeted by fishermen will depend upon their role in the ecosystem and their relationship with targeted species. The effects of protection on targeted and non-targeted reef fish species at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia were studied using baited remote underwater stereoâ€“video cameras. Video images were collected from shallow (8â€“12Â m) and deep (22â€“26Â m) reef sites inside a Marine Protected Area (MPA) at each of three island groups and from three replicate fished locations at each of these groups that span a temperate-tropical transition area. The MPAs were established in 1994 and vary in size from 13.72Â km2 at the Pelsaert group in the south to 22.29Â km2 at the Easter group to 27.44Â km2 at the Wallabi group in the north. The relative abundances of 137 fish species from 42 families were recorded. Large differences in fish assemblage structure existed between MPA and fished locations, and also between shallow and deep regions. Targeted fish species Plectropomus leopardus, Lethrinus miniatus, Lethrinus nebulosus, Pagrus auratus and Glaucosoma hebraicum were more abundant inside MPAs than in areas open to fishing. Their abundance inside MPAs was between 1.13 and 8 times greater than their abundance at fished locations. For non-targeted fish species many were more abundant in areas open to fishing, e.g. Coris auricularis, Thalassoma lutescens, Thalassoma lunare, Dascyllus trimaculatus, however others were conversely more abundant inside MPAs, e.g. Gymnothorax spp, Kyphosus sydneyanus, Scarus microhinos, Chromis westaustralis, Chaetodon spp. This study demonstrates that the removal of abundant targeted species from an ecosystem by fishing can indirectly impact non-fished species and alter the trophic structure of fish assemblages.",2007,Marine Biology
Safe Active Feature Selection for Sparse Learning,"We present safe active incremental feature selection~(SAIF) to scale up the computation of LASSO solutions. SAIF does not require a solution from a heavier penalty parameter as in sequential screening or updating the full model for each iteration as in dynamic screening. Different from these existing screening methods, SAIF starts from a small number of features and incrementally recruits active features and updates the significantly reduced model. Hence, it is much more computationally efficient and scalable with the number of features. More critically, SAIF has the safe guarantee as it has the convergence guarantee to the optimal solution to the original full LASSO problem. Such an incremental procedure and theoretical convergence guarantee can be extended to fused LASSO problems. Compared with state-of-the-art screening methods as well as working set and homotopy methods, which may not always guarantee the optimal solution, SAIF can achieve superior or comparable efficiency and high scalability with the safe guarantee when facing extremely high dimensional data sets. Experiments with both synthetic and real-world data sets show that SAIF can be up to 50 times faster than dynamic screening, and hundreds of times faster than computing LASSO or fused LASSO solutions without screening.",2018,ArXiv
Prediction Error Meta Classification in Semantic Segmentation: Detection via Aggregated Dispersion Measures of Softmax Probabilities,"We present a method that ""meta"" classifies whether segments (objects) predicted by a semantic segmentation neural network intersect with the ground truth. To this end, we employ measures of dispersion for predicted pixel-wise class probability distributions, like classification entropy, that yield heat maps of the input scene's size. We aggregate these dispersion measures segment-wise and derive metrics that are well-correlated with the segment-wise $\mathit{IoU}$ of prediction and ground truth. In our tests, we use two publicly available DeepLabv3+ networks (pre-trained on the Cityscapes data set) and analyze the predictive power of different metrics and different sets of metrics. To this end, we compute logistic LASSO regression fits for the task of classifying $\mathit{IoU}=0$ vs. $\mathit{IoU} > 0$ per segment and obtain classification rates of up to $81.91\%$ and AUROC values of up to $87.71\%$ without the incorporation of advanced techniques like Monte-Carlo dropout. We complement these tests with linear regression fits to predict the segment-wise $\mathit{IoU}$ and obtain prediction standard deviations of down to $0.130$ as well as $R^2$ values of up to $81.48\%$. We show that these results clearly outperform single-metric baseline approaches.",2018,ArXiv
A coordinate-wise optimization algorithm for the Fused Lasso,"L1-penalized regression methods such as the Lasso (Tibshirani 1996) that achieve both variable selection and shrinkage have been very popular. An extension of this method is the Fused Lasso (Tibshirani and Wang 2007), which allows for the incorporation of external information into the model. In this article, we develop new and fast algorithms for solving the Fused Lasso which are based on coordinate-wise optimization. This class of algorithms has recently been applied very successfully to solve L1-penalized problems very quickly (Friedman et al. 2007). As a straightforward coordinate-wise procedure does not converge to the global optimum in general, we adapt it in two ways, using maximum-flow algorithms and a Huber penalty based approximation to the loss function. In a simulation study, we evaluate the speed of these algorithms and compare them to other standard methods. As the Huber-penalty based method is only approximate, we also evaluate its accuracy. Apart from this, we also extend the Fused Lasso to logistic as well as proportional hazards models and allow for a more flexible penalty structure.",2010,arXiv: Computation
Data-driven approach to Type Ia supernovae: variable selection on the peak luminosity and clustering in visual analytics,"Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) have an almost uniform peak luminosity, so that they are used as ""standard candle"" to estimate distances to galaxies in cosmology. In this article, we introduce our two recent works on SNIa based on data-driven approach. The diversity in the peak luminosity of SNIa can be reduced by corrections in several variables. The color and decay rate have been used as the explanatory variables of the peak luminosity in past studies. However, it is proposed that their spectral data could give a better model of the peak luminosity. We use cross-validation in order to control the generalization error and a LASSO-type estimator in order to choose the set of variables. Using 78 samples and 276 candidates of variables, we confirm that the peak luminosity depends on the color and decay rate. Our analysis does not support adding any other variables in order to have a better generalization error. On the other hand, this analysis is based on the assumption that SNIa originate in a single population, while it is not trivial. Indeed, several sub-types possibly having different nature have been proposed. We used a visual analytics tool for the asymmetric biclustering method to find both a good set of variables and samples at the same time. Using 14 variables and 132 samples, we found that SNIa can be divided into two categories by the expansion velocity of ejecta. Those examples demonstrate that the data-driven approach is useful for high-dimensional large-volume data which becomes common in modern astronomy.",2016,
Melioidosis A Serious Emerging Threat in Bangladesh,"Melioidosis, a pyogenic infection that presents acutely or as a chronic infection, is caused by the soilassociated bacterium Burkholderiapseudomallei. Infection is acquired by inoculation or inhalation and is more common in patients with underlying chronic disease. It is endemic in the tropical belt. Although Bangladesh is not considered as a country where melioidosis is endemic, an increasing number of cases have been reported recently. Definitive diagnosis requires the isolation of B. pseudomalleiin culture from clinical specimens. However, the laboratory diagnosis of melioidosis in Bangladesh and other under-resourced countries is limited by a lack of familiarity with the bacterium and a lack of facilities to accurately confirm the identity of the isolate. It is highly likely that melioidosis is underdiagnosed in this country. There is a need to increase awareness of this infection among clinicians and clinical microbiologists and improve laboratory facilities for the selective isolation and accurate identification of B. pseudomallei. Melioidosis has a notoriously protracted course; cure is difficult without a prolonged course of appropriate antibiotics.

Faceted Exploration of Emerging Resource Spaces,"Humans have the ability to regcognize the real world from different facets. Faceted exploration is a mechanism for browsing and understanding large-scale resources in information network by multiple facets. This paper proposes an Emerging Resource Space Model, whose schema is a partially ordered set of concepts with subclassOf relation and each resource is categorized by multiple concepts. Emering Resource Space (ERS) is a class of resources characterized by a concept set. ERSes compose a lattice (ERSL) via concept association. A series of exploration operations is proposed to guide users to explore through ERSL with more demanding and richer semantics than current faceted navigation. To fulfill instant response during faceted exploration, we devise an efficient algorithm for mining and indexing ERSL. The proposed model can effectively support faceted exploration in various applications from personal information management to large-scale information sharing.",2009,ArXiv
Introduction to the LASSO,"The term â€˜high-dimensionalâ€™ refers to the case where the number of unknown parameters to be estimated, p, is of much larger order than the number of observations, n, that is p â‰« n. Since traditional statistical methods assume many observations and a few unknown variables, they can not cope up with the situations when p â‰« n. In this article, we study a statistical method, called the â€˜Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operatorâ€™ (LASSO), that has got much attention in solving high-dimensional problems. In particular, we consider the LASSO for high-dimensional linear regression models. We aim to provide an introduction of the LASSO method as a constrained quadratic programming problem, and we discuss the convex optimization based approach to solve the LASSO problem. We also illustrate applications of LASSO method using a simulated and a real data examples.",2018,Resonance
Clinical Outcome Prediction Based on Multi-Omics Data,"Predicting clinical outcomes via a set of omics data, consisting for example of genomics, proteomics or metabolomics data requires statistical methods which can deal with the situation of a huge number of covariates vs. a relatively small number of observations. One option is the application of penalized regression methods like the Lasso which also results in sparse models because variable selection is part of the model building process. In contrast to the standard Lasso model, the IPFLasso penalizes the various omics groups (modalities) of a multi-omics data set individually. However, this advantage has to be paid with exponentially increasing computation time, when there are more than two or three modalities involved. In this study, several two-step modifications of the IPF-Lasso model have been evaluated and compared to the original IPF-Lasso and some other competitors by analyzing simulated and real data sets. The results show that for a given data set, the new two-step IPF-Lasso model needs only a fraction of the computation time of the original IPF-Lasso and nevertheless can compete in terms of prediction performance.",2017,
IRMPD Spectroscopy: Evidence of Hydrogen Bonding in the Gas Phase Conformations of Lasso Peptides and their Branched-Cyclic Topoisomers.,"Lasso peptides are natural products characterized by a mechanically interlocked topology. The conformation of lasso peptides has been probed in the gas phase using ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) which showed differences in the lasso and their unthreaded branched-cyclic topoisomers depending on the ion charge states. To further characterize the evolution of gas phase conformations as a function of the charge state and to assess associated changes in the hydrogen bond network, infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) action spectroscopy was carried out on two representative lasso peptides, microcin J25 (MccJ25) and capistruin, and their branched-cyclic topoisomers. For the branched-cyclic topoisomers, spectroscopic evidence of a disruption of neutral hydrogen bonds were found when comparing the 3+ and 4+ charge states. In contrast, for the lasso peptides, the IRMPD spectra were found to be similar for the two charge states, suggesting very little difference in gas phase conformations upon addition of a proton. The IRMPD data were thus found consistent and complementary to IM-MS, confirming the stable and compact structure of lasso peptides in the gas phase.",2016,The journal of physical chemistry. A
A Comparative Framework for Preconditioned Lasso Algorithms,"The Lasso is a cornerstone of modern multivariate data analysis, yet its performance suffers in the common situation in which covariates are correlated. This limitation has led to a growing number of Preconditioned Lasso algorithms that pre-multiply X and y by matrices PX, Py prior to running the standard Lasso. A direct comparison of these and similar Lasso-style algorithms to the original Lasso is difficult because the performance of all of these methods depends critically on an auxiliary penalty parameter Î». In this paper we propose an agnostic framework for comparing Preconditioned Lasso algorithms to the Lasso without having to choose Î». We apply our framework to three Preconditioned Lasso instances and highlight cases when they will outperform the Lasso. Additionally, our theory reveals fragilities of these algorithms to which we provide partial solutions.",2013,
"Winogradskyella rapida sp. nov., isolated from protein-enriched seawater.","Flavobacteria are emerging as an important group of organisms associated with the degradation of complex organic matter in aquatic environments. A novel Gram-reaction-negative, heterotrophic, rod-shaped, aerobic, yellow-pigmented and gliding bacterium, strain SCB36T, was isolated from a protein-enriched seawater sample, collected at Scripps Pier, Southern California Bight (Eastern Pacific). Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the bacterium was related to members of the genus Winogradskyella within the family Flavobacteriaceae, phylum Bacteroidetes. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to the other Winogradskyella species was 94.5-97.1%. DNA-DNA relatedness between strain SCB36T and Winogradskyella thalassocola KMM 3907T, its closest relative in terms of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, was 20%. On the basis of the phylogenetic and phenotypic data, strain SCB36T represents a novel species of the genus Winogradskyella, for which the name Winogradskyella rapida sp. nov. is proposed.

Growth Patterns in Non-syndromic Childhood Overweight: Comparing Children with Early of Late Onset Weight Gain,"1. The EO group had relatively more girls, they were more affected by obesity than the LO group and had later adiposity rebound. 2. From juvenility onwards and at final height, girls of the EO group, and also their mothers, were taller than girls of the LO group. 3. The timing of onset of overweight can be used to distinguish between obese children who are likely (LO) or unlikely (EO) to embark on a trajectory, which leads to insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, and T2D.

Genomic prediction of genetic values for resistance to wheat rusts,"Durable resistance to the rust diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) can be achieved by developing lines that have race-nonspecific adult plant resistance conferred by multiple minor slow-rusting genes. Genomic selection (GS) is a promising tool for accumulating favorable alleles of slow-rusting genes. In this study, five CIMMYT wheat populations evaluated for resistance were used to predict resistance to stem rust (Puccinia graminis) and yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis) using Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (BL), ridge regression (RR), and support vector regression with linear or radial basis function kernel models. All parents and populations were genotyped using 1400 Diversity Arrays Technology markers and different prediction problems were assessed. Results show that prediction ability for yellow rust was lower than for stem rust, probably due to differences in the conditions of infection of both diseases. For within population and environment, the correlation between predicted and observed values (Pearsonâ€™s correlation [ ]) was greater than 0.50 in 90% of the evaluations whereas for yellow rust, ranged from 0.0637 to 0.6253. The BL and RR models have similar prediction ability, with a slight superiority of the BL confirming reports about the additive nature of rust resistance. When making predictions between environments and/or between populations, including information from another environment or environments or another population or populations improved prediction.",2012,The Plant Genome
Moral Opposition to Philip in Pre-Lopean Drama,"No dudo yo, senr, sino que importa regir con dura freno la milicia, y que se de al soldado rienda corta cuando el se precipita en la injusticia. La fuerza del ejercito se acorta cuando va sin arrimode justicia, antique mas le acompanen a montones mil pintadas banderas y escnadrones(Cervantes, La Numancia vv. 57-64)As the Spanish Empire expanded in the second half of the sixteenth century, King Philip II's imperial policies began to change in a manner deemed by many to be immoral and unjust. Moralists and intellectuals of the day chose their own media to express their concern and fear of tyranny as Philip increasingly threatened to use military force to obtain the crown of Portugal in the late 1570s; moral treatises, pamphlets, epic poems, and dramatic works arose to communicate social commentary. Relatively recently, Golden Age scholars have begun to focus more attention on subversive political discourse written by dramatists preceding Lope de Vega (1562-1635) and the rise of the comcdia inteva, concentrating their efforts almost exclusively on Miguel de Cervantes's (1547-1616) La destruccion de Numancia (c. 1583). Furthermore, an increasing number of scholars has analyzed Cervantes's history play as a covert criticism of Philip II's government, rather than the overtly patriotic propaganda derived from a literal reading of the dialogue. In the 1970s, Alfredo Hermenegildo's book-length study La ""Numancia"" de Cervantes, which echoes some of his findings in his 1973 book on tragedy in the Spanish Renaissance, and Willard F. King's groundbreaking article represent two of the first challenges to the generally accepted reading of La Nitmancin as a proimperialistic work. Since then, works by the likes of Frederick A. de Armas, E. C. Graf, Michael Armstrong-Roche, Barbara Simerka, and later studies by Hermenegildo have surfaced that further validate the notion that in the play ""imperial rule is seen in a troublesome light"" (De Armas 130).While Cervantes's play certainly merits the meticulous studies it has received, it becomes apparent that La Numancia serves as only one example of a broader range of theatrical works from the 1570s and 1580s that portray similar derogatory opinions of the Spanish king. Hermenegildo reminds us that this time period contained a great amount of tension between the monarch in Castile and those on the periphery affected by his policies (Antologia 15), sentiments he expresses on other occasions (La tragedia 17; La ""Numancia"" 47; El tirano 14). A thorough investigation of the plays of Gabriel Lobo Lasso de la Vega (1559-1623), Jeronimo Bermudez (1530?-1605?), el canonigo Francisco Augustin Tarrega (1553?-1623), Cristobal de Virues (1550?-1609), Cervantes, and especially Juan de la Cueva (1543-1612), reveals two important points: there existed a very real fear of tyrannical overlordship among Golden Age Spaniards, and the critical discourse contained in these works draws attention to the notion that the reign of Philip II was by no means free from dissenting voices.1Several plays by these writers speak directly or indirectly to their creators' reservations about Philip's shift from his father's policy of Christian Imperialism to the pursuit of a more aggressive Universal Monarchy. Until the 1570s, Philip had continued Charles V's method of not expanding his European territories, at least not at the expense of other Christians. Rather, he seemed to have taken a more defensive approach; but when he claimed the Portuguese crown for himself, this signaled a change in policy and ignited great criticism from many of his subjects, including these playwrights. These writers regarded this new strategy as dangerous and unjustified, as seen by their depiction of tyranny, as well as their illustration in many instances of the consequences of either autocratic rule or ambition.2The injustice of tyranny, despotic rulers, and totalitarian regimes influenced by ambitious courtiers, were popular literary and dramatic themes in the Golden Age. â€¦",2006,Hispanic Review

Financial ratios and bankruptcy predictions: An international evidence,"We study bankruptcy prediction over the international market using Compustat Global database. First, we apply a popular variable selection method, adaptive LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), to select a parsimonious set of default predictor variables. When different market infrastructures are presented, our empirical study demonstrates an advantage in forecasting defaults with the adaptively selected default predictor variables. Second, with selected default predictor covariates, we apply the discrete hazard model to examine the performance for the international market with time varying panel data over different prediction horizons. Our empirical study shows that for Japan market, three predictor variables, including Retained Earning/Total Asset, Total Debt/Total Asset and Current Liability/Sales are selected by adaptive-LASSO method. Such selection results are strikingly consistent for different sampling periods over different prediction horizons. The model using those three financial ratios alone demonstrates strong predictability in forecasting corporate default. For Japan market, the model with adaptive-LASSO selected variables shows superior out-of-sample predictive power over the Altman's Z-score model. On the other hand, for some Europe countries including UK, Germany and France, the equity ratio variable, Equity/Total Liability, is consistently selected across different prediction horizons, whereas, the rest of selected variables are mixed.",2017,International Review of Economics & Finance
Serial Block-Face Imaging by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy,"ABSTRACT Backscattered electrons(BSE) are generated at the impact of the primary electron beam on the specimen. BSE imagingprovides the compositional contrast to resolve chemical features of sectioned block-face. A focused ion beam(FIB) columncan be combined with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) to ensure a dual (or cross)-beam system(FIB-FESEM). Due to the milling of the specimen material by 10 to 100nm with the gallium ion beam, FIB-FESEM allowsthe serial block-face (SBF) imaging of plastic-embedded specimens with high z-axis resolution. After contrast inversion,BSE images are similar to transmitted electron images by transmission electron microscopy. As another means of SBFimaging, a specialized ultramirotome has been incorporated into the specimen chamber of FESEM (3View Â® ). Internalstructures of plastic-embedded specimens can be serially revealed and analyzed by 3View Â® with a large field of view tofacilitate three-dimensional reconstruction.

A pH-sensitive lasso-based rotaxane molecular switch.,"The synthesis of a pH-sensitive two-station [1]rotaxane molecular switch by self-entanglement of a non-interlocked hermaphrodite molecule, containing an anilinium and triazole moieties, is reported. The anilinium was chosen as the best template for the macrocycle benzometaphenylene[25]crown-8 (BMP25C8) and allowed the self-entanglement of the molecule. The equilibrium between the hermaphrodite molecule and the pseudo[1]rotaxane was studied by (1)H NMR spectroscopy: the best conditions of self-entanglement were found in the less polar solvent CD(2)Cl(2) and at high dilution. The triazole moiety was then benzylated to afford a benzyltriazolium moiety, which then played a dual role. On one hand, it acts as a bulky gate to trap the BMP25C8, thus to avoid any self-disentanglement of the molecular architecture. On another hand, it acts as a second molecular station for the macrocycle. At acidic pH, the BMP25C8 resides around the best anilinium molecular station, displaying the lasso [1]rotaxane in a loosened conformation. The deprotonation of the anilinium molecular station triggers the shuttling of the BMP25C8 around the triazolium moiety, therefore tightening the lasso.",2013,Chemistry
Contributions to inference for diffusion processes and robust statistics,"This thesis is composed of two parts. The first part is devoted to inference for discretely observed diffusion processes. We first describe the general methodology of martingale estimating functions and show that this technique is particularly well suited to polynomial diffusions. We then use that theory as a building block to devise a new class of estimators for locally stationary diffusions. The second part of the thesis is concerned with problems related to robustness theory. We derive robust estimators and tests for randomly censored survival data, which arise when the time until a certain event occurs is not fully observable. Then, we study the general convex loss Lasso for the linear model in a high-dimensional setting. We present new bounds for the estimation and prediction errors, and show how these bounds depend on the choice of the loss function through a well-known term in robust statistics.",2017,
"The Lasso, correlated design, and improved oracle inequalities","We study high-dimensional linear models and the $\ell_1$-penalized least squares estimator, also known as the Lasso estimator. In literature, oracle inequalities have been derived under restricted eigenvalue or compatibility conditions. In this paper, we complement this with entropy conditions which allow one to improve the dual norm bound, and demonstrate how this leads to new oracle inequalities. The new oracle inequalities show that a smaller choice for the tuning parameter and a trade-off between $\ell_1$-norms and small compatibility constants are possible. This implies, in particular for correlated design, improved bounds for the prediction error of the Lasso estimator as compared to the methods based on restricted eigenvalue or compatibility conditions only.",2013,arXiv: Methodology

Stepwise Group Sparse Regression (SGSR): Gene-Set-Based Pharmacogenomic Predictive Models with Stepwise Selection of Functional Priors,"Complex mechanisms involving genomic aberrations in numerous proteins and pathways are believed to be a key cause of many diseases such as cancer. With recent advances in genomics, elucidating the molecular basis of cancer at a patient level is now feasible, and has led to personalized treatment strategies whereby a patient is treated according to his or her genomic profile. However, there is growing recognition that existing treatment modalities are overly simplistic, and do not fully account for the deep genomic complexity associated with sensitivity or resistance to cancer therapies. To overcome these limitations, large-scale pharmacogenomic screens of cancer cell lines--in conjunction with modern statistical learning approaches--have been used to explore the genetic underpinnings of drug response. While these analyses have demonstrated the ability to infer genetic predictors of compound sensitivity, to date most modeling approaches have been data-driven, i.e. they do not explicitly incorporate domain-specific knowledge (priors) in the process of learning a model. While a purely data-driven approach offers an unbiased perspective of the data--and may yield unexpected or novel insights--this strategy introduces challenges for both model interpretability and accuracy. In this study, we propose a novel prior-incorporated sparse regression model in which the choice of informative predictor sets is carried out by knowledge-driven priors (gene sets) in a stepwise fashion. Under regularization in a linear regression model, our algorithm is able to incorporate prior biological knowledge across the predictive variables thereby improving the interpretability of the final model with no loss--and often an improvement--in predictive performance. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm compared to well-known regularization methods such as LASSO, Ridge and Elastic net regression in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (Sanger) pharmacogenomics datasets, demonstrating that incorporation of the biological priors selected by our model confers improved predictability and interpretability, despite much fewer predictors, over existing state-of-the-art methods.",2015,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

"Massive point cloud data management: Design, implementation and execution of a point cloud benchmark","Point cloud data are important sources for 3D geo-information. An inventory of the point cloud data management user requirements has been compiled using structured interviews with users from different background: government, industry and academia. Based on these requirements a benchmark has been developed to compare various point cloud data management solutions with regard to functionality and performance. The main test dataset is the second national height map of the Netherlands, AHN2, with 6-10 samples for every square meter of the country, resulting in 640 billion points. At the database level, a data storage model based on grouping the points in blocks is available in Oracle and PostgreSQL. This model is compared with the 'flat table' model, where each point is stored in a table row, in Oracle, PostgreSQL and the column-store MonetDB. In addition, the commonly used file-based solution Rapidlasso LAStools is used for comparison with the database solutions. The results of executing the benchmark on different platforms are presented as obtained during the increasingly challenging stages with more functionality and more data: mini (20 million points), medium (20 billion points), and full benchmark (the complete AHN2).During the design, the implementation and the execution of the benchmarks, a number of point cloud data management improvements were proposed and partly tested: Morton/Hilbert code for ordering data (especially in flat model), two algorithms for parallel query execution, and a unique vario-scale LoD data organization avoiding the density jumps of the well-known discrete LoD data organizations.

Rock material from the Weddell Sea Floor of the South Ocean,"This work is devoted to the results of the joint Russian-German geodynamic research carried out in the Weddell Sea and West Antarctica during cruise ANT-XXII/3 of the R/V Polarstern in 2005. The study of rock samples collected from the sea floor showed that a heterogeneous structure of the Weddell Sea was formed by spatiotemporal combination of the destruction of continental crust, progressive thalassogenesis (oceanization-taphrogenesis), and rifting, as opposed to a spreading origin. High postconsolidation mobility during the destruction stage led to the areal dismembering and high permeability of the continental crust, as well as to tectonomagmatic activation. The main mechanism of reworking of the continental crust is recognized to be the magmatic replacement by basic-ultrabasic mantle material with formation of a secondary oceanic crust and preservation of relics of the continental crust. The Earthâ€™s endogenous activity was driven by transmagmatic fluid flows, which ascended from the melted core and caused transformation of the Earthâ€™s crust and mantle.",2007,Russian Journal of Pacific Geology
Characteristics and Typologies of Production Units in Urban Agriculture in Area of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso),"The urbanization of Burkina Faso produce urban waste in large cities. Some poor urban populations use this waste as fertilizer in urban and peri-urban agriculture. Our study was conducted on sites used in urban and peri-urban agriculture in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). The study aims to characterize the production units and define the typologies of these units. Surveys were carried out with 70 heads of production units in four sites. The data collected concerned the age of the farm manager, the size of the production unit, the level of education and training, the land status, the level of equipment, the nature of the waste. On the basis of these characteristics, the production units have been defined. The results indicate that the age of heads of production units is between 20 and 60 years with an average of 34 years. Only 2.80% were trained in agriculture and 9.10% are educated. 78% of production units are manual and household waste is the most used (38 to 70%). These results highlight a diversity in the production units. Thus, 5 types of production units were defined with greater representativity of type I production units; characterized by a manual production system and a planted area of about 78% of their total area. The size of the fields, the age of the heads of production units, the experience and the rate of development are the factors which discriminate exploitations chiefs.",2018,International Journal of Pure & Applied Bioscience
The Phylogenetic LASSO and the Microbiome: Metagenomic modeling in fecal microbiota transplantation,"THE PHYLOGENETIC LASSO AND THE MICROBIOME: METAGENOMIC MODELING IN FECAL MICROBIOTA TRANSPLANTATION Stephen T. A. Rush Advisors: University of Guelph, 2017 Peter T. Kim Rajesh Pereira Advisory Comittee: J.

Data of the microbiome can currently be collected, leading to possible advances in personalized medicine. In this thesis, we lay down a statistical framework for incorporating metagenomic information in predictive modeling with a view toward synthesis of products tailored to individual patients. In particular, we develop the phylogenetic LASSO ( -LASSO), a form of model regularization which incorporates known relationships between predictors for the purpose of model selection. We apply the -LASSO to a pilot metagenomic study on the e cacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of Clostridium di cile infections.

Predictable spatial escapes from herbivory: how do these affect the evolution of herbivore resistance in tropical marine communities?,"SummaryBetween-habitat differences in macrophyte consumption by herbivorous fishes were examined on three Caribbean and two Indian Ocean coral reefs. Transplanted sections of seagrasses were used as a bioassay to compare removal rates in reef-slope, reef-flat, sand-plain, and lagoon habitats. Herbivore susceptibility of fifty-two species of seaweeds from these habitats was also measured in the field. Seagrass consumption on shallow reef slopes was always significantly greater than on shallow reef flats, deep sand plains, or sandy lagoons. Reef-slope seaweeds were consistently resistant to herbivory while reef-flat seaweeds were consistently very susceptible to herbivory. This pattern supports the hypothesis that defenses against herbivores are costly in terms of fitness and are selected against in habitats with predictably low rates of herbivory.Sand-plain and lagoon seaweeds showed a mixed response when placed in habitats with high herbivore pressure; most fleshy red seaweeds were eaten rapidly, most fleshy green seaweeds were eaten at intermediate rates, and most calcified green seaweeds were avoided or eaten at very low rates. Differences in susceptibility between red and green seaweeds from sand-plain or lagoon habitats may result from differential competitive pressures experienced by these seaweed groups or from the differential probability of being encountered by herbivores. The susceptibility of a species to removal by herbivorous fishes was relatively consistent between reefs. Preferences of the sea urchin Diadema antillarum were also similar to those of the fish guilds.Unique secondary metabolites were characteristic of almost all of the most herbivore resistant seaweeds. However, some of the herbivore susceptible species also contain chemicals that have been proposed as defensive compounds. Genera such as Sargassum, Turbinaria, Thalassia, Halodule, and Thalassodendron, which produce polyphenolics or phenolic acids, were consumed at high to intermediate rates, suggesting that these compounds are not effective deterrents for some herbivorous fishes. Additionally, potential for the production of the compounds caulerpin, caulerpicin and caulerpenyne in various species of Caulerpa did not assure low susceptibility to herbivory.Heavily calcified seaweeds were very resistant to herbivory, but all of these species also produce toxic secondary metabolites which makes it difficult to distinguish between the effects of morphological and chemical defenses. Predictions of susceptibility to herbivory based on algal toughness and external morphology were of limited value in explaining differing resistances to herbivory.",2004,Oecologia
Developing an individualized risk calculator for psychopathology among young people victimized during childhood: A population-representative cohort study,"BACKGROUND
Victimized children are at greater risk for psychopathology than non-victimized peers. However, not all victimized children develop psychiatric disorders, and accurately identifying which victimized children are at greatest risk for psychopathology is important to provide targeted interventions. This study sought to develop and internally validate individualized risk prediction models for psychopathology among victimized children.


METHODS
Participants were members of the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally-representative British birth cohort of 2,232 twins born in 1994-1995. Victimization exposure was measured prospectively between ages 5 and 12 years, alongside a comprehensive range of individual-, family-, and community-level predictors of psychopathology. Structured psychiatric interviews took place at age-18 assessment. Logistic regression models were estimated with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularization to avoid over-fitting to the current sample, and internally validated using 10-fold nested cross-validation.


RESULTS
26.5% (nâ€¯=â€¯591) of E-Risk participants had been exposed to at least one form of severe childhood victimization, and 60.4% (nâ€¯=â€¯334) of victimized children met diagnostic criteria for any psychiatric disorder at age 18. Separate prediction models for any psychiatric disorder, internalizing disorders, and externalizing disorders selected parsimonious subsets of predictors. The three internally validated models showed adequate discrimination, based on area-under-the-curve estimates (rangeÂ =Â =0.66-0.73), and good calibration.


LIMITATIONS
External validation in wholly-independent data is needed before clinical implementation.


CONCLUSIONS
Findings offer proof-of-principle evidence that prediction modeling can be useful in supporting identification of victimized children at greatest risk for psychopathology. This has the potential to inform targeted interventions and rational resource allocation.",2019,Journal of Affective Disorders
Optimization of Neural Networks with Multi-Objective LASSO Algorithm,This paper presents a bi-objective algorithm that optimizes the error and the sum of the absolute weights of a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network. The algorithm is based on the linear Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and provides simultaneous generalization and weight selection optimization. The algorithm searches for a set of optimal solutions called Pareto set from which a single weight vector with best performance and reduced number of weights is selected based on a validation criterion. The method is applied to classification and regression real problems and compared with the norm based multi-objective algorithm. Results show that the neural networks obtained have improved generalization performance and reduced topology.,2006,The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings
A singular ODE related to quasilinear elliptic equations,"We consider a quasilinear elliptic problem with the natural growth in the gradient. Existence, non-existence, uniqueness, and qualitative properties of positive solutions are obtained. We consider both weak and strong solutions.

Early detection of diseases using electronic health records data and covariance-regularized linear discriminant analysis,"The availability of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in health care settings provides terrific opportunities for early detection of patients' potential diseases. While many data mining tools have been adopted for EHR-based disease early detection, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is one of the most widely-used statistical prediction methods. To improve the performance of LDA for early detection of diseases, we proposed to leverage CRDA â€” Covariance-Regularized LDA classifiers on top of diagnosis-frequency vector data representation. Specifically, CRDA employs a sparse precision matrix estimator derived based on graphical lasso to boost the accuracy of LDA classifiers. Algorithm analysis demonstrates that the error bound of graphical lasso estimator can intuitively lower the misclassification rate of LDA models. We performed extensive evaluation of CRDA using a large-scale real-world EHR dataset â€” CHSN for predicting mental health disorders (e.g., depression and anxiety) in college students from 10 US universities. We compared CRDA with other regularized LDA and downstream classifiers. The result shows CRDA outperforms all baselines by achieving significantly higher accuracy and F1 scores.",2017,2017 IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical & Health Informatics (BHI)
Asymptotic of Sparse Support Recovery for Positive Measures,"We study sparse spikes deconvolution over the space of Radon measures when the input measure is a finite sum of positive Dirac masses using the BLASSO convex program. We focus on the recovery properties of the support and the amplitudes of the initial measure in the presence of noise when the minimum separation distance t of the input measure (the minimum distance between two spikes) tends to zero. We show that when ||Ï‰||2/Î», ||Ï‰||2/t2N-1 and Î»/t2N-1 are small enough (where Î» is the regularization parameter, Ï‰ the noise and N the number of spikes), which corresponds roughly to a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and a noise level and a regularization parameter small enough with respect to the minimum separation distance, there exists a unique solution to the BLASSO program with exactly the same number of spikes as the original measure. We provide an upper bound on the error with respect to the initial measure. As a by-product, we show that the amplitudes and positions of the spikes of the solution both converge towards those of the input measure when Î» and Ï‰ drop to zero faster than t2N-1.",2015,
Exploiting Burst-Sparsity in Massive MIMO With Partial Channel Support Information,"How to obtain accurate channel state information at the base station (CSIT) is a key implementation challenge behind frequency-division duplex massive MIMO systems. Recently, compressive sensing (CS) has been applied to reduce pilot and CSIT feedback overheads in massive MIMO systems by exploiting the underlying channel sparsity. However, brute-force applications of standard CS may not lead to good performance in massive MIMO systems, because standard sparse recovery algorithms have quite a stringent requirement on the sparsity level for robust recovery and this severely limits the operating regime of the solution. Moreover, since the channel support is usually correlated across time, it is possible to obtain partial channel support information (P-CSPI) from previously estimated channel support. Motivated by the above observations, we propose a P-CSPI aided burst Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm to exploit both the P-CSPI and additional structured properties of the sparsity, namely, the burst sparsity in massive MIMO channels. We also accurately characterize the asymptotic channel estimation error of the P-CSPI aided burst LASSO algorithm. Both the analysis and simulations show that the P-CSPI aided burst LASSO algorithm can alleviate the stringent requirement on the sparsity level for robust channel recovery and substantially enhance the channel estimation performance over existing solutions.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications
The treatment of bony mallet fingers using a triple K-wire fixation technique,"shown button-holing between the extensor digitorum tendon radially and the extensor indicis tendon ulnarly. There is an associated radial collateral ligament avulsion fragment identified by the stay suture and the dorsal capsule is incarcerated within the joint. Removal of the interposed soft tissue and wrist extension, to relax the long extensors, permitted congruent joint reduction. The extensor hood was not injured and the radial collateral ligament was repaired using a screw-in mini-anchor and a 2.0 mm mini-fragment screw. Normal joint motion and stability was confirmed by comparison with the uninjured side. After wound closure a temporary anterior slab was applied. Physiotherapy was started 2 weeks after the operation. Clinical recovery of function was complete at 6 months post-operatively. Kaplan (1957) described the complex dorsal dislocation of the MCPJ of the index finger. Closed reduction is prevented by incarceration of the torn palmar plate within the joint, together with the lasso effect caused by the metacarpal head button-holing through the flexor sheath ulnarly and the lumbrical tendon radially. Complex anterior dislocations of the MCPJ are exceptionally rare and less well described. Irreducibility of this rare injury has previously been variously attributed to interposition of the dorsal capsule, palmar plate, radial collateral ligament or a junctura tendinum (Lam et al., 2000; Patel and Bassini, 2000). In the case we report, the metacarpal head was button-holed between the extensor tendons and the injury pattern could be reasonably described as a â€˜reverse-Kaplanâ€™ injury. Although successful closed reduction of anterior dislocation of the MCPJ has been reported (Takami et al., 1999), most authors describe the need for open reduction. A dorsal approach permits access to all of the relevant structures. Lam et al. (2000) were unable to extract an incarcerated palmar plate using a dorsal approach alone, but the patient they described had presented 3 weeks after injury. Our recommendation to surgeons faced with this rare type of injury is that closed reduction can be attempted but is unlikely to succeed and open reduction through a dorsal approach is likely to be necessary.",2015,Journal of Hand Surgery (European Volume)
Unifying approach to selective inference with applications to cross-validation.,"We develop tools to do valid post-selective inference for a family of model selection procedures, including choosing a model via cross-validated Lasso. The tools apply universally when the following random vectors are jointly asymptotically multivariate Gaussian: 1. the vector composed of each model's quality value evaluated under certain model selection criteria (e.g. cross-validation errors across folds, AIC, prediction errors etc.) 2. the test statistics from which we make inference on the parameters; it is worth noting that the parameters here are chosen after model selection methods are performed. Under these assumptions, we derive a pivotal quantity that has an asymptotically Unif(0,1) distribution which can be used to perform tests and construct confidence intervals. Both the tests and confidence intervals are selectively valid for the chosen parameter. While the above assumptions may not be satisfied in some applications, we propose a novel variation to these model selection procedures by adding Gaussian randomizations to either one of the two vectors. As a result, the joint distribution of the above random vectors is multivariate Gaussian and our general tools apply. We illustrate our method by applying it to four important procedures for which very few selective inference results have been developed: cross-validated Lasso, cross-validated randomized Lasso, AIC-based model selection among a fixed set of models and inference for a newly introduced novel marginal LOCO parameter, inspired by the LOCO parameter of Rinaldo et al (2016); and we provide complete results for these cases. For randomized model selection procedures, we develop Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme to construct valid post-selective confidence intervals empirically.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Enhancing Security Attacks Analysis Using Regularized Machine Learning Techniques,"With the increasing threats of security attacks, Machine learning (ML) has become a popular technique todetect those attacks. However, most of the ML approaches areblack-box methods and their inner-workings are difficult tounderstand by human beings. In the case of network security, understanding the dynamics behind the classification model isa crucial element towards creating safe and human-friendlysystems. In this article, we investigate the most important featuresin identifying well-known security attacks by using SupportVector Machines (SVMs) and l1-regularized method with LeastAbsolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) for robustregression both to binary and multiclass attack classification. SVMs are one of the standards of ML classification techniques thatgive a reasonably good performance but with some drawbacksin terms of interpretability. On the other hand, LASSO is aregularized regression method often performing comparably welland it has extra compelling advantages of being very easilyinterpretable. LASSO provides coefficients that contribute howindividual features affect the probability of specific security attackclasses to occur. Hence, we finally use LASSO in particular formulticlass classification to help us better understand which actualfeatures shared by attacks in a network are the most importantones. To perform our analysis, we use the recent NSL-KDDintrusion detection public dataset where the data are labeledinto either anomalous (denial-of-service (DoS), remote-to-local(R2L), user-to-root (U2R) and probe attack classes) or normal. Empirical results of the analysis and computational performancecomparison over the competing methods used are also presentedand discussed. We believe that the methodology presented in this paper may strengthen a future research in network intrusiondetection settings.",2017,2017 IEEE 31st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)
Nomogram Based on microRNA Signature Contributes to Improve Survival Prediction of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma,"Objective
Numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in ccRCC and recommended to be used for predicting clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) prognosis. However, it is not clear whether a miRNA-based nomogram results in improved survival prediction in patients with ccRCC.


Methods
miRNA profiles from tumors and normal tissues were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and analyzed using the ""limma"" package. The association between differentially expressed miRNAs and patient prognosis was identified using univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Next, all patients were randomly divided into development and validation cohorts at a ratio of 1â€‰:â€‰1. A nomogram was established based on independent prognostic factors in the development cohort. The prognostic performance of the nomogram was validated in both cohorts using the concordance index (C-index) and calibration plots.


Results
Multivariate Cox analysis identified the 13-miRNA signature, as well as AJCC stage and age, as independent prognostic factors after adjusting for other clinical covariates. The nomogram was built based on the independent variables. In the development cohort, the C-index for the constructed nomogram to predict overall survival (OS) was 0.792, which was higher than the C-index (0.731) of the AJCC staging system and C-index (0.778) of the miRNA signature. The nomogram demonstrated good discriminative ability in the validation cohort in predicting OS, with a C-index of 0.762. The calibration plots indicated an excellent agreement between the nomogram predicted survival probability and the actual observed outcomes. Furthermore, decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated that the nomogram was superior to the AJCC staging system in increasing the net clinical benefit.


Conclusions
The novel proposed nomogram based on a miRNA signature is a more reliable and robust tool for predicting the OS of patients with ccRCC compared to AJCC staging system, thus, improving clinical decision-making.",2020,BioMed Research International
Stepwise Paring down Variation for Identifying Influential Multi-factor Interactions Related to a Continuous Response Variable,"Although several model-based methods are promising for the identification of influential single factors and multi-factor interactions, few are widely used in real applications for most of the model-selection procedures are complex and/or infeasible in computation for high-dimensional data. In particular, the ability of the methods to reveal more true factors and fewer false ones often relies heavily on the selection of appropriate values of tuning parameters, which is still a difficult task to practical analysts. This article provides a simple algorithm modified from stepwise forward regression for the identification of influential factors. Instead of keeping the identified factors in the next models for adjustment in stepwise regression, we propose to subtract the effects of identified factors in each run and always fit a single-term model to the effect-subtracted responses. The computation is lighter as the proposed method only involves calculations of a simple test statistic; and therefore it could be applied to screen ultrahigh-dimensional data for important single factors and multi-factor interactions. Most importantly, we have proposed a novel stopping rule of using a constant threshold for the simple test statistic, which is different from the conventional stepwise regression with AIC or BIC criterion. The performance of the new algorithm has been confirmed competitive by extensive simulation studies compared to several methods available in R packages, including the popular group lasso, surely independence screening, Bayesian quantitative trait locus mapping methods and others. Findings from two real data examples, including a genome-wide association study, demonstrate additional useful information of high-order interactions that can be gained from implementing the proposed algorithm.",2012,Statistics in Biosciences
Correlated Feature Selection with Extended Exclusive Group Lasso,"In many high dimensional classification or regression problems set in a biological context, the complete identification of the set of informative features is often as important as predictive accuracy, since this can provide mechanistic insight and conceptual understanding. Lasso and related algorithms have been widely used since their sparse solutions naturally identify a set of informative features. However, Lasso performs erratically when features are correlated. This limits the use of such algorithms in biological problems, where features such as genes often work together in pathways, leading to sets of highly correlated features. In this paper, we examine the performance of a Lasso derivative, the exclusive group Lasso, in this setting. We propose fast algorithms to solve the exclusive group Lasso, and introduce a solution to the case when the underlying group structure is unknown. The solution combines stability selection with random group allocation and introduction of artificial features. Experiments with both synthetic and real-world data highlight the advantages of this proposed methodology over Lasso in comprehensive selection of informative features.",2020,ArXiv
Robust regression for highly corrupted response by shifting outliers,"Outlying observations are often disregarded at the sacrifice of degrees of freedom or downsized via robust loss functions (e.g., Huber's loss) to reduce the undesirable impact on data analysis. In this article, we treat the outlying status of each observation as a parameter and propose a penalization method to automatically adjust the outliers. The proposed method shifts the outliers towards the fitted values, while preserve the non-outlying observations. We also develop a generally applicable algorithm in the iterative fashion to estimate model parameters and demonstrate the connection with the maximum likelihood based estimation procedure in the case of least squares estimation. We establish asymptotic property of the resulting parameter estimators under the condition that the proportion of outliers does not vanish as sample size increases. We apply the proposed outlier adjustment method to ordinary least squares and lasso-type penalization procedure and demonstrate its empirical value via numeric studi...",2016,Statistical Modelling

On Linear Learning with Manycore Processors,"A new generation of manycore processors is on the rise that offers dozens and more cores on a chip and, in a sense, fuses host processor and accelerator. In this paper we target the efficient training of generalized linear models on these machines. We propose a novel approach for achieving parallelism which we call Heterogeneous Tasks on Homogeneous Cores (HTHC). It divides the problem into multiple fundamentally different tasks, which themselves are parallelized. For evaluation, we design a detailed, architecture-cognizant implementation of our scheme on a recent 72-core Knights Landing processor that is adaptive to the cache, memory, and core structure. Our library efficiently supports dense and sparse datasets as well as 4-bit quantized data for further possible gains in performance. We show benchmarks for Lasso and SVM with different data sets against straightforward parallel implementations and prior software. In particular, for Lasso on dense data, we improve the state-of-the-art by an order of magnitude.",2019,"2019 IEEE 26th International Conference on High Performance Computing, Data, and Analytics (HiPC)"
Isolation of Genes Related to Heterocyclic Compound Degradation from Marine Bacteria,"Dibenzofuran terminal dioxygenase gene or dbfA1 gene and biphenyl dioxygenase gene bphA1 gene are the genes responsible for the first step of aromatic compound metabolism found in various microorganisms to metabolize dibenzofuran and biphenyl respectively. Thalassospira profundimaris strain M01 and Pseudomonas pachastrella strain M03 are the bacteria that had been previously identified to have the capability of degrading biphenyl and dibenzofuran respectively. The purpose of this study is to detect the presence of reported heterocyclic compound degrading genes (bphA1, dbfA1) in these bacteria. Degenerative primers were designed based on the consensus regions of dibenzofuran and biphenyl degrading genes on reported strains. These primers were designed by multiple alignments of genes coding for reported dioxygenases, in order to detect the presence of these genes in bacteria T. profundimaris strain M01 and P. pachastrella strain M03 respectively via PCR. A total of 4 sets of primers were design designated bphA1F1R1, bphA1F2R2, dbfA1F1R1, and dbfA1F2R2 respectively. The primer set dbfA1F2 and dbfA1R2 produced bands on agarose gel with desired size of approximately 1,000 bp indicating the presence of dbfA1 gene.",2013,
A new superfamily classification of the Caridea (Crustacea: Pleocyemata) based on phylogenetic pattern,"Present groupings of Caridea are notoriously unsatisfactory at the superfamily level. Principles of phylogenetic systematics are used to reconstruct 14 monophyletic subgroups of Caridea, based on 19 synaomorphies of adults. The following sequenced phylogenetic classification is provided (main diagnostic character for each superfamily within brackets): 1. Atyoidea (distal lash of Mxp, reduced); Oplophoridae; Atyidae; Pasiphaidae; Agostocarididae; Alvinocarididae; Bresiliidae; Psalidopodidae; Disciadidae; 2. Stylodactyloidea (mandibular palp with 2 segments or absent); Stylodactylidea; Campylonotidae; 3. Eugonatonotoidea (abdominal somite III with dorsal carina bifurcate); Eugonatonotidae; 4. Palaemonoidea (basal segment of antennular peduncle with distolateral tooth); Rhynchocinetidae; Palaemonidae; 5. Nematocarcinoidea (ventral lobe of scaphognathite narrowly triangular); Nematocarcinidae; 6. Pandaloidea (P1 with chela microscoic or absent); Pandalidae; â€œPlesionikidaeâ€; Heterocarpidae; Heterocarpoididae; Dorodoteidae; Thalassocarididae; Physetocarididae; 7. Crangonoidea (incisor process of mandible absent); Barbouriidae; Lysmatidae; Merguiidae, fam. n.; Processidae; Glyphocrangonidae; Crangonidae; 8. Alpheoidea (carpus of P2 with less than 17 segments); Merhippolytidae, fam. n.; Nauticarididae; Alopidae; Bythocarididae; Thoridae; Hippolytidae; Pterocarididae, fam. n.; Ogyrididae; Alpheidae. 
 
The monotypic hippolytid taxon Thorellinae, subfam. n., has been formally diagnosed. A survey of the lower Caridea has furnished 276 enera and 2418 species and subspecies. The new superfamily system is simpler, genealogically informative and more precisely diagnosed than previous schemes. These have failed as general reference systems because they were based on the wrong premises that similarities indicate phylogenetic relationships or can be used to construct a single acceptable hierarchy.",2009,Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research
A Radiomics nomogram for predicting bone metastasis in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients.,"PURPOSE
To establish and validate a radiomics nomogram for predicting bone metastasis (BM) in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer (PCa).


METHOD
One-hundred and sixteen patients (training cohort: nâ€¯=â€¯81; validation cohort: nâ€¯=â€¯35) who underwent prostate MR imaging and confirmed by pathology with newly diagnosed PCa from January 2014 to January 2019 were enrolled. Radiomic features were extracted from diffusion-weighted, axial T2-weighted fat suppression, and dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI of each patient. Dimension reduction, feature selection, and radiomics feature construction were performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Combined with independent clinical risk factors, a multivariate logistic regression model was used to establish a radiomics nomogram. Nomogram calibration and discrimination were evaluated in training cohort and verified in the validation cohort. Finally, the clinical usefulness of the nomogram was estimated through decision curve analysis (DCA).


RESULTS
Radiomics signature consisting of 12 selected features was significantly correlated with bone status (P < 0.001 for both training and validation sets). The radiomics nomogram combined a radiomics signature from multiparametric MR images with independent clinic risk factors. The model showed good discrimination and calibration in the training cohort (AUC 0.93, 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99) and the validation cohort (AUC 0.92, 95% CI, 0.84 to 0.99). DCA also demonstrated the clinical use of the radiomics model.


CONCLUSION
The radiomics nomogram, which incorporates the multiparametric MRI-based radiomics signature and clinical risk factors, can be conveniently used to promote individualized prediction of BM in patients with newly diagnosed PCa.",2020,European journal of radiology
Comparative Profiling of Serum Protein Biomarkers in Rheumatoid Arthritis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.,"BACKGROUND
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a frequent complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), occurring in up to 40% of individuals during the course of their disease. Early diagnosis is critical, particularly given the shared clinico-epidemiological features between advanced RA-ILD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We therefore sought to define the molecular basis of this overlap through comparative profiling of serum proteins in RA-ILD and IPF.


METHODS
Multiplex ELISA was used to profile 45 protein biomarkers encompassing cytokines/chemokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteinases in sera derived from RA patients with/without ILD, individuals with IPF, and healthy controls. Levels of selected serum proteins were compared between patient subgroups using adjusted linear regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and LASSO modeling.


RESULTS
Multiplex ELISA-based assessment of sera from two independent cohorts (VA, ACR) of RA patients revealed a number of non-overlapping biomarkers distinguishing RA-ILD from RA-no ILD in adjusted regression models. Parallel analysis of sera from IPF patients also yielded a discriminatory panel of protein markers in age/sex/smoking adjusted models that showed differential overlap with profiles linked to RA-ILD in the VA versus ACR cohorts. PCA revealed several distinct functional groups of RA-ILD-associated markers that, in the VA cohort, encompassed pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines as well as two different subsets of MMPs. Finally, LASSO regression modeling in the ACR and VA cohorts revealed distinct biomarker combinations capable of discriminating RA-ILD from RA-no ILD.


CONCLUSIONS
Comparative serum protein biomarker profiling represents a viable method for distinguishing RA-ILD from RA-no ILD and identifying population-specific mediators shared with IPF.",2019,Arthritis & rheumatology
Application of fused lasso logistic regression to the study of corpus callosum thickness in early Alzheimer's disease,"We propose a fused lasso logistic regression to analyze callosal thickness profiles. The fused lasso regression imposes penalties on both the l1-norm of the model coefficients and their successive differences, and finds only a small number of non-zero coefficients which are locally constant. An iterative method of solving logistic regression with fused lasso regularization is proposed to make this a practical procedure. In this study we analyzed callosal thickness profiles sampled at 100 equal intervals between the rostrum and the splenium. The method was applied to corpora callosa of elderly normal controls (NCs) and patients with very mild or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. We found specific locations in the genu and splenium of AD patients that are proportionally thinner than those of NCs. Callosal thickness in these regions combined with the Mini Mental State Examination scores differentiated AD from NC with 84% accuracy.",2014,Journal of Neuroscience Methods
Estudi dels factors de risc d'aguditzaciÃ³ de la malaltia pulmonar obstructiva crÃ²nica (estudi EFRAM),"L'aguditzacio de la malaltia pulmonar obstructiva cronica (MPOC) es important en termes de salut i economics. Malgrat aixo, no es coneix quins son els factors de risc o protectors de laguditzacio de la MPOC, ni fins a quin punt els pacients amb MPOC son tractats de forma satisfactoria en referencia a aquests factors. LEstudi dels Factors de Risc dAguditzacio de la MPOC, anomenat EFRAM, va sorgir amb els objectius de respondre aquestes questions.
Es va reclutar una mostra sistematica d1 de cada 2 pacients ingressats per aguditzacio de la seva MPOC en quatre hospitals terciaris de l'area de Barcelona entre maig del 1997 i abril del 1998, i un grup de pacients amb MPOC clinicament estable que havien patit algun ingres previ. Es van obtenir dades sobre els potencials factors de risc (variables sociodemografiques i cliniques, atencio medica, adequacio terapeutica, compliment, estil de vida, i altres) a partir de: questionari extens, mostra desput i mesures antropometriques a lingres; i espirometria forcada i gasometria arterial basal en estabilitat clinica. A partir del Conjunt Minim Basic de Dades dAltes Hospitalaries (CMBDAH), es van obtenir dades sobre els ingressos hospitalaris fins maig del 1999. Es van creuar les bases de dades amb el Registre de Mortalitat de la Generalitat de Catalunya per obtenir lestat vital dels individus seguits i les causes de mort.
Es van reclutar 346 individus (29 dones) amb un total de 404 ingressos; edat (mitjanaÂ±de) 69Â±9, mediana FEV1 31% del valor de referencia i mitjana PO2 63Â±13 mmHg; i 86 controls estables, de mitjana dedat 69 anys i mitjana FEV1 43% del valor de referencia. Vam trobar prevalences de factors de risc d'aguditzacio de la MPOC potencialment modificables de moderades a altes, entre les quals cal remarcar lelevada proporcio dindividus (86%) que no assistia a programes de rehabilitacio respiratoria i el 43% del total que fallava en alguna de les maniobres essencials de l'inhalador. Lestudi de lassociacio entre un ampli ventall de potencials factors de risc daguditzacio i lingres per aquesta causa, tant en un disseny cas-control com en el seguiment durant 1.1 anys, va mostrar com a principals troballes que el major nivell dactivitat fisica habitual sassocia amb una reduccio del risc dingres per aguditzacio de la MPOC, que la infraprescripcio doxigenoterapia cronica domiciliaria sassocia a un augment daquest risc i que existeix un grup de factors clinics que es relacionen amb un augment del risc dingres (els ingressos previs, el baix nivell de FEV1 i el baix nivell de PO2). Daltra banda, no vam trobar associacio entre lingres per aguditzacio de la MPOC i la majoria de factors relacionats amb latencio medica (vacuna contra la grip i el neumococ, rehabilitacio respiratoria, la majoria de farmacs, i compliment amb la medicacio). El percentatge de FEV1 predit es va mostrar relacionat amb el risc dinfeccio bacteriana, i el baix nivell socioeconomic amb un major risc dinfeccio per pseudomones.
Durant la realitzacio de lestudi, sha posat de manifest lescassa recerca existent sobre laguditzacio de la MPOC. Aquesta manca devidencia cientifica dificulta el fer recomanacions i fa palesa la necessitat dinvestigar mes sobre aquest tema. La informacio proporcionada per aquest estudi pot ser util pels plans de salut i guies especifiques de la MPOC.
Exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is important in terms of health and costs. However, there is little information about which are the risk or protective factors of COPD exacerbation and to which extent COPD patients are satisfactorily managed regarding to such factors. The Study of Risk Factors of COPD Exacerbation (EFRAM Study) has the aim of answer these questions.
A systematic sampling of 1 out of 2 patients admitted for a COPD exacerbation in four tertiary hospitals in the Barcelona area, Spain, between May 1997 and April 1998, and a control group of COPD patients with a history of previous admissions, was recruited. All patients completed a questionnaire and performed spirometry, sputum sample, blood gases and physical examination. Information about potential risk factors was collected, including variables related to clinical status, characteristics of medical care, medical prescriptions, adherence to medication, lifestyle, quality of life, and other. Information on re-hospitalizations until May 1999 was obtained from the Minimum Basic Dataset (CMBD). Vital status and causes of death were ascertained through a record linkage with the Catalonia Mortality Registry.
Three hundred and forty-six patients (29 women) with a total of 404 admissions were recruited; age (meanÂ±sd) 69Â±9, median FEV1 31% and mean PO2 63Â±13 mmHg; and 86 stable controls, of mean age 69 years and mean FEV1 43%. We found a moderate to high prevalence of potentially modifiable risk factors of COPD exacerbation, among which it is important to note the high proportion of subjects (86%) who did not attend respiratory rehabilitation programmes and the 43% that failed in some of the essential inhaler maneuvers. The study of the association between a wide range of potential risk factors and admission for a COPD exacerbation, both in the case-control design and in the 1.1 years of follow-up, showed as the main results that: higher levels of usual physical activity were associated with a reduction of the risk of admission for a COPD exacerbation, underprescription of long term oxygen therapy was related to an increase of this risk and that a group of clinical factors (previous admissions, lower FEV1 and lower PO2) was associated with a higher risk of admission for a COPD exacerbation. Moreover, there was no association between admission for a COPD exacerbation and most medical care factors (influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, respiratory rehabilitation, most drugs, and adherence to medication). FEV1 was also related to a higher risk of bacterial infection, and low socioeconomic status with a higher risk of pseudomonas infection.
During the study, we have found that little research exists regarding COPD exacerbation. The lack of scientific evidence makes difficult to make recommendations and reveals that more research is needed about this issue.

De-biased sparse PCA: Inference and testing for eigenstructure of large covariance matrices,"Sparse principal component analysis (sPCA) has become one of the most widely used techniques for dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional datasets. The main challenge underlying sPCA is to estimate the first vector of loadings of the population covariance matrix, provided that only a certain number of loadings are non-zero. In this paper, we propose confidence intervals for individual loadings and for the largest eigenvalue of the population covariance matrix. Given an independent sample $X^i \in\mathbb R^p, i = 1,...,n,$ generated from an unknown distribution with an unknown covariance matrix $\Sigma_0$, our aim is to estimate the first vector of loadings and the largest eigenvalue of $\Sigma_0$ in a setting where $p\gg n$. Next to the high-dimensionality, another challenge lies in the inherent non-convexity of the problem. We base our methodology on a Lasso-penalized M-estimator which, despite non-convexity, may be solved by a polynomial-time algorithm such as coordinate or gradient descent. We show that our estimator achieves the minimax optimal rates in $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$-norm. We identify the bias in the Lasso-based estimator and propose a de-biased sparse PCA estimator for the vector of loadings and for the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix $\Sigma_0$. Our main results provide theoretical guarantees for asymptotic normality of the de-biased estimator. The major conditions we impose are sparsity in the first eigenvector of small order $\sqrt{n}/\log p$ and sparsity of the same order in the columns of the inverse Hessian matrix of the population risk.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
"Aptian-Albian palynologic assemblages interbedded within salt deposits in the EspÃ­rito Santo Basin, eastern Brazil: Biostratigraphical and paleoenvironmental analysis","Abstract The Espirito Santo Basin is a Cretaceous to Quaternary basin located on the eastern continental margin of Brazil and contains important oil and gas fields, most of which are actively being explored. However, few micropaleontological contributions are available, and most of the available information is contained in internal reports of oil and gas companies. This paper presents a biostratigraphical and paleoenvironmental analysis based on the palynology of an Aptian-Albian succession of the Mariricu (Itaunas Member), Sao Mateus and Regencia formations of Espirito Santo Basin. Samples were derived from two wells (BES-01 and BES-02) drilled in the onshore portion of the basin. Among the 24 samples, 18 revealed abundant and diverse assemblages of palynomorphs that included 51 taxa related to continental plants (23 taxa of fern spores and 28 of gymnosperm pollen grains), 4 algae (3 taxa of dinocysts and 1 chlorophicean), and not determined taxa of foraminifera linings, fungi, scolecodonts and acritarchs. Gymnosperm pollen grains are dominant in both wells and are mainly represented by abundance of Classopollis; other gymnosperm pollen grains and pteridophitic spores are subordinate. Biostratigraphic assignments were based on the ranges of guide species mainly in comparison with biozonations established for the Espirito Santo Basin, as well as to other marginal basins of Brazil. The samples of BES-01 were defined as early Albian age, whereas an age from late Aptian to early Albian (without distinction) is assigned for the samples in well BES-02. The dinocysts and foraminiferal linings are restricted to certain depths in well BES-01. A distinctive monospecific assemblage of Subtilisphaera in some samples represents the first identification of the Subtilisphaera Ecozone in the Espirito Santo Basin, which probably represent its southernmost occurrence in the Brazilian marginal basins. The depositional environment was interpreted as a coastal area that was episodically affected by epicontinental transgressions under shallow and restricted conditions. The palynofloral content of the assemblages represent the final presence of the Dicheiropollis etruscus/Afropollis Province, which is documented in several marginal basins of Brazil and Africa and is mainly defined by a gymnosperm paleoflora that was strongly adapted to warm and dry local climate conditions.",2018,Marine and Petroleum Geology
On Testing Continuity and the Detection of Failures,"Estimation of discontinuities is pervasive in applied economics: from the study of sheepskin effects to prospect theory and â€œbunchingâ€ of reported income on tax returns, models that predict discontinuities in outcomes are uniquely attractive for empirical testing. However, existing empirical methods often rely on assumptions about the number of discontinuities, the type, the location, or the underlying functional form of the model. We develop a nonparametric approach to the study of arbitrary discontinuities â€” point discontinuities as well as jump discontinuities in the nth derivative, where n = 0,1,... â€” that does not require such assumptions. Our approach exploits the development of false discovery rate control methods for lasso regression as proposed by Gâ€™Sell et al. (2015). This framework affords us the ability to construct valid tests for both the null of continuity as well as the significance of any particular discontinuity without the computation of nonstandard distributions. We illustrate the method with a series of Monte Carlo examples and by replicating prior work detecting and measuring discontinuities, in particular Lee (2008), Card et al. (2008), Reinhart and Rogoff (2010), and Backus et al. (2018b).",2019,National Bureau of Economic Research
POLLEN ASSEMBLAGES FROM THE TAIZHOU FORMATION OF NORTHERN JIANGSU PROVINCE WITH DISCUSSION ON THE K-Pg BOUNDARY,"The palynoflora from the Taizhou Formation of the Fengcan No.1drill-core in Dafeng County of northern Jiangsu contains abundant pollen.The pollen sequence can be divided into two assemblages and five sub-assemblages.The assemblages are named following Song Z.S. Qian Z.S.(1989).The upper assemblage is called the Ulmipollenites Podocarpidites Jianghanpollisassemblage(after Song Z.S. Qian Z.S.,1989).Its main characteristic is the rich occurrence of Ulmaceae and Pinaceae pollen.Angiosperm pollen types dominate the assemblage,mainly are Ulmipollenites,Ulmoideipites,Subtriporopollenites,Plicapollis with various tricolpate,tricolporate and polyporate pollen.It also contains some rare but significant types,e.g.Paraalnipollenites,Nyssapollenites,Momipites.The most important gymnosperm pollen are Pinuspollenites,Cedripites,and Podocarpidites.Pteridophyte spores are less than pollen and mainly consist of Pterisosporites,Trilobosporites,Deltoidospora,Klukisporites.Based on the vertical changes of Pinuspollenites,Ulmipollenites,Podocarpidites,Trilobosporites etc.this assemblage can be separated into three subassemblages.We are inclined to assign a latest Cretaceous to Early Paleocene age for the upper assemblage considering the co-existence of rare Momipites,Paalnipollenites,etc. and individual Jiangsupollis,Jianghanpollis.The lower assemblage,i.e.Classopolis-ExesipollenitesSchizaeoisporites assemblage(after Song Z.S. Qian Z.S.,1989),is distinguished from the upper one in having more abundant Cretaceous types,such as Classopollis,Exesipollenites,Schizaeoisporites, Pterisosporites.Ulmaceae and Pinaceae pollen generally become much less important than those in the upper assemblage.The abundant Cretaceous pollen suggests a Late Cretaceous age for the lower assemblage. Presence of rare Marsypiletes,Liliacidites complexus,Jianghanpollis and Jiangsupollis suggests that this unit presents the Wodehouseia spinita zone of Late Maastrichtian in its upper part.The lower assemblage can be further divided into two subassemblages according to the percentage changes along stratigraphy.There is no fully convincing evidence to determine the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary level in the Taizhou Formation of the Fengcan No.1Drill-core at the present stage.Since the sharp disappearance or great decrease of Cretaceous pollen types such as Classopollis,Exesipollenites,Schizaeoisporites, Marsypiletes,Liliacidites complexus and the appearance of rare Momipites,Paraalnipollenites etc above the boundary of the two assemblages,it is reasonable to place the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary between the two assemblages,i.e.at the depth of 2774m.If considering the transitional aspect of subassemblage 1-2and a possible sediment hiatus between subassemblages 1-1and 1-2the boundary could also be placed at 2815 m.However,in the upper assemblage individual presence of Late Cretaceous Jiangsupollis, Jianghanpollis implies that the boundary could be moved up at a higher level.It is interesting that at about 2725m within our subassemblage 2-2we found a pollen flora similar to the fifth subassemblage of Song Z.S. Qian Z.S.(1989).Song Z.S. Qian Z.S.(1989)placed their Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary at the bottom of their fifth subassemblage.In other words the depth of 2725min the Fengcan No.1drill-core can be correlated with the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary of Song Z.S. Qian Z.S.(1989).Therefore it seems also reasonable to place the boundary level at 2725mfor the Fengcan No.1 Drill-core.However,up to date we have not seen any reported pollen assemblage that can be correlated with Song's subassemblage except ours from the Fengcan No.1Drill-core.So to place the boundary at the depth of 2747m,the bottom of our subassemblage 2-2will be much easier in practical work. Sampling resolution for the present study is probably too low to find the boundary evidences for the Fengcan No.1Drill-core.We will raise our sampling resolution and search other support evidences in the future Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary study for northern Jiangsu.",2013,Journal of stratigraphy
Reliable factors of Capital structure: Stability selection approach,"Abstract In the extant literature, researchers introduced many variables as potential determinants of capital structure, highlighting the importance of identifying reliable factors as an essential step before constructing a theoretical framework to explain a firmâ€™s capital structure choice. We combine stability selection as a general approach to improve the performance of a variable selection technique with state-of-art variable selection, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), to identify a sparse and stable set of capital structure determinants. Our findings show that industry leverage and profitability are two of the most stable factors of market and book-based leverage of Iranian firms with high-selection probabilities. Compared with evidence from developed markets, we identified liquidity as a new stable factor of market-based and book-based leverage in a point-of-probability view. Moreover, in contrast to prior studies, we found no evidence to prove the stability of firm size for book- and market-based leverage. Also, the stability of assets tangibility as another core factor of capital structure in the literature is not robust to different definitions of leverage. Prediction accuracy measures show that stable-LASSO-selected variables have better in-sample and out-of-sample performance than core factors of capital structure. Further analysis indicates that when we measure capital structure based on long-term debt ratios, assets tangibility can be viewed as one of the most stable factors of capital structure.",2019,The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance

Second order Poincar\'e inequalities and de-biasing arbitrary convex regularizers when $p/n \to \gamma$,"A new Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is developed for random variables of the form $\xi=z^\top f(z) - \text{div} f(z)$ where $z\sim N(0,I_n)$. The normal approximation is proved to hold when the squared norm of $f(z)$ dominates the squared Frobenius norm of $\nabla f(z)$ in expectation. 
Applications of this CLT are given for the asymptotic normality of de-biased estimators in linear regression with correlated design and convex penalty in the regime $p/n\to \gamma\in (0,{\infty})$. For the estimation of linear functions $\langle a_0,\beta\rangle$ of the unknown coefficient vector $\beta$, this analysis leads to asymptotic normality of the de-biased estimate for most normalized directions $a_0$, where ""most"" is quantified in a precise sense. This asymptotic normality holds for any coercive convex penalty if $\gamma<1$ and for any strongly convex penalty if $\gamma\ge 1$. In particular the penalty needs not be separable or permutation invariant. For the group Lasso, a simple condition is given that grants asymptotic normality for a fixed direction $a_0$. For the lasso, this condition reduces to $\lambda^2\|\Sigma^{-1}a_0\|_1^2/\bar{R}\to0$ where $\bar{R}$ is the noiseless prediction risk.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Involving male partners in maternity care in Burkina Faso: a randomized controlled trial,"Objective
To determine whether an intervention to involve the male partners of pregnant women in maternity care influenced care-seeking, healthy breastfeeding and contraceptive practices after childbirth in urban Burkina Faso.


Methods
In a non-blinded, multicentre, parallel-group, superiority trial, 1144Â women were assigned by simple randomization to two study arms: 583 entered the intervention arm and 561 entered the control arm. All women were cohabiting with a male partner and had a low-risk pregnancy. Recruitment took place at 20 to 36Â weeks' gestation at five primary health centres in Bobo-Dioulasso. The intervention comprised three educational sessions: (i)Â an interactive group session during pregnancy with male partners only, to discuss their role; (ii)Â a counselling session during pregnancy for individual couples; and (iii)Â a postnatal couple counselling session. The control group received routine care only. We followed up participants at 3 and 8Â months postpartum.


Findings
The follow-up rate was over 96% at both times. In the intervention arm, 74% (432/583) of couples or men attended at least two study sessions. Attendance at two or more outpatient postnatal care consultations was more frequent in the intervention than the control group (risk difference, RD: 11.7%; 95% confidence interval, CI: 6.0 to 17.5), as was exclusive breastfeeding 3Â months postpartum (RD: 11.4%; 95% CI: 5.8 to 17.2) and effective modern contraception use 8Â months postpartum (RD: 6.4%; 95% CI: 0.5 to 12.3).


Conclusion
Involving men as supportive partners in maternity care was associated with better adherence to recommended healthy practices after childbirth.",2018,Bulletin of the World Health Organization
Semi-Supervised Learning in Network-Structured Data via Total Variation Minimization,"We provide an analysis and interpretation of total variation (TV) minimization for semi-supervised learning from partially-labeled network-structured data. Our approach exploits an intrinsic duality between TV minimization and network flow problems. In particular, we use Fenchel duality to establish a precise equivalence of TV minimization and a minimum cost flow problem. This provides a link between modern convex optimization methods for non-smooth Lasso-type problems and maximum flow algorithms. We show how a primal-dual method for TV minimization can be interpreted as distributed network optimization. Moreover, we derive a condition on the network structure and available label information that ensures that TV minimization accurately learns (approximately) piece-wise constant graph signals. This condition depends on the existence of sufficiently large network flows between labeled data points. We verify our analysis in numerical experiments.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Two-stage computational bio-network discovery approach for metabolites: Ovarian cancer as a case study,"Machine learning and other computational techniques have been applied in identifying biomarkers and constructing computational predictive models for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Most studies focus on large biopolymers such as DNA, RNA and Proteins but small metabolic molecules have received significantly less attention. In addition, studies have focused only on the analysis of classification performance of the biomarkers selected by various feature selection methods but do not consider possible temporal relationship among feature subsets. In this paper, we propose a two-stage bio-network discovery approach for ovarian cancer metabolites. At the first stage, feature selection is carried out using four different selection methods. The best features are selected based on overall best classification performance. At the second stage, Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) is used to model the temporal relationship among the stratified features. The results show that 39 features out of a total of 592 metabolomics features selected by the Least Angle Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) feature selection method yielded the highest predictive accuracy of 93%. Two DBN methods are then used to model the temporal relationships among the 39 features. The results show consistently significant relationships between the cancer biomarkers at features 219 and 225, and between features 543 and 219 across time points. Among these metabolites, around 20 metabolic chemical compounds have been identified, which could be regarded as potential biomarkers associated with ovarian cancer.",2014,IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI)
