Views and Reviews,"disciplines would be, arguably, antithetical to its practice. Despite improvisationâ€™s dynamic ambiguity and resistance to definitional fixity, however, the discursive field surrounding it is charged by a theoretical tension. On the one hand, improvisation is often characterized as a potentially liberating, emancipatory force from orthodoxy, convention, and the status quo. On the other hand, improvisation is seen to rely on the pleasurable return of the familiar, on the mimetic pleasure of recognition and reappropriation, operating under the guise of artistic freedom. In The Philosophy of Improvisation, Gary Peters accounts for these divergent views by proposing a continuum of improvisational forms from the canny to the uncanny. Canniness (Heimlich) refers to an understanding of the art form in relation to an economy of consumption in pursuit of â€œa spectacle of freedom and expressionâ€ and a â€œfundamental athomeness both within the given forms of improvisation and the cultural milieu in which they are promoted and consumedâ€ (120). Uncanniness (Unheimlich), on the other hand, points to improvisationâ€™s subversive and perhaps emancipatory potential in its ability to unsettle â€œthe given with all of its overbearing familiarityâ€ (120). Petersâ€™s theoretical framework for improvisational activity nicely encases the articles that comprise this issueâ€™s Views and Reviews. Together, these articles demonstrate a range of possibilities for improvisation, whether as a community-building force that generates dialogue and collectivity or as a means of interrogating disciplinary â€œgivensâ€ in order to find a â€œway forward.â€ In â€œA Way Forward,â€ musician Joe Sorbara charts how his interdisciplinary improvisational work with corporeal mime Julie Lassonde provided a way of unlocking the assumptions that undergird their respective disciplines and discovering the performative possibilities of sound and gesture such that both become equally relevant and equally at play for the musician and the dancer. That improvisation can be, paradoxically, an impediment to artistic innovation, despite being an indispensible method of theatrical devising, is evident in Gyllian Rabyâ€™s article on the â€œCommotionâ€ project with Niagara youth. Raby trenchantly captures some of the ideological pitfalls of improvisational â€œcanninessâ€ when left to its own devices and assesses how the RSVP method can redirect a reversion to the familiar and the predictable. On the topic of devising, Aida JordÃ£o reviews Collective Creation, Collaboration and Devising, edited by Bruce Barton. Bartonâ€™s collection provides a vital compendium of work on and by Canadian theatre artists who employ a range of devising methods that present, as JordÃ£o says, â€œan alternative to ... the conventional one-author play as a starting Views and Reviews",2010,Canadian Theatre Review
Forecasting and trading the EUR/USD exchange rate with stochastic Neural Network combination and time-varying leverage,"The motivation of this paper is to investigate the use of a Neural Network (NN) architecture, the Psi Sigma Neural Network (PSN), when applied to the task of forecasting and trading the Euro/Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate using the European Central Bank (ECB) fixing series and to explore the utility of Kalman Filters in combining NN forecasts. This is done by benchmarking the statistical and trading performance of PSN with a Naive Strategy, an Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model and two different NN architectures, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Recurrent Network (RNN). We combine our NN forecasts with Kalman Filter, a traditional Simple Average, the Bayesian Average, the Granger-Ramanathan's Regression Approach (GRR) and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Finally, we apply a time-varying leverage strategy based on RiskMetrics volatility forecasts in order to further improve the forecasting performance of our models and combinations. The statistical and trading performance of our models is estimated throughout the period of 2002-2010, using the last two years for out-of-sample testing. In terms of our results, the PSN outperforms all models' individual performances in terms of statistical accuracy and trading performance. The forecast combinations also present improved empirical evidence, with Kalman Filters outperforming by far its benchmarks. We also note that after the application of the time varying leverage, all models except ARMA show a substantial increase in their trading performance.",2012,Decis. Support Syst.
"Thalassomonas ganghwensis sp. nov., isolated from tidal flat sediment.","A Gram-negative, aerobic, halophilic bacterium, designated strain JC2041(T), was isolated from a sediment sample of getbol, the Korean tidal flat. Results of 16S rDNA sequence analyses indicated a moderate relationship to Thalassomonas viridans within the gamma-Proteobacteria (94.9 % similarity). Depending on the tree-making algorithm used, the isolate either formed a monophyletic clade with T. viridans or was recovered as a sister group of a class containing the genera Thalassomonas and Colwellia. Phenotypic features of the getbol isolate were similar to those of T. viridans, but several physiological and chemotaxonomic properties, including nitrate reduction, amylase, lecithinase, Tweenase and utilization of 13 carbon sources, distinguished strain JC2041(T) from T. viridans. The polyphasic data presented in this study indicate that the isolate should be classified as a novel species in the genus Thalassomonas. The name Thalassomonas ganghwensis sp. nov. is therefore proposed for the getbol isolate; the type strain is JC2041(T) (=IMSNU 14005(T)=KCTC 12041(T)=DSM 15355(T)).",2004,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Regresi Kuantil Bayesian Dengan Penalti Adaptif Lasso Untuk Estimasi Pengaruh Pendidikan Terhadap Pendapatan Di Provinsi Sulawesi Selatan,"Pendidikan diharapkan dapat mendorong peningkatan produktivitas 
yang pada akhirnya bermuara pada peningkatan pendapatan masyarakat. 
Hubungan antara pendidikan dan pendapatan dapat dianalisis dengan 
persamaan Mincer. Studi ini bertujuan untuk meneliti hubungan antara lama 
sekolah (variabel yang mewakili pendidikan) dan potensi pengalaman 
(umur - lama sekolah) terhadap pendapatan. Pengaruh pendidikan terhadap 
pendapatan digambarkan oleh koefisien dari variabel lama sekolah yang 
umumnya dikenal sebagai return pendidikan. Regresi kuantil digunakan 
dalam penelitian ini untuk melihat efek pendidikan terhadap pendapatan 
pada berbagai tingkatan kuantil, bukan hanya pada ukuran pemusatan 
distribusi dari pendapatan. Persamaan Mincer ditaksir menggunakan tiga 
pendekatan, yaitu: (i) Quantile Regression (QR), (ii) Bayesian Quantile 
Regression (BQR), dan (iii) Bayesian Adaptive Lasso Quantile Regression 
(BALQR). Metode BALQR ini adalah perluasan dari metode BQR dengan 
memberikan penalti yang berbeda pada setiap koefisien regresi. Invers 
gamma digunakan sebagai distribusi prior untuk parameter penalti. Data 
yang digunakan untuk penelitian ini adalah hasil survei angkatan kerja 
nasional (SAKERNAS) 2014 di Provinsi Sulawesi Selatan. Hasil studi 
menunjukkan bahwa metode BALQR relatif lebih baik dibanding dengan 
dua metode lainnya berdasarkan hasil backtesting dan perbandingan nilai 
standar error. Selain itu, terdapat perbedaan plot garis regresi kuantil untuk 
sektor pertanian dan jasa-jasa. Return pendidikan pada sektor pertanian 
relatif sama antar kuantil sementara pada sektor jasa return pendidikan 
antar kuantil sebagian besar berbeda secara signifikan.

Education plays an important role toward the increasing in 
productivity and earning. Using so-called mincer earning function, we 
investigated the effect of education and earning. This study using years of 
schooling (interpretation of education) and potensial experience as 
predictor variables. Effect of education represented by coefficient of 
variable years of schooling, commonly known as return to education. With 
quantile regression, allowing to specify the effect of covariate at different 
quantile levels not only at the center of its distribution, but also at its 
spread. We employed three methods to estimate parameters in mincer 
equation: (i) Quantile Regression (QR), (ii) Bayesian Quantile Regression 
(BQR) and (iii) Bayesian Adaptive Lasso Quantile Regression (BALQR). 
The latter method extends the bayesian Lasso penalty term by employing 
different penalty function with an adaptive tuning parameter accomodated 
in the inverse gamma prior distribution. Data used in this paper is samples 
from workers in agricultural and services sectors in South Sulawesi. 
Empirical results showed that BALQR relative outperformed over BQR and 
QR because it resulted better in backtesting and smaller standart error (SE). 
In addition, there are different pattern quantile regression line for 
agricultural and services sectors. Return to education in agricultural sector 
in most of quantile of earning are not different. More over, return to

Salvaging lowermost deployment of an acurate device during transcatheter aortic valve replacement with balloon and lasso pull techniques.,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), also known as transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), is being used with increasing frequency in patients with severe aortic stenosis at high or prohibitive surgical risk. A number of devices are becoming available for TAVR, and competence in using them is mandatory to maximize the safety and efficacy of TAVR, while individualizing device selection in keeping with patient features. The ACURATE TF is a novel promising device for transfemoral TAVR. However, its peculiar features may require additional maneuvers in case of complications. We hereby report the case of a patient undergoing transfemoral TAVR with the ACURATE TF device, in whom lowermost deployment was complicated by massive aortic regurgitation. With two separate remedial actions, the balloon pull and lasso techniques, we were able to pull back the device and significantly reduce post-TAVR aortic regurgitation. Awareness of this complication and the possible use of these two techniques may increase the safety and efficacy of TAVR with this and other new devices.

Encouraging self-development. Profile: Louise Lassonde.,"
 A profile of Louise Lassonde, population advisor to the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) portrays her ethnic and educational background, her interests, and achievements. She was born a French Canadian near Montreal and earned a degree in anthropology with an emphasis on the ancient cultures of Peru. A second degree was earned in sociology and a Ph.D. in demography. In her investigations, it was discovered that there were few remnants of the old Indian culture remaining in the Andean highlands; Quechua and Spanish languages were learned in the process. Her professional responsibilities have included university teaching in development and demography in Montreal, development assistance work in Burundi, Rwanda, and eastern Zaire as regional director for a Canadian nongovernmental organization, and consultancy activities for UNICEF and UNFPA. As a consultant, she was engaged in studying women and their ways of generating income and improving the quality of their lives. In 1989, her position was as country director to Togo and Benin within the UN Population Fund followed by a position in the UNCED secretariat in Geneva. Her field experience has contributed to a view that time is precious and that there is accountability for action or inaction. A little bit of effort can go a long way, i.e., improved management and information and good will. The assumption is that people have the will and desire to improve their own and their families as long as there is hope and freedom from a discouraging atmosphere. Lack of understanding can create tremendous barriers. The example is given of a man presenting with malaria at an African health center and not being treated because of his tribal affiliation; he died when medicine was within reach. Support must be provided in terms of health and education so that people can set the targets for themselves and develop creative solutions compatible with their own cultures. Her positive approach is visible in her insistence that population issues be included in preparatory documents. She helped prepare a chapter in Agenda 21, the draft action plan for the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro which established the principle of stabilization of world population.

Modeling Brain Connectivity with Graphical Models on Frequency Domain,"Multichannel electroencephalograms (EEGs) have been widely used to study cortical connectivity during acquisition of motor skills. In this paper, we introduce copula Gaussian graphical models on spectral domain to characterize dependence in oscillatory activity between channels. To obtain a simple and robust representation of brain connectivity that can explain the most variation in the observed signals, we propose a framework based on maximizing penalized likelihood with Lasso regularization to search for the sparse precision matrix. To address the optimization problem, graphical Lasso, Ledoit-Wolf and sparse estimation of a covariance matrix (SPCOV) algorithms were modified and implemented. Simulations show the benefit of using the proposed algorithms in terms of robustness and small estimation errors. Furthermore, analysis of the EEG data in a motor skill task conducted using algorithms of modified graphical LASSO and Ledoit-Wolf, reveal a sparse pattern of brain connectivity among cortices which is consistent with the results from other work in the literature.",2018,arXiv: Applications
"Urban Dwellers, Politicians And Dirt: An Anthropology Of Everyday Governance In Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso)","The social, anthropological and political questions posed by the provision of a public urban-sanitation and waste-management service offer an excellent opportunity for the analysis of an everyday situation of urban governance. A social-anthropological study conducted over a period of two years in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso made it possible to identify and describe in detail the local actors involved in the area of urban sanitation, their concerns and interaction. This chapter focuses on a particularly interesting point that emerged from the study, i.e. the symbolic political legitimacy that the management of the urban public space by the services representing the municipal authority has for urban dwellers. The dirtiness of the city is a form of?clearly informal, but real?political opposition aimed directly at the concrete symbols close to the municipal power and its representatives. The reasoning is that if refuse creates dirt, then ?one can make use of it to dirty?.

Understanding hedge fund alpha using replication methodologies,"Abstract: In this paper we estimate alpha for major hedge fund indexes.Â  To set the stage for estimating alpha, we examine several alternative methods for replicating Hedge Fund Research Inc. hedge fund indexes.Â  The replication methods include stepwise regression,variations of the lasso shrinkage method, principal component regression, partial least squares regression, and dynamic linear regression.Â  We find that the lasso methods and dynamic regression are superior for generating hedge fund index replications and that the performance of the replications corresponds closely to that of the respective actual indexes.Â  Using these superior replications provides us with a solid platform for estimating alpha.Â  We find that at the height of the financial crisis the alphas computed with our methods generally were negative, in early 2009 when the stock market was rising alphas were generally positive, and inthe current environment of low volatility and low interest rates the alphas computed with our methods generally are close to zero and tend to exhibit low volatility.",2014,The Journal of Alternative Investments
Isotopic and palynological evidence for a new Early Jurassic environmental perturbation,"The Early Jurassic Epoch was a predominantly greenhouse phase of Earth history, but a comprehensive understanding of its climate dynamics is hampered by a lack of high resolution multi-proxy environmental records. Here we report a geologically brief (approximately several hundred thousand years) negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) of 2â€“3â€° in both marine and terrestrial materials, recognised for the first time for the Late Sinemurian Substage (Early Jurassic, ~ 194 Ma) of eastern England. The Late Sinemurian carbon isotope excursion, which is termed the S-CIE herein, is accompanied by peaks in the abundance of the pollen grain Classopollis classoides and the dinoflagellate cyst Liasidium variabile. Classopollis classoides was thermophilic and is a reliable proxy for hot/warm climatic conditions. Liasidium variabile is interpreted as thermophilic and eutrophic using multivariate statistics, its fluorescence properties being similar to living heterotrophic dinoflagellate cysts, and its association with C. classoides. Moreover, the morphological and ecological similarities of L. variabile to the Cenozoic genus Apectodinium are noteworthy. The co-occurrence of the acmes of C. classoides and L. variabile with a negative CIE is interpreted here as having wide geographical significance due to the marine and terrestrial carbon isotope signals being precisely in phase within an open marine setting. This is consistent with an oceanicâ€“atmospheric injection of isotopically-light carbon, coupled with global warming and increased marginal marine nutrient supply, possibly the result of increased precipitation due to an enhanced hydrological cycle or a seasonally-stratified water column. A probable sea level rise of at least regional extent has been identified at the L. variabile event in other records, which supports this putative phase of global warming. All these features are common to the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum (PETM, ~ 56 Ma), and there are also similarities with the Early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE, ~ 182 Ma).",2013,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"
"The Lasso with Nearly Orthogonal Latin Hypercube Designs ( February 19 , 2013 )","We consider the Lasso problem when the input values need to take multiple levels. In this situation, we propose to use nearly orthogonal Latin hypercube designs, originally motivated by computer experiments, to significantly enhance the variable selection accuracy of the Lasso. The use of such designs ensures small column-wise correlations in variable selection and gives flexibility in identifying nonlinear effects in the model. Systematic methods for constructing such designs are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by several numerical examples.",2013,
Abstract IA15: Predicting drug sensitivity from cancer cell lines,"High-throughput molecular characterization technologies have enabled detailed genetic and genomic characterization of large panels of cancer cell lines, including profiling of gene expression, copy number variation (CNV), SNP, mutation, and RNA-seq. The same cell lines have also been profiled for sensitivity to potential anti-cancer compounds, allowing development of computational models used to predict genotype-specific drug treatments linked to tumor molecular subtypes. Inferring such models is challenging because the model inputs contain far more features than observations, known as the p>>n problem, precluding the use of classical statistical models such as least squares (a.k.a. multiple linear regression). Recently, generalized linear models or penalized linear models have been proposed and extended for feature selection and overcoming the p>>n. Bayesian extension of such methods have also been developed, using algorithms such as Metropolis-Hasting and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and demonstrated to improve prediction accuracy at the expense of increased computing cost. A comprehensive evaluation of predictive modeling techniques is essential to leverage cell line studies to infer the most accurate genetic predictors of drug sensitivity, which can then be used to inform patient selection strategies in clinical trials and to identify functional genetic determinants of drug sensitivity or resistance. In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art predictive models which utilize dimension reduction methods (e.g., partial least square, support vector machine, principal component regression), feature selection (e.g., LASSO, RIDGE, and elastic-net), and Bayesian feature selection (e.g., Bayesian LASSO and Bayesian RIDGE). We assess each method based on 1) the accuracy of sensitivity predictions in a cross validation setting and in an independent dataset, and 2) the biological coherence of inferred predictive features by comparison to publicly available pathway databases.

The Cost of Type II Diabetes Mellitus: A Machine Learning Perspective,"In this study, the burden of type II diabetes mellitus is investigated using machine learning methods. In particular, it is mainly aimed at obtaining an accurate quantification of the burden of diabetes by computing the number of indicators that provide the highest discrimination rate between normal people and patients. Assuming that the cardinality of the best-fitting feature set can be used to quantify the magnitude of the overall burden, several healthcare related features are extracted from demographic, diagnosis, medication and lab test records. Experimental results have shown that there are about 200 relevant indicators and the highest classification performance achieved in discriminating diabetic and normal people is remarkably superior to that of the baseline system. In other words, the burden of diabetes is not limited to a small group of complications, medications or lab tests. In the second phase of experiments, the relative effects of different indicators are evaluated by employing Lasso and Ridge regression algorithms. It is observed that the best set of indicators have different levels of effects in discriminating between diabetic and normal people.",2016,
Mercury levels and potential risk from subsistence foods from the Aleutians.,"Considerable attention has been devoted to contaminants (mainly PCBs and mercury) in subsistence foods (particularly fish) from various parts of the world. However, relatively little attention has been devoted to examining mercury levels in a full range of subsistence foods from a particular region. While managers and scientists compute risk based on site-specific data on contaminant levels and consumption rates, a first step in making risk decisions by subsistence peoples is knowledge about the relative levels of mercury in the foods they eat. This study examined levels of mercury in subsistence foods (edible components) from several islands in the western Aleutians of Alaska, including algae (4 species), invertebrates (9 species), fish (15 species) and birds (5 species). Samples were gathered by both subsistence hunters/fishers and by scientists using the same equipment. Another objective was to determine if there were differences in mercury levels in subsistence foods gathered from different Aleutian islands. We tested the null hypotheses that there were no interspecific and interisland differences in mercury levels. Because of variation in distribution and the nature of subsistence hunting and fishing, not all organisms were collected from each of the islands. There were significant and important differences in mercury levels among species, but the locational differences were rather small. There was an order of magnitude difference between algae/some invertebrates and fish/birds. Even within fish, there were significant differences. The highest mean mercury levels were in flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon, 0.277 ppm), yellow irish lord (Hemilepidotus jardani, 0.281 ppm), great sculpin (Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus, 0.366 ppm), glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens, 0.329 ppm) and its eggs (0.364 ppm), and pigeon guillemot (Cepphus columba, 0.494 ppm). Mercury levels increased with increasing weight of the organisms for limpets (Tectura scutum), and for 11 of the 15 fish species examined. Nine of the 15 fish species had some samples over the 0.3 ppm level, and 7 of 15 fish had some samples over 0.5 ppm. For birds, 95% of the pigeon guillemot muscle samples were above the 0.3 ppm, and 43% were above 0.5 ppm. While health professionals may argue about the risk and benefits of eating fish, and of eating alternative protein sources, the public should be provided with enough information for them to make informed decisions. This is particularly true for subsistence people who consume large quantities of self-caught foods, particularly for sensitive sub-populations, such as pregnant women. We argue that rather than giving people blanket statements about the health benefits or risks from eating fish, information on mean and maximum mercury levels should also be provided on a wide range of subsistence foods, allowing informed decisions, especially by those most at risk.",2007,The Science of the total environment
Deconvolution of fMRI BOLD signal in time-domain using an exponential operator and Lasso optimization,"Many techniques have been explored so far in the study of neural activations using the blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) signal. Among them, deconvolution methods have been developed in order to explore spontaneous brain activity when the brain is in resting-state. These techniques are powerful since they do not require a priori knowledge about timing and duration of activations [2]. In this work, we propose a regularized deconvolution technique which uses an exponential operator, whose shape and performance can be adjusted by tuning a parameter Î±, and the Least-Angle Regression (LARS) algorithm, by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model.",2017,
Nonasymptotic Analysis of Semiparametric Regression Models with High-Dimensional Parametric Coefficients,"We consider a two-step projection based Lasso procedure for estimating a partially linear regression model where the number of coefficients in the linear component can exceed the sample size and these coefficients belong to the l_{q}-â€œballsâ€ for q in [0, 1]. Our theoretical results are nonasymptotic and include the upper bounds on the l_{2}-errors of the proposed estimators and a result on variable selection. In particular, we establish a new non-asymptotic â€œoracleâ€ result: Although the prediction error of the nonparametric projection per se has the scaling t_{n} in the first step, it only contributes a scaling of t_{n}^{2} in the l_{2}-error of the second-step estimator for the linear coefficients. This new â€œoracleâ€ result holds for a unified framework of nonparametric least squares procedures and regularized nonparametric least squares procedures for the first-step estimation and the driver behind it lies in the projection strategy. We specialize our analysis to the estimation of a semiparametric sample selection model and provide a simple method with theoretical guarantees for choosing the regularization parameter in practice.",2017,Annals of Statistics
Palatability and defense of some tropical infaunal worms: alkylpyrrole sulfamates as deterrents to fish feeding,"Numerous studies have investigated chemical defenses among sessile species growing on hard substrates, but few have addressed this for mobile species in soft-sediment communities. We investigated the palatability and potential chemical defenses of 11 worm species from soft-sediment systems in southern Florida, USA. Three species were unpalatable to the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum. The polychaete Cirriformia tentaculata and the hemichordate Ptychodera bahamensis were uniformly unpalatable. For the polychaete Eupolymnia crassicornis, the exposed tentacles were unpalatable, but the body, which remains protected in a deeply buried tube, was palatable. These unpalatable worms were chemically defended; extracts of C. tentaculata, P. bahamensis, and the tentacles of E. crassicornis deterred fish feeding. For C. tentaculata, bioassay-guided fractionation demonstrated that a mixture of 3 closely related alkylpyrrole sulfamates deterred fish at naturally occurring concentrations (2-n-hexylpyrrole sulfamate (1.6% of worm dry mass), 2-n-heptylpyrrole sulfamate (3.1% dry mass), and 2-n-octylpyrrole sulfamate (0.8% dry mass)). This appears to be the first documentation of characterized natural products defending a marine worm from consumers. For P. bahamensis and the tentacles of E. crassicornis, deterrent effects of crude extracts decomposed before specific compounds could be identified.",2003,Marine Ecology Progress Series
Comparison of high-dimensional confounder summary scores in comparative studies of newly marketed medications.,"OBJECTIVE
To compare confounding adjustment by high-dimensional propensity scores (hdPSs) and historically developed high-dimensional disease risk scores (hdDRSs) in three comparative study examples of newly marketed medications: (1) dabigatran vs. warfarin on major hemorrhage; (2) on death; and (3) cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors vs. nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on gastrointestinal bleeds.


STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING
In each example, we constructed a concurrent cohort of new and old drug initiators using US claims databases. In historical cohorts of old drug initiators, we developed hdDRS models including investigator-specified plus empirically identified variables and using principal component analysis and lasso regression for dimension reduction. We applied the models to the concurrent cohorts to obtain predicted outcome probabilities, which we used for confounding adjustment. We compared the resulting estimates to those from hdPS.


RESULTS
The crude odds ratio (OR) comparing dabigatran to warfarin was 0.52 (95% confidence interval: 0.37-0.72) for hemorrhage and 0.38 (0.26-0.55) for death. Decile stratification yielded an OR of 0.64 (0.46-0.90) for hemorrhage using hdDRS vs. 0.70 (0.49-1.02) for hdPS. ORs for death were 0.69 (0.45-1.06) and 0.73 (0.48-1.10), respectively. The relative performance of hdDRS in the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors example was similar.


CONCLUSION
hdDRS achieved similar or better confounding adjustment compared to conventional regression approach but worked slightly less well than hdPS.",2016,Journal of clinical epidemiology
"Drawing Valid Targeted Inference When Covariate-adjusted Response-adaptive RCT Meets Data-adaptive Loss-based Estimation, With An Application To The LASSO","Adaptive clinical trial design methods have garnered growing attention in the recent years, in large part due to their greater flexibility over their traditional counterparts. One such design is the so-called covariate-adjusted, response-adaptive (CARA) randomized controlled trial (RCT). In a CARA RCT, the treatment randomization schemes are allowed to depend on the patient's pre-treatment covariates, and the investigators have the opportunity to adjust these schemes during the course of the trial based on accruing information (including previous responses), in order to meet a pre-specified optimality criterion, while preserving the validity of the trial in learning its primary study parameter. In this article, we propose a new group-sequential CARA RCT design and corresponding analytical procedure that admits the use of flexible data-adaptive techniques. The proposed design framework can target general adaption optimality criteria that may not have a closed-form solution, thanks to a loss-based approach in defining and estimating the unknown optimal randomization scheme. Both in predicting the conditional response and in constructing the treatment randomization schemes, this framework uses loss-based data-adaptive estimation over general classes of functions (which may change with sample size). Since the randomization adaptation is response-adaptive, this innovative flexibility potentially translates into more effective adaptation towards the optimality criterion. To target the primary study parameter, the proposed analytical method provides robust inference of the parameter, despite arbitrarily mis-specified response models, under the most general settings. Specifically, we establish that, under appropriate entropy conditions on the classes of functions, the resulting sequence of randomization schemes converges to a fixed scheme, and the proposed treatment effect estimator is consistent (even under a mis-specified response model), asymptotically Gaussian, and gives rise to valid confidence intervals of given asymptotic levels. Moreover, the limiting randomization scheme coincides with the unknown optimal randomization scheme when, simultaneously, the response model is correctly specified and the optimal scheme belongs to the limit of the user-supplied classes of randomization schemes. We illustrate the applicability of these general theoretical results with a LASSO-based CARA RCT. In this example, both the response model and the optimal treatment randomization are estimated using a sequence of LASSO logistic models that may increase with sample size. It follows immediately from our general theorems that this LASSO-based CARA RCT converges to a fixed design and yields consistent and asymptotically Gaussian effect estimates, under minimal conditions on the smoothness of the basis functions in the LASSO logistic models. We exemplify the proposed methods with a simulation study.",2015,
Chapter 9 â€“ Basic OWL,"Publisher Summary 
This chapter focuses on modeling capabilities of OWL (Web Ontology Language). OWL provides constructs for describing information structure that will satisfy many of the outstanding requirements of FOAF (Friend of a Friend) and SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System), as well as a number of more general information integration issues. A key functionality of OWL is the ability to define restriction classes. The unnamed classes are defined based on restrictions on the values for particular properties of the class. Using this mechanism, OWL can be used to model situations in which the members of a particular class must have certain properties. In RDFS, the domain and range restrictions can allow us to make inferences about all the members of a class (such as playsFor relating a baseball player to a team). In OWL, one can use restriction statements to differentiate the case between something that applies to all members of a class versus some members, and even to insist on a particular value for a specific property of all members of a class. When restrictions are used in combination with the constructs of RDFS (Resource Description Framework Schema Language) especially rdfs:subPropertyOf and rdfs:subClassOf, and when they are cascaded with one another (restrictions referring to other restrictions), they can be used to model complex relationships between properties, classes, and individuals. The advantage of modeling relationships in this way (over informal specification) is that interactions of multiple specifications can be understood and even processed automatically.",2008,
When Personalization Meets Conformity: Collective Similarity based Multi-Domain Recommendation,"Existing recommender systems place emphasis on personalization to achieve promising accuracy. However, in the context of multiple domain, users are likely to seek the same behaviors as domain authorities. This conformity effect provides a wealth of prior knowledge when it comes to multi-domain recommendation, but has not been fully exploited. In particular, users whose behaviors are significant similar with the public tastes can be viewed as domain authorities. To detect these users meanwhile embed conformity into recommendation, a domain-specific similarity matrix is intuitively employed. Therefore, a collective similarity is obtained to leverage the conformity with personalization. In this paper, we establish a Collective Structure Sparse Representation(CSSR) method for multi-domain recommendation. Based on adaptive $k$-Nearest-Neighbor framework, we impose the lasso and group lasso penalties as well as least square loss to jointly optimize the collective similarity.

Identification and Treatment of Vasovagal Depression during Segmental Electrical Isolation of Pulmonary Veins,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features of reflex bradycardia and hypotension response during segmental electrical isolation of pulmonary veins(PVI)in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation(AF)patients and how to identify and treat it.Methods:We studied 90 patients with paroxysmal AF(66 men,38ï½ž72 years)who had undergone a successful PVI guided by Lasso mapping catheter.We routinely performed segmental PVI using thermo-control or irrigated RF catheter.The psymptom,saturation of blood oxygen and cuff blood pressure was monitored closely during the procedure.Re- suits:8 patients(9%)developed vasovagal depression during the procedure.7 of 8 patients developed bradycardia-hypotension syndrome,3 of 7 patients were induced by intolerant chest pain during RF application.1 patient had transientâ… degree AV block.These patients made quick recovery by being treated with intravenous administration of atropine and dopamine.5 of 8 patients developed vasovagal depression during left super pulmonary vein isolation.3 of 90 patients developed cardiac tampon- ade.Urgent pericardial drainage was taken in 2 patients.1 of 2 patients had surgery.1 patient was treated with expectant treatment.Follow up(mean 29+/-10 months)was complete and no patient died.Conelusion:Vasovagal depression has a varie- ty of clinical features during RF catheter ablation of the pulmonary vein tissues.It can be confused with cardiac tamponade easi- ly,suggesting that it might be very important to identify accurately and treat immediately.",2007,Chinese journal of Clinical Medicine
Stability selection using a genetic algorithm and logistic linear regression on healthcare records,"This paper presents a Genetic Algorithm (GA) application to measuring feature importance in machine learning (ML) from a large-scale database. Too many input features may cause over-fitting, therefore a feature selection is desirable. Some ML algorithms have feature selection embedded, e.g., lasso penalized linear regression or random forests. Others do not include such functionality and are sensitive to over-fitting, e.g., unregularized linear regression. The latter algorithms require that proper features are chosen before learning.
 Therefore, we propose a novel stability selection (SS) approach using GA-based feature selection. The proposed SS approach iteratively applies GA on a subsample of records and features. Each GA individual represents a binary vector of selected features in the subsample. An unregularized logistic linear regression model is then trained and tested using GA-selected features through cross-validation of the subsamples. GA fitness is evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and optimized during a GA run.
 AUC is assessed with an unregularized logistic regression model on multiple-subsampled healthcare records, collected under the Healthcare Cost, and Utilization Project (HCUP), utilizing the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) database.
 Reported results show that averaging feature importance from top-4 SS and the SS using GA (GASS), improves these AUC results.",2017,Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion

Relational Lasso - An Improved Method Using the Relations Among Features -,"Relational lasso is a method that incorporates feature relations within machine learning. By using automatically obtained noisy relations among features, relational lasso learns an additional penalty parameter per feature, which is then incorporated in terms of a regularizer within the target optimization function. Relational lasso has been tested on three different tasks: text categorization, polarity estimation, and parsing, where it was compared with conventional lasso and adaptive lasso (Zou, 2006) when using a multi-class logistic regression optimization method. Relational lasso outperformed these other lasso methods in the tests.",2011,
CÃ¢ncer de prÃ³stata localizado,"Entre os tumores malignos que afetam o homem, o cÃ¢ncer de prostata e o tipo mais comum, representando um dos principais problemas de saude publica no Brasil. O Rio Grande do Sul e o estado da federacao com a maior taxa de incidencia estimada de cÃ¢ncer de prostata. O presente artigo objetiva proporcionar uma visao geral sobre epidemiologia, diagnostico, rastreamento, prevencao e tratamento do cÃ¢ncer de prostata localizado. Para isso foi realizada uma pesquisa no banco de dados MEDLINE (1996-2006) e analise dos consensos das principais entidades urologicas internacionais (American UrologicalAssociation/European Association of Urology), bem como das diretrizes de uro-oncologia da Sociedade Brasileira de Urologia (SBU).

O emprego das opcoes terapeuticas em pacientes com neoplasia localizada deve levar em consideracao a expectativa de vida do paciente e as complicacoes relacionadas ao tratamento Prostate cancer is the most common among the malignant tumors affecting males, and it represents one of the leading public health problems in Brazil. Rio Grande do Sul is the Brazilian state with the highest estimated incidence of prostate cancer. The present article provides an overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, screening, prevention and treatment of localized prostate cancer. For that, we conducted a survey of databank MEDLINE (1996-2006) and made an analysis of the consensuses of the main international urology entities (American Urological Association/European Association of Urology), as well as the uro-oncology guidelines of the Brazilian Society of Urology (SBU). The diagnosis of prostate cancer must be based on histopathological examination (prostate biopsy). Active treatment is used in most stages of prostate cancer. Post-therapeutic follow-up is based on directed anamnesis and on serum levels of specific prostatic antigen and digital transrectal examination. Currently, prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumors in males. The choice from among treatment options in patients with localized neoplasm must take into account patient's life expectancy and treatment-related complications",2010,
Multilinear Regression for Embedded Feature Selection with Application to fMRI Analysis,"Embedded feature selection is effective when both prediction 
and interpretation are needed. The Lasso and its extensions 
are standard methods for selecting a subset of features while 
optimizing a prediction function. In this paper, we are interested 
in embedded feature selection for multidimensional 
data, wherein (1) there is no need to reshape the multidimensional 
data into vectors and (2) structural information from 
multiple dimensions are taken into account. Our main contribution 
is a new method called Regularized multilinear regression 
and selection (Remurs) for automatically selecting a subset 
of features while optimizing prediction for multidimensional 
data. Both nuclear norm and the `1-norm are carefully 
incorporated to derive a multi-block optimization algorithm 
with proved convergence. In particular, Remurs is motivated 
by fMRI analysis where the data are multidimensional and it 
is important to find the connections of raw brain voxels with 
functional activities. Experiments on synthetic and real data 
show the advantages of Remurs compared to Lasso, Elastic 
Net, and their multilinear extensions.",2017,
Iconografia e culto di Nostra Signora Dâ€™Itria nella Sardegna Spagnola,"Il culto di Nostra Signora dâ€™Itria o Odigitria o di Costantinopoli, legato allâ€™icona della Vergine col Bambino venerata a Bisanzio e distrutta nel 1453, pervenne in Occidente in un ampio lasso di tempo, dalle lotte iconoclaste (sec. VIII) fino alla caduta dellâ€™Impero dâ€™Oriente (sec. XV). La Sardegna, insieme alla Puglia e alla Sicilia vanta un culto antico, attestato da documenti materiali a partire dalla meta del XVI secolo e che ha avuto una fioritura straordinaria nel corso del Seicento. Se i dipinti si riallacciano agli schemi iconografici diffusi nelle aree calabresi e siciliane che evocano la processione con lâ€™icona, i gruppi statuari con la Vergine, lo schiavo cristiano e il padrone turco o moro, sembrano ispirarsi a racconti di esclusiva origine locale, forse eventi storici poi mitizzati che hanno assunto un valore universale di salvazione dal pericolo barbaresco, fortemente sentito dalle popolazioni locali lungo tutto il periodo di dominazione spagnola. Nostra Signora dâ€™Itria or Odigitria or Constantinople faith, attached to the icon of Vergin Mary with child worshipped in Bysantium and distroyed in 1453, arrived at The West during a wide lapse of time, from the iconoclast fightings (VIII century) to the Eastern Empireâ€™s fall ( XV century). Sardinia, together with Apulia and Sicily is proud of an ancient faith, certified from materials documents, from the middle of XVI th century and that has had an extraordinary explosion during the six hundred century. If the paintings attach to the iconographic outlines spread to the Sicilian and Calabrian areas that bring to our memory the iconâ€™s procession, the statues groups with the Vergin and the Christian Slave and the Turkish or Mour owner, they seem to get inspiration from exclusive local stories, perhaps historical events then changed into miths that have taken on an universal worth of salvation from the barbaric danger, strongly felt from the local populations during the all Spanish domination.",2012,
Flexible Edge Arrangement Templates for Object Detection,"We present a novel feature representation for categorical object detection. Unlike previous approaches that have concentrated on generic interest-point detectors, we construct object-specific features directly from the training images. Our feature is represented by a collection of Flexible Edge Arrangement Templates (FEATs). We propose a two-stage semi-supervised learning approach to feature selection. A subset of frequent templates are first selected from a large template pool. In the second stage, we formulate feature selection as a regression problem and use LASSO method to find the most discriminative templates from the preselected ones. FEATs adaptively capture the image structure and naturally accommodate local shape variations. We show that this feature can be complemented by the traditional holistic patch method, thus achieving both efficiency and accuracy. We evaluate our method on three well-known car datasets, showing performance competitive with existing methods.",2008,2008 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision
Diversity and acyl-homoserine lactone production among subtidal biofilm-forming bacteria,"Bacteria isolated from subtidal biofilms were identified via 16S rRNA gene sequencing and screened for acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) production. In total, 68 strains were isolated from 1 to 9 d-old subtidal biofilms developed at a coastal fish farm. Identification based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that these isolates were distributed among 3 phylogenetic groups (4 Bac- teroidetes, 13 Î±-Proteobacteria and 51 Î³-Proteobacteria), with most isolates belonging to the family Rhodobacteraceae and the genera Thalassomonas, Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Shewanella and Vibrio. AHL screening was performed using 2 AHL reporter strains, Agrobacterium tumefaciens A136 and Chromobacterium violaceum CV026. Results showed that 21 strains (31%) produced AHLs, including 3 Bacteroidetes, 5 Î±-Proteobacteria and 13 Î³-Proteobacteria. All the AHL-producing Î±-Proteobacteria belonged to the family Rhodobacteraceae, whereas the AHL-producing Î³-Pro- teobacteria consisted of 6 Pseudoalteromonas spp., 6 Vibrio spp. and 1 Thalassomonas sp. This is the first report of AHL-producing marine bacteria in the genera Flammeovirga, Pseudoalteromonas and Thalassomonas. The family Rhodobacteraceae (11 isolates) and the genera Vibrio (15 isolates) and Pseudoalteromonas (17 isolates) had the greatest number of AHL-producing isolates. AHL profiling of the AHL-producing isolates was performed by GC-MS. Most AHL-producing isolates produced several different AHLs, many of which were long-chain- and 3-oxo-AHLs. The widespread occur- rence of AHL-producing bacteria in subtidal biofilms suggests that AHLs may play a role in the com- munity development in this environment.",2008,Aquatic Microbial Ecology
Formal asymptotic analysis of elastic beams and thin-walled beams: A derivation of the Vlassov equations and their generalization to the anisotropic heterogeneous case,"The modelling of ordinary beams and thin-walled beams is rigorously obtained from a formal asymptotic analysis of three-dimensional linear elasticity. In the case of isotropic homogeneous elasticity, ordinary beams yield the Navier-Bernoulli beam model, thin-walled beams with open profile yield the Vlassov beam model and thin-walled beams with closed profile the Navier-Bernoulli beam model. The formal asymptotic analysis is also extensively performed in the case of the most general anisotropic transversely heterogeneous material (meaning the heterogeneity is the same in every cross-section), delivering the same qualitative results. We prove, in particular, the non-intuitive fact that the warping function appearing in the Vlassov model for general anisotropic transversely heterogeneous material, is the same as the one appearing in the isotropic homogeneous case. In the general case of anisotropic transversely heterogeneous material, the analysis provides a rigorous and systematic constructive procedure for calculating the reduced elastic moduli, both in Navier-Bernoulli and Vlassov theories.",2019,
Attitudes toward Psychology Relative to Other Disciplines,"In a rapidly changing health care marketplace, professional psychologists are increasingly concernedabout the public's attitude toward psychology. In two samples, one of the general population andone of college faculty, both psychology and sociology were rated as having made less importantcontributions to society and as having less expertise than biology, chemistry, medicine, and physics.The implications of these findings are considered in relation to the recent American PsychologicalAssociation public education campaign and the field's century-long concern about the public percep-tion of psychology.That psychology is not always perceived favorably by thepublic is not a new issue. Benjamin (1986) pointed out thatpsychology's public image has been of concern since the firstorganizational meeting of the American Psychological Associa-tion (APA) in 1892, and this concern continues today. Indeed,a number of surveys and observers have suggested that the publicdoes not have a clear idea of what it is psychologists do and thatthe public does not view the discipline of psychology favorably(Atkinson, 1977; Furnham, 1983; Thumin & Zebelman, 1967).Of particular interest is the finding of Raviv and Weiner (1995),who documented the strong negative reactions of Israelis towardthe involvement of psychologists in the public media during thePersian Gulf War.Most of the authors just mentioned concluded with a call forgreater efforts to educate the public about the nature of thediscipline of psychology and how it can affect their lives. Soci-ety's view of our discipline may have profound implications forthe future of psychology. There may currently be a general dis-trust in the findings of psychological research (Wood, Jones, B Benjamin, 1986). Perhaps of evenLouis H.

Shrinkage estimation and selection for a logistic regression model,"This paper considers the problem of variable selection and the esti- mation for a logistic regression model via shrinkage and three penalty methods. We develop a large sample theory for the shrinkage estimators including as- ymptotic distributional bias and risk. We show that if the shrinkage dimension exceeds two, the asymptotic risk of the shrinkage estimator is strictly less than the classical estimators for a wide class of models. This reduction holds glob- ally in the parameter space. Furthermore, we consider three different penalty estimators: the LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and SCAD and compare their rel- ative performance with the shrinkage estimators numerically. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted for different combinations of inactive predictors and the performance of each method is evaluated in terms of a simulated mean squared error. This study indicates that shrinkage method is comparable to the LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and SCAD when the number of inactive pre- dictors in the model is relatively large. A real data example is presented to illustrate the proposed methodologies.",2014,
Direct and label-free gram classification of bacterial colonies on agar using hyperspectral imaging,"Diffuse reflectance spectra of bacterial colonies, from hyperspectral images, allowed for a label-free Gram classification into Gram-positive (GP) and Gram-negative (GN) types. Thirty-eight strains belonging to 14 bacterial species typically encountered in urinary tract infections (UTI) were cultivated on chromID CPS Elite translucent chromogenic culture medium to build training and testing sets. Using Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised learning models, we demonstrated excellent classification rates with a percentage of correctly classified samples as high as 95%. Because determination of discriminant spectral channels is critical both for fundamental reasons to help understand the origin of the discriminant signal and for practical reasons to envision simpler multispectral systems, parsimonious analysis was conducted employing a Fused LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) or based on an uncertainty test in Partial least squares PLS regression analysis. Two prominent distinct spectral regions were thus identified allowing to hypothesize that cytochrome ratios might be, at least in part, at the origin of the differences observed between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria populations.",2018,
Not All Girls like to Write: The Writing Self-Perception of One Girl Writer,"Abstract""I try a lot, but sometimes, I just don't like it,"" explains Beth, a sixth grade girl writer. While considerable effort has been placed on engaging reluctant boys as writers, Beth's story reveals that girls can also be reluctant to write. This case study explores the attitudes and writing self-perception of one girl writer. Self-perception and attribution not only aids in explaining the motivation and engagement to write, but also aids in explaining the internalization of failure and extemalization of successes as displayed by girls. In supporting Beth as a writer, the importance of purpose and time are the keys to engaging and motivating reluctant writers.Not all girls like to writeGiven the Boy Crisis, many educators and researchers alike would argue that engaging and motivating boys as writers is paramount (Allen, 2006; Connell, 1996; Dutro, Kazemi, & Balf, 2006; Fisher & Frey, 2012; Fletcher, 2006; Lassonde, 2006; Martino & Meyenn, 2002; Newkirk, 2002; Serafini, 2013; Smith & Wilhelm, 2002; Smith & Wilhelm, 2004; Smith & Wilhelm, 2006; Voss, 2003). While motivating boys is important, this assumption has led to stereotypes that girls are good writers and therefore do not need attention (AAUW, 1992). Although there are girls who fit this stereotype and do enjoy writing, there are still many others who do not fit this mold (Chai, 2010). This is the story of one sixth grade girl, Beth (pseudonym used, as is all names within this article), and her self-perception and attitude towards writing. ""Cases seldom exist alone. If there is one, there surely are more somewhere"" asserts Stake (1995, p. 72). Beth's story is not unique and she represents countless other girls who do not view themselves as good writers. This is the story of one reluctant girl writer.""I wasn't good enough"": Viewing writing self-perception within Attribution theoryWriting self-perceptions are the beliefs that students have regarding their abilities as writers. These beliefs give insight into the motivation and engagement that writers hold (Pajares, 2003). Students who have positive writing self-perception view themselves as writers and are more likely and willing to put forth effort in writing tasks, even those they may not necessarily like. Similarly, students with low writing self-perception are more likely to not view themselves as writers, thus are more apt to disengage or put forth minimal effort. The effort that a student puts forth impacts not only the quality of writing, but also their satisfaction in having produced a piece of work they believe to be good (Cleary, 1996; Pajares & Vahante, 2006).Meece and Painter (2008) found that within academic contexts, girls tended to be stronger writers than boys. Despite the common assumptions that girls are good at writing, motivated, and conscientious about their own learning, there are many adolescent girls who are reluctant and even resistant writers (Oalfson, 2006). Reluctant girl writers do not fit the expected norm of being good writers and therefore are often overlooked. More than just a physiological difference, girls attribute their writing abilities or inabilities differently than boys. One way to examine students' motivation is by viewing their writing engagement through the lens of attribution theory. Attribution theory aids in explaining the origin of a student's desire (i.e. volition) to write by examining the attributes that make up motivation (Anderman & Anderman, 2010). Attribution theory consists of three components: stability, locus of control, and controllability (Weiner, Nierenberg, & Goldstein, 1976). Stability helps to explain students' ability and response to task-difficulty changes over time; as students grow in their understanding of the writing process, their writing ability and skills improve. The second component, locus of control, examines the internal and external factors that influence motivation (Weiner, 2000). â€¦",2014,The Ohio Reading Teacher
Tree-Guided Sparse Coding for Brain Disease Classification,"Neuroimage analysis based on machine learning technologies has been widely employed to assist the diagnosis of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stage--mild cognitive impairment. One of the major problems in brain image analysis involves learning the most relevant features from a huge set of raw imaging features, which are far more numerous than the training samples. This makes the tasks of both disease classification and interpretation extremely challenging. Sparse coding via L1 regularization, such as Lasso, can provide an effective way to select the most relevant features for alleviating the curse of dimensionality and achieving more accurate classification. However, the selected features may distribute randomly throughout the whole brain, although in reality disease-induced abnormal changes often happen in a few contiguous regions. To address this issue, we investigate a tree-guided sparse coding method to identify grouped imaging features in the brain regions for guiding disease classification and interpretation. Spatial relationships of the image structures are imposed during sparse coding with a tree-guided regularization. Our experimental results on the ADNI dataset show that the tree-guided sparse coding method not only achieves better classification accuracy, but also allows for more meaningful diagnosis of brain diseases compared with the conventional L1-regularized LASSO.",2012,Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Genetic structure and biogeography of three wrasse species (Labridae) within the Western Indian Ocean,"The biogeography of wrasses within the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) is poorly understood, with regard to origins and genetic differentiation or connectivity among the regions of the WIO. This region is a good model for studying the influence of physical complexities and biogeographic breaks in shaping patterns of differentiation in wrasses. Three reef-associated fish species, Cheilio inermis, Thalassoma hebraicum and T. lunare, were selected to examine the factors that have influenced patterns of differentiation across the WIO. Each species was sampled from various localities of the WIO, the Red Sea and Indo-West Pacific Islands. Sequence data were generated from two mitochondrial gene fragments (cytochrome b and ATPase 6) and one nuclear locus (the first intron of the ribosomal protein S7 gene). Genetic analyses were used to calculate genetic diversity indices within species, which were then compared among species. The relationships among haplotypes and alleles were constructed using median-joining networks. Where necessary, neighbour-joining trees (NJ) were constructed to examine relationships among haplotypes and alleles for the Thalassoma species. Population structure was analysed using AMOVA and pairwise Ð¤ST to compare and calculate differentiation between the WIO localities. Mismatch distributions were used to examine population growth and decline or stability, and demographic parameters were used to calculate time of population expansion. There was high haplotype (h = 0.88 to 0.98) and low nucleotide diversities (Ï€ = 0.003 to 0.008) among all species for mitochondrial markers. For S7 intron I, high allelic (A = 0.95 to 0.98) and low nucleotide diversities (Ï€ = 0.002 to 0.014) were observed for all species. The pairwise Ð¤ST values revealed little to great (Ð¤ST = -0.02 to 0.67) genetic differentiation between localities, across all species for the three gene regions. The pairwise comparisons indicated the differentiation in C. inermis of Tanzania and Kenya from Mozambique and Nosy Be (Madagascar). The widespread C. inermis also revealed the differentiation of Kenya and Tanzania. For C. inermis, the AMOVAs of ATPase 6 and cytochrome b data indicated high differentiation among defined locality groups. The groups were defined according to geographic proximity. However, the AMOVA of the nuclear gene (S7 intron I) did not find variation among defined locality groups. Cheilio inermis revealed a sequence divergence of 0.4%. The divergence that was found in C. inermis was not enough to suggest a cryptic species within the WIO. Overall, the widespread and monotypic C. inermis revealed genetic differentiation within the WIO. Thalassoma hebraicum generally revealed little genetic iii differentiation across the WIO. The AMOVAs of the three gene regions showed no variation among specimens of the defined locality groups. However, some differentiation was found between localities. The pairwise comparisons of T. hebraicum revealed the differentiation of Seychelles from the African mainland and Madagascar. Southern Africa was observed to be differentiated from Nosy Be and Zanzibar. The observed differentiation could be caused by oceanic barriers such as the South Equatorial Current (SEQC), East African Coastal Current (EACC), and the Comoros Gyres and eddies in the Mozambique Channel, and Agulhas Current. Thalassoma lunare revealed genetic isolation between the WIO and the Red Sea as well as within the WIO. The genetic isolation between the WIO and the Red Sea is probably due to the historical isolation by the Bab al Mandab and contemporary barriers such as the cold upwelling cells in Somalia. The differentiation of Maldives from the African mainland and Seychelles could be due to distance and the upwelling cells created by monsoon winds. Mismatch distributions suggested that C. inermis and T. hebraicum had undergone demographic expansion during the Pleistocene (92 678 to 40 219 years ago). The results of the current study are similar to those from previous studies of WIO reef fish species, and the results of the present study could have potential implications for conservation and fisheries management. Single genetic markers and single species studies do not detect all barriers to dispersal in the WIO, thus they are insufficient to inform conservation management. Thus, the use of multispecies and genetic markers in the current study can be adopted by other studies of the marine taxa of the WIO.",2016,
Proving Termination of Tree Manipulating Programs,"We consider the termination problem of programs manipulating treelike dynamic data structures. Our approach is based on a counter-example guided abstraction refinement loop. We use abstract regular tree model-checking to infer invariants of the program. Then, we translate the program to a counter automaton (CA) which simulates it. If the CA can be shown to terminate using existing techniques, the program terminates. If not, we analyse the possible counterexample given by a CA termination checker and either conclude that the program does not terminate, or else refine the abstraction and repeat. We show that the spuriousness problem for lasso-shaped counterexamples is decidable in some non-trivial cases. We applied the method successfully on several interesting case studies.",2007,

Situation-Based Interaction Learning for Personality Prediction on Facebook,"Predicting individuals personality traits with their social media profile has proved to be feasible, but researchers recently have run into bottlenecks on further improving the prediction accuracy. One major limitation is that existing studies failed to consider context information in predicting social media usersâ€™ behaviors. In this paper, we adopted the DIAMONDS situation theory in psychology to capture the context information in Facebook posts. To solve this issue, we proposed a novel situation-based feature interaction learning model. In this study, we extracted situation features according to the DIAMONDS lexicon and computed the interaction values between these situation features and the commonly used n-gram features at the post level. Features at the post level were aggregated up to the user level using the averaging strategy. A group lasso penalty was employed to enforce strong heredity in the model, which addressed the overfitting challenge introduced by the interaction features. Empirical tests on large-scale data set have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2018,
Parallel Lasso for Large-Scale Video Concept Detection,"Existing video concept detectors are generally built upon the kernel based machine learning techniques, e.g., support vector machines, regularized least squares, and logistic regression, just to name a few. However, in order to build robust detectors, the learning process suffers from the scalability issues including the high-dimensional multi-modality visual features and the large-scale keyframe examples. In this paper, we propose parallel lasso (Plasso) by introducing the parallel distributed computation to significantly improve the scalability of lasso (the <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> regularized least squares). We apply the parallel incomplete Cholesky factorization to approximate the covariance statistics in the preprocess step, and the parallel primal-dual interior-point method with the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula to optimize the model parameters. For a dataset with <i>n</i> samples in a <i>d</i>-dimensional space, compared with lasso, Plasso significantly reduces complexities from the original <i>O</i>(<i>d</i><sup>3</sup>) for computational time and <i>O</i>(<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>) for storage space to <i>O</i>(<i>h</i><sup>2</sup><i>d</i>/<i>m</i>) and <i>O</i>(<i>hd</i>/<i>m</i>) , respectively, if the system has <i>m</i> processors and the reduced dimension <i>h</i> is much smaller than the original dimension <i>d</i> . Furthermore, we develop the kernel extension of the proposed linear algorithm with the sample reweighting schema, and we can achieve similar time and space complexity improvements [time complexity from <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>) to <i>O</i>(<i>h</i><sup>2</sup><i>n</i>/<i>m</i>) and the space complexity from <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) to <i>O</i>(<i>hn</i>/<i>m</i>), for a dataset with <i>n</i> training examples]. Experimental results on TRECVID video concept detection challenges suggest that the proposed method can obtain significant time and space savings for training effective detectors with limited communication overhead.",2012,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia
Analysis of bacterial community structure in toluene degradation by a halophilic consortium,"A halophilic bacterial consortium that could degrade BTEX(benzene,tolunene,ethybenzene,xylene) at the salinity of 5% was enriched from oil-contaminated saline soil.Bacterial community structure dynamics in toluene degradation by the consortium was analyzed.The consortium could degrade 200 mg/L toluene at the salinity of 5%.PCR-DGGE profiles revealed that with toluene addition,the predominant species shifted from Bacillus sp.and Bacillus aquimaris to Thalassospira xiamenensis,Pseudomonas stutzeri,Virgibacillus sp.as well as Bacillus sp.,four of which remained stable during the degradation process and the following 24h when toluene was depleted.In addition,the consortium could degrade phenanthrene,illustrating its versatility in utilizing aromatic hydrocarbons.",2010,China Environmental Science
A Scalable and Extensible Framework for Superposition-Structured Models,"In many learning tasks, structural models usually lead to better interpretability and higher generalization performance. In recent years, however, the simple structural models such as lasso are frequently proved to be insufficient. Accordingly, there has been a lot of work on ""superposition-structured"" models where multiple structural constraints are imposed. To efficiently solve these ""superposition-structured"" statistical models, we develop a framework based on a proximal Newton-type method. Employing the smoothed conic dual approach with the LBFGS updating formula, we propose a scalable and extensible proximal quasi-Newton (SEP-QN) framework. Empirical analysis on various datasets shows that our framework is potentially powerful, and achieves super-linear convergence rate for optimizing some popular ""superposition-structured"" statistical models such as the fused sparse group lasso.",2016,
Estimating signals over graphs via multi-kernel learning,"Estimating functions on graphs finds well-documented applications in machine learning and, more recently, in signal processing. Given signal values on a subset of vertices, the goal is to estimate the signal on the remaining ones. This task amounts to estimating a function (or signal) over a graph. Most existing techniques either rely on parametric signal models or require costly cross-validation. Leveraging the framework of multi-kernel learning, a data-driven nonparametric approach is developed here. Instead of a single kernel, the algorithm relies on a dictionary of candidate kernels and efficiently selects the most suitable ones by minimizing a convex criterion using a group Lasso module. Numerical tests demonstrate the superior estimation performance of the novel approach over competing alternatives.",2016,2016 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)
Reprioritizing Genetic Associations in Hit Regions Using LASSO-Based Resample Model Averaging,"Significance testing one SNP at a time has proven useful for identifying genomic regions that harbor variants affecting human disease. But after an initial genome scan has identified a ""hit region"" of association, single-locus approaches can falter. Local linkage disequilibrium (LD) can make both the number of underlying true signals and their identities ambiguous. Simultaneous modeling of multiple loci should help. However, it is typically applied ad hoc: conditioning on the top SNPs, with limited exploration of the model space and no assessment of how sensitive model choice was to sampling variability. Formal alternatives exist but are seldom used. Bayesian variable selection is coherent but requires specifying a full joint model, including priors on parameters and the model space. Penalized regression methods (e.g., LASSO) appear promising but require calibration, and, once calibrated, lead to a choice of SNPs that can be misleadingly decisive. We present a general method for characterizing uncertainty in model choice that is tailored to reprioritizing SNPs within a hit region under strong LD. Our method, LASSO local automatic regularization resample model averaging (LLARRMA), combines LASSO shrinkage with resample model averaging and multiple imputation, estimating for each SNP the probability that it would be included in a multi-SNP model in alternative realizations of the data. We apply LLARRMA to simulations based on case-control genome-wide association studies data, and find that when there are several causal loci and strong LD, LLARRMA identifies a set of candidates that is enriched for true signals relative to single locus analysis and to the recently proposed method of Stability Selection.",2012,Genetic Epidemiology
Gilles Deleuze and Michel Henry: Critical Contrasts in the Deduction of Life as Transcendental,"To address the theological turn in phenomenology, this paper sets out critical arguments opposing the theist phenomenology of Michel Henry and Gilles Deleuzeâ€™s philosophy of the event. Henryâ€™s phenomenology has been overlooked in recent commentaries compared with, for example, Jean-Luc Marionâ€™s work. It will be shown here that Henryâ€™s philosophy presents a detailed novel turn in phenomenology structured according to critical moves against positions developed from Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty. This demonstration is done through a strong contrast with Deleuze and a short engagement with Quentin Meillassoux. The paper presents an argument against the theological turn on the grounds that it misunderstands the form of affectivity when compared to Deleuzeâ€™s work on affect and event. It will be argued that Henryâ€™s search for a free-standing affect deduced as a condition for any appearance underplays the way any affect is included in many causal and transcendentally determined series such that any notion of the pure affect independent of other processes is a fiction. The loss of this pure affect entails the questioning of the theological turn in Henry.",2008,Sophia
Immune cell infiltration as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of digestive system cancer,"The digestive system cancers are aggressive cancers with the highest mortality worldwide. In this study, we performed a systematic investigation of the tumor immune microenvironment to identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The fraction of 22 immune cell types of patients were estimated using CIBERSORT. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis was performed to identify important immune predictors. By comparing immune cell compositions in 801 tumor samples and 46 normal samples, we constructed diagnostic-immune-score (DIS), showing high specificity and sensitivity in the training (AUC =0.929), validation (AUC=0.935) and different cancer type cohorts (AUC >0.70 for all). We also established the prognostic-immune-score (PIS), which was an effective prognostic factor for relapse-free survival in training, validation and entire cohorts (p<0.05). Besides, PIS provided a higher net benefit than TNM stage. A composite nomogram was built based on PIS and patients' clinical information with well-fitted calibration curves (c-index=0.84). We further used other cohorts from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to obtain the similar results, confirming the reliability and validity of the DIS and PIS. In addition, the unsupervised clustering analysis using immune cell proportions revealed six immune subtypes, suggesting that the immune types defined relative high levels of M0 or/and M1 macrophages were the high-risk subtypes of relapse. In conclusion, this study comprehensively analyzed the tumor immune microenvironment and identified DIS and PIS for digestive system cancers.",2019,Cancer Science
Estimation and selection of complex covariate effects in pooled nested case-control studies with heterogeneity.,"A major challenge in cancer epidemiologic studies, especially those of rare cancers, is observing enough cases. To address this, researchers often join forces by bringing multiple studies together to achieve large sample sizes, allowing for increased power in hypothesis testing, and improved efficiency in effect estimation. Combining studies, however, renders the analysis difficult owing to the presence of heterogeneity in the pooled data. In this article, motivated by a collaborative nested case-control (NCC) study of ovarian cancer in three cohorts from United States, Sweden, and Italy, we investigate the use of penalty regularized partial likelihood estimation in the context of pooled NCC studies to achieve two goals. First, we propose an adaptive group lasso (gLASSO) penalized approach to simultaneously identify important variables and estimate their effects. Second, we propose a composite agLASSO penalized approach to identify variables with heterogeneous effects. Both methods are readily implemented with the group coordinate gradient decent algorithm and shown to enjoy the oracle property. We conduct simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our proposed approaches in finite samples under various heterogeneity settings, and apply them to the pooled ovarian cancer study.",2013,Biostatistics
Strange Countries and Secret Worlds in Ruth Rendell's Crime Novels*,"At the beginning of the twentieth century, commentators viewed crime fiction at best as an escapist diversion and at worst as a threat to morality that rivaled public drinking houses (Brunsdale 1990). Since then the genre, with an avid following in the tens of millions worldwide, has gained respectability. Recent estimates suggest that mystery novels account for at least 20 percent of all books sold (Klein 1994), yet in spite of - or perhaps because of - their popularity, mysteries attract only modest academic attention. Contributions from studies in literature and history outnumber those from the social sciences. Nearly twenty years ago Gary Elbow and Tom Martinson singled out mysteries, along with westerns and science fiction, as categories of writing that had been overlooked by geographers (1980). This situation has begun to change, for several reasons. First, as the ""new"" cultural geography has gained greater acceptance, the study of works of fiction has become more widespread (Jackson 1989; Daniels 1992; Price and Lewis 1993). Leading scholars have contributed papers on the literary geography of detective fiction (Tuan 1985), and classical mystery writers like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Dame Agatha Christie, and Dorothy L. Sayers have been analyzed by human and physical geographers (McManis 1978; Cerveny and Brazel 1989). More recent novels have also been explored (Monaghan 1987; Hamilton 1991; Hausladen 1995). Second, a growing number of educators are adopting problem-based approaches to learning. The use of different facets of geography in solving hypothetical mysteries can be as informative as it is enjoyable (Felton and Allen 1987; Komoto and Gersmehl 1991, Hodder 1994). This counteracts public perception of geography as mere rote memorization and demonstrates the usefulness of geographical approaches in real-world situations. Third, in recent years women's experiences and perspectives have attracted the attention of many scholars. From the beginning, female writers have played a key role in the development of the mystery genre (Bargainnier 1981; Brunsdale 1990; Klein 1994). The Golden Age of the detective story - the 1920s - was also the time when women fought for legal status as persons, won the right to vote, and began to change the unwritten social code that dictated how a ""lady"" should behave. Many of the female mystery writers of that time, who were young, intelligent, well educated, and ambitious, championed feminist causes. Contemporary literary works, especially mysteries viewed as historical documents, are thus a valuable record of social change. Crime novelists, both British and American, continue to write about obstacles and challenges faced by today's women (James 1972; Carlson 1993). In addition, mysteries can themselves influence geography through the tourism and entertainment industries. Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories have attracted a cult following worldwide: Special tours and guidebooks cater to fans, and theme restaurants and pubs have sprung up around Baker Street in London (Kobayashi, Higashiyama, and Uemura 1986). The English city of Oxford, already a popular tourist destination, has gained additional fame as the setting for mystery novels like Dorothy L. Sayers's Gaudy Night (Hitchman 1975) and Colin Dexter's Chief Inspector Morse series (Dale and Hendershott 1988; Glasson 1994). Similar situations occur elsewhere in the world; Joan Laxson, for example, cites the influence of Tony Hillerman's novels on tourism in the southwestern United States (1991). REPRESENTATIONS OF GEOGRAPHY BY MYSTERY WRITERS His knowledge of geography was minimal. At his junior school, his teachers had given him a few assorted facts about the exports of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and the rest; and at the age of eight he had known - and still knew (with the exception of South Dakota) - all the capital cities of the American States. But that was the end of his apprenticeship in that discipline. â€¦",1998,Geographical Review
Survival-Associated Alternative Messenger RNA Splicing Signatures in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: A Study Based on RNA-Sequencing Data.,"Multiple studies have shown that cancer-specific alternative splicing (AS) alterations are associated with clinical outcome. In this study, we aimed to profile prognostic AS signatures for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We integrated the percent-spliced-in (PSI) data of AS in 140 PDAC patients based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We identified overall survival (OS)-associated AS events using univariate Cox regression analysis. Then, prognostic AS signatures were constructed for OS and chemoresistance prediction using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. We also analyzed splicing factors (SFs) regulatory networks by Pearson's correlation. We detected 677 OS-related AS events in 485 genes by profiling 10,354 AS events obtained from 140 PDAC patients. Gene functional enrichment analysis demonstrated the pathways enriched by survival-associated AS. The AS signatures constructed with significant survival-associated AS events revealed high performance in predicting PDAC survival and gemcitabine chemoresistance. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.937 in training cohort and 0.748 in validation cohort at 2000 days of OS. Furthermore, we identified prognostic SFs (e.g., ESRP1 and HNRNPC) to build the AS regulatory network. We constructed AS signatures for OS and gemcitabine chemoresistance in PDAC patients, which may provide clues for further experiment-based mechanism study.",2019,DNA and cell biology
"Seagrass foliage from the Maastrichtian type area (Maastrichtian, Danian, NE Belgium, SE Netherlands)","Abstract Seagrasses are the only angiosperms that have invaded the marine environment. Fossil seagrasses are rare and received only little attention to date. However, among the scarce plant fossils in the marine deposits of the Maastrichtian type area, remains of seagrasses are relatively common. The present paper provides a detailed description of the morphology and anatomy of the leaves. Maastrichtian and Danian material is considered here as a single species: Thalassotaenia debeyi gen. nov., sp. nov. Campanian material is assigned to Zosterites , but this is not necessarily a seagrass. Thalassotaenia includes the oldest anatomically preserved material of seagrass leaves. Comparison with extant seagrasses shows that there is not an easy match with any of the extant genera or families. Amphibolis and Thalassodendron (Cymodoceaceae) and Posidonia (Posidoniaceae) show the greatest resemblance. Possibly, Thalassotaenia represents the leaves of an ancestor of the Cymodoceaceaeâ€“Posidoniaceae (â€“Ruppiaceae) clade found in several phylogenetic analyses. Because Thalassotaenia also shows some features not found in extant seagrasses, it might also represent an extinct clade of seagrasses.",2007,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology

Two-step variable selection in partially linear additive models with time series data,"ABSTRACT Lots of semi-parametric and nonparametric models are used to fit nonlinear time series data. They include partially linear time series models, nonparametric additive models, and semi-parametric single index models. In this article, we focus on fitting time series data by partially linear additive model. Combining the orthogonal series approximation and the adaptive sparse group LASSO regularization, we select the important variables between and within the groups simultaneously. Specially, we propose a two-step algorithm to obtain the grouped sparse estimators. Numerical studies show that the proposed method outperforms LASSO method in both fitting and forecasting. An empirical analysis is used to illustrate the methodology.",2018,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation

Data-driven discovery of mid-pregnancy immune markers associated with maternal lifetime stress: results from an urban pre-birth cohort.,"Changes to the maternal inflammatory milieu may be a mechanism through which maternal psychosocial stress is transmitted to the fetus. Research investigating a limited number of immune markers may miss important signals. We take a proteomics approach to investigate maternal lifetime stress and 92 biomarkers of immune system status. Participants were enrolled in an urban, dual-site (Boston, nâ€‰=â€‰301 and New York City, nâ€‰=â€‰110) pregnancy cohort. We measured maternal lifetime history of stress and trauma using the validated Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (LSC-R). We measured a panel of 92 immune-related proteins in mid-pregnancy serum using proximity extension assay technology. We leveraged the dual-site study design to perform variable selection and inference within the cohort. First, we used LASSO to select immune markers related to maternal stress among Boston mothers. Then, we performed OLS regression to examine associations between maternal stress and LASSO-selected proteins among New York City mothers. LASSO regression selected 19 immune proteins with non-null coefficients (CCL11, CCL23, CD244, CST5, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL10, CX3CL1, FGF-23, IL-5, IL-7, IL-10, IL-17C, MCP-2, MMP-1, SLAMF1, ST1A1, TNF-Î², and TWEAK). Of these, only the chemotactic cytokine CX3CL1 (i.e., fractalkine) was significantly associated with maternal stress among the validation sample (percent change in LSC-R score per 1% increase in relative fractalkine expression: 0.74, 95% confidence interval: 0.19, 1.28). Expanding research suggests fractalkine plays an important role in many aspects of pregnancy and fetal development and is stress-sensitive. We found that maternal lifetime history of stress and trauma was significantly associated with elevated serum fractalkine levels during pregnancy.",2019,Stress
GLASSOFAST : An efficient GLASSO implementation,"The GLASSO algorithm has been proposed by Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani in 2008 to solve the `1 regularized inverse covariance matrix estimation problem. The conditional dependency structure which is captured by the inverse of the covariance matrix is of interest in numerous applications and the publication of GLASSO has spurred the development of several other algorithms aimed to solve the same optimization problem.

Signal Recovery in Unions of Subspaces with Applications to Compressive Imaging,"In applications ranging from communications to genetics, signals can be modeled as lying in a union of subspaces. Under this model, signal coecients that lie in certain subspaces are active or inactive together. The potential subspaces are known in advance, but the particular set of subspaces that are active (i.e., in the signal support) must be learned from measurements. We show that exploiting knowledge of subspaces can further reduce the number of measurements required for exact signal recovery, and derive universal bounds for the number of measurements needed. The bound is universal in the sense that it only depends on the number of subspaces under consideration, and their orientation relative to each other. The particulars of the subspaces (e.g., compositions, dimensions, extents, overlaps, etc.) does not aâ†µect the results we obtain. In the process, we derive sample complexity bounds for the special case of the group lasso with overlapping groups (the latent group lasso), which is used in a variety of applications. Finally, we also show that wavelet transform coecients of images can be modeled as lying in groups, and hence can be eciently recovered using group lasso methods.",2012,arXiv: Machine Learning
Predicting radiation-induced valvular heart damage.,"PURPOSE
To develop a predictive multivariate normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model for radiation-induced heart valvular damage (RVD). The influence of combined heart-lung irradiation on RVD development was included.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Multivariate logistic regression modeling with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to build an NTCP model to predict RVD based on a cohort of 90 Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with sequential chemo-radiation therapy. In addition to heart irradiation factors, clinical variables, along with left and right lung dose-volume histogram statistics, were included in the analysis. To avoid overfitting, 10-fold cross-validation (CV) was used for LASSO logistic regression modeling, with 50 reshuffled cycles. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and Spearman's correlation coefficient (Rs).


RESULTS
At a median follow-up time of 55 months (range 12-92 months) after the end of radiation treatment, 27 of 90 patients (30%) manifested at least one kind of RVD (mild or moderate), with a higher incidence of left-sided valve defects (64%). Fourteen prognostic factors were frequently selected (more than 100/500 model fits) by LASSO, which included mainly heart and left lung dosimetric variables along with their volume variables. The averaged cross-validated performance was AUC-CV = 0.685 and Rs = 0.293. The overall performance of a final NTCP model for RVD obtained applying LASSO logistic regression to the full dataset was satisfactory (AUC = 0.84, Rs = 0.55, p < 0.001).


CONCLUSION
LASSO proved to be an improved and flexible modeling method for variable selection. Applying LASSO, we showed, for the first time, the importance of jointly considering left lung irradiation and left lung volume size in the prediction of subclinical radiation-related heart disease resulting in RVD.",2015,Acta oncologica
"After the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, Kazakhstan became an","has proven to be important as programs in developing countries seek to provide services that are responsive to women's reproductive needs. Fewer studies have examined the influence of women's status on contraceptive behavior in the former Soviet Union. Many of the factors contributing to women's status remain poorly understood, partly because of the difficulties in conceptualizing and measuring women's position (Gage, 1995). The status of women is thought to play an important role in influencing the number of children they desire, resulting fertility and the survival of their children (Vlassoff, 1992). Although many studies have shown that fertility and the spread of contraception are strongly related to the status of women, the disagreement was about the indicators of women's status. Generally, the two most useful indicators of women's status, as determined in many studies, were education and work. In this study, in addition to these two variables, family planning discussion with the partner was used. The rationale is that women who can discuss with, negotiate with, and influence their partner in the use of family planning and/or the number of children they have would be considered of higher status. Therefore these three indicators will be used in order to measure the status of women in Kazakhstan.",2000,
The Camel Bookmobile,"There is much truth to the saying that one person's utopia is another's dystopia (Nandy, 1987). This has proved true in many areas touched by modernity's Utopian project1- the paradoxical quest for freedom (freedom from want, from ignorance, from responsibility, from vulnerability) via the creation of vast systems of control (Miller, 2006). Schooling is a great example of this -we seek to free ourselves from ignorance by creating a system that confuses information with knowledge and creates institutional empires of surveillance that oppress the young, terrify and coerce parents and kill curiosity (Gatto, 2002, 2008). Like all Utopian projects, difference is trampled under foot and conformity is elevated to a virtue (Giroux, 2003). What would happen if the modernist dystopian nightmare of heterogeneity, of fractal and micro differentiation, of rhizomic multiplicity was in fact what we do best? How might our cultural systems respond? I want to suggest that we would do well to consider such a proposition. To do this it is better to apply what Louis Marin (1990) termed a utopie lens to culture and imagine a way forward less constrained by habit and violence. Let's rethink curriculum for instance. Poetry offers an interesting utopie disjunction (Greene, 2001). It turns disciplinary logic on its head by offering soft structure, analogy, rhythmic variety, cultural harmonies as a response to human need for ontological and existential coherence. Poesis in the Greek means to make or create - so teachers and students make and create knowledge via a poetic sensibility (Henderson, 2004). Poetry models this and also models form across time and culture - ancient Greek poetry, the poetry of the Mahabharata, the poetry of Shakespeare - all lay cultural foundations, all weave meaning into context if the ear, the mind and the heart are open to it (Calasso, 1993, 1999). Poetry takes a person as they are and leads them forward into what they might be - the poet suggests a perspective, a new way for the reader. A new learning. Utopian curriculum regimes take much of the creativity out of this (Scott, 1998). Poesis emphasises the 'becoming' of students and their teachers - each encounter making them anew (Semetsky, 2006). Poesis, the making of the moment, in relationship to what Deleuze and Guattari (1994) called the Chaosmos - all open ended, all full of possibility and multiple readings. To paraphrase Wallace Stevens (1990), let's take our utopie lense and look into a classroom. The students come in and see a strange site: So curriculum runs the route towards a tune beyond us, yet ourselves. It is pure rhizome, multiple, layered - like Altamira, a dark labyrinth filled with promise and mystery (Deleuze, 1987). We run the course of it, making and begetting and becoming along the way. A poetry of sorts, a shamanic shearsman leading us on into the messy wonder of it all. Poetry sketches a possible trajectory but leaves the map up to each learning context. It is inviting, playful, and rich in human moments - like a ship rich in possible destinations but also a heterotopic space in itself (Foucault, 1986). It generalizes only in order to illuminate the specific. Thus it embeds the micro in the macro and delineates the macro always present in each unique encounter. Maths, as Jardine and his colleagues (Jardine, 2006) argue so well, can be, should be poetry - not dry dust in the mouths of teachers who have forgotten how to dance. We can turn to Kevin Hart (2002) for help in all this mess and joy. Freed from constraints, students and teacher, teachers and student discover what it means to learn: This stone brimming with darkness, this weed Taking its first breath, This body intent upon the pure moment, Will change: they are leaning into the future And the future Is bending like a river bank. It is the guts of things... The future, (that place of dreams where utopia spawns a new nightmare to control the darkness chaotic), can be benevolent too. â€¦",2009,Social alternatives
Covariate-Correlated Lasso for Feature Selection,"Lasso-type variable selection has been increasingly adopted in many applications. In this paper, we propose a covariate-correlated Lasso that selects the covariates correlated more strongly with the response variable. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve this Lasso-type optimization and prove its convergence. Experiments on DNA gene expression data sets show that the selected covariates correlate more strongly with the response variable, and the residual values are decreased, indicating better covariate selection. The selected covariates lead to better classification performance.",2014,
Linear convergence of SDCA in statistical estimation,"SVRG and its variants are among the state of art optimization algorithms for large scale machine learning problems. It is well known that SVRG converges linearly when the objective function is strongly convex. However this setup can be restrictive, and does not include several important formulations such as Lasso, group Lasso, logistic regression, and some non-convex models including corrected Lasso and SCAD. In this paper, we prove that, for a class of statistical M-estimators covering examples mentioned above, SVRG solves the formulation with {\em a linear convergence rate} without strong convexity or even convexity. Our analysis makes use of {\em restricted strong convexity}, under which we show that SVRG converges linearly to the fundamental statistical precision of the model, i.e., the difference between true unknown parameter $\theta^*$ and the optimal solution $\hat{\theta}$ of the model.",2017,ArXiv
A Framework For Memory Performance Prediction From Brain Volume In Preterm-Born Adolescents,"With advances in medical care, higher numbers of extremely preterm-born babies are now surviving, however the rate of neurodevelopmental and neurological complications has not improved at the same rate and the relative rate of disabilities and health problems is increasing, with associated high costs for health care systems and education. Understanding brain development after early birth is of great importance to be able to make informed decisions. Many studies have associated different areas of the preterm brain with poor cognitive performance, however it is less clear whether these associations persist into adult life. In this study, we investigate how well cortical volumes describe memory performance in 133 19 year-old adolescents, 61% of whom were born extremely preterm. We employ LASSO to identify brain regions that better explain memory performance. The brain regions identified by LASSO explained 27% and 32% of the variance in the visual working memory scores and the visual short term memory respectively. Furthermore, the correlation between the predicted scores and validation scores is statistically significant and it is 58% for the visual working memory task and 56% for the visual short term memory task.",2019,2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019)
Learning Symmetry Features for Face Detection Based on Sparse Group Lasso,"Face detection is of fundamental importance in face recognition, facial expression recognition and other face biometrics related applications. The core problem of face detection is to select a subset of features from massive local appearance descriptors such as Haar features and LBP. This paper proposes a two stage feature selection method for face detection. Firstly, feature representation of the symmetric characteristics of face pattern is formulated as a structured sparsity problem and sparse group lasso is used to select the most effective local features for face detection. Secondly, minimal redundancy maximal relevance is used to remove the redundant features in group sparsity learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed feature selection method has better generalization ability than Adaboost and Lasso based feature selection methods for face detection problems.",2013,
A hierarchical Bayesian perspective on majorization-minimization for non-convex sparse regression: application to M/EEG source imaging,"Majorization-minimization (MM) is a standard iterative optimization technique which consists in minimizing a sequence of convex surrogate functionals. MM approaches have been particularly successful to tackle inverse problems and statistical machine learning problems where the regularization term is a sparsity-promoting concave function. However, due to non-convexity, the solution found by MM depends on its initialization. Uniform initialization is the most natural and often employed strategy as it boils down to penalizing all coefficients equally in the first MM iteration. Yet, this arbitrary choice can lead to unsatisfactory results in severely under-determined inverse problems such as source imaging with magneto- and electro-encephalography (M/EEG). The framework of hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) is an alternative approach to encode sparsity. This work shows that for certain hierarchical models, a simple alternating scheme to compute fully Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates leads to the exact same sequence of updates as a standard MM strategy (see the adaptive lasso). With this parallel outlined, we show how to improve upon these MM techniques by probing the multimodal posterior density using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Firstly, we show that these samples can provide well-informed initializations that help MM schemes to reach better local minima. Secondly, we demonstrate how it can reveal the different modes of the posterior distribution in order to explore and quantify the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of such ill-posed inference procedure. In the context of M/EEG, each mode corresponds to a plausible configuration of neural sources, which is crucial for data interpretation, especially in clinical contexts. Results on both simulations and real datasets show how the number or the type of sensors affect the uncertainties on the estimates.",2017,Inverse Problems
Identification of a three-m6A related gene risk score model as a potential prognostic biomarker in clear cell renal cell carcinoma,"Background
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been shown to play important roles in regulating gene expression and phenotypes in both health and disease. Here, our purpose is to construct a m6A-regulrator-based risk score (RS) for prediction of the prognosis of ccRCC.


Methods
We used clinical and expression data of m6A related genes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis to develop an RS to predict survival of patients with ccRCC, and analyzed correlations between RS and other clinical indicators such as age, grade and stage. Validation of this RS was then engaged in another cohort, E-MTAB-1980 from the ArrayExpress dataset. Finally, we used quantitative real-time PCR to analyze the expression profile of genes consists of the RS.


Results
A three-gene RS including METTL3, METTL14 and HNRNPA2B1 which can predict overall survival (OS) of ccRCC patients from TCGA. After applying this RS into the validation cohort from Arrayexpress, we found that it successfully reproduced the result; furthermore, the results of PCR validation were in line with our analysis.


Conclusion
To sum up, our study has identified an RS composed of m6A related genes that may predict the prognosis of ccRCC patients, which might be helpful for future therapeutic strategies. Our results call for further experimental studies for validations.",2020,PeerJ
Preoperative assessment of lymph node metastasis in clinically node-negative rectal cancer patients based on a nomogram consisting of five clinical factors,"Background: Currently, reliable approaches for accurate assessment of lymph node metastases (LNM), which is an important indication of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), are not available for clinically node-negative rectal cancer patients. This study aims to identify clinical factors associated with LNM and to establish a nomogram for LNM prediction in clinically node-negative rectal cancer patients. 
 Methods: The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) aggression and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify clinical factors associated with LNM. A nomogram was established to predict the probability of LNM in clinically node-negative rectal cancer patients based on the multivariate logistic regression model. 
 Results: Six potential risk factors were selected on the basis of LASSO aggression analysis, and five of them were identified as independent risk factors for LNM based on multivariate analysis, including MRI-reported tumor location, clinical T classification, MRI-reported tumor diameter, white blood cell count (WBC), and preoperative elevated tumor markers. A nomogram consisting of the five clinical factors was established and showed good discrimination. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the established nomogram was reliable and accurate for LNM prediction in clinically node-negative rectal cancer patients. Conclusions: A nomogram based on five clinical factors, including MRI-reported tumor location, clinical T classification, MRI-reported tumor diameter, WBC, and preoperative elevated tumor markers, are useful for assessing LNM in clinically node-negative rectal cancer patients, which is important for preoperative CRT regimens.",2019,Annals of Translational Medicine
A relative-error inertial-relaxed inexact projective splitting algorithm,"For solving structured monotone inclusion problems involving the sum of finitely many maximal monotone operators, we propose and study a relative-error inertial-relaxed inexact projective splitting algorithm. The proposed algorithm benefits from a combination of inertial and relaxation effects, which are both controlled by parameters within a certain range. We propose sufficient conditions on these parameters and study the interplay between them in order to guarantee weak convergence of sequences generated by our algorithm. Additionally, the proposed algorithm also benefits from inexact subproblem solution within a relative-error criterion. Simple numerical experiments on LASSO problems indicate some improvement when compared with previous (noninertial and exact) versions of projective splitting.",2020,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Funktionelle Aspekte von Kollagen XVI und seiner NC11-DomÃ¤ne bei der Progression des oralen Plattenepithelkarzinoms,"Kollagen XVI gehort zu der Familie der FACIT Kollagenen (fibril associated collagen with interrupted triple helix). In der oralen Mukosa ist es an der dermal-epidermalen Verbindungszone lokalisiert. Eine verstarket Kollagen XVI Expression konnte im oralen Plattenepitelkarzimom (englisch: oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)) und im Gliom beobachtet werden. 
Die Induktion der Kollagen XVI Expression in der humanen OSCC Zelllinie PCI13 zeigte eine dosisabhangigen Einfluss auf die Zellproliferation und -invasion. Zudem bewirkt die verstarkte Kollagen XVI Expression eine Hochregulation der MMP-9 Expression und die Invasion der Kollagen XVI Zellen. Bei Kollagen XVI uberexprimierenden Zellen bindet Kollagen XVI an Î²1 Integrine. Wir konnten zeigen, dass die gesteigerte Kollagen XVI Expression in diesen Zellen, abhangig von fokalen Kontakten, eine Interaktion der ILK mit Kinlin-1 verursacht. Des Weiteren fuhrt die erhohte Kollagen XVI Expression zur Aktivierung des ILK/Akt Signalweges, was wiederum uber den Transkriptionsfaktor AP-1 die Aktivierung der MMP-9 Genexpression bewirkt.
Neben dem Volllangekollagen XVI konnten wir in vitro und in Plasmaproben von OSCC-Patienten spezifische, trunkierte Formen des Kollagen XVI beobachten. Wir fanden bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht identifizierte, prozessierte Kollagen XVI Fragmente mit einem molekularen Gewicht von 100kDa, 60 kDa und 40 kDa, als auch ein Fragment, das in seiner Grose der NC11-Domane von Kollagen XVI entspricht (ca.35 kDa, bestatigt durch Massenspektrometrie). Die Uberexpression der NC11-Domane in der humane OSCC Zelllinie PCI 13 (NC11 Zellen) hat bei der Kultivierung auf MatrigelÂ® die Ausbildung von kanalahnlichen Netzstrukturen zur Folge. Gestutzt werden diese Daten durch die Beobachtung, dass die NC11 Uberexpression auch zu einer verstarkten Gen- und Proteinexpression der Rezeptoren VEGFR1, VEGFR2 und des uPa-Rezeptors fuhrt. Die spezifische VEGFR Inhibition verhindert die Ausbildung der kanalahnlichen Netzstrukturen bei NC11 Zellen. Diese Befunde lassen vermuten, dass die Uberexpression der NC11-Domane von Kollagen XVI, durch die gesteigerte Expression der endothelassoziierten Rezeptoren VEGFR1, VEGFR2 und den uPa Rezeptor, Einfluss auf die vaskulogene Mimikry der OSSC Tumorzellen nimmt.",2016,
Radiomics Features of Multiparametric MRI as Novel Prognostic Factors in Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.,"Purpose: To identify MRI-based radiomics as prognostic factors in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).Experimental Design: One-hundred and eighteen patients (training cohort: n = 88; validation cohort: n = 30) with advanced NPC were enrolled. A total of 970 radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted (T2-w) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CET1-w) MRI. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was applied to select features for progression-free survival (PFS) nomograms. Nomogram discrimination and calibration were evaluated. Associations between radiomics features and clinical data were investigated using heatmaps.Results: The radiomics signatures were significantly associated with PFS. A radiomics signature derived from joint CET1-w and T2-w images showed better prognostic performance than signatures derived from CET1-w or T2-w images alone. One radiomics nomogram combined a radiomics signature from joint CET1-w and T2-w images with the TNM staging system. This nomogram showed a significant improvement over the TNM staging system in terms of evaluating PFS in the training cohort (C-index, 0.761 vs. 0.514; P < 2.68 Ã— 10-9). Another radiomics nomogram integrated the radiomics signature with all clinical data, and thereby outperformed a nomogram based on clinical data alone (C-index, 0.776 vs. 0.649; P < 1.60 Ã— 10-7). Calibration curves showed good agreement. Findings were confirmed in the validation cohort. Heatmaps revealed associations between radiomics features and tumor stages.Conclusions: Multiparametric MRI-based radiomics nomograms provided improved prognostic ability in advanced NPC. These results provide an illustrative example of precision medicine and may affect treatment strategies. Clin Cancer Res; 23(15); 4259-69.

Improved Oracle Complexity of Variance Reduced Methods for Nonsmooth Convex Stochastic Composition Optimization,"We consider the nonsmooth convex composition optimization problem where the objective is a composition of two finite-sum functions and analyze stochastic compositional variance reduced gradient (\textsf{SCVRG}) methods for them. \textsf{SCVRG} and its variants have recently drawn much attention given their edge over stochastic compositional gradient descent (\textsf{SCGD}); but the theoretical analysis exclusively assumes strong convexity of the objective, which excludes several important examples such as Lasso, logistic regression, principle component analysis and deep neural nets. In contrast, we prove non-asymptotic incremental first-order oracle (\textsf{IFO}) complexity of \textsf{SCVRG} or its novel variants for nonsmooth convex composition optimization and show that they are provably faster than \textsf{SCGD} and gradient descent. More specifically, our method achieves the total \textsf{IFO} complexity of $O\left((m+n)\log\left(1/\epsilon\right)+1/\epsilon^3\right)$ which improves that of $O\left(1/\epsilon^{3.5}\right)$ and $O\left((m+n)/\sqrt{\epsilon}\right)$ obtained by \textsf{SCGD} and accelerated gradient descent respectively. Experiments on sparse mean-variance optimization problem demonstrates that our method outperforms other competing methods.",2018,ArXiv
"The Palynology of the Triassicâ€”Jurassic Transition in Southeastern Queensland, Australia, and Correlation with New Zealand","New evidence is presented on the Triassicâ€”Jurassic boundary in eastern Australia, based on miospore assemblages from three continuously cored drillholes which penetrated the Raceview Formation to Ripley Road succession in the eastern Clarence-Moreton Basin of southeastern Queensland. Evidence for the age of this continental succession is provided by correlation based on the first appearances of five distinctive species. These taxa first appear at or close to the Rhaetianâ€”Hettangian boundary in the marine, ammonite-dated succession of New Zealand and in the lower Ripley Road Sandstone of Queensland. The more gradual introduction of these species in the Queensland succession, as opposed to their near-synchronous appearance in New Zealand, is probably due to their gradual migration into an inland environment in contrast to their origin from a nearshore region in New Zealand. At higher levels the first appearance of intrastriate Classopollis, closely followed by its marked increase in abundance, is regarded as evidence for correlating assemblages from the upper Ripley Road Sandstone in the eastern Clarence-Moreton Basin with the earliest Sinemurian of New Zealand. The views of some previous workers that the Hettangian of eastern Australia is characterised by the appearance of abundant Classopollis must now be modified. From the aspect of biotic change, associated with climate change at the Triassicâ€”Jurassic boundary, this study indicates a rapid local change in New Zealand. A new type of biozone, the Association Zone, is proposed as a type of interval zone. The need for a distinctive biozone to characterise palynofloral assemblages is indicated to allow for the frequent recycling of palynomorphs and also to better define the body of an interval zone. New Early Jurassic miospore zones are proposed for southeastern Queensland. Granamegamonocolpites campbellii sp. nov. is described and one new combination, Anapiculatisporities helidonensis (de Jersey) comb, nov., is proposed. Morphological and stratigraphical evidence is provided for gradualism in the lineage development of intrastructure in Classopollis, from massive (unstructured), to intrapunctate, to intrastriate specimens.",2013,

The paper combines elegant theory and useful practical results in an intriguing manner. The LARâ€“Lassoâ€“boosting relationship opens the door for new insights on existing methods' underlying statistical mechanisms and for the development of new and promising methodology.

Lasso and equivalent quadratic penalized regression models,"The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) and ridge regression produce usually different estimates although input, loss function and parameterization of the penalty are identical. In this paper we look for ridge and lasso models with identical solution set. It turns out, that the lasso model with shrink vector and a quadratic penalized model with shrink matrix as outer product of with itself are equivalent, in the sense that they have equal solutions. To achieve this, we have to restrict the estimates to be positive. This doesnâ€™t limit the area of application since we can decompose every estimate in a positive and negative part. The resulting problem can be solved with a non negative least square algorithm and may benet from algorithms with high numerically accuracy. This model can also deal with mixtures of ridge and lasso penalties like the elastic net, leading to a continuous solution path as a function of the mixture proportions. Beside this quadratic penalized model, an augmented regression model with positive bounded estimates is developed which is also equivalent to the lasso model, but is probably faster to solve.",2014,
A biconvex analysis for Lasso l1 reweighting.,"l1 reweighting algorithms are very popular in sparse signal recovery and compressed sensing, since in the practice they have been observed to outperform classical l1 methods. Nevertheless, the theoretical analysis of their convergence is a critical point, and generally is limited to the convergence of the functional to a local minimum or to subsequence convergence. In this letter, we propose a new convergence analysis of a Lasso l1 reweighting method, based on the observation that the algorithm is an alternated convex search for a biconvex problem. Based on that, we are able to prove the numerical convergence of the sequence of the iterates generated by the algorithm. This is not yet the convergence of the sequence, but it is close enough for practical and numerical purposes. Furthermore, we propose an alternative iterative soft thresholding procedure, which is faster than the main algorithm.",2018,arXiv: Learning
Quantitative Chemical Analysis of Archaeological Slag Material Using Handheld X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry,"Handheld X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) has seen a dramatic increase in use for archaeological projects. The attraction of the technique is its portable and nondestructive nature. In many cases, the archaeological artefacts in question cannot be destructively sampled, or the piece itself cannot be sent to an analytical laboratory. One of the current research interests associated with the Sagalassos project is the study of the Roman iron industry. Previously exported iron slag and ore from the site and the surrounding area was subjected to laboratory chemical analyses. These indicated that different ores were being utilized in the production of iron in different periods. In order to further the project the slag material still in the site depot needed to be analyzed. However, recent legislative changes mean that materials can only be analyzed on-site. Since samples could not be taken and destructive chemical analysis was no longer feasible, a portable, nondestructive technique was required. Handheld XRF can easily provide qualitative data, but these data are only comparable to other handheld XRF qualitative data, from the same device. Quantitative data gathering is possible, but can be more problematic, particularly when the material in question is heterogeneous in nature. A calibration file was created using the manufacturerâ€™s software and â€œin-houseâ€ standards made from the pre-quantified samples of iron slag available in the laboratory. In order to make the calibration as robust as possible, the composition of the standards was analyzed statistically to determine which of these created bias and leverage for specific elements. These standards were then omitted from the calibration for that element. The calibration was tested in the laboratory using samples of iron slag previously analyzed with wet chemistry, and the results indicated that most sample analyses showed <30% error. Results with a >30% error were found in samples which contained very low or very high quantities of the analyzed element, i.e., outside the limits of the calibration. The handheld XRF and the associated calibration file were then used to provide a semi-quantified chemical characterization of the samples in the field depot.",2016,Applied Spectroscopy
Simultaneous Support Recovery in High Dimensions: Benefits and Perils of Block $\ell _{1}/\ell _{\infty} $-Regularization,"Given a collection of <i>r</i> â‰¥ 2 linear regression problems in <i>p</i> dimensions, suppose that the regression coefficients share partially common supports of size at most <i>s</i>. This set-up suggests the use of â„“<sub>1</sub>/â„“<sub>âˆž</sub>-regularized regression for joint estimation of the <i>p</i>Ã—<i>r</i> matrix of regression coefficients. We analyze the high-dimensional scaling of â„“<sub>1</sub>/â„“<sub>âˆž</sub>-regularized quadratic programming, considering both consistency rates in â„“<sub>âˆž</sub>-norm, and how the minimal sample size <i>n</i> required for consistent variable selection scales with model dimension, sparsity, and overlap between the supports. We first establish bounds on the â„“<sub>âˆž</sub>-error as well sufficient conditions for exact variable selection for fixed design matrices, as well as for designs drawn randomly from general Gaussian distributions. Specializing to the case <i>r</i> = 2 linear regression problems with standard Gaussian designs whose supports overlap in a fraction Î± âˆˆ [0,1] of their entries, we prove that â„“<sub>1</sub>/â„“<sub>âˆž</sub>-regularized method undergoes a phase transition characterized by the rescaled sample size Î¸<sub>1,âˆž</sub>(<i>n</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>s</i>, Î±) = <i>n</i>/{(4 - 3 Î±) <i>s</i> log(<i>p</i>-(2- Î±) <i>s</i>)}. An implication is that the use of â„“<sub>1</sub>/â„“<sub>âˆž</sub>-regularization yields improved statistical efficiency if the overlap parameter is large enough ( Î± >; 2/3), but has worse statistical efficiency than a naive Lasso-based approach for moderate to small overlap (Î± <; 2/3 ). Empirical simulations illustrate the close agreement between theory and actual behavior in practice. These results show that caution must be exercised in applying <i>â„“</i><sub>1</sub>/â„“<sub>âˆž</sub> block regularization: if the data does not match its structure very closely, it can impair statistical performance relative to computationally less expensive schemes.",2011,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
Leveraging UMLS-driven NLP to enhance identification of influenza predictors derived from electronic medical record data,"Objective Multiple clinical prediction rules have been developed, but lack validation. This study aims to identify a set of prediction algorithms for influenza, based on electronic health record (EHR) structured data and clinical notes derived data using Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) driven natural language processing (NLP). Materials and Methods Data were extracted from an enterprise-wide data warehouse for all patients who tested positive for influenza and were seen in ambulatory care between 2009 and 2019 (N = 7,278). A text processing pipeline was used to analyze chart notes for UMLS terms for symptoms of interest to improve data quality completeness. Three models, which step up complexity of the dataset and predictors, were tested with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-selected parameters to identify predictors for influenza. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves compared test accuracy across the three models. Results Three models identified 7, 8, and 10 predictors, and the most complex model performed best. The addition of the UMLS-driven NLP symptoms data improved data quality (false negatives) and increased the number of significant predictors. NLP also increased the strength of the models, as did the addition of two-way predictor interactions. Discussion The EHR is a feasible source for offering rapidly accessible datasets for influenza related prediction research that was used to produce a prediction model for influenza. Combining data collected in routine care with data science methods improved a prediction model for influenza, and in the future, could be used to drive diagnostics at the point of care.",2020,bioRxiv
"Two new species of freshwater, cave-dwelling crabs of the genus Neostrengeria Pretzmann, 1965, from Colombia (Crustacea: Decapoda: Pseudothelphusidae).","Two new species of freshwater crabs of the pseudothelphusid genus Neostrengeria Pretzmann, 1965, N. fernandezi n. sp., and N. lassoi n. sp., are described.

"Effects of Heat on the Infecting, Antibody-absorbing, and Interfering Powers of Vaccinia Virus.","Galasso, G. J. (University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill), and D. G. Sharp. Effects of heat on the infecting, antibody-absorbing, and interfering powers of vaccinia virus. J. Bacteriol. 89:611-616. 1965.-At 56 C the infectivity of vaccinia virus particles is destroyed rapidly, but even when it is reduced by a factor of 10(6) the particles are capable of producing strong interference in L cells. The rate constant K for thermal inactivation of plaque-forming power is greater than that for interfering power by the factor e(3.8) or about 45 times. At 37 C both properties of the virus decline more slowly and at equal rates. The temperature coefficient of K is discontinuous in the region of 40 C, indicating quite different activation energies for the reactions above and below this critical point. The degradation of interfering power exhibits a similar discontinuity, although less in magnitude, but none has been found in the antibody-reactive power of the virus, which is much more heat resistant.",1965,Journal of bacteriology
"Penalized regression methods with application to generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and smoothing","Recently, penalized regression has been used for dealing problems which found in maximum likelihood estimation such as correlated parameters and a large number of predictors. The main issues in this regression is how to select the optimal model. In this thesis, Schallâ€™s algorithm is proposed as an automatic selection of weight of penalty. The algorithm has two steps. First, the coefficient estimates are obtained with an arbitrary penalty weight. Second, an estimate of penalty weight Î» can be calculated by the ratio of the variance of error and the variance of coefficient. The iteration is continued from step one until an estimate of penalty weight converge. The computational cost is minimized because the optimal weight of penalty could be obtained within a small number of iterations. 
In this thesis, Schallâ€™s algorithm is investigated for ridge regression, lasso regression and two-dimensional histogram smoothing. The proposed algorithm are applied to real data sets and simulation data sets. In addition, a new algorithm for lasso regression is proposed. The performance of results of the algorithm was almost comparable in all applications. Schallâ€™s algorithm can be an efficient algorithm for selection of weight of penalty.",2017,
Generalized group sparse classifiers with application in fMRI brain decoding,"The perplexing effects of noise and high feature dimensionality greatly complicate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classification. In this paper, we present a novel formulation for constructing â€œGeneralized Group Sparse Classifiersâ€ (GSSC) to alleviate these problems. In particular, we propose an extension of group LASSO that permits associations between features within (predefined) groups to be modeled. Integrating this new penalty into classifier learning enables incorporation of additional prior information beyond group structure. In the context of fMRI, GGSC provides a flexible means for modeling how the brain is functionally organized into specialized modules (i.e. groups of voxels) with spatially proximal voxels often displaying similar level of brain activity (i.e. feature associations). Applying GSSC to real fMRI data improved predictive performance over standard classifiers, while providing more neurologically interpretable classifier weight patterns. Our results thus demonstrate the importance of incorporating prior knowledge into classification problems.",2011,CVPR 2011
Isolation and structure determination of a new lasso peptide specialicin based on genome mining.,"Based on genome mining, a new lasso peptide specialicin was isolated from the extract of Streptomyces specialis. The structure of specialicin was established by ESI-MS and NMR analyses to be a lasso peptide with the length of 21 amino acids, containing an isopeptide bond and two disulfide bonds in the molecule. The stereochemistries of the constituent amino acids except for Trp were determined to be L and the stereochemistry of Trp at C-terminus was determined to be D. Three dimensional structure of specialicin was determined based on NOE experimental data, which indicated that specialicin possessed the similar conformational structure with siamycin I. Specialicin showed the antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus and the moderate anti-HIV activity against HIV-1 NL4-3.

The FuSSO does so in a semi-parametric fashion, making no parametric assumptions about the nature of input functional covariates and assuming a linear form to the mapping of functional covariates to the response.

High-order covariate interacted Lasso for feature selection,"High-order covariates interaction is considered into Lasso-type variable selection.We evaluate the significance of feature by considering their neighborhood dependency.Having too few features in not necessarily a good feature selection result.Some interactive features may be lost in the process of removing redundancy. Lasso-type feature selection has been demonstrated to be effective in handling high dimensional data. Most existing Lasso-type models over emphasize the sparsity and overlook the interactions among covariates. Here on the other hand, we devise a new regularization term in the Lasso regression model to impose high order interactions between covariates and responses. Specifically, we first construct a feature hypergraph to model the high-order relations among covariates, in which each node corresponds to a covariate and each hyperedge has a weight corresponding to the interaction information among covariates connected by that hyperedge. For the hyperedge weight, we use multidimensional interaction information (MII) to measure the significance of different covariate combinations with respect to response. Secondly, we use the feature hypergraph as a regularizer on the covariate coefficients which can automatically adjust the relevance measure between a covariate and the response by the interaction weights obtained from hypergraph. Finally, an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is presented to solve the resulting sparse optimization problem. Extensive experiments on different data sets show that although our proposed model is not a convex problem, it outperforms both its approximately convex counterparts and a number of state-of-the-art feature selection methods.",2017,Pattern Recognit.

GRASPEL: Graph Spectral Learning at Scale,"Learning meaningful graphs from data plays important roles in many data mining and machine learning tasks, such as data representation and analysis, dimension reduction, data clustering, and visualization, etc. In this work, for the first time, we present a highly-scalable spectral approach (GRASPEL) for learning large graphs from data. By limiting the precision matrix to be a graph Laplacian, our approach aims to estimate ultra-sparse (tree-like) weighted undirected graphs and shows a clear connection with the prior graphical Lasso method. By interleaving the latest high-performance nearly-linear time spectral methods for graph sparsification, coarsening and embedding, ultra-sparse yet spectrally-robust graphs can be learned by identifying and including the most spectrally-critical edges into the graph. Compared with prior state-of-the-art graph learning approaches, GRASPEL is more scalable and allows substantially improving computing efficiency and solution quality of a variety of data mining and machine learning applications, such as spectral clustering (SC), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). {For example, when comparing with graphs constructed using existing methods, GRASPEL achieved the best spectral clustering efficiency and accuracy.",2019,ArXiv
Errors-in-variables models with dependent measurements,"Suppose that we observe $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ in the following errors-in-variables model: \begin{eqnarray*} y & = & X_0 \beta^* + \epsilon X & = & X_0 + W \end{eqnarray*} where $X_0$ is a $n \times m$ design matrix with independent subgaussian row vectors, $\epsilon \in \R^n$ is a noise vector and $W$ is a mean zero $n \times m$ random noise matrix with independent subgaussian column vectors, independent of $X_0$ and $\epsilon$. This model is significantly different from those analyzed in the literature in the sense that we allow the measurement error for each covariate to be a dependent vector across its $n$ observations. Such error structures appear in the science literature when modeling the trial-to-trial fluctuations in response strength shared across a set of neurons. 
We establish consistency in estimating $\beta^*$ and obtain the rates of convergence in the $\ell_q$ norm, where $q = 1, 2$ for the Lasso-type estimator, and for $q \in [1, 2]$ for a Dantzig-type conic programming estimator. We show error bounds which approach that of the regular Lasso and the Dantzig selector in case the errors in $W$ are tending to 0. We analyze the convergence rates of the gradient descent methods for solving the nonconvex programs and show that the composite gradient descent algorithm is guaranteed to converge at a geometric rate to a neighborhood of the global minimizers: the size of the neighborhood is bounded by the statistical error in the $\ell_2$ norm. Our analysis reveals interesting connections between compuational and statistical efficiency and the concentration of measure phenomenon in random matrix theory. We provide simulation evidence illuminating the theoretical predictions.",2016,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Dependence estimation and controlled CVaR portfolio optimization of a highly kurtotic Australian mining sample of stocks,"The drivers of mining stock prices are known to be several. Sharp spikes on the stocks return distribution have been linked to the presence of unusually high volatility signifying the presence of high levels of kurtosis. The accurate measurement of the stocks' underlying co-movements for more accurate CVaR portfolio optimization requires, therefore, the utilization of sophisticated and specific-specialized techniques which could adequately capture and model these characteristics. Here this issue is addressed by applying statistical-graphical models for dependence estimation. Twenty mining stocks, out of the 801 listed in the ASX as of December 2012, have been selected for the analysis under the criteria of satisfying the eight years trading period sought, having very weak or no autocorrelation of residuals and displaying the highest kurtosis. Models' estimations of dependence are compared and inserted into a differential evolution algorithm for non-convex global optimization in order to conduct risk controlled CVaR portfolio optimization (Ardia, Boudt, Carl, Mullen & Peterson, 2011) and be able to identify the one yielding the highest portfolio return. The findings are of relevance in portfolio allocation and portfolio risk management. Energy and mining stock markets are subjected to numerous price drivers holding complex relationships. The dynamics of production and consumption based on seasonality features, transportation and storage, weather conditions, commodity price fluctuations, currency changes, market confidence and expectations, trading speculations and the domestic and international states of the economy impact mining stock prices in particular and unobvious ways reflected in high volatility with sudden spikes in the stock's return distribution (Pilipovic, 1998). The generation of accurate measurements of the dependence matrix of mining stock's return series is therefore both, a non-trivial task due to the hard to decipher characteristics present in return series suffering from high levels of kurtosis (Carvalho, Lopes & Aguilar, 2010) and, a crucial element in portfolio optimization and portfolio risk management. The use of graphical techniques in this study is justified on the basis of their utility and suitableness. Graphical models such as pair c-vine copulas, the graphical lasso and adaptive graphical lasso provide, for instance, the visualization and flexibility to represent a problem in a more simplified and dissected form (Lauritzen, 1996). Graphs also appear to be naturally adequate to express the interaction of variables and thus facilitate the analysis of their dependency. The models of dependence estimation and CVaR portfolio optimization, on the other hand, are desirable due to mathematical and statistical framework they provide which may lead to satisfactory results and, their apparent ability to overcome the flaws (i.e. standardized model application to all joint distributions, restrictive and deterministic linear and monotonic modelling functions as in the Pearson and Spearman) traditional measures display when dealing with highly kurtotic data, joint distributions with stronger dependence in the tails and controlled risk non-convex portfolio optimization problems. Findings indicate that the highest portfolio returns are generated by inserting the covariance output matrix from the student-t copula into the differential optimization algorithm and, the student-t copula fitting with separate modelling of the marginal distributions appears to be the most desirable modelling choice. The portfolio return by the adaptive graphical lasso is lower than that of the student-t and is followed by the Gaussian pair c-vine copula. The regular graphical lasso produced the lowest portfolio return and the covariance matrix values were higher for models producing the highest portfolio returns implying that the models generating the lowest portfolio returns underestimated the dependence of the assets. The implications of the findings suggest that specific modelling of each marginal distribution, as compared to modelling based on a Gaussian framework, may lead to an edge in the estimations due to the distribution differences encountered on each marginal. Furthermore, the ability of the model to capture dependence in the tails, as it is the case of the student-t copula, does provide a modelling advantage too. This paper appears to be the first one in, comparing the portfolio performance of the models of dependence estimation in the context of controlled CVaR, applying the models treated to a highly kurtotic mining sample of stocks from the Australian market and modelling separately the distribution of the marginals when fitting the student-t copula.",2013,
Refocusing the lens on engagement in MOOCs,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) continue to see increasing enrollment and adoption by universities, although they are still not fully understood and could perhaps be significantly improved. For example, little is known about the relationships between the ways in which students choose to use MOOCs (e.g., sampling lecture videos, discussing topics with fellow students) and their overall level of engagement with the course, although these relationships are likely key to effective course implementation. In this paper we propose a multilevel definition of student engagement with MOOCs and explore the connections between engagement and students' behaviors across five unique courses. We modeled engagement using ordinal penalized logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and found several predictors of engagement that were consistent across courses. In particular, we found that discussion activities (e.g., viewing forum posts) were positively related to engagement, whereas other types of student behaviors (e.g., attempting quizzes) were consistently related to less engagement with the course. Finally, we discuss implications of unexpected findings that replicated across courses, future work to explore these implications, and relevance of our findings for MOOC course design.",2018,Proceedings of the Fifth Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale
An outcome model for human bladder cancer: A comprehensive study based on weighted gene coâ€expression network analysis,"The precision evaluation of prognosis is crucial for clinical treatment decision of bladder cancer (BCa). Therefore, establishing an effective prognostic model for BCa has significant clinical implications. We performed WGCNA and DEG screening to initially identify the candidate genes. The candidate genes were applied to construct a LASSO Cox regression analysis model. The effectiveness and accuracy of the prognostic model were tested by internal/external validation and pan-cancer validation and time-dependent ROC. Additionally, a nomogram based on the parameter selected from univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis was constructed. Eight genes were eventually screened out as progression-related differentially expressed candidates in BCa. LASSO Cox regression analysis identified 3 genes to build up the outcome model in E-MTAB-4321 and the outcome model had good performance in predicting patient progress free survival of BCa patients in discovery and test set. Subsequently, another three datasets also have a good predictive value for BCa patients' OS and DFS. Time-dependent ROC indicated an ideal predictive accuracy of the outcome model. Meanwhile, the nomogram showed a good performance and clinical utility. In addition, the prognostic model also exhibits good performance in pan-cancer patients. Our outcome model was the first prognosis model for human bladder cancer progression prediction via integrative bioinformatics analysis, which may aid in clinical decision-making.",2019,Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine
"Cinematographical Studies, 1930â€“1939: An Overlooked Decade","Biomechanical researchers who analyze data collected cinematographically usually acknowledge the work of late 19th-century cinematographers Eadweard Muybridge (United States and England), Etienne J. Marey (France), Christian W. Braune, and Otto Fisher (Germany). The acknowledgement is then typically followed by a review of the current literature. But most of these studies delete the significant â€œmiddle generationâ€ of cinematographersâ€”1930â€“1939â€”a particularly fruitful decade during which motion pictures were used to help identify biomechanical principles. This discussion will focus on the cinematographical studies of W.O. Fern, H. Elftman, R.B. Glassow, E. Jokl, and T.K. Cureton, who have given biomechanics a rich legacy and helped define the discipline as it exists today.",1985,Quest
"""On that Day when the Long-horned Bull was Lassoed..."" (PT[254]286) - A Scene in the ""Corridor of the Bull"" of the Cenotaph of Sethos I in Abydos: an Iconologic Approach","The present article analyses a scene located in the so-called ?Corridor of the Bull"" in the cenotaph of king Sethos I in Abydos, in which king Ramesses II and his eldest son, prince Amenhirkhopshef, are represented lassoing a bull. The iconographic treatment of the animal and human figures evidences, in our opinion, two levels of interpretation: 1) religious; from a specific meaning centred on what we believe was a ritualistic Osirian practice, 2) political; revealed through what the figures explain and how they complement one another. By using an iconologic approach, we offer an alternative explanation based on the valuable information contained in this relief.",2002,Studien zur AltÃ¤gyptischen Kultur
Selection of sparse vine copulas in high dimensions with the Lasso,"We propose a novel structure selection method for high-dimensional ($$d > 100$$d>100) sparse vine copulas. Current sequential greedy approaches for structure selection require calculating spanning trees in hundreds of dimensions and fitting the pair copulas and their parameters iteratively throughout the structure selection process. Our method uses a connection between the vine and structural equation models. The later can be estimated very fast using the Lasso, also in very high dimensions, to obtain sparse models. Thus, we obtain a structure estimate independently of the chosen pair copulas and parameters. Additionally, we define the novel concept of regularization paths for R-vine matrices. It relates sparsity of the vine copula model in terms of independence copulas to a penalization coefficient in the structural equation models. We illustrate our approach and provide many numerical examples. These include simulations and data applications in high dimensions, showing the superiority of our approach to other existing methods.",2019,Statistics and Computing

The fluvial terraces, which have been developed since late Pleistocene, were investigated. The main findings were as follows; 1) That Kangneung terrace I had been formed in the climax period of the Last Interglacial (Oxygen isotope stage 5e) was revealed. It was estimated that Kangneung terrace II had been formed during a certain warmer period between the climax period of the Last Interglacial and the early Last Glacial(probably Oxygen isotope stage 5c or 5a). 2) Being judged from the relative heights of the Kangneung terrace I and II, the sea levels of the formation periods of these terraces were estimated to have been relatively 17~20m and l0m higher than the present sea level, respectively. 3) The formation periods of the Wangsan terrace I and II were supposed to be the early and late Last Glacial respectively, being judged from the following 3 details ; a) the characteristics of the terrace deposits, b) the relation Wangsan terrace II to the buried valley floor, and c) the cross phenomena of the above two terraces to the Kangneung terraces. 4) The formation period of the pseudogleyed red soil in the Kangneung terrace I was estimated to be the middle or late period of the Last Interglacial.ã€‘",1993,
Regularized regression method for genome-wide association studies,"We use a novel penalized approach for genome-wide association study that accounts for the linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers. This method uses a penalty on the difference of the genetic effect at adjacent single-nucleotide polymorphisms and combines it with the minimax concave penalty, which has been shown to be superior to the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in terms of estimator bias and selection consistency. Our method is implemented using a coordinate descent algorithm. The value of the tuning parameters is determined by extended Bayesian information criteria. The leave-one-out method is used to compute p-values of selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Its applicability to a simulated data from Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 replication one is illustrated. Our method selects three SNPs (C13S522, C13S523, and C13S524), whereas the LASSO method selects two SNPs (C13S522 and C13S523).",2011,BMC Proceedings
Mass Spectrometry Imaging enables Discrimination of Renal Oncocytoma from Renal Cell Cancer Subtypes and Normal Kidney Tissues.,"Precise diagnosis and subtyping of kidney tumors are imperative to optimize and personalize treatment decision for patients. Patients with the most common benign renal tumor, renal oncocytomas (RO), may be over-treated with surgical resection due to limited pre-operative diagnostic methods that can accurately identify the benign condition with certainty. In this study, desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) mass spectrometry imaging was applied to study the metabolic and lipid profiles of various types of renal tissues, including normal kidney, RO, and renal cell carcinomas (RCC). A total of 73,992 mass spectra from 71 patient samples were obtained and used to build predictive models using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso). Overall accuracies of 99.47% per-pixel and 100% per-patient for prediction of the three tissue types was achieved. In particular, RO and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC), which present the most significant morphologic overlap and are sometimes indistinguishable using histology alone, were also investigated and the predictive models built yielded 100% accuracy in discriminating these tumor types. Discrimination of three subtypes of RCC was also achieved based on DESI-MS imaging data. Importantly, several small metabolites and lipids species were identified as characteristic of individual tissue types and chemically characterized using tandem MS and high mass accuracy measurements. Collectively, our study shows that the metabolic data acquired by DESI-MS imaging in conjunction with statistical modeling allows discrimination of renal tumors, and thus has the potential to be used in the clinical setting to improve treatment of kidney tumor patients.",2019,Cancer research
Development of soft sensor with neural network and nonlinear variable selection for crude distillation unit process,"Abstract This study focuses on the development of a neural network-based soft sensor for the estimation of the product properties for real-time monitoring and control in the crude distillation unit (CDU) process. There are a large number of predictor variables displaying a high level of cross-correlation in the CDU process, which increase complexity of the model and lower the model accuracy. Therefore, a novel variable selection method for neural network that can be applied to describe nonlinear industrial processes is developed to solve the problem. The proposed method is an iterative two-step approach. Firstly, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is constructed. Secondly, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is introduced to select the input variables that are truly essential to the model with the shrinkage parameter is determined using a cross-validation method. Then, variables whose input weights are zero are eliminated from the dataset. The algorithm is repeated until there is no improvement in the model accuracy. The results show that the model constructed by the proposed soft sensor could successfully follow the dynamics of the CDU process. In addition, the superiority of the proposed approach is illustrated by the comparison with other state-of-art methods. It turns out that the proposed approach can build a more compact model and present higher level of prediction accuracy than other existing methods.",2016,Computer-aided chemical engineering
