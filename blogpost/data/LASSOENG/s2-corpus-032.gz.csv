Lasso Peptide Bioengineering and Bioprospecting,"Lasso peptides are ribosomally synthesized, post-translationally modified peptides produced by bacteria. They share an interlocked topology, consisting of a macrolactam ring at the N-terminus and a C-terminal tail that is threaded through the ring and is firmly trapped inside. This compact and constrained structure gives high stability to lasso peptides, which can thus be applied as a molecular framework for developing bioactive peptides. The chemical and genetic diversity of lasso peptides is revealed by mining microbial genomes. This chapter will present concepts and advances on lasso peptide engineering as well as information gained from genome-mining studies. To conclude, perspectives in the lasso peptide research will be discussed.",2015,
An efficient algorithm for a class of fused lasso problems,"The fused Lasso penalty enforces sparsity in both the coefficients and their successive differences, which is desirable for applications with features ordered in some meaningful way. The resulting problem is, however, challenging to solve, as the fused Lasso penalty is both non-smooth and non-separable. Existing algorithms have high computational complexity and do not scale to large-size problems. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Fused Lasso Algorithm (EFLA) for optimizing this class of problems. One key building block in the proposed EFLA is the Fused Lasso Signal Approximator (FLSA). To efficiently solve FLSA, we propose to reformulate it as the problem of finding an ""appropriate"" subgradient of the fused penalty at the minimizer, and develop a Subgradient Finding Algorithm (SFA). We further design a restart technique to accelerate the convergence of SFA, by exploiting the special ""structures"" of both the original and the reformulated FLSA problems. Our empirical evaluations show that, both SFA and EFLA significantly outperform existing solvers. We also demonstrate several applications of the fused Lasso.",2010,
Penalized Least Squares methods for solving the EEG Inverse Problem,"Most of the known solutions (linear and nonlinear) of the ill-posed EEG Inverse Problem can be interpreted as the estimated coefficients in a penalized regression framework. In this work we present a general formulation of this problem as a Multiple Penalized Least Squares model, which encompasses many of the previously known methods as particular cases (e.g., Minimum Norm, LORETA). New types of inverse solutions arise since recent advances in the field of penalized regression have made it possible to deal with non-convex penalty functions, which provide sparse solutions (Fan and Li (2001)). Moreover, a generalization of this approach allows the use of any combination of penalties based on l1 or l2-norms, leading to solutions with combined properties such as smoothness and sparsity. Synthetic data is used to explore the benefits of non-convex penalty functions (e.g., LASSO, SCAD and LASSO Fusion) and mixtures (e.g., Elastic Net and LASSO Fused) by comparing them with known solutions in terms of localization error, blurring and visibility. Real data is used to show that a mixture model (Elastic Net) allows for tuning the spatial resolution of the solution to range from very concentrated to very blurred sources.",2008,Statistica Sinica
New Error Analysis for Lasso,"The Lasso is one of the most important approaches for parameter estimation and variable selection in high dimensional linear regression. At the heart of its success is the attractive rate of convergence result even when $p$, the dimension of the problem, is much larger than the sample size $n$. In particular, Bickel et al. (2009) showed that this rate, in terms of the $\ell_1$ norm, is of the order $s\sqrt{(\log p)/n}$ for a sparsity index $s$. In this paper, we obtain a new bound on the convergence rate by taking advantage of the distributional information of the model. Under the normality or sub-Gaussian assumption, the rate can be improved to nearly $s/\sqrt{n}$ for certain design matrices. We further outline a general partitioning technique that helps to derive sharper convergence rate for the Lasso. The result is applicable to many covariance matrices suitable for high-dimensional data analysis.",2011,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Polyphasic approach for assessing changes in an autochthonous marine bacterial community in the presence of Prestige fuel oil and its biodegradation potential,"A laboratory experiment was conducted to identify key hydrocarbon degraders from a marine oil spill sample (Prestige fuel oil), to ascertain their role in the degradation of different hydrocarbons, and to assess their biodegradation potential for this complex heavy oil. After a 17-month enrichment in weathered fuel, the bacterial community, initially consisting mainly of Methylophaga species, underwent a major selective pressure in favor of obligate hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms, such as Alcanivorax and Marinobacter spp. and other hydrocarbon-degrading taxa (Thalassospira and Alcaligenes), and showed strong biodegradation potential. This ranged from >99% for all low- and medium-molecular-weight alkanes (C15â€“C27) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (C0- to C2- naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, dibenzothiophene, and carbazole), to 75â€“98% for higher molecular-weight alkanes (C28â€“C40) and to 55â€“80% for the C3 derivatives of tricyclic and tetracyclic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (e.g., C3-chrysenes), in 60Â days. The numbers of total heterotrophs and of n-alkane-, aliphatic-, and PAH degraders, as well as the structures of these populations, were monitored throughout the biodegradation process. The salinity of the counting medium affects the counts of PAH degraders, while the carbon source (n-hexadecane vs. a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons) is a key factor when counting aliphatic degraders. These limitations notwithstanding, some bacterial genera associated with hydrocarbon degradation (mainly belonging to Î±- and Î³-Proteobacteria, including the hydrocarbonoclastic Alcanivorax and Marinobacter) were identified. We conclude that Thalassospira and Roseobacter contribute to the degradation of aliphatic hydrocarbons, whereas Mesorhizobium and Muricauda participate in the degradation of PAHs.",2011,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology
"Initial experience using a forward directed, high-intensity focused ultrasound balloon catheter for pulmonary vein antrum isolation in patients with atrial fibrillation.","BACKGROUND
A high-intensity-focused ultrasound balloon catheter (HIFU-BC) is designed to isolate pulmonary veins (PV) outside the ostia (PV antrum). This catheter uses a parabolic CO2 balloon (behind water balloon) to focus a 20-, 25-, or 30-mm diameter ring of ultrasound forward of the balloon (parallel to catheter shaft). The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of the HIFU-BC for PV antrum isolation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).


METHODS AND RESULTS
Twenty-seven patients with paroxysmal (19 patients) or persistent (8 patients) AF were studied. Double transseptal puncture was performed for left atrial deployment of a Lasso catheter (for PV mapping) and the 14 Fr HIFU-BC. The HIFU-BC was positioned outside the PV orifice over a guidewire. HIFU energy (acoustic power 45 watts) was applied for 40 seconds with a 20-mm sonicating ring and 40 or 60 seconds with a 25-mm or 30-mm sonicating ring. No other ablation system was utilized. PV antrum isolation was attempted using HIFU-BC in 78 of 104 PVs (25/27 RSPVs, all 23 LSPVs, all 23 LIPVs, all four left common trunks and 3/27 RIPVs). HIFU-BC successfully isolated 68 (87%) of the 78PV antra with 1-26 (median 3) HIFU applications. The complications include transient bleeding from a distal branch of the left superior PV resulting from guidewire manipulation in one patient and right phrenic nerve injury in another patient. No PV stenosis (>50% narrowing) and no LA-esophageal fistula occurred. At the 12-month follow-up, 16 (59%) of the 27 patients were free of symptomatic episodes of AF (only 3 of the 16 patients were receiving antiarrhythmic medications).


CONCLUSIONS
Forward-focused HIFU applications isolated PVs outside the PV ostium with elimination of AF in 16 (59%) of the 27 patients at 12 months following the single ablation procedure.",2007,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology
Penalized EM algorithm and copula skeptic graphical models for inferring networks for mixed variables,"In this article, we consider the problem of reconstructing networks for continuous, binary, count and discrete ordinal variables by estimating sparse precision matrix in Gaussian copula graphical models. We propose two approaches: $\ell_1$ penalized extended rank likelihood with Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm (copula EM glasso) and copula skeptic with pair-wise copula estimation for copula Gaussian graphical models. The proposed approaches help to infer networks arising from nonnormal and mixed variables. We demonstrate the performance of our methods through simulation studies and analysis of breast cancer genomic and clinical data and maize genetics data.",2014,arXiv: Methodology
Cryptic Density Dependence: Effects of Covariation between Density and Site Quality in Reef Fish,"The importance and strength of density dependence continues to engender debate because of its central importance to population dynamics and regulation. Here, we show how confounding effects of site quality can mask strong effects of density dependence. In particular, we explore spatiotemporal variation and covariation among (1) densities of newly settled coral reef fish (Thalassoma hardwicke), (2) environmental characteristics, and (3) the strength of density-dependent mortality. Environmental features of patch reefs were spatially and temporally variable and influenced density-dependent survival. Higher- quality sites (i.e., reefs possessing features that yield greater numbers of recruits at any given settlement level) received greater settlement, and this relationship masked the op- eration of density dependence when variation in quality among sites (or times) was not distinguished (a common approach in many observational studies of density dependence). Our work illustrates how spatiotemporal covariation in settlement density and site quality can obscure patterns of density dependence at larger scales, contributing to a phenomenon we call ''cryptic density dependence.'' Acknowledging patterns and consequences of co- variance may alter the way we study population dynamics, especially of marine organisms, where the link between processes that affect settlement and post-settlement survival remains relatively poorly understood.",2003,Ecology
Impact of left atrial size on the outcome of wide area circumferential ablation vs lasso-guided pulmonary vein isolation,"AA drugs and duration of pAF was 6.4 5.6 yrs, and in LALA pts mean age was 61.4 10 yrs, LVEF 60 9%, LA size 3.3 2.1, 18 pts failed AA drugs, and duration of pAF was 8.1 6.8 yrs (all p NS for AVPI vs. LALA pts). Using only 5 mm tip catheters, APVI was performed at 50 watts and 52Â°C guided by a LassoTM catheter, and LALA was performed at 50watts and 55Â°C guided by the ESI NAVXTM system until electrogram amplitude was 0.5 mv. Post-ablation all AVPI pts were followed up at 1 and every 6 mos and LALA pts at 1 and 6 mos for symptomatic pAF and ECGs were obtained. Results: There were no complications with APVI or LALA. Fluoroscopy time was 119 32 min for APVI and 139 22 min for LALA. Post-APVI at 22.7 4.4 mos 8 pts (40%) had recurrent AF, and post-LALA at 3.6 2.2 mos 1 pt (5%) had recurrent AF. After APVI no pts (0%) had LA flutter (LAFL), whereas after LALA 7 pts (35%) had LAFL. After repeat APVI 5 pts had no AF recurrence, and 3 are improved with or without AA drugs. LAFL after LALA required repeat ablation in 1 pt, and 6 pts have had no recurrence after cardioversion on AA drugs. Conclusions: 1) Our new LALA approach results in a higher cure rate of pAF than APVI. 2) LAFL is more common after LALA than after APVI. 3) LAFL may require ablation, but can be controlled with AA drugs and may revolve with followup.",2005,Heart Rhythm
Active odor cancellation,"Noise cancellation is a traditional problem in statistical signal processing that has not been studied in the olfactory domain for unwanted odors. In this paper, we use the newly discovered olfactory white signal class to formulate optimal active odor cancellation using both nuclear norm-regularized multivariate regression and simultaneous sparsity or group lasso-regularized non-negative regression. As an example, we show the proposed technique on real-world data to cancel the odor of durian, katsuobushi, sauerkraut, and onion.",2014,2014 IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing (SSP)
Hierarchical Incomplete Multi-source Feature Learning for Spatiotemporal Event Forecasting,"Forecasting significant societal events is an interesting and challenging problem as it taking into consideration multiple aspects of a society, including its economics, politics, and culture. Traditional forecasting methods based on a single data source find it hard to cover all these aspects comprehensively, thus limiting model performance. Multi source event forecasting has proven promising but still suffers from several challenges, including 1) geographical hierarchies in multi-source data features, 2) missing values, and 3) characterization of structured feature sparsity. This paper proposes a novel feature learning model that concurrently addresses all the above challenges. Specifically, given multi-source data from different geographical levels, we design a new forecasting model by characterizing the lower-level features' dependence on higher-level features. To handle the correlations amidst structured feature sets and deal with missing values among the coupled features, we propose a novel feature learning model based on an $N$th-order strong hierarchy and fused-overlapping group Lasso. An efficient algorithm is developed to optimize model parameters and ensure global optima. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets in different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model.",2016,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining

Die Entwicklung der Aunjetitzer Keramik in Mitteldeutschland.,"E i n l e i t u n g .

Impact of intestinal worms on distal immune response and control of co-infections,"Parasitic worm infections have been suggested to impair control of secondary infections and vaccine efficacy. However, the experimental data regarding the capacity of intestinal nematodes to modulate host immune responses was lacking and the mechanism underlying dampened immune responses, particularly those distal to the gut, incompletely understood. In this thesis, we investigated the effect of the intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus on the immune response to BCG infection/immunization. We found that H. polygyrus infection impaired CD4 T cell priming in both spleen and in lymph node distal to the site of the worm infection and reduced the recall immune response, measured as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to PPD in the skin. Furthermore, products released by the worms such as the excretory-secretory products from H. polygyrus (HES), were found to dampen the expansion of mycobacteria-specific CD4 T cells both in vitro and when administered at the site of BCG injection. We found that dampened immune responses were not primarily due to dissemination of regulatory immune responses induced by the intestinal worm. If molecules released by the worms can disseminate and contribute to immune suppression at distal sites is however not clear. Importantly, we found that the lymph nodes (LNs) distal to the intestinal worm infection become atrophic and do not reach the same cellularity as worm-free mice upon subsequent BCG infection in the skin. In the smaller LN of worm-infected mice, all lymphocyte populations declined and the composition of lymphocyte subpopulations were found to be altered, seen as a decreased T/B lymphocyte ratio and increased CD4/CD8 T cell ratio. Underlying this phenomenon was the recruitment of lymphocytes to the draining mesenteric LN (mLN). In particular, large numbers of naÃ¯ve lymphocytes were trapped in the mLN during the chronic infection, which over time resulted in a re-distribution of the lymphocyte pool. De-worming was found to recover the cellularity of distal LN and in turn mend the response to BCG measured in the LN draining the site of injection. Collectively, our findings show that chronic nematode infection causes a paucity of lymphocytes in peripheral LN, which acts to impair the immune response capacity to the subsequent infection.

How powerful are summary-based methods for identifying expression-trait associations under different genetic architectures?,"Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have recently been employed as an approach that can draw upon the advantages of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression studies to identify genes associated with complex traits. Unlike standard GWAS, summary level data suffices for TWAS and offers improved statistical power. Two popular TWAS methods include either (a) imputing the cis genetic component of gene expression from smaller sized studies (using multi-SNP prediction or MP) into much larger effective sample sizes afforded by GWAS - TWAS-MP or (b) using summary-based Mendelian randomization - TWAS-SMR. Although these methods have been effective at detecting functional variants, it remains unclear how extensive variability in the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases impacts TWAS results. Our goal was to investigate the different scenarios under which these methods yielded enough power to detect significant expression-trait associations. In this study, we conducted extensive simulations based on 6000 randomly chosen, unrelated Caucasian males from Geisinger's MyCode population to compare the power to detect cis expression-trait associations (within 500 kb of a gene) using the above-described approaches. To test TWAS across varying genetic backgrounds we simulated gene expression and phenotype using different quantitative trait loci per gene and cis-expression /trait heritability under genetic models that differentiate the effect of causality from that of pleiotropy. For each gene, on a training set ranging from 100 to 1000 individuals, we either (a) estimated regression coefficients with gene expression as the response using five different methods: LASSO, elastic net, Bayesian LASSO, Bayesian spike-slab, and Bayesian ridge regression or (b) performed eQTL analysis. We then sampled with replacement 50,000, 150,000, and 300,000 individuals respectively from the testing set of the remaining 5000 individuals and conducted GWAS on each set. Subsequently, we integrated the GWAS summary statistics derived from the testing set with the weights (or eQTLs) derived from the training set to identify expression-trait associations using (a) TWAS-MP (b) TWAS-SMR (c) eQTL-based GWAS, or (d) standalone GWAS. Finally, we examined the power to detect functionally relevant genes using the different approaches under the considered simulation scenarios. In general, we observed great similarities among TWAS-MP methods although the Bayesian methods resulted in improved power in comparison to LASSO and elastic net as the trait architecture grew more complex while training sample sizes and expression heritability remained small. Finally, we observed high power under causality but very low to moderate power under pleiotropy.",2018,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing
Fish assemblages of Red Sea backreef biotopes,"1. 
Fish assemblages of shallow-lagoonal biotopes (seagrass beds, coral patches, reef flat and sand) were examined within the Nabq Managed Resource Protected Area (MRPA), South Sinai, Egypt. This protected area supports a small-scale artisanal Bedouin fishery, managed by gear restrictions and a network of no-take zones (NTZs). 
 
2. 
Coral patches showed highest species richness and diversity of fish, followed in order by the reef flat, shallow seagrass beds and sandy bottoms. 
 
3. 
There were clear differences in fish assemblages between the biotopes surveyed, little differences between sampling areas and no significant differences in fish assemblages between no-take and take zones, suggesting species characteristic of these shallow-water biotopes are dispersed along the coast irrespective of fishing pressure. 
 
4. 
Nine species (Acanthurus nigrofuscus, Asterropteryx semipunctatus, Cryptocentrus caeruleopunctatus, Cheilio inermis, Thalassoma rueppellii, Lethrinus mahsena, Lethrinus nebulosus, Parupeneus forsskali and Pomacentrus trilineatus) had a 95% correlation to the pattern of assemblage distribution, indicating these species are the most important determinants of the fish community. 
 
5. 
Approximately one-third of fishes recorded appeared to be juveniles, with seagrass beds having a particularly high proportion of juvenile fish, including several commercial species. 
 
6. 
The structure of the fish assemblage and fish size suggests that shallow-water biotopes in Nabq MRPA may be acting as nursery areas of commercial fish for the Bedouin fishery.

A Computed Tomography-Based Radiomic Prognostic Marker of Advanced High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Recurrence: A Multicenter Study,"Objectives: We used radiomic analysis to establish a radiomic signature based on preoperative contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) and explore its effectiveness as a novel recurrence risk prognostic marker for advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Methods: This study had a retrospective multicenter (two hospitals in China) design and a radiomic analysis was performed using contrast enhanced CT in advanced HGSOC (FIGO stage III or IV) patients. We used a minimum 18-month follow-up period for all patients (median 38.8 months, range 18.8-81.8 months). All patients were divided into three cohorts according to the timing of their surgery and hospital stay: training cohort (TC) and internal validation cohort (IVC) were from one hospital, and independent external validation cohort (IEVC) was from another hospital. A total of 620 3-D radiomic features were extracted and a Lasso-Cox regression was used for feature dimension reduction and determination of radiomic signature. Finally, we combined the radiomic signature with seven common clinical variables to develop a novel nomogram using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Results: A final 142 advanced HGSOC patients were enrolled. Patients were successfully divided into two groups with statistically significant differences based on radiomic signature, consisting of four radiomic features (log-rank test P = 0.001, <0.001, <0.001 for TC, IVC, and IEVC, respectively). The discrimination accuracies of radiomic signature for predicting recurrence risk within 18 months were 82.4% (95% CI, 77.8-87.0%), 77.3% (95% CI, 74.4-80.2%), and 79.7% (95% CI, 73.8-85.6%) for TC, IVC, and IEVC, respectively. Further, the discrimination accuracies of radiomic signature for predicting recurrence risk within 3 years were 83.4% (95% CI, 77.3-89.6%), 82.0% (95% CI, 78.9-85.1%), and 70.0% (95% CI, 63.6-76.4%) for TC, IVC, and IEVC, respectively. Finally, the accuracy of radiomic nomogram for predicting 18-month and 3-year recurrence risks were 84.1% (95% CI, 80.5-87.7%) and 88.9% (95% CI, 85.8-92.5%), respectively. Conclusions: Radiomic signature and radiomic nomogram may be low-cost, non-invasive means for successfully predicting risk for postoperative advanced HGSOC recurrence before or during the perioperative period. Radiomic signature is a potential prognostic marker that may allow for individualized evaluation of patients with advanced HGSOC.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Gravity-driven microfiltration pretreatment for reverse osmosis (RO) seawater desalination: Microbial community characterization and RO performance,"Abstract A pilot gravity-driven microfiltration (GDM) reactor was operated on-site for over 250Â days to pretreat seawater for reverse osmosis (RO) desalination. The microbial community analysis indicated that the dominant species in the pilot GDM system (~Â 18.6Â L/m 2 Â h) were completely different from those in the other tested GDM systems (~Â 2.7â€“17.2Â L/m 2 Â h), operating on the same feed. This was possibly due to the differences in available space for eukaryotic movement, hydraulic retention time (i.e., different organic loadings) or operation time (250Â days vs. 25â€“45Â days). Stichotrichia , Copepoda , and Pterygota were predominant eukaryotes at genus level in the pilot GDM. Furthermore, the GDM pretreatment led to a significantly lower RO fouling potential in comparison to the ultrafiltration (UF) system. This was attributed to the fact that GDM filtration produced a permeate with less amount of assimilable organic carbon (AOC) and biopolymers. Accordingly, lower amount of organic foulants (biopolymers and low molecular weight neutrals) and less biofilm formation on the GDM-RO membrane were observed. Although Î±-proteobacteria were dominant in both RO fouling layers, their bacterial community compositions at genus level were significantly different. Thalassobius had higher abundance in the GDM-RO fouling layers, while Erythrobacter and Hyphomonas were more predominant in the UF-RO fouling layers.",2017,Desalination
Aval Fonio. Improvement of post-harvest and enhancement of fonio in Africa: Annual report (january 2015 - june 2016),"The Aval Fonio project (AURG/161/2012), which was originally due to run until 16 December 2015, was extended by 6 months until 16 June 2016 (African Union addendum no.1 of 5 October 2015 changing the project term to 42 month). In 2015, the second annual meeting was held in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) from 19 to 23 January 2015. This meeting brought together ten or so participants from Mali, Senegal, Burundi France and naturally Burkina Faso. Only the IRAG researchers (Guinea) were unable to travel to the meeting. Then, from 8 to 12 June 2015, a work packages workshop bringing together twenty or so participants was held in Dakar (Senegal). In the first half of 2016, the third annual meeting was held in Dakar (Senegal) from 1 to 5 February 2016. This meeting brought in a dozen participants. In the end, the final meeting was held in Montpellier (France) from 6 to 10 June 2016, bringing together all the project partners except for Burundi. In 2015 and 2016, the WP1 activities in Guinea: â€œAnalysing production and post-harvest systemsâ€ initiated in 6 large villages in Fouta Djalon were extended to the areas of Lelouma and Mali, situated to the west and north of Labe. These prefectures were chosen since fonio cultivation is very frequent there, both in tapades and in outfields. For WP2 â€œMechanisation of post-harvest techniquesâ€, trial plots were planted at IRAG Bareng in July 2015. After modification, the fonio motor mower was tested in Guinea, but the results were dissatisfactory. Fonio threshing and cleaning tests were carried out by IRAG. The Ricefan thresher (Votex) purchased from IMAF in Bamako (Mali) was tested, but the results were mediocre. The new trials conducted with the reconditioned ASSI thresher confirmed the good results already obtained during the previous fonio projects. The cleaning trials with the rotary screen and winnowing channel also confirmed the good performances of this equipment. Regarding WP3 â€œImproving processing and stabilisation techniquesâ€, and activity 3 (mechanisation of washing and degritting), it was concluded that washing could be mechanised using a simple electrical â€œcement mixerâ€. For degritting, Cirad designed and built a first â€œhydroliftâ€ prototype degritter, which was assembled at the IMAF workshop before being installed on the premises of Ucodal in Bamako. The equipment has operated since summer 2015 under actual conditions of use with good performances: a throughput of 80 to 100 kg/h and a residual grit content in the grains down to 200 mg/kg or even less. In view of the good performances obtained, a series of 3 hydrolifts was made for field testing on the premises of SMEs in Bamako (Mali), Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) and Kedougou (Senegal). Regarding activity 4 â€œdryingâ€, a cross-flow dryer (CSec-T) and a â€œgreenhouseâ€ dryer (CSec-S) were fitted with instrumentation and tested in early 2015 on the ESP-UCAD site in Dakar. Then in late 2015, these dryers were transferred to the field: a CSec-S greenhouse dryer at the Koba Club group (Kedougou), and a CSec-T cross-flow dryer to the Salemata group (eastern Senegal). For WP4 â€œInnovation process in small processing plantsâ€, the work conducted during the latter phase of the project furthered knowledge of the key players and stakeholders in the fonio industry innovation system in Burkina Faso and Mali. The â€œGMBF fonio hullerâ€ innovation case study reveals significant impacts on all the industry players, and primarily on the women processors and the producers. In Burkina Faso, a multiplayer innovation platform system to support the dissemination of the â€œHydroliftâ€ and â€œCSec-Tâ€ dryer innovations was set up in 2015 in Bobo Dioulasso. The company SOLDEV, a major player on this platform as an equipment manufacturer, has already manufactured and sold 5 dryers for women fonio processors in Ouagadougou, Bobo Dioulasso and Banfora. For WP5, the Coordinators organised the various researchers' workshops and the annual meetings of the Steering Committee, especially in January 2015 in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), in June 2015 and February 2016 in Dakar (Senegal), and finally in June 2016 in Montpellier (France). The project website (http://avalfonio. cirad.fr/en) has been regularly updated. The coordination also published the book â€œFonio, an African cerealâ€ (Cirad â€“IRAG Edition) and produced a short documentary film titled â€œfonioâ€. (Resume d'auteur)",2016,
Classification With the Sparse Group Lasso,"Classification with a sparsity constraint on the solution plays a central role in many high dimensional signal processing applications. In some cases, the features can be grouped together, so that entire subsets of features can be selected or discarded. In many applications, however, this can be too restrictive. In this paper, we are interested in a less restrictive form of structured sparse feature selection: We assume that while features can be grouped according to some notion of similarity, not all features in a group need be selected for the task at hand. The Sparse Group Lasso (SGL) was proposed to solve problems of this form. The main contributions of this paper are a new procedure called Sparse Overlapping Group (SOG) lasso, an extension to the SGL to overlapping groups and theoretical sample complexity bounds for the same. We establish model selection error bounds that specializes to many other cases. We experimentally validate our proposed method on both real and toy datasets.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
A Spatial-Temporal QoS Prediction Approach for Time-aware Web Service Recommendation,"Due to the popularity of service-oriented architectures for various distributed systems, an increasing number of Web services have been deployed all over the world. Recently, Web service recommendation became a hot research topic, one that aims to accurately predict the quality of functional satisfactory services for each end user. Generally, the performance of Web service changes over time due to variations of service status and network conditions. Instead of employing the conventional temporal models, we propose a novel spatial-temporal QoS prediction approach for time-aware Web service recommendation, where a sparse representation is employed to model QoS variations. Specifically, we make a zero-mean Laplace prior distribution assumption on the residuals of the QoS prediction, which corresponds to a Lasso regression problem. To effectively select the nearest neighbor for the sparse representation of temporal QoS values, the geo-location of web service is employed to reduce searching range while improving prediction accuracy. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-art methods with more than 10% improvement on the accuracy of temporal QoS prediction for time-aware Web service recommendation.",2016,TWEB
Convex optimization for joint zero-forcing and antenna selection in multiuser MISO systems,"The problem of joint zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming (BF) together with optimal power allocation (PA) and antenna selection (AS) for throughput maximization is considered in this paper for multi-user multiple input single output (MU-MISO) systems. We introduce a new formulation for the joint ZF and PA problem by adapting the algebraic subspace approach which finds a proper set for the optimization variable that inherently satisfies the ZF constraints. Also, the squared group Lasso penalty on the BF matrix is used to linearize (relax) the non-convex, NP-hard problem of joint BF and AS. Extensive simulations show that for the throughput problem, the proposed algorithm performs very closely to the optimal (exhaustive search) joint approach.",2014,2014 IEEE 15th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)
"Thalassospira tepidiphila sp. nov., a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium isolated from seawater.","A Gram-negative, mesophilic bacterial strain, designated 1-1B(T), which degrades polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, was isolated from petroleum-contaminated seawater during a bioremediation experiment. A 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the isolate was affiliated with the genus Thalassospira in the Alphaproteobacteria; the sequence was found to be most similar to those of Thalassospira profundimaris WP0211(T) (99.8 %), Thalassospira xiamenensis M-5(T) (98.2 %) and Thalassospira lucentensis DSM 14000(T) (98.1 %). However, the levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain 1-1B(T) and these type strains were 50.7+/-17.2, 35.7+/-17.8 and 32.0+/-21.1 %, respectively. In addition, strain 1-1B(T) was found to be distinct from the other described species of the genus Thalassospira in terms of some taxonomically important traits, including DNA G+C content, optimum growth temperature, salinity tolerance, utilization of carbon sources and fatty acid composition. Furthermore, strain 1-1B(T) and T. profundimaris were also different with regard to motility and denitrification capacities. On the basis of physiological and DNA-DNA hybridization data, strain 1-1B(T) represents a novel species within the genus Thalassospira, for which the name Thalassospira tepidiphila sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 1-1B(T) (=JCM 14578(T) =DSM 18888(T)).",2008,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Formin conformations during processive actin elongation,"Formins are a class of actin binding proteins that regulate the elongation and nucleation of actin filaments and they are key to maintaining cellular morphology. The mammalian formin-like 3 (FMNL3) protein is essential for the formation of filopodia, projections of the plasma membrane that enable cell motility. Formins contain a highly conserved formin homology 2 (FH2) domain that dimerizes through interactions of the lasso and post subdomains. These dimers bind to actin filament barbed ends to mediate elongation and prevent inhibition of filament growth by capping proteins, thereby ensuring the formation of long, linear actin filaments. The FH2 dimer is able to remain associated with the growing end of the filament during elongation through the flexibility of linker regions that connect the FH2 subunits. A previous structural study of the yeast formin Bni1p FH2 domain was found to form a complex with three adjacent actin subunits, supporting a simple stepping model of formin-mediated actin polymerization...",2015,The FASEB Journal
Sparse Sliced Inverse Quantile Regression,"The current paper proposes the sliced inverse quantile regression method (SIQR). In addition to the latter this study proposes both the sparse sliced inverse quantile regression method with Lasso (LSIQR) and Adaptive Lasso (ALSIQR) penalties. This article introduces a comprehensive study of SIQR and sparse SIQR. The simulation and real data analysis have been employed to check the performance of the SIQR, LSIQR and ALSIQR. According to the results of median of mean squared error and the absolute correlation criteria, we can conclude that the SIQR, LSIQR and ALSIQR are the more advantageous approaches in practice.",2016,Journal of Mathematics and Statistics
"Chemistry of Fe-Ti oxide minerals in the Hobenzan granitic complex, SW Japan: Subsolidus reduction in relation to base metal mineralization","SummaryThe mineralized stock of the Hobenzan granitic complex is composed of tonalite and a continuous differentiation series of biotite-hornblende granodiorite, hornblende biotite granite and biotite granite. Texture and mineral chemistry of the Fe-Ti oxide minerals in the Hobenzan granitic complex exhibit two different processes of magma evolution: one is an oxyexsolution process related to the magmatic and high temperature subsolidus stage, and the other is a reduction process of consecutive subsolidus stage. Rocks distributed in the northern part of the granitic complex preserve well the oxyexsolution process and show higher magnetic susceptibility, whereas those in the southern part of the complex, record the reduction process and show lower magnetic susceptibility.The magnetite-ilmenite geothermometer indicates temperatures of ca. 730Â°C for the oxide pairs of the early stage. Oxygen fugacity of one to three orders of magnitude higher than the annite-sanidine-magnetite (ASM) univariant curve, and an aqueous sulfur composition,fSO2/fH2S, of around 1.0 is indicated. This first stage corresponds to the crystallization of phenocrystic hornblende and plagioclase at depth. At about 700Â°C crystallization changed to biotite, K-feldspar and quartz, and continued to about 600Â°C. ThefO2 during this second stage is buffered by the ASM assemblage. This second stage defines the oxyexsolution process. Below about 600Â°C, a reduction process, caused by assimilation of carbonaceous matter of country rocks, overprinted the southern part of the complex. Oxide pairs show that thefO2 is about four orders of magnitude lower than the ASM univariant curve, andfSO2/fH2S is 10âˆ’8.0 or less at 550Â°C for this reduced assemblage. The drastic change in composition of sulfur-bearing aqueous species may be one of the principal factors allowing base metal mineralization.ZusammenfassungDer mineralisierte Hobenzan Granitkomplex setzt sich aus Tonaliten und einer kontinuierlichen Differentiationsserie, bestehend aus Biotit-Hornblende-Granodioriten, Hornblende-Biotit-Graniten und Biotit-Graniten, zusammen. Die Texturen und die Mineralchemie der Fe-Ti Oxide belegen zwei unterschiedliche Prozesse bei der Entwicklung des Hobenzan Granitkomplexes: einerseits einen Oxyexsolution-ProzeÃŸ, wÃ¤hrend des magmatischen und hochtemperierten Subsolidus-Stadiums, andererseits einen ReduktionsprozeÃŸ wÃ¤hrend des tiefertemperierten Subsolidus-Stadiums. Gesteine im nÃ¶rdlichen Hobenzan Komplex belegen vor allem den Oxyexsolution ProzeÃŸ und zeigen hÃ¶here magnetische SuszeptibilitÃ¤t, wÃ¤hrend jene im sÃ¼dlichen Teil den ReduktionsprozeÃŸ widerspiegeln und niedrigere magnetische SuszeptibilitÃ¤t zeigen.Das Magnetit-Ilmenit Geothermometer ergab Temperaturen von ca. 730Â°C fÃ¼r Oxidpaare des FrÃ¼hstadiums.

Dieses FrÃ¼hstadium korrespondiert mit der Kristallisation von Horblende und Plagioklas im Magma in grÃ¶ÃŸerer Tiefe. Ab ca. 700Â°C erfolgt die Kristallisation von Biotit, Alkalifeldspat und Quarz bis etwa 600Â°C, wobeifO2 durch die ASM Mineralassoziation gepuffert wird. Dieses zweite Stadium wird als Oxyexsolution ProzeÃŸ beschrieben. Unter 600Â°C erfolgte eine Reduktion durch Assimilation von kohlenstoffreichem Material vor allem im sÃ¼dlichen Teil des Komplexes. Oxidpaare dieses Stadiums belegen, daÃŸfO2 um etwa vier GrÃ¶ÃŸenordnungen unterhalb des ASM Puffers liegt, undfSO2/fH2S ist â©½ 10âˆ’8 bei 550Â°C.

Granger causality between cortical regions from voxelwise f MRI BOLD signals with LASSO,"Functional brain network studies using the Blood Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) signal from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) are becoming increasingly prevalent in research on the neural basis of human cognition. An important problem in functional brain network analysis is to understand directed functional interactions between brain regions during cognitive performance. This problem has important implications for understanding top-down influences from frontal and parietal control regions to visual occipital cortex in visuospatial attention, the goal motivating the present study. A common approach to measuring directed functional interactions between two brain regions is to first create nodal signals by averaging the BOLD signals of all the voxels in each region, and to then measure directed functional interactions between the nodal signals. Another approach, that avoids averaging, is to measure directed functional interactions between all pairwise combinations of voxels in the two regions. Here we employ an alternative approach that avoids the drawbacks of both averaging and pairwise voxel measures. In this approach, we first use the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO) to pre-select voxels for analysis, then compute a Multivariate Vector AutoRegressive (MVAR) model from the time series of the selected voxels, and finally compute summary Granger Causality (GC) statistics from the model to represent directed interregional interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on both simulated and empirical fMRI data. We also show that averaging regional BOLD activity to create a nodal signal may lead to biased GC estimation of directed interregional interactions. The approach presented here makes it feasible to compute GC between brain regions without the need for averaging. Our results suggest that in the analysis of functional brain networks, careful consideration must be given to the way that network nodes and edges are defined because those definitions may have important implications for the validity of the analysis.

Application of Bayesian Hierarchical Models in Genetic Data Analysis,"Genetic data analysis has been capturing a lot of attentions for understanding the mechanism of the development and progressing of diseases like cancers, and is crucial in discovering genetic markers and treatment targets in medical research. This dissertation focuses on several important issues in genetic data analysis, graphical network modeling, feature selection, and covariance estimation. First, we develop a gene network modeling method for discrete gene expression data, produced by technologies such as serial analysis of gene expression and RNA sequencing experiment, which generate counts of mRNA transcripts in cell samples. We propose a generalized linear model to fit the discrete gene expression data and assume that the log ratios of the mean expression levels follow a Gaussian distribution. We derive the gene network structures by selecting covariance matrices of the Gaussian distribution with a hyper-inverse Wishart prior. We incorporate prior network models based on Gene Ontology information, which avails existing biological information on the genes of interest. Next, we consider a variable selection problem, where the variables have natural grouping structures, with application to analysis of chromosomal copy number data. The chromosomal copy number data are produced by molecular inversion probes experiments which measure probe-specific copy number changes. We propose a novel Bayesian variable selection method, the hierarchical structured variable selection (HSVS) method, which accounts for the natural gene and probe-within-gene architecture to identify important genes and probes associated with clinically relevant outcomes. We propose the HSVS model for grouped variable selection, where simultaneous selection of both groups and within-group variables is of interest. The HSVS model utilizes a discrete mixture prior distribution for group selection and group-specific Bayesian lasso hierarchies for variable selection within groups. We further provide methods for accounting for serial correlations within groups that incorporate Bayesian fused lasso methods for within-group selection. Finally, we",2012,
"Late Triassic (Carnian - Rhaetian) palynology of Hopen, Svalbard","Abstract Triassic strata crop out extensively on the Svalbard Archipelago and subcrop under much of the Barents Sea. However, due to the remoteness of the region, relatively few palynostratigraphic studies of the Upper Triassic succession have been conducted. Consequently, existing palynological zonations for the Late Triassic in the region are of relatively low temporal resolution. In this study, 154 palynological samples from eight outcrop localities on the island of Hopen, Svalbard Archipelago, were analysed. Hopen offers unique insights into the subsea geology of the Barents Sea due to its position as the most southeasterly island of the archipelago. Samples spanning the De Geerdalen, Flatsalen and Svenskoya formations (Kapp Toscana Group) yielded well preserved palynofloras. The dense vertical and lateral distribution of samples makes this the most detailed palynological investigation of LateTriassic strata conducted thus far in the region. Six palynological assemblages were recognised using relative abundance and first stratigraphic appearance data; in ascending stratigraphic order these are the: (1)Leschikisporis aduncus assemblage (late Carnian), (2)Protodiploxypinus spp. assemblage (late Carnianâ€“ ? early Norian), (3)Classopollis torosus assemblage (early Norian), (4)Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica assemblage (early Norian), (5)Limbosporites lundbladiiâ€“ Quadraeculina anellaeformis assemblage (? late Norianâ€“? Rhaetian) and the (6)Rogalskaisporites ambientis assemblage (? late Rhaetian). The palynological assemblages are compared to previous palynological studies on the island and to existing palynozonations for the region. A revised age interpretation for Hopen is provided based on the integration of palynology and independent chrono- and biostratigraphic evidence. The youngest strata are interpreted to be of Rhaetian age and yielded palynomorph assemblages remarkably similar to contemporaneous assemblages previously described from China, Australia and New Zealand. The study contributes important empirical data concerning the Late Triassic palynofloras along the northern shores of Pangaea.",2015,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
Istanbul - Venice Convergence from Gentile Bellini to Bienalles,"The history of Venice & Istanbul convergence in visual arts goes back a long way. The portrait (in oil painting) of Fatih The Conquerer who signed the peace treaty in Venice in 1479 by Gentile Bellini which is exhibited at London National Gallery today is one of the predominant examples of the said convergence. The Ottoman Empire which maintained its business connections and cultural relations with Italy throughout the history always left the door open for its visitors composed of musicians, painters, architects and sculptors. For example; Giuseppe Donizetti who was invited as the Conductor of Empire by Mahmut the 2nd in 1827 was awarded the title of â€œPashaâ€ by winning the palaceâ€™s affection. Nevertheless, Adolphe Thalasso who is famous with his researches on the Ottoman art of painting and theatre and is of Venetian origin and born in Ä°stanbul; Fausto Zonaro who is the court painter; Giulio Mongeri who is an architect; Gaspare Fossati; Pietro Canonica who is a sculptor are some of the Italian visitors of the Ottoman. The said ongoing relations during the Ottoman period change their course by the Turkish artists participating in the modern art activities held in Italy during the Republican period. Turkey who participated in the Venice Bienalle in 1954 for the first time would participate in the activities again in the 1990s. The Venice Bienalle adventure of Turkey who has been represented by the artists such as Kutlug Ataman, HÃ¼seyin Caglayan, BÃ¼lent Sangar and etc. in recent years is not limited with the said activities. The Istanbul Bienalle which became one of the important brands of Turkey in the field of art would take the Venice Bienalle as Her model when She organized the Ä°stanbul Bienalle for the first time in 1987 and would establish Her own style in the next periods. The activity of â€œAn Anthology from Venice & Istanbul : 51st International Venice Bienalleâ€ which is held in 2006 at Istanbul Modern under the curatorship of Rosa Martinez; the â€œSultans in Veniceâ€ exhibition of Ismail Acar, the painter, which is held synchronously with the Venice Bienalle are the significant artistic events bringing the journey of art between the said two cities into view in different perspectives and such examples may be increased. In the text; artistic convergences between Venice & Istanbul has been considered in historical aspects and within the scope of current activities of art.The aim is to provide a basis for contributing to the different debates on the subject.",2017,The Journal of International Social Research
Asymptotic properties of adaptive group Lasso for sparse reduced rank regression,"This paper studies the asymptotic properties of the penalized least squares estimator using an adaptive group Lasso penalty for the reduced rank regression. The group Lasso penalty is defined in the way that the regression coefficients corresponding to each predictor are treated as one group. It is shown that under certain regularity conditions, the estimator can achieve the minimax optimal rate of convergence. Moreover, the variable selection consistency can also be achieved, that is, the relevant predictors can be identified with probability approaching one. In the asymptotic theory, the number of response variables, the number of predictors, and the rank number are allowed to grow to infinity with the sample size.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory
A comparative analysis of methods for predicting clinical outcomes using high-dimensional genomic datasets.,"OBJECTIVE
The objective of this investigation is to evaluate binary prediction methods for predicting disease status using high-dimensional genomic data. The central hypothesis is that the Bayesian network (BN)-based method called efficient Bayesian multivariate classifier (EBMC) will do well at this task because EBMC builds on BN-based methods that have performed well at learning epistatic interactions.


METHOD
We evaluate how well eight methods perform binary prediction using high-dimensional discrete genomic datasets containing epistatic interactions. The methods are as follows: naive Bayes (NB), model averaging NB (MANB), feature selection NB (FSNB), EBMC, logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), Lasso, and extreme learning machines (ELM). We use a hundred 1000-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) simulated datasets, ten 10,000-SNP datasets, six semi-synthetic sets, and two real genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets in our evaluation.


RESULTS
In fivefold cross-validation studies, the SVM performed best on the 1000-SNP dataset, while the BN-based methods performed best on the other datasets, with EBMC exhibiting the best overall performance. In-sample testing indicates that LR, SVM, Lasso, ELM, and NB tend to overfit the data.


DISCUSSION
EBMC performed better than NB when there are several strong predictors, whereas NB performed better when there are many weak predictors. Furthermore, for all BN-based methods, prediction capability did not degrade as the dimension increased.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results support the hypothesis that EBMC performs well at binary outcome prediction using high-dimensional discrete datasets containing epistatic-like interactions. Future research using more GWAS datasets is needed to further investigate the potential of EBMC.",2014,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA

Identification of Biomarkers for Predicting the Overall Survival of Ovarian Cancer Patients: a Sparse Group Lasso Approach,"Next-generation sequencing has been routinely applied to cancer biology, making it possible for researchers to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer initiation and progression. However, how to identify oncomarkers from massive complex genomic data poses a great challenge for both modeling and computing. In this paper, we propose a novel computational pipeline to identify genes related to the overall survival of ovarian cancer patients from the rich Cancer Genome Atlas data. Different from the existing studies, we incorporate dependence structure among genes and pathway information into the variable selection. Firstly, the dimensionality of the ovarian cancer data is reduced by a novel stepwise feature screening which mimics the hierarchy of the underlying causal network. The second step of the pipeline is to divide genes into clusters with distinct cellular functions by k-means, x-means and PAMSAM learning algorithms. In the final step, we fit a cox proportional hazard model with a sparse group lasso penalty for further variable selection. Of the 115 genes in the final list, many were reported to be associated with cancer initiation or progression in the literature. In addition, we find several gene families including the NEK family and RNF family, which are closely associated with the survival of ovarian cancer patients.",2016,International Journal of Statistics and Probability

An Improving Framework of regularization for Network Compression,"Deep Neural Networks have achieved remarkable success relying on the developing high computation capability of GPUs and large-scale datasets with increasing network depth and width in image recognition, object detection and many other applications. However, due to the expensive computation and intensive memory, researchers have concentrated on designing compression methods in recent years. In this paper, we briefly summarize the existing advanced techniques that are useful in model compression at first. After that, we give a detailed description on group lasso regularization and its variants. More importantly, we propose an improving framework of partial regularization based on the relationship between neurons and connections of adjacent layers. It is reasonable and feasible with the help of permutation property of neural network . Experiment results show that partial regularization methods brings improvements such as higher classification accuracy in both training and testing stages on multiple datasets. Since our regularizers contain the computation of less parameters, it shows competitive performances in terms of the total running time of experiments. Finally, we analysed the results and draw a conclusion that the optimal network structure must exist and depend on the input data.",2019,ArXiv
Sparsity with sign-coherent groups of variables via the cooperative-Lasso,"We consider the problems of estimation and selection of parameters endowed with a known group structure, when the groups are assumed to be sign-coherent, that is, gathering either nonnegative, nonpositive or null parameters. To tackle this problem, we propose the cooperative-Lasso penalty. We derive the optimality conditions defining the cooperative-Lasso estimate for generalized linear models, and propose an efficient active set algorithm suited to high-dimensional problems. We study the asymptotic consistency of the estimator in the linear regression setup and derive its irrepresentable conditions, which are milder than the ones of the group-Lasso regarding the matching of groups with the sparsity pattern of the true parameters. We also address the problem of model selection in linear regression by deriving an approximation of the degrees of freedom of the cooperative-Lasso estimator. Simulations comparing the proposed estimator to the group and sparse group-Lasso comply with our theoretical results, showing consistent improvements in support recovery for sign-coherent groups. We finally propose two examples illustrating the wide applicability of the cooperative-Lasso: first to the processing of ordinal variables, where the penalty acts as a monotonicity prior; second to the processing of genomic data, where the set of differentially expressed probes is enriched by incorporating all the probes of the microarray that are related to the corresponding genes.",2012,The Annals of Applied Statistics
Machine learning of human plasma lipidomes for obesity estimation in a large population cohort,"Obesity is associated with changes in the plasma lipids. Although simple lipid quantification is routinely used, plasma lipids are rarely investigated at the level of individual molecules. We aimed at predicting different measures of obesity based on the plasma lipidome in a large population cohort using advanced machine learning modeling. A total of 1,061 participants of the FINRISK 2012 population cohort were randomly chosen, and the levels of 183 plasma lipid species were measured in a novel mass spectrometric shotgun approach. Multiple machine intelligence models were trained to predict obesity estimates, i.e., body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage (BFP), and validated in 250 randomly chosen participants of the MalmÃ¶ Diet and Cancer Cardiovascular Cohort (MDC-CC). Comparison of the different models revealed that the lipidome predicted BFP the best (R2 = 0.73), based on a Lasso model. In this model, the strongest positive and the strongest negative predictor were sphingomyelin molecules, which differ by only 1 double bond, implying the involvement of an unknown desaturase in obesity-related aberrations of lipid metabolism. Moreover, we used this regression to probe the clinically relevant information contained in the plasma lipidome and found that the plasma lipidome also contains information about body fat distribution, because WHR (R2 = 0.65) was predicted more accurately than BMI (R2 = 0.47). These modeling results required full resolution of the lipidome to lipid species level, and the predicting set of biomarkers had to be sufficiently large. The power of the lipidomics association was demonstrated by the finding that the addition of routine clinical laboratory variables, e.g., high-density lipoprotein (HDL)- or low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- cholesterol did not improve the model further. Correlation analyses of the individual lipid species, controlled for age and separated by sex, underscores the multiparametric and lipid species-specific nature of the correlation with the BFP. Lipidomic measurements in combination with machine intelligence modeling contain rich information about body fat amount and distribution beyond traditional clinical assays.",2019,PLoS Biology

We compare the hybrid method with other algorithms and show a higher discriminative performance. The developed deep learning pipeline can easily be expanded to cover more advanced network structures and hybrids. We aim to evaluate the deep learning methods on more cohorts at risk and outcomes in multiple databases in the near future. Introduction The success of machine learning largely depends on the selection of an optimal feature representation. In the early days, the machine learning community mainly focused on algorithm development, while currently the field is shifting to more powerful feature engineering. Deep learning models are widely used to automatically learn highlevel features from both temporal and static raw data, and have achieved remarkable results in image processing and speech recognition [1,2]. Recently, interesting results have been shown in healthcare applications [3-5]. The applied model architectures are composed of multiple non-linear neural networks, e.g. convolutional neural network. However, these methods have not been assessed at large scale, i.e. many cohorts at risk and many outcomes on EHR data. This would require a systematic approach against a common data model. We believe, the Observational Health Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative is in the best position to expand the insights of the global machine learning community in the use of deep learning for patient-level predictive modelling. Methods and Results We implemented different several deep learning models in the PatientLevelPrediction Package using PyTorch (http://pytorch.org ), e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The framework can easily be extended with more advanced network structures. As a proof-ofconcept, we demonstrate the use of the deep learning implementation for predicting hypertensive disorder in patients with pharmaceutically treated depression in the Integrate Primary Care Information (IPCI) GP database. The target population consists of n=133,349 patients with pharmaceutically treated depression (PTD) without a history of psychosis, mania, or dementia. In total 3,894 PTD patients developed a hypertensive disorder. We used a backward observation window of 365 days and a time at risk window of 365 days following the start of the cohort. In this study, we only considered measurement as temporal data and other patient information (procedures, drugs, conditions, observation and demographic data) are treated as non-temporal data. In total 224 types of measurements and 5648 types of other non-temporal data where used as candidate predictors. The temporal data, i.e. the measurements, are fed into the CNN, wherein we employ a similar CNN architecture as used by Razavian et al. [3], i.e. two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers, the dropout probability between each layer is 0.5. The non-temporal data, i.e. all except for the measurements, are fed into the a MLP with one hidden layer. The final prediction is averaging the output probabilities from the two individual models. We use a weighted loss function to overcome the class imbalance problem when training the model using Adam with regularization [6]. We compared the performance with Lasso as implemented in R (Cyclops) using only measurements and Lasso using the full feature set, CNN using only measurements, logistics regression (LR) and MLP as implemented in PyTorch on the full features set, and a hybrid of CNN and MLP/LR.

"A Comparative Study of Paleogene Lacustrine Microfossils among Pearl River Mouth Basin, Beibuwan Basin and Bohai Gulf Basin","Microfossils from Paleogene lacustrine oil source rocks of the Pearl River Mouth Basin, Beibuwan Basin and Bohai Gulf Basin have been studied. The Paleogene lacustrine microfossils of Bohai Gulf Basin are characterized by their high abundances, high diversities, high proportion of local species as well as saline species and the occurrence of talassogenous fauna. In Beibuwan Basin, only ostracods,gastropods and charophytes are discovered in the Weizhou Formation and Liushagang Formation; microfossils are rare in the Paleogene lacustrine sediments and only shell debris were found in some samples. According to the characteristics of microfossils of the three basins, we speculated that the Bohai Gulf Basin was a hydrologically closed lake during Paleogene and in some periods it was a saline lake rich in Na and Cl. The Paleogene lacustrine oil source rocks of Pear River Mouth Basin were deposited in a freshwater lake with lower salinity, hardness and pH. The Paleogene lake of Beibuwan Basin was a freshwater lake too, but with higher salinity.",2002,
ThermoEPred-EL: Robust bandgap predictions of chalcogenides with diamond-like structure via feature cross-based stacked ensemble learning,"Abstract Implementation on rapid and accurate bandgap prediction has great practical implications for a range of applications. While quantum mechanical computations are enormously computation-time intensive, using informatics-based statistical learning approaches can be a promising alternative due to its availability, power and relatively limited cost of high-performance computational equipment. Here we demonstrate a systematic ensemble learning model which integrates a novel feature-engineering approach and a robust learning framework for predicting bandgaps of one series of typical thermoelectric materials: chalcogenides with diamond-like structure. After combining a feature crossing technique with a feature selection method, the proposed optimal descriptor set is identified by searching the feature space of 23,454 descriptors stemmed from the elemental features. Stable statistic-based feature selection methods are applied to identify the most crucial and relevant descriptors.Â The stacked ensemble learning model, which integrates the advantages of three different level-0 models (LASSO, SVR, and AdaBoost) and one level-1 model (GBDT), obtains 90.48% prediction accuracy, thus improving model accuracy and robustness. The results demonstrate the interpretability and generalizability of the stacked ensemble model, which can be applied to bandgap predictions in other material systems, thereby accelerating the design and optimization process for discovering new functional materials.",2019,Computational Materials Science
Medium effects in the nuclear Landau-Vlassov transport theory.,"With the assumption that the Brueckner g matrix provides the suitable renormalization of the nucleon-nucleon interaction due to medium effects in the collision term of the nuclear Landau-Vlassov equation, we use the results of our Brueckner calculation for nuclear matter at finite temperature to evaluate the renormalization factor in a local and thermal approximation.",1987,"Physical review.

Spontaneous discontinuation of distressing auditory verbal hallucinations in a school-based sample of adolescents: a longitudinal study,"Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) can be transiently present in both clinical and healthy adolescent populations. It is not yet fully understood why AVH discontinue in some adolescents and persist in others. The aim of this explorative study is to investigate predictors of spontaneous discontinuation of distressing AVH in a school-based sample of adolescents. 1841 adolescents (mean age 12.4 years, 58% female) completed self-report questionnaires at baseline. The current study included 123 adolescents (7%; 63% female) who reported at least mild distressing AVH at baseline and completed follow-up measurements. LASSO analyses were used to uncover predictors of spontaneous discontinuation of distressing AVH. During follow-up, 43 adolescents (35%) reported having experienced distressing AVH during the last 12 months, while 80 adolescents did not. Spontaneous discontinuation of distressing AVH was predicted by never having used cannabis, parents not being divorced in the past year, never having been scared by seeing a deceased body, less prosocial behaviour, school grade repetition, having the feeling that others have it in for you, having anxiety when meeting new people, having lived through events exactly as if they happened before and having the feeling as if parts of the body have changed. No associations between spontaneous discontinuation of distressing AVH and age or ethnicity were found. Distressing AVH in non-clinical adolescents are mostly transient. Discontinuation was predicted up to a certain extent. However, several predictors were difficult to interpret and do not provide leads for preventive measures, except for discouraging cannabis use.",2019,European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry

A Two-Stage Penalized Logistic Regression Approach to Case-Control Genome-Wide Association Studies,"We propose a two-stage penalized logistic regression approach to case-control genome-wide association studies. This approach consists of a screening stage and a selection stage. In the screening stage, main-effect and interaction-effect features are screened by using ð¿1-penalized logistic like-lihoods. In the selection stage, the retained features are ranked by the logistic likelihood with the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty (Fan and Li, 2001) and Jeffreyâ€™s Prior penalty (Firth, 1993), a sequence of nested candidate models are formed, and the models are assessed by a family of extended Bayesian information criteria (J. Chen and Z. Chen, 2008). The proposed approach is applied to the analysis of the prostate cancer data of the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project in the National Cancer Institute, USA. Simulation studies are carried out to compare the approach with the pair-wise multiple testing approach (Marchini et al. 2005) and the LASSO-patternsearch algorithm (Shi et al. 2007).",2012,Journal of Probability and Statistics
Exploring elastic net and multivariate regression,"When it comes to datasets with a tremendous amount of predictors, variable reduction techniques such as PCA or FA are often used. In this paper, the elastic net, which lies in between the LASSO method and ridge regression, is used as a variable reduction technique followed by further analysis with multivariate regression. Specifically, a messy only dataset is used to show how it can be 'tidied' up and broken down into sensible subsets using the aforementioned method.",2016,arXiv: Methodology
"Color as related to Size, Sex, and Behavior in seven Caribbean Labrid Fish Species (genera Thalassoma, Halichoeres and Hemipteronotus)","Approximately 5500 Caribbean labrid fishes belonging to seven species were caught, transported, partly on ice, to the laboratory and subsequently studied. The major portion was examined immediately; some 20 per cent were stored briefly (less than three days) at minus 20Â°C. Color pattern (and shape of fins) may change during adult life, varying from slightly Halichoeres poeyi) to drastically Thalassoma bifasciatum). Per species a classification into successive color phases has been introduced; these color phases are strongly related to body length. In Halichoeres maculipinna, Hemipteronotus splendens and Hemipteronotus martinicensis females are restricted to the small, first adult color phase; males have exclusively been found in the larger intermediate and terminal color phases. This confirms the prevailing opinion that labrid dichromatism represents a sexual dimorphism. In Halichoeres poeyi females are also significantly smaller than males. In the most abundant species, however, sex and color/size are not clearly related. In Thalassoma bifasciatum and Halichoeres bivittatus two types of males occur, as functional males are present in both the small, first adult color phase and in the large, terminal color phase. Functional females have been found in all sizes and colors in Halichoeres bivittatus and Halichoeres garnoti. Sex reversal from female towards male sex â€“ a common process in all species â€“ occurs more or less coincidental to color change. As distinct from the Sparidae, Scaridae or Serranidae the reversal proceeds via a total decline of the transforming ovary. Consequently, temporary stages of functional hermaphroditism do not occur in Labridae.",1972,Studies on the Fauna of CuraÃ§ao and other Caribbean Islands
Stochastic Discrete First-order Algorithm for Feature Subset Selection,"This paper addresses the problem of selecting a significant subset of candidate features to use for multiple linear regression. Bertsimas et al. [5] recently proposed the discrete first-order (DFO) algorithm to efficiently find near-optimal solutions to this problem. However, this algorithm is unable to escape from locally optimal solutions. To resolve this, we propose a stochastic discrete first-order (SDFO) algorithm for feature subset selection. In this algorithm, random perturbations are added to a sequence of candidate solutions as a means to escape from locally optimal solutions, which broadens the range of discoverable solutions. Moreover, we derive the optimal step size in the gradient-descent direction to accelerate convergence of the algorithm. We also make effective use of the L2-regularization term to improve the predictive performance of a resultant subset regression model. The simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms the original DFO algorithm. Our algorithm was superior in predictive performance to lasso and forward stepwise selection as well. key words: feature subset selection, optimization algorithm, linear regression, machine learning, statistics",2019,
UnlÃ¶sliche Restfilme der stationÃ¤ren FlÃ¼ssigkeit in gas-chromatographischen Glaskapillaren,"SummaryA residual tenaciously held layer of the chromatographic stationary liquid remains on the walls of coated opentubular columns even after exhaustive washing with organic solvents and alters the surface properties of the glass. The resulting sorption character of the surface depends on the type of glass, on the stationary liquid originally used and on its thermal pretreatment in the column; in all cases, a decreased adsorption activity â€”compared with that of clean glass â€” is observed. The consequences of this effect are discussed. In certain cases, interesting and practically usable separations can be obtained with capillaries containing only the residual film or with such columns, where this film has served as the basis for another coating, performed with a different stationary phase.ZusammenfassungAuf der Innenwand von Glaskapillaren, die mit einer stationÃ¤ren chromatographischen FlÃ¼ssigkeit imprÃ¤gniert wurden, bleibt auch nach intensivem Auswaschen mit organischen LÃ¶semitteln ein geringer fest haftender Anteil, der die OberflÃ¤cheneigenschaften des Glases Ã¤ndert.

Latent Variable Time-varying Network Inference,"In many applications of finance, biology and sociology, complex systems involve entities interacting with each other. These processes have the peculiarity of evolving over time and of comprising latent factors, which influence the system without being explicitly measured. In this work we present latent variable time-varying graphical lasso (LTGL), a method for multivariate time-series graphical modelling that considers the influence of hidden or unmeasurable factors. The estimation of the contribution of the latent factors is embedded in the model which produces both sparse and low-rank components for each time point. In particular, the first component represents the connectivity structure of observable variables of the system, while the second represents the influence of hidden factors, assumed to be few with respect to the observed variables. Our model includes temporal consistency on both components, providing an accurate evolutionary pattern of the system. We derive a tractable optimisation algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers, and develop a scalable and efficient implementation which exploits proximity operators in closed form. LTGL is extensively validated on synthetic data, achieving optimal performance in terms of accuracy, structure learning and scalability with respect to ground truth and state-of-the-art methods for graphical inference. We conclude with the application of LTGL to real case studies, from biology and finance, to illustrate how our method can be successfully employed to gain insights on multivariate time-series data.",2018,Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining

Heavy metals in fish from the Aleutians: interspecific and locational differences.,"The objectives of this study were to examine levels of arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and selenium in edible tissue of seven species of marine fish collected from several Aleutian islands (in 2004) to determine: (1) interspecific differences, (2) locational differences (among Aleutian Islands), (3) size-related differences in any metal levels within a species, and (4) potential risk to the fish or to predators on the fish, including humans. We also compared metals levels to those of three other fish species previously examined in detail, as well as examining metals in the edible tissue of octopus (Octopus dofleini). Octopus did not have the highest levels of any metal. There were significant interspecific differences in all metal levels among the fish species, although the differences were less than an order of magnitude, except for arsenic (mean of 19,500 ppb in Flathead sole, Hippoglossoides elassodon). Significant intraisland variation occurred among the four sites on Amchitka, but there was not a consistent pattern. There were significant interisland differences for some metals and species. Mercury levels increased significantly with size for several species; lead increased significantly for only one fish species; and cadmium and selenium decreased significantly with size for halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). The Alaskan Department of Health and Social Services supports unrestricted consumption of most Alaskan fish species for all people, including pregnant women. Most mean metal concentrations were well below the levels known to adversely affect the fish themselves, or predators that consume them (including humans), except for mercury in three fish species (mean levels just below 0.3 ppm), and arsenic in two fish species. However, even at low mercury levels, people who consume fish almost daily will exceed guideline values from the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency.",2014,Environmental research
High dimensional Sparse Gaussian Graphical Mixture Model,This paper considers the problem of networks reconstruction from heterogeneous data using a Gaussian Graphical Mixture Model (GGMM). It is well known that parameter estimation in this context is challenging due to large numbers of variables coupled with the degeneracy of the likelihood. We propose as a solution a penalized maximum likelihood technique by imposing an $l_{1}$ penalty on the precision matrix. Our approach shrinks the parameters thereby resulting in better identifiability and variable selection. We use the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm which involves the graphical LASSO to estimate the mixing coefficients and the precision matrices. We show that under certain regularity conditions the Penalized Maximum Likelihood (PML) estimates are consistent. We demonstrate the performance of the PML estimator through simulations and we show the utility of our method for high dimensional data analysis in a genomic application.,2013,ArXiv
After Spanish Rule: Postcolonial Predicaments of the Americas,"Insisting on the critical value of Latin American histories for recasting theories of postcolonialism, After Spanish Rule is the first collection of essays by Latin Americanist historians and anthropologists to engage postcolonial debates from the perspective of the Americas. These essays extend and revise the insights of postcolonial studies in diverse Latin American contexts, ranging from the narratives of eighteenth-century travelers and clerics in the region to the status of indigenous intellectuals in present-day Colombia. The editors argue that the construction of an array of singular histories at the intersection of particular colonialisms and nationalisms must become the critical project of postcolonial history-writing.

Challenging the universalizing tendencies of postcolonial theory as it has developed in the Anglophone academy, the contributors are attentive to the crucial ways in which the histories of Latin American countriesâ€”with their creole elites, hybrid middle classes, subordinated ethnic groups, and complicated historical relationships with Spain and the United Statesâ€”differ from those of other former colonies in the southern hemisphere. Yet, while acknowledging such differences, the volume suggests a host of provocative, critical connections to colonial and postcolonial histories around the world.

"Cannings and Samworth introduce a very general method for high dimensional classification, based on careful combination of the results of applying an arbitrary base classifier to random projections of the feature vectors","High-dimensional statistics refers to statistical inference when the number of unknown parameters p is much larger than the sample size n. This includes regression and supervised classification models, when the number of covariates is of much larger order than n, and unsupervised settings, such as clustering, with more variables than observations. Image processing, information retrieval in text documents, food authentication studies are only a few examples of the applications in which such problems arise. In those contexts, standard statistical methods cannot be applied, as the involved matrices are in general not full rank and cannot be inverted. A solution to this problem, which has attracted large attention in the statistical literature, involves imposing a sparse structure on the estimated vector parameters through the introduction of an L1 penalty on their norm. Lasso (Tibshirani 1996) based approaches to regression, classification and dimension reduction methods have been populating the statistical literature since Tibshiraniâ€™s seminal paper.

Optimism Bias Correction in Omics Studies with Big Data: Assessment of Penalized Methods on Simulated Data.,"Big Data generated by omics technologies require simultaneous analyses of large numbers of variables. This leads to complex model selection and parameter estimates that show optimism bias. This study on simulated data sets examined optimism-bias correction by penalty regression methods in case-control studies that involve clinical and omics variables. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-based methods (LASSO-penalized logistic regression, adaptive LASSO, and regularized LASSO for selection + ridge regression) were evaluated using power, the false positive rate (FPR), false discovery rate (FDR), and by estimated versus theoretical parameter comparisons. The ""ordinary"" LASSO overcorrects the optimism bias. The adaptive LASSO with LASSO estimation of the weights was unable to provide a sufficient correction. Importantly, the adaptive LASSO with ridge estimation of the weights showed the best parameter estimation. The regularized LASSO selection showed a slight optimism bias that decreased with the increase in the training set size. The optimism bias decreased with the increase of the number of variables selected among truly differentially expressed variables; however, power, FPR, and FDR were correlated. A compromise between model selection and estimation accuracy should be found. These results might prove useful because Big Data analyses are becoming commonplace in omics/multiomics studies in integrative biology, precision medicine, and planetary health.",2019,Omics : a journal of integrative biology
URTeC : 2897507 Statistical Controls on Induced Seismicity,"Seismicity in Oklahoma has shown a sharp increase since 2010 and is mostly attributed to wells used to dispose wastewater from hydraulically fractured production wells (McClure, Gibson, Chiu, & Ranganath, 2017). Many studies are conducted so far to include / eliminate various causes and solutions to this problem. The recent studies in this research area (Holland, 2011), show a general consensus on the main cause of the seismic events (earthquakes) as the high volume disposal in the Arbuckle formation causing the critically stressed faults in the basement rock to fail. Some of these studies include the modeling and simulation of the physical processes whereas some studies delve into the statistical analyses of the relationships between disposal wells and induced seismicity. However, most of the previous attempts on the statistical analysis of this dataset use a more qualitative view of the problem (Langenbruch & Zoback, 2016) instead of quantifying the impact of various parameters such as injection rate, volumes, pressures, etc. Other work like Gogri et al. (2017) uses geo-modeling and simulation approach, but this constraint the modeling to a smaller section due to limitations on the seismic data extent. In this work, we use various data analytics methods to quantify the impact of different injection well parameters and rock properties on the earthquake event magnitude and intensity. Our models show that hierarchical and K-means clustering are able to group the wells into clusters that conforms with the earthquake event density. Including more clusters in our analysis refined the results but in general, four clusters are enough to capture the trends in our dataset. Fuzzy clustering, which is a soft clustering yields good results only after number of clusters exceed five. For predictive modeling part, Gradient boost regression and random forest work better than least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), elastic nets and linear models. Introduction One of the key challenges in the quantification of the seismic events is the spatial and temporal relationships between the rock and well parameters. As the injection parameters change from one year to the next, the inputs are nonstationary. The second challenge is the definition of the events that will be modeled. Adding to the complexity, there are other more involved facets of this problem like determining the exact location of the seismic events. In this work, we have assumed the location of the events given by Oklahoma Corporate Commission (OCC) is exact, and we formulate our problem-based on these. In this work we have attempted a suite of clustering and predictive modeling techniques. We present the results from the models that best fitted our dataset and are able to incorporate the variables interpreted as key indicators based on our expert knowledge. Our model is primarily based on the waste water disposal well information from OCC. The major challenge that we faced in our work is that the number of data points for the analysis is not optimal and the well operating conditions are not constant throughout the well injection cycle. The time window of analysis in our study is from year 2010 to year 2016. Some wells start in 2010 and stop injecting for a while. Some new wells are added and some wells are abandoned. Also in the later period the â€œtraffic lightâ€ (McNamara et al., 2015) approach adopted by OCC makes the analysis difficult. To resolve this, we take the median injection values and peak values of different input parameters.",2018,
Using Machine Learning to Model Claims Experience and Reporting Delays for Pricing and Reserving,"In this paper we review existing modelling approaches for analysing claims experience in the presence of reporting delays, reviewing the formulation of mortality incidence models such as GLMs. We then show how these approaches have traditionally been adjusted for late reporting of claims using either the IBNR approach or the more recent EBNER approach. We then go on to introduce a new model formulation that combines a model for late reported claims with a model for mortality incidence into a single model formulation. We then illustrate the use and performance of the traditional and the combined model formulations on data from a multinational reinsurer. We show how GLMs, lasso regression, gradient boosted trees and deep learning can be applied to the new formulation to produce results of superior accuracy compared to the traditional approaches.",2019,

The novel strain shared highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (91.5â€‰% each) with 'Nitratireductor shengliensis' CGMCC 1.12519 and Hoeflea halophila JG120-1T and lower sequence similarity (â€‰<â€‰91.5â€‰%) with other species. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed a distinct taxonomic position attained by strain LS-861T within the clade that accommodated members of the family Phyllobacteriaceae. The major fatty acids were C16â€‰:â€‰0, iso-C17â€‰:â€‰1Ï‰10c, C18â€‰:â€‰0 3-OH and C18â€‰:â€‰1Ï‰7c/C18â€‰:â€‰1Ï‰6c. The polar lipid profile was relatively simple as compared with other representatives of Phyllobacteriaceae, by having major amounts of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and an unidentified glycolipid, and moderate amounts of three unidentified phospholipids and an unidentified aminolipid. The DNA G+C content was 61.2â€Šmol%. The predominant quinone system was ubiquinone-10 (Q-10). The data in general and phylogenetic and polar lipid data in particular clearly distinguish the novel strain from related species at the genus level. Thus, strain LS-861T is suggested to represent a novel species of a new genus of the family Phyllobacteriaceae, for which the name Thalassocola ureilytica gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Thalassocola ureilytica is LS-861T (â€‰=â€‰BCRC 80818T =â€‰JCM 30682T).",2015,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Integrative approaches to reconstruct regulatory networks from multi-omics data : A review of state-ofthe-art methods,"Data generation using high throughput technologies has led to the accumulation of diverse types of molecular data.These data have different types (discrete,real,string etc.) and occur in various formats and sizes. Datasets including gene expression, miRNA expression, proteinDNA binding data (ChIP-Seq/ChIP-ChIP), mutation data(copy number variation, single nucleotide polymorphisms), GO annotations, proteinprotein interaction and disease-gene association data are some of the commonly used genomic datasets to study biological processes. Each of them provides a unique, complementary and partly independent view of the genome and hence embed essential information about their regulatory mechanisms. In order to understand the functions of genes, proteins and analyze mechanisms arising out of their interactions, information provided by each of these datasets individually may not be sufficient. Therefore integrating these multi-omic data and inferring regulatory interactions from the integrated dataset provides a system level biological insights in predicting gene functions and their phenotypic outcomes. To study genome functionality through interaction networks, different methods have been proposed for collective mining of information from an integrated dataset. We survey here data integration approaches using state-of-the-art techniques such as network integration, Bayesian networks, regularized regression (LASSO) and multiple kernel learning methods.",2018,
Contemporary Art and the Politics of Ecology,"This special issue of Third Text, dedicated to contemporary art and the politics of ecology, investigates the intersection of art criticism, politico-ecological theory, environmental activism and postcolonial globalization. The focus is on practices and discourses of eco-aesthetics that have emerged in recent years in geopolitical areas as diverse as the Arctic, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Europe and Mexico. The numerous contributors address new aesthetic strategies through which current ecological emergencies â€“ including but not limited to the multifaceted crisis of climate change â€“ have found resonance and creative response in artistic practice and more broadly in visual culture. Numerous key questions motivated our investigation: If ecological imperatives are frequently invoked by governments, corporations and certain strands of environmental activism in the name of a post-political â€˜greenâ€™ consensus for which nothing less than the life of the planet is at stake, how might critical art contribute to an imagination of ecology that addresses social divisions related to race, class, gender and geography in the North and South alike? How might the concept of biopolitics, as elaborated by figures ranging from Bruno Latour to Vandana Shiva, enable a rethinking of hitherto articulated discourses of eco-aesthetics, especially as regards the relationship between ecological art and eco-feminism, or the art and ecology of democratic political composition? How might cultural practitioners contest the financialization of nature by neoliberal globalization, as analysed in Marxist approaches to political ecology, and how might they provide alternatives to the economic valuation of nature or promote a new articulation of the commons against its corporate enclosure? To what extent are recent philosophical writings associated with the so-called â€˜speculative realismâ€™ movement (for instance, those of Robin Mackay, Ray Brassier, Graham Harman, Quentin Meillassoux, Iain Hamilton Grant, and Timothy Morton) pertinent to contemporary endeavours in rethinking ecology and activism, considering nonhuman environmental agency, or positing experimental Third Text, Vol. 27, Issue 1, January, 2013, 1â€“9",2013,Third Text
Aubrieta deltoidea (L.) DC. (Brassicaceae) in Ukraine and Eastern Europe,"The genus Aubrieta Adans. includes 12-24 species naturally distributed in South-West Asia (mainly in Anatolia) and in South and Southeast Europe. Most of these species grow in mountain, subalpine and alpine altitudinal belts. The most common is A. deltoidea (L.) DC. It has long been known as a garden ornamental plant in Western Europe and in other countries. During the last 10-15 years, plants of this species began to be cultivated in Ukraine and in Eastern Europe. For the genus and for A. deltoidea, the nomenclature, basic synonymy, complete morphological description, ecological affinity, range, and also features of distribution in Ukraine and in Eastern Europe are given at the first time. Based on the analysis and generalization of ecological and biological specificity, features of plant distribution and cultivation, it was suggested that in the climatic conditions of Ukraine A. deltoidea plants may run wild and form spontaneous populations.

Sparse Multi-Path Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems,"Sparse multi-path is encountered in OFDM and Ultra-wideBand (UWB) communications. Conventional channel estimation methods ignore the prior knowledge of the sparseness, and estimates have higher MSE. We introduced two approaches: Lp norm constraint method and LASSO method which are related to Bayesian model. The two approaches exploit the sparse a priori and obtain better performance.",2008,"2008 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing"
"Lefschetz properties, Schur polynomials and Jordan canonical forms (Combinatorial Representation Theory and Related Topics)","Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p\geq 0 , and J( $\alpha$, m) means the Jordan block with eigenvalue $\alpha$\in k and size m . We shall consider the problem of finding out a Jordan canonical form of J( $\alpha$, m)\otimes J($\beta$_{i}n) , where \otimes means \otimes_{k} (m\leq n) . Over an algebraically closed base field of characteristic zero, this problem has been solved by many authors including T. Harima and J. Watanabe [4], and A. Martsinkovsky and A. Vlassov [8] etc. M. Herschend [5] solve it for extended quivers of type \~{A}_{n} , with arbitrary orientation and any n . In this note we solve it for any characteristic p\geq 0 . That is, we obtain two way to determine the Jordan decomposition of the tensored matrix J( $\alpha$, m)\otimes J( $\beta$, n) . In the case of $\alpha \beta$=0 , the tensored matrix J( $\alpha$, m)\otimes J( $\beta$, n) has the same direct sum decomposition as in Theorem 2.1 independently of characteristic of the base field k in Proposition 2.6.

Network-Scale Traffic Modeling and Forecasting with Graphical Lasso,"Traffic flow forecasting is an important application domain of machine learning. How to use the information provided by adjacent links more efficiently is a key to improving the performance of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In this paper, we build a sparse graphical model for multi-link traffic flow through the Graphical Lasso (GL) algorithm and then implement the forecasting with Neural Networks. Through a large number of experiments, we find that network-scale traffic forecasting with modeling by Graphical Lasso performs much better than previous research. Traditional approaches considered the information provided by adjacent links but did not extract the information. Thus, although they improved the performance to some extent, they did not make good use of the information. Furthermore, we summarize the theoretical analysis of Graphical Lasso algorithm. From theoretical and practical points of view, we fully verify the superiority of Graphical Lasso used in modeling for multi-link traffic flow forecasting.",2011,
Electrophysiological brain signatures for the classification of subjective cognitive decline: towards an individual detection in the preclinical stages of dementia,"BackgroundAlzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) prevalence is rapidly growing as worldwide populations grow older. Available treatments have failed to slow down disease progression, thus increasing research focus towards early or preclinical stages of the disease. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is known to increase the risk of developing AD and several other negative outcomes. However, it is still very scarcely characterized and there is no neurophysiological study devoted to its individual classification which could improve targeted sample recruitment for clinical trials.MethodsTwo hundred fifty-two older adults (70 healthy controls, 91 SCD, and 91 MCI) underwent a magnetoencephalography scan. Alpha relative power in the source space was employed to train a LASSO classifier and applied to distinguish between healthy controls and SCD. Moreover, MCI participants were used to further validate the previously trained algorithm.ResultsThe classifier was significantly associated to SCD with an AUC of 0.81 in the whole sample. After randomly splitting the sample in 2/3 for discovery and 1/3 for validation, the newly trained classifier was also able to correctly classify SCD individuals with an AUC of 0.75 in the validation sample. The regions selected by the algorithm included medial frontal, temporal, and occipital areas. The algorithm trained to select SCD individuals was also significantly associated to MCI diagnostic.ConclusionsAccording to our results, magnetoencephalography could be a useful tool for distinguishing individuals with SCD and healthy older adults without cognitive concerns. Furthermore, our classifier showed good external validity, being not only successful for an unseen SCD sample, but also in a different population with MCI cases. This supports its utility in the context of preclinical dementia. These findings highlight the potential applications of electrophysiological techniques to improve sample recruitment at the individual level in the context of clinical trials.",2019,Alzheimer's Research & Therapy
Lack of chemical defense in two species of stalked crinoids: Support for the predation hypothesis for mesozoic bathymetric restriction,"Abstract Methanol/dichloromethane extracts of (1) the arms and pinnules, and (2) the stalk and cirri of the deep water stalked crinoids Endoxocrinus parrae (Gervais) and Neocrinus decorus (Carpenter) were imbedded at ecologically relevant volumetric concentrations in alginate food pellets containing 2% krill as a feeding stimulant and presented in situ to an assemblage of shallow-water reef fish. Experimental pellets were highly palatable to reef fish; no significant differences in pellet consumption occurred between experimental pellets containing extracts from either species of stalked crinoid or control pellets. Small pieces of cirri, stalks, calyx, arms and pinnules of both species were also tested in in situ feeding assays. While immediate consumption by fish was not apparent, Blue Headed Wrasse ( Thalassoma bifasciatum (Block)) and Dusky Damselfish ( Stegastes fuscus (Cuvier)) bit at pieces of each body component. Similar fish biting behaviors were also observed when two living Endoxocrinus parrae were deployed on the shallow reef. Observations indicate that neither species of stalked crinoid is chemically defended from predation by a natural assemblage of reef fish. This supports the predation hypothesis that restriction of stalked crinoids in deep-water habitats may have resulted from the Mesozoic radiation of durophagous fishes in shallow seas, resulting in a reduction of stalked crinoids from shallow water.",1999,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology
The Bayesian Lasso Trevor Park,"The Lasso estimate for linear regression parameters can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior mode estimate when the regression parameters have independent Laplace (double-exponential) priors. Gibbs sampling from this posterior is possible using an expanded hierarchy with conjugate normal priors for the regression parameters and independent exponential priors on their variances. A connection with the inverse Gaussian distribution provides tractable full conditional distributions. The Bayesian Lasso provides interval estimates (Bayesian credible intervals) that can guide variable selection. Moreover, the structure of the hierarchical model provides both Bayesian and likelihood methods for selecting the Lasso parameter. Slight modifications lead to Bayesian versions of other Lasso-related estimation methods like bridge regression and a robust variant.",2005,
Cognitive development: at the crossroads?,"In the words of the old Robert Johnson blues song â€˜I wenttothe crossroads (mama), Ilookedeast andwestâ€™. The ï¬eldof cognitive development, which traces it roots back toJean Piaget and earlier, faces a choice. On the one hand,powerful new approaches from genetics, functional imag-ing, developmental psychopathology and computationalmodelling, offer a tempting future pathway. On the otherhand, some believe these new possibilities are a mirage,and that we should not be distracted from describinghuman developmental change at the cognitive level basedon behavioural experiments.In the 1970s and 80s cognitive psychology began topermeate the older ï¬eld of child psychology resulting in asubdisciplineofcognitivedevelopment.Althoughthisthrusthad many successes and greatly advanced our under-standing in certain domains, a less positive outcome wasthat it focussed researchers on describing steady states atdifferent ages rather than focussing on processes of change[1]. A number of recent advances have lead to renewedattention on understanding mechanisms of developmentalchange. One advance is research on the types of learningmechanisms that drive developmental change, oftenimplementedand testedin computational models. Asecondis an investigation of the types of changes in mental repre-sentations that occur during development (see Johnson MPosner & Rothbart; Aslin & Fiser). Connectionist andneural-network models provide tools for the exploration ofdifferent theories about the extent and nature of plasticityduring development (Elman). Studies that compare typicalandatypicaldevelopmentaltrajectoriesallowustoexaminethe scope and limits of plasticity (Scerif & Karmiloff-Smith ,Stilesetal.,Maurer,Lewis&Mondloch).Comparisonswithotherspeciesallowustoassessthedevelopmentofcognitiveabilities in the absence of language (GoÂ´mez).There is great potential for these recent advances toinform theories of cognitive development. For example,the advent of child-friendly functional imaging offers anumber of advantages to the ï¬eld. At a purely practicallevel, there are enormous difï¬culties in making inferencesabout the developing mind from non-verbal behaviouralmeasures alone. Although behavioural methods willcontinue to remain important, more direct measures ofbrain function can now be obtained without any responsebeing required from the participant, a major advantage inyoung children. More interestingly, neuroimaging offersthe potential to explore questions such as whether thesame behaviour in infants and adults is mediated by thesame patterns of cortical activation? Connectionist andneural-network models provide tools that can be used toformalize and assess theories of developmental change.These models can have different degrees of neuralplausibility and can instantiate a variety of theoreticalperspectives on the extent and nature of environmentalinï¬‚uence.Although the newly emerging ï¬eld of developmentalcognitive neuroscience, and its associated technology, hasgenerated much excitement, there are also sceptics whofear that it will not advance progress on the key issuesthat have dominated developmental psychology fordecades. The ability to collect rich and complex data setsfrom the typical and atypical developing brain of theinfant and child does not in itself guarantee that thecrucial experiments for testing theories of developmentalchange will be conducted. Limitations and constraintsimposed by the available neuroimaging and compu-tational methods could bias experimenters towards par-ticulartheoreticalperspectives.Forexample,theabilitytoimage and localize brain function in children couldencourage a view of mental development in terms of theaddition of static computational modules. Similarly,connectionist network modelling has not usually beenused to explore nativist accounts of development.The agenda of this special issue, which grew out of arecent meeting (The XXIst Meeting of the InternationalAssociation for the Study of Attention and Performance,Processes of Change in Brain and Cognitive Development,26 Julyâ€“1 August, 2004 in Winter Park, Colorado) is toassess how evidence from cognitive neuroscience hascontributed to the current state of knowledge aboutprocesses of change during human mental development,and to discuss the ways in which these techniques andtoolscanbeharnessedtoaddressthefundamentalquestions of cognitive development.",2005,Trends in Cognitive Sciences
Levels of dioxins and polybrominated diphenyl ethers and longitudinal changes of dioxins in human milk in northern China,"Objectives Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of chemicals which enter the environment due to accidental emissions or to human activities such as mining, industrial emissions, agricultural practices, waste disposal, combustion, heating, and traff ic. There are widely distributed levels in air, water and other environment. As their high stability and lipophilic properties, they accumulate in the food chain and are toxic to humans and wildlife. The studies on polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofrans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphyls (dl-PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in human milk from Mainland China have been relatively limited. So far, no longitudinal comparison on PCDD/Fs, dlPCBs have been carried out in China. The aims of the present study are to investigate the spatial differences of PCDD/Fs, dl-PCBs and PBDEs in northern China and to elucidate longitudinal comparison of PCDD/Fs, dl-PCBs in humans living in Shijiazhuang area. In the same time, we investigated the dietary habits of donors from these areas to assess the dietary risk factor and to identify the associate between food contamination and these chemicals. Methods We collected human milk samples from 60 breast-feeding mothers in Tianjin, 48 in Yantai and 50 in Shijiazhuang from November 2006 to April 2007, and from 30 mothers in Shijiazhuang from November 2002 to February 2003, respectively.

First Detection of Leishmania infantum in Domestic Dogs from Burkina Faso (West Africa),"Background and Objective: Human Visceral Leishmaniasis (HVL) is a systemic neglected tropical diseases and potentially lethal disease caused by infection with protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. In the causal, agent of HVL is L. infantum and dogs are a major reservoir host. Visceral leishmaniasis is rarely found in West Africa and no cases have been reported to date in Burkina Faso. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the presence of L. infantum in population of domestic dogs in Bobo-Dioulasso city in Burkina Faso. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out in five districts of the city Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. An active survey was conducted in households with dogs in five districts of the city for canine leishmaniasis screening. Epidemiological data and clinical signs were collected for each dog. Venous blood collection and skin lesions biopsies were performed in dogs after informed consent of the owners. The plasma was used for the immunological diagnosis (DiaMed-IT LEISH) and positive samples were confirmed by nested PCR. Results: A total of 85 dogs were included in the study. For the first time, the occurrence of L. infantum in Burkina Faso was confirmed in five domestic dogs presenting symptomatic signs by immunochromatographic tests. Biopsy samples were positive for L. infantum in PCR analysis. Conclusion: The findings indicated that L. infantum is circulating within canine populations in Bobo-Dioulasso. Infected dogs would be the reservoir hosts of this visceralising species. Several priorities for public and veterinary health research have been highlighted by this study.",2016,Research Journal of Parasitology

Hyperparameter estimation in maximum a posteriori regression using group sparsity with an application to brain imaging,"Hyperparameter estimation is a recurrent problem in the signal and statistics literature. Popular strategies are cross-validation or Bayesian inference, yet it remains an active topic of research in order to offer better or faster algorithms. The models considered here are sparse regression models with convex or non-convex group-Lasso-like penalties. Following the recent work of Pereyra et al. [1] we study the fixed point iteration algorithm they propose and show that, while it may be suitable for an analysis prior, it suffers from limitations when using high-dimensional sparse synthesis models. The first contribution of this paper is to show how to overcome this issue. Secondly, we demonstrate how one can extend the model to estimate a vector of regularization parameters. We illustrate this on models with group sparsity reporting improved support recovery and reduced amplitude bias on the estimated coefficients. This approach is compared with an alternative method that uses a single parameter but a non-convex penalty. Results are presented on simulations and an inverse problem relevant for neuroscience which is the localization of brain activations using magneto/electroencephalography.",2017,2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
Beyond $\ell_1$-norm minimization for sparse signal recovery,"Sparse signal recovery has been dominated by the basis pursuit denoise (BPDN) problem formulation for over a decade. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that outperforms BPDN in finding sparse solutions to underdetermined linear systems of equations at no additional computational cost. Our algorithm, called WSPGL1, is a modification of the spectral projected gradient for $\ell_1$ minimization (SPGL1) algorithm in which the sequence of LASSO subproblems are replaced by a sequence of weighted LASSO subproblems with constant weights applied to a support estimate. The support estimate is derived from the data and is updated at every iteration. The algorithm also modifies the Pareto curve at every iteration to reflect the new weighted $\ell_1$ minimization problem that is being solved. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that the sparse recovery performance of our algorithm is superior to that of $\ell_1$ minimization and approaches the recovery performance of iterative re-weighted $\ell_1$ (IRWL1) minimization of Cand{\`e}s, Wakin, and Boyd, although it does not match it in general. Moreover, our algorithm has the computational cost of a single BPDN problem.",2012,arXiv: Information Theory
The Heterogeneous Impacts of R&D on Innovation in Services Sector: A Firm-Level Study of Developing ASEAN,"Identifying the determinants of firmsâ€™ investment in knowledge, this study first explores the heterogeneous impacts of research and development (R&D) on product, process, organization, and marketing innovation. Second, it examines if there exists a complementary (substitute) relation in terms of firmsâ€™ preference between four types of innovation. Studying 1500 firms of seven developing economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), a machine learning-based regression, to identify key predictors likely to influence firmsâ€™ R&D propensity and intensity. Estimating the knowledge function, we foundâ€”in line with LASSOâ€”that medium-sized firms, human capital (training) and credit facilities favorably affect firmsâ€™ decision to invest in R&D. Contrarily, the impact is adverse if the first or main product generates firmsâ€™ large share of revenue, a unique finding not captured by previous studies. The marginal effects of four univariate probit models indicate that firmsâ€™ investment in R&D translates into innovation. However, the application of the Gewekeâ€“Hajivassiliourâ€“Keane (GHK)-simulator based multivariate probit, which considers simultaneity of firmsâ€™ innovation decisions that univariate probit ignores, suggests that the relationship between different types of innovation is complementary. Firmsâ€™ strategy to adopt a particular type of innovation is influenced by other types. This led to the estimation of R&Dâ€™s impact on technological and nontechnological innovation, which shows that while firms innovate both types, there is a skewed link between nontechnological innovation and the services sector.",2020,Sustainability
Paper de la molÃ¨cula adaptadora 3BP2 en la senyalitzaciÃ³ dels receptors leucocitaris de la famÃ­lia del CD150,"La familia del CD150, esta formada per receptors de la superfamilia de les immunoglobulines, expressats en la membrana de cellules del sistema immune. Es caracteritzen per compartir una elevada homologia estructural i localitzar en la mateixa posicio 23 del brac llarg del cromosoma 1. Els membres de la familia CD84, CD150, CD229, CD244, CD319 i NTB-A presenten una regio intracellular amb, com a minim, un motiu tirosina del tipus T-V/I-Y-XX-V/I. Aquest es el motiu consens dunio duna familia de molecules adaptadores anomenades SAP i EAT-2. En humans, deficiencies en SAP, son responsables duna immunodeficiencia primaria lligada al cromosoma X, caracteritzada per una extrema susceptibilitat al virus de lEpstein-Barr, amb mononucleosi infecciosa fulminant. Lobjectiu daquesta tesi ha estat identificar nous lligands intracellulars pel receptor CD244 i poder aixi, comprendre millor les funcions derivades de lactivacio daquest membre de la familia. Lactivacio del CD244 (o 2B4) comporta una activacio de la citotoxicitat i increment de la produccio de lIFN-gamma de les cellules NK i limfocits T citotoxics CD8+. Mitjancant la tecnica del triple hibrid en llevats, hem trobat que la molecula 3BP2 interacciona directament ambla regio intracellular el CD244 en condicions de fosforilacio. El 3BP2 es una molecula adaptadora dexpressio preferent en el cellules de llinatge hematopoetic, que sense tenir cap activitat catalitica, te la capacitat de reclutar diferents proteines, formant un signalosoma i participant positivament en lactivacio de cellules hematopoietiques. En humans, mutacions puntuals en el 3BP2, son responsables duna malaltia autosomica dominant anomenada querubisme, caracteritzada per una degradacio dels ossos de les maxilles, relacionat amb una disfuncio dels osteoclasts.

Demostrem que el 3BP2 esta afectant i potenciant la via dERK i la capacitat litica de la cellula NK. En canvi, ni lactivitat de la p38 ni la produccio dIFN-gamma es veuen alterades per la presencia o absencia del 3BP2. Proposem el 3BP2 com a la molecula que dicta la dicotomia de la resposta de la cellula NK. Tambe analitzarem la interaccio directe del 3BP2 amb els altres membres de la familia del CD150, mitjancant al tecnica del triple hibrid.

"" SUMMARY:
""ROLE OF THE ADAPTOR MOLECULE 3BP2 REGULATING CD150 LEUKOCYTE RECEPTOR FAMILY FUNCTION""
TEXT:
CD84, CD150, CD229, CD244, CD319 and NTB-A are members of CD150 family of leukocyte receptors, with the capacity to associate with the family of adaptors SAP and EAT-2 through a tyrosine motif in their cytosolic tail. In humans, SAP deficiencies are responsible for an immunodeficiency called X-linked lymphoprolipherative syndrome (XLP syndrome) characterized by an extreme susceptibility to Epstein-Bar virus. The main goal of this thesis was to identify and characterize new intracellular partners for CD244 (2B4) receptor. This receptor activates NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production. Using three-hybrid system, we identified 3BP2 as a binding partner for the receptor. 3BP2 is an adaptor molecule, whose deficiency is linked to a human disease called querubisme, characterized by a degradation of maxillary bones related to osteoclast dysfunction. The interaction between the receptor and the adaptor was bioquemically characterized in an NK cell line and in NK cells from peripheral blood. Next, we studied the implications of 3BP2 during CD244 activation in NK cells. We demonstrated that 3BP2 potentates ERK pathway and cytotoxicity. However, p38 activation and IFN-gamma are not influenced by the adaptor. 3BP2 is established to be the molecule responsible for the dichotomy function of CD244. We also analyzed the interaction between 3BP2 and the other members of CD150 family using three-hybrid system. We found that CD229 (Ly9) can recruit the adaptor. It has been described that CD229 attenuates ERK and NFAT activation during TCR triggering in T lymphocytes. The studies developed in this thesis, indicate that 3BP2 enhances CD229 inhibition during TCR activation.
So, this thesis has bioquemically and functionally characterized the implication of the adaptor molecule 3BP2 in regulating the activation of two members of CD150 family of receptors. In one hand, by interacting with CD244, the adaptor enhances NK cytotoxicity. On the other, by associating with CD229, 3BP2 enhances the attenuation of T lymphocyte activation. So, 3BP2 depending on the signalosma complex that creates, positively or negatively regulates these types of cells response.""",2006,
Differentiating Concepts and Instances for Knowledge Graph Embedding,"Concepts, which represent a group of different instances sharing common properties, are essential information in knowledge representation. Most conventional knowledge embedding methods encode both entities (concepts and instances) and relations as vectors in a low dimensional semantic space equally, ignoring the difference between concepts and instances. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph embedding model named TransC by differentiating concepts and instances. Specifically, TransC encodes each concept in knowledge graph as a sphere and each instance as a vector in the same semantic space. We use the relative positions to model the relations between concepts and instances (i.e., instanceOf), and the relations between concepts and sub-concepts (i.e., subClassOf). We evaluate our model on both link prediction and triple classification tasks on the dataset based on YAGO. Experimental results show that TransC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and captures the semantic transitivity for instanceOf and subClassOf relation. Our codes and datasets can be obtained from https:// github.com/davidlvxin/TransC.",2018,ArXiv
Longitudinal associations between learning assistants and instructor effectiveness,"A central goal of the Learning Assistant (LA) model is to improve students' learning of science through the transformation of instructor practices. There is minimal existing research on the impact of college physics instructor experiences on their effectiveness. To investigate the association between college introductory physics instructors' experiences with and without LAs and student learning, we drew on data from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes (LASSO) database. The LASSO database provided us with student-level data (concept inventory scores and demographic data) for 4,365 students and course-level data (instructor experience and course features) for the students' 93 mechanics courses. We performed Hierarchical Multiple Imputation to impute missing data and Hierarchical Linear Modeling to nest students within courses when modeling the associations between instructor experience and student learning. Our models predict that instructors' effectiveness decreases as they gain experience teaching without LAs. However, LA supported environments appear to remediate this decline in effectiveness as instructor effectiveness is maintained while they gain experience teaching with LAs.",2017,arXiv: Physics Education
Predicting human age using regional morphometry and inter-regional morphological similarity,"The goal of this study is predicting human age using neuro-metrics derived from structural MRI, as well as investigating the relationships between age and predictive neuro-metrics. To this end, a cohort of healthy subjects were recruited from 1000 Functional Connectomes Project. The ages of the participations were ranging from 7 to 83 (36.17Â±20.46). The structural MRI for each subject was preprocessed using FreeSurfer, resulting in regional cortical thickness, mean curvature, regional volume and regional surface area for 148 anatomical parcellations. The individual age was predicted from the combination of regional and inter-regional neuro-metrics. The prediction accuracy is r = 0.835, p < 0.00001, evaluated by Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted ages and actual ages. Moreover, the LASSO linear regression also found certain predictive features, most of which were inter-regional features. The turning-point of the developmental trajectories in human brain was around 40 years old based on regional cortical thickness. In conclusion, structural MRI could be potential biomarkers for the aging in human brain. The human age could be successfully predicted from the combination of regional morphometry and inter-regional morphological similarity. The inter-regional measures could be beneficial to investigating human brain connectome.",2016,
Predicting with Proxies: Transfer Learning in High Dimension,"Predictive analytics is increasingly used to guide decision-making in many applications. However, in practice, we often have limited data on the true predictive task of interest, and must instead rely on more abundant data on a closely-related proxy predictive task. For example, e-commerce platforms use abundant customer click data (proxy) to make product recommendations rather than the relatively sparse customer purchase data (true outcome of interest); alternatively, hospitals often rely on medical risk scores trained on a different patient population (proxy) rather than their own patient population (true cohort of interest) to assign interventions. Yet, not accounting for the bias in the proxy can lead to sub-optimal decisions. Using real datasets, we find that this bias can often be captured by a sparse function of the features. Thus, we propose a novel two-step estimator that uses techniques from high-dimensional statistics to efficiently combine a large amount of proxy data and a small amount of true data. We prove upper bounds on the error of our proposed estimator and lower bounds on several heuristics used by data scientists; in particular, our proposed estimator can achieve the same accuracy with exponentially less true data (in the number of features). Our proof relies on a new LASSO tail inequality for approximately sparse vectors. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on e-commerce and healthcare datasets; in both cases, we achieve significantly better predictive accuracy as well as managerial insights into the nature of the bias in the proxy data.",2018,arXiv: Machine Learning
The influence of sample selection on the structure of psychopathology symptom networks: An example with alcohol use disorder.,"Increasingly, the structure of mental disorders has been studied in the form of a network, characterizing how symptoms or criteria interact with and influence each other. Many studies of psychiatric symptoms and diagnostic criteria employ community or population-based surveys using co-occurrence of the symptoms/criteria to form the networks. However, given the overall low prevalence rates of mental disorders and their symptoms in the general population, most of those surveyed may not exhibit or endorse any symptoms and yet are often included in network analyses. Consequently, because network models are built on associations between symptoms/criteria, much of the observed variability is driven by individuals who are asymptomatic. Using data from the National Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) Wave 2 and NESARC-III, we explore the effect of these ""asymptomatic"" observations on the estimated relations among diagnostic criteria of alcohol use disorder to determine the effects of such observations on estimated networks. We do so using the eLasso tool, as well as with traditional measures of correlation between binary variables (the Î¦ coefficient and odds ratio). We find that when the proportion of asymptomatic individuals are systematically culled from the sample, the estimated pairwise relations are often significantly affected, even changing signs in some cases. Our findings indicate that researchers should carefully consider the population(s) included in their sample and the implications it has on their interpretations of pairwise similarity estimates and resulting generalizability and reproducibility of estimates of network structures.

A Comparison of the Efficiency of Using a Deep CNN Approach with Other Common Regression Methods for the Prediction of EGFR Expression in Glioblastoma Patients,"To estimate epithermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression level in glioblastoma (GBM) patients using radiogenomic analysis of magnetic resonance images (MRI). A comparative study using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)â€“based regression, deep neural network, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, elastic net regression, and linear regression with no regularization was carried out to estimate EGFR expression of 166 GBM patients. Except for the deep CNN case, overfitting was prevented by using feature selection, and loss values for each method were compared. The loss values in the training phase for deep CNN, deep neural network, Elastic net, LASSO, and the linear regression with no regularization were 2.90, 8.69, 7.13, 14.63, and 21.76, respectively, while in the test phase, the loss values were 5.94, 10.28, 13.61, 17.32, and 24.19 respectively. These results illustrate that the efficiency of the deep CNN approach is better than that of the other methods, including Lasso regression, which is a regression method known for its advantage in high-dimension cases. A comparison between deep CNN, deep neural network, and three other common regression methods was carried out, and the efficiency of the CNN deep learning approach, in comparison with other regression models, was demonstrated.",2019,Journal of Digital Imaging
Current Topics and Events,"WE print in another part of this issue an article upon the position and prospects of the Zoological Station at Naples. The legal position of the Station has at last been denned by a statute, which according to the Gazzetta Ufficiale of Rome has been approved by decree. The Station is declared to be in ente morale (i.e. is legally constituted under government control, but accounts have to be kept according to government requirements, and certain privileges are enjoyed). The property known as Santo Pietro in Porto d'Ischia, comprising the land and house formerly owned by the heirs of Dr. A. Dohrn, and recently in chancery to the â€œDemanio dello Stato â€œby decree of April 10, 1921, is assigned with all rights to the ente morale. A capital fund of 250,000 lire is assigned to the ente morale for the service of the Station. This capital is raised by the sale of two properties, the farm of Settefondi in Forte dei Marmi in the province of Lucca, and the woods of Altofusco near Castello d'Ischia, formerly owned by the Dohrn heirs. The Demanio dello Stato is authorised to transfer these two properties to Prof. R. Dohrn for the said price of 250,000 lire. Following on the aforesaid arrangement, and with the agreement of the â€œComune â€œof Naples and of Dr. Dohrn, the Dohrn heirs are to have restored to them their property situate in the Via Francesco Crispi, formerly known as No. 92 Rione Amedeo, with all furniture therein. The Prefect of Naples is authorised to transfer the same to Dr. Dohrn. The income of the Zoological Station will be derived from (i) annual contributions from the Minister of Public Instruction, from the Thalassographic Committee, and from the â€œComune â€œof Naples; (2) contributions from public bodies and from Italian and foreign institutions; (3) fees for the letting of tables for research; (4) entrance fees to the aquarium, and from other sources. All the publications of the Zoological Station are to be issued in Italian form, but the contents may be in either Italian, French, English, or German, the four languages approved by the International Biological Congress. The internal administration of the Station will be under regulations approved by the Administrative Council and the Minister of Public Instruction. The research and administrative staff may be of any nationality, except the heads of departments, who must be Italian. A second and later statute refers to the composition of the Board which is to supervise the affairs of the Station, and o defines the position of Dr. Dohrn as director.",1924,Nature
Error bounds for the convex loss Lasso in linear models,"In this paper we investigate error bounds for convex loss functions for the Lasso in linear models, by first establishing a gap in the theory with respect to the existing error bounds. Then, under the compatibility condition, we recover bounds for the absolute value estimation error and the squared prediction error under mild conditions, which appear to be far more appropriate than the existing bounds for the convex loss Lasso. Interestingly, asymptotically the only difference between the new bounds of the convex loss Lasso and the classical Lasso is a term solely depending on a well-known expression in the robust statistics literature appearing multiplicatively in the bounds. We show that this result holds whether or not the scale parameter needs to be estimated jointly with the regression coefficients. Finally, we use the ratio to optimize our bounds in terms of minimaxity. MSC 2010 subject classifications: Primary 62F35; secondary 62J07.",2017,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Preoperative Prediction of Infection Stones Using Radiomics Features From Computed Tomography,"Preoperative prediction of infection stones from CT images could provide additional information for treatment planning. We developed a radiomics algorithm that could apply data from non-contrast-enhanced CT images to distinguish infection stones from non-infection stones. This retrospective study included 98 patients with clinically confirmed infection kidney stones and 59 patients with non-infection kidney stones. Fifty-four radiomics features extracted from CT images were reduced to 27 key features by the LASSO algorithm, for which a radiomics signature was built with ensemble learning based on bagged trees. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was then used to develop a radiomics nomogram incorporating the radiomics signature and independent clinical factors. The radiomics signature, which consisted of morphological features and textural features, was significantly associated with infection kidney stones. Ensemble learning based on bagged trees could differentiate infection kidney stones from non-infection kidney stones with 90.7% accuracy, 85.81% sensitivity, 93.96% specificity, a 91% positive predictive value and a 91% negative predictive value. Predictors incorporated into the individualized prediction nomogram included the radiomics signature, white blood cell count and urine culture. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the radiomics nomogram had potential clinical application for infection stone prediction.",2019,IEEE Access
"The IbatÃ© paleolake in SE Brazil: Record of an exceptional late Santonian palynoflora with multiple significance (chronostratigraphy, paleoecology and paleophytogeography)","Abstract The Cretaceous Bauru Group of the Parana Basin in Brazil is a widespread continental unit well known for its vertebrate and invertebrate fossiliferous content. The Sao Carlos Formation is an exception among its distinct and dominantly reddish siliciclastic units, which are otherwise devoid of palynomorphs. It includes an unique unit, the Ibate Bed, which corresponds to the lower interval of the Fazenda Nossa Senhora de Fatima Member (FNSF Mbr) and is represented by a dark grey organic silty-argillaceous rhythmite with a rich palynoflora. These rocks are the main focus of this study. Samples were collected from the type section of the formation that is located in the central area of the Sao Paulo State. Identified palynomorph types are as follows: 32 pteridophyte spore taxa, 31 gymnosperm pollen taxa and 64 angiosperm pollen taxa. Acritarchs, prasinophytes and phytoclasts were also recognized. Seven new taxa are proposed: Anacolosidites eosenonicus sp. nov., Leiosphaeridia ibateensis sp. nov., Stellatia gen. nov., Trichomites brevifurcatus gen. et sp. nov., Trichomites duplihelicoidus gen. et sp. nov., Trichomites simplex gen. et sp. nov. and Tricolpites joelcastroi sp. nov. In quantitative terms, the ephedroid pollen grains â€“ e.g., Equisetosporites , Gnetaceaepollenites and Steevesipollenites â€“ are predominant. Their occurrence associated with Classopollis grains suggest a warm climate tending towards dryness. Some levels are relatively rich in pteridophyte spores, suggestive of contribution from lakeside vegetation. The permanent presence of freshwater is attested by conspicuous microalgal remains ( Botryococcu s, Pediastrum , Staurastrum and prasinophycean phycomata), recognizable via fluorescence microscopy. Significant amounts of microalgal remains in some samples suggest episodic blooms in the lake, probably induced by eutrophication. The Ibate Bed corresponds to a depositional scenario involving a distal lacustrine environment with low-oxygen conditions in its bottom waters. As observed in offshore Brazilian basins, the presence of Anacolosidites eosenonicus sp. nov., combined with the absence of Steevesipollenites nativensis , indicates a late Santonian age for the bed (ca. 84 Ma). Other associated index-palynomorphs are compatible with this time assignment, which is reinforced by the presence of carbonized sclereids that are associated with the â€œGreat Santonian Wildfireâ€ recorded in coeval marine offshore strata of the Campos and Santos basins. The FNSF Mbr is stratigraphically related to the uppermost part of the Adamantina and Uberaba formations of the Bauru Group. Among all known Brazilian Late Cretaceous palynological continental records, this is the richest one ever detected. Although Late Cretaceous in age, the composition of the Ibate Bed palynoflora reflects better the mid Cretaceous ASA Paleophytogeographic Province.",2018,Cretaceous Research
Estimating growth and mortality rates from size data,"SummaryA method is presented for estimating rates of individual growth and population mortality utilizing average individual size at two times during a year. The model assumes a constant rate of mortality, Brody-Bertalanffy growth, a stationary age distribution, and recruitment confined to one month each year. A hypothetical example is presented to show the interrelationships of the growth and mortality constants, size at recruitment, asymptotic size and average individual size. Three examples are presented using data from the literature: Flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon), a sea urchin(Echinus esculentus), and the crown-of-thorns starfish(Acanthaster planci). The method appears to be a means of obtaining reasonable approximations of growth and mortality rates for a variety of organisms.",2005,Oecologia

High performance EEG feature extraction for fast epileptic seizure detection,"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects around 70 million people worldwide. Early detection of epileptic seizures has the potential to help patients in improving their quality of life. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used to record the brain's electrical activities associated with seizures. This paper presents a fast method for selecting EEG features that are relevant to early detection of epileptic seizures. The feature extraction model is based on LASSO regression and is applied to the EEG spectrum to recognize the EEG spectral features pertinent to seizures. These features are then selected and fed into a random forest (RF) classifier for epileptic seizure recognition. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed scheme achieves the highest detection performance of 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% classification accuracy, and 1.18 Sec detection delay. Furthermore, our model has proven to be robust in noisy and abnormal conditions.",2017,2017 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)
Corrosion Behaviour of British Magnox Waste Glass in Pure Water,The corrosion behaviour of Magnox Waste (MW) glass in deionized water has been investigated under the aegis of the Japanese-Swedish-Swiss (JSS) project. The studies carried out at PSI and BNFL included static leaching and corrosion layer characterization. The results were used by HMI to derive the modelling parameters for the MW glass with the PHREEQE/GLASSOL codes. The silica concentration was found to strongly influence the corrosion rate of the glass. The MW glass selectively retains Cs due to the formation of a Cs-Mg-Al-Si-O-rich layer on its surface.,1988,MRS Proceedings
