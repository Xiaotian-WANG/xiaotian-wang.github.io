The field of a particle in general relativity theory,"SummaryA time-dependent, spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein field equations for empty space is found. It can be regarded as describing the field of a particle in an empty expanding or contracting universe. The co-ordinatest andr have temporal and spatial character, respectively, both outside and inside the Schwarzschild sphere. Fort finite there is a real sngularity atr=0. The motion of a falling particle is investigated. In the limit of a static field one gets the Schwarzschild solution outside of this sphere, while insideg00 = 0, Â¦g11Â¦ = âˆž. This suggests that the inside of the Schwarzschild sphere is unphysical. Some speculations are presented on the final state of a star that has undergone gravitational collapse: it may involve a new state of matter, or there may be a three-dimensional timeless space inside it. The relation between the Schwarzschild an the Kruskal solutions is discussed.RiassuntoSi trova una soluzione dipendente dal tempo, a simmetria sferica delle equazioni di campo di Einstein per lo spazio vuoto, PuÃ’ essere considerata come una descrizione del campo di una particclla in un universo vuoto in espansione o in contrazione. Le coordinatet er hanno carattere temporale e spaziale, rispettivamente, sia fuori che dentro la sfera di Schwarzschild, Pert finito câ€™Ã¨ una singolaritÃ  reale per r = 0. Si studia il moto di una particella in caduta. Nel limite di un campo statico si ottiene la soluziono di Schwarzschild fuori da questa sfera, montre allâ€™interno g00= 0, Â¦g11Â¦âˆž. CiÃ’ suggerisce che Iâ€™interno della sfera di Schwarzschild Ã¨ non fisico. Si presentano alcune speculazioni sullo stato finale di una Stella che ha subito un collasso gravitazionalo : puÃ’ riguardare un nuovo stato della materia, o ci puÃ’ essore uno spazio senza tempo tridimensionale entro essa. Si discute la relazione tra le soluzioni di Schwarzschild e di Kruskal.Ð Ð•Ð¶Ð£ÐœÐ•ÐžÐ¿Ð Ð•Ð”Ð•Ð»ÑŒÐ•Ñ‚ÑÑŒ Ð¶ÐÐ’Ð˜ÑÑŒ Ð©Ð•Ð• ÐžÑ‚ Ð’Ð Ð•ÐœÐ•ÐÐ˜, ÑÐ¤Ð•Ð Ð˜Ð§Ð•ÑÐºÐ˜ ÑÐ˜ÐœÐœÐ•Ñ‚Ð Ð˜ Ð§ÐÑÐ• Ð Ð•ÑˆÐ•ÐÐ˜Ð• Ð¿ÐžÐ»Ð•Ð’Ñ‹Ñ… Ð£Ð ÐÐ’ÐÐ•ÐÐ˜Ð˜ ÐÐ˜ÐÑˆÑ‚Ð•Ð˜ÐÐ Ð”Ð»ÑŒ Ð¿Ð£ÑÑ‚ÐžÐ³Ðž Ð¿Ð ÐžÑÑ‚Ð ÐÐ ÑÑ‚Ð’Ð.

"Discovery of Schizaeoisporites from the Qumalai Basin,qinghai and Its Geological Significance","Terrigenous red beds overlying Jurassic and pre-Jurassic strata are widely distributed in northern Qinghai-Tibet plateau,and can provide geological and sedimentological information about the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.Due to the lack of fossil evidence,the geological age of these red beds have been disputed for a long time.Dating these red beds can provide very important data for understanding the geological history of the Tibet plateau.Here we report pollen fossils from red beds overlying Triassic strata in the Qumalai basin of southern Qinghai.A poorly preserved but geologically significant pollen flora was discovered from a calcilutite at the middle part of the very thick red beds.This gray calcilutite is widely distributed in the mountain basins in northern Qinghai-Tibet plateau,often used as a marker bed by field geologists for stratigraphic correlation.The palynological assemblage is dominated by various Schizaeoisporites forms,with a small amount of Ephedripites and Classopollis.It is be assigned to a Late Cretaceous age.The predominance of Schizaeoisporites with few humid plant pollens and spores in the flora indicates that there an arid climate dominated southern Qinghai in the Late Cretaceous.",2012,Journal of stratigraphy
Bearings fault diagnosis based on adaptive local iterative filteringâ€“multiscale permutation entropy and multinomial logistic model with group-lasso,"Bearing fault diagnosis attracts great attention because the bearing condition has direct effects on productivity and safety in industry. To accurately identify the operating condition of bearings, a novel bearing fault diagnosis method based on adaptive local iterative filteringâ€“multiscale permutation entropy and multinomial logistic model with group-lasso is first put forward in this article. In the proposed method, adaptive local iterative filtering was applied to decompose the nonlinear and non-stationary vibration signals into intrinsic mode functions. The multiscale permutation entropy values of the first several intrinsic mode functions were calculated to characterize the complexity of intrinsic mode functions in different scales, and they constructed feature vectors after normalization. Multinomial logistic model with group-lasso could perform multiple classifications with an embedded approach for feature selection, which is distinct from the traditional methods with two steps of dimensionality reduction and classification. Finally, the proposed method was verified with experiment data from Case Western Reserve University considering four conditions: different fault types, different damages, multiple types, and different loads. The results indicate that the proposed method is effective in identifying different categories of rolling bearings.",2019,Advances in Mechanical Engineering

A flexible framework for sparse simultaneous component based data integration,"Abstract1 BackgroundHigh throughput data are complex and methods that reveal structure underlying the data are most useful. Principal component analysis, frequently implemented as a singular value decomposition, is a popular technique in this respect. Nowadays often the challenge is to reveal structure in several sources of information (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) that are available for the same biological entities under study. Simultaneous component methods are most promising in this respect. However, the interpretation of the principal and simultaneous components is often daunting because contributions of each of the biomolecules (transcripts, proteins) have to be taken into account.2 ResultsWe propose a sparse simultaneous component method that makes many of the parameters redundant by shrinking them to zero. It includes principal component analysis, sparse principal component analysis, and ordinary simultaneous component analysis as special cases. Several penalties can be tuned that account in different ways for the block structure present in the integrated data. This yields known sparse approaches as the lasso, the ridge penalty, the elastic net, the group lasso, sparse group lasso, and elitist lasso. In addition, the algorithmic results can be easily transposed to the context of regression. Metabolomics data obtained with two measurement platforms for the same set of Escherichia coli samples are used to illustrate the proposed methodology and the properties of different penalties with respect to sparseness across and within data blocks.3 ConclusionSparse simultaneous component analysis is a useful method for data integration: First, simultaneous analyses of multiple blocks offer advantages over sequential and separate analyses and second, interpretation of the results is highly facilitated by their sparseness. The approach offered is flexible and allows to take the block structure in different ways into account. As such, structures can be found that are exclusively tied to one data platform (group lasso approach) as well as structures that involve all data platforms (Elitist lasso approach).4 AvailabilityThe additional file contains a MATLAB implementation of the sparse simultaneous component method.",2011,BMC Bioinformatics
Sex differences in mortality among young children in the Sahel.,"""This article studied sex differences in mortality among children aged 1-23 months in the cities of Bamako [Mali] and Bobo-Dioulasso [Burkina Faso] and in a rural area of Senegal. No significant differences between male and female mortality risks were found in any of the areas for the full age span of 1-23 months. For smaller age groups, patterns of excess female and male child mortality are evident. Excess female mortality, statistically significant in standard tests, exists among children aged 1-8 months in the Senegalese area and 6-15 months in the combined urban areas of Bamako and Bobo-Dioulasso. Excess male mortality occurs for ages 16-23 months in the city of Bamako.""",1995,Population bulletin of the United Nations
Construction of Quantitative Index System of Vocabulary Difficulty in Chinese Grade Reading,"Chinese grade reading for children has a broad application prospect. In this paper, Chinese textbooks for grade 1 to 6 of primary schools published by Peopleâ€™s Education Press are taken as data sets, and the texts are divided into 12 difficulty levels successively. The effective lexical indexes to measure the readability of texts are discussed, and a regression model to effectively measure the lexical difficulty of Chinese texts is established. The study firstly collected 30 indexes at the text lexical level from the three dimensions of lexical richness, semantic transparency and contextual dependence, selected the 7 indexes with the highest relevance to the text difficulty through Person correlation coefficient, and finally constructed a Regression to predict the text difficulty based on Lasso Regression, ElasticNet, Ridge Regression and other algorithms. The regression results show that the model fits well, and the predicted value could explain 89.3% of the total variation of text difficulty, which proves that the quantitative index of vocabulary difficulty of Chinese text constructed in this paper is effective, and can be applied to Chinese grade reading and computer automatic grading of Chinese text difficulty.",2019,2019 International Conference on Asian Language Processing (IALP)
Report for CSE 5339 2018 â€” ( OTMLSA ) Optimal Transport in Machine Learning and Shape Analysis Stochastic Optimization for Large-scale Optimal Transport ( OT ),"Optimal transport (OT) problem is the problem of finding the optimal map of transportation between two distributions, and OT defines a powerful framework to compare probability distributions in a geometrically faithful way. [1]. Due to its generality, OT has been applied in many fields of computer sciences, such as the classification of multi-label outputs [2], bag of word-embedding [3] and reflectance interpolation, color transfer, and geometry processing [4]. In Previous works, many different methods had been proposed to solve OT problem. In 1942, Kantorovitch invented Kantorovitch formulation to compute OT problem [7], which can be solved with Network flow solvers [8]. Recently, to smooth the distance estimation of OT problem and make the OT problem convex and more stable, some regularized methods were proposed, such as entropic regularization and group lasso.[6],[9]. Based on entropic regularization, Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm was proposed to solve this problem [6]. However, these methods are purely discrete and cannot cope with continuous densities. In previous work, the only known class of methods that can overcome this limitation are so-called semi-discrete solvers [10]. In addition, the practical impact of OT is still limited because of its computational burden. Therefore, to deal with the large-scale OT problems, this report will introduce a stochastic optimization for large-scale optimal transport [5]. To be specific, three kinds of stochastic optimization methods are introduced to cope with three possible settings in this report:",2018,
Inference in High-dimensional Dynamic Panel Data Models,"We establish oracle inequalities for a version of the Lasso in high-dimensional fixed effects dynamic panel data models. The inequalities are valid for the coefficients of the dynamic and exogenous regressors. Separate oracle inequalities are derived for the fixed effects. Next, we show how one can conduct simultaneous inference on the parameters of the model and construct a uniformly valid estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix which is robust to conditional heteroskedasticity in the error terms. Allowing for conditional heteroskedasticity is important in dynamic models as the conditional error variance may be non-constant over time and depend on the covariates. Furthermore, our procedure allows for inference on high-dimensional subsets of the parameter vector of an increasing cardinality. We show that the confidence bands resulting from our procedure are asymptotically honest and contract at the optimal rate. This rate is different for the fixed effects than for the remaining parts of the parameter vector.",2014,
Statistica Sinica Preprint No : SS-2018-0075 Title The Broken Adaptive Ridge Procedure and Its Applications,"In this paper, we study the broken adaptive ridge method to estimate lower-dimensional patterns of coefficients in regression models. Based on the re-weighted `2-penalization, the new method can simultaneously recover both the true sparsity and the inherent structures of the features, which makes it theoretically and practically appealing. The resulting estimate is shown to enjoy the oracle property. The proposed method also contains a set of variable selection or pattern estimation methods. As a special case, the fused broken adaptive ridge, which penalizes the differences between adjacent coefficients, is thoroughly discussed with applications in signal approximation and image processing. The associated algorithms are numerically easy to implement. Various simulation studies and real data analyses illustrate its advantages over the fused lasso method.",2018,
Unipolar signal modification as a guide for lesion creation during radiofrequency application in the left atrium: prospective study in humans in the setting of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation catheter ablation.,"BACKGROUND
In patients treated for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection rate is substantial and may be related to the lack of transmurality achievement while performing PV isolation (PVI). It has been experimentally demonstrated that positive unipolar atrial electrogram completion, when applying radiofrequency energy, was associated with transmural lesions. In this regard, we seek to determine whether the unipolar signal modification may be an appropriate end point for point-by-point radiofrequency application and find out whether it could improve the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation results in humans.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Fifty consecutive patients (61Â±8 years old, 41 men) with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation underwent PVI using Carto and Lasso. Each radiofrequency application lasted until development of a completely positive unipolar electrogram. Fifty patients (63Â±9 years old, 40 men), who previously underwent PVI following the standard approach of our institution, corresponded to the control group. All PVs were isolated in all patients of both groups. However, the procedural and ablation times were significantly lower in the unipolar group compared with those of the control group, whereas the PV reconnection rate, after 30 minutes of waiting time, was not significantly different. Overall, 21Â±4 months after 1 PVI session, the sinus rhythm maintenance rate without antiarrhythmic drugs was significantly higher (P=0.027) in the unipolar group (88%) compared with that of the control group (70%).


CONCLUSIONS
Unipolar signal modification is a useful end point for radiofrequency energy delivery in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who undergo PVI and leads to a substantial midterm sinus rhythm maintenance rate.",2013,Circulation. Arrhythmia and electrophysiology
A hybrid dynamic Bayesian network approach for modelling temporal associations of gene expressions for hypertension diagnosis,"Computational and machine learning techniques have been applied in identifying biomarkers and constructing predictive models for diagnosis of hypertension. Strategies such as improved classification rules based on decision trees have been proposed. Other techniques such as Fuzzy Expert Systems (FES) and Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (NFS) have recently been applied. However, these methods lack the ability to detect temporal relationships among biomarker genes that will aid better understanding of the mechanism of hypertension disease. In this paper we apply a proposed two-stage bio-network construction approach that combines the power and computational efficiency of classification methods with the well-established predictive ability of Dynamic Bayesian Network. We demonstrate our method using the analysis of male young-onset hypertension microarray dataset. Four key genes were identified by the Least Angle Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and three Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) methods. Results show that cell regulation FOXQ1 may inhibit the expression of focusyltransferase-6 (FUT6) and that ABCG1 ATP-binding cassette sub-family G may also play inhibitory role against NR2E3 nuclear receptor sub-family 2 and CGB2 Chromatin Gonadotrophin.",2014,2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society

Statistical Analysis of High-Dimensional Data for Pancreatic Cancer,"Abstract Pancreatic cancer is a highly malignant disease with a five-year survival rate less than 5%. Advances in modern data collection technology have revolutionized the way that we study the complex biological systems, allowing pancreatic cancer researchers to make genome-wide expression profiling within tumors in a fast, precise, and cost-effective way. How to correctly analyze and interpret the high-dimensional and complex gene expression data is a key to understanding the hidden regulatory mechanisms. In this work, we first introduce a LASSO penalized Cox regression method to identify individual genes that are directly related to survival time of pancreatic cancer patients. A cyclic coordinate descent algorithm is used for the computation of high-dimensional data (number of genes larger than number of patients). Then, we introduce a doubly regularized Cox regression method, which integrates pathway information into our analysis, to identify both genes and signaling pathways related to pancreatic cancer survival. Both methods are applied to a pancreatic cancer microarray dataset and identify several genes and signaling pathways correlated to pancreatic cancer survival. Our findings can help cancer researchers design new strategies for the early detection and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.",2014,
A voxel selection method for the multivariate analysis of imaging genetics data,We suggest a multivariate genotype-phenotype association test for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The method uses a voxel selection and ranking scheme based on iterative adaptive Lasso for defining a functional region of interest. A classifier-based test is used to assess the significance of potential associations between the differential activity pattern within that region and a set of candidate genetic variants. We applied the method to a small sample dataset from an ongoing imaging genetics study and identified a significant genetic association to a stimulus-locked imaging phenotype.,2012,The 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)
The Numerical Delta Method and Bootstrap âˆ—,"This paper studies inference on nondifferentiable functions using methods based on numerical differentiation. First we show that for an appropriately chosen sequence of step sizes, numerical derivative based delta methods provide consistent inference for functions of parameters that are directionally differentiable. Examples of directionally differentiable functions arise in a variety of economic applications such as moment inequalities models and threshold regression models. Second, we propose a numerical bootstrap method that provides asymptotically valid inference even for parameters that are not known to be directionally differentiable. The numerical bootstrap can consistently estimate the limiting distribution in many cases where the conventional bootstrap is known to fail and where subsampling has been the most commonly used inference approach. Applications include constrained and unconstrained M-estimators converging at both regular and nonstandard rates, misspecified simulated GMM models with nondifferentiable moments, LASSO, and 1-norm Support Vector Machine regression.",2016,
Recovering Causal Networks based on Windowed Granger Analysis in Multivariate Time Series,"Reconstruction of causal network from multivariate time series is an important problem in data science. Regular causality analysis based on Granger method does not consider multiple delays between elements of a causal network. In contrast, the Windowed Granger method not only considers the effect of mutiple delays, but also provides a flexible framework to utilize various linear and nonlinear regression methods within Granger causality analysis. In this work, we have used four methods with Windowed Granger method including hypothesis tests of linear regression, LASSO and random forest. Then, their performance on two simulated and real-world time series are compared with ground truth networks and other causality recovering methods.",2019,2019 9th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)
Fast Source Reconstruction for Bioluminescence Tomography Based on Sparse Regularization,"Bioluminescence tomography (BLT) is an inherent ill-posed inverse problem to reconstruct the internal source in 3-D with limited measurements on the external surface. In most BLT studies so far, a relatively small permissible source region or multispectral approach is typically used to enhance the stability or quality of the solution. In this letter, considering the sparsity characteristic of the light source, BLT is reformulated as a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) problem with l1 regularization, and then, a fast reconstruction algorithm named as stagewise fast LASSO is proposed for solving this problem. Numerical simulations of a 3-D mouse atlas under different noise levels demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust against measurement noise, and it can achieve high computational efficiency and accurate localization of source even without any permissible region constraint.",2010,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering
Time evolution of a density discontinuity in the one-dimensional gravitational gas,"Classical time-dependent perturbation theory is applied to the Vlassov-Poisson equations describing the one-dimensional gravitational gas. The initial conditions are an initial Maxwellian velocity distribution and a stepfunction discontinuity. It is shown that on top of the usual free-particle diffusion - smoothing out the initial density discontinuity - a density pulse and a counter-pulse propagate away from the original discontinuity. The results suggest that initial density discontinuities can seed the formation of inhomogeneities in the evolution of a collisionless one-dimensional gravitational gas, a result which should be verified in three dimensions, to study the formation of inhomogeneities in galactic dynamics",1993,Astronomy and Astrophysics
The Sanctuary at Zindan MaÄŸarasÄ± in the Light of the New Archaeological Evidence,"The excavation at Zindan Magarasi (cave) began in 2002, under the direction of the Isparta Museum directorate. During the 2002 campaign a mosaic floor was unearthened upon which the head of the God Eurymedon is depicted. During excavations in front of the cave a wall from the second century A.D. and a wall dating from the third century A.D. were discovered. The authors suggest that the former could be a temenos wall while the latter wall could have been a platform, while the apse wall of a chapel, built from spolien was found in the same locality. These excavations supplied considerable architectural material that will help to identify the architectural character of this sanctuary. The excavations in front of the cave exposed a long period of occupation, extending from the Early Hellenistic to the Seljuk Period. In 2003 two important inscriptions were found showing that the temple in front of the cave was dedicated to Meter Theon Veginos. Nevertheless, the evidence obtained both from the excavations and the survey in the vicinity show that the cult centre in front of the cave was dedicated to at least three gods: Zeus, Cybele and Eurymedon. From the finds of coins from Sagalassos, Perge, Selge and Antiocheia from within the excavated area and the fact that this sanctuary was located by an important road connection, it can be suggested that the cult centre had local, but was also of regional importance. The monastery church built upon the hill facing the cave shows that the religious character of the site was maintained for centuries.",2005,
Graphical Lasso Granger Method with 2-Levels-Thresholding for Recovering Causality Networks,"The recovery of the causality networks with a number of variables is an important problem that arises in various scientific contexts. For detecting the causal relationships in the network with a big number of variables, the so called Graphical Lasso Granger (GLG) method was proposed. It is widely believed that the GLG-method tends to overselect causal relationships. In this paper, we propose a thresholding strategy for the GLG-method, which we call 2-levels-thresholding, and we show that with this strategy the variable overselection of the GLG-method may be overcomed. Moreover, we demonstrate that the GLG-method with the proposed thresholding strategy may become superior to other methods that were proposed for the recovery of the causality networks.",2013,
Central and peripheral body fat distribution: Different associations with low-grade inflammation in young adults?,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Evidence regarding the impact of regional body fat distribution on low-grade inflammation is limited. The current study examined the association of central and peripheral body fat distribution and low-grade inflammation levels in young adults, considering collinearity between variables.


METHODS AND RESULTS
A cross-sectional analysis of 809 adults (aged 27 years) was conducted as part of the EPITeen cohort, Porto, Portugal. Regional body fat was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (DXA) and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured in a fasting blood sample. OLS (ordinary least squares) and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression models were fitted to estimate the association of trunk and peripheral fat with hsCRP, stratified by sex. Using OLS regression, trunk fat in females was positively associated with ln(hsCRP) (Î²1Â =Â 0.064, 95% CI 0.018; 0.109). The effect of peripheral fat on ln(hsCRP) was shown not to be significantly different from trunk fat (Î²2Â =Â -0.011, 95% CI -0.110; 0.089), but no statistically significant association was observed (Î²3Â =Â 0.053, 95% CI -0.004; 0.110) between peripheral fat and ln(hsCRP). In males, trunk fat also showed a positive association with ln(hsCRP) (Î²1Â =Â 0.104, 95% CI 0.055; 0.154), and the effect of peripheral fat on ln(hsCRP) was shown to be significantly different from trunk fat (Î²2Â =Â -0.124, 95% CI -0.237;-0.011). However, the association between peripheral fat and ln(hsCRP) did not reach statistical significance (Î²3Â =Â -0.020, 95% CI -0.086; 0.046). The results of OLS were confirmed by LASSO regression.


CONCLUSION
A higher fat deposited in the trunk was positively associated with hsCRP, whereas no statistically significant effect was observed for peripheral fat.",2019,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD"
A systematic reassessment and paleogeographic review of fossil Xenarthra from Peru,"A revision of Peruvian Xenarthra and the discovery of new specimens have increased our knowledge of the Order in this country. About thirty sites from three geographic regions, Amazonian Forest, the Andes, and the coast have yielded Xenarthra in Peru. The only well known Pre-Pleistocene Xenarthra is Thalassocnus from the Mio-Pliocene of the Pisco Formation. Pleistocene Phyllophaga (Megatheriidae, Nothrotheriidae, Mylodontidae, and Megalonychidae) and Cingulata (Pampatheriidae and Glyptodontidae) are rare in the Amazonian forest region, abundant in the coastal region and are particularly frequent in the Andes (between 2Â 500 and 4Â 500 meters). Cingulata are not as diverse and are represented only by Holmesina cf. paulacoutoi along the coast and Glyptodon clavipes in the Andes. The mylodontid Glossotherium sp. is recognized in the entire Peruvian coast and the scelidothere Scelidodon chiliensis is abundant in both the Andes and northern coast region. Pleistocene nothrotheres are found only in the Amazonian forest region (Nothropus priscus in Rio Acre). Megatheriidae are well diversified and have an extended geographic range. The tropical genus Eremotherium (E. laurillardi) is present on the northern coast and is possibly represented in Amazonia by a gigantic form. The temperate genus Megatherium is represented in Peru by a small-sized, quadrupedal, and browser of the Andean linage of the subgenus M. (Pseudomegatherium), which includes M. (P.) tarijense, M. (P.) elenense, M. (P.) urbinai, and new species from the northern Andes. Large species of sloths such as Megatherium (Megatherium) americanum, Lestodon sp., and Scelidotherium leptocephalum that are typical of the Argentinian Pampas are absent in Peru. A peculiar new megalonychid was discovered in the north coast region (Cupisnique desert) and in the Andes near Lake Titicaca at Casa del Diablo cave. 14C dating indicates that most of fossil mammals in Peru are Lujanian in age. Along the coast and probably in Amazonia, Xenarthra are found in open localities, in contrast to the Andean region in which most specimens are preserved in caves. In Peru, and all over South America, large Xenarthra did not survive beyond the beginning of the Holocene.",2004,
Intrinsic bioremediation potential of a chronically polluted marine coastal area.,"A microbiological survey of the Priolo Bay (eastern coast of Sicily, Ionian Sea), a chronically polluted marine coastal area, was carried out in order to discern its intrinsic bioremediation potential. Microbiological analysis, 16S rDNA-based DGGE fingerprinting and PLFAs analysis were performed on seawater and sediment samples from six stations on two transects. Higher diversity and variability among stations was detected by DGGE in sediment than in water samples although seawater revealed higher diversity of culturable hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. The most polluted sediment hosted higher total bacterial diversity and higher abundance and diversity of culturable HC degraders. Alkane- and PAH-degrading bacteria were isolated from all stations and assigned to Alcanivorax, Marinobacter, Thalassospira, Alteromonas and Oleibacter (first isolation from the Mediterranean area). High total microbial diversity associated to a large selection of HC degraders is believed to contribute to natural attenuation of the area, provided that new contaminant contributions are avoided.",2015,Marine pollution bulletin
A study of gestational diabetes,"Diabetes mellitus is a growing problem, especially in developing countries. People suffering from diabetes have an increased risk of developing a number of serious health problems. Consistently high blood glucose levels can lead to serious diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels, eyes, kidney, etc. In addition, people with diabetes also have a higher risk of developing infections. This paper aims to use suitable data mining and classification techniques which include the Logit model, the Probit model, the Classification tree technique, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Ridge Regression technique and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in order to determine the best method which can be used to classify the patients as suffering from gestational diabetes or not. The misclassification rate is calculated for different methods and the method having the least misclassification rate is said to be the most suitable to be applied to the given data, which is the PIMA Indians diabetes dataset.",2019,bioRxiv
Lanczos Biconjugate A-Orthonormalization Methods for Surface Integral Equations in Electromagnetism,"Abstract| We present a novel class of Krylov projection methods computed from the Lanczosbiconjugate A-Orthonormalization algorithm for the solution of dense complex non-Hermitianlinear systems arising from the Method of Moments discretization of electromagnetic scatter-ing problems expressed in an integral formulation. Their competitiveness with other popularKrylov solvers, especially when memory is a concern, is illustrated on a set of model problemsrepresentative of realistic radar-cross section calculations. The results presented in this studywill contribute to assess the potential of iterative Krylov methods for solving electromagneticscattering problems from large structures and to enrich the database of this technology.1. INTRODUCTION In the last decades, the development of boundary element methods (BEM) for solving electromag-netic (EM) scattering problems in two and three dimensions is receiving a vigorous impulse. BEMsolvers are computationally attractive because they require a simple description of the surface of thetarget by means of triangular facets simplifying considerably the mesh generation especially in thecase of moving objects. The Method of Moments (MoM) discretization of integral equations leads tothe solution of large dense linear systems of equations that are often ill-conditioned. For solving suchsystems, iterative Krylov algorithms can be a valid alternative to dense direct methods, providedthey are combined with the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) [6,11] to carry outapproximate matrix by vector products (M-V), and with suitable preconditioners. Many integralformulations for surface scattering and hybrid surface/volume discretizations yield non-Hermitianlinear systems that cannot be solved using the Conjugate Gradient (CG) algorithm. The General-ized Minimal Residual method (GMRES) [9] and its variant Flexible GMRES (FGMRES) [8] arebroadly used in application codes due to their proved robustness and smooth convergence, see e.g.,experiments reported in [1,6] for solving very large boundary element equations involving milliondiscretization points. On the other hand, iterative methods based on Lanczos biconjugation, suchas the BiConjugate Gradient Stabilized method (BiCGSTAB) [11] and the Quasi-Minimal Residualmethod (QMR) [2] can be cheaper in terms of memory demands but they may require many moreiterations to converge especially on realistic geometries [1,7]. In this paper we present a novel classof Krylov projection methods based on the recently developed Lanczos A-orthonormalization pro-cedure for solving dense complex non-Hermitian linear systems arising from the MoM discretizationof EM scattering problems expressed in an integral formulation. The ï¬‚rst solver is named Biconju-gate A-Orthogonal Residual (BiCOR). Two variants of BiCOR are also considered, which do notrequire multiplication by the Hermitian of",2010,Piers Online
Estimating the error variance in a high-dimensional linear model,"The lasso has been studied extensively as a tool for estimating the coefficient vector in the high-dimensional linear model; however, considerably less is known about estimating the error variance. Indeed, most well-known theoretical properties of the lasso, including recent advances in selective inference with the lasso, are established under the assumption that the underlying error variance is known. Yet the error variance in practice is, of course, unknown. In this paper, we propose the natural lasso estimator for the error variance, which maximizes a penalized likelihood objective. A key aspect of the natural lasso is that the likelihood is expressed in terms of the natural parameterization of the multiparameter exponential family of a Gaussian with unknown mean and variance. The result is a remarkably simple estimator with provably good performance in terms of mean squared error. These theoretical results do not require placing any assumptions on the design matrix or the true regression coefficients. We also propose a companion estimator, called the organic lasso, which theoretically does not require tuning of the regularization parameter. Both estimators do well compared to preexisting methods, especially in settings where successful recovery of the true support of the coefficient vector is hard.",2017,Biometrika
Evaluation of metabolite-microbe correlation detection methods.,"Different correlation detection methods have been specifically designed for the microbiome data analysis considering the compositional data structure and different sequencing depths. Along with the speedy development of omics studies, there is an increasing interest in discovering the biological associations between microbes and host metabolites. This raises the need of finding proper statistical methods that facilitate the correlation analysis across different omics studies. Here, we comprehensively evaluated six different correlation methods, i.e., Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, Sparse Correlations for Compositional data (SparCC), Correlation inference for Compositional data through Lasso (CCLasso), Mutual Information Coefficient (MIC), and Cosine similarity methods, for the correlations detection between microbes and metabolites. Three simulated and two real-world data sets (from public databases and our lab) were used to examine the performance of each method regarding its specificity, sensitivity, similarity, accuracy, and stability with different sparsity. Our results indicate that although each method has its own pros and cons in different scenarios, Spearman correlation and MIC outperform the others with their overall performances. A strategic guidance was also proposed for the correlation analysis between microbe and metabolite.",2019,Analytical biochemistry
Antarctic petrels â€˜on the ice rocksâ€™: wintering strategy of an Antarctic seabird,"There is a paucity of information on the foraging ecology, especially individual use of sea-ice features and icebergs, over the non-breeding season in many seabird species. Using geolocators and stable isotopes, we defined the movements, distribution and diet of adult Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica from the largest known breeding colony, the inland Svarthamaren, Antarctica. More specifically, we examined how sea-ice concentration and free-drifting icebergs affect the distribution of Antarctic petrels. After breeding, birds moved north to the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the Weddell sector of the Southern Ocean, following its northward extension during freeze-up in April, and they wintered there in Aprilâ€“August. There, the birds stayed predominantly out of the water (60â€“80% of the time) suggesting they use icebergs as platforms to stand on and/or to rest. Feather Î´15N values encompassed one full trophic level, indicating that birds fed on various proportions of crustaceans and fish/squid, most likely Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and the myctophid fish Electrona antarctica and/or the squid Psychroteuthis glacialis. Birds showed strong affinity for the open waters of the northern boundary of the MIZ, an important iceberg transit area, which offers roosting opportunities and rich prey fields. The strong association of Antarctic petrels with sea-ice cycle and icebergs suggests the species can serve, year-round, as a sentinel of environmental changes for this remote region.",2020,Royal Society Open Science

Phytochemistry and Ethnopharmacology of the Sea Grass Cymodoceacea Familyâ€“ a Review,"Cymodoceaceae is a family of flowering plants, sometimes known as the â€œmanatee-grass family,â€ the family Cymodoceaceae includes only marine species. The angiosperm phylogeny II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), does recognize Cymodoceaceae and places it in the order Alismatales, in the clade monocots. They are marine hydrophytes that grow and complete their life cycle in a submerged condition, in a saline environment. Like terrestrial plant they obtain their energy from light through photosynthesis thus, they grow only in clear and shallow water, and at the suitable condition, they form beds or meadows. The family includes five genera, totalling 16 species of marine plants occurring in tropical seas and oceans (so-called seagrasses). Cymodoceaceae consist of five genera such as Amphibolis, Cymodocea, Halodule, Syringodium, and Thalassodendron. In this genera Cymodocea rotundata Ehrenb. and Hempr. Ex Asch. Cymodocea serrulata, (R.Br.) Asch. and Magnus, Halodule pinifolia (Miki) Hartog, Halodule uninervis (Forssk.)

Data-adaptive additive modeling.,"In this paper, we consider fitting a flexible and interpretable additive regression model in a data-rich setting. We wish to avoid pre-specifying the functional form of the conditional association between each covariate and the response, while still retaining interpretability of the fitted functions. A number of recent proposals in the literature for nonparametric additive modeling are data adaptive, in the sense that they can adjust the level of flexibility in the functional fits to the data at hand. For instance, the sparse additive model makes it possible to adaptively determine which features should be included in the fitted model, the sparse partially linear additive model allows each feature in the fitted model to take either a linear or a nonlinear functional form, and the recent fused lasso additive model and additive trend filtering proposals allow the knots in each nonlinear function fit to be selected from the data. In this paper, we combine the strengths of each of these recent proposals into a single proposal that uses the data to determine which features to include in the model, whether to model each feature linearly or nonlinearly, and what form to use for the nonlinear functions. We establish connections between our approach and recent proposals from the literature, and we demonstrate its strengths in a simulation study.",2019,Statistics in medicine
A new strategy of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator coupled with sampling error profile analysis for wavelength selection,"Abstract A new strategy based on sampling error profile analysis (SEPA) combined with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (SEPA-LASSO) was proposed. LASSO has been proven to be effective for multivariate calibration with automatic variable selection for high-dimensional data. However, in the previous research, the critical process of multivariate calibration by LASSO was an optimization of 1-norm turning parameter for a fixed sample set without considering the behaviors of variable selection by different subsets of samples. In the present work, Monte Carlo Sampling (MCS), the core of SEPA framework, is used to investigate various sub-models. Least angle regression (LAR) is used to solve LASSO, and various LAR iteration including certain number of variables could be obtained instead of choosing the numerical values of 1-norm turning parameters. SEPA-LASSO algorithm consists of plenty of loops. Under the SEPA framework and LAR algorithm, a number of LASSO sub-models with the same dimensions are built by MCS in each loop, the vote rule is used to determine the importance of variables and select them to build variable subsets. After running the loops, several subsets of variables are obtained and their error profile is used to choose the optimal subset of variables. The performance of SEPA-LASSO was evaluated by three near-infrared (NIR) datasets. The results show that the model built by SEPA-LASSO has excellent predictability and interpretability, compared with some commonly used multivariate calibration methods, such as principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS), as well as some wavelength selection methods including LASSO, moving window partial least squares regression (MWPLSR), Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination (MC-UVE), ordered homogeneity pursuit lasso (OHPL) and stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (SCARS).",2018,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems
Single Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals Heterogeneity of Human MSC Chondrogenesis: Lasso Regularized Logistic Regression to Identify Gene and Regulatory Signatures,"Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit the potential to undergo chondrogenesis in vitro, forming de novo tissues with a cartilage-like extracellular matrix that is rich in glycosaminoglycan and collagen type II. However, it is now apparent that MSCs comprise an inhomogeneous population of cells, and the fate of individual subpopulations during this differentiation process is not well understood. We analyzed the trajectory of MSC differentiation during chondrogenesis using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Using a machine learning technique â€“ lasso regularized logistic regression â€“ we showed that multiple subpopulations of cells existed at all stages during MSC chondrogenesis and were better-defined by transcription factor activity rather than gene expression. Trajectory analysis indicated that subpopulations of MSCs were not intrinsically specified or restricted, but instead remained multipotent and could differentiate into three main cell types: cartilage, hypertrophic cartilage, and bone. Lasso regularized logistic regression showed several advances in scRNA-seq analysis, namely identification of a small number of highly influential genes or transcription factors for downstream validation, and cell type classification with high accuracy. Additionally, we showed that MSC differentiation trajectory may exhibit donor to donor variation, although key influential pathways were comparable between donors. Our data provide an important resource to study gene expression and to deconstruct gene regulatory networks in MSC differentiation.",2019,bioRxiv
Causal influences of brain metabolic activity reveal interregional progressions in normal aging,"Abstract During healthy brain aging, different brain regions show anatomical or functional declines at different rates, and some regions may show compensatory increases in functional activity. However, few studies have explored interregional influences of brain activity during the aging process. We proposed a causality analysis framework combining high dimensionality independent component analysis (ICA), Granger causality, and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression on longitudinal brain metabolic activity data measured by Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). We analyzed FDG-PET images from healthy old subjects, who were scanned for at least five sessions with an averaged intersession interval of about one year. The longitudinal data were concatenated across subjects to form a time series, and the first order autoregressive model was used to measure interregional causality among the independent sources of metabolic activity identified using ICA. Several independent sources with reduced metabolic activity in aging, including the anterior temporal lobe and orbital frontal cortex, demonstrated causal influences over many widespread brain regions. On the other hand, the influenced regions were more distributed, and had smaller age related declines or even relatively increased metabolic activity. The current data demonstrated interregional spreads of aging on metabolic activity at the scale of a year, and have identified key brain regions in the aging process that have strong influences over other regions.",2018,bioRxiv
Continuous-time discrete-space models for animal movement,"The processes influencing animal movement and resource selection are complex and varied. Past efforts to model behavioral changes over time used Bayesian statistical models with variable parameter space, such as reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches, which are computationally demanding and inaccessible to many practitioners. We present a continuous-time discrete-space (CTDS) model of animal movement that can be fit using standard generalized linear modeling (GLM) methods. This CTDS approach allows for the joint modeling of location-based as well as directional drivers of movement. Changing behavior over time is modeled using a varying-coefficient framework which maintains the computational simplicity of a GLM approach, and variable selection is accomplished using a group lasso penalty. We apply our approach to a study of two mountain lions (Puma concolor) in Colorado, USA.",2015,The Annals of Applied Statistics

Single center experience with femoral extraction of permanent endocardial pacing leads.,"Between March 1995 and June 1997, 128 leads were extracted from the hearts of 28 women and 50 men, 69 +/- 15 years of age (mean +/- SD, range 22-92 years). The indications for the procedure were: Accufix leads in 18 patients (14%), dysfunction or incompatibility with ICD in 16 (12%), endocarditis on the lead in 41 (32%), pulse generator pocket infection in 28 (22%), and pulse generator and/or lead erosion in 25 patients (19%). The extraction was performed with a snare (lasso), via a femoral vein as a first approach in 116 leads, and as an alternate approach, after extraction from the original site of implantation had failed, in 12 leads. The leads had been implanted for 62 +/- 48 months (range 1-205 months). A Cook sheath was used in 7, and a femoral approach traction in 20 instances. Of the 128 leads, 122 (95%) were completely extracted, and 2 (2%) were partially extracted (the distal electrode remaining attached to the myocardium), and 4 (3%) could not be removed. Four complications occurred: 2 tears of the tricuspid valve without clinical consequences, one separation of the lead's distal electrode which migrated into the hypogastric vein, and one hemorrhage at the femoral puncture site. There was no death or serious complication caused by lead extraction in this series.",1999,Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE
Predictive performance of genomic selection methods for carcass traits in Hanwoo beef cattle: impacts of the genetic architecture,"BackgroundHanwoo beef is known for its marbled fat, tenderness, juiciness and characteristic flavor, as well as for its low cholesterol and high omega 3 fatty acid contents. As yet, there has been no comprehensive investigation to estimate genomic selection accuracy for carcass traits in Hanwoo cattle using dense markers. This study aimed at evaluating the accuracy of alternative statistical methods that differed in assumptions about the underlying genetic model for various carcass traits: backfat thickness (BT), carcass weight (CW), eye muscle area (EMA), and marbling score (MS).MethodsAccuracies of direct genomic breeding values (DGV) for carcass traits were estimated by applying fivefold cross-validation to a dataset including 1183 animals and approximately 34,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).ResultsAccuracies of BayesC, Bayesian LASSO (BayesL) and genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) methods were similar for BT, EMA and MS. However, for CW, DGV accuracy was 7% higher with BayesC than with BayesL and GBLUP. The increased accuracy of BayesC, compared to GBLUP and BayesL, was maintained for CW, regardless of the training sample size, but not for BT, EMA, and MS. Genome-wide association studies detected consistent large effects for SNPs on chromosomes 6 and 14 for CW.ConclusionsThe predictive performance of the models depended on the trait analyzed. For CW, the results showed a clear superiority of BayesC compared to GBLUP and BayesL. These findings indicate the importance of using a proper variable selection method for genomic selection of traits and also suggest that the genetic architecture that underlies CW differs from that of the other carcass traits analyzed. Thus, our study provides significant new insights into the carcass traits of Hanwoo cattle.",2016,"Genetics, Selection, Evolution : GSE"
Group sparse optimization for learning predictive state representations,"Abstract Predictive state representations (PSRs) are a commonly used approach for agents to summarize the information from history generated during their interaction with a dynamical environment and the agents may use PSRs to predict the future observation. Existing works have shown the benefits of PSRs for modelling partially observable dynamical systems. One of the key issues in PSRs is to discover a set of tests for representing states, which is called core tests. However, there is no very efficient technique to find the core tests for a large and complex problem in practice. In this paper, we formulate the discovering of the set of core tests as an optimization problem and exploit a group sparsity of the decision-making matrix to solve the problem. Then the PSR parameters can be obtained simultaneously. Hence, the model of the underlying system can be built immediately. The new learning approach doesnâ€™t require the specification of the number of core tests. Furthermore, the embedded optimization method for solving the considered group Lasso problem, called alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), can achieve a global convergence. We conduct experiments on three problem domains including one extremely large problem domain and show promising performances of the new approach.",2017,Inf. Sci.
CORR InsightsÂ®: What is the Association Between Hospital Volume and Complications After Revision Total Joint Arthroplasty A Large-database Study,"Ricciardi and colleagues [11] performed a large-database study of 29,948 inpatient stays at NewYork hospitals to examine the relationship between revision total hip and knee arthroplasty volume and complications after surgery. The authors found that 90-day readmission rates were lower in the highest-volume centers compared to lower-volume hospitals, whereas reoperation rates within the first 90 days were not different when higherand lower-volume settings were compared. Postoperative complication rates were higher among only the lowest-volume (quartile 1) institutions, and the authors found no association between 30-day mortality and hospital volume. These results suggest that regionalizing revision total joint arthroplasty (TJA) services away from the lowest-quartile hospitals may reduce 90-day readmissions and early complications rates. Their study focuses on two important topics: (1) Volume-outcome relationships after revision TJA, and (2) the regionalization of revision arthroplasty services. Regarding the correlation between hospital volume and outcomes, there are studies that find no correlation [2, 10], but another study found that adhering to standardized process of care measures can lead to improved quality of care independent of hospital or even surgeon volume [1]. High-volume hospitals have been associated with a lower risk of complications (and sometimes even of death after surgery) for a wide range of surgical procedures, and studies [4-6] about both primary and revision arthroplasty suggest that this applies to those operations as well. I note, though, one study evaluating implant survivorship found no relationship between that endpoint and higher hospital volume (though it did find that reconstructive survivorship was greater when the arthroplasty was performed by highervolume surgeons) [2]. The other issue of interest here is the potential regionalization of revision TJA services based on hospital volumes, whereby patients might be referred to the highest-volume hospitals in the region. Regionalized primary TJA may reduce early readmissions and postoperative complications [3], but we lack sufficient evidence to advocate widespread implementation of regionalization of revision TJA. Ricciardi and colleagues [11] also point out a number of serious operational hurdles associated with this kind of regionalization. Internationally, Jeschke and colleagues [5] in Germany and Glassou and colleagues [4] in a population-based study within the Nordic arthroplasty register association database made strong recommendations about regionalization to hospitals with higher volume TKA and THA patients (more than 50 patients per year) to reduce the overall revision and complication rates.

WEâ€Aâ€301â€03: Enhancement of Fourâ€Dimensional Coneâ€Beam Computed Tomography by Compressed Sensing with Bregman Iteration,"Purpose: In fourâ€dimensional (4D) coneâ€beam computed tomography(CBCT), there is a spatioâ€temporal tradeoff. The aim of this study is to develop a Bregman iteration based formalism for high quality 4D CBCTimage reconstruction from lowâ€dose projections. Methods: The 4D CBCT problem is first divided into multiple 3D CBCT subproblems by grouping the projection images corresponding to the phases. To maximally utilize the information from the underâ€sampled projection data, a compressed sensing method is employed for solving each subproblem. We formulate an unconstrained lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) problem based on leastâ€square criterion regularized by totalâ€variation. The leastâ€square criterion reflects the inconsistency between the measured and the estimated line integrals. Furthermore, the unconstrained lasso problem is updated and solved repeatedly by Bregman iterations. Results: The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a series of phantom experiments, and the results are compared to those of conventional filtered backâ€projection (FBP). The simulation studies have shown that artifact suppressed images can be obtained with as small as 41 projections per phase, which is adequate for clinical 4D CBCTreconstruction without slowing down the gantry rotation. With such small number of projections, the conventional FBP failed to yield meaningful 4D CBCTimages. Conclusions: The proposed method significantly reduces the radiation dose and scanning time to achieve the high quality images compared to the conventional 4D CBCTimaging based on FBP technique.",2011,Medical Physics
Shrinkage estimation for linear regression with ARMA errors,"Abstract In this paper, we extend the modified lasso of Wang et al. (2007) to the linear regression model with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) errors. Such an extension is far from trivial because new devices need to be called for to establish the asymptotics due to the existence of the moving average component. A shrinkage procedure is proposed to simultaneously estimate the parameters and select the informative variables in the regression, autoregressive, and moving average components. We show that the resulting estimator is consistent in both parameter estimation and variable selection, and enjoys the oracle properties. To overcome the complexity in numerical computation caused by the existence of the moving average component, we propose a procedure based on a least squares approximation to implement estimation. The ordinary least squares formulation with the use of the modified lasso makes the computation very efficient. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of the procedure. An empirical example of ground-level ozone is also provided.",2012,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference
Inverse Sparse Group Lasso Model for Robust Object Tracking,"Sparse representation has been applied to visual tracking. The visual tracking models based on sparse representation use a template set as dictionary atoms to reconstruct candidate samples without considering similarity among atoms. In this paper, we present a robust tracking method based on the inverse sparse group lasso model. Our method exploits both the group structure of similar candidate samples and the local structure between templates and samples. Unlike the conventional sparse representation, the templates are encoded by the candidate samples, and similar samples are selected to reconstruct the template at the group level, which facilitates inter-group sparsity. Every sample group achieves the intra-group sparsity so that the information between the related dictionary atoms is taken into account. Moreover, the local structure between templates and samples is considered to build the reconstruction model, which ensures that the computed coefficients similarity is consistent with the similarity between templates and samples. A gradient descent-based optimization method is employed and a sparse mapping table is obtained using the coefficient matrix and hash-distance weight matrix. Experiments were conducted with publicly available datasets and a comparison study was performed against 20 state-of-the-art methods. Both qualitative and quantitative results are reported. The proposed method demonstrated improved robustness and accuracy and exhibited comparable computational complexity.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia
The Impact of Evil Social Forces on Lower-Level Governments,"The erosion by evil forces to grass-root governments is mainly shown in the following:establishing another â€œpower centerâ€ and partitioning local governments; resisting the enforcement of law with violence and interfering with the normal functions of government; lassoing government officials and decaying grass-root political power; and manipulating elections with violence or threats to seize local power.

En los ultimos anos comienza a renovarse, pero requiere de mas novedades, desde la captacion de mayor diversidad de usuarios, incluidos extranjeros, a la difusion de enclaves y diversificacion hacia actividades complementarias. Entre estas ultimas esta el turismo cultural, en trayecto hacia destino o desde este. Para ello se cuenta con las intenciones institucionales, y con un legado patrimonial de indudable atractivo. Son las razones, junto a ejemplos implantados que ya muestran resultados, que permiten el diseno de una ruta que complementa las variantes turisticas de salud y cultural. Parte de un area de turismo mayoritario de sol y playa, que incluye talasoterapia, para recorrer los enclaves balnearios de interior emplazados en dos provincias, y ofrece el atractivo de un notable patrimonio natural valioso, y de otro material muy diversificado, herencia de la compleja historia regional. EnglishHealth tourism in Spain is much localized. Also in the spanish peninsular southeast. In recent years, health tourism begins to renew their infrastructure, but requires more renewals, from acquisition of greater diversity of users, including foreigners, to the dissemination of enclaves and diversification into complementary activities. Among these activities is the cultural tourism. Administrative institutions and Government are trying to improve and promote a patrimonial legacy of undoubted appeal. There are implanted examples of tourism diversification (routes that complement the tourist variants of health and cultural) which already show good results. This paper proposes a new tourist route that starts from an area of sun and beach tourism (dominantly in the southeast of Spain), which includes thalassotherapy centers, and continues to visit the inland spas in two provinces (Murcia and Albacete). This tour offers the attraction of a valuable natural and cultural heritage, legacy of the complex regional history.",2014,
Sparsity-driven anomaly detection for ship detection and tracking in maritime video,"This work examines joint anomaly detection and dictionary learning approaches for identifying anomalies in persistent surveillance applications that require data compression. We have developed a sparsity-driven anomaly detector that can be used for learning dictionaries to address these challenges. In our approach, each training datum is modeled as a sparse linear combination of dictionary atoms in the presence of noise. The noise term is modeled as additive Gaussian noise and a deterministic term models the anomalies. However, no model for the statistical distribution of the anomalies is made. An estimator is postulated for a dictionary that exploits the fact that since anomalies by definition are rare, only a few anomalies will be present when considering the entire dataset. From this vantage point, we endow the deterministic noise term (anomaly-related) with a group-sparsity property. A robust dictionary learning problem is postulated where a group-lasso penalty is used to encourage most anomaly-related noise components to be zero. The proposed estimator achieves robustness by both identifying the anomalies and removing their effect from the dictionary estimate. Our approach is applied to the problem of ship detection and tracking from full-motion video with promising results.",2015,
Assessment of Genome-wide Prediction by Using Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks,"GLÃ“RIA, Leonardo Siqueira, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de ViÃ§osa, May, 2015 . Assessment of genome-wide prediction by using Bayesian regularized neural networks. Adviser: Fabyano Fonseca e Silva. Co-Advisers: Cosme DamiÃ£o Cruz and Ricardo Augusto MendonÃ§a Vieira. Recently there is an increase interest to use nonparametric methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANN). In animal breeding, an especial class of ANN called Bayesian Regularized Neural Network (BRNN) has been preferable since it not demands a priori knowledge of the genetic architecture of the characteristic as assumed by the most used parametric methods (RR-BLUP, Bayes A, B, C ï¿½, BLASSO). Although BRNN has been shown to be effective for genomic enable prediction. The aim of the present study was to apply the ANN based on Bayesian regularization to genome-enable prediction regarding simulated data sets, to select the most relevant SNP markers by using two proposed methods, to estimate heritabilities for the considered traits, and to compare the results with two traditional methods (RR-BLUP and BLASSO). The simplest Bayesian Regularized Neural Network (BRNN) model gave consistent predictions for both traits, which were similar to the results obtained from the traditional RR-BLUP and BLASSO methods. The SNP importance identification methods based on BRNN proposed here showed correlation values (0.61 and 0.81 for traits 1 and 2, respectively) between true and estimated marker effects higher than the traditional BLASSO (0.55 and 0.71, respectively for traits 1 and 2) method. With respect to h 2 estimates (assuming 0.35 as true value), the simplest BRNN recovered 0.33 for both traits, thus outperforming the RR-BLUP and BLASSO, that, in average, estimated h 2 equal to 0.215.",2015,

Robust Linear Regression Using L1-Penalized MM-Estimation for High Dimensional Data,"Large datasets, where the number of predictors p is larger than the sample sizes n, have become very popular in recent years. These datasets pose great challenges for building a linear good prediction model. In addition, when dataset contains a fraction of outliers and other contaminations, linear regression becomes a difficult problem. Therefore, we need methods that are sparse and robust at the same time. In this paper, we implemented the approach of MM estimation and proposed L1-Penalized MM-estimation (MM-Lasso).

An MM-Based Algorithm for  ${\ell }_{1}$ -Regularized Least-Squares Estimation With an Application to Ground Penetrating Radar Image Reconstruction,"An estimation method known as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) or â„“1-regularized LS estimation has been found to perform well in a number of applications. In this paper, we use the majorize-minimize method to develop an algorithm for minimizing the LASSO objective function, which is the sum of a linear LS objective function plus an â„“1 penalty term. The proposed algorithm, which we call the LASSO estimation via majorization-minimization (LMM) algorithm, is straightforward to implement, parallelizable, and guaranteed to produce LASSO objective function values that monotonically decrease. In addition, we formulate an extension of the LMM algorithm for reconstructing ground penetrating radar (GPR) images, that is much faster than the standard LMM algorithm and utilizes significantly less memory. Thus, the GPR specific LMM (GPR-LMM) algorithm is able to accommodate the big data associated with GPR imaging. We compare our proposed algorithms to the state-of-the-art â„“1-regularized LS algorithms using a time and space complexity analysis. The GPR-LMM greatly outperforms the competing algorithms in terms of the performance metrics we considered. In addition, the reconstruction results of the standard LMM and GPR-LMM algorithms are evaluated using both simulated and real GPR data.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing
LASSO vector autoregression structures for very short-term wind power forecasting,"The deployment of smart grids and renewable energy dispatch centers motivates the development of forecasting techniques that take advantage of near real-time measurements collected from geographically distributed sensors. This paper describes a forecasting methodology that explores a set of different sparse structures for the vector autoregression (VAR) model using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) framework. The alternating direction method of multipliers is applied to fit the different VAR-LASSO variants and create a scalable forecasting method supported by parallel computing and fast convergence, which can be used by system operators and renewable power plant operators. A test case with 66 wind power plants is used to show the improvement in forecasting skill from exploring distributed sparse structures.

[Radiofrequency catheter ablation of permanent atrial fibrillation under guidance of Carto merge technique].,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the effectiveness and advantages of the Carto merge technique in guiding radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of permanent atrial fibrillation (AF).


METHODS
A total of 15 patients with permanent AF underwent RFCA under guidance of the Carto merge technique. The virtual electroanatomical map of the left atrium (LA) and pulmonary veins (PVs) were reconstructed with Carto system during the procedure. Then the electroanatomical map was integrated with 3-D images of cardiac magnetic resonance angiography to form Carto merge map. Circumferential pulmonary vein ablation was performed first until complete PVs electric isolation confirmed by lasso catheter. If AF was not terminated, lesion lines on roof of LA, mitral isthmus, and tricuspid isthmus were produced. Finally direct current (DC) cardioversion were given if sinus rhythm did not return.


RESULTS
AF were terminated spontaneously during RFCA in 2 patients, and by DC cardioversion in the remaining 13 patients. Persistent AF recurred on 24 hours, first week, and 5th week, respectively in three patients. The remaining 12 patients were all free of AF during follow-up (1-10 months). The success rate was 80% in the study.


CONCLUSIONS
Carto merge technique can effectively guide RFCA of permanent AF. When combined with single Lasso mapping, it can simplify the mapping and enhance the success rate of RFCA of permanent AF.",2007,Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao. Acta Academiae Medicinae Sinicae
Genetic risk factors identified in populations of European descent do not improve the prediction of osteoporotic fracture and bone mineral density in Chinese populations,"Aiming to investigate whether genetic risk factors (GRFs) for fracture and bone mineral density (BMD) identified from people of European descent can help improve the prediction of osteoporotic fracture (OF) risk and BMD in Chinese populations, we built assessment models for femoral neck (FN)-fracture prediction and BMD value prediction using 700 elderly Chinese Han subjects and 1,620 unrelated Chinese Han subjects, respectively. 17 fracture-associated genes and 82 FN-BMD associated genes identified in people of European descent were used to build a logistic regression model with clinical risk factors (CRFs) for FN-fracture prediction in Chinese. Meanwhile 107 BMD-associated genes from people of European descent were used to build a multiple linear regression model with CRFs for BMD prediction in Chinese. A Lasso algorithm was employed for informative SNP selection to construct the genetic risk score (GRS) with ten-fold cross-validation. The results showed that, adding fracture GRF and FN-BMD GRF to the model with CRFs, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) decrease from 0.653 to 0.587 and 0.588, respectively, for FN fracture prediction. 62.3% and 61.8% of the risk variation were explained by the Model with CRFs and fracture GRF and by the Model with CRFs and FN-BMD GRF, respectively, as compared to 65.5% in the Model with CRFs only. The net reclassification improvement (NRI) index in the reclassification analysis is 0.56% (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.57) and 1.13% (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.29), respectively. There is no significant difference either between the performance of the model with CRFs and that of the model with both CRFs and GRF for BMD prediction. We concluded that, in the current study, GRF of fracture identified in people of European descent does not contributes to improve the fracture prediction in Chinese; and GRF of BMD from people of European descent cannot help improve the accuracy of the fracture prediction in Chinese perhaps partially because GRF of BMD from people of European descent may not contribute to BMD prediction in Chinese. This study highlights the limited utility of the current genetics studies largely focused on people of European descent for disease or risk factor prediction in other ethnic groups, and calls for more and larger scale studies focused on other ethnic groups.",2019,Scientific Reports
Winter aggregations of marine mammals and birds in the north-eastern Weddell Sea pack ice,"SummaryA seabird and mammal census was carried out in the north-eastern Weddell Sea during the austral winter of 1986. The German research icebreaker Polarstern operated in heavy pack ice along the Greenwich Meridian between the northern sea ice boundary and the Antarctic coast. Crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus), minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), AdÃ©lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica) and snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) were found to be more abundant in the vicinity of the submarine Maud Rise, about 700 km north of the continental margin, than in other areas of substantial ice cover traversed during that cruise. The aggregations of birds and mammals are expected to reflect aggregations of their principal food, krill (Euphausia superba) wintering underneath the ice cover. The distribution pattern of krill predators coincides with the course of a warm water belt upwelling near Maud Rise. This upwelling could induce local ice melting which in turn may result in an increased release of sea ice algae.",2004,Polar Biology
Orexin-A Rescues Chronic Copper-Dependent Behavioral and HSP90 Transcriptional Alterations in the Ornate Wrasse Brain,"Recently, orexin (ORX)ergic system has gained great attention for its major neuroregulatory role on fish motor, circadian, feeding activities and above all during water toxic conditions. Fish are particularly sensitive to acute sublethal copper (Cu) concentrations while little is known about neurobehavioral data after chronic Cu exposure. For this work, the marine teleost ornate wrasse (Thalassoma pavo) was monitored for 21Â days during exposure to a relatively low CuCl2 concentration (0.25Â mg/l). In particular, at 1Â day fish displayed moderate reductions (âˆ’32%) of feeding behaviors versus controls that decreased up to âˆ’94% at 21Â days. Swimming activities were also moderately (âˆ’44%) reduced at 1Â day, which diminished even further (~ âˆ’75%) from 7 to 21Â days. The lethargic attitudes seemed to be frequently interrupted by aquatic surface respiration and abnormal motor behaviors such as rapid and abrupt changes of direction. Contextually, an upregulatory trend of HSP90 mRNAs occurred especially in the lateral part of the dorsal telencephalon (Dl; +72%), medial preglomerular nucleus (NPGm; +87%), and torus longitudinalis (TLo; +108%). Moreover, some of these nuclei displayed extensive argyrophilic signals that are typical of notable neurodegenerative events. Interestingly, a single intraperitoneal administration of ORX-A (10Â ng/g of body weight) at 21Â days attenuated not only some behavioral impairments but also HSP90 mRNA levels and neurodegenerative events. Behavioral indications of the present results tend to underlie the valuable role of HSP90 transcript together with the ORXergic system as probable rescuing factors operating in marine fish during persistent adverse environmental states with eventual bearings on human health issues.",2017,Neurotoxicity Research
Could interleukin-17 be a therapeutic target of steroid-dependent minimal change disease?,"To the Editor: We read with great interest the recent contribution by Munyentwali et al.1 They evaluated the efficacy and safety of rituximab treatment in adult patients with steroid-dependent minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). They suggested two possible hypotheses: B cells have a potential role in the pathophysiology of MCNS or rituximab stabilizes the cytoskeleton of podocytes. The commentary of Glassock2 shows that more factors could take an important role in the pathogenesis of MCNS such as local factors generated by interleukin (IL)-13, regulatory T cell, and he thought that the T cells affected by B cells might be the source of permeability factor of MCNS. However, we would like to add another possible mechanism of rituximab on steroid-dependent MCNS.",2013,Kidney International
Monitoraggio ecografico dellâ€™ovulazione nella cagna: risultati preliminari,"RIASSUNTO Gli autori descrivono la loro esperienza inerente il monitoraggio ecografico dellâ€™ovulazione in sei cagne. I reperti ecografici sono stati interpretati correlandoli con la colpocitologia e il dosaggio del progesterone ematico durante le fasi di proestro ed estro. Durante la fase preovulatoria lâ€™ovaia appare ovoidale e contiene strutture rotondeggianti anecogene (follicoli), nel periodo postovulatorio diventa bozzellata per la presenza di strutture ipoecogene (corpi lutei) che sporgono dalla sua superficie. In nessun caso e stato possibile osservare il collasso dei follicoli durante lâ€™ovulazione. Poiche e stata osservata una correlazione significativa tra lâ€™aumento preovulatorio del progesterone plasmatico e lâ€™ispessimento della parete follicolare (luteinizzazione preovulatoria), gli autori ritengono che lâ€™ecografia possa costituire un valido ausilio nella determinazione del momento dellâ€™ovulazione nella cagna. SUMMARY The authors describe their experience about ultrasonographic monitoring of ovulation in six bitches. Ultrasonographic findings were correlated with colpocitology and progesterone plasma concentration during proestrus and estrus. During the preovulatory period ovary is ovoidal-shaped and contains anechoic structures (follicles); after ovulation, the presence of hypoechogenic structures (corpora lutea) protruding above the surface of the ovary makes the ovarian profile irregular. Follicular collapse was not detected during ovulation. Because a significant correlation between preovulatory elevation of plasma progesterone levels and follicular wall thickening (preovulatory luteinization) was observed, the authors assume that ultrasonography might be a useful tool in timing ovulation in bitches.",2001,
"Predictors for Anastomotic Leak, Postoperative Complications, and Mortality After Right Colectomy for Cancer: Results From an International Snapshot Audit","Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. BACKGROUND: A right hemicolectomy is among the most commonly performed operations for colon cancer, but modern high-quality, multination data addressing the morbidity and mortality rates are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study reports the morbidity and mortality rates for right-sided colon cancer and identifies predictors for unfavorable short-term outcome after right hemicolectomy. DESIGN: This was a snapshot observational prospective study. SETTING: The study was conducted as a multicenter international study. PATIENTS: The 2015 European Society of Coloproctology snapshot study was a prospective multicenter international series that included all patients undergoing elective or emergency right hemicolectomy or ileocecal resection over a 2-month period in early 2015. This is a subanalysis of the colon cancer cohort of patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predictors for anastomotic leak and 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed using multivariable mixed-effect logistic regression models after variables selection with the Lasso method. RESULTS: Of the 2515 included patients, an anastomosis was performed in 97.2% (n = 2444), handsewn in 38.5% (n = 940) and stapled in 61.5% (n = 1504) cases. The overall anastomotic leak rate was 7.4% (180/2444), 30-day morbidity was 38.0% (n = 956), and mortality was 2.6% (n = 66). Patients with anastomotic leak had a significantly increased mortality rate (10.6% vs 1.6% no-leak patients; p > 0.001). At multivariable analysis the following variables were associated with anastomotic leak: longer duration of surgery (OR = 1.007 per min; p = 0.0037), open approach (OR = 1.9; p = 0.0037), and stapled anastomosis (OR = 1.5; p = 0.041). LIMITATIONS: This is an observational study, and therefore selection bias could be present. For this reason, a multivariable logistic regression model was performed, trying to correct possible confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Anastomotic leak after oncologic right hemicolectomy is a frequent complication, and it is associated with increased mortality. The key contributing surgical factors for anastomotic leak were anastomotic technique, surgical approach, and duration of surgery. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B165.

"Spa treatment for primary fibromyalgia syndrome: a combination of thalassotherapy, exercise and patient education improves symptoms and quality of life.","OBJECTIVES
To study the effect of a combination of thalassotherapy, exercise and patient education in people with fibromyalgia.


METHODS
Patients with fibromyalgia, selected from a rheumatology out-patient department and from members of the Dutch fibromyalgia patient association, were pre-randomized to receive either 2(1/2) weeks of treatment in a Tunisian spa resort, including thalassotherapy, supervised exercise and group education (active treatment) or treatment as usual (control treatment). Primary outcome measure was health-related quality of life, measured with the RAND-36 questionnaire. Secondary measures included the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, tender point score and a 6-min treadmill walk test.


RESULTS
Fifty-eight participants receiving the active treatment reported significant improvement on RAND-36 physical and mental component summary scales. For physical health, differences from the 76 controls were statistically significant after 3 months, but not after 6 and 12 months. A similar pattern of temporary improvement was seen in the self-reported secondary measures. Tender point scores and treadmill walk tests improved more after active treatment, but did not reach significant between-group differences, except for walk tests after 12 months.


CONCLUSIONS
A combination of thalassotherapy, exercise and patient education may temporarily improve fibromyalgia symptoms and health-related quality of life.",2005,Rheumatology
Judith Haendeler and Stefanie Dimmeler Inseparably Tied : Functional and Antioxidative Capacity of Endothelial Progenitor Cells,"New blood vessel formation is required to increase blood supply to the myocardium or other tissues after critical ischemia. Capillary formation after ischemia can be achieved by the sprouting of preexisting vessels, a process named angiogenesis. However, in the last few years it has become evident that bone marrowâ€“derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can contribute to and amplify neovascularization. EPCs significantly contribute to adult vessel formation by physically incorporating and promoting vessel growth by paracrine mechanisms.1 Injected EPCs improve neovascularization of ischemic hind limbs and ischemic hearts in animal models (for review see reference 2). Moreover, initial clinical trials demonstrate that the infusion or injection of bone marrowâ€“derived or circulating progenitor cells augment perfusion and increase the ejection fraction in patients with ischemic heart disease (for review see reference 3). To contribute to tissue repair, EPCs, and stem cells in general, have to be equipped with antioxidative defense systems to survive in necrotic and ischemic tissues. Interestingly, a high resistance to oxidative stress has been considered a characteristic feature of stem cells.4,5 Protection against oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species is accomplished by a complex defense system composed of several antioxidative enzymes that reduce the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species (for review see reference 6). The most vulnerable organelles to oxidative stress are the mitochondria, because of the permanent potential for the production of superoxide anions. Superoxide anions are converted to hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutases, whereas hydrogen peroxide is detoxified by the enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Because of the localization of manganese superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) in the matrix of the mitochondria, in close proximity to the production of reactive oxygen species by the electron transport chain, these two enzymes are believed to be the primary antioxidant defense systems in the mitochondria. Recently, two in vitro studies demonstrated that EPCs express higher levels of manganese superoxide dismutase and GPx-1.7,8 In this issue of Circulation Research, Galasso et al addressed for the first time the role of one of the antioxidative enzymes, namely GPx-1, for the functional capacity of EPCs in vivo.9 The authors of this study investigated ischemia-induced neovascularization in GPx-1â€“deficient mice and assessed the number and functional activity of EPCs. GPx-1â€“deficient mice showed a reduced blood flow recovery after hindlimb ischemia compared with their wildtype littermates. This was accompanied by reduced EPC levels in response to ischemic injury, or to VEGF administration, and a reduction of the functional capacity of EPCs to migrate and promote angiogenesis in vitro.9 These novel findings support the knowledge that EPCs require antioxidative enzymes, specifically GPx-1, for their functional capacity (for summary see the Figure). However, is the reduction of EPCs in GPx-1â€“deficient mice caused by increased cell death or decreased differentiation or mobilization? Galasso et al demonstrated that EPCs derived from GPx-1â€“deficient mice show increased apoptosis sensitivity and decreased expression of the endothelial marker Flk-1. At first glance one could surmise that both processesâ€”increased apoptosis sensitivity and decreased expression of Flk-1â€”are involved in the reduction of EPC levels from GPx-1â€“deficient mice. However, a reduced Flk-1 expression was demonstrated before and after ischemia, supporting the hypothesis that interfering with the antioxidant defense systems of cells may influence differentiation. Likewise, the increase in EPC numbers after ischemia or VEGF was inhibited, indicating an influence on mobilization. In contrast, the basal apoptosis rate is similar in EPCs derived from wild-type and from GPx-1â€“deficient mice, despite the fact that the EPCs were isolated after ischemia. Only after treatment with H2O2 were EPCs derived from GPx-1â€“deficient mice more prone to apoptosis. Overall, these data would suggest that apoptosis may not be the most important mechanism for reduced EPC levels. What is the specific mechanism by which reactive oxygen species affect mobilization and progenitor cell differentiation toward the endothelial lineage? Although the molecular mechanisms are unknown so far, one may speculate that the reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide reported for the GPx-1â€“deficient mice10 may contribute to the phenotype of the mice. It is also important to note that eNOS-deficient mice show a similarly impaired capacity to mobilize EPCs combined with a systemic dysfunction of isolated EPCs.11,12 One important issue to note is the dual role of reactive oxygen species. Although reactive oxygen species in high concentrations are toxic, low levels of reactive oxygen species can serve as intracellular signals stimulating mechanisms that prevent tissue injury and promote angiogenesis.13 In line with these findings, Tojo et al demonstrated that ischemia-induced neovascularization is impaired in mice lacking a subunit of the NADPH oxidase, the gp91.14 Thus, reactive oxygen species from inflammatory cells, as well as from endothelial cells, appear to be essential to the complete development of angiogenesis in response to ischemia. In contrast, Galasso et al demonstrated here that an increase in reactive oxygen species in EPCs from GPx-1â€“deficient mice results in a functional impairment of these cells, and GPx-1â€“deficient mice show a selective sensitivity toward different types of oxidative stress.15,16 Further studies addressing the specific impact of different The opinions expressed in this editorial are not necessarily those of the editors or of the American Heart Association.

Stacked Regression and Poststratification,"I develop a procedure for estimating local-area public opinion called stacked regression and poststratification (SRP), a generalization of classical multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP). This procedure employs a diverse ensemble of predictive modelsÃ¢â‚¬â€including multilevel regression, LASSO, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and gradient boostingÃ¢â‚¬â€to improve the cross-validated fit of the first-stage predictions. In a Monte Carlo simulation, SRP significantly outperforms MRP when there are deep interactions in the data generating process, without requiring the researcher to specify a complex parametric model in advance.

Suicide risk configuration system in a clustered clinical sample: a generalized linear model obtained through the LASSO technique,"OBJECTIVE
To identify clinical and sociodemographic factors that increase or decrease suicidal risk in a clinical sample of subjects seeking mental health care.


METHOD
A cross-sectional study was performed at three health centers in Santiago, Chile. The Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), Depressive Experience Questionnaire (DEQ), Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45.2), Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL), and State Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI-2), in addition to a sociodemographic survey, were applied to 544 participants (333 with suicidal behavior and 211 without current suicidal behavior). Through hierarchical clustering analysis, participants were grouped by similarity regarding suicidal risk. Then, a regression analysis was performed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) technique, and factors that decrease or increase suicide risk (SR) were identified for each cluster.


RESULTS
The resultant clusters were grouped mainly by the age of participants. The most important protective factor was having confidence in one's own coping skills in difficult situations. Relevant risk factors were major depressive disorder (MDD), poor anger management, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships.


CONCLUSIONS
Suicidal risk manifests differently throughout the life cycle, and different types of bonds may protect from or increase risk of suicide.",2019,Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria
The role of pionic currents in gamma emission during nuclear encounters,"Abstract A review of experimental data on Nucleus-Nucleus-Gamma reactions is given. Spectra display an exponential shape above 30 MeV, with an almost linear variation of the exponential parameter with incident beam energy. The laboratory angular distributions show strong forward peaking, as well as a remarkable insensitivity to the mass ratios of target and projectile. Transformed into the nucleon-nucleon center of mass, these angular distributions display forward backward symmetry. They are mostly isotropic, with a slight admixture of a dipole component. In first approximation, the intensity of the spectra appear to be proportional to the number of first nucleon-nucleon collisions, which leads to a simple scaling law. Exclusive measurements display an interesting correlation between the hardness of the spectra and the centrality of the collision. Experimental results put stringent constraints on theoretical models. The scaling laws appear to contradict the prediction of collective models where both nuclei behave like entities. The angular distributions do not seem to be easily reconciled with emission by thermal sources. Semi-classical dynamical calculations of the BUU or Landau-Vlassov type, where the collision term is the source of incoherent photon emission, have been used extensively to reproduce the experimental results. These calculations were able to reproduce most of the experimental features. Photon emission in Nucleus-Nucleus collisions is, thus, intimately related to that occuring in the elementary n-p reaction. Recent measurements and calculations show that most of the photon production is, in this case, related to the charged pion exchange between the two nucleons. Therefore, Nucleus-Nucleus collisions may be a unique probe of the exchange currents in hot and dense nuclear matter.",1992,Nuclear Physics
Regularized Least Squares Temporal Difference Learning with Nested â„“2 and â„“1 Penalization,"The construction of a suitable set of features to approximate value functions is a central problem in reinforcement learning (RL). A popular approach to this problem is to use high-dimensional feature spaces together with least-squares temporal difference learning (LSTD). Although this combination allows for very accurate approximations, it often exhibits poor prediction performance because of overfitting when the number of samples is small compared to the number of features in the approximation space. In the linear regression setting, regularization is commonly used to overcome this problem. In this paper, we review some regularized approaches to policy evaluation and we introduce a novel scheme (L 21 ) which uses l2 regularization in the projection operator and an l1 penalty in the fixed-point step. We show that such formulation reduces to a standard Lasso problem. As a result, any off-the-shelf solver can be used to compute its solution and standardization techniques can be applied to the data. We report experimental results showing that L 21 is effective in avoiding overfitting and that it compares favorably to existing l1 regularized methods.",2011,
PItcHPERFeCT: Primary Intracranial Hemorrhage Probability Estimation using Random Forests on CT,"INTRODUCTION
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), where a blood vessel ruptures into areas of the brain, accounts for approximately 10-15% of all strokes. X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning is largely used to assess the location and volume of these hemorrhages. Manual segmentation of the CT scan using planimetry by an expert reader is the gold standard for volume estimation, but is time-consuming and has within- and across-reader variability. We propose a fully automated segmentation approach using a random forest algorithm with features extracted from X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans.


METHODS
The Minimally Invasive Surgery plus rt-PA in ICH Evacuation (MISTIE) trial was a multi-site Phase II clinical trial that tested the safety of hemorrhage removal using recombinant-tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). For this analysis, we use 112 baseline CT scans from patients enrolled in the MISTE trial, one CT scan per patient. ICH was manually segmented on these CT scans by expert readers. We derived a set of imaging predictors from each scan. Using 10 randomly-selected scans, we used a first-pass voxel selection procedure based on quantiles of a set of predictors and then built 4 models estimating the voxel-level probability of ICH. The models used were: 1) logistic regression, 2) logistic regression with a penalty on the model parameters using LASSO, 3) a generalized additive model (GAM) and 4) a random forest classifier. The remaining 102 scans were used for model validation.For each validation scan, the model predicted the probability of ICH at each voxel. These voxel-level probabilities were then thresholded to produce binary segmentations of the hemorrhage. These masks were compared to the manual segmentations using the Dice Similarity Index (DSI) and the correlation of hemorrhage volume of between the two segmentations. We tested equality of median DSI using the Kruskal-Wallis test across the 4 models. We tested equality of the median DSI from sets of 2 models using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.


RESULTS
All results presented are for the 102 scans in the validation set. The median DSI for each model was: 0.89 (logistic), 0.885 (LASSO), 0.88 (GAM), and 0.899 (random forest). Using the random forest results in a slightly higher median DSI compared to the other models. After Bonferroni correction, the hypothesis of equality of median DSI was rejected only when comparing the random forest DSI to the DSI from the logistic (p < 0.001), LASSO (p < 0.001), or GAM (p < 0.001) models. In practical terms the difference between the random forest and the logistic regression is quite small. The correlation (95% CI) between the volume from manual segmentation and the predicted volume was 0.93 (0.9,0.95) for the random forest model. These results indicate that random forest approach can achieve accurate segmentation of ICH in a population of patients from a variety of imaging centers. We provide an R package (https://github.com/muschellij2/ichseg) and a Shiny R application online (http://johnmuschelli.com/ich_segment_all.html) for implementing and testing the proposed approach.",2017,NeuroImage : Clinical

"Recent Advances on Variability, Morpho-Functional Adaptations, Dental Terminology, and Evolution of Sloths","The occasion of the Xenarthra Symposium during the ICVM 9 meeting allowed us to reflect on the considerable advances in the knowledge of sloths made by the â€œX-communityâ€ over the past two decades, particularly in such aspects as locomotion, mastication, diet, dental terminology, intraspecific variation, sexual dimorphism, and phylogenetic relationships. These advancements have largely been made possible by the application of cladistic methodology (including DNA analyses) and the discovery of peculiar forms such as Diabolotherium, Thalassocnus, and Pseudoglyptodon in traditionally neglected areas such as the Chilean Andes and the Peruvian Pacific desert coast. Modern tree sloths exhibit an upside-down posture and suspensory locomotion, but the habits of fossil sloths are considerably more diverse and include locomotory modes such as inferred bipedality, quadrupedality, arboreality or semiarboreality, climbing, and an aquatic or semi-aquatic lifestyle in saltwater. Modern tree sloths are generalist browsers, but fossil sloths had browsing, grazing, or mixed feeding dietary habits. Discovery of two important sloth faunas in Brazil (Jacobina) and southern North America (Daytona Beach and Rancho La Brea) have permitted evaluation of the ontogenetic variation in Eremotherium laurillardi and the existence of possible sexual dimorphism in this sloth and in Paramylodon harlani. A new dental terminology applicable to a majority of clades has been developed, facilitating comparisons among taxa. An analysis wherein functional traits were plotted onto a phylogeny of sloths was used to determine patterns of evolutionary change across the clade. These analyses suggest that megatherioid sloths were primitively semiarboreal or possessed climbing adaptations, a feature retained in some members of the family Megalonychidae. Pedolateral stance in the hindfoot is shown to be convergently acquired in Mylodontidae and Megatheria (Nothrotheriidae + Megatheriidae), this feature serving as a synapomorphy of the latter clade. Digging adaptations can only be securely ascribed to scelidotheriine and mylodontine sloths, and the latter are also the only group of grazing sloths, the remainder being general browsers.",2012,Journal of Mammalian Evolution
Identification of a Nine-Gene Signature and Establishment of a Prognostic Nomogram Predicting Overall Survival of Pancreatic Cancer,"Background: Pancreatic cancer is highly lethal and aggressive with increasing trend of mortality in both genders. An effective prediction model is needed to assess prognosis of patients for optimization of treatment. Materials and Methods: Seven datasets of mRNA expression and clinical data were obtained from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. Level 3 mRNA expression and clinicopathological data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PAAD) dataset. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pancreatic tumor and normal tissue were identified by integrated analysis of multiple GEO datasets. Univariate and Lasso Cox regression analyses were applied to identify overall survival-related DEGs and establish a prognostic gene signature whose performance was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curve, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve. GSE62452 and GSE57495 were used for external validation. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and tumor immunity analysis were applied to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and immune relevance. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify independent prognostic factors in pancreatic cancer. Finally, a prognostic nomogram was established based on the TCGA PAAD dataset. Results: A nine-gene signature comprising MET, KLK10, COL17A1, CEP55, ANKRD22, ITGB6, ARNTL2, MCOLN3, and SLC25A45 was established to predict overall survival of pancreatic cancer. The ROC curve and C-index indicated good performance of the nine-gene signature at predicting overall survival in the TCGA dataset and external validation datasets relative to classic AJCC staging. The nine-gene signature could classify patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct overall survival and differentiate tumor from normal tissue. Univariate Cox regression revealed that the nine-gene signature was an independent prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer. The nomogram incorporating the gene signature and clinical prognostic factors was superior to AJCC staging in predicting overall survival. The high-risk group was enriched with multiple oncological signatures and aggressiveness-related pathways and associated with significantly lower levels of CD4+ T cell infiltration. Conclusion: Our study identified a nine-gene signature and established a prognostic nomogram that reliably predict overall survival in pancreatic cancer. The findings may be beneficial to therapeutic customization and medical decision-making.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
"Diversity and distribution of seagrasses around Inhaca Island, southern Mozambique","Nine seagrass species were identified around Inhaca as well as a more narrow form of Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forsk.) den Hartog occurring in rocky pools at the north east coast. Seagrasses were mapped and grouped in seven distinct community types (in order of areas covered): Thalassia hemprichii/Halodule wrightii, Zostera capensis, Thalassodendron ciliatum/Cymodocea serrulata, Thalassodendron ciliatum/seaweeds, Cymodocea rotundata/Halodule wrightii, Cymodocea serrulata and Halophila ovalis /Halodule wrightii; with the ninth species Syringodium isoetifolium occurring in three of these communities. A dichotomous identification key is presented. Seagrasses covered half of the whole intertidal area around Inhaca Island and diversity was also high at community level. Transects at macro and micro scales showed zonation of species which may be due to tidal gradients or topographic variation. Cluster analysis indicated ecological dissimilarities between co-dominant species. A decline of Zostera capensis has recently been seen outside the local village. Baseline studies like this are important for coastal zone management in developing countries, where large future changes in seagrass cover can be expected.",2002,South African Journal of Botany
"Sensory mapping, development and their applications to feature and attention selection","Rich literature has been generated on computer vision systems. However, an implementable computational model of immediate vision for general and unknown environments is still illusive. Motivated by the autonomous development process of humans, we are interested in building a robot vision system that automatically develops its visual cognitive skills through realtime interactions with the environment. Developmental vision is required by the demands of general-purpose vision systems for complex human environments. 
Based upon the above requirement, in this dissertation we propose a general architecture called Staggered Hierarchical Mapping (SHM) that performs feature derivation for a set of receptive fields and attention selection. The work reported here is motivated by the structure of the early visual pathway. We use several layers of staggered receptive fields to model the needed units of local analysis. From sequentially sensed video frames the proposed algorithm develops a hierarchy of filters, whose outputs are maximally uncorrelated within each layer, and contains an increasing scale of receptive fields that range from low to high layers. We also show how this general architecture can be applied to occluded face recognition, which demonstrates a case of attention selection. Besides this general neural network architecture, we develop several sensory mapping learning rules for deriving feature detectors, including a fast incremental independent component analysis (ICA) method called Lobe Component Analysis (LCA), which derives independent components for many natural cases. A mathematical analysis of the algorithm has been done and which shows the advantages of the LCA method. 
We push the research further by investigating the LCA method in a overcomplete setting, which means the number of basis functions is greater than dimension of the observation. A new incremental method is developed to solve the equivalent regression problem with sparse regulization term, i.e. the LASSO regression. We show that the LCA method is a special case when noise is not present. It makes LCA's principal applicable to a large variety of applications, e.g. classification, regression, and feature selection.",2006,
Pattern recognition of Hodgkin-Huxley equations by auto-regressive Laguerre Volterra network,"A nonparametric, data-driven nonlinear auto-regressive Volterra (NARV) [1] model has been successfully applied for capturing the dynamics in the generation of action potentials, which is classically modeled by Hodgkin-Huxley (H-H) equations. However, the compactness still need to be improved for further interpretations. Therefore, we propose a novel Auto-regressive Sparse Laguerre Volterra Network (ASLVN) model (shown in Figure â€‹Figure1A),1A), which is developed from traditional Laguerre Volterra Network (LVN) and principal dynamic mode (PDM) framework [2].

We adopt stochastic global optimization algorithm Simulated Annealing [3] to train the ASLVN instead of Back-propagation method [2] to avoid local minima and convergence problems.

The prediction results are shown in Fig.1B, it can be seen that the exogenous output z(1) represents the subthreshold dynamics in phase III, and the autoregressive output z(2) dominates in the spike shape in phase I, and the cross term output z(x) helps to maintain the refractory period by cancelling the effect of z(1) in phase II and we also observe that refractory inhibition effect decays after initiation of AP, which explains the absolute refractory period and relative refractory period in physiology.",2015,BMC Neuroscience

False alarms in multi-target radar detection within a sparsity framework,"Existing radar detection schemes are typically studied for single target scenarios and they can be non-optimal when there are multiple targets in the scene.

"Urinary Magnesium and Other Elements in Relation to Mammographic Breast Density, a Measure of Breast Cancer Risk.","PURPOSE
Heavy metals and other elements may act as breast carcinogens due to estrogenic activity. We investigated associations between urine concentrations of a panel of elements and breast density.


METHODS
Mammographic density categories were abstracted from radiology reports of 725 women aged 40-65Â yr in the Avon Army of Women. A panel of 27 elements was quantified in urine using high resolution magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We applied LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) logistic regression to the 27 elements and calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dense vs. nondense breasts, adjusting for potential confounders.


RESULTS
Of the 27 elements, only magnesium (Mg) was selected into the optimal regression model. The odds ratio for dense breasts associated with doubling the Mg concentration was 1.24 (95% CI 1.03-1.49). Doubling the calcium-to-magnesium ratio was inversely associated with dense breasts (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98).


CONCLUSIONS
Our cross-sectional study found that higher levels of urinary magnesium were associated with greater breast density. Prospective studies are needed to confirm whether magnesium as evaluated in urine is prospectively associated with breast density and, more importantly, breast cancer.",2018,Nutrition and cancer

Very Rapid Induction of General Patterns,"Very Rapid Induction of General Patterns Robert F. Hadley School of Computing Science and Cognitive Science Program Simon Fraser University Burnaby, B.C., V5A 1S6 hadley@cs.sfu.ca Abstract Marcus (1998) and Phillips (2000) each have produced examples of human generalizations which, they argue, cannot be matched by the best known connectionist ar- chitectures and training algorithms. However, I argue that humans perform the crucial generalizations without being trained on the exemplars that Marcus and Phillips cite. So, in a sense, the issue whether networks can be trained to perform the crucial generalizations is a red herring. I argue further that humans achieve the dramatic general- izations in question as a side-effect of a variety of pre- existing skills, working in concert. Finally, it is shown that the â€œhard casesâ€ displayed by Marcus and Phillips do in fact provide the basis for a serious challenge to pure (non-modular) connectionist architectures. Introduction In Marcus (1998, in press) and Phillips (2000), intriguing refinements on the (1988) Fodor-Pylyshyn â€œgeneraliza- tion challengeâ€ are presented. Both Marcus and Phillips argue that linguistically competent humans exhibit im- portant forms of generalization that backpropagation- trained networks (both recurrent and feedforward) can- not attain. Though neither author categorically asserts that their negative conclusions apply to every form of connectionist training, both authors argue that commonly recognized varieties of eliminativist architectures (i.e., those eschewing classical representations) are at stake. 1 In this paper, I examine two instances which typ- ify the â€œhardest challengesâ€ produced by these authors. While I agree that they have each exposed some impor- tant training limitations of backpropagation networks, I shall argue that humans perform the crucial generaliza- tions without being trained on the exemplars that Mar- cus and Phillips cite. So, in one sense, the issue whether networks can be trained to perform the crucial general- izations is a red herring. As I argue, humans possess the relevant generalization capacity because they have previ- ously acquired separate skills which, working in concert, allow for nearly instantaneous pattern induction and rea- soning. To be sure, the prior acquisition of these separate 1 Here I am following Fodor and Pylyshynâ€™s (1988) usage, according to which a composite (or complex) representation is classical in structure if one cannot activate (or token) that representation without, at the same time, tokening its syntactic constituents. skills may involve â€œtraining upâ€ various sub-networks in our brains, but this prior training may well not involve the â€œhardâ€ kinds of generalization at issue. Having said that, I would emphasize that my even- tual, general conclusion supports both the positions of Marcus and Phillips. For, in the final section I consider whether connectionist architectures are capable (without implementing classically symbolic methods) of orches- trating the application of our â€œprior skillsâ€ in a fashion that permits very rapid pattern induction and reasoning. My conclusion favors the classicist position on this is- sue. Moreover, I propose a new challenge for eliminative connectionists which, in my view, formulates the deeper difficulty posed by the aforementioned â€œhard casesâ€ of Marcus and Phillips. The Hard Generalization Tasks Generalizing Outside the Training Space Marcus (1998) defines a networkâ€™s training space as the N-dimensional vector space created by the non-zero training values of the N units comprising the networkâ€™s input array. A datum presented during the networkâ€™s (post-training) test phase lies â€œoutside the training spaceâ€ if and only if that datum does not fall within the vector space just mentioned. In effect, this entails that the datum is novel relative to the training corpus. For example, any datum would be novel in the relevant sense if it presented non-zero values to the input array in units that contained only zero values during training. This â€œgeneralization hurdleâ€ differs somewhat from the hierarchy of systematicity given in Hadley (1994a), but it appears equivalent to one of several levels of gener- alization formulated in Niklasson and van Gelder (1994). Interestingly, in the latter paper, the authors claim to sat- isfy this particular generalization challenge. Their claim is questioned in Hadley (1994b) and wholly disputed by Marcus (1998). Moreover, Marcus discusses a number of specific ways in which a network can fail to gener- alize outside its training space, and we now consider a particular â€œhard caseâ€ which Niklasson and van Gelder had not addressed. Suppose a linguistically competent human is presented with the following series: â€œA rose is a roseâ€, â€œA frog is a frogâ€, â€œA pencil is a pencilâ€. Humans will typically have no difficulty inducing the general pattern and complet-",2001,
Robust Granger Analysis in Lp Norm Space for Directed EEG Network Analysis,"Granger analysis (GA) is widely used to construct directed brain networks based on various physiological recordings, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, and electroencephalogram (EEG). However, in real applications, EEGs are inevitably contaminated by unexpected artifacts that may distort the networks because of the L2 norm structure utilized in GAs when estimating directed links. Compared with the L2 norm, the Lp (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${p} \le \mathsf {1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) norm can compress outlier effects. In this paper, an extended GA is constructed by applying the Lp (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${p} \le \mathsf {1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) norm strategy to estimate robust causalities under outlier conditions, and a feasible iteration procedure is utilized to solve the new GA model. A quantitative evaluation using a predefined simulation network demonstrates smaller bias errors and higher linkage consistence for the Lp (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${p} = \mathsf {1.0}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2) -GAs compared with both the Lasso- and L2-GAs under various simulated outlier conditions. Applications in resting-state EEGs that contain ocular artifacts also show that the proposed GA can effectively compress the ocular outlier influence and recover the reliable networks. The proposed Lp-GA may be helpful in capturing the reliable network structure when EEGs are contaminated with artifacts in related studies.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering
Emigration from Nepal: some major issues.,"
 This study examined emigration from Nepal during 1952-91. Data were obtained from census records decennially. Records indicate that the volume of emigration amounted to about 2.39% of total population in 1952-53, and 3.58% in 1991. The level of emigration rose from 198,120 persons to 658,290. Emigrants are persons who were absent from their home for more than 6 months due to tourism, pilgrimage, business trips, studies, employment, or permanent migration. Most emigrants return home after several months or years. A recent survey finds that 14.1% returned after more than 5 years. The Nepal model of migration is different from conventional or Marxist models. For example, landlessness or near landlessness are not the primary reasons for migration. The recent emigration to Arab countries is driven by the desire for better income. Emigrants pay handsomely to go abroad for work (Rs. 85,000). Nepalese emigrate to Australia and the US for a better income and a better life. The proportion of female emigrants was 6.23% of total emigrants to Arab countries, and 16.2% to India. 31% of emigrants were females who emigrated to North America, and 29% emigrated to European countries. Emigrants to Arab countries were likely to return home. Emigrants to North America and Europe were likely to be permanent migrants. The author prefers Mellassoux's (1981) model that says that Nepal is losing manpower during their most productive years. Remittances do not offset the loss. Government costs are incurred for supporting education abroad, benefits in old age and for youth, and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

Crystal structure of the coat protein of the flexible filamentous papaya mosaic virus.,"Papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) is a filamentous plant virus that belongs to the Alphaflexiviridae family. Flexible filamentous viruses have defied more than two decades of effort in fiber diffraction, and no high-resolution structure is available for any member of the Alphaflexiviridae family. Here, we report our structural characterization of PapMV by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy three-dimensional reconstruction. We found that PapMV is 135Ã… in diameter with a helical symmetry of ~10 subunits per turn. Crystal structure of the C-terminal truncated PapMV coat protein (CP) reveals a novel all-helix fold with seven Î±-helices. Thus, the PapMVCP structure is different from the four-helix-bundle fold of tobacco mosaic virus in which helix bundling dominates the subunit interface in tobacco mosaic virus and conveys rigidity to the rod virus. PapMV CP was crystallized as an asymmetrical dimer in which one protein lassoes the other by the N-terminal peptide. Mutation of residues critical to the inter-subunit lasso interaction abolishes CP polymerization. The crystal structure suggests that PapMV may polymerize via the consecutive N-terminal loop lassoing mechanism. The structure of PapMV will be useful for rational design and engineering of the PapMV nanoparticles into innovative vaccines.",2012,Journal of molecular biology
Accurate ensemble pruning with PL-bagging,"Ensemble pruning deals with the selection of base learners prior to combination in order to improve prediction accuracy and efficiency. In the ensemble literature, it has been pointed out that in order for an ensemble classifier to achieve higher prediction accuracy, it is critical for the ensemble classifier to consist of accurate classifiers which at the same time diverse as much as possible. In this paper, a novel ensemble pruning method, called PL-bagging, is proposed. In order to attain the balance between diversity and accuracy of base learners, PL-bagging employs positive Lasso to assign weights to base learners in the combination step. Simulation studies and theoretical investigation showed that PL-bagging filters out redundant base learners while it assigns higher weights to more accurate base learners. Such improved weighting scheme of PL-bagging further results in higher classification accuracy and the improvement becomes even more significant as the ensemble size increases. The performance of PL-bagging was compared with state-of-the-art ensemble pruning methods for aggregation of bootstrapped base learners using 22 real and 4 synthetic datasets. The results indicate that PL-bagging significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble pruning methods such as Boosting-based pruning and Trimmed bagging.",2015,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Running Head : Cryptic density dependence CRYPTIC DENSITY DEPENDENCE : EFFECTS OF SPATIO-TEMPORAL COVARIATION BETWEEN DENSITY AND SITE QUALITY IN REEF FISH,"The importance and strength of density dependence continues to engender debate because of its central importance to population dynamics and regulation. Here, we show how confounding effects of site quality can mask strong effects of density dependence. In particular, we explore spatio-temporal variation and covariation among (1) densities of newly settled coral reef fish (Thalassoma hardwicke), (2) environmental characteristics, and (3) the strength of density-dependent mortality. Environmental features of patch reefs were spatially and temporally variable and influenced density-dependent survival. Higher quality sites (i.e., reefs possessing features yielding greater numbers of recruits at any given settlement level) received greater settlement, and this relationship masked the operation of density dependence when variation in quality among sites (or times) was not distinguished (a common approach in many observational studies of density dependence). Our work illustrates how spatio-temporal covariation in settlement density and site quality can obscure patterns of density dependence at larger scales, contributing to a phenomenon we call cryptic density dependence. Acknowledging patterns and consequences of covariance may alter the way we study population dynamics, especially of marine organisms where the link between processes that affect settlement and post-settlement survival remains relatively poorly understood.",2002,
"Underwater visual census of fishes in the St Lucia marine reserve, South Africa","The first quantitative estimates of fish abundance on the high latitude (27 degree S) coral reefs in the St Lucia Marine Reserve on the South African coast are presented. Selected species were monitored annually by underwater visual census at fixed transect sites at Two Mile Reef and Leadsman Shoal during the period 1987-1992. The wrasse Thalassoma hebraicum was the only monitored species to be recorded on all 22 transects and had a mean abundance of 24,2 per 1000 m super(2) at Two Mile Reef and 40,1 per 1000 m super(2) at Leadsman Shoal. Other species which had high frequencies of occurrence were Acanthurus leucosternon, Chaetodon madagaskariensis, C. unimaculatus, Forcipiger flavissimus, Lutjanus kasmira, L. russelli, L. bohar, Bodianus diana, B. bilunulatus and Amphiprion allardi",1995,
When the refugee status becomes an economic asset: how Malians in a BurkinabÃ© City negotiate the â€œrefugeeâ€ category,"ABSTRACT Since early 2016, part of the Malian urban refugees living in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, have to â€œcapitalizeâ€ on their refugee status to make ends meet. By examining when, why, and how the refugee status transmutes into an economic asset, this article shows how the possibilities to negotiate with the refugee category vary significantly within this group of forced migrants. Indeed, categories are not only imposed on people, but are negotiated by the actors themselves in their interactions and within their social and political economies. My article shows how the refugeesâ€™ ability or possibility to participate in the co-construction of their category is shaped by both the social and political context in which they are, as well as by wider intersectional and structural dynamics in which their lives are situated, such as socio-economic class, gender and race.",2020,Ethnic and Racial Studies
