Medicine Discrimination of NIRS Based on Regularized Collaborative Representation Classification with Gabor Optimizer,"Counterfeit medicine still exists widely, which have affected our health and life. So the discrimination (classification) of medicine is becoming more and more important. Then near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a popular and effective technique used on the medicine classification with nondestructive characteristics. To solve the discrimination of medicines, the sparse signal representation model is established in the presence of spectrum crossover and overlapping. However, the sparsity of nonzero representation coefficients is low during solving the \( L_{ 2} \)-norm on representation model. To overcome this problem, in this paper a novel classification modelâ€”regularized collaborative representation classification with Gabor optimizer (RCRCG) is proposed. Gabor filter is adopted to control the \( L_{2} \)-norm for the more relevant factor vectors. Then Lasso regulation on local classification is proved to improve the accuracy on the medicine discrimination. The experiments using NIRS samples from the three datasets (active substance, Erythromycin Ethylsuccinate and Domperidone) show that the proposed method is more effective and robust than the existing ones, and it has speed-up about 1 times compared with the Sparse Representation based Classification (SRC) and Class \( L_{1} \)-optimizer classifier with the closeness rule (C_CL1C).",2019,
"Environmental and correlative significance of a non-marine algal limestone (Westphalian D), Sydney Coalfield, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia","The occurrence of an algal limestone containing stromatolites within the Morien Group (Sydney Coalfield) is reported for the first time. Three distinct morphologic forms of stromatolite (pinnacle, mat and detached) and their stratigraphic variation are described. Variation in clast type and size, biota and elements within the algal limestone is interpreted as evidence for the growth of stromatolites on the shore of an ephemeral, fresh to brackish lake, subject to fluctuating water levels. Pinnacle and mat forms developed on substrate irregularities. A bivalve and ostracode fauna in mudatones and siltstones above and below the algal limestone indicates a correlation with the Anthraconauta tenuis chronozone of Britain (Westphalian D) and corroborates on age derived from associated macro- and microflora.

Model-assisted calibration of non-probability sample survey data using adaptive LASSO,"The probability-sampling-based framework has dominated survey research because it provides precise mathematical tools to assess sampling variability. However increasing costs and declining response rates are expanding the use of non-probability samples, particularly in general population settings, where samples of individuals pulled from web surveys are becoming increasingly cheap and easy to access. But non-probability samples are at risk for selection bias due to differential access, degrees of interest, and other factors. Calibration to known statistical totals in the population provide a means of potentially diminishing the effect of selection bias in non-probability samples. Here we show that model calibration using adaptive LASSO can yield a consistent estimator of a population total as long as a subset of the true predictors is included in the prediction model, thus allowing large numbers of possible covariates to be included without risk of overfitting. We show that the model calibration using adaptive LASSO provides improved estimation with respect to mean square error relative to standard competitors such as generalized regression (GREG) estimators when a large number of covariates are required to determine the true model, with effectively no loss in efficiency over GREG when smaller models will suffice. We also derive closed form variance estimators of population totals, and compare their behavior with bootstrap estimators. We conclude with a real world example using data from the National Health Interview Survey.",2018,
Microbial community profiles grown on 1020 carbon steel surfaces in seawater-isolated microcosm,"Corrosion of metallic alloys is a concern worldwide, with impacts affecting different production sectors and consequent economic losses in the order of billions of dollars annually. Biocorrosion is a form of corrosion where the participation of microorganisms can induce, accelerate, or inhibit corrosive processes. In this study, it was evaluated that the changes in profile communities, by the sequencing of the 16S ribosomal gene, grown over steel coupons in a microcosm with no additional oxygen supplementation for 120 days. Analysis of abundance and diversity indices indicates marked changes in microbial structures throughout the 120-day period. Homology results of OTUs generated by Illumina sequencing indicated Proteobacteria phylum as the dominant group, comprising about 85.3% of the total OTUs, followed by Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes, both with 7.35%. Analyses at lower taxonomic levels suggested the presence of representatives described as corroders, such as Citreicella thiooxidans, Thalassospira sp., and Limnobacter thiooxidans. In conclusion, the results suggest that no additional oxygen supplementation profoundly altered the core of microbial communities, with a predominance of facultative anaerobic species.",2020,Annals of Microbiology
Traditionality of mating-site preferences in a coral reef fish,"Mating systems are often viewed as a result of females choosing where, when and with whom to mate1,2, and of male responses to female behaviour3,4. If the distribution of females reflects their response to vital resources for survival and reproduction, then a careful study of these resources should yield predictions about the emergent mating system. Males and females could, however, simply gather at traditional sites to mate5. If so, analysis of the current state of the environment may yield incorrect predictions about mating sites5â€“9. Mating sites of the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum have remained in daily use over 12 years (four generations) without changing locations. Here, I show that experimental replacement of entire local populations led to the use of new sites, which continued to be used after the manipulations. Thus mating site locations may not be the result of individual assessment of current resource quality, but instead represent culturally transmitted traditions. Attempts to explain mating patterns based on the distribution of resources should therefore be approached with caution.",1988,Nature
A New Frog of the Genus Eleutherodactylus from Western Panama,"Eleutherodactylus jota sp. nov. is named from Bocas del Toro province in western Panama. It is closely allied to E. bransfordii (with which it is sympatric) and E. podiciferus (found at higher altitudes) but readily differs from each in having folds along the forearm and tarsus, a calcar, and a short first toe, as well as in snout shape. In the course of searching for a Middle American representative of the discoidalis Group of Eleutherodactylus, I found a small sample of a distinctive Eleutherodactylus species from western Panama. Although superficially resembling E. dolops Lynch & Duellman, E. elassodiscus Lynch, E. mantipus (Boulenger), and E. nigrovittatus Anderson (the discoidalis Group representatives of northwestern South America), the Panamanian frogs have feebly areolate skin of the venter and a short first finger as do E. bransfordii (Cope) and E. podiciferus (Cope). All of these frogs have broad vomerine odontophores (Fig. 1C). In the account below, the following abbreviations are employed: SVLsnout-vent length; HW--head width; IOD--interorbital distance; E-Neye to nostril distance. Eleutherodactylus jota sp. nov. Holotype.

Clinical Pharmacogenetic Models of Treatment Response to Methotrexate Monotherapy in Slovenian and Serbian Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: Differences in Patient's Management May Preclude Generalization of the Models,"Objectives: Methotrexate (MTX) is the first line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but nevertheless 30% of patients experience MTX inefficacy. Our aim was to develop a clinical pharmacogenetic model to predict which RA patients will not respond to MTX monotherapy. We also assessed whether this model can be generalized to other populations by validating it on a group of Serbian RA patients. Methods: In 110 RA Slovenian patients, data on clinical factors and 34 polymorphisms in MTX pathway were analyzed by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized regression to select variables associated with the disease activity as measured by Disease Activity Score (DAS28) score after 6 months of MTX monotherapy. A clinical pharmacogenetic index was constructed from penalized regression coefficients with absolute value above 0.05. This index was cross-validated and also independently validated on 133 Serbian RA patients. Results: A clinical pharmacogenetic index for prediction of DAS28 after 6 months of MTX monotherapy in Slovenian RA patients consisted of DAS28 score at diagnosis, presence of erosions, MTX dose, Solute Carrier Family 19 Member 1 (SLC19A1) rs1051266, Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) rs2306283, Thymidylate Synthase (TYMS), and Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase 1 (AMPD1) rs17602729. It correctly classified 69% of Slovenian patients as responders or nonresponders and explained 30% of variability in DAS28 after 6 months of MTX monotherapy. Testing for validity in another population showed that it classified correctly only 22.5% of Serbian RA patients. Conclusions: We developed a clinical pharmacogenetic model for DAS28 after 6 months of MTX monotherapy in Slovenian RA patients by combining clinical and genetic variables. The clinical pharmacogenetic index developed for Slovenian patients did not perform well on Serbian patients, presumably due to the differences in patients' characteristics and clinical management between the two groups.",2018,Frontiers in Pharmacology
Genotype-immunophenotype analysis reveals the immunogenomic subtype and prognosis of multiple myeloma.,"Immune dysfunction plays an important role in tumour development, recurrence, therapeutic responses and overall survival. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal B-cell malignancy which characterized by antitumoural immune dysfunction. In this study, we analyzed 28 tumour-immune-related pathways and calculated the immune pathway score through published microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data portal. A training set of 345 patients and a validation set of 214 patients with primary MM were chosen. We performed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis to identify prognostic factors. Then we used cluster analysis to divide patients into three immunogenomic subtypes, which named abnormal immune activated type, common type and anti-myeloma immune activated type. Logâ€‘rank tests showed that anti-myeloma immune activated type had the best prognosis and abnormal immune activated type had the shortest overall survival (OS) (P=0.000) and event-free survival (EFS) (P=0.000). Multivariate Cox also indicated that the immunogenomic subtype was an independent predictor of OS (P=0.001) and EFS (P=0.000). We also analyzed the characteristics and the immune-response patterns of different subtypes. Then, we established a mathematical model to classify patients in the validation set. In the validation set, patients with different immunogenomic subtypes also had a significantly different OS (P=0.001) and EFS (P=0.005). Our study explored tumour-immune-related pathways at a multi-dimensional level and found the immunogenomic subtype of MM. Potential mechanisms on the genetic level of how tumour-immunity influences the prognosis and therapeutic responses are provided. The immunogenomic subtype may be feasible for deciding clinical treatment in the future.",2020,Carcinogenesis
Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent.,"We develop fast algorithms for estimation of generalized linear models with convex penalties. The models include linear regression, two-class logistic regression, and multinomial regression problems while the penalties include â„“(1) (the lasso), â„“(2) (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.",2010,Journal of statistical software
Chemical Modification of Microcin J25 Reveals New Insights on the Stereospecific Requirements for Antimicrobial Activity,"In this study, microcin J25, a potent antimicrobial lasso peptide that acts on Gram-negative bacteria, was subjected to a harsh treatment with a base in order to interrogate its stability and mechanism of action and explore its structure-activity relationship. Despite the high stability reported for this lasso peptide, the chemical treatment led to the detection of a new product. Structural studies revealed that this product retained the lasso topology, but showed no antimicrobial activity due to the epimerization of a key residue for the activity. Further microbiological assays also demonstrated that it showed a high synergistic effect with colistin.",2019,International Journal of Molecular Sciences

Multiplex screening of 275 plasma protein biomarkers to identify a signature for early detection of colorectal cancer,"Blood-based protein biomarkers may be an attractive option for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we used a two-stage design to measure 275 protein markers by proximity extension assay (PEA), first in plasma samples of a discovery set consisting of 98 newly diagnosed CRC cases and 100 age and gender matched controls free of neoplasm at screening colonoscopy. An algorithm predicting the presence of early or late stage CRC was derived by Lasso regression with .632+ bootstrap method and the algorithms were then validated using PEA again in an independent validation set consisting of participants of screening colonoscopy with and without CRC (n= 56 and 102, respectively). Three different signatures for all, early, and late stages CRC consisting of 9, 12, and 11 protein markers were obtained in the discovery set with areas under the curves (AUCs) after .632+ bootstrap adjustment of 0.92, 0.91 and 0.96, respectively. External validation among participants of screening colonoscopy yielded AUCs of 0.76 (95%CI, 0.67-0.84), 0.75 (95%CI, 0.62-0.87) and 0.80 (95%CI, 0.68-0.89) for all, early, and late stage CRC, respectively. Although the identified protein markers are not competitive with the best available stool tests, these proteins may contribute to the development of powerful blood-based tests for CRC early detection in the future.",2019,Molecular Oncology
Using differential nonlinear gene co-expression network analysis for identification gastric cancer related genes,"Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies and ranks the second highest mortality in the world today. With this great progress, understanding of tumors is still a wide area to study. We utilized the distance correlation as the measurement of the relevance to construct the gene co-expression networks in both gastric cancer and normal tissue datasets respectively, also to define the complex interactions among genes with nonlinear property preserved and examine from the genes that have important roles in the gastric cancer formation. The genes which are extant in the module of normalassociated network but missing in the module of cancer-associated network are selected for further study and we call these genes stray genes. The results show the stray genes are enriched in up-regulation and the connectivity of all the genes appear the circumstance of loss in the gastric cancer network, especially to the stray genes. These results indicate that the activation of these stray genes may play important roles in the gastric cancer. We use PANTHER for Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and the results show that these stray genes are enriched in some biological processes, including cell cycle, chromosome segregation, DNA replication and p53 pathway and others. These results prove the effectiveness of our method for cancer-related genes identification and these cancer-related genes can be selected for further analysis.",2017,Biomedical Research-tokyo
Effects of temperature and biostimulation on oil-degrading microbial communities in temperate estuarine waters.,"Improved strategies for oil-spill remediation will follow a better understanding of the nature, activities and regulating parameters of petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading microbial communities in temperate marine environments. The addition of crude oil to estuarine water resulted in an immediate change in bacterial community structure, increased abundance of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms and a rapid rate of oil degradation, suggesting the presence of a pre-adapted oil-degrading microbial community and sufficient supply of nutrients. Relatively rapid degradation was found at 4 degrees C, the lowest temperature tested; and it was temperature rather than nutrient addition that most influenced the community structure. A detailed phylogenetic analysis of oil-degrading microcosms showed that known hydrocarbonoclastic organisms like Thalassolituus and Cycloclasticus, as well as proposed oil degraders like Roseobacter, were present at both 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C, demonstrating the thermo-versatility of such organisms. Clones related to Oleispira antarctica (98% 16S rRNA similarity), a psychrophilic alkane degrader, were dominant in the 4 degrees C oil-degrading community, whereas other clones constituting a different clade and showing 94% similarity 16S rRNA with O. antarctica were found in situ. These findings demonstrate the potential for intrinsic bioremediation throughout the course of the year in temperate estuarine waters, and highlight the importance of both versatile psychrotolerant and specialized psychrophilic hydrocarbon-degrading microbes in effecting this process at low temperatures.",2007,Environmental microbiology
"Free and Particle-associated Extracellular Enzyme Activity and Bacterial Production in the Lower Elbe Estuary, Germany","A high abundance of particles and aggregates is a characteristic of estuaries and may represent important loci of increased bioproductivity and microbial activity. From a survey performed in the Elbe estuary, particle concentration (using a particle counter), bacterial biomass and abundance (AODC method), bacterial production rates ([3H] thymidine method) and the microbial extracellular enzyme activity of 11 enzymes (MUF and MCA method) were determined with particular respect to their relationship to particles and aggregates (sizefractionated). Although higher particle abundance was found compared to other sections of the river Elbe, neither relative nor absolute bacterial activity associated with particles and aggregates was enhanced. The activity of free dissolved microbial enzymes was found to dominate the breakdown of organic material. The productivity of free dispersed bacteria â‰¥0.2â€¦ 10 Î¼m (0â€¦40%). This indicates that the larger particles and aggregates do not always contribute substantially to the overall microbial activity in rivers and estuaries. 
 
 
 
Freie und partikelassoziierte extrazellulare Enzymaktivitat und bakterielle Produktion im unteren Elbeastuar, Deutschland 
 
 
 
Hohe Abundanzen von Partikeln und Aggregaten sind fur Astuare charakteristisch, und ihre Textur und Oberflachen konnen wichtige Orte fur eine gesteigerte Bioproduktivitat und mikrobielle Aktivitat reprasentieren. Von einer im Elbeastuar durchgefuhrten Studie wurden Partikelanzahl und -grosenverteilung (Partikelzahler), Abundanz und Biomasse von Bakterien (AODC-Methode), bakterielle Produktionsraten ([3H] Thymidin-Methode) und mikrobielle extrazellulare Enzymaktivitaten (MUF- und MCA-Methode) mit spezieller Hinsicht auf ihre Beziehung zu Partikeln und Aggregaten (Grosenfraktionierung) untersucht. Obwohl im Vergleich zu anderen Flussabschnitten der Elbe eine hohere Partikelabundanz vorgefunden wurde, konnte keine relativ oder â€” mit Ausnahme der meisten Peptidasen, Galactosidasen und der Phosphatase â€” absolut erhohte bakterielle Aktivitat, assoziiert mit Partikeln und Aggregaten, bestimmt werden. Fur den Abbau des organischen Materials war hauptsachlich die Aktivitat der freien gelosten mikrobiellen Enzyme verantwortlich. Die Produktivitat der freien Bakterien (â‰¥0.2â€¦ 10 Î¼m (0â€¦40%). Damit konnte gezeigt werden, dass Partikel und Aggregate nicht zu allen Zeiten in Fliesgewassern und Astuaren substantiell zur mikrobiellen Gesamtaktivitat beitragen.",2003,Acta Hydrochimica Et Hydrobiologica
Regression Networks for Robust Win-Rates Predictions of AI Gaming Bots,"Designing a robust and adaptable Artificial Intelligence (AI) opponent in a computer game would ensure the game continues to challenge, immerse and excite the players at any stage. The outcomes of card based games such as â€œHeartstone: Heroes of Warcraftâ€, aside the player skills, heavily depend on the initial composition of player card decks. To evaluate this impact we have developed a new robust regression network in a context of the AAIA Data Mining Competition 2018, which tries to predict the average win-rates of the specific combinations of bot-player and card decks. Our network is composed of 2 levels: the entry level with an array of finely optimized state of the art regression models including Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), Extreme Gradient Boosted decision tree (XGBOOST), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression trained via supervised learning on the labeled training dataset; and just a single ELM at the 2nd level installed to learn to correct the predictions from the 1st level. The final solution received the root of the mean squared error (RMSE) of just 5.65% and scored the 2nd place in AAIA'2018 competition. This paper also presents two other runner-up models receiving RMSE of 5.7% and 5.86%, scoring the 4th and the 6th place respectively.",2018,2018 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)
Information diffusion network inferring and pathway tracking,"AbstractNetwork diffusion, such as spread of ideas, rumors, contagious disease, or a new type of behaviors, is one of the fundamental processes within networks. Designing effective strategies for influence spread maximization, rumor spread minimization, or epidemic immunization has attracted considerable research attention. However, a key challenge is that many times we can only observe the trace of contagion spreading across network, but the underlying network structure is unknown and the transmission rates between node pairs are unclear to us. In this paper, given the observed information cascades, we aim to address two problems: diffusion network structure inferring and information diffusion pathways tracking. We propose a novel probabilistic model called Network Inferring from Multidimensional Features of Cascades (NIMFC) which takes into account heterogeneous features, including temporal and topological features of cascades, node attributes, and information content, to infer the latent network structure and transmission rates of edges. Also, based on the inferred network structure, we may track diffusion pathways of a cascade in social networks. We use blocked coordinate descent method to learn a sparse estimation of the latent network. Our proposed model NIMFC is evaluated both on large synthetic and real-world data sets, and experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models both in terms of recovering the latent network structure and information pathway tracking.æŠ½è±¡åˆ›æ–°ç‚¹è¿‘å‡ å¹´æ¥, éšç€äº’è”ç½‘çš„å¿«é€Ÿå‘å±•, åœ¨çº¿ç¤¾äº¤ç½‘ç»œä¸­çš„ä¿¡æ¯ä¼ æ’­è¶Šæ¥è¶Šæ™®é, åŒ…æ‹¬çƒ­ç‚¹è¯é¢˜ä¼ æ’­, è§‚ç‚¹ä¼ æ’­, è°£è¨€ä¼ æ’­, è´­ä¹°è¡Œä¸ºæˆ–æµè¡Œæ—¶å°šçš„ä¼ æ’­ç­‰ç­‰. ä¸Žç½‘ç»œä¼ æ’­è¡Œä¸ºç›¸å…³çš„ç ”ç©¶è¯é¢˜, åŒ…æ‹¬å½±å“åŠ›ä¼ æ’­æœ€å¤§åŒ–, æ„è§é¢†è¢–æŒ–æŽ˜, è¯é¢˜å‘çŽ°å’Œè·Ÿè¸ª, äº‹ä»¶çˆ†å‘æ£€æµ‹ç­‰, æ­£å¸å¼•ç€è¶Šæ¥è¶Šå¤šçš„ç ”ç©¶å…´è¶£.è¿™äº›ç ”ç©¶æ‰€é¢ä¸´çš„ä¸€ä¸ªå…±åŒæŒ‘æˆ˜æ˜¯, å¾ˆå¤šæ—¶å€™æˆ‘ä»¬åªèƒ½è§‚å¯Ÿåˆ°ç½‘ç»œä¸­çš„ä¼ æ’­çŽ°è±¡, ä¹Ÿå³ä¸åŒèŠ‚ç‚¹åœ¨ä¸åŒæ—¶é—´ â€œæ„ŸæŸ“â€ äº†ç›®æ ‡ â€œä¼ æŸ“æºâ€, å´ä¸çŸ¥é“æ½œåœ¨çš„ç½‘ç»œç»“æž„, ä»¥åŠç½‘ç»œä¸­ç»“ç‚¹ä¹‹é—´çš„ä¼ æ’­é€ŸçŽ‡.æˆ‘ä»¬å°†ä¿¡æ¯åœ¨ç½‘ç»œä¸­ä¼ æ’­æ—¶æ‰€ç•™ä¸‹çš„æ—¶ç©ºè½¨è¿¹ç§°ä¸ºä¼ æ’­çº§è”. æœ¬æ–‡åŸºäºŽä¿¡æ¯ä¼ æ’­çº§è”æ•°æ®ä¸»è¦ç ”ç©¶ä¸¤æ–¹é¢çš„é—®é¢˜, åˆ†åˆ«æ˜¯ä¼ æ’­ç½‘ç»œç»“æž„æŽ¨æ–­å’Œä¿¡æ¯ä¼ æ’­è·¯å¾„è·Ÿè¸ª.æœ¬æ–‡æå‡ºäº†ä¸€ä¸ªåŸºäºŽä¿¡æ¯çº§è”å¤šç»´ç‰¹å¾èžåˆçš„ç½‘ç»œæŽ¨æ–­ç®—æ³• (NIMFC), è¯¥ç®—æ³•èžåˆäº†å¤šç»´å¼‚æž„ç‰¹å¾, åŒ…æ‹¬ä¿¡æ¯çº§è”çš„æ—¶åºå’Œæ‹“æ‰‘ç‰¹å¾, èŠ‚ç‚¹å±žæ€§, ä¿¡æ¯å†…å®¹, æ¥æŽ¨æ–­æ½œåœ¨ç½‘ç»œç»“æž„, ä»¥åŠèŠ‚ç‚¹ä¹‹é—´çš„ä¼ æ’­é€ŸçŽ‡. å¦å¤–, è¯¥ç®—æ³•è¿˜å¯ä»¥åŸºäºŽå·²æŽ¨æ–­çš„ç½‘ç»œç»“æž„, è¿›ä¸€æ­¥æŽ¨æ–­ä¿¡æ¯åœ¨è¿‡åŽ»æ—¶é—´é‡Œçš„ä¼ æ’­è·¯å¾„.æœ€åŽ, ä¸ºäº†éªŒè¯ç®—æ³•çš„æ•ˆæžœå’Œæ€§èƒ½, æˆ‘ä»¬åœ¨äººå·¥åˆæˆæ•°æ®é›†å’Œæ–°æµªå¾®åšçœŸå®žæ•°æ®é›†ä¸Šè¿›è¡Œäº†å®žéªŒ, ç»“æžœè¡¨æ˜Žåœ¨ç½‘ç»œç»“æž„æŽ¨æ–­å’Œä¿¡æ¯ä¼ æ’­è·¯å¾„è·Ÿè¸ªå‡†ç¡®çŽ‡ä¸¤ä¸ªæ–¹é¢, NIMFC ç®—æ³•å‡ä¼˜äºŽåŒç±»ç®—æ³•.

SOR-Half threshold algorithms based on the sparse index tracking model,"In a recent study of the sparse model,the nonconvex regularization method especially Half threshold algorithm based on L_(1/2)regularization is proved to an effective algorithm,because it can not only obtain the good sparsity,but also fast converges to some a feasible solution of L_(1/2)regularization.In this article,the Half threshold algorithm is improved to propose the successive over relaxation Half(SOR-Half)threshold algorithm and symmetric successive over relaxation Half(SSOR-Half)threshold algorithm.At the same time,the two algorithms are used to solve sparse index tracking problem under the condition of the budget and short limitation.Numerical experiments show that these two kinds of algorithm in solving sparse index tracking problem are more efficient than Half threshold algorithm and LASSO algorithm.",2015,Basic Sciences Journal of Textile Universities
Asymmetric volatility spillovers between UK regional worker flows and vacancies,"This paper investigates volatility spillovers between UK regional job finding, job separation and vacancy rates. Employing a logistic smooth transition vector autoregression (VAR) to model the large nonlinear dynamic system, we use the methods of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) to decompose the forecast error variances. Our approach is Bayesian. More specifically, we extend doubly adaptive elastic-net Lasso (DAELasso) methods for VAR parameter shrinkage into a nonlinear framework to allow for the possible regime changes. We find that for each variable, both the volatility spillovers to and from other variables are high, providing clear evidence for the close interdependence between UK regional labour markets. The pivotal role of London in generating and spreading changes in volatility is highlighted. Analysis of net spillovers shows that, in general, shocks to job separation rates tend to spread into job finding and vacancy rates. By contrast, vacancy rates are usually at the receiving ends of shocks transmitted from the job separation and finding rates. We further examine the shock propagation mechanism in more detail, such as the differences in spillovers between regions within the same regime, and that of the same region but in different regimes. Finally, we draw inferences that are of economic and policy importance.",2017,Applied Economics
Genomics and Prognosis Analysis of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Glioma,"Background: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is regulated by induction factors, transcription factor families and an array of signaling pathways genes, and has been implicated in the invasion and progression of gliomas. Methods: We obtained the Clinicopathological data sets from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). The â€œlimmaâ€ package was used to analyze the expression of EMT-related genes in gliomas with different pathological characteristics. We used the â€œConsensusClusterPlusâ€ package to divide gliomas into two groups to study their correlation with glioma malignancy. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was applied to select seven prognosis-associated genes to build the risk signature, and the coefficients obtained from the LASSO algorithm were used to calculate the risk score which we applied to determine the prognostic value of the risk signature. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine whether the risk signature is an independent prognostic indicator. Results: We analyzed the differentially expressed 22 common epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated genes in 508 gliomas graded by different clinicopathological features. Two glioma subgroups (EM1/2) were identified by consistent clustering of the proteins, of which the EM1 subgroup had a better prognosis than the EM2 subgroup, and the EM2 group was associated with cancer migration and proliferation. Significant enrichment analysis revealed that EMT-related transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways genes were highly related to glioma malignancies. Seven EMT-related genes were used to derive risk scores, which served as independent prognostic markers and prediction factors for the clinicopathological features of glioma. And we found the overall survival (OS) was significantly different between the low- and high-risk groups, the ROC curve indicated that the risk score can predict survival rates for glioma patients. Conclusion: EMT-related induction factors, transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways genes are important players in the malignant progression of glioma and may help in decision making regarding the choice of prognosis assessment and provide us clues to understand EMT epigenetic modification in glioma.",2020,Frontiers in Oncology
Tradition and Change in Language and Discourse: Three Case Studies,"Abstract. The linguistic gumbo presented in this work is three separate sociolinguistic situations--Francoproven[??]al in Europe, Patron Saints' festivals in Central Mexico, and Kuna in Panama. Although each is distinct, all share certain sociolinguistic and discourse changes which raise interesting questions for the communities themselves, as well as for scholars such as ourselves. Introduction. It is an honor and a pleasure to have been invited to make this presentation at LASSO, and thus to be among friends and colleagues, present and former students. I remember with pleasure the various LASSO meetings I have attended. One way back involved a panel on the Mayan Kekchi language that was organized by Sandra Pinkerton and emerged from a field-methods class at UT Austin. I was a plenary speaker in El Paso where I talked about paying serious attention to documentation of language use, which means recording, transcribing, translating, and most recently electronic and web based archiving. Then I helped organize our annual meeting in Austin. In Puebla, Mexico, at that wonderful meeting, I had opportunity to present some of my work leading to my current activities. Today I have chosen to talk about three sociolinguistic situations which I have been researching lately--Francoproven[??]al in the Alpine regions of France, Italy, and Switzerland; Patron saint fiestas in Central Mexico; and discourse among the Kuna Indians of Panama, the work I am probably best known for. While quite different from one another, they all share certain sociolinguistic and discourse changes which raise interesting questions for the communities themselves, as well as for scholars such as ourselves. I have chosen this topic, with the juxtaposition of places, because of the very appropriate name given to this meeting in New Orleans: linguistic gumbo. The origin of the word GUMBO and its referent, a soup, is African. In the Americas gumbo is found in Creole contexts like New Orleans. Gumbo is a mix of ingredients which do not quite mix completely and thoroughly, and therein lies its pleasure. My linguistic gumbo is a mix of ingredients in several senses. First, each of these places in my work presented here is a sociolinguistic mix of ingredients. Second, my juxtaposing them here is another ingredient in the mix. And third, my own involvement in each place, especially among the Kuna recently, provides still another ingredient to the overall mix. Francoproven[??]al. Francoproven[??]al, an offshoot of the Gallo Romance branch of Romance languages, is a cluster of dialects and maybe languages, spoken in an Alpine region surrounding Mont Blanc in three countries--France, Switzerland, and Italy. It is called by various names including Patois, Savoyard, Dauphinois (in France); Fribourgeois, Valaisan (in Switzerland); and Patou[??], Vald[??]tain (in Italy). It is a minority language in each of the three countries. It is most moribund in France and Switzerland and most robust in Italy, especially in the various mountain valleys of the Val d'Aosta where it is still spoken fluently by people of all ages. Very few Francoproven[??]al speakers, if any, are monolingual. It is one of many European Romance languages, such as Proven[??]al, Catalan, Sicilian, and Neapolitan, that are still spoken in Europe but are not the official languages of the nation states in which they are spoken. Francoproven[??]al is the only Romance language spoken in three different European countries. The sociolinguistic situation of Francoproven[??]al typical of minority and endangered languages in Europe manifests unique features according to the country in which it is spoken. In France, which has been actively trying to eliminate minority languages since before the revolution, the national government has exerted tremendous pressure through compulsory education and the media for a monolingual, French speaking nation. It is remarkable that in spite of this pressure, linguistic diversity still exists. â€¦",2006,Southwest Journal of Linguistics
An adaptive penalty multi-pitch estimator with self-regularization,"This work treats multi-pitch estimation, and in particular the common misclassification issue wherein the pitch at half the true fundamental frequency, the sub-octave, is chosen instead of the true pitch. Extending on current group LASSO-based methods for pitch estimation, this work introduces an adaptive total variation penalty, which enforces both group- and block sparsity, as well as deals with errors due to sub-octaves. Also presented is a scheme for signal adaptive dictionary construction and automatic selection of the regularization parameters. Used together with this scheme, the proposed method is shown to yield accurate pitch estimates when evaluated on synthetic speech data. The method is shown to perform as good as, or better than, current state-of-the-art sparse methods while requiring fewer tuning parameters than these, as well as several conventional pitch estimation methods, even when these are given oracle model orders. When evaluated on a set of ten musical pieces, the method shows promising results for separating multi-pitch signals. HighlightsWe propose a multi-pitch estimator based on a regularized least-squares' problem.The method automatically estimates the number of sources and their model orders.The proposed method incorporates a signal adaptive self-regularization scheme.The proposed method is shown to yield accurate pitch frequency estimates.",2016,Signal Process.
Sparse Nonstationary Gabor Expansions - with Applications to Music Signals,"We present a new method for performing nonlinear approximation with redundant dictionaries. The method constructs an mâˆ’term approximation of the signal by thresholding with respect to a weighted version of its canonical expansion coefficients, thereby accounting for dependency between the coefficients. The main result is an associated strong Jackson embedding, which provides an upper bound on the corresponding reconstruction error. To complement the theoretical results, we compare the proposed method to the pure greedy method and the Windowed-Group Lasso by denoising music signals with elements from a Gabor dictionary.",2018,
Using Modified Clavien-Dindo's Classification System for Reporting Postoperative Complications of Transvesical Prostatectomy at Souro Sanou University Teaching Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina-Faso),Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative complications using a standardized classification; modified Clavienâ€™s classification. Patients and methods: We have included all patients aged at least 50-years-old on the day of surgery between the 1st June 2015 and 31st May 2017 at the urology division of Souro Sanou University Teaching Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso. Complications reports were performed according to the modified Clavien-Dindo system. Results: Hundred patients (100) presenting a complication after BPH surgery were included in this study in a total of 312 open prostatectomies performed. The postoperative complication rate was 32%. Seventy percent of the patients had at least one complication. Grade I and Grade II complications according to the modified Clavienâ€™s classification system were the most represented (87%). Two patients (2) died in the immediate postoperative period (Grade V). The presence of urethral catheter before surgery was identified as a risk factor for complication. A statistically significant difference was found in the group ICC Ëƒ 2 (Charlson Index of Comorbidity) for age parameter in the occurrence of complication. Conclusions: Open prostatectomy is associated with high morbidity in subjects with urinary catheters prior to surgery. Grade I and Grade II according to the modified Clavienâ€™s classification system were the most reported.,2019,

Chick survival in relation to nest site: is the Antarctic petrel hiding from its predator?,"In birds, the characteristics of the nest site may affect reproductive success. We found that shelter is an important characteristic of the Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) nests because shelter prevents chick predation. However, the benefit of shelter was countervailed by melt water which mainly entered well-sheltered nests. Chick survival was monitored until the chick was left unattended for the first time. Late-hatched chicks had a higher survival probability than early-hatched chicks, possibly because late hatchers swamp the predator, the south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki). Poorly sheltered nests tended to be occupied by parents with low body mass and late-hatched eggs. The results suggest that both shelter per se and parental characteristics may explain the relationship between predation risk and shelter. We need experiments to study the influence of nest site on reproductive success, and we need to map the frequency of melt water as a cause of reproductive failure.",2004,Polar Biology
"Benefits of Thalassotherapy with Sleep Management on Mood States and Well-being, and Cognitive and Physical Capacities in Healthy Workers","Objective: Thalassotherapy, which combines seawater hydrotherapy and the marine climate, improves mood, fatigue, general well-being, and physical capacities in the working population, but little is known on the interest to add sleep management to cares. We investigated effects of three days of thalassotherapy cares combined with sleep management on psychological and physical capacities using subjective and objective tests in healthy workers. Methods: Cares were undertaken in the morning after tests (10:15-12:15) and in the afternoon (14:15-16:15). Participants were asked to go to sleep from 22:30 to 07:00. Tests were performed at 09:00 before arriving to the resort (T0), the day after arrival (T1), the days following cares (T2, T3, T4), the day after week-end at home (T5) and after three days working (T6). Results: Polysomnographic sleep analysis showed that Total Sleep Time was significantly higher (+6%) the second night compared to the first, indicating an immediate positive effect of hydrotherapy cares. Self-reported mood states and health outcomes scores were improved at T2 in comparison with T1 (-67% for total mood disturbances, -17% for anxiety, -71% for fatigue, +23% for general well-being), as was daytime sleepiness (-26%). The number of lapses in the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (as objective marker of sustained attention) was significantly lower (-59%) at T2 compared to T1, whereas a delayed increase of lower limb flexibility was observed at T4 compared to T1 (+38%). Conclusion: Three days of thalassotherapy combined to sleep management have immediate beneficial effects on self-reported mood states, anxiety, fatigue, well-being and daytime sleepiness, as well as on the objective evaluation of sustained attention, in healthy workers. Beneficial effects on lower limb flexibility are observed after 3 days of cares. Positive effects were still observed after the weekend back home and after 3 days of return to work.",2018,Journal of sleep disorders and therapy
Futurism and Ultraism: Identity and Hybridity in the Spanish Avant-garde,"Abstract This essay argues for an interpretation of Ultraism as a case of hybridity that incorporated disparate avant-garde tendencies - Cubism, Futurism, Dadaism and Expressionism - in order to overcome the preceding modernista tradition. Although this vanguard movement never acquired a privileged position within European experimentalism, it possessed a thriving history in Latin America, where it took roots in the main capitals - Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Caracas, Santiago - and adopted new forms thanks to the efforts of Jorge Luis Borges and Guillermo de Torre. Particularly influenced by Futurist typography, the ultraÃ­stas utilized the potentialities of manifestos, articles and poems to bring about direct and immediate effects. This essay examines a series of poems by Guillermo de Torre, Xavier Boveda, Rafael Lasso de la Vega, Jorge Luis Borges and Volt in order to reflect on avant-garde cross-fertilizations and the impact of pictorial images on poetic language. Along these lines, the Spanish episode of Jorge Luis Borges and Norah Borges is a model case of artistic cross-disciplinarity. In an ekphrastic gesture, Norah Borges translated her brotherâ€™s prism aesthetics into plastic forms and, reciprocally, Jorge Luis Borges wrote poems based on his sisterâ€™s figurative art. Refusing to be confined to an isolated stance, Ultraism partook of migratory movements and exchanges, furthering extremely fertile alignments that conditioned its hybrid identity.",2013,
Model selection for factorial Gaussian graphical models with an application to dynamic regulatory networks,"Abstract Factorial Gaussian graphical Models (fGGMs) have recently been proposed for inferring dynamic gene regulatory networks from genomic high-throughput data. In the search for true regulatory relationships amongst the vast space of possible networks, these models allow the imposition of certain restrictions on the dynamic nature of these relationships, such as Markov dependencies of low order â€“ some entries of the precision matrix are a priori zeros â€“ or equal dependency strengths across time lags â€“ some entries of the precision matrix are assumed to be equal. The precision matrix is then estimated by l1-penalized maximum likelihood, imposing a further constraint on the absolute value of its entries, which results in sparse networks. Selecting the optimal sparsity level is a major challenge for this type of approaches. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a number of model selection criteria for fGGMs by means of two simulated regulatory networks from realistic biological processes. The analysis reveals a good performance of fGGMs in comparison with other methods for inferring dynamic networks and of the KLCV criterion in particular for model selection. Finally, we present an application on a high-resolution time-course microarray data from the Neisseria meningitidis bacterium, a causative agent of life-threatening infections such as meningitis. The methodology described in this paper is implemented in the R package sglasso, freely available at CRAN, http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sglasso.",2016,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
Classifying HCP task-fMRI networks using heat kernels,"Network theory provides a principled abstraction of the human brain: reducing a complex system into a simpler representation from which to investigate brain organisation. Recent advancement in the neuroimaging field are towards representing brain connectivity as a dynamic process in order to gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between functional modules for efficient information transport. In this work, we employ heat kernels to model the process of energy diffusion in functional networks. We extract node-based, multi-scale features which describe the propagation of heat over 'time' which not only inform the importance of a node in the graph, but also incorporate local and global information of the underlying geometry of the network. As a proof-of-concept, we test the efficacy of two heat kernel features for discriminating between motor and working memory functional networks from the Human Connectome Project. For comparison, we also classified task networks using traditional network metrics which similarly provide rankings of node importance. In addition, a variant of the Smooth Incremental Graphical Lasso Estimation algorithm was used to estimate non-sparse, precision matrices to account for non-stationarity in the time series. We illustrate differences in heat kernel features between tasks, and also between regions of the brain. Using a random forest classifier, we showed heat kernel metrics to capture intrinsic properties of functional networks that serve well as features for task classification.",2016,2016 International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Neuroimaging (PRNI)
Taking Advantage of Sparsity in Multi-Task Learning,"We study the problem of estimating multiple linear regression equations for the purpose of both prediction and variable selection. Following recent work on multi-task learning Argyriou et al. [2008], we assume that the regression vectors share the same sparsity pattern. This means that the set of relevant predictor variables is the same across the different equations. This assumption leads us to consider the Group Lasso as a candidate estimation method. We show that this estimator enjoys nice sparsity oracle inequalities and variable selection properties. The results hold under a certain restricted eigenvalue condition and a coherence condition on the design matrix, which naturally extend recent work in Bickel et al. [2007], Lounici [2008]. In particular, in the multi-task learning scenario, in which the number of tasks can grow, we are able to remove completely the effect of the number of predictor variables in the bounds. Finally, we show how our results can be extended to more general noise distributions, of which we only require the variance to be finite.",2009,arXiv: Machine Learning
Predictive value of single-nucleotide polymorphism signature for recurrence in localised renal cell carcinoma: a retrospective analysis and multicentre validation study.,"BACKGROUND
Identification of high-risk localised renal cell carcinoma is key for the selection of patients for adjuvant treatment who are at truly higher risk of reccurrence. We developed a classifier based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to improve the predictive accuracy for renal cell carcinoma recurrence and investigated whether intratumour heterogeneity affected the precision of the classifier.


METHODS
In this retrospective analysis and multicentre validation study, we used paraffin-embedded specimens from the training set of 227 patients from Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) with localised clear cell renal cell carcinoma to examine 44 potential recurrence-associated SNPs, which were identified by exploratory bioinformatics analyses of a genome-wide association study from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) dataset (n=114, 906â€ˆ600 SNPs). We developed a six-SNP-based classifier by use of LASSO Cox regression, based on the association between SNP status and patients' recurrence-free survival. Intratumour heterogeneity was investigated from two other regions within the same tumours in the training set. The six-SNP-based classifier was validated in the internal testing set (n=226), the independent validation set (Chinese multicentre study; 428 patients treated between Jan 1, 2004 and Dec 31, 2012, at three hospitals in China), and TCGA set (441 retrospectively identified patients who underwent resection between 1998 and 2010 for localised clear cell renal cell carcinoma in the USA). The main outcome was recurrence-free survival; the secondary outcome was overall survival.


FINDINGS
Although intratumour heterogeneity was found in 48 (23%) of 206 cases in the internal testing set with complete SNP information, the predictive accuracy of the six-SNP-based classifier was similar in the three different regions of the training set (areas under the curve [AUC] at 5 years: 0Â·749 [95% CI 0Â·660-0Â·826] in region 1, 0Â·734 [0Â·651-0Â·814] in region 2, and 0Â·736 [0Â·649-0Â·824] in region 3). The six-SNP-based classifier precisely predicted recurrence-free survival of patients in three validation sets (hazard ratio [HR] 5Â·32 [95% CI 2Â·81-10Â·07] in the internal testing set, 5Â·39 [3Â·38-8Â·59] in the independent validation set, and 4Â·62 [2Â·48-8Â·61] in the TCGA set; all p<0Â·0001), independently of patient age or sex and tumour stage, grade, or necrosis. The classifier and the clinicopathological risk factors (tumour stage, grade, and necrosis) were combined to construct a nomogram, which had a predictive accuracy significantly higher than that of each variable alone (AUC at 5 years 0Â·811 [95% CI 0Â·756-0Â·861]).


INTERPRETATION
Our six-SNP-based classifier could be a practical and reliable predictor that can complement the existing staging system for prediction of localised renal cell carcinoma recurrence after surgery, which might enable physicians to make more informed treatment decisions about adjuvant therapy. Intratumour heterogeneity does not seem to hamper the accuracy of the six-SNP-based classifier as a reliable predictor of recurrence. The classifier has the potential to guide treatment decisions for patients at differing risks of recurrence.

Row Method of Sugar Beet (beta Vulgaris L.) Fertilization with Multicomponent Fertilizer Based on Urea-ammonium Nitrate Solution as a Way to Increase Nitrogen Efficiency,"Sugar beet is the main crop commonly cultivated for sugar production in temperate regions of the World. Actual yields in main Central Europe producing countries are much lower, due to many limiting factors. Among them, nutrients supply is of great value, especially referring to efficiency of nitrogen, which is generally low. In the conducted study two methods of nitrogen application were compared (i) broadcast of calcium saltpeter and (ii) row application of the multicomponent fertilizer based on urea-ammonium-nitrate (UAN) solution. The basic amount of the applied N was 75 kg ha-1. The highest yields of both taproots and refined sugar were harvested on the plot receiving 75 kg N-1 as UAN liquid multicomponent fertilizer and 50% of the recommended P and K rates. The positive effects of row application of liquid N fertilizer on taproot and sugar yields were also corroborated by high values of indices of agronomic efficiency for both N as well as P and K. However this method of sugar beets fertilization has some possibilities, as indicated by still high contents of melassogenic substances.",2010,Journal of Central European Agriculture
Bayesian lasso for random intercept factor model,"Structural Equation Models (SEM) are often used in psychological research. In many studies, determining the number of variables is di cult because maximum likelihood estimates are empirically under-identi ed when more factors are estimated in the model than are present in the data. In this study, the Random Intercept factor model is considered as a psychometric measurement model which, although useful in many research contexts, does not assume simple structure. We compare the RIF model to other factor models using Bayesian estimation to determine the dimensionality of the data as well as to investigate other psychometric measurement models for the data. The Bayesian Lasso method is explored as an e cient approach which estimates the parameters of the model and adjudicates model selection simultaneously. In an examination of both simulated and empirical data ML SEM's were empirically underidenti ed for overcomplex measurement models. Both conjugate Bayesian approaches and the Bayesian Lasso (BLasso) were found to yield superior estimates of parameters and consistently agreed upon the same measurement model for the data. Taken together, the results suggest that Bayesian approaches are preferable to ML for selection of an appropriate psychometric measurement model for the data. Of the two Bayesian approaches, the BLasso may be preferred given that it does not require speci cation and model comparison of the several types of measurement models considered.",2013,Submitted by the University of Missouri--Columbia Graduate School
â€˜Our Clownâ€™: European Memory and Sentimental Nationality in Charlie Rivel's Unexpected Itinerary,"AbstractThis article traces the unexpected itinerary of Catalan-born circus artist Charlie Rivel [nee Josep Andreu i Lasarre] (1896â€“1983) in order to address the ways in which his story conjures up the complex set of relationships that inform Catalonia's position vis-a-vis a European culture of memory. Rivel became a star of the variety and circus circuit in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s. Already famous in Germany decades before the outbreak of war, the clown performed in sold-out theatres in Berlin from 1941 to 1944. Conjectures about the dilemmas that Charlie Rivel faced in Nazi-ruled Berlin have become the basis for Gerard Vazquez's play Uuuuh! (2005) and Eduard Cortes' feature film, based on the play, El pallasso i el Fuhrer (2007). My reading of both texts shows that an engagement with the memory of the Holocaust is an important component of the Catalan identification and integration processes within a unified Europe.

"BayesWHAM: A Bayesian approach for free energy estimation, reweighting, and uncertainty quantification in the weighted histogram analysis method","The weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) is a powerful approach to estimate molecular free energy surfaces (FES) from biased simulation data. Bayesian reformulations of WHAM are valuable in proving statistically optimal use of the data and providing a transparent means to incorporate regularizing priors and estimate statistical uncertainties. In this work, we develop a fully Bayesian treatment of WHAM to generate statistically optimal FES estimates in any number of biasing dimensions under arbitrary choices of the Bayes prior. Rigorous uncertainty estimates are generated by Metropolis-Hastings sampling from the Bayes posterior. We also report a means to project the FES and its uncertainties into arbitrary auxiliary order parameters beyond those in which biased sampling was conducted. We demonstrate the approaches in applications of alanine dipeptide and the unthreading of a synthetic mimic of the astexin-3 lasso peptide.

Reverse Engineering Galactose Regulation in Yeast through Model Selection,"We examine the application of statistical model selection methods to reverse-engineering the control of galactose utilization in yeast from DNA microarray experiment data. In these experiments, relationships among gene expression values are revealed through modifications of galactose sugar level and genetic perturbations through knockouts. For each gene variable, we select predictors using a variety of methods, taking into account the variance in each measurement. These methods include maximization of log-likelihood with Cp, AIC, and BIC penalties, bootstrap and cross-validation error estimation, and coefficient shrinkage via the Lasso.",2005,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
Evaluation the structure of Sassanid era army,"This study has investigated the structure of Sassanid army. Sassanid Empire was the name of Persian family that was ruled from 224 until 651 AD about (427 years) over Iran. Sassanid Empire had a great army which in world of that day could defeat Iranian great opponent the Roman Empiremany times. The main and major part of their army was constituted by Eternal horsemen - ACHAEMENID relic â€“ but there is no information available about their number. Arms Riders combined with shield, helmet, armor, and other stuff that covers the head and hands, chest and feet. Horses also covered with metal components. Heavy cavalry arms of defensive weapons and it was the biggest advantage Sassanid army to the Parthian era. Cavalry weapons were bow and arrow, sword and mace and lasso hastate. The easiest part of Army was Infantry Regiment which mostly consisted of locals who had given guns. There were also elephants of war inthis army, sometimes was employed atback army to carry the combaters. In some other cases they were employed in the front the army in order to frighten the enemy horses and the Persians took advantage of this in the war with the Romans, Sassanid Flag, was the flag of KAVYAN - souvenir of the blacksmith KAVEH - and it was important to the Iranians.

Limited feedback for cognitive radio networks using compressed sensing,"In this paper, we consider the downlink of a cognitive radio network where a cognitive base station serves multiple cognitive users on the same frequency band as a group of primary transceivers. The cognitive base station uses an orthogonal scheduling scheme (TDMA/FDMA) to serve its users. For this purpose, the base station is interested in acquiring an estimate of the interference (from the primary network) power at each of its cognitive receivers as a measure of channel quality. This can be surely achieved if we allow for the feedback (from the cognitive receivers to the cognitive base station) bandwidth to scale linearly in the number of cognitive receivers, but in densely populated networks, the cost of such an acquisition might be too high. This leads us to the question of whether we can do better in terms of bandwidth efficiency. We observe that in many scenarios - that are common in practice - where the primary network exhibits sparse changes in transmit powers from one scheduling instant to the next, it is possible to acquire this interference state with only a logarithmic scaling in feedback bandwidth. More specifically, in cognitive networks where the channels are solely determined by the positions of nodes, we can use compressed sensing to recover the interference state. In addition to being a first application of compressed sensing in the domain of limited feedback, to the best of our knowledge, this paper makes a key mathematical contribution concerning the favourable sensing properties of path-loss matrices that are composed of nonzero mean, dependent random entries. Finally, we numerically study the robustness properties of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), a popular recovery algorithm, under two error models through simulations. The first model considers a varying amount of error added to all entries of the sensing matrix. The second one, a more adversarial model, considers a large amount of error added to only a fraction of the entries of the sensing matrix that are chosen uniformly at random. Simulation results establish that the LASSO recovery algorithm is robust to imperfect channel knowledge.",2010,"2010 48th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)"
Variable Selection and Shrinkage: Comparison of Some Approaches,"A common strategy within the framework of regression models is the selection of variables with possible predictive value, which are incorporated in the regression model. Two recently proposed methods, Breiman's Garotte (Breiman, 1995) and Tibshirani's Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) try to combine variable selection and shrinkage. We compare these with pure variable selection and shrinkage procedures. We consider the backward elimination procedure as a typical variable selection procedure and as an example of a shrinkage procedure an approach of Van Houwelingen and Le Cessie (1990). Additionally an extension of van Houwelingens and le Cessies approach proposed by Sauerbrei (1999) is considered. The ordinary least squares method is used as a reference. 
 
 
 
With the help of a simulation study we compare these approaches with respect to the distribution of the complexity of the selected model, the distribution of the shrinkage factors, selection bias, the bias and variance of the effect estimates and the average prediction error.",2001,Statistica Neerlandica
Predicting olivine composition using Raman spectroscopy through band shift and multivariate analyses,"Abstract Olivine group minerals are ubiquitous in extrusive igneous rocks and play an important role in constraining equilibria for samples in the upper mantle and above. All Raman spectra of the olivine group minerals in the solid solution between forsterite (Fo, Mg2SiO4) and fayalite (Fa, Fe2SiO4) have a high-intensity doublet between 800 and 880 cmâ€“1. Previous studies used small sample suites with limited compositional ranges and varying spectrometers to relate energy shifts of these two bands to Mg/Fe contents. In this work, Raman spectra of 93 olivine samples were acquired on either Brukerâ€™s 532 nm (laser wavelength) Senterra or BRAVO (785/852.3 nm) spectrometer. This paper compares the two-peak band shift univariate method with two multivariate methods: partial least squares (PLS) and the least absolute shrinkage operator (Lasso). Data sets from several instruments are also examined to assess the most accurate method for predicting olivine composition from a Raman spectrum. Our 181-spectra PLS model is recommended for use when determining olivine composition from a Raman spectrum. For Raman spectra of mixed phases where only the olivine doublet can be identified, composition can best be determined using the position of the peak ca. 838â€“857 cmâ€“1 through use of the regression equation %Fo = â€“0.179625x2 + 310.077x â€“133 717 (where x = DB2 centroid in units of cmâ€“1). In situ methods for predicting mineral composition on planetary surfaces are critically important to extraterrestrial exploration going forward; of these, Raman spectroscopy is likely the best, as shown by the impending deployment of several Raman instruments to Mars (ExoMars and Mars 2020). More broadly, application of machine learning methods to spectral data processing have implications to multiple fields that use spectroscopic data.",2017,American Mineralogist
Deep-sea nematode assemblages of the Clarion-Clipperton Nodule Province (Tropical North-Eastern Pacific),"The deep-sea nematode assemblages of the French mining claim area in the Clarion-Clipperton Nodule Province (the Northeastern Pacific Basin, 14Â°N, 130Â°W, depth 4,947â€“5,046Â m) were studied at species, genus and family levels. Material was obtained using multicorers and box corers. In total, 2,174 individuals from 14 stations and 21 samples were examined. The nematode assemblages from the nodule-bearing (NB) part of the sampling area differed significantly from those at the nodule-free (NN) section. The average nematode density was 103 inds/10Â cm2. The average nematode densities in the NB and NN parts were 69 inds/10Â cm2 and 137 inds/10Â cm2 respectively. Altogether, at least 325 putative species, 97 valid genera and 33 valid families were found. The real number of nematode species for the sampling area was estimated at about 510. The richest genera were Acantholaimus (33 putative species) and Thalassomonhystera (23 putative species). The proportions of juveniles, males and females among nematode individuals were about 44%, 23% and 33% respectively. About 2/3 of all nematodes were deposit-feeders and around 1/3 were epistrate-feeders. The nematode assemblage of the studied area may be considered to be a Theristus discolensisâ€“Thalassomonhystera sp.3 assemblage with variation of the dominant species. The dominant species at the NN site were Theristus discolensis (12.2%) and Thalassomonhystera sp. 3 (5.3%). In contrast, at the NB site, Thalassomonhystera sp. 3 was most abundant (14.1%), followed by T. discolensis (6.2%). At genus level, Thalassomonhystera (17.9%), Theristus (13.0%) and Acantholaimus (12.8%) dominated at the NN site, whereas the abundance of Theristus was half of that (6.4%) at the NB site. The most dominant families at the NN and NB sites were Xyalidae (28.1% and 16.6%, respectively), Monhysteridae (17.9% and 25.3%) and Chromadoridae (16.2% and 22.5%).",2009,Marine Biodiversity

Generalized Conditional Gradient for Sparse Estimation,"Structured sparsity is an important modeling tool that expands the applicability of convex formulations for data analysis, however it also creates significant challenges for efficient algorithm design. In this paper we investigate the generalized conditional gradient (GCG) algorithm for solving structured sparse optimization problems---demonstrating that, with some enhancements, it can provide a more efficient alternative to current state of the art approaches. After providing a comprehensive overview of the convergence properties of GCG, we develop efficient methods for evaluating polar operators, a subroutine that is required in each GCG iteration. In particular, we show how the polar operator can be efficiently evaluated in two important scenarios: dictionary learning and structured sparse estimation. A further improvement is achieved by interleaving GCG with fixed-rank local subspace optimization. A series of experiments on matrix completion, multi-class classification, multi-view dictionary learning and overlapping group lasso shows that the proposed method can significantly reduce the training cost of current alternatives.",2017,J.

Une intention de salut. Essais sur la poÃ©sie franÃ§aise moderne by John Naughton (review),"John Naughton, Une intention de salut. Essais sur la poesie francaise moderne. Amsterdam and New York: Rodopi, 2012. 235 pp. This is a work of genuine academic piety. John Naughton, who launched his career as interpreter of modern French poetry with a book on Yves Bonnefoy (1984), develops in his title and final chapter a moving and substantial analysis of Bonnefoy as the exemplar of a new (atheistic or agnostic) modern faith in five major poets--and he accomplishes this essentially ethical intent with meticulous textual analyses. Naughton is a sensitive, trustworthy guide. After an avant-propos explaining his own flexible relationship with traditional faith-based motivation, he provides a wide-ranging ""Introduction: La poesie moderne et la tradition chretienne"" (13-43), which anticipates his approaches to Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Claudel, Louis-Rene des Forets, and Yves Bonnefoy. Each chapter is self-contained and some repetition of crucial quotations strengthens the book's pedagogical unity. Following Yves Bonnefoy's assertion that ""Nous autres venons apres les dieux"" (41), Naughton explores how each poet adapts the three theological virtues of faith, hope, and love. He begins by tracing the French sanctification of the poet from Hugo through Bonnefoy and insists that ""Claudel est le seul a avoir vecu la foi sans equivoque"" (41). The following five chapters plunge into those ambiguities. Naughton makes a convincing case for Baudelaire's essentially religious, though anti-bourgeois, orientation. ""Le probleme Baudelaire"" (43-87)--with its trendy medieval genitive following Sainte-Beuve (see La Folie Baudelaire by Roberto Calasso; John E. Jackson, La Mort Baudelaire)--warns against identifying author and poetic persona. Referring to approaches of Bonnefoy, Pierre Emmanuel, Pierre Jean Jouve, Leo Bersani, Charles Mauron, Steve Murphy, and others, Naughton stresses the dialectic of reality and escapism, ""Une extase faite de volupte et de connaissance"" (72, Baudelaire's italics). Baudelaire's own analysis of ecstasy (70-74) was provoked in part by Wagner's overture to Lohengrin as well as the drug experience. The poet's compassion provides a transition to ""L'experience de la charite chez Rimbaud"" (83-105), itself a transition chapter that provides analyses of Une saison en enfer and Rimbaud's relationship with his mother, with Verlaine, and the influence of his absent father. The chapter concludes by citing Rimbaud's appeal to American readers such as Henry Miller and Jim Morrison of The Doors. Rimbaud in Africa also receives insightful treatment. The next two chapters--""La Foi selon Paul Claudel"" (107-146) and ""Louis-Rene des Forets, Agonistes,"" (147-183)--illuminates the contrast between Claudel's militant Catholicism and the profound secularism of Des Forets, whom Naughton knew personally, and to whom he devoted an important monograph (1993). Naughtons analysis of Claudel's theatre is sympathetic and attempts to rescue that powerful personality from disdain by literary historians--but not without a bold moral judgment: certes, il semble que Paul Claudel ait eu besoin de la forteresse que l'Eglise lui a fournie. La rigidite de ses doctrines, la coherence de son enseignement, la beaute de ses rites, la regularite de ses pratiques, repondaient a une necessite chez lui et le defendait de forces obscures mais reelles: le doute, la passion, le chaos, la folie. Son orgueil, ses impatiences, sa soif de certitudes sont autant de fortifications contre l'ennemi, contre la peur. â€¦",2013,French Forum
Three Statistical Methods for the Social Sciences,"Social sciences offer particular challenges to statistics due to difficulties such as conducting randomized experiments in this domain, the large variation in humans, the difficulty in collecting complete datasets, and the typically unstructured nature of data at the human scale. New technology allows for increased computation and data recording, which has in turn brought forth new innovations for analysis.Because of these challenges and innovations, statistics in the social sciences is currently thriving and vibrant.This dissertation is an argument for evaluating statistical methodology in the social sciences along four major axes: \emph{validity}, \emph{interpretability}, \emph{transparency}, and \emph{employability}. We illustrate how one might develop methods that achieve these four goals with three case studies.The first is an analysis of post-stratification, a form of covariate adjustment to evaluate treatment effect. In contrast to recent results showing that regression adjustment can be problematic under the Neyman-Rubin model, we show post-stratification, something that can easily done in, e.g., natural experiments, has a similar precision to a randomized block trail as long as there are not too many strata. The difference is $O(1/n^2)$. Post-stratification thus potentially allows for transparently exploiting predictive covariates and random mechanisms in observational data. This case study illustrates the value of analyzing a simple estimator under weak assumptions, and of finding similarities between different methodological approaches so as to leverage earlier findings to a new domain.We then present a framework for building statistical tools to extract topic-specific key-phrase summaries of large text corpora (e.g., the New York Times) and a human validation experiment to determine best practices for this approach. These tools, built from high-dimensional, sparse classifiers such as L1-logistic regression and the Lasso, can be used to, for example, translate essential concepts across languages, investigate massive databases of aviation reports, or understand how different topics of interest are covered by various media outlets. This case study demonstrates how more modern methods can be evaluated using external validation in order to demonstrate that they produce meaningful and comprehendible results that can be broadly used.The third chapter presents the trinomial bound, a new auditing technique for elections rooted in very minimal assumptions. We demonstrated the usability of this technique by, in November 2008, auditing contests in Santa Cruz and Marin counties, California.The audits were risk-limiting, meaning they had a pre-specified minimum chance of requiring a full hand count if the outcomes were wrong. The trinomial bound gave better results than the Stringer bound, a tool common in accounting for analyzing financial audit samples drawn with probability proportional to an error bound. This case study focuses on generating methods that are employable and transparent so as to serve a public need.Throughout, we argue that, especially in the difficult domain of the social sciences, we must spend extra attention on the first axis of validity. This motivates our using the Neyman-Rubin model for the analysis of post-stratification, our developing an approach for external, model-independent validation for the key-phrase extraction tools, and our minimal assumptions for election auditing.",2012,
"Generalised M-Lasso for robust, spatially regularised hurst estimation","A generalised Lasso iteratively reweighted scheme is here introduced to perform spatially regularised Hurst estimation on semi-local, weakly self-similar processes. This is extended further to the robust, heavy-tailed case whereupon the generalised M-Lasso is proposed. The design successfully incorporates both a spatial derivative in the generalised Lasso regulariser operator and a weight matrix formulated in the wavelet domain. The result simultaneously spatially smooths the Hurst estimates and downweights outliers. Experiments using a Hampel score function confirm that the method yields superior Hurst estimates in the presence of strong outliers. Moreover, it is shown that the inferred weight matrix can be used to perform wavelet shrinkage and denoise fractional Brownian surfaces in the presence of strong, localised, band-limited noise.",2015,2015 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)
