Comparing variable selection techniques for linear regression: LASSO and Autometrics,"In this paper, we compare two different variable selection approaches for linear regression models: Autometrics (automatic general-to-specific selection) and LASSO (?1-norm regularization). In a simulation study, we show the performance of the methods considering the predictive power (forecast out-of-sample) and the selection of the correct model and estimation (in-sample). The case where the number of candidate variables exceeds the number of observation is considered as well. We also analyze the properties of estimators comparing to the oracle estimator. Finally, we compare both methods in an application to GDP forecasting.",2013,
Restoring Public Debt Sustainability: The Role of Independent Fiscal Institutions,"Restoring Public Debt Sustainability: The Role of Independent Fiscal Institutions represents the first comprehensive survey of a new generation of independent fiscal institutions, established to promote transparency in public finances through real-time monitoring of the soundness of budgetary policymaking. The chapters, authored by heads of the institutions, as well as distinguished policy analysts and academics, explore the rationale and experience of these fiscal watchdogs. Consequently, useful lessons and implications are drawn for the design and practical operation of such institutions. The timeliness of the volume is underscored by the potential role of fiscal watchdogs in containing the public debt crisis that has engulfed a number of countries. Indeed, the recent proliferation of these institutions has been in response to the need for enhancing policy credibility of highly indebted governments in financial markets and, more generally, for strengthening the quality of economic governance. The first part of the book deals with key analytical and institutional issues: the political environment, the scope and limits of these institutions, the delegation of monetary policymaking to an independent body, and the implications of rising public indebtedness. The second part contains case studies of institutions that, for the most part, were born as a result of domestic political developments. The third part presents the experience of institutions whose origins can be traced directly or indirectly to an earlier or a recent financial crisis. The chapters are written from a multidisciplinary - economic, financial, political, legal - perspective, intended for academics, researchers, and practitioners alike.

Learning Efficient Sparse Structures in Speech Recognition,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially long short-term memories (LSTMs) have been widely used in speech recognition and natural language processing. As the sizes of RNN models grow for better performance, the computation cost and therefore the required hardware resource increase rapidly. We propose an efficient structural sparsity (ESS) learning method for acoustic modeling in speech recognition. ESS aims to generate a model that offers higher execution efficiency while maintaining the accuracy. A three-step training pipeline is developed in our work. First, we apply the group Lasso regularization method during training process and learn a structural sparse model from scratch. Then the learned sparse structures will be fixed and cannot be changed. Finally, we retrain the model and update the nonzero parameters in the model. We applied our ESS method on classic HMM+LSTM model on Kaldi toolkit. The experimental results show that ESS can remove 72.5% weight groups in the weight matrices when slightly increasing the word error rate (WER) 1.1%.",2019,"ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Feasible analysis of gene expression â€“a computational based classification for breast cancer,"Abstract Computational based classification of gene expression data for analyzing the genetic pattern provides better clinical prediction for breast cancer. Breast cancer is one of the leading cancers among women all over India. This type of cancer leads to malignant tumor developed in the breast. Recent methodologies have undergone many classification methods to analyze the characteristics of gene expression. This paper focuses on computational method such as fuzzy based logistic regression to predict the expression of the gene data. In order to bring accuracy and to solve the inefficiency in feature selection of gene expression data, LASSO Logistic Regression (LLR), a novel methodology is implemented. For computational tractable, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is implied with regression model. Diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer becomes a great challenge in the medical era. This research work explores the mining technology based algorithm to classify the cancer data using fuzzy methodology by evaluating few samples of gene expression data of breast cancer as a training set and the resultant test data are validated to predict the cancer at the earlier stage. For feasible analysis, Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is deployed for unknown or missing parameters of gene data expression.",2019,Measurement
Integration of gene expression and DNA-methylation profiles improves molecular subtype classification in acute myeloid leukemia,"BackgroundAcute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is characterized by various cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities. Detection of these abnormalities is important in the risk-classification of patients but requires laborious experimentation. Various studies showed that gene expression profiles (GEP), and the gene signatures derived from GEP, can be used for the prediction of subtypes in AML. Similarly, successful prediction was also achieved by exploiting DNA-methylation profiles (DMP). There are, however, no studies that compared classification accuracy and performance between GEP and DMP, neither are there studies that integrated both types of data to determine whether predictive power can be improved.ApproachHere, we used 344 well-characterized AML samples for which both gene expression and DNA-methylation profiles are available. We created three different classification strategies including early, late and no integration of these datasets and used them to predict AML subtypes using a logistic regression model with Lasso regularization.ResultsWe illustrate that both gene expression and DNA-methylation profiles contain distinct patterns that contribute to discriminating AML subtypes and that an integration strategy can exploit these patterns to achieve synergy between both data types. We show that concatenation of features from both data sets, i.e. early integration, improves the predictive power compared to classifiers trained on GEP or DMP alone. A more sophisticated strategy, i.e. the late integration strategy, employs a two-layer classifier which outperforms the early integration strategy.ConclusionWe demonstrate that prediction of known cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities in AML can be further improved by integrating GEP and DMP profiles.",2015,BMC Bioinformatics
Optimal Portfolio Selection using Regularization Marine Carrasco and NÃ©rÃ©e Noumon,"The mean-variance principle of Markowitz (1952) for portfolio selection gives disappointing results once the mean and variance are replaced by their sample counterparts. The problem is ampliÂ…ed when the number of assets is large and the sample covariance is singular or nearly singular. In this paper, we investigate four regularization techniques to stabilize the inverse of the covariance matrix: the ridge, spectral cut-oÂ¤, Landweber-Fridman and LARS Lasso. These four methods involve a tuning parameter that needs to be selected. The main contribution is to derive a data-driven method for selecting the tuning parameter in an optimal way, i.e. in order to minimize a quadratic loss function measuring the distance between the estimated allocation and the optimal one. The cross-validation type criterion takes a similar form for the four regularization methods. Preliminary simulations show that regularizing yields a higher out-of-sample performance than the sample based Markowitz portfolio and often outperforms the 1 over N equal weights portfolio. We thank Marc Henry for his helpful comments.",2010,
Efficient Approach to Correct Read Alignment for Pseudogene Abundance Estimates,"RNA-Sequencing has been the leading technology to quantify expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. The data analysis of an RNA-Seq experiment starts from aligning short reads to the reference genome/transcriptome or reconstructed transcriptome. However, current aligners lack the sensitivity to distinguish reads that come from homologous regions of an genome. One group of these homologies is the paralog pseudogenes. Pseudogenes arise from duplication of a set of protein coding genes, and have been considered as degraded paralogs in the genome due to their lost of functionality. Recent studies have provided evidence to support their novel regulatory roles in biological processes. With the growing interests in quantifying the expression level of pseudogenes at different tissues or cell lines, it is critical to have a sensitive method that can correctly align ambiguous reads and accurately estimate the expression level among homologous genes. Previously in PseudoLasso, we proposed a linear regression approach to learn read alignment behaviors, and to leverage this knowledge for abundance estimation and alignment correction. In this paper, we extend the work of PseudoLasso by grouping the homologous genomic regions into different communities using a community detection algorithm, followed by building a linear regression model separately for each community. The results show that this approach is able to retain the same accuracy as PseudoLasso. By breaking the genome into smaller homologous communities, the running time is improved from quadratic growth to linear with respect to the number of genes.",2017,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
Improvement of inspection system for common crossings by track side monitoring and prognostics,Scheduled inspections of common crossings are one of the main cost drivers of railway maintenance. Prognostics and health management (PHM) approach and modern monitoring means offer many possibilities in the optimization of inspections and maintenance. The present paper deals with data driven prognosis of the common crossing remaining useful life (RUL) that is based on an inertial monitoring system. The problem of scheduled inspections system for common crossings is outlined and analysed. The proposed analysis of inertial signals with the maximal overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MODWPT) and Shannon entropy (SE) estimates enable to extract the spectral features. The relevant features for the acceleration components are selected with application of Lasso (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regularization. The features are fused with time domain information about the longitudinal position of wheels impact and train velocities by multivariate regression. The fused structural health (SH) indicator has a significant correlation to the lifetime of crossing. The RUL prognosis is performed on the linear degradation stochastic model with recursive Bayesian update. Prognosis testing metrics show the promising results for common crossing inspection scheduling improvement.,2019,
"Discussion of 'Correlated variables in regression: Clustering and sparse estimation' by Peter BÃ¼hlmann, Philipp RÃ¼timann, Sara van de Geer and Cun-Hui Zhang","We would like to begin by congratulating the authors on their fine paper. Handling highly correlated variables is one of the most important issues facing practitioners in high-dimensional regression problems, and in some ways it is surprising that it has not received more attention up to this point. The authors have made substantial progress towards practical methodological proposals, however, and we are sure that the paper will stimulate considerable future research. In this discussion, we present a possible improvement to the cluster representative Lasso, give some further insights into the cluster group Lasso and conclude with some brief remarks on one possible new direction suggested by the work.",2013,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference
An Engineered Allele of afsQ1 Facilitates the Discovery and Investigation of Cryptic Natural Products.,"New approaches to antimicrobial discovery are needed to address the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. The Streptomyces genus, a proven source of antibiotics, is recognized as having a large reservoir of untapped secondary metabolic genes, many of which are likely to produce uncharacterized compounds. However, most of these compounds are currently inaccessible, as they are not expressed under standard laboratory conditions. Here, we present a novel methodology for activating these ""cryptic"" metabolites by heterologously expressing a constitutively active pleiotropic regulator. By screening wild Streptomyces isolates, we identified the antibiotic siamycin-I, a lasso peptide that we show is active against multidrug pathogens. We further revealed that siamycin-I interferes with cell wall integrity via lipid II. This new technology has the potential to be broadly applied for use in the discovery of additional ""cryptic"" metabolites.",2017,ACS chemical biology
Hyperspectral Imagery Classification via Stochastic HHSVMs,"Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) has shown promising results in real-world applications. However, the technological evolution of optical sensors poses two main challenges in HSI classification: 1) the spectral band is usually redundant and noisy and 2) HSI with millions of pixels has become increasingly common in real-world applications. Motivated by the recent success of hybrid huberized support vector machines (HHSVMs), which inherit the benefits of both lasso and ridge regression, this paper first investigates the advantages of HHSVM for HSI applications. Unfortunately, the existing HHSVM solvers suffer from prohibitive computational costs on large-scale data sets. To solve this problem, this paper proposes simple and effective stochastic HHSVM algorithms for HSI classification. In the stochastic settings, we show that with a probability of at least <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$1-\varrho $ </tex-math></inline-formula>, our algorithms find an <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\epsilon $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-accurate solution using <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\tilde {O}({1}/{\lambda _{2}\epsilon })$ </tex-math></inline-formula> iterations. Since the convergence rate of our algorithms does not depend on the size of the training set, our algorithms are suitable for handling large-scale problems. We demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms by conducting experiments on large-scale binary and multiclass classification problems, comparing to the state-of-the-art HHSVM solvers. Finally, we apply our algorithms to real HSI classification and achieve promising results.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing
Prediction of pneumonia hospitalization in adults using health checkup data,"OBJECTIVES
Community-acquired pneumonia is a common cause of hospitalization, and pneumococcal vaccinations are recommended for high-risk individuals. Although risk factors for pneumonia have been identified, there are currently no pneumonia hospitalization prediction models based on the risk profiles of healthy subjects. This study aimed to develop a predictive model for pneumonia hospitalization in adults to accurately identify high-risk individuals to facilitate the efficient prevention of pneumonia.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective database analysis using health checkup data and health insurance claims data for residents of Kyoto prefecture, Japan, between April 2010 and March 2015. We chose adults who had undergone health checkups in the first year of the study period, and tracked pneumonia hospitalizations over the next 5 years. Subjects were randomly divided into training and test sets. The outcome measure was pneumonia hospitalization, and candidate predictors were obtained from the health checkup data. The prediction model was developed and internally validated using a LASSO logistic regression analysis. Lastly, we compared the new model with comparative models.


RESULTS
The study sample comprised 54,907 people who had undergone health checkups. Among these, 921 were hospitalized for pneumonia during the study period. The c-statistic for the prediction model in the test set was 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.69-0.73). In contrast, a comparative model with only age and comorbidities as predictors had a lower c-statistic of 0.55 (95% confidence interval: 0.54-0.56).


CONCLUSIONS
Our predictive model for pneumonia hospitalization performed better than comparative models, and may be useful for supporting the development of pneumonia prevention measures.",2017,PLoS ONE
Semi-Local Scaling Exponent Estimation With Box-Penalty Constraints and Total-Variation Regularization.,"We here establish and exploit the result that 2D isotropic self-similar fields beget quasi-decorrelated wavelet coefficients and that the resulting localised log sample second moment statistic is asymptotically normal. This leads to the development of a semi-local scaling exponent estimation framework with optimally modified weights. Furthermore, recent interest in penalty methods for least square problems and generalized Lasso for scaling exponent estimation inspires the simultaneous incorporation of both bounding box constraints and total variation smoothing into an iteratively reweighted least-square estimator framework. Numerical results on fractional Brownian fields with global and piecewise constant, semi-local Hurst parameters illustrate the benefits of the new estimators.",2016,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society
Harpoon selection: efficient selections for ungrouped content on large pen-based surfaces,"In this paper, we present the Harpoon selection tool, a novel selection technique specifically designed for interactive whiteboards. The tool combines area cursors and crossing to perform complex selections amongst a large number of unsorted, ungrouped items. It is optimized for large-scale pen-based surfaces and works well in both dense and sparse surroundings. We describe a list of key features relevant to the design of the tool and provide a detailed description of both the mechanics as well as the feedback of the tool. The results of a user study are described and analyzed to confirm our design. The study shows that the Harpoon tool performs significantly faster than Tapping and Lassoing.",2011,
Classâ€specific variable selection in highâ€dimensional discriminant analysis through Bayesian Sparsity,"Although the ongoing digital revolution in fields such as chemometrics, genomics or personalized medicine gives hope for considerable progress in these areas, it also provides more and more high-dimensional data to analyze and interpret. A common usual task in those fields is discriminant analysis, which however may suffer from the high dimensionality of the data. The recent advances, through subspace classification or variable selection methods, allowed to reach either excellent classification performances or useful visualizations and interpretations. Obviously, it is of great interest to have both excellent classification accuracies and a meaningful variable selection for interpretation. This work addresses this issue by introducing a subspace discriminant analysis method which performs a class-specific variable selection through Bayesian sparsity. The resulting classification methodology is called sparse high-dimensional discriminant analysis (sHDDA). Contrary to most sparse methods which are based on the Lasso, sHDDA relies on a Bayesian modeling of the sparsity pattern and avoids the painstaking and sensitive cross-validation of the sparsity level. The main features of sHDDA are illustrated on simulated and real-world data. In particular, we propose an exemplar application to cancer characterization based on medical imaging using radiomic feature extraction is in particular proposed.",2019,Journal of Chemometrics
Incorporating scientific knowledge into phenotype development: penalized latent class regression.,"The field of psychiatric genetics is hampered by the lack of a clear taxonomy for disorders. Building on the work of Houseman and colleagues (Feature-specific penalized latent class analysis for genomic data. Harvard University Biostatistics Working Paper Series, Working Paper 22, 2005), we describe a penalized latent class regression aimed at allowing additional scientific information to influence the estimation of the measurement model, while retaining the standard assumption of non-differential measurement. In simulation studies, ridge and LASSO penalty functions improved the precision of estimates and, in some cases of differential measurement, also reduced bias. Class-specific penalization enhanced separation of latent classes with respect to covariates, but only in scenarios where there was a true separation. Penalization proved to be less computationally intensive than an analogous Bayesian analysis by a factor of 37. This methodology was then applied to data from normal elderly subjects from the Cache County Study on Memory and Aging. Addition of APO-E genotype and a number of baseline clinical covariates improved the dementia prediction utility of the latent classes; application of class-specific penalization improved precision while retaining that prediction utility. This methodology may be useful in scenarios with large numbers of collinear covariates or in certain cases where latent class model assumptions are violated. Investigation of novel penalty functions may prove fruitful in further refining psychiatric phenotypes.",2011,Statistics in medicine
Least Angle Regression in Tangent Space and LASSO for Generalized Linear Model,"We propose sparse estimation methods for the generalized linear models, which run Least Angle Regression (LARS) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in the tangent space of the manifold of the statistical model. Our approach is to roughly approximate the statistical model and to subsequently use exact calculations. LARS was proposed as an efficient algorithm for parameter estimation and variable selection for the normal linear model. The LARS algorithm is described in terms of Euclidean geometry with regarding correlation as metric of the space. Since the LARS algorithm only works in Euclidean space, we transform a manifold of the statistical model into the tangent space at the origin. In the generalized linear regression, this transformation allows us to run the original LARS algorithm for the generalized linear models. The proposed methods are efficient and perform well. Real-data analysis shows that the proposed methods output similar results as that of the $l_1$-penalized maximum likelihood estimation for the generalized linear models. Numerical experiments show that our methods work well and they can be better than the $l_1$-penalization for the generalized linear models in generalization, parameter estimation, and model selection.",2019,ArXiv
Online Static Security Assessment of Power Systems Based on Lasso Algorithm,"As one important means of ensuring secure operation in a power system, the contingency selection and ranking methods need to be more rapid and accurate. A novel method-based least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) algorithm is proposed in this paper to apply to online static security assessment (OSSA). The assessment is based on a security index, which is applied to select and screen contingencies. Firstly, the multi-step adaptive Lasso (MSA-Lasso) regression algorithm is introduced based on the regression algorithm, whose predictive performance has an advantage. Then, an OSSA module is proposed to evaluate and select contingencies in different load conditions. In addition, the Lasso algorithm is employed to predict the security index of each power system operation state with the consideration of bus voltages and power flows, according to Newton-Raphson load flow (NRLF) analysis in post-contingency states. Finally, the numerical results of applying the proposed approach to the IEEE 14-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus test systems demonstrate the accuracy and rapidity of OSSA.",2018,ArXiv
Construction of Quantitative Transaction Strategy Based on LASSO and Neural Network,"Since the establishment of the securities market, there has been a continuous search for the prediction of stock price trend. Based on the forecasting characteristics of stock index futures, this paper combines the variable selection in the statistical field and the machine learning to construct an effective quantitative trading strategy. Firstly, the LASSO algorithm is used to filter a large number of technical indexes to obtain reasonable and effective technical indicators. Then, the indicators are used as input variables, and the average expected return rate is predicted by neural network. Finally, based on the forecasting results, a reasonable quantitative trading strategy is constructed. We take the CSI 300 stock index futures trading data for empirical research. The results show that the variables selected by LASSO are effective and the introduction of LASSO can improve the generalization ability of neural network. At the same time, the quantitative trading strategy based on LASSO algorithm and neural network can achieve good effect and robustness at different times.",2017,Applied Economics and Finance
The Visual Arts at the Biennial Burkinabe National Cultural Week,"Every two years the Ministry of Arts, Culture, and Tourism of Burkina Faso organises a National Cultural Week in Bobo Dioulasso.
Its main objectives are to develop and promote Burkinabe culture and artists. This event, which includes numerous domains of
art, nevertheless remains quite obviously a framework for the development and promotion of the performing arts in particular.
The visual or fine arts do not seem to have found in this event the means of expression whereby their development can best be
promoted. The constraining factors for this category of art are the confusion that exists between traditional and contemporary art,
the anonymity of visual artists, the absence of a theme around which the competition can be organised and the unfortunate fate
reserved for prize-winning art works and artists. Proposals for solutions are made here in the hope that these will enable the
National Cultural Week to become the springboard for the development of the visual arts. Keywords : Burkinabe National

The gut microbiome but not the resistome is associated with urogenital schistosomiasis in preschool-aged children,"Helminth parasites have been shown to have systemic effects in the host. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we characterise the gut microbiome and resistome of 113 Zimbabwean preschool-aged children (1â€“5 years). We test the hypothesis that infection with the human helminth parasite, Schistosoma haematobium, is associated with changes in gut microbial and antimicrobial resistance gene abundance/diversity. Here, we show that bacteria phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and fungi phyla Ascomycota, Microsporidia, Zoopagomycota dominate the microbiome. The abundance of Proteobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota differ between schistosome-infected versus uninfected children. Specifically, infection is associated with increases in Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Derxia, Thalassospira, Aspergillus, Tricholoma, and Periglandula, with a decrease in Azospirillum. We find 262 AMR genes, from 12 functional drug classes, but no association with individual-specific data. To our knowledge, we describe a novel metagenomic dataset of Zimbabwean preschool-aged children, indicating an association between urogenital schistosome infection and changes in the gut microbiome. Osakunor et al. show that infection of Zimbabwean preschool-aged children with Schistosoma haematobium correlates with abundance changes in Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Derxia, Thalassospira, Aspergillus, Tricholoma, Periglandula, and Azospirillum. This study provides a microbiome and resistome dataset of African preschool-aged children.",2020,Communications Biology
Discovery and structure of the antimicrobial lasso peptide citrocin,"We report the identification of citrocin, a 19-amino acid-long antimicrobial lasso peptide from the bacteria Citrobacter pasteurii and Citrobacter braakii. We refactored the citrocin gene cluster and heterologously expressed it in Escherichia coli. We determined citrocin's NMR structure in water and found that is reminiscent of that of microcin J25 (MccJ25), an RNA polymerase-inhibiting lasso peptide that hijacks the TonB-dependent transporter FhuA to gain entry into cells. Citrocin has moderate antimicrobial activity against E. coli and Citrobacter strains. We then performed an in vitro RNA polymerase (RNAP) inhibition assay using citrocin and microcin J25 against E. coli RNAP. Citrocin has a higher minimal inhibition concentration than microcin J25 does against E. coli but surprisingly is âˆ¼100-fold more potent as an RNAP inhibitor. This suggests that citrocin uptake by E. coli is limited. We found that unlike MccJ25, citrocin's activity against E. coli relied on neither of the two proton motive force-linked systems, Ton and Tolâ€“Pal, for transport across the outer membrane. The structure of citrocin contains a patch of positive charge consisting of Lys-5 and Arg-17. We performed mutagenesis on these residues and found that the R17Y construct was matured into a lasso peptide but no longer had activity, showing the importance of this side chain for antimicrobial activity. In summary, we heterologously expressed and structurally and biochemically characterized an antimicrobial lasso peptide, citrocin. Despite being similar to MccJ25 in sequence, citrocin has an altered activity profile and does not use the same outer-membrane transporter to enter susceptible cells.",2019,The Journal of Biological Chemistry
Efficient Learning of Timeseries Shapelets,"In timeseries classification, shapelets are subsequences of timeseries with high discriminative power. Existing methods perform a combinatorial search for shapelet discovery. Even with speedup heuristics such as pruning, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, the search remains computationally expensive. In this paper, we take an entirely different approach and reformulate the shapelet discovery task as a numerical optimization problem. In particular, the shapelet positions are learned by combining the generalized eigenvector method and fused lasso regularizer to encourage a sparse and blocky solution. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is orders of magnitudes faster than the state-of-the-art shapelet-based methods, while achieving comparable or even better classification accuracy.",2016,

"Oxygen Uptake during Environmental Temperature Change in Hermit Crabs: Adaptation to Subtidal, Intertidal, and Supratidal Habitats","Changes in oxygen uptake in response to stepwise changes in environmental temperature have been measured in anomuran decapod Crustacea inhabiting a subtidal habitat (Paguristes turgidus, Elassochirus tenuimanus), an intertidal habitat (Pagurus granusimanus, Pagurus hirsutisculus) and a supratidal habitat (Coenobita clypeatus, Coenobita rugosus). Individuals of each species were housed in respirometers and subjected to three rapid, progressive 5 C increases above their initial acclimation temperature, with $\dot{M}_{O_{2}}$ (Î¼M Oâ‚‚/g/h) measured during a 2-3-h pause at each temperature increment. The $Q_{10}$ for $\dot{M}_{O_{2}}$ is correlated with habitat, with intertidal species having a $Q_{10}$ of 1.4-1.6, which is significantly lower (P < .05) when compared with $Q_{10}$ values of 2.1-2.4 for subtidal species and 2.6-2.7 for the supratidal forms. Intertidal hermit crabs also showed a smaller $\dot{M}_{O_{2}}$ overshoot and a more rapid $\dot{M}_{O_{2}}$ acclimation to abrupt temperature change compare...",1981,Physiological and Biochemical Zoology
Benefits of Mud/clay and Thermal Spring Water in the Human Health,"The appropriate use of minerals and other mineral resources in geomedicine can reduce both pharmacs consumption and the number of working days people miss due to health problems. The main goal of the present communication is the study of the muds/clays being used in Portugal for health treatments, outdoors in the geological sites where they naturally occur or indoors in Thalassotherapy Centres or in Thermal Spas. Portugal is rich in excellent minero -medicinal waters, some of them of marked thermal character. Their diversity is great, in terms of chemical and physical properties, and they are being the object of a fine characterisation programme by the authors of the present communication. Such characterisation has started with Vale das Furnas, S. Miguel island, Azores archipelago, where more than two dozens of springs of hyperthermal, mesothermal and hypothermal waters do occur. Some of the hyperthermal springs deposit muds that are being used in the treatment of certain diseases. The experimental data available so far allowed us to conclude that all the studied clays/muds have good potentialities to be used for specific mudtherapy applications. The appropriate use of minerals and other mineral resources in geomedicine can reduce both pharmacs consumption and the number of working days people miss due to health problems.",2010,
Canonical Correlation and Regression Analyses of Globular Clusters in Milky Way Galaxy,"Study about complex relationships between different characteristics of an astronomical object is a momentous research topic in Astronomy as well as Astrostatistics. Correlation and regression analyses are the techniques which can quantify such relationships. A study on the relationships between different parameters of globular clusters in the Milky Way is used to uncover the formation and evolution of the Milky Way galaxy. We consider a
sample of 134 globular clusters in the Milky Way galaxy from the current catalog of globular clusters (2010 edition) compiled by William E. Harris. We have divided the globular clusters under study into three subpopulations (metal-rich disk, metal-poor disk, and metal-poor halo) according to the mixing proportion values of the fitted mixture model on metallicity values of clusters and distance from the galactic center. We investigate relationships between different parameter sets in different subpopulations using Canonical Correlation Analysis via Projection Pursuit (CCAPP) and Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) using Radial Basis kernel function. According to the findings of CCAPP and KCCA, photometric and
structural parameter sets are highly associated. For the more elaborate study about these relationships, we have considered Multiple Regression Analysis with structure parameters as explanatory variables and cluster luminosity as response variables. We face multicollinearity problems (using variance inflation factor) among structure parameters and fit regression models specially designed for tackling multicollinearity problem (Ridge, LASSO or Elastic net). It has been found that some structure parameters have nonlinear relationships with cluster luminosity and we have explained such nonlinear relationships using polynomial regression models.",2019,International journal of applied mathematics and statistics
An accurate regression of developmental stages for breast cancer based on transcriptomic biomarkers.,"AIM
Breast cancers at different stages have tremendous differences on both phenotypic and molecular patterns. The developmental stage is an essential factor in the clinical decision of treatment plans, but was usually formulated as a classification problem, which ignored the consecutive relationships among them.


MATERIALS & METHODS
This study proposed a regression-based procedure to detect the stage biomarkers of breast cancers. Biomarkers were detected by the Lasso and Ridge algorithms.


RESULTS & CONCLUSION
A collaboration duet of Lasso and Ridge regression algorithms achieved the best performances, with classification accuracy (Acc) equal to 0.8294 and regression goodness-of-fit (R2) equal toÂ 0.7810. The 265 biomarker genes were enriched with the signal peptide-based secretion function with the Bonferroni-corrected p-value equal to 6.9408e-3 and false discovery rate (FDR) equal to 1.1614e-2.",2019,Biomarkers in medicine
Examining the Effect of Reduction of Predictors Affecting the Survival Time of HIV/ AIDS Patients using a Multiple Correlation/ Association Technique,"The main objective of this paper is to reduce the number of predictors using multiple correlation/ association while estimating the survival of HIV/AIDS. MANOVA is used to test the association when we have two or more continuous predictors and two or more categorical predictors. Also, log-linear models are used to test the joint independence of two or more predictors. The survival times are estimated using AFTM. It is observed that the estimated survival times are not affected by the reduction of predictors from 11 to 4. Also, the estimates so obtained are more efficient as they have reduced standard error. Results of the proposed reduction method were also compared with the results of the two existing variable reduction methods, viz, LASSO and Net- Elastic method.",2018,The Journal of communicable diseases

RNA expression profiling was performed using microarray gene expression data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus, followed by the identification of breast cancerâ€‘related preserved modules using weighted gene coâ€‘expression network (WGCNA) network analysis. From the lncRNAs identified in these preserved modules, prognostic lncRNAs were selected using univariate Cox regression analysis in combination with the L1â€‘penalized (LASSO) Coxâ€‘proportional Hazards (Coxâ€‘PH) model. A risk score based on these prognostic lncRNAs was calculated and used for risk stratification. Differentially expressed RNAs (DERs) in breast cancer were identified using MetaDE. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis pathway enrichment analysis was conducted for these prognostic lncRNAs and the DERs related to the lncRNAs in the preserved modules. A total of five preserved modules comprising 73 lncRNAs were mined. An eightâ€‘lncRNA signature (IGHA1, IGHGP, IGKV2â€‘28, IGLL3P, IGLV3â€‘10, AZGP1P1, LINC00472 and SLC16A6P1) was identified using the LASSO Coxâ€‘PH model. Risk score based on these eight lncRNAs could classify breast cancer patients into two groups with significantly different survival times. The eightâ€‘lncRNA signature was validated using three independent cohorts. These prognostic lncRNAs were significantly associated with the cell adhesion molecules pathway, JAKâ€‘signal transducer and activator of transcriptionÂ 5A pathway, and erbb pathway and are potentially involved in regulating angiotensin II receptor typeÂ 1, neuropeptideÂ Y receptorÂ Y1, KISS1 receptor, and Câ€‘C motif chemokine ligandÂ 5. The developed eightâ€‘lncRNA signature may have clinical implications for predicting prognosis in breast cancer. Overall, this study provided possible molecular targets for the development of novel therapies against breast cancer.",2019,International Journal of Molecular Medicine

Random intercept selection in structured additive regression models,"This paper discusses random intercept selection within the context of semiparametric regression models with structured additive predictor (STAR). STAR models can deal simultaneously with nonlinear covariate effects and time trends, unit- or cluster-specific heterogeneity, spatial heterogeneity and complex interactions between covariates of different type. The random intercept selection is based on spike and slab priors for the variances of the random intercept coefficients. The aim is to achieve shrinkage of small random intercept coefficients to zero similar as for the LASSO in frequentist linear models. The mixture structure of the spike and slab prior allows for selective shrinkage, as coefficients are either heavily shrunk under the spike component or left almost unshrunk under the slab component. The hyperparameters of the spike and slab prior are chosen by theoretical considerations based on the prior inclusion probability of a particular random coefficient given the true effect size. Using extensive simulation experiments we compare random intercept models based on spike and slab priors for variances with the usual Inverse Gamma priors. A case study on malnutrition of children in Zambia illustrates the methodology in a real data example.",2015,
High-dimensional regression mixture models to perform clustering - application to electricity dataset.,"Model-based clustering is useful to understand how data is grouped. We propose to introduce the Lasso-MLE procedure, which uses finite mixture regression models to perform model-based clustering, on electricity dataset. To improve electricity consumption prediction, we cluster together consumers who have the same reliance between two successive days. To deal with functional datasets (response and regressors) we use the wavelet coefficients rather than the discretization. Then, we construct a model collection with more or less components and more or less relevant variables, and select some with the slope heuristic. Relevant variables are detected with the Lasso estimator, whereas we refit estimators with the maximum likelihood estimator. We run this procedure on Thursday 5 and Wednesday 6 January 2010. We analyze clusters done by the procedure with usual electricity consumption criterion, as the temperature, and the tarifs among others.",2015,International Federation of Classification Societies
Accelerated Block Coordinate Descent for Sparse Group Lasso,"In this work we transfer several recent acceleration techniques for the FISTA algorithm for composite convex opti- mization to the context of problems amenable to be solved by Block Coordinate Descent and, in particular, we show how these improvements can be used to speed up the training of the Sparse Group Lasso model. Experiments in several real life datasets illustrate how the proposed method can outperform the state of the art approach in terms of both the number of inner FISTA and outer block iterations required and, more importantly, the number of function and gradient evaluations needed to achieve a certain precision.",2018,2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)
Three essays on applications of machine learning in problems with high dimensional data,"The amount of data businesses collecting from the internet is massive. Researchers and analysts can now track various data features generated from log files, such as customersâ€™ behavior history, product descriptions and aggregate level data. etc. In an ideal scenario, such data could be represented in a spreadsheet, with columns representing each dimension. In practice, the number of data dimensions can be staggering, making data processing difficult. With high dimensional data, the number of features can be more than the number of observations, and it can be very challenging for traditional econometric method to handle this scenario. My dissertation addresses this data issue by applying machine learning techniques, including LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), decision trees, and neural networks, to help decision makers perform descriptive-predictive, and prescriptive analytics based on high dimensional data. My dissertation comprises three essays. The first essay applies tree based machine learning models (random forest and gradient boosting decision tree) and free text information to predict house prices and understand how certain factors could affect the prices. In the second essay, I propose a LASSO method in high dimensional data and use daily prices of hotels to understand hotelâ€™s competition pattern in a certain area. In the third essay, a word embedding and neural network model is applied to real estate data to more efficiently extract free text information, which leads to more accurate of house prices. In these essays, I apply and extend a variety of analytic tools including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, statistics, and econometric methods. These essays contribute to the applied econometric and business analytics literature and can help researchers and analysts",2019,
Utility of Genetic Testing in Addition to Mammography for Determining Risk of Breast Cancer Depends on Patient Age,"While screening and treatment have sharply reduced breast cancer mortality in the past 50 years, more targeted diagnostic testing may improve the accuracy and efficiency of care. Our retrospective, age-matched, case-control study evaluated the differential value of mammography and genetic variants to predict breast cancer depending on patient age. We developed predictive models using logistic regression with group lasso comparing (1) diagnostic mammography findings, (2) selected genetic variants, and (3) a combination of both. For women older than 60, mammography features were most predictive of breast cancer risk (imaging AUC = 0.74, genetic variants AUC = 0.54, combined AUC = 0.71). For women younger than 60 there is additional benefit to obtaining genetic testing (imaging AUC = 0.69, genetic variants AUC = 0.70, combined AUC = 0.72). In summary, genetic testing supplements mammography in younger women while mammography appears sufficient in older women for breast cancer risk prediction.",2018,AMIA Summits on Translational Science Proceedings
A re-evaluation of the ichthyodeterrent role of prostaglandins in the Caribbean gorgonian coral Plexaura homomalla,"Previous investigations have indicated that the Caribbean gorgonian coral Plexaura homomalla derives a chemical defense from prostaglandins present at high concentrations w~th in the coral's soft tissues. These conclusions were based on laboratory and field experiments with the hydroxy acids of prostaglandin A2 (PGA2), and not the acetoxy methyl esters of PGA2 that are present in the living gorgonian. In the present study, the consumption of food strips containing the acetoxy methyl ester of 15(R) PGA, from P. homomalla by a natural assemblage of Caribbean coral reef fishes did not differ from consumption of control stnps. In support of previous findings, treatment with the acetoxy acid, hydroxy methyl ester and hydroxy acid of 15(R) PGA2 inhibited consumption of food strips by reef fishes. Although the acetoxy methyl esters of PGA2 undergo hydrolysis when the soft tissues of P. homomalla are damaged, the process appears to be too slow to provide the gorgonian with an effective inducible defense mechanism. Some species of Caribbean gorgonian corals of the genus Plexaura (in particular, P. homomalla) contain high concentrations of prostaglandins within their soft tissues; estimates range from 1 to 8 % of wet tissue weight (Schneider et al. 1977, Domingez et al. 1980) and 1 to 2 O/O of dry tissue weight (Weinheimer & Spraggins 1969). Non-esterified prostaylandins mediate a variety of biological responses, particularly in mammals, and are generally found in only trace concentrations in animal tissues (Nomura & Ogata 1976). The biological function of such high concentrations of these compounds in the tissues of P. homomalla is unknown, particularly because CO-occurring species of gorgonians do not contain prostaglandins in appreciable amounts. Equally noteworthy, fully-esterified prostaglandin A2 (PGA2; Fig. ID), the most abundant Present address: Friday Harbor Laboratones, University of Washington, 620 Unlverslty Road, Friday Harbor, Washington 98250.

Structures of the 3 denvatives assayed In this study are also indicated (B, C , D) prostaglandin in the tissues of P. homomalla, occurs predominantly in the 15(R) isomer rather than the 15(S) form found in all other animal tissues. The 15(R) isomer is much less active than the 15(S) in representative pharmacological assays (Spraggins 1972). Gerhart (1984) tested the hypothesis that the prostaglandins in Plexaura homomalla function as a chemical defense against predatory reef fishes. He found that both the 15(S) and 15(R) isomers of unesterified PGA2 induced regurgitation in the yellowhead wrasse Halichoeres garnoti in feeding experiments conducted on coral reefs off Curasao, and obtained similar results in laboratory assays with the killifish Fundulus heteroclitis (Gerhart 1984). As Gerhart pointed out, however, the compounds used in his assays were the hydroxy acids of 15(S) and 15(R) PGA2 (Fig. 1A) (Gerhart 1984, p. 183), while the acetoxy methyl esters (Fig. ID) of these compounds are the sole derivatives stored in the living tissues of the gorgonian (Schneider et al. 1977). Gerhart jus96 Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 52: 95-98. 1989 tified his use of the hydroxy acids because they are the ultimate products of enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetoxy methyl esters after the coral tissue is damaged; however, completion of this process is reported to take -24 h (Schneider et al. 1977). Gerhart (1986) also tested the hypotheses that prostaglandins function as allelopathic agents or as inhibitors of blofouling of Plexaura homomalla. He found little or no PGA2 in the seawater surrounding colonies of P. homomalla, and neither isomer of PGA2 inhibited the fouling of gorgonian axial skeletons. It is unclear whether the hydroxy acids or acetoxy methyl esters of PGAl were employed in the fouling assays. In a survey of the chemical defenses of Caribbean gorgonian corals, we found that extracts of most of the gorgonian species of the genus Plexaura were palatable to the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum in laboratory assays (Pawlik et al. 1987). One sample, Plexaura sp. voucher No. 29, yielded an extract containing esterified prostaglandins. This extract was unpalatable in preliminary assays, but did not significantly deter fish feeding in more rigorous assays conducted at diminishing concentrations (Pawlik et al. 1987, Table 11). The purpose of the present study was to ascertain whether naturally-occurring prostaglandins contained in the tissues of P, homomalla (i.e., the acetoxy methyl esters) provide an effective chemical defense against a natural assemblage of predatory reef fishes in field assays. Materials and methods. Prostaglandins employed in the assays were purified from a frozen, crude dichloromethane extract of Plexaura homomalla collected in August 1983 a t Acklins Island, Bahamas. The gorgonians had been air-dried prior to extraction. Extracts contained a mixture of the acetoxy methyl ester, hydroxy methyl ester and hydroxy acid (approximate ratio of 2 : 1: 1, respectively) of 15(R) PGA2 (Fig. l) , as identified by NMR spectroscopy The 15(S) isomer of PGA2 was not detected. The prostaglandins in the extract were purified by flash chromatography on silica gel employing a 0 to 100 O/O ethyl acetate in iso-octane gradient, followed by silica gel HPLC on a preparative column with 2: 1 hexanes:ethyl acetate as the eluant. A portion of the purified hydroxy acid was acetylated with acetic anhydride in pyridine to yield the acetoxy acid (Fig. 1C). Purified samples were kept frozen for the 1 to 2 wk prior to use in field assays. Extracted, esterified prostaglandins were stable to further hydrolysis. Field assays were conducted near Looe Key Reef, south of Big Pine Key. Florida, USA, in September 1987. Prostaglandins were incorporated into a matrix of 4 % carageenan in the form of 1.0 X 0.5 X 5.0 cm strips (Harvell 81 Fenical 1988). Each strip enclosed a length of cotton string that protruded from one end of the strip. Strips were made by adding water to 2.5 g carageenan (Gelcann, FF961L; FMC Corp., Philadelphia) and 0.6 g freeze-dried brine shrimp (Artemia sp.) to a total volume of 60 m1 and heating the mixture to boiling. To this mixture, 1.5 g of prostaglandin were added in a minimal amount of ethanol. The mixture was stirred and then poured into plastic molds crossed by lengths of cotton string. After the matrix cooled and gelled, the strips were sliced to size with a scalpel and removed from the mold. Control strips contained an equivalent volume of ethanol, but no prostaglandin. The assay concentration of 1.5 g prostaglandin in a 60 m1 carageenan mixture (-2.5 O/O by volume) is a high value relative to the levels of prostaglandins found in Plexaura homomalla. We calculated -0.86 g of dry P homomalla tissue per m1 of wet tissue volume (excluding gorgonin axial skeleton). Assuming that 2 O/O of the dry weight of the gorgonin is composed of prostaglandins (Weinheimer & Spraggins 1969), then 60 m1 of this tissue would contain -1.0 g of prostaglandins (-1.7 % by volume). Prostaglandin concentrations of -2.5 % by volume (-3 O/O dry weight) would be at the upper limit of their natural concentration in P. homomalla. Therefore, any conclusions drawn from assays conducted at this concentration on the ineffectiveness of the compounds to deter predation would be conservative. One treatment and one control strip each were affixed to a 50 cm length of 3-strand nylon rope (at a distance of -4 and 14 cm from one end) by tying the cotton string protruding from each strip through the strands of the rope. Twenty such ropes were deployed on the reef for each experiment, with the end of each rope opposite the food strips unwound and clamped onto a piece of coral or rock at 10 to 15 m water depth. After 1 to 4 h, the ropes were retrieved from the reef and the amount of each strip eaten was recorded as a percentage decrease in the strip eaten was recorded as a percentage decrease in the strip length (to the nearest 5 %). Strip length was adjusted for bites taken out of the edges of the strip (see Hay 1984, for a detailed discussion of these assay methods). The Wilcoxon paired-sample test (one-tailed, Zar 1984) was employed to analyze the assay results after first excluding pairs for which both control and treatment slices had been either completely eaten, or not eaten at all. Results and discussion. In support of Gerhart's (1984) results, the hydroxy acid of 15(R) PGA2 from Plexaura homomalla (Fig. 1A) inhibited the feeding of a natural assemblage of reef fishes (Fig. 2A). The principal reef fishes observed feeding on assay strips were wrasses, primarily Thalassoma bifasaatum, and 2 or 3 species of Halichoeres. Damselfishes, Abudefduf sp. in particular, were occasionally observed biting at the strips.

Sparsest representations and approximations of an underdetermined linear system,"In an underdetermined linear system of equations, constrained l1 minimization methods such as the basis pursuit or the lasso are often used to recover one of the sparsest representations or approximations of the system. The null space property is a sufficient and ""almost"" necessary condition to recover a sparsest representation with the basis pursuit. Unfortunately, this property cannot be easily checked. On the other hand, the mutual coherence is an easily checkable sufficient condition insuring the basis pursuit to recover one of the sparsest representations. Because the mutual coherence condition is too strong, it is hardly met in practice. Even if one of these conditions holds, to our knowledge, there is no theoretical result insuring that the lasso solution is one of the sparsest approximations. In this article, we study a novel constrained problem that gives, without any condition, one of the sparsest representations or approximations. To solve this problem, we provide a numerical method and we prove its convergence. Numerical experiments show that this approach gives better results than both the basis pursuit problem and the reweighted l1 minimization problem.",2018,Inverse Problems
An improved variable selection procedure for adaptive Lasso in high-dimensional survival analysis,"Motivated by high-dimensional genomic studies, we develop an improved procedure for adaptive Lasso in high-dimensional survival analysis. The proposed procedure effectively reduces the false discoveries while successfully maintaining the false negative proportions, which improves the existing adaptive Lasso procedures. The implementation of the proposed procedure is straightforward and it is sufficiently flexible to accommodate large-scale problems where traditional procedures are impractical. To quantify the uncertainty of variable selection and control the family-wise error rate, a multiple sample-splitting based testing algorithm is developed. The practical utility of the proposed procedure are examined through simulation studies. The methods developed are then applied to a multiple myeloma data set.",2019,Lifetime Data Analysis
One hundred years of rapakivi granite,"SummaryRapakivi granites, recently redefined as A-type granites showing rapakivi texture at least in the larger batholiths, occur on all continents and presumably represent the most voluminous continental silicic intraplate magmatism on Earth. Most of the rapakivi granites are Proterozoic (mainly 1.0 to 1.7 Ga) but also Archean (2.8 Ga) and Phanerozoic (0.05 to 0.4 Ga) are known. The magmatic association is bimodal comprising anorthosite to gabbro, diabase, minor Fe-enriched intermediate rocks, and monzonite, beside granite; mingling of silicic and mafic magmas is typical. Geochemically and otherwise, rapakivi granites show the characteristics of the Phanerozoic A-type granites, except that they encompass relatively few peralkaline rocks and that they may occur as very large (up to 40,000 km2) batholiths. Some of the rapakivi granite complexes host important Sn-polymetallic and Fe-Cu deposits.The rapakivi granites crystallized from relatively hot, restite-poor magmas at low (epizonal-subvolcanic) pressure,
$$a_{H_2 O} $$
, and
$$a_{O_2 } $$
. Mineral assemblages are indicative of a multiphase crystallization history; the conspicuous mantling of the perthite ovoids with plagioclase can be explained by changes in magma composition and/or, P, T, and
$$a_{H_2 O} $$
 affecting the stabilities of feldspars. The isotopic composition of rapakivi granites is generally compatible with a lower crustal protolith. The latter could have been either a melt-depleted residue or otherwise relatively anhydrous igneous or metaigneous rock. Melting of the protolith commenced under vapor-absent conditions and was induced by heat from the contemporaneous mantle-derived mafic magmas. The widespread rapakivi granite magmatism in the Middle Proterozoic may have been related to the establishment of a major continental mass (supercontinent).ZusammenfassungRapakivi-Granite sind A-Typ Granite mit Rapakivi Texturen, die zumindest in den grÃ¶ÃŸeren Batholiten zu erkennen sind.

Enhanced detection of solids from Gaussian spectral features,"We define a spectral feature approach to improve compositional exploitation for hyperspectral imaging. Focusing on the spectral feature characteristics of materials makes detection more robust to the spectral variability of both the target and background encountered during the collection process, consequently reducing detection false alarm rates without compromising sensitivity. Our method decomposes each spectrum into a small set of Gaussian-shaped components using LASSO regression (L1-regularization). A detection framework extracts the combinations of spectral features unique to a material of interest, allowing identification of target materials given its presence in intimate (i.e., nonlinear) mixtures and at different morphologies (e.g., particle sizes). We validate our methods with experimental data that incorporate variability from particle size, measurement angle, and atmospheric conditions. Initial exploitation results using our approach for fused silica demonstrate improved performance extendible across localized experimental conditions.",2017,2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
Is seed-contamination with GMOs a problem for food safety and the environment?,"Traceability and labelling requirements asforeseen in amended European regulationsfor GMOs (Ref. 1) and the problem of thecontamination of conventional seeds withGMOs have caused considerable tradeconcerns. Shocked by the need of a buy-back program for seed corn that containsthe potentially allergenic Cry9C protein,the US and international seed tradeassociations called for a global adoption of practical seed GMO thresholds(http://www.amseed.com/documents/index.html). In Europe also, the contaminationof canola seeds raised concerns, whenrealizing Canadian experiences with thefast induction of multiple herbicide-resistant weeds (http://www.biotech-info.net/Canadian_scare.html).Presently, the European Commissionand the OECD discuss traceability-systemsfor GMOs and tolerance levels forcontamination. Temporal and spatiallimitations for the use of GMOs in areasof seed production that are specific fordifferent plant species (according topollination characteristics and seedlongevity) shall be implemented.Furthermore, a revision of the novel foodregulation shall, in future, enable Europeanapprovals of GMOs. Asingle, centralizedrisk-assessment process covering bothenvironmental risks and risks to humanhealth shall be performed by the EuropeanFood Authority primarily, but will dealwith regional ecological specificities.But there is discussion concerning theextent and consequences of contaminationsby GMOs and if thresholds forcontamination and measures for seedproduction can really solve the problems.The complex methods and long distancesassociated with pollen and seed dispersalmight not allow future production ofuncontaminated seeds using conventionalstrategies for seed production.Up to 0.75% of maize pollen isdistributed >500 m away and the need for apotential movement of maize pollen by beesand long range transport under certainweather conditions to be acknowledged aresummarized in a report of the UK NationalPollen Research Unit (see report from theNational Pollen Research Unit â€˜Pollendispersal in the crops maize, oil seed rape,potatoes, sugar beet and wheat;http://www.soilassociation.org).

How Are Languages Learned,"As we go about our daily lives, most people donâ€™t often ponder the origin of our ability to communicate. One doesnâ€™t usually consider how without any special effort a child living anywhere on the planet if exposed to a language is able to learn that language to total fluency. An amazing feat seen by the scientific community â€œas one of the many utterly unexplainable mysteries that besets us in our daily livesâ€ (Galasso, n. d., para. 1) It would suggest that humans have an innate capacity to acquire a language. The focus of this paper is on the much-debated question as to whether this innate capacity continues when one acquires a second language (L2). One could easily assume that it is does not continue due to the overall success rate of second language learners. â€œVery few L2 learners appear to be fully successful in the way that native speakers areâ€ (Towell & Hawkins, 1994, p. 14). This paper will argue that second language is acquired on the same universal innate principles that govern first language (L1) acquisition, which is why one finds the same stages of development. It contends that even if the L2 learner is not successful, it is the result of various other intervening variables and not the absence of innate capacities. The first part of the paper will look critically at the main question in recent studies of L1 acquisition which involves finding out what in language is inborn, we say hard-wired, into the infantâ€™s brain structure and what is learned through experience. It will compare the three main perspectives of L1 acquisition. The second part of the paper will then discuss to what extent is L2 acquisition guided by the same language learning mechanism that L1 acquisition is. To approach this, the paper will consider some of the similarities and differences in child L1 acquisition and adult L2 acquisition. The paper examines two areas of contention: the critical period hypothesis and developmental stages in learner language. The last section will deal with the various intervening variables such as, learning conditions, motivation, and egocentrism, which could account for the difference in outcomes of L1 and L2 learners. Slobin (as cited in Fromkin et al, p. 341) states: â€œThe capacity to learn language is deeply ingrained in us as a species, just as the capacity to walk, to grasp objects, to recognize faces.â€ Exactly what is innate and what is the result of experience? Although this question hasnâ€™t been answered to anyoneâ€™s complete satisfaction, â€œit seems clear that",2009,

Application of the LASSO algorithm for fitting the multiexponential data of the NMR relaxometry,"The problem of time series fitting by the sum of several exponentials with different decay parameters often arises analyzing the data of a physical experiment. In particular, such a problem arises determining the nuclear transverse relaxation times from the spin-echo decay NMR data. Mathematically, the problem can be formulated as a solution of the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind with an exponential kernel, or an equivalent system of linear equations. To solve this equation, various regularization methods are used, based on the L2-norm in most cases. We report the application of the L1-regularization for the problem, using the LASSO algorithm. A comparison was made between the results of L1- and L2-regularization on model time series, which were the sum of several exponential decays with noise. Also the L1- and L2-regularization were applied to analyze the 1H NMR experimental data of the spin-echo decays of n-hexane adsorbed in the porous volume of aluminium poor MFI-type zeolites known as ZSM-5. It was found out that the L1-regularization is effective method for determination of the transverse relaxation times from NMR data.",2018,

"Human rights, cultural property and intellectual property: three concepts in search of a relationship","In the face of increasing globalisation, and a collision between global communication systems and local traditions, this book offers innovative trans-disciplinary analyses of the value of traditional cultural expressions (TCE) and suggests appropriate protection mechanisms for them. It combines approaches from history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology and law, and charts previously untravelled paths for developing new policy tools and legal designs that go beyond conventional copyright models. Its authors extend their reflections to a consideration of the specific features of the digital environment, which, despite enhancing the risks of misappropriation of traditional knowledge and creativity, may equally offer new opportunities for revitalising indigenous peoplesâ€™ values and provide for the sustainability of TCE. 
 
This book will appeal to scholars interested in multidisciplinary analyses of the fragmentation of international law in the field of intellectual property and traditional cultural expressions. It will also be valuable reading for those working on broader governance and human rights issues.

"Identifying drug-pathway association pairs based on L2,1-integrative penalized matrix decomposition","BackgroundTraditional drug identification methods follow the â€œone drug-one targetâ€ thought. But those methods ignore the natural characters of human diseases. To overcome this limitation, many identification methods of drug-pathway association pairs have been developed, such as the integrative penalized matrix decomposition (iPaD) method. The iPaD method imposes the L1-norm penalty on the regularization term. However, lasso-type penalties have an obvious disadvantage, that is, the sparsity produced by them is too dispersive.ResultsTherefore, to improve the performance of the iPaD method, we propose a novel method named L2,1-iPaD to identify paired drug-pathway associations. In the L2,1-iPaD model, we use the L2,1-norm penalty to replace the L1-norm penalty since the L2,1-norm penalty can produce row sparsity.ConclusionsBy applying the L2,1-iPaD method to the CCLE and NCI-60 datasets, we demonstrate that the performance of L2,1-iPaD method is superior to existing methods. And the proposed method can achieve better enrichment in terms of discovering validated drug-pathway association pairs than the iPaD method by performing permutation test. The results on the two real datasets prove that our method is effective.",2017,BMC Systems Biology
Discovery of Pseudofrenelopsis from the Lower Cretaceous of Liupanshan Basin and its paleoclimatic significance,"Abstract The Lower Cretaceous strata are well developed and widely distributed in the Liupanshan Basin, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, NW China. A variety of spores and pollen have been discovered, whereas few megafossil plants have been reported. In the present study, a new cheirolepidiaceous species, Pseudofrenelopsis liupanshanensis , is described from the Lower Cretaceous Naijiahe Formation of the Liupanshan Basin based on the leaf morphological and cuticular features. The specimens are characterized by cylindrical leafy shoots with spirally and loosely arranged triangular leaves. The cuticles are strongly cutinized with very developed papillae and the absence of hairs or trichomes on the epidermis of the leaves and internodes. The stomata are longitudinally arranged in uniseriate files and irregularly oriented and commonly surrounded by 5â€“6 subsidiary cells. The present species is morphologically and micromorphologically distinct from other Pseudofrenelopsis species. A seasonal and arid or semi-arid climate is represented in the Liupanshan Basin during the late Early Cretaceous, which is indicated by fossil plant taxa and the leafy shoot morphological and epidermal structures of the present Pseudofrenelopsis . Furthermore, the dominant Classopollis , occurrence of gypsum layers and evidence of the carbon and oxygen isotopes also support these findings.",2014,Cretaceous Research
Water mills in the area of Sagalassos: a disappearing ancient technology,"As water mills are quickly disappearing throughout Turkey, it is becoming very difficult to collect information about this type of ancient technology. By means of an ethno-archaeological study carried out in the territory of ancient Sagalassos (Pisidia), the very limited remains of 15 water mills were recorded. Following the recent introduction of electric mills, water mills have lost their previous importance and today some of the mill houses are used as stables or shelters. Interviews with local people provided some information about the capacity of the mills and about the kind of grain that was ground in them. All the mills under discussion belong to the â€˜ordinaryâ€™ horizontal-wheeled type of water mill. This type may have originated in or near Turkey during the Hellenistic period. A literary and archaeological study concerning the various types of mills showed that the type found near Sagalassos was best suited to local circumstances. Tax records confirm the presence of water mills in the area during early Ottoman times.",2002,Anatolian studies
Supervised Classification Using Sparse Fisher's LDA,"It is well known that in a supervised classification setting when the number of features is smaller than the number of observations, Fisher's linear discriminant rule is asymptotically Bayes. However, there are numerous modern applications where classification is needed in the high-dimensional setting. Naive implementation of Fisher's rule in this case fails to provide good results because the sample covariance matrix is singular. Moreover, by constructing a classifier that relies on all features the interpretation of the results is challenging. Our goal is to provide robust classification that relies only on a small subset of important features and accounts for the underlying correlation structure. We apply a lasso-type penalty to the discriminant vector to ensure sparsity of the solution and use a shrinkage type estimator for the covariance matrix. The resulting optimization problem is solved using an iterative coordinate ascent algorithm. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of nonconvexity on the sparsity level of the solution and highlight the difference between the penalized and the constrained versions of the problem. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs favorably in comparison to alternatives. The method is used to classify leukemia patients based on DNA methylation features.",2013,arXiv: Machine Learning

"Identification of significant genetic variants via SLOPE, and its extension to group SLOPE","The method of Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation, abbreviated as SLOPE, is a novel sparse regression method for model selection introduced in a sequence of recent papers, [4], [3] and [7] by Bogdan, van den Berg, Sabatti, Su and Candes. It estimates the coefficients of a linear model that possibly has more unknown parameters than observations. In many settings the SLOPE method is shown to successfully control the false discovery rate (the proportion of the irrelevant among all selected predictors) at a user specified level. In this paper we evaluate its performance on genetic data, and show its superiority over LASSO which is a related and popular method. Often in genetic data sets, group structures among the predictor variables are given as prior knowledge, such as SNPs in a gene or genes in a pathway. Following this motivation we extend SLOPE in the spirit of Group LASSO to Group SLOPE, a method that can handle group structures between the predictor variables, which are ubiquitous in real genetic data. Our simulation results show that the proposed Group SLOPE method is capable of controlling the false discovery rate at a specified level. Moreover, our simulations show that compared to Group LASSO, Group SLOPE in general achieves a higher power as well as a lower false discovery rate.",2015,

A Summary of Recent Experience in the Characterisation and Remediation of Peatlands,"This chapter on the characterization and remediation of peatlands in the United Kingdom is from the proceedings of an international conference on the terrain and geohazard challenges facing onshore oil and gas pipelines (June 2004, London, United Kingdom). The authors review the two main types of peatland bogs, blanket bog and raised bog, noting that they are of considerable ecological and archeological interest. They also form considerable areas of the U.K., so the characterization and remediation of peatland is of increasing importance where they are intersected by new developments such as pipeline routes or windfarms. The authors then describe two recent studies of peatland areas in the U.K., at Glasson and Drumburgh Mosses in Northern England and Moine Mhor in Western Scotland. These case studies illustrate some new techniques for managing peatlands that are suitable for use where new pipeline developments intersect peatland areas, often resulting in significant time and cost savings when collecting data for design purposes. The techniques include peat depth assessments, detailed land survey using global positioning system (GPS) leveling, hydrological surveys, hydrogeological and soils investigations, manipulation of data using a geographical information system (GIS), and groundwater modeling.",2005,
Pars plana suture fixation for intraocular lenses dislocated into the vitreous cavity using a closed-eye cow-hitch technique.,"We describe a modified intraocular cow-hitch technique for pars plana suture fixation of intraocular lenses (IOLs) that dislocated into the vitreous cavity in 3 patients who had a 3-port vitrectomy and IOL implantation because of retinal disease. To reposition the dislocated IOL after the residual vitreous was removed, 2 additional sclerotomies for suture fixation were made 3.0 mm posterior to the limbus. A loop (cow-hitch knot) was made with 10-0 polypropylene for suture fixation. After the neck of the cow-hitch loop was grasped with an intraocular forceps, the loop was used to lasso a haptic of the dislocated IOL, which was then pulled forward to the sclerotomy. The same procedure was used for the other haptic, and both sutures were secured to the sclera under scleral flaps. In all patients, the dislocated IOLs were repositioned without the need for extraction. The procedures were uneventful. Pars plana suture fixation with the intraocular cow-hitch technique can be used to reposition an IOL that has dislocated into the vitreous cavity.",2004,Journal of cataract and refractive surgery
"Spatial and temporal variations of the ectoparasites of seven reef fish species from Lizard Island and Heron Island, Australia","Spatial and temporal variations in abundance of ectoparasites from 7 coral reef"" fish species Illernigymnus melapterus (Labridae), Siganus doliatus (Siganidae), Scolopsis bilineatus (Nemipteridae), Thalassoma lunare (Labridae), Scants sordidus (Scaridae), Ctenochaetus striatus (Acanthuridae), and Acanthochromis polyacanthus (Pomacentridae)I at 2 locations, Lizard Island and Heron Island in the Great Barrier Reef, were investigated. The study demonstrates that there is a significant species-specific parasite fauna which is conserved over space and time. Host identity explained most of the variation in parasite composition and abundance while host size explained a smaller proportion of the variation. For each species the parasite assemblage showed little variation among local, but physically varied, sites. Species-specific patterns of parasite abundance were similar between widely separated locations, although there were more categories of parasites at the northern location, Lizard Island. Parasite numbers and species composition among fish species at Lizard Island did not vary among collection times except for S. doliatus, which had a 7-fold increase between May 1992 and January 1993, mainly due to dactylogyridean monogeneans. Parasite abundance was positively correlated with fish standard length for 3 fish species.",1994,Marine Ecology Progress Series

"Urban-Rural Integration at Ancient Sagalassos (SW Turkey). Archaeological, Archaeozoological and Geochemical Evidence","Abstract: Archaeological and archaeozoological data from the antique site of Sagalassos (southwest Turkey) are combined with data from geochemical analyses of trace elements in archaeological animal bones, to document the changing relation between city and countryside from the 1st to the 7th century AD. These data reveal that during the Early to Middle Imperial period ( c . 25BC â€“ 300 AD) the cityâ€™s subsistence requirements were largely met by the production capacity of its immediate vicinity, found to be a highly polluted area, and that the inhabitants of Sagalassos were relying little on the countryside. The integration of the city and the countryside was strengthened during the Late Roman period ( c . AD 300-450), when more rural products seemed to reach Sagalassos. Animal bones are at that time significantly lower in metal content and must have originated from animals that were kept in areas beyond the zone of heavy pollution. At the same time, occupation density in the countryside reached its climax. Then, in the Early Byzantine time ( c . AD 450-700), the inhabitants seemed to return to the situation of the Early to Middle Imperial period and were sustained by the exploitation of the land close to the city. Keywords: Turkey, Sagalassos, imperial and Byzantine periods, Animal bones, Heavy metal contents, Geochemical analysis, Urban-rural integration Resumen: Datos arqueozoologicos y arqueologicos del yacimiento de Sagalassos (Turquia sudoccidental) se combinan con otros procedentes de analisis geoquimicos de elementos traza en los huesos animales para documentar la relacion cambiante entre la urbe y el ambito rural desde el I al vII siglo AD. Estos datos evidencian que durante el periodo imperial temprano y medio 25 BC-300 AD los requisitos de aprovisionamiento de la ciudad se fundamentaban mayoritariamente en la capacidad productora de su entorno mas inmediato, una zona altamente contaminada, por lo que los habitantes de Sagalassos hacian poco uso del entorno rural. Durante el periodo Romano Tardio 300-400 AD se reforzo la integracion entre la ciudad y su entorno rural y es, en este momento, cuando mas productos rurales parecen haber alcanzado Sagalassos. En este ultimo periodo los restos animales presentan un contenido significativo inferior de metales por lo que deben haberse originado en cabanas que se mantenian alejadas de la zona de contaminacion intensa. Al mismo tiempo la densidad de ocupacion del campo alcanzo entonces su climax. En el periodo Bizantino Temprano (450-700 AD) los habitantes parecen haber retornado a la situacion documentada en el periodo Imperial Temprano y Medio siendo entonces mantenidos por la explotacion de las tierras mas proximas a la ciudad.

We introduce the used methodologies, and then assess the methods on simulated ""Systems Genetics"" (or genetical genomics) datasets.

Letter to the Editor,"The paper by Alfons, Croux and Gelper (2013), Sparse least trimmed squares regression for analyzing high-dimensional large data sets, considered a combination of least trimmed squares (LTS) and lasso penalty for robust and sparse high-dimensional regression. In a recent paper [She and Owen (2011)], a method for outlier detection based on a sparsity penalty on the mean shift parameter was proposed (designated by â€œSOâ€ in the following). This work is mentioned in Alfons et al. as being an â€œentirely different approach.â€ Certainly the problem studied by Alfons et al. is novel and interesting. However, there is actually a connection between the LTS approach and that of She and Owen (2011). This connection can be roughly seen from Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 4.1 of She and Owen (2011), where iterative thresholding was related to penalized regression and also to the M-estimator. In particular, although not explicitly mentioned in She and Owen (2011), from this one can derive the close relationship between hard thresholding, L0 penalty and LTS [the relationship between hard thresholding and L0 penalty was mentioned on page 630 of She and Owen (2011)]. Given that LTS regression is not directly posed as an M-estimator, the following proposition can be directly shown via elementary arguments.",2013,
Using ASICS to quantify metabolites in 1D H NMR spectra: an application to perinatal survival in pigs,"1D H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a high-throughput technology that allows to obtain metabolomic profile easily (e.g., from fluids such as blood) at low cost. However, unlike other types of data, it is difficult to detect which metabolites are present from the 1D H NMR spectrum of a complex mixture. In 1D H NMR spectrometry, each generated spectrum is usually first divided into intervals called buckets. Then, the areas under the curve are computed for each bucket. These steps are repeated for each spectrum and multivariate statistical analyses or tests are used to provide a list of buckets that are significantly different between the studied groups but requires that 1D H NMR experts identify the metabolites involved in the significant buckets for interpretation. Not only is this identification step tedious, time consuming and expert dependent but it also leads to a serious loss of information since the identification of metabolites is restricted to significant ones. Another way to proceed would be to identify and quantify all the metabolites in each spectrum and to perform statistical analyses on these data but this problem is still an open issue. In this communication, we present a new method, called ASICS (Automatic Statistical Identification in Complex Spectra), which allows the identification and the quantification of metabolites in a complex mixture obtained with 1D H NMR [1]. Based on a set of pure metabolite spectra, a linear model with a Lasso penalty is fitted. This model computes the proportions of each metabolites in the complex spectrum. Global or local chemical shift variations due to various experimental conditions or peak overlapping are also automatically handled by a specific warping strategy. To asses the performance of ASICS, we used data from PORCINET (ANR09-GENM-005). The projectâ€™s goal is to understand the mechanisms of maturity and perinatal survival in pigs. Blood samples were collected on fetuses at 90 and 110 days of gestation. With these samples, metabolic profiles were obtained by 1D H NMR as well as biochemical dosages of three metabolites",2017,
Pretreatment MR-Based Radiomics Signature as Potential Imaging Biomarker for Assessing the Expression of Topoisomerase II alpha (TOPO-IIÎ±) in Rectal Cancer.,"BACKGROUND
Rectal cancer (RC) is one of the most common cancers throughout the world. Chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy play an important role in the treatment of advanced RC. Whether to add topoisomerase inhibitor to individualized chemotherapy is a puzzling question for clinicians.


PURPOSE
To investigate whether pretreatment MR-based radiomics signature can assess the expression of topoisomerase II alpha (TOPO-IIÎ±) in RC.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective.


POPULATION
In all, 122 patients with RC. Field Strength/Sequence: Pretreatment 3.0T; T2 WI turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence.


ASSESSMENT
A training group (n = 85) and a test group (n = 37) with pathologically confirmed RC. Patients underwent TOPO-IIÎ± expression. A total of 180 radiomics features were extracted from oblique axial T2 WI TSE images of the entire primary tumor. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to reduce the dimension of the data and select the features.


STATISTICAL TESTS
The assessment models were established by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The performance of the model was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, nomogram, and calibration.


RESULTS
The radiomics signature, which consisted of 10 selected optimal features, was significantly associated with TOPO-IIÎ± expression (P < 0.01 for both training and test groups). The area under the curve (AUC), the sensitivity, and the specificity for assessing TOPO-IIÎ± expression, were 0.859, 0.872, and 0.739, respectively, in the training group, while they were 0.762, 0.941, and 0.600 in the test group. The nomogram model of the radiomics signature (Rad-score) had good calibration. Calibration curves were plotted to assess the calibration of the radiomics nomogram that was accompanied with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (P = 0.52).


DATA CONCLUSION
The proposed pretreatment MR-based radiomics signature was associated with TOPO-IIÎ± expression. A radiomics nomogram might be helpful in the individualized assessment of TOPO-IIÎ± expression in patients with RC.

A History of Modern Oman,"A HISTORY OF MODERN OMAN Jeremy Jones and Nicholas Ridout Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015 (301 pages + maps, index) $94.99 (cloth)Jeremy Jones and Nicholas Ridout's book on modern Oman will be a reference for the history of Oman from the late eighteenth century to the present day. There are already a few histories of Oman, such as Patricia Risso's Oman and Muscat (Croom Helm, 1986) or Uzi Rabi's Emergence of States in a Tribal Society (Sussex University Press, 2006). Marc Valeri's book, Oman: Politics and Society in the Qaboos State (Oxford University Press, 2014) covers nation building and political legitimacy in the sultanate since 1970. A History of Modern Oman, however, writes a global history of the sultanate, placing its expansion as a thalassocracy and its emergence as a nation-state within a larger frame of the sultans' encounters and entanglements with colonial powers.The book's main argument is that unlike its neighbors the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, Oman has been able to undertake major changes to become part of the globalized world while keeping some of its nineteenth-century traditions. The sultans have supposedly invented an original mode of development that preserves Oman's political, social, and religious traditions. Hence Oman exemplifies the model of a state enjoying oil-reserve prosperity while preserving Ibadism, one of Islam's main branches, said to have been founded as early as the seventh century CE, and a centuryold cosmopolitan society. It is a classic argument, tackled here in two parts, covering first the long nineteenth century and then the twentieth century. The argument, however, is questionable. Oman's neighbors, like the emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, have followed a similar political and social pattern as the one Jones and Ridout describe (see, for example, Christopher Davidson's Abu Dhabi: Oil and Beyond [Columbia University Press, 2009]). Nevertheless, the authors provide valuable details about Oman's political, social, and cultural modernity since the nineteenth century. Chapter two, for example, describes the development of a press and a dynamic intellectual sphere in Zanzibar and Oman, situating it within the larger frame of the global nahda movement. Chapters six and seven stand as a good resume of the modernizing reforms and measures Sultan Qaboos carried out in the 1970s, facilitated by the wealth coming from oil revenues and the help of British advisers, who served at economic consultants. The authors give a well-documented portrait of Omani society in the twentieth century as they tackle the social consequences of the oil boom as well as labor migration.The book's second central argument is that ""key Sultans"" made Oman a modern and federated nation-state that became an influential partner to the regional powers. The relevance of the ""nation-state"" in the context of Oman is questionable, and the book does not analyze the evidence of a ""national sentiment."" The concept is arguably Eurocentric and does not do justice to Oman's long political tradition, deeply influenced by Ibadism. These qualifications do not, however, detract from the book's powerful narration of how the sultans from the late eighteenth century onward created a federated state in Oman, despite internal tensions and tribal conflicts. For Jones and Ridout, Sa'id bin Sultan (r. 1806-56), Sa'id III bin Taymur (r. 1932-70), and Sultan Qaboos, who is currently in power, led what could be called a policy of national union and reconciliation. The book also demonstrates how Sultan Qaboos, in the context of the oil boom, transformed the figure of the sultan: in addition to being the ultimate source of authority he also became a provider of services and the guardian of the unified nation-state.A History of Oman takes the shura as a key concept through which to understand Oman's political system. The shura, as the authors define it, is ""the practice whereby the ruler, leader or sheikh consults with others before taking decisions of importance to the society, tribe or family which he leads"" (198). â€¦",2016,Arab Studies Journal
Cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is associated with the patient global assessment but not with objective measurements of disease activity,"Objective
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suffer from more cardiovascular disease (CVD), and develop cardiovascular risk factors at an earlier age than the general population. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an important predictor of cardiovascular health. There are few data regarding CRF of RA patients, measured as peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) by the gold standard method; cardiopulmonary exercise testing. We compared CRF in RA patients to those from a healthy population, and investigated if risk factors for CVD and RA-specific variables including subjective and objective disease activity measures were associated with CRF in RA patients.


Methods
VO2peak tests of RA patients (n=93) were compared to those of an age-matched and gender-matched healthy population (n=4631) from the Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag Health Study. Predictors of VO2peak were found using Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression, followed by standardised multiple linear regression.


Results
Women with RA â‰¥40 years and men with RA aged 40-49 years or 60-69 years had up to 20% lower CRF than the healthy population in the same age groups. By relative importance, body mass index (standardised coefficient=-0.25, p<0.001), physical activity level (coefficient=0.21, p<0.001), patient global assessment (PGA; coefficient=-0.14, p=0.006), systolic blood pressure (coefficient=-0.12, p=0.016), resting heart rate (coefficient=-0.11, p=0.032) and smoking (coefficient=-0.10, p=0.046) were significant predictors of CRF (R2=0.82, gender-adjusted and age-adjusted).


Conclusion
CRF in RA patients was lower than in a healthy population. CRF was associated with common risk factors for CVD and the PGA score. Focusing on fitness in RA patients may improve cardiovascular health.",2019,RMD Open

These tunes preserve the old Szekely folk hymn tradition of Csik, Transylvania in the â€œcustomaryâ€ notation of the 18th century. Beside the songs from Kajoniâ€™s Cantionale, the Manuscript contains other items â€“ masses, Kyries for litany, baroque cantiones and new folk hymn texts â€“ to be used by cantors. 
Although today the Manuscript is incomplete, the entire source could be reconstructed with the help of earlier copies. It is high time for this important, somewhat enigmatic notated source of an adventurous past to be published in full. This will hopefully inspire future researchers to find conclusive answers to the questions who wrote it (the names are not of the scribes), when it was written (the usual date of 1774 is merely terminus ante quem), and whether it is a peerless source as to genre and notation or there are similar sources to be found.",2013,
"Tropicibacter naphthalenivorans gen. nov., sp. nov., a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium isolated from Semarang Port in Indonesia.","An aerobic, Gram-negative, motile bacterium, strain C02(T), was isolated from seawater obtained from Semarang Port in Indonesia. Cells of strain C02(T) were peritrichously flagellated and rod-shaped. Strain C02(T) was able to degrade naphthalene, alkylnaphthalenes and phenanthrene. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that this strain was affiliated with the family Rhodobacteraceae in the class Alphaproteobacteria and was related most closely to Marinovum algicola FF3(T) (95.7 % similarity) and Thalassobius aestuarii JC2049(T) (95.2 %). The DNA G+C content of strain C02(T) was 64.6 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids were C(18 : 1)omega7c (50.9 % of the total), C(16 : 0) (17.9 %), 11 methyl C(18 : 1)omega7c (14.7 %), C(18 : 1)omega9c (2.9 %) and C(19 : 0) cyclo omega8c (2.4 %), and the predominant respiratory lipoquinone was ubiquinone-10. Based on physiological, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain C02(T) is suggested to represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Tropicibacter naphthalenivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Tropicibacter naphthalenivorans is C02(T) (=JCM 14838(T)=DSM 19561(T)).",2009,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
A Novel Methodology using CT Imaging Biomarkers to Quantify Radiation Sensitivity in the Esophagus with Application to Clinical Trials,"Personalized cancer therapy seeks to tailor treatment to an individual patientâ€™s biology. Therefore, a means to characterize radiosensitivity is necessary. In this study, we investigated radiosensitivity in the normal esophagus using an imaging biomarker of radiation-response and esophageal toxicity, esophageal expansion, as a method to quantify radiosensitivity in 134 non-small-cell lung cancer patients, by using K-Means clustering to group patients based on esophageal radiosensitivity. Patients within the cluster of higher response and lower dose were labelled as radiosensitive. This information was used as a variable in toxicity prediction modelling (lasso logistic regression). The resultant model performance was quantified and compared to toxicity prediction modelling without utilizing radiosensitivity information. The esophageal expansion-response was highly variable between patients, even for similar radiation doses. K-Means clustering was able to identify three patient subgroups of radiosensitivity: radiosensitive, radio-normal, and radioresistant groups. Inclusion of the radiosensitive variable improved lasso logistic regression models compared to model performance without radiosensitivity information. Esophageal radiosensitivity can be quantified using esophageal expansion and K-Means clustering to improve toxicity prediction modelling. Finally, this methodology may be applied in clinical trials to validate pre-treatment biomarkers of esophageal toxicity.",2017,Scientific Reports
An Entropy-Based Machine Learning Algorithm for Combining Macroeconomic Forecasts,"This paper applies a Machine Learning approach with the aim of providing a single aggregated prediction from a set of individual predictions. Departing from the well-known maximum-entropy inference methodology, a new factor capturing the distance between the true and the estimated aggregated predictions presents a new problem. Algorithms such as ridge, lasso or elastic net help in finding a new methodology to tackle this issue. We carry out a simulation study to evaluate the performance of such a procedure and apply it in order to forecast and measure predictive ability using a dataset of predictions on Spanish gross domestic product.",2019,Entropy
Building Block Approaches to the Synthesis of Lasso Peptides and Polycyclic Saturated N-Heterocycles,"The first part of this dissertation describes the synthesis of peptide-based [1]rotaxanes (lasso peptides). Lasso peptides are bacterially produced natural products with unique interlocked structure that endows them exceptional proteolytic stability. Therefore, lasso peptides have been employed as scaffolds to enhance the proteolytic stability of linear peptides. This approach â€“ so-called molecular graftingâ€“ has been achieved by biosynthetic methods; however, there had been no example accomplished by the chemical synthesis. To achieve the synthesis of peptide-based [1]rotaxanes, we took a two-stage approach: the first is formation of [2]rotaxanes whose components are prefunctionalized with hydroxylamine and thioester for the subsequent steps; the second is two consecutive amide-forming ligation reactions, namely Î±-ketoacid-hydroxylamine ligation (KAHA ligation) and native chemical ligation (NCL) to attach linear peptide epitopes to the [2]rotaxane scaffold, ultimately providing peptide-based [1]rotaxanes. In this way, the incorporation of linear peptide epitopes with different lengths and amino acid residues onto a common rotaxane scaffold was achieved. The threaded structure in the synthesized molecules was confirmed by NMR, HPLC, and analysis of partial enzymatic degradation products. The synthetic lasso peptide mimetics were thermally stable and importantly, linear peptide epitopes gained significant proteolytic stability upon grafting onto the [1]rotaxane scaffold, as demonstrated by proteolytic stability assays using three different types of proteases. The stability of peptidebased [1]rotaxanes were comparable to the head-to-tail cyclic peptide bearing the same sequence.

Establishment of validated models for non-invasive prediction of rectal temperature of sows using infrared thermography and chemometrics,"Rectal temperature is an important physiological indicator used to characterize the reproductive and health status of sows. Infrared thermography, a surface temperature measurement technology, was investigated in this study to explore its feasibility in non-invasive detection of rectal temperature in sows. A total of 124 records of rectal temperature and surface temperature in various body regions of 99 Landrace Ã— Yorkshire crossbred sows were collected. These surface temperatures together with ambient temperature, ambient humidity, and wind speed in pig pens were correlated with the real rectal temperature of sows to establish rectal temperature prediction models by introducing chemometrics algorithms. Two types of models, i.e., full feature models and selected feature models, were established by applying the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method. The optimal model was attained when 7 important features were selected by LARS-Lasso, where correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors of calibration were 0.80 and 0.30 Â°C, respectively. Particularly, the validity and stability of established simplified models were further evaluated by applying the model to an independent prediction set, where correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors for prediction were 0.80 and 0.35 Â°C, respectively. The validation of established models is scarce in previous similar studies. Above all, this study demonstrated that introduction of chemometrics methodologies would lead to more reliable and accurate model for predicting sow rectal temperature, thus the potential for ensuring animal welfare in a broader view if extended to more applications.",2019,International Journal of Biometeorology
Inference in partially identified models with many moment inequalities using Lasso,"This paper considers inference in a partially identified moment (in)equality model with many moment inequalities. We propose a novel two-step inference procedure that combines the methods proposed by Chernozhukov, Chetverikov and Kato (2014c) (CCK14, hereafter) with a first-step moment inequality selection based on the Lasso. Our method controls size uniformly, both in underlying parameter and data distribution. Also, the power of our method compares favorably with that of the corresponding two-step method in CCK14 for large parts of the parameter space, both in theory and in simulations. Finally, our Lasso-based first step is straightforward to implement.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Robust parametric classification and variable selection by a minimum distance criterion,"We investigate a robust penalized logistic regression algorithm based on a minimum distance criterion. Influential outliers are often associated with the explosion of parameter vector estimates, but in the context of standard logistic regression, the bias due to outliers always causes the parameter vector to implode, that is, shrink toward the zero vector. Thus, using LASSO-like penalties to perform variable selection in the presence of outliers can result in missed detections of relevant covariates. We show that by choosing a minimum distance criterion together with an elastic net penalty, we can simultaneously find a parsimonious model and avoid estimation implosion even in the presence of many outliers in the important small n large p situation. Minimizing the penalized minimum distance criterion is a challenging problem due to its nonconvexity. To meet the challenge, we develop a simple and efficient MM (majorizationâ€“minimization) algorithm that can be adapted gracefully to the small n large p context...",2014,Quality Engineering
Sparse Bayes estimation in non-Gaussian models via data augmentation,"In this paper we provide a data-augmentation scheme that unifies many common sparse Bayes estimators into a single class. This leads to simple iterative algorithms for estimating the posterior mode under arbitrary combinations of likelihoods and priors within the class. The class itself is quite large: for example, it includes quantile regression, support vector machines, and logistic and multinomial logistic regression, along with the usual ridge regression, lasso, bridge/â€˜ a estimators, and regression with heavy-tailed errors. To arrive at this unified framework, we represent a wide class of objective functions as varianceâ€mean mixtures of Gaussians involving both the likelihood and penalty functions. This generalizes existing theory based solely on variance mixtures for the penalty function, and allows the theory of conditionally normal linear models to be brought to bear on a much wider class of models. We focus on two possible choices of the mixing measures: the generalized inverse-Gaussian and Polya distributions, leading to the hyperbolic and Z distributions, respectively. We exploit this conditional normality to find sparse, regularized estimates using tilted iteratively re-weighted least squares (TIRLS). Finally, we characterize the conditional moments of the latent variances for any model in our proposed class, and show the relationship between our method and two recent algorithms: LQA (local quadratic approximation) and LLA (local linear approximation).",2011,
[Cartography of sexually transmitted diseases in Burkina Faso: Ouagadougou Bobo-Dioulasso Banfora],During December 1994 in Burkina Faso five medical students visited health facilities in Ouagadougou along the axis route of Bobo-Dioulasso and in Banfora to determine the actual diagnostic and treatment capacity of the public and private facilities to control sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Overall there were truly insufficient and limited numbers of health workers especially laboratory technicians. Usually there were only 1-2 laboratory technicians per laboratory. Generally there was someone who was responsible for STD patients. Most health workers treat STDs based on knowledge obtained at nursing school or from pharmaceutical sales representatives. 8% of patients came to the health facilities for an STD. They were more likely to go to private health facilities than public facilities. They often went to a health facility after have already directly bought a drug from a vendor at the market. Most private health facilities avoided giving real information on the volume of their STD clientele in order not to be severely taxed. Few health facilities had an operating budget. Medicines generally were not available at the health facilities. Providers wrote prescriptions for patients which does not facilitate case management of STD patients. Most health workers knew the correct definition of STDs. They tended to provide correct treatment in most STD cases of urethral discharge but poor treatment for genital ulcers (i.e inadequate antibiotics) and very poor treatment of vaginal discharge. The concept of vaginal odor as an STD symptom was new for health workers. STDs receiving the best treatment were gonorrhea syphilis and trichomonas while chancroid received poor treatment. Many health workers were not familiar with Chlamydia infection Gardnerella vaginalis and G. mobiluncus. Nurses who tried to treat partners were quickly discouraged by the STD patient who came seeking treatment. Insufficient microscopes inadequate technicians and bad distribution of laboratories were obstacles the correct diagnosis of STDs.,1995,
Directing Power towards Sub-regions of the Alternative Hypothesis,"In this paper, I propose a novel test statistic for testing hypotheses about a potentially high-dimensional parameter vector. To obtain the statistic, I generalize the Mahalanobis distance to measure length in a direction of interest. The test statistic is the sample analogue of the distance and directs power towards a sub-region of the alternative hypothesis (henceforth sub-alternative). Its existence depends on a restricted eigenvalue condition that is tied directly to the scope of the sub-alternative. I show that if the conventional sample covariance matrix is used, then the computation of the test statistic reduces to linear regression with a constant dependent variable, restricted by the same constraints that specify the sub-alternative. To demonstrate the test statistic, I consider the case of testing against a sparse sub-alternative, which is defined by the number of element-wise violations of a null hypothesis. In this case the computation reduces to `0-regularized regression (best subset selection). In addition, I show that `1-regularized regression (Lasso) corresponds to near-sparse sub-alternatives.",2019,
Multiplicative Updates for the Lasso,"Multiplicative updates have proven useful for non-negativity constrained optimization. Presently, we demonstrate how multiplicative updates also can be used for unconstrained optimization. This is for instance useful when estimating the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) i.e. least squares minimization with L1-norm regularization, since the multiplicative updates (MU) can efficiently exploit the structure of the problem traditionally solved using quadratic programming (QP). We derive two algorithms based on MU for the LASSO and compare the performance to Matlabs standard QP solver as well as the basis pursuit denoising algorithm (BP) which can be obtained from www.sparselab.stanford.edu. The algorithms were tested on three benchmark bio-informatic datasets: A small scale data set where the number of observations is larger than the number of variables estimated (M < J) and two large scale microarray data sets (M Gt J). For small scale data the two MU algorithms, QP and BP give identical results while the time used is more or less of the same order. However, for large scale problems QP is unstable and slow. Both algorithms based on MU on the other hand are stable and faster but not as efficient as the BP algorithm and converge slowly for small regularizations. The benefit of the present MU algorithms is that they are easy to implement, they bridge multiplicative updates to unconstrained optimization and the updates derived monotonically decrease the cost-function thus does not need any objective function evaluation. Finally, both MU are potentially useful for a wide range of other models such as the elastic net or the fused LASSO. The Matlab implementations of the LASSO based on MU can be downloaded.",2007,2007 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing

Vaccine design via nonnegative lasso-based variable selection.,"There are many different strains of malaria parasites, each represented by a unique sequence of amino acids. A desirable vaccine would match the amino acid sequence of the parasite antigen. Because of the three-dimensional structure of protein, not all sites in the amino acid sequence participate in the binding between the vaccine-induced antibody and the parasite antigen. Nor do all sites have equal importance. In this work, we apply a nonnegative lasso-based variable selection to identify the 'important' amino acid sites and evaluate their relative importance. We then define a metric, the functional coverage, to measure the 'effective' matching in the amino acid sequence between the vaccine and the parasite. With the variable selection procedure, development of a vaccine needs only to target the important sites, and the potential effectiveness of a vaccine candidate is reflected by the functional coverage.

The Design Behind an Analysis Framework,"The development of software used to process petabytes of data per year is an elaborate project. The complexity of the detector means components of very diverse nature are required to process the data and one needs well dened frameworks that are both exible and maintainable. Modern programming architecture based on object-oriented component design supports desirable features of such frameworks. The principle has been applied in almost all sub-systems of Atlassoftware and its robustness has beneted the collaboration. An implementation of such framework for physics analysis, however, did not exist before the work presented in this paper. As it turns out the realisation of object-oriented analysis framework is closely related to the design of the event data object. In this paper, we well review the design behind the analysis framework developed around a data class called \EventView"". It is a highly integrated part of the Atlassoftware framework and is now becoming a standard platform for physics analysis in the collaboration.",2007,
Dynamics of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the continuum limit in quantum electrodynamics,"SummaryThe phase diagram in the coupling constant in QED and its connection with the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking are discussed. The mechanism of such a breaking connected with the collapse phenomenon is considered and a simple physical interpretation of the recent results of the computer simulations in lattice QED is given.

Accelerated Coordinate Descent with Adaptive Coordinate Frequencies,"Coordinate descent (CD) algorithms have become the method of choice for solving a number of machine learning tasks. They are particularly popular for training linear models, includ- ing linear support vector machine classication, LASSO regression, and logistic regression. We propose an extension of the CD algorithm, called the adaptive coordinate frequencies (ACF) method. This modied CD scheme does not treat all coordinates equally, in that it does not pick all coordinates equally often for optimization. Instead the relative frequen- cies of coordinates are subject to online adaptation. The resulting optimization scheme can result in signicant speed-ups.

"The Political Organization of Traditional Gold Mining: the Western Loby, c . 1850 to c . 1910","Gold production in the Loby region to the west of the Black Volta in the precolonial period was exclusively in the hands of lineages grouped in largely autonomous little towns, 118 in the area under study, of which Jebugu was the largest. The various peoples were a mixture of Voltaic language speakers, who formed the majority, with Mande speakers linked to the wider Mande world. Government was not centralized, but operated at three levels of lineage organization. At the first, Level I, sukula or units of residence for each self-governing kin group joined together as the wards of each town, under a resident chief. At Level II, each kin group in each sukula came under the authority of the head of its lineage, who lived in one of the larger, â€˜chieflyâ€™ towns perhaps several days' journey away. At Level III, this lineage organization for the Mande speakers was linked to the Mande-Jula capitals outside the Loby region, at Kong, Bonduku, Bobojulasso and Buna. So far as gold was concerned, this three-layered political system was a commercial organization which brought producers and distributors together in response to market demands. Voltaic-speaking producers at Level I were linked through the lineages to Voltaic and Mande-speaking distributors at Level II; while both producers and distributors on these levels were collectively linked to the Mande-speaking distributors on Level III, who connected the region with the outside world. The control of distributors over producers was indirect, and exercised solely through the market. This picture from the nineteenth century of fiercely independent gold miners, with traditional skills, beliefs and rights, operating only in the absence of central government, confirms accounts of gold production in the western Sudan dating from the Middle Ages, and offers a valuable case for study. The picture is supplemented and enhanced by what happened after the arrival of the French in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and the changes they introduced in the political organization of the Loby region in 1898. The evidence shows that, until the end of World War I, Loby gold production remained largely in the hands of traditional miners, who retained their links with the old commercial-political lineage system, which continued to market the bulk of the Loby gold. The influence of the colonial state, which for all practical purposes must have been perceived as none other than a fourth political level imposed above the existing three, was itself indirect, and of a familiar kind. In response to an increased demand for gold on the coast, Loby producers raised both their output and their sales, demonstrating the effectiveness of their traditional organization.",1988,The Journal of African History

[Communicating with vulnerable women for positive behaviour change: the Yerelon project in Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso)].,"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES
Since 1998, researchers in Burkina Faso have enrolled about 760 vulnerable women (sex workers, bar waitresses, pedlars, students, etc.) in an open cohort (the Yerelon cohort) to determine whether adequate management of sexually transmissible infection and exposure to well-designed, well-delivered, and plentiful communication for behaviour change (CBC) can reduce their vulnerability to HIV. This qualitative social anthropology study was conducted to: i) analyse the messages assimilated by the women who follow CBC sessions; ii) determine the impact of these messages on the women's behaviour.


METHODS
The researchers observed CBC sessions in the clinic, in women's homes and at their places of work for 45 days. They also conducted 37 individual in-depth interviews, 8 group interviews and a focus group, selecting a ""reasoned"" sample of 80 women from the cohort. The data were entered with Word software and analyzed with the 'Atlas TI' qualitative data analysis software.


RESULTS
This study shows that: i) these vulnerable women have good knowledge of the themes raised during CBC sessions with the Yerelon peer-leaders and are quite able to reproduce the messages. Most can repeat and explain them; ii) the women find the messages presented during CBC, by peers who live similar lives and speak their ""language"", to be understandable and applicable to them; iii) they learned much about condom use and negotiation, HIV/AIDS, genital herpes, and other STIs. They know for example that condoms have two sides, one lubricated and the other not, and that condoms effectively protect against pregnancy and some STIs; iv) they negotiate condom use better with all types of sexual partners, thus improving their relation to it; v) a large majority report new positive behaviour, selecting clients and partners, and using condoms routinely, taking it off after intercourse themselves. They also now routinely use modern medical care for any STIs; vi) Of 524 women seronegative at inclusion in 2003, only 0.8% became infected in the first three months of the study, and no others in the year that followed.


CONCLUSION
In Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, the communication offered in the CBC programme to vulnerable women by peer-advisers trained by a multidisciplinary team, improved to varying degrees the women's knowledge of the various topics covered. This improvement changed their behaviour positively, leading to routine condom use, especially with occasional partners. This has resulted in low HIV incidence. This model can and must be spread to other vulnerable populations. Admittedly, the free services and products provided in the programme make it harder to perpetuate and disseminate. The promotion of health mutuals is one method to provide funding.",2007,Sante
Improved estimation of dynamic connectivity from resting-state fMRI data,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used for neuronal connectivity analysis. As a datadriven technique, independent component analysis (ICA) has become a valuable tool for fMRI studies. Recently, due to the dynamic nature of the human brain, time-varying connectivity analysis is regarded as an important measure to reveal essential information within the network. The sliding window approach has been commonly used to extract dynamic information from fMRI time series. However, it has some limitations due to the assumption that connectivity at a given time can be estimated from all the samples of the input time series data spanned by the selected window. To address this issue, we apply a time-varying graphical lasso model (TVGL) proposed by Hallac et al., which can infer the network even when the observation interval is at only one time point. On the other hand, recent results have shown that the individualâ€™s connectivity profiles can be used as â€œfingerprintâ€ to identify subjects from a large group. We hypothesize that the subject-specific FC profiles may have the critical effect on analyzing FC dynamics at a group level. In this work, we apply a group ICA (GICA) based data-driven framework to assess dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC), based on the combination of GICA and TVGL. Also, we use the regression model to remove the subject-specific individuality in detecting functional dynamics. The results prove our hypothesis and suggest that removing the individual effect may benefit us to assess the connectivity dynamics within the human brain.",2019,
Sparse estimation of polynomial dynamical models,"In many practical situations, it is highly desirable to estimate an accurate mathematical model of a real system using as few parameters as possible. This can be motivated either from appealing to a parsimony principle (Occam's razor) or from the view point of the utilization complexity in terms of control synthesis, prediction, etc. At the same time, the need for an accurate description of the system behavior without knowing its complete dynamical structure often leads to model parameterizations describing a rich set of possible hypotheses; an unavoidable choice, which suggests sparsity of the desired parameter estimate. An elegant way to impose this expectation of sparsity is to estimate the parameters by penalizing the criterion with the l0 norm of the parameters, which is often implemented as solving an optimization program based on a convex relaxation (e.g. l1/LASSO, nuclear norm, ...). However, in order to apply these methods, the (unpenalized) cost function must be convex. This imposes a severe constraint on the types of model structures or estimation methods on which these relaxations can be applied. In this paper, we extend the use of convex relaxation techniques for sparsity to general rational plant model structures estimated by using prediction error minimization. This is done by combining the LASSO and the Steiglitz-McBride approaches. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed solution an extensive simulation study is provided.",2012,
Measures for the degree of overlap of gene signatures and applications to TCGA,"For cancer and many other complex diseases, a large number of gene signatures have been generated. In this study, we use cancer as an example and note that other diseases can be analyzed in a similar manner. For signatures generated in multiple independent studies on the same cancer type and outcome, and for signatures on different cancer types, it is of interest to evaluate their degree of overlap. Many of the existing studies simply count the number (or percentage) of overlapped genes shared by two signatures. Such an approach has serious limitations. In this study, as a demonstrating example, we consider cancer prognosis data under the Cox model. Lasso, which is representative of a large number of regularization methods, is adopted for generating gene signatures. We examine two families of measures for quantifying the degree of overlap. The first family is based on the Cox-Lasso estimates at the optimal tunings, and the second family is based on estimates across the whole solution paths. Within each family, multiple measures, which describe the overlap from different perspectives, are introduced. The analysis of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data on five cancer types shows that the degree of overlap varies across measures, cancer types and types of (epi)genetic measurements. More investigations are needed to better describe and understand the overlaps among gene signatures.",2015,Briefings in bioinformatics
Factores De Riesgo Asociados a Complicaciones Del SÃ­ndrome NefrÃ³tico En PediatrÃ­a,"The association between risk factors and complications of nephrotic syndrome in children aged 2-5 years was determined by analyzing the records of medical records of 93 pediatric patients, developed in the nephrology department of a pediatric hospital in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador during the period from 2013 to 2017. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study using the SPSS 21 program. The white population (67%) being male (66%) in urban areas (84%) in the province of Guayas (88 %) the most affected. Of the total patients who presented complications in the study (n = 25), 84% (n = 21) resulted in some type of risk factor, with a statistically significant association of (p = 0.000). Infections occurred in 100% of cases, followed by pleural effusion with 52%. There is a statisticalassociation between complications and sedentary lifestyle with a significance of (p = 0.000) and 95% CI equal to food transgression. The presence of associated risk factors increases the risk nine times (OR: 6,484) to develop some kind of complication. Pediatric nephrotic syndrome is a disease that is frequently associated with morbidity and mortality due to the complications it may present.
