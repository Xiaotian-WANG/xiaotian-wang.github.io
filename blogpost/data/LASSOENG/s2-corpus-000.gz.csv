Comparison of statistical methods for finding network motifs,"Abstract There has been much recent interest in systems biology for investigating the structure of gene regulatory systems. Such networks are often formed of specific patterns, or network motifs, that are interesting from a biological point of view. Our aim in the present paper is to compare statistical methods specifically with regard to the question of how well they can detect such motifs. One popular approach is by network analysis with Gaussian graphical models (GGMs), which are statistical models associated with undirected graphs, where vertices of the graph represent genes and edges indicate regulatory interactions. Gene expression microarray data allow us to observe the amount of mRNA simultaneously for a large number of genes p under different experimental conditions n, where p is usually much larger than n prohibiting the use of standard methods. We therefore compare the performance of a number of procedures that have been specifically designed to address this large p-small n issue: G-Lasso estimation, Neighbourhood selection, Shrinkage estimation using empirical Bayes for model selection, and PC-algorithm. We found that all approaches performed poorly on the benchmark E. coli network. Hence we systematically studied their ability to detect specific network motifs, pairs, hubs and cascades, in extensive simulations. We conclude that all methods have difficulty detecting hubs, but the PC-algorithm is most promising.",2014,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
Parametric component detection and variable selection in varying-coefficient partially linear models,"In this paper we are concerned with detecting the true structure of a varying-coefficient partially linear model. The first issue is to identify whether a coefficient is parametric. The second issue is to select significant covariates in both nonparametric and parametric portions. In order to simultaneously address both issues, we propose to combine local linear smoothing and the adaptive LASSO and penalize both the coefficient functions and their derivatives using an adaptive L""1 penalty. We give conditions under which this new adaptive LASSO consistently identifies the significant variables and parametric components along with estimation sparsity. Simulated and real data analysis demonstrate the proposed methodology.",2012,J. Multivar. Anal.
The comparative morphology of hepatic photophores in decapod Crustacea,"The hepatic photophores of species of Sergestes (organs of Pesta) contain fluorescent paracrystalline platelets which are the sources of the luminescence. The cells containing these crystals are contiguous with cells filled with lipid droplets which act as a diffuse reflector. The optical properties of the organ as a whole derive from the different arrangement of the various regions in the mosaic of individual tubules. The hepatic photophores of Parapandalus, Thalassocaris and Chlorotocoides have a similar anatomical position but differ considerably in structure. They do not contain paracrystalline material and they have a diffuse reflector, probably not composed of lipid, which is separated from the tubules that make up the photocytes. The organs in Thalassocaris and Chlorotocoides are very similar in structure. Luminescence in the photophores of all four genera is probably intracellular.",1981,Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom
Predicting later asthma in toddlers: Do environmental exposure data improve a clinical tool?,"Background: We recently developed a simple clinical tool for predicting asthma at school-age in toddlers presenting at the doctor with wheeze or cough (ERJ 2011;38(Supp 55):269-270s). It uses 10 predictors (severity of wheeze, atopic family history, eczema, age and sex), summarized in a score. We now assessed, whether environmental (EV) and socioeconomic (SE) factors improve the predictive performance of this tool.

Methods: From a population-based cohort (UK), we included 1-3 year-olds with current wheeze or recurrent cough and related healthcare visits. Current asthma (wheeze needing inhalers) was assessed 5 yrs later. As potential predictors we included the original prediction score, plus EV (nursery care, siblings, cooking and heating fuel, pets, smoking, breastfeeding) and SE factors (Townsend score, overcrowding, traffic density, urban living, parental education, single parents). We first looked at univariable associations between EV and SE factors and asthma 5 yrs later and then used lasso penalized logistic regression to select predictors in a model including all potential predictors.

Results: 345/1226 (28%) eligible children had asthma 5 yrs after baseline. Cooking with gas and maternal smoking were associated with asthma (p<0.05). However, in the lasso penalized logistic regression only the original score was selected.

Conclusion: Severity of wheeze and family history remain the most important predictors of later asthma in toddlers. Information on EV and SE factors adds little to improve predictive performance of the tool. Further research should investigate the additional value of physiological measurements.

Factors related to and economic implications of inhospital death in German lung cancer patients - results of a Nationwide health insurance claims data based study,"BackgroundWhen patients die in a hospital their quality of life is lower than when they die at home or in a hospice. Despite efforts to improve palliative care supply structures, still about 60% of lung cancer patients die in a hospital. Studies have examined factors related to inhospital death in lung cancer patients, yet none used data of a representative German population, additionally including economic aspects. This study aimed to identify factors related to inhospital death in German lung cancer patients and analysed resulting costs.MethodsWe analysed a dataset of health insurance claims of 17,478 lung cancer patients (incident 2009) with 3 year individual follow-up. We grouped patients into inhospital death and death elsewhere. Studied factors were indicators of healthcare utilization, palliative care, comorbidities and disease spread. We used logistic regression models with LASSO selection method to identify relevant factors. We compared all-cause healthcare expenditures for the last 30Â days of life between both groups using generalized linear models with gamma distribution.ResultsTwelve thousand four hundred fifty-seven patients died in the observation period, thereof 6965 (55.9%) in a hospital. The key factors for increased likelihood of inhospital death were receipt of inpatient palliative care (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.85), chemotherapeutic treatments in the last 30Â days of life (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.61) and comorbid Congestive Heart Failure (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.21), and Renal Disease (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.19). In contrast, higher care level (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.16), nursing home residency (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.25) and receipt of outpatient palliative care (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.25) were associated with a reduced likelihood. All OR were significant (p-values<â€‰0.05). Expenditures in the last 30Â days of life were significantly higher for patients with inhospital death (â‚¬ 6852 vs. â‚¬ 33,254, p-value<â€‰0.0001).ConclusionFindings suggest that factors associated with inhospital death often relate to previous contact with hospitals like prior hospitalizations, and treatment of the tumour or comorbidities. Additionally, factors associated with dying elsewhere relate to access to care settings which are more focused on palliation than hospitals. From these results, we can derive that implementing tools like palliative care into tumour-directed therapy might help patients make self-determined decisions about their place of death. This can possibly be achieved at reduced economic burden for SHIs.",2018,BMC Health Services Research
Ultrahigh dimensional variable selection through the penalized maximum trimmed likelihood estimator,"Abstract The penalized maximum likelihood estimator (PMLE) has been widely used for variable selection in high-dimensional data. Various penalty functions have been employed for this purpose, e.g., Lasso, weighted Lasso, or smoothly clipped absolute deviations. However, the PMLE can be very sensitive to outliers in the data, especially to outliers in the covariates (leverage points). In order to overcome this disadvantage, the usage of the penalized maximum trimmed likelihood estimator (PMTLE) is proposed to estimate the unknown parameters in a robust way. The computation of the PMTLE takes advantage of the same technology as used for PMLE but here the estimation is based on subsamples only. The breakdown point properties of the PMTLE are discussed using the notion of $$d$$-fullness. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated in a simulation study for the classical multiple linear and Poisson linear regression models.",2014,Statistical Papers
Robust estimation of precision matrices under cellwise contamination,"There is a great need for robust techniques in data mining and machine learning contexts where many standard techniques such as principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis are inherently susceptible to outliers. Furthermore, standard robust procedures assume that less than half the observation rows of a data matrix are contaminated, which may not be a realistic assumption when the number of observed features is large. The problem of estimating covariance and precision matrices under cellwise contamination is investigated. The use of a robust pairwise covariance matrix as an input to various regularisation routines, such as the graphical lasso, QUIC and CLIME is considered. A method that transforms a symmetric matrix of pairwise covariances to the nearest covariance matrix is used to ensure the input covariance matrix is positive semidefinite. The result is a potentially sparse precision matrix that is resilient to moderate levels of cellwise contamination. Since this procedure is not based on subsampling it scales well as the number of variables increases.",2016,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Gene expression Gradient lasso for Cox proportional hazards model,"Motivation: There has been an increasing interest in expressing a survival phenotype (e.g. time to cancer recurrence or death) or its distribution in terms of a subset of the expression data of a subset of genes. Due to high dimensionality of gene expression data, however, there is a serious problem of collinearity in fitting a prediction model, e.g. Coxâ€™s proportional hazards model. To avoid the collinearity problem, several methods based on penalized Cox proportional hazards models have been proposed. However, those methods suffer from severe computational problems, such as slow or even failed convergence, because of high-dimensional matrix inversions required for model fitting. We propose to implement the penalized Cox regression with a lasso penalty via the gradient lasso algorithm that yields faster convergence to the global optimum than do other algorithms. Moreover the gradient lasso algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimum under mild regularity conditions. Hence, our gradient lasso algorithm can be a useful tool in developing a prediction model based on high-dimensional covariates including gene expression data. Results: Results from simulation studies showed that the prediction model by gradient lasso recovers the prognostic genes. Also results from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma datasets and Norway/Stanford breast cancer dataset indicate that our method is very competitive compared with popular existing methods by Park and Hastie and Goeman in its computational time, prediction and selectivity.

Uniform Inference in High-dimensional Dynamic Panel Data Models,"We establish oracle inequalities for a version of the Lasso in high-dimensional fixed effects dynamic panel data models. The inequalities are valid for the coefficients of the dynamic and exogenous regressors. Separate oracle inequalities are derived for the fixed effects. Next, we show how one can conduct uniformly valid simultaneous inference on the parameters of the model and construct a uniformly valid estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix which is robust to conditional heteroskedasticity in the error terms. Allowing for conditional heteroskedasticity is important in dynamic models as the conditional error variance may be non-constant over time and depend on the covariates. Furthermore, our procedure allows for inference on high-dimensional subsets of the parameter vector of an increasing cardinality. We show that the confidence bands resulting from our procedure are asymptotically honest and contract at the optimal rate. This rate is different for the fixed effects than for the remaining parts of the parameter vector.",2015,arXiv: Statistics Theory
A Novel Combined Electricity Price Forecasting Method Based on Data Driven Algorithms,"In the deregulated electricity market, accurate knowledge of electricity price tend helps maximize the profitability of the participants in the electricity market, so electricity price forecasting becomes extremely important. On the basis of not considering the situation of the electricity market itself and many factors affecting the electricity price, the historical load and electricity price are used as inputs to predict the electricity price from the perspective of data driven. The Lasso, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and BP Neural Network methods are used to establish a single algorithmic electricity price model respectively, and then the linear Lasso and nonlinear BP neural network are used to make combined the prediction results of four single algorithmic electricity price models. Finally, the actual electricity price and load data from Queensland are used for simulation. The simulation results show that: (i) Among the four electricity price models, BP neural network model has the highest accuracy, and the average absolute error is 6.034. The Random Forests model has the worst accuracy, with an average absolute error of 9.669. (ii) The combined nonlinear BP neural network model can predict the electricity price more accurately with an average absolute error of 4.641.",2019,"2019 IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference and Expo, Asia-Pacific (ITEC Asia-Pacific)"
Variable Selection in Heterogeneous Datasets: A Truncated-rank Sparse Linear Mixed Model with Applications to Genome-wide Association Studies,"A fundamental and important challenge in modern datasets of ever increasing dimensionality is variable selection, which has taken on renewed interest recently due to the growth of biological and medical datasets with complex, non-i.i.d. structures. NaÃ¯vely applying classical variable selection methods such as the Lasso to such datasets may lead to a large number of false discoveries. Motivated by genome-wide association studies in genetics, we study the problem of variable selection for datasets arising from multiple subpopulations, when this underlying population structure is unknown to the researcher. We propose a unified framework for sparse variable selection that adaptively corrects for population structure via a low-rank linear mixed model. Most importantly, the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of sample structure in the data and adaptively selects a covariance structure of the correct complexity. Through extensive experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of this framework over existing methods. Further, we test our method on three different genomic datasets from plants, mice, and human, and discuss the knowledge we discover with our method.",2017,bioRxiv
On the possibility of a two-bang supernova collapse,"SummaryThe possibility of a two-bang stellar collapse originating SN 1987a, and having the characteristics of the events recorded in Mont Blanc and Kamiokande, is discussed here. According to the Â«standardÂ» collapse models of nonrotating stars, which predict the formation of a neutrinosphere with a nondegenerate neutrino gas inside the star, the Mont Blanc and Kamiokande data for the first burst give a too large stellar mass. On the contrary, a degenerate neutrino gas with low temperatureTâ‰ˆ0.5 MeV, and chemical potential Î¼â‰ˆ(12Ã·15), predicts a relatively low total energy outflowWÎ½â‰ˆ(2Ã·6)Â·1054 erg, and a small number of expected interactions in Kamiokande. A possible scenario is suggested: a massive (Mâ‰ˆ20MâŠ™) rotating star is fragmented into two pieces, one light and the other heavy, at the onset of the collapse. The massive component collapses to a black hole, and produces the first burst. Neutrinos are trapped inside the collapsing star because of elastic scattering in the outer core off heavy nuclei, withAâ‰³300. It is shown that neutrinos fill up the quantum states, producing a degenerate neutrino gas. The second burst is explained by coalescence of the light fragment (Mâ‰ˆ(1Ã·3)MâŠ™) onto the massive black hole. The time delay between the two observed bursts (4.7 h) is mostly connected with gravitational braking, when the light fragment falls down onto the black hole, with an accompanying emission of gravitational waves for times of order of hours.RiassuntoSi discute la possibilitÃ  che la supernova 1987a abbia avuto origine da un collasso a due stadi, avente le caratteristiche degli eventi registrati nell'Osservatorio Neutrinico del Monte Bianco e nell'esperimento di Kamioka. Secondo i modelli Â«standardÂ» di collasso di stelle senza rotazione, che prevedono la formazione di una neutrinosfera con un gas non degenere di neutrini al suo interno, i dati del Monte Bianco e di Kamioka per il primo burst comportano un valore troppo alto della massa stellare. Al contrario, un gas degenere di neutrini a bassa temperatureTâˆ¼0.5 MeV e con potenziale chimico Î¼âˆ¼(12Ã·15) comporta un'emissione totale in neutrini relativamente bassaWÎ½âˆ¼(2Ã·6)Â·1054 erg ed un piccolo numero di interazioni in Kamiokande. Si suggerisce un possibile scenario: una stella massiva (Mâˆ¼20MâŠ™) in rotazione si frammenta in due oggetti, uno leggero e l'altro pesante, all'inizio del collasso. L'oggetto massivo collassa in un buco nero e produce il primo burst. I neutrini vengono intrappolati entro la stella collassante a causa dello scattering elastico nel core esterno dovuto a nuclei pesanti, conAâ‰³300. Si mostra che i neutrini riempiono gli stati quantici, producendo un gas degenere di neutrini. Il secondo burst Ã¨ spiegato dalla caduta del frammento leggeroMâˆ¼(1Ã·3)MâŠ™ sul black hole massivo.Ð ÐµÐ·ÑŽÐ¼ÐµÐ’ Ñ€Ð°Ð±Ð¾Ñ‚Ðµ Ð¾Ð±ÑÑƒÐ¶Ð´Ð°ÐµÑ‚ÑÑ Ð²Ð¾Ð·Ð¼Ð¾Ð¶Ð½Ð¾ÑÑ‚ÑŒ ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð»Ð°Ð¿ÑÐ° ÑÐ²ÐµÑ€Ñ…Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¾Ð¹ SN 1987a, Ñ…Ð°Ñ€Ð°ÐºÑ‚ÐµÑ€Ð¸Ð·ÑƒÑŽÑ‰ÐµÐ³Ð¾ÑÑ Ð´Ð²ÑƒÐ¼Ñ Ð²Ð·Ñ€Ñ‹Ð²Ð°Ð¼Ð¸ Ð¸ Ð¸Ð¼ÐµÑŽÑ‰ÐµÐ³Ð¾ Ð¾ÑÐ¾Ð±ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾ÑÑ‚Ð¸, Ð·Ð°Ñ€ÐµÐ³Ð¸ÑÑ‚Ñ€Ð¸Ñ€Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð½Ñ‹Ðµ Ð½Ð° ÐœÐ¾Ð½ Ð‘Ð»Ð°Ð½Ðµ Ð¸ Ð² ÐšÐ°Ð¼Ð¸Ð¾ÐºÐ°Ð½Ð´Ðµ.

Comparison of the performance of three ion mobility spectrometers for measurement of biogenic amines.,"The performance of three different types of ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) devices: GDA2 with a radioactive ion source (Airsense, Germany), UV-IMS with a photo-ionization source (G.A.S. Germany) and VG-Test with a corona discharge source (3QBD, Israel) was studied. The gas-phase ion chemistry in the IMS devices affected the species formed and their measured reduced mobility values. The sensitivity and limit of detection for trimethylamine (TMA), putrescine and cadaverine were compared by continuous monitoring of a stream of air with a given concentration of the analyte and by measurement of headspace vapors of TMA in a sealed vial. Preprocessing of the mobility spectra and the effectiveness of multivariate curve resolution techniques (MCR-LASSO) improved the accuracy of the measurements by correcting baseline effects and adjusting for variations in drift time as well as enhancing the signal to noise ratio and deconvolution of the complex data matrix to their pure components. The limit of detection for measurement of the biogenic amines by the three IMS devices was between 0.1 and 1.2ppm (for TMA with the VG-Test and GDA, respectively) and between 0.2 and 0.7ppm for putrescine and cadaverine with all three devices. Considering the uncertainty in the LOD determination there is almost no statistically significant difference between the three devices although they differ in their operating temperature, ionization method, drift tube design and dopant chemistry. This finding may have general implications on the achievable performance of classic IMS devices.",2013,Analytica chimica acta
Significance of tumor-infiltrating immunocytes for predicting prognosis of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma,"BACKGROUND
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been recognized as a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Numerous reports suggest that immune infiltration can predict the prognosis of HCC. Nonetheless, no creditable markers for prognosis of HBV-related HCC have been established by systematically assessing the immune-related markers based on tumor transcriptomes.


AIM
To establish an immune-related marker based on the cell compositions of immune infiltrate obtained based on tumor transcriptomes, so as to enhance the prediction accuracy of HBV-related HCC prognosis.


METHODS
RNA expression patterns as well as the relevant clinical data of HCC patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Twenty-two immunocyte fraction types were estimated by cell type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts. Subsequently, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model was employed to construct an immunoscore based on the immunocyte fraction types. Afterwards, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Kaplan-Meier, and multivariate Cox analyses were performed. Additionally, a nomogram for prognosis that integrated the immunoscore as well as the clinical features was established. Meanwhile, the correlation of immunoscore with immune genes was also detected, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the immunoscore was conducted.


RESULTS
A total of 22 immunocyte fraction types were predicted and compared among the tumor as well as non-tumor samples. An immunoscore was constructed through adopting the LASSO model, which contained eight immunocyte fraction types. Meanwhile, the areas under the ROC curves for the immunoscore biomarker prognostic model were 0.971, 0.912, and 0.975 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS), respectively. Difference in OS between the high-immunoscore group and the low-immunoscore group was statistically significant [hazard ratio (HR) = 66.007, 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.361-521.105; P < 0.0001]. Moreover, multivariable analysis showed that the immunoscore was an independent factor for predicting the prognosis (HR = 2.997, 95%CI: 1.737-5.170). A nomogram was established, and the C-index was 0.757 (95%CI: 0.648-0.866). The immunoscore showed a significant negative correlation with the expression of PD-1 (P = 0.024), PD-L1 (P = 0.026), PD-L2 (P = 0.029), and CD27 (P = 0.033). Eight pathways were confirmed by GSEA.


CONCLUSION
The established immunoscore can potentially serve as a candidate marker to estimate the OS for HBV-related HCC cases.",2019,World Journal of Gastroenterology
Fast Approximate GMM Soft-Assign for Fine-Grained Image Classification with Large Fisher Vectors,"We address two drawbacks of image classification with large Fisher vectors. The first drawback is the computational cost of assigning a large number of patch descriptors to a large number of GMM components. We propose to alleviate that by a generally applicable approximate soft-assignment procedure based on a balanced GMM tree. This approximation significantly reduces the computational complexity while only marginally affecting the fine-grained classification performance. The second drawback is a very high dimensionality of the image representation, which makes the classifier learning and inference computationally complex and prone to overtraining. We propose to alleviate that by regularizing the classification model with group Lasso. The resulting block-sparse models achieve better fine-grained classification performance in addition to memory savings and faster prediction. We demonstrate and evaluate our contributions on a standard fine-grained categorization benchmark.",2015,

En aquest sentit shan desenvolupat metodologies analitiques aplicades a lanalisi daquests compostos tant en aigues com en solids suspesos i sediments.
Lestudi del comportament daquests compostos en aiguamolls construits (de flux superficial i subsuperficial) sha realitzat des de dos enfocaments diferents. El primer dells es la injeccio directa dels contaminants destudi, conjuntament amb un tracador mentre que el segon estudia latenuacio dels PPCPs presents a laigua residual a mesura que aquests travessen laiguamoll.
Com a resultat daquest estudi sha constatat una major eficiencia en leliminacio de gran part dels contaminants en aquells sistemes on hi predominen les rutes metaboliques
aerobies. En aquest sentit, la transferencia doxigen als aiguamolls a traves de la vegetacio sha vinculat amb un increment en leliminacio de contaminants organics.
Daltra banda, es demostra com les interaccions daquests compostos amb la materia organica i el conjunt de la rizosfera tenen un paper clau a lhora deliminar-los, sobretot
quan es tracta de compostos mes hidrofobics.
Finalment, en lestudi de la formacio de subproductes de desinfeccio en aigues residuals regenerades, sha demostrat que la presencia damoni en els efluents de les EDARs disminueix el risc de formacio de trihalometans, essent un parametre clau per tal de controlar la formacio daquests compostos.
""SUMMARY:
Water of quality is a scarce and essential resource for human development. Then wastewater treatment and water reuse and reclamation are of high importance in order to assure a sustainable management of this resource.
The work carried out in this thesis has been splitted in two parts, the first one related to the study of the behavior of organic pollutants in constructed wetlands and the other one to the evaluation of disinfection by-products formation during regeneration processes. The organic pollutants considered can be classified in three classes; pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), the ones included as priority substances by the EU Framework Directive 2000/60/EC and the disinfection by-products. In this sense, analytical methodologies have been developed in order to analyze these compounds in water, suspended solids and sediments.
The behavior of these compounds in constructed wetlands (surface and subsurface flow) has been assessed by both, the injection of pollutants with a tracer, and by studying the attenuation of organic pollutants already present in raw wastewater. As a result of these studies, it has been observed the highest removal efficiencies in vertical flow constructed wetlands where organic matter removal is predominantly by aerobic pathways. Consequently a positive vegetation effect has been observed due to its increase on oxygen transfer to the system. On the other hand, it has been shown that organic pollutants have a high interaction with the organic matter and the rizosphere and that is more relevant for the hydrophobic ones.
Finally, in the study of disinfection by-products formation, it was observed that the presence of ammonium in WWTPs effluents decrease the risk of trihalomethanes formation. """,2007,
Safe utilization of ibrutinib with or without steroids in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia,"Dear Editor, We report two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) both of which responded to ibrutinib. The first patient was diagnosed with Rai stage 1 CLL with del(13q) at the age of 61. For approximately 5 years, he received several courses of chlorambucil. He later developed a direct antiglobulin test (DAT)-positive warm AIHA that responded to steroids. His AIHA relapsed 5 years later: hemoglobin of 85 g/L, reticulocyte count 126Ã—10/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 481 U/L, and undetectable haptoglobin (Table 1). Oral prednisone 1 mg/kg daily was started. At the time of relapse, he was also on cyclophosphamide 100 mg daily to treat his underlying CLL. Cyclophosphamide was discontinued 5 months later due to intolerable side effects, and ibrutinib 420 mg daily was started. His anemia had improved; however, ongoing signs of hemolysis were evident prior to ibrutinib and persisted during the initial weeks of therapy. After 16 weeks, his hemolytic parameters normalized and there were further improvements in his anemia: hemoglobin 105 to 120 g/L. These findings have been persistent and he is tolerating ibrutinib well. The second patient was diagnosed with Rai stage 0 CLL with del(13q) at the age of 55 and received several courses of chlorambucil as well. She developed AIHA 12 years later: hemoglobin 60 g/L, total bilirubin 70 umol/L, LDH 1725 U/L, undetectable haptoglobin, and positive DAT with nonspecific eluate (Table 1). Her anemia improved to normal with a course of steroids completed over 2 months and six cycles of cyclophosphamide; however, despite normalization of her hemoglobin, she continued to show signs of hemolysis. Just over a year after steroid discontinuation, she required treatment for symptomatic lymphadenopathy. Ibrutinib 420 mg daily was started, and 8 weeks after initiation, all hemolytic parameters normalized and have remained stable. Our findings are consistent with the report by Manda et al. who showed the efficacy of ibrutinib in CLLassociated AIHA in a patient initially treated with steroids and later ibrutinib [1]. However, we are the first to demonstrate that even in the absence of recent prednisone use, ibrutinib is effective in treating AIHA. This is an important distinction given that CLL therapies such as fludarabine have been associated with worsening of AIHA when used in isolation [2]. In contrast, a recent report by Rider et al. has suggested a causal relationship between ibrutinib and onset of severe CLL-associated AIHA. Clearly, more reports are needed to determine if there are certain patient factors that can predict the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in this context [3]. Based on genome-wide association studies, B cell receptor-associated signaling molecules such as BTK, the target of ibrutinib, play a role in the development of several autoimmune conditions [4]. Ibrutinib can also modulate cytokine levels and likely block the activation of certain T cell subsets and potentiate the Th-1-mediated immune responses, both implicated in autoimmune disease [5, 6]. Animal models of autoimmunity show inhibition of disease development and decreased antibody production with ibrutinib [7, 8]. These findings suggest that there may be a role for studies to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib in cases of primary AIHA. * Cyrus C. Hsia chsia@uwo.ca",2015,Annals of Hematology
[Preoperative evaluation of histologic grade in invasive breast cancer with T2W-MRI based radiomics signature].,"OBJECTIVE
To develop and validate a fat-suppressed (T2 weighted-magnetic resonance imaging, T2W-MRI) based radiomics signature to preoperatively evaluate the histologic grade (grade I/II VS. grade III) of invasive breast cancer.â€© Methods: A total of 202 patients with MRI examination and pathologically confirmed invasive breast cancer from June 2011 to February 2017 were retrospectively enrolled. After retrieving fat-suppressed T2W images and tumor segmentation, radiomics features were extracted and valuable features were selected to build a radiomic signature with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. Mann-Whitney U test was used to explore the correlation between radiomics signature and histologic grade. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was applied to determine the discriminative performance of the radiomics signature [area under curre (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy]. An independent validation dataset was used to confirm the discriminatory power of radiomics signature. â€© Results: Eight radiomics features were selected to build a radiomics signature, which showed good performance for preoperatively evaluating histologic grade of invasive breast cancer, with an AUC of 0.802 (95% CI 0.729 to 0.875), sensitivity of 78.7%, specificity of 70.3% and accuracy of 73.7% in training dataset and AUC of 0.812 (95% CI 0.686 to 0.938), sensitivity of 80.0%, specificity of 73.3% and accuracy of 76.0% in the validation dataset.â€© Conclusion: The fat-suppressed T2W-MRI based radiomics signature can be used to preoperatively evaluate the histologic grade of invasive breast cancer, which may assist clinical decision-maker.",2019,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Prospects of applying 3-D printing to economics of remote communities,"Purpose 
 
 
 
 
Isolated communities face a variety of inconveniences including severe remoteness, poor roads and extreme climate conditions, resulting in the lack of security of supply chains and exorbitant prices for cargo delivery. This paper aims to investigate the present advantages and prospects of applying 3-D printing to improve economics and everyday life of remote communities, reindeer herder case taken as an example. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
This study covers the use of a low-cost open-source 3-D printer (RepRap) capable of fused filament fabrication to reduce operating costs for nomadic reindeer herder groups. Three case studies are provided for reindeer-specific applications to probe economic and technical viability of the technology, namely, ear-tags, electric fence components and lasso accessories. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
3-D printed objects feature technical characteristics similar to those of analogues available on the market while reducing the price by 63 per cent. Distributed 3-D printing reduces the cost of raw materials by 68 per cent and shipping costs by 50 because of lower trip frequency. If all reindeer herders globally were to adopt distributed manufacturing of the three aforementioned sample items only, their annual savings from such solution would amount to US$2m. The paper discovers other economic, entrepreneurial, technical and environmental opportunities offered by 3-D printing put to service the needs of remote communities. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations 
 
 
 
 
As the paper is the first-ever study of 3-D printing potential applied to the reindeer husbandry case, it is based on a more thorough analysis of the techno-economic feasibility of the technology, while cultural and entrepreneurial factors have been discussed as preconditions only. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
The paper might serve as a valuable source of information for entrepreneurs, as well as for students and academics for further case studies in this area. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
In remote conditions, 3-D printing offers a more sustainable way of good manufacturing. Numerous open source designs already available for specialists, financial effectiveness, environmental benefits and vast opportunities for entrepreneurs are among the most promising advantages of the technology.",2018,Journal of Enterprising Communities: People and Places in The Global Economy
Genome-wide association study for milk total unsaturated fatty acids in Brazilian Holstein cows,"The effects of milk fatty acids in human health have encouraged the research of the genetic control under this trait. In this scenario, the objective in this study was to identify the main single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for total unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) content in a Holstein population reared under tropical conditions. Estimated breeding values (EBV) for UFA content were associated to 6,971 SNP for 757 cows by using Bayesian LASSO methodology. Of these, two SNP in chromosome 14 were responsible for 4.96 and 4.12% of the additive SNP variance, probably because of their proximity with DGAT1 gene. SNP were also identified in chromosomes 2, 11 and 18. The small effects of the majority of SNP confirmed the polygenic nature of this trait. However, the use of genetic markers can improve genetic selection for milk fatty acids.",2014,

Identification of a 4â€mRNA metastasisâ€related prognostic signature for patients with breast cancer,"Metastasis-related mRNAs have showed great promise as prognostic biomarkers in various types of cancers. Therefore, we attempted to develop a metastasis-associated gene signature to enhance prognostic prediction of breast cancer (BC) based on gene expression profiling. We firstly screened and identified 56 differentially expressed mRNAs by analysing BC tumour tissues with and without metastasis in the discovery cohort (GSE102484, nÂ =Â 683). We then found 26 of these differentially expressed genes were associated with metastasis-free survival (MFS) in the training set (GSE20685, nÂ =Â 319). A metastasis-associated gene signature built using a LASSO Cox regression model, which consisted of four mRNAs, can classify patients into high- and low-risk groups in the training cohort. Patients with high-risk scores in the training cohort had shorter MFS (hazard ratio [HR] 3.89, 95% CI 2.53-5.98; PÂ <Â 0.001), disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 4.69, 2.93-7.50; PÂ <Â 0.001) and overall survival (HR 4.06, 2.56-6.45; PÂ <Â 0.001) than patients with low-risk scores. The prognostic accuracy of mRNAs signature was validated in the two independent validation cohorts (GSE21653, nÂ =Â 248; GSE31448, nÂ =Â 246). We then developed a nomogram based on the mRNAs signature and clinical-related risk factors (T stage and N stage) that predicted an individual's risk of disease, which can be assessed by calibration curves. Our study demonstrated that this 4-mRNA signature might be a reliable and useful prognostic tool for DFS evaluation and will facilitate tailored therapy for BC patients at different risk of disease.",2019,Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine

Forecasting financial outcomes using variable selection techniques,"Since the activities of market participants can be influenced by financial outcomes, providing accurate forecasts of these financial outcomes can help participants to reduce the risk of adjusting to any market change in the future. Predictions of financial outcomes have usually been obtained by conventional statistical models based on researchersâ€™ knowledge. With the development of data collection and storage, an extensive set of explanatory variables will be extracted from big data capturing more economic theories and then applied to predictive methods, which can increase the difficulty of model interpretation and produce biased estimation. This may further reduce predictive ability. To overcome these problems, variable selection techniques are frequently employed to simplify model selection and produce more accurate forecasts. In this PhD thesis, we aim to combine variable selection approaches with traditional reduced-form models to define and forecast the financial outcomes in question (market implied ratings, Initial Public Offering (IPO) decisions and the failure of companies). This provides benefits for market participants in detecting potential investment opportunities and reducing credit risk. 
Making accurate predictions of corporate credit ratings is a crucial issue for both investors and rating agencies, since firmsâ€™ credit ratings are associated with financial flexibility and debt or equity issuance. In Chapter 2, we attempt to determine market-implied credit ratings in relation to financial ratios, market-driven factors and macroeconomic indicators. We conclude that applying variable selection techniques, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and its extension (Elastic net) can improve predictive power. Moreover, the predictive ability of LASSO-selected models is clearly better than that of the benchmark ordered probit model in all out-of-sample predictions. Finally, fewer predictors can be selected into LASSO models controlled by BIC-type tuning parameter to produce more accurate out-of-sample prediction than its counterpart AIC-type selector. 
Next, the LASSO technique is further applied to binary event prediction. A bankâ€™s decision to go public by issuing an Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the binary object in Chapter 3, which transforms the operations and capital structure of a bank. Much of the empirical investigation in this area focuses on the determinants of the IPO decision, applying accounting ratios and other publicly available information in non-linear models. We mark a break with this literature by offering methodological extensions as well as an extensive and updated US dataset to predict bank IPOs. Combining the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with a Cox proportional hazard, we uncover value in several financial factors as well as market-driven and macroeconomic variables, in predicting a bankâ€™s decision to go public. Importantly, we document a significant improvement in the modelâ€™s predictive ability compared to standard frameworks used in the literature. Finally, we show that the sensitivity of a bankâ€™s IPO to financial characteristics is higher during periods of global financial crisis than in calmer times. 
Moving to another line of variable selection techniques, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is combined with reduced-form models in Chapter 4. The failure of companies is closely related to the health of the whole economy, since the beginning of the most recent global crisis was the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. In this chapter, we forecast the failure of UK private firms incorporating with financial ratios and macroeconomic variables. Since two important financial crises and firm heterogeneities are covered in our dataset, the predictive powers of candidate models in different periods and cross-sections are validated. We first detect that applying BMA to the discrete hazard models can improve the predictive performance in different sub-periods. However, comparing the results with classified models, it should be noted that the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier provides slightly higher predictive accuracy than BMA models of discrete hazard models. Moreover, the predictive performance of the discrete hazard model and its BMA version are more sensitive to adding time or industry dummy variables than other competing models. Considering financial crisis or firm heterogeneity can influence the predictive power of each candidate model in the out-of-sample prediction of failure.",2019,
Autoimmune myelitis in a CLL patient undergoing treatment with ibrutinib,"Dear Editor, A 46-year-old male patient was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (IGHV mutated, normal karyotype, CD38+, ZAP70+, TP53 status not assessed) 14 years ago. Previous therapies consisted of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone), FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab), and rituximab plus bendamustine. However, 2 months after a thirdline therapy, he required further treatment due to bulky lymphadenopathy, pronounced constitutional symptoms, and lymphocyte doubling time < 3 months (absolute lymphocyte count of 79,6 G/l, platelets 103 G/l, haemoglobin 135 g/l). Cytogenetics revealed a normal karyotype. Ibrutinib 420 mg/ daywas started andwell tolerated resulting in an immediate and complete resolution of B-symptoms and > 70% regression of lymphadenopathy. However, after 1 month, he was referred to our hospital due to paraesthesiaâ€™s starting in the left foot and spreading within hours to the right leg, the pelvic floor, and the genital area, accompanied by bladder dysfunction. Cerebrospinal fluid (cytology, cell count, chemistry, isoelectric focusing, PCR tests for adenovirus, HSV1/2, VZV, CMV, EBV, HHV6, and toxoplasmosis) and serological analyses (including Treponema pallidum, Borrelia burgdorferi, HIV) were normal. Of note, his past medical history was negative for any neurological or autoimmune disease, and thorough neurological and medical assessment revealed no further symptoms. MRI showed signal enhancements of the spinal cord at the thoracolumbar transition and at height TH7 (Fig. 1); cerebral MRI was normal. Based on these findings and the clinical presentation with absence of any signs of infectious disease, a diagnosis of autoimmune myelitis was rendered. Treatment with methylprednisolone 1 g OD over 5 days was administered leading to a prompt but slow neurological improvement while ibrutinib was continued. After 2 months, the bladder dysfunction had completely disappeared but paraesthesias persisted, although to a lesser extent. After 10 months, most neurological symptoms have disappeared with only a slight hypaesthesia of the pelvic floor remaining. Ibrutinib was given for a total of over 2 years, and no further myelitis or other autoimmune symptoms were noted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an autoimmune myelitis occurring during treatment with ibrutinib. Ibrutinib has been shown to ameliorate CLLassociated autoimmune phenomena but may in turn trigger other inflammatory processes [1, 2]. Besides the inhibition of Brutonâ€™s tyrosine kinase (Btk), ibrutinib also inhibits interleukine-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) leading to a Th1 shift due to a decrease in downstream activation of Th2 cells. This imbalance leads to a decrement of potentially autoreactive Th2 cells but also to a pro-inflammatory response of Th1 cells [3, 4]. Th1-mediated immune responses are mainly driven by INF-Î³, TNF-Î±, and IL-2 and associated with various autoimmune disorders including multiple sclerosis and transverse myelitis [5]. Indeed, ibrutinib has been shown to induce such autoimmune phenomena, particular within the first months of treatment (e.g., skin lesions). They seem to be steroid-responsive or even only transient in nature [6, 7]. Although cases of autoimmune phenomena triggered by ibrutinib have been described, and the abovementioned influences of ibrutinib illustrate its impact on autoimmune responses, it has to be admitted that the myelitis possible developed in parallel but not because of ibrutinib treatment. In conclusion, we describe the occurrence and successful treatment of autoimmune myelitis in a CLL patient shortly * David Wanner David.Wanner@tirol-kliniken.at",2018,Annals of Hematology
Priority-Lasso: a simple hierarchical approach to the prediction of clinical outcome using multi-omics data,"BackgroundThe inclusion of high-dimensional omics data in prediction models has become a well-studied topic in the last decades. Although most of these methods do not account for possibly different types of variables in the set of covariates available in the same dataset, there are many such scenarios where the variables can be structured in blocks of different types, e.g., clinical, transcriptomic, and methylation data. To date, there exist a few computationally intensive approaches that make use of block structures of this kind.ResultsIn this paper we present priority-Lasso, an intuitive and practical analysis strategy for building prediction models based on Lasso that takes such block structures into account. It requires the definition of a priority order of blocks of data. Lasso models are calculated successively for every block and the fitted values of every step are included as an offset in the fit of the next step. We apply priority-Lasso in different settings on an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) dataset consisting of clinical variables, cytogenetics, gene mutations and expression variables, and compare its performance on an independent validation dataset to the performance of standard Lasso models.ConclusionThe results show that priority-Lasso is able to keep pace with Lasso in terms of prediction accuracy. Variables of blocks with higher priorities are favored over variables of blocks with lower priority, which results in easily usable and transportable models for clinical practice.",2018,BMC Bioinformatics
Efficient Smoothed Concomitant Lasso Estimation for High Dimensional Regression,"In high dimensional settings, sparse structures are crucial for efficiency, both in term of memory, computation and performance. It is customary to consider 1 penalty to enforce spar-sity in such scenarios. Sparsity enforcing methods, the Lasso being a canonical example, are popular candidates to address high dimension. For efficiency, they rely on tuning a parameter trading data fitting versus sparsity. For the Lasso theory to hold this tuning parameter should be proportional to the noise level, yet the latter is often unknown in practice. A possible remedy is to jointly optimize over the regression parameter as well as over the noise level. This has been considered under several names in the literature: Scaled-Lasso, Square-root Lasso, Concomitant Lasso estimation for instance, and could be of interest for confidence sets or uncertainty quantification. In this work, after illustrating numerical difficulties for the Smoothed Concomitant Lasso formulation, we propose a modification we coined Smoothed Concomitant Lasso, aimed at increasing numerical stability. We propose an efficient and accurate solver leading to a computational cost no more expansive than the one for the Lasso. We leverage on standard ingredients behind the success of fast Lasso solvers: a coordinate descent algorithm, combined with safe screening rules to achieve speed efficiency, by eliminating early irrelevant features.",2016,ArXiv
"Four pairs of geneâ€“gene interactions associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes (CDKN2BASâ€“KCNJ11), obesity (SLC2A9â€“IGF2BP2, FTOâ€“APOA5), and hypertension (MC4Râ€“IGF2BP2) in Chinese women","Metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, obesity and hypertension have growing prevalence globally every year. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified many genetic markers associated to these diseases, but few studied their interaction effects. In this study, twenty candidate SNPs from sixteen genes are selected, and a lasso-multiple regression approach is implemented to consider the SNP-SNP interactions among them in an Asian population. It is found out that the main effects of the markers are weak but the interactions among the candidates showed a significant association to diseases. SNPs from genes CDKN2BAS and KCNJ11 are significantly associated to risk for developing diabetes, and SNPs from FTO and APOA5 might interact to play an important role for the onset of hypertension.",2014,Meta Gene

Stable variable selection for right censored data: comparison of methods,"The instability in the selection of models is a major concern with data sets containing a large number of covariates. This paper deals with variable selection methodology in the case of high-dimensional problems where the response variable can be right censored. We focuse on new stable variable selection methods based on bootstrap for two different methodologies commonly used in survival analysis: the Cox proportional hazard model and survival trees. As far as the Cox model is concerned, we investigate the bootstrapping applied to two variable selection techniques: the stepwise algorithm based on the AIC criterion and the L1-penalization of Lasso. Regarding survival trees, we review two methodologies: the bootstrap node-level stabilization and random survival forests. We apply these different approaches to two real data sets, a classical breast cancer data set and an original infertility data set. We compare the methods on two criteria: the prediction error rate based on the Harrell concordance index and the relevance of the interpretation of the corresponding selected models, focusing on the original infertility data set. The aim is to find a compromise between a good prediction performance and ease to interpretation for clinicians. Results suggest that in the case of a small number of individuals, a bootstrapping adapted to L1-penalization in the Cox model or a bootstrap node-level stabilization in survival trees give a good alternative to the random survival forest methodology, known to give the smallest prediction error rate but difficult to interprete by non-statisticians. In a clinical perspective, the complementarity between the methods based on the Cox model and those based on survival trees would permit to built reliable models easy to interprete by the clinician.",2012,arXiv: Applications
Estimating the trend in US real GDP using the â„“1 trend filtering,"ABSTRACTUsing non-Gaussian state-space models, Perron and Wada (2009, Journal of Monetary Economics, 56, 749â€“765) obtained a nearly piecewise linear trend estimate of US real gross domestic product such that its slope changed around 1973. Such a trend may be regarded as a result of occasional permanent shocks to the growth rate. This article shows that the trend filtering, which is quite similar to the Hodrickâ€“Prescott filtering and is a type of the recently popular lasso regression, yields almost the same trend estimate, and discusses the reason why this occurs.",2017,Applied Economics Letters
Triangle Lasso for Simultaneous Clustering and Optimization in Graph Datasets,"Recently, network lasso has dawn much attention due to its remarkable performance on simultaneous clustering and optimization. However, it usually suffers from the imperfect data (noise, missing values, etc.), and yields sub-optimal solutions. The reason is that it finds the similar instances according to their features directly, which is usually impacted by the imperfect data, and thus returns sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose triangle lasso to avoid its disadvantage for graph datasets. In a graph dataset, each instance is represented by a vertex. If two instances have many common adjacent vertices, they tend to become similar. Although some instances are profiled by the imperfect data, it is still able to find the similar counterparts. Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to obtain a moderately accurate solution. In addition, we present a dual method to obtain the accurate solution with the low additional time consumption. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that triangle lasso is robust to the imperfect data. It usually yields a better performance than the state-of-the-art method when performing data analysis tasks in practical scenarios.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering
Structure of the Lasso Peptide Isopeptidase Identifies a Topology for Processing Threaded Substrates.,"Lasso peptides are a class of bioactive ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), with a threaded knot structure that is formed by an isopeptide bond attaching the N-terminus of the peptide to a side chain carboxylate. Some lasso peptide biosynthetic clusters harbor an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes the isopeptide bond to yield the linear peptide. We describe here the 2.4 Ã… resolution structure of a lasso peptide isopeptidase revealing a topologically novel didomain architecture consisting of an open Î²-propeller appended to an Î±/Î² hydrolase domain. The 2.2 Ã… resolution cocrystal structure of an inactive variant in complex with a lasso peptide reveals deformation of the substrate, and reorganization of the enzyme active site, which exposes and orients the isopeptide bond for hydrolysis. Structure-based mutational analysis reveals how this enzyme recognizes the lasso peptide substrate by shape complementarity rather than through sequence specificity. The isopeptidase gene can be used to facilitate genome mining, as a network-based mining strategy queried with this sequence identified 87 putative lasso peptide biosynthetic clusters, 65 of which have not been previously described. Lastly, we validate this mining approach by heterologous expression of two clusters encoded within the genome of Asticcaucalis benevestitus, and demonstrate that both clusters produce lasso peptides.",2016,Journal of the American Chemical Society
Predictive Modeling in Race Walking,This paper presents the use of linear and nonlinear multivariable models as tools to support training process of race walkers. These models are calculated using data collected from race walkers' training events and they are used to predict the result over a 3â€‰km race based on training loads. The material consists of 122 training plans for 21 athletes. In order to choose the best model leave-one-out cross-validation method is used. The main contribution of the paper is to propose the nonlinear modifications for linear models in order to achieve smaller prediction error. It is shown that the best model is a modified LASSO regression with quadratic terms in the nonlinear part. This model has the smallest prediction error and simplified structure by eliminating some of the predictors.,2015,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience
LARS-type algorithm for group lasso,"The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) has been widely used in regression analysis. Based on the piecewise linear property of the solution path, least angle regression provides an efficient algorithm for computing the solution paths of lasso. Group lasso is an important generalization of lasso that can be applied to regression with grouped variables. However, the solution path of group lasso is not piecewise linear and hence cannot be obtained by least angle regression. By transforming the problem into a system of differential equations, we develop an algorithm for efficient computation of group lasso solution paths. Simulation studies are conducted for comparing the proposed algorithm to the best existing algorithm: the groupwise-majorization-descent algorithm.",2017,Statistics and Computing
Life History Studies of Three Digenetic Trematodes (Digenea: Cryptogonimidae).,"Two new species of cryptogonimid trematodes belonging to genera Caecincola and Cryp to cron imus are described. A close resemblance was discovered among the developmental stages and hosts involved in the life cycles of these new species and Textrema hopkinsi. All three species employ the hydrobiid snail Cincinnatia peracuta as the first host, several members of the genus Lepomis and Elassoma zonatum as second intermediates, and Micropterus salmoides and M. punctulatus as final hosts. Life cycle and morphological similarities among the three trematodes dictate a suppresÂ­ sion of subfamily Caecincolinae and inclusion of its members, along with genus Textrema, in subfamily Cryp togon imin ae. Life history observation revealed basically similar cercarial emergence patterns for the new species of Caecincola and T. hopkinsi. A differential metacercarial and adult development was evident for all three species, and consistently disparate population sizes were noted at False River, Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana. A strong correlation between the infection levels in invertebrate and vertebrate hosts was manifest. Some factors possibly contributing to these population differences are discussed.",1977,
"Bryophyte Records from the Semiarid Steppe of Northwestern North America, Including Four Species","New records from a bryophyte survey of the British Columbia shrub-steppe include four mosses new to North America: Crossidium rosei Williams, Phascum vlassovii Lazar., Pottia wilsonii (Hook.) B.S.G., and Pterygoneurum kozlovii Lazar. In addition, two genera--Trichosto- mopsis and Crossidium--seven species, and two varieties are reported new to Canada, and seven species are new to British Columbia. Two species are reported new from Washington State and one variety from Washington and Oregon. Although dryland vegetation dominates much of the western half of North America, it remains large- ly undercollected by bryologists. Research in these regions is represented mainly by local lists or ad- ditions to these lists, with the few more compre- hensive bryophyte floras useful but not adequate (Churchill 1976, 1979; Flowers 1961, 1973; Frye & Clark 1937-1947; Grout 1928-1941; Lawton 1971). A recent survey of the shrub-steppe of southern British Columbia (McIntosh 1986) underlines the importance of more detailed research in arid re- gions. Although the bryoflora in this rather restrict- ed area totalled only 77 species (72 mosses and five liverworts), many represented significant range ex- tensions. These taxa are reported here: Four species are new to North America, two genera, seven species and two varieties are new to Canada, and seven species are new to British Columbia. From addi- tional collections, two species are newly reported from Washington State and one variety from both Washington and Oregon. This high number of range extensions, some of them thousands of kilometers from their closest previous stations, was surprising.",1989,
Estimation of Sparse Functional Additive Models with Adaptive Group LASSO,"We study a flexible model to address the lack of fit in conventional functional linear regression models. This model, called the sparse functional additive model, is used to characterize the relationship between a functional predictor and a scalar response of interest. The effect of the functional predictor is represented in a nonparametric additive form, where the arguments are the scaled functional principal component scores. Component selection and smoothing are considered when fitting the model in order to reduce the variability and enhance the prediction accuracy, while providing an adequate fit. To achieve these goals, we propose using the adaptive group LASSO method to select relevant components and smoothing splines and, thus, obtain a smoother estimate of those relevant components. Simulation studies show that the proposed estimation method compares favorably with conventional methods in terms of prediction accuracy and component selection. Furthermore, the advantages of our estimation method are demonstrated using two real-data examples.",2020,Statistica Sinica
178 Prediction of Optimal Intervals of Radiological Surveillance for Workers at Different Risks of Silicosis - Chinaâ€™s Experience,"Objectives To determine the optimal intervals of chest radiographic surveillance for workers at different risks of silicosis. Methods All 3492 workers who were exposed to silica dust during 1964â€“74 in an iron-ore of China were recruited into this historical cohort study, and followed up till 31/12/2008. We obtained workerâ€™s information on socio-demographics, smoking habits, disease history, and lifetime occupational history; these variables were used to develop a risk score system according to a prediction model. The discriminative ability of prediction model was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We determined the optimal interval of radiographic surveillance for workers at different risk of silicosis according to the OSHAâ€™s precedent role (unacceptable risk: >1/1000). Results The model with the best fit was the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox model which showed a good discrimination with an area of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81â€“0.86) under the ROC curve. We classified workers into 3 risk groups according to the score chart, and found the observed probabilities matched well to the predictions. According to the OSHAâ€™s precedent role, we can determine that the initial interval of radiographic surveillance for workers in the low risk group (score Conclusions This study is the first to provide scientific evidence on the optimal intervals of radiographic surveillance for workers at different risk levels of silicosis, whilst cross-setting industry validation in subsequent studies may worth exploring.

Arthroscopic Anterior Talofibular Ligament Repair with Use of a 2-Portal Technique.,"Ankle sprains are common musculoskeletal injuries, with approximately 27,000 occurring every day in the U.S. alone. The anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) is the most commonly injured ligament. Although most acute lateral ankle sprains can be treated conservatively, up to 20% of these injuries result in chronic lateral ankle instability and may require surgical stabilization. Recently, an arthroscopic lateral ankle ligament repair technique has become increasingly popular. This minimally invasive procedure is expected to reduce postoperative pain and promote faster recovery. The current article presents an ATFL repair using a 2-portal, non-distraction arthroscopic technique. Chronic lateral ankle instability refractory to physical therapy for 3 to 6 months is the main indication for surgical treatment, and sufficient quality of ligament tissue remnant is required for arthroscopic repair. Compared with an open procedure, equivalent clinical results and earlier recovery following arthroscopic ATFL repair have been reported. The major steps of the procedure, demonstrated in this video article, are (1) placement of portals for the arthroscopic procedure, (2) suture anchor insertion into the distal aspect of the fibula, (3) needle insertion into the ATFL remnant, (4) a lasso-loop stitch using a suture relay technique, (5) reattachment of the ATFL remnant, and (6) postoperative protocol. Complications are rare, and earlier return to daily activities compared with a standard open technique can be achieved.",2019,JBJS essential surgical techniques
Two Approaches to Interpretation of Hubble Diagram,"Supernovae of type Ia are used as standard candles in modern cosmology, they serve to testcosmological models. Interpretation of the Hubble diagram based on the standard cosmologicalmodel led cosmologists to conclusion that the Universe is ï¬lled mostly with cosmic dust andmysterious dark energy.In this paper we present exact solutions of the Friedmann equation in standard cosmologyand conformal cosmology. The theoretical curves interpolating the Hubble diagram for thelatest supernova data are expressed in an analytical form. The functions belong to the classof meromorphic Weierstrass functions. Both approaches describe the modern Hubble diagramwith the same accuracy. Physical interpretation from the standpoint of conformal cosmologyis preferable, since supernova data are described without using a Î›-term. In the standardcosmology, the Hubble diagram is described by some characteristics: a Hubble parameter (),a deceleration (), and a jerk (). As calculations show, the deceleration parameter changesits sign during the evolution of the Universe, the -parameter remains constant. In the modernera, the Universe expands with acceleration, and in the past its acceleration was negative. Thechange in the sign of acceleration, without a clear physical reason, puzzles cosmologists.It seems obvious to us that to study objects dislocated from us at distances of billions oflight years, we should not use the coordinate time customary for work in laboratories, butthe conformal time. In conformal coordinates, the behavior of photons is described as in theMinkowski space. The time intervals d and d are diï¬€erent, they are related by the scale factor:d = d. The conformal luminosity distance is longer than the standard luminosity distance,which is manifested when observing distant stellar objects. As a result, the eï¬€ective magnitudevalue - the redshift relationship, on which the Hubble diagram is constructed, will be diï¬€erent.Using the conformal Friedmann equation, we introduce the conformal parameters (), (),(). All parameters remain positive during the evolution of the Universe. The scale factorgrows with deceleration. The Universe does not experience a jerk.",2017,
Optimisation of process conditions for lactose hydrolysis in paneer whey with cold-active Î²-galactosidase from psychrophilic Thalassospira frigidphilosprofundus,"The present study was conducted to analyse the physiochemical properties of Indian paneer whey. High concentration of minerals such as potassium, calcium, zinc and sodium, as NaCl, were observed which indicates the suitability of paneer whey in the preparation of beverages. A central composite rotatable design (CCRD) of response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimise the hydrolysis of lactose from whey using cold-active Î²-galactosidase of Thalassospira frigidphilosprofundus. Results indicated that 80% of lactose was hydrolysed atÂ pH of 6.5 at 20Â Â°C in 40Â min in comparison with 40% at 30Â Â°C. This emphasises the potential use of cold-active Î²-galactosidase in dairy industry.",2013,International Journal of Dairy Technology
Sparse Group Selection Through Co-Adaptive Penalties,"Recent work has focused on the problem of conducting linear regression when the number of covariates is very large, potentially greater than the sample size. To facilitate this, one useful tool is to assume that the model can be well approximated by a fit involving only a small number of covariates -- a so called sparsity assumption, which leads to the Lasso and other methods. In many situations, however, the covariates can be considered to be structured, in that the selection of some variables favours the selection of others -- with variables organised into groups entering or leaving the model simultaneously as a special case. This structure creates a different form of sparsity. In this paper, we suggest the Co-adaptive Lasso to fit models accommodating this form of `group sparsity'. The Co-adaptive Lasso is fast and simple to calculate, and we show that it holds theoretical advantages over the Lasso, performs well under a broad set of conclusions, and is very competitive in empirical simulations in comparison with previously suggested algorithms like the Group Lasso and the Adaptive Lasso.",2011,arXiv: Methodology
HLH patients with 48% having a A91V- ORF1 genotype.9 Horne et al found a higher prevalence of perforin mutations in patients from the Middle East and syntaxin mutations,"ORF1 genotype.9 Horne et al found a higher prevalence of perforin mutations in patients from the Middle East and syntaxin mutations in Turkish patients compared with Nordic patients.10 They found no differences in presenting signs and symptoms based on genotype, but reported that patients with perforin mutations presented at median age of 2.3 months, MUNC mutations 6.2 at months, and syntaxin mutations at 14.4 months. Central nervous system disease was more prevalent in patients with perforin mutations versus syntaxin mutations. Ueda et al found that of 40 FHL patients, those with non-sense perforin mutations (FHL2) had higher sIL-2 receptor and ferritin levels and presented after 7 years of age.11 The work by Pagel et al is the result of wellorganized collaborations over many years and shows the power of translational research to better inform us about a rare disease and basic biology. As more mutations in the FHLassociated genes are cataloged we may well learn of other genotype/phenotype associations. One of the important off-shoots of this work is that clinicians may now start thinking about HLH in patients who have chronic diarrhea, hypogammaglobulinemia, platelet function defects, and sensorineural hearing defects and develop cytopenias, fever, elevated ferritin, or other signs of this syndrome.

Imputation of missing data via penalization techniques,"The aim of this master thesis is to give the user an estimate of uncertainty over missing data imputation. The full factorization approach is compared to the state-of-the-art approach of full conditional. The special feature in both algorithms is the penalization techniques. Both algorithms are used with different types of missing data like MAR, MCAR and NMAR. Simulated datasets were conducted with copulas. Simulations were varied in rate of missing observations, refitting times and the use, or not, of LASSO regression for last fit. Results are given in terms of accuracy of predicted values, pooled variance estimates and errors which occurred during programming and runtime. The full factorization approach showed advantages over full conditional especially if one looks on ratios of 10:1 observations to covariables. In cases were covariables were in higher numbers than observations, full conditional and full factorization nearly covered same results when ridge regression was used for all fits. Generally lasso regression did not improve accuracy of imputation results. This result can be generalized for all missing types used and simulations conducted in this master thesis. Imputed observations showed paths which are similar to MCMC bayesian statistics. The imputation steps alternated and converged to certain values. Results were stable when different datasets and seeds for random numbers were processed. Run time for both approaches was high due to errors that occurred in different R packages and functions which are costly in terms of CPU usage.",2015,
Climate risks in West Africa: Bobo-Dioulasso local actorsâ€™ participatory risks management framework,"The paper focuses on the role of multilevel governance in climate change adaptation and risk management, and draws out lessons from the implementation of the UN Habitat Cities and Climate Change Initiatives (CCCI) in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. It describes the process for the formulation of a participatory risk management framework for local actors drawing from empirical investigations undertaken in Bobo-Dioulasso. The paper argues that adaptation needs to be mainstreamed and implemented at local level and to include risk management. Moreover, regulatory capacity of public authorities and balance of power and resources play a major role in this process. After presenting the specific knowledge on climate and environmental challenges and CCCI implementation in Bobo-Dioulasso, the paper describes challenges and opportunities in the implementation of the participatory risk and management framework.",2015,Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability
Selection of Eye-Tracking Stimuli for Prediction by Sparsely Grouped Input Variables for Neural Networks: towards Biomarker Refinement for Autism,"Eye tracking has become a powerful tool in the study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Current, large-scale efforts aim to identify specific eye-tracking stimuli to be used as biomarkers for ASD, with the intention of informing the diagnostic process, monitoring therapeutic response, predicting outcomes, or identifying subgroups with the spectrum. However, there are hundreds of candidate experimental paradigms, each of which contains dozens or even hundreds of individual stimuli. Each stimuli is associated with an array of potential derived outcome variables, thus the number of variables to consider can be enormous. Standard variable selection techniques are not applicable to this problem, because selection must be done at the level of stimuli and not individual variables. In other words, this is a grouped variable selection problem. In this work, we apply lasso, group lasso, and a new technique, Sparsely Grouped Input Variables for Neural Network (SGIN), to select experimental stimuli for group discrimination and regression with clinical variables. Using a dataset obtained from children with and without ASD who were administered a battery containing 109 different stimuli presentations involving 9647 features, we are able to retain strong group separation even with only 11 out of the 109 stimuli. This work sets the stage for concerted techniques designed around engines to iteratively refine and define next-generation biomarkers using eye tracking for psychiatric conditions. http://github.com/beibinli/SGIN",2020,Symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications
[Prolonged convulsion after intoxication of alachlor herbicide (Lasso): a case report].,"We experienced a case of alachlor herbicide (Lasso) intoxication. A 57-year-old man was transported to our hospital by ambulance after ingesting 450 mL of Lasso. He was unconscious and had difficulty in breathing. Gastric lavage was performed after tracheal intubation and the patient was placed on mechanical ventilation. Activated charcoal and laxative were administrated. Even after admission, disturbance of consciousness persisted. He had liver and kidney disorders but these did not progress to multiple organ failure. He experienced convulsions from day 4 and was administered anticonvulsants. Convulsion was intractable and needed long-term treatment. His general condition improved until discharge. He was weaned from mechanical ventilation and recovered consciousness, but he still displayed tremors. The herbicide (Lasso) is a combination of alachlor and monochlorobenzene. Studies have shown that alachlor is neurotoxic and monochlorobenzene accumulates in the brain. In case of intoxication with the herbicide Lasso, treatment is required for ameliorating neurotoxic effects and intractable convulsion as well as liver and kidney disorders, gastrointestinal mucosal damage, hematopoietic disorder, and acute circulatory failure.",2011,Chudoku kenkyu : Chudoku Kenkyukai jun kikanshi = The Japanese journal of toxicology

Ad hoc and sensor networks,"here is a lot of interest in and excitement about multihop wireless networks in both academia and industry. The potential of these types of networks is enormous, but there is still a long way to go for this potential to become reality. In particular, deployment and interoperability issues still have to be worked out, especially for large networks. Currently, the most relevant real applications are military or other surveillance applications. In most cases, the solutions are proprietary and will hardly work in a general context that is different from the one for which they were designed. We have decided to dedicate the second issue of the Series on Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks of IEEE Communications Magazine to these (more) practical problems. A very illustrative example can be found in the mobile ad hoc network (MANET) world, where many routing algorithms have been designed and proposed without taking into consideration the physical layer and other technology issues, so when tested on large experimental testbeds, they have failed to forward packets for more than few hops. Thus, while the research community envisages a physical world full of wireless and mobile embedded devices, reality is still far behind. While on one hand it is very important to continue to research the fundamental issues, on the other hand it is very important to advance the field through critical analysis and experimental studies in order to identify the limits of existing technologies and the physical issues related to commercial deployment. We expect that those critical analysis and experimental studies would cross-fertilize the more theoretical research, and thus speed up the realization of the ubiquitous and pervasive computing and communications vision. The first article of this issue is by Isabelle Guerin Lassous, Claude Chaudet, and Dominique Dhoutaut. It addresses the problem of the applicability of the IEEE 802.11 family suite as the base protocol for ad hoc networks. The authors identify the main causes of performance losses, and their impact on complex ad hoc topologies and higher-layer protocols. Another important issue, in order to deploy general solutions for MANETs, is the ability to consider and take into account mobile nodes with different communications capabilities, such as multiple radio interfaces.

[Regenerationist Usage of Water's Symbology Between Decaying Spa Resorts Movement and Kneippist Morals].,"At the end of the 19th century coexisted in Spain several therapies based on the use of water. Some of them were considered orthodox therapies, some were applied as unorthodox medicines, but all of them relied on the symbolism of water to obtain patients. From the point of view of the orthodoxy, the discourse of medical hydrology, thalassotherapy and hydrotherapy tended to exclude unscientific values. The naturist and kneippist movements, on the other hand, frequently used images of water (especially cold water) as a support for their regenerational projects, using both the material and the moral aspects. Therefore, Kneipp's therapy became a kind of Spanish interpretation of the social catholic reforming attitude.",1998,Dynamis
Cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory compounds from Red Sea grass Thalassodendron ciliatum,"Chemical investigation of the less polar fraction methylene dichlorideâ€“methanol extract of the Red Sea grass Thalassodendron ciliatum led to the isolation of a new phytoceramide molecular species TCC-1, along with four known compounds: 7Î²-hydroxy cholesterol (10), 7Î²-hydroxysitosterol (11), stigmasterol glucoside (12), and Î²-sitosterol glucoside (13). Phytosphingosines with 2-hydroxy fatty acid residues constituted the phytoceramide molecular species TCC-1. Further purification of TCC-1 afforded two new phytoceramides: TCC-1-5 (5) and TCC-1-7 (7) as well as the known ceramide TCC-1-6 (6). All compounds are reported for the first time from this genus. The chemical structures of the isolated compounds were clarified on the basis of spectroscopic techniques including IR, NMR experiments, mass spectrometry, and chemical methods, in addition to comparison with literature data.

Evidence-Based Nephrology: Efficacy of Hepatitis B Vaccine in Hemodialysis Patients,"patients and primary care physicians with numerous questions. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) enables the physicians to make explicit and judicious use of the best available evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients (1, 2). In adhering to EBM, a physician needs to follow 4 fundamental steps: 1) formulate a well balanced clinical question; 2) track down evidence with maximum efficiency; 3) critically appraise the information to determine validity; and 4) integrate the information in the care of individual patients. Without the ability to critically appraise clinical evidence, the practitioner is able to answer perhaps only 30% of these questions (1). When faced with the question: â€œIn a hemodialysis patient does intramuscular administration of hepatitis B vaccine confer a longer lasting seroprotectivity as compared to hepatit is B vaccine administered by intradermal route?â€, the recent article by Vlassopoulous et al (3) demonstrates effectively the ability of EBM to demystify the clinical relevance of the article. A term gaining importance in assessing therapy is the number needed to treat (NNT). It is defined as the number of patients needed to treat to achieve one favorable outcome (2, 4). NNT is calculated as 1/ absolute risk reduction. NNT is a better measure of clinical significance than relative risk reduction (RRR) and statistical significance (4). NNT helps the nephrologist avoid unnecessary therapy and refine oneâ€™s clinical decision making. Extrapolation of data presented in Figure 2 of the paper by Vlassopoulous et al (3) indicates that the seroprotection rates conferred by intramuscular administration of hepatitis B at 13 months, 24 months, 36 months and 48 months is 100%, 90%, 84%, and 90% respectively as compared with the intradermal hepatitis B vaccination seroprotective rates of 77%, 55%, 58% and 35% respectively (Tabl. I). I come up with the following numbers for the NNT presented in Table I. This data can be interpreted as; in a chronic hemodialysis patient administration of hepatit is B vaccination by intramuscular route as compared to intradermal route results in an absolute risk reduction of 55% at 4 years resulting in a NNT of 2. Stated in another manner every other patient who received intramuscular hepatit is B vaccination had clinically signif icant seroprotectivity as compared to patients treated with intradermal vaccination when compared at the end of 4 years! This is of clear cl inical importance to the nephrologist in being able to objectively quantify the importance of the study and explain the results of a new therapy to other physicians. Routine presentation of statistical as well as clinical significance of clinical data could greatly enhance the applicability of a study.",2000,The International Journal of Artificial Organs
"Systems genetics and genome-wide association approaches for analysis of feed intake, feed efficiency, and performance in beef cattle.","Feed intake, feed efficiency, and weight gain are important economic traits of beef cattle in feedlots. In the present study, we investigated the physiological processes underlying such traits from the point of view of systems genetics. Firstly, using data from 1334 Nellore (Bos indicus) cattle and 943,577 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a genome-wide association analysis was performed for dry matter intake, average daily weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and residual feed intake with a Bayesian Lasso procedure. Genes within 50-kb SNPs, most relevant for explaining the genomic variance, were annotated and the biological processes underlying the traits were inferred from Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Our results indicated several putative genomic regions associated with the target phenotypes and showed that almost all genomic variances were in the SNPs located in the intergenic and intronic regions. We further identified five main metabolic pathways related to ion transport, body composition, and feed intake control, which influenced the four phenotypes simultaneously. The systems genetics approach used in this study revealed novel pathways related to feed efficiency traits in beef cattle.",2016,Genetics and molecular research : GMR

[Ablation of familial atrial fibrillation. Favorable long-term outcome].,"We present the case of a 39-year-old man with no risk factors for cardiovascular disease. He had a 6-year history of paroxysmal atrial flutter and fibrillation, documented by electrocardiogram and Holter. He complained of daily episodes of rapid, irregular palpitation. There was no radiographic or echographic evidence of structural myocardial abnormalities. Other members of the family (a grandmother, his father, a brother and at least two uncles) had a history of atrial fibrillation that had begun at an early age (Figure). All of them had been diagnosed as having â€œisolatedâ€ atrial fibrillation. Our patient had been treated unsuccessfully with diltiazem, flecainide, and propafenone. An electrophysiological study revealed the presence of typical atrial flutter. Radiofrequency ablation was performed and the flutter was interrupted by bidirectional isthmus block. Treatment was continued with flecainide at a dose of 100 mg/12 h. During follow-up, multiple episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were detected, and ablation of the pulmonary veins was indicated. This procedure was performed with the patient in sinus rhythm. Two electrode catheters were introduced via right femoral vein and a third via subclavian vein. Double transseptal catheterization was successfully performed, and pulmonary vein potentials were recorded using a 4-mm Marinr ablation catheter (Medtronic) and a Lasso catheter (Cordis). The 4 pulmonary veins were isolated (power setting: 50 W, 65oC) and the left isthmus was ablated, although abnormal potentials were detected only in the left superior pulmonary vein. After a 30-month postablation follow-up period during which he received no antiarrhythmic therapy, the patient did not experience palpitations and the Holter recording was normal. Ablation of atrial fibrillation constitutes a real and effective therapeutic option in many patients with very frequent episodes that are refractory to antiarrhythmic therapy. Familial atrial fibrillation is a heterogeneous genetic disease that is an object of continuous research. Until now, the prospects for the treatment of these patients were limited. We report the case of a patient with atrial fibrillation that could have an autosomic dominant pattern of inheritance or could be the outcome of both parents having a recessive genetic disorder. Its penetrance is apparently high. Associated heart disease or precipitating factors were not encountered. Brugada et al reported several cases of familial atrial fibrillation and identified the gene responsible for this disorder on chromosome 10, although it is assumed that there are probably a number of genetic abnormalities involved. In a certain proportion of patients with atrial fibrillation, we were unable to identify the cardiac disorder or its causes. Many of these patients may present either a hereditary or a de novo genetic abnormality. Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation is progressively becoming accepted as an effective technique in the treatment of refractory patients. The keys to selecting the patient and the appropriate technique remain to be determined, as is the degree of efficacy in familial cases. The isolation of the pulmonary vein orifices makes it possible to eliminate the arrhythmogenic activity that triggers or perpetuates the arrhythmia without eliminating other possible foci. In our patient, we detected abnormal potentials only in the left superior pulmonary vein, although, given the characteristics of the case, we opted for the isolation of all 4 pulmonary veins and an additional line for left LETTERS TO THE EDITOR",2005,Revista espanola de cardiologia
Large-Scale Dynamic Predictive Regressions,"We develop a novel ""decouple-recouple"" dynamic predictive strategy and contribute to the literature on forecasting and economic decision making in a data-rich environment. Under this framework, clusters of predictors generate different latent states in the form of predictive densities that are later synthesized within an implied time-varying latent factor model. As a result, the latent inter-dependencies across predictive densities and biases are sequentially learned and corrected. Unlike sparse modeling and variable selection procedures, we do not assume a priori that there is a given subset of active predictors, which characterize the predictive density of a quantity of interest. We test our procedure by investigating the predictive content of a large set of financial ratios and macroeconomic variables on both the equity premium across different industries and the inflation rate in the U.S., two contexts of topical interest in finance and macroeconomics. We find that our predictive synthesis framework generates both statistically and economically significant out-of-sample benefits while maintaining interpretability of the forecasting variables. In addition, the main empirical results highlight that our proposed framework outperforms both LASSO-type shrinkage regressions, factor based dimension reduction, sequential variable selection, and equal-weighted linear pooling methodologies.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
"Hospital-Based Back Surgery: Geospatial-Temporal, Explanatory, and Predictive Models","BACKGROUND
Hospital-based back surgery in the United States increased by 60% from January 2012 to December 2017, yet the supply of neurosurgeons remained relatively constant. During this time, adult obesity grew by 5%.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to evaluate the demand and associated costs for hospital-based back surgery by geolocation over time to evaluate provider practice variation. The study then leveraged hierarchical time series to generate tight demand forecasts on an unobserved test set. Finally, explanatory financial, technical, workload, geographical, and temporal factors as well as state-level obesity rates were investigated as predictors for the demand for hospital-based back surgery.


METHODS
Hospital data from January 2012 to December 2017 were used to generate geospatial-temporal maps and a video of the Current Procedural Terminology codes beginning with the digit 63 claims. Hierarchical time series modeling provided forecasts for each state, the census regions, and the nation for an unobserved test set and then again for the out-years of 2018 and 2019. Stepwise regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, elastic net, and gradient-boosted random forests were built on a training set and evaluated on a test set to evaluate variables important to explaining the demand for hospital-based back surgery.


RESULTS
Widespread, unexplained practice variation over time was seen using geographical information systems (GIS) multimedia mapping. Hierarchical time series provided accurate forecasts on a blind dataset and suggested a 6.52% (from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 529,777 in 2018) growth of hospital-based back surgery in 2018 (529,777 and up to 13.00% by 2019 [from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 563,023 procedures in 2019]). The increase in payments by 2019 are estimated to be US $323.9 million. Extreme gradient-boosted random forests beat constrained and unconstrained regression models on a 20% unobserved test set and suggested that obesity is one of the most important factors in explaining the increase in demand for hospital-based back surgery.


CONCLUSIONS
Practice variation and obesity are factors to consider when estimating demand for hospital-based back surgery. Federal, state, and local planners should evaluate demand-side and supply-side interventions for this emerging problem.",2019,Journal of Medical Internet Research
Pollen Analysis of the Cretaceous Sediments in Taiwan,"Fifty eight form genera, one hundred and thirty four form species of fossil palynomorphs were reported from the early Cretaceous strata based on materials from seventeen exploration wells in Taiwan. Among these, there are fourty-five form genera and ninety eight form species of pteridophytic spores, eleven form genera and twenty six form species of gymnospermous grains, and two form genera and ten form species of angiospermous grains and one form genus and one form species of algal spores. These early Cretaceous palynomorphic assemblages are predominated by gymnosperms in species quantity but by pteridophytes in species diversity. Angiospermous species are only represented by primitive monocolpate and tricolpate pollen grains. The flora assemblages of the early Cretaceous of Taiwan might suggest a tropical to subtropical climate at that time and the plant community was dominated by coastal scrub plants such as Classopollis. More landwards, the flora was replaced by pteridophytic Cyatheaceae and gymnospermous Classopollis savanna plants in which local pteridophytic grassland was also common.",1995,
Is the amount of algae related to territorial defense and reproductive success in the beaugregory damselfish,"The species and quantity of algae growing in the territories of male beaugregory damselfish (Stegastes leucostictus) were compared to the defendersâ€™ aggression and relative reproductive success. To offset major habitat differences among territories, males were given identical artificial breeding sites in January 1982. The amount of algae growing on the sites, the defense levels against common intruding species of fish, and the malesâ€™ reproductive success were assessed during the summer of 1982. The intensity of a defender's territorial defense was estimated by the frequency of his attacks against a fish housed in a clear jar placed within his territory. The total amount of algae was significantly correlated with estimates of reproductive success, and also with its territorial defense against one of the three fish tested (the herbivorous striped parrotfish, Scarus iserti, not the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, and the conspecific male). In addition to the effects of total algal biomass, effects o...",1994,
Sedimentology of Palynomorphs and Palynodebris in Cretaceous Carbonaceous Facies South of Vigo Seamount,"Palynological study of 94 samples representing the late Hauterivian-Cenomanian carbonaceous section at Site 398, DSDPIPOD Leg 47B, revealed major fluctuations in the abundance and distribution of palynomorphs. Three palynofacies were distinguished, based on the distribution of palynomorphs and palynodebris. The exinitic palynofacies is characterized by numerous specimens and species of sporomorphs to the almost total exclusion of dinoflagellate cysts and small acritarchs, and by structured palynodebris such as vascular plant cuticle and tracheids. It is considered to have been emplaced during times of high rates of sedimentation of land plant materials contributed from actively prograding deltas. The micrinitic palynofacies is characterized by abundant amorphous palynodebris in the form of small, apparently carbonized, opaque or semi-opaque carbonaceous particles and a palynoflora composed of fewer specimens dominated by Classopollis, bisaccates, and dinoflagellates. It represents the much diminished sedimentation of terrigenous vegetal materials, and was deposited by marine currents which concentrated those sporomorph types morphologically adapted for selective transportation. The xenomorphic palynofacies contains a palynoflora similar to that of the micrinitic fades, but is distinquished by an abundance of amorphous palynodebris composed of optically translucent particles which show safranin stain well. Palynomorphs may be rare or abundant in this facies. The close correspondence between the sporomorph abundance and organic carbon curves indicates that the organic carbon composition of the more carbonaceous intervals of the investigated section is terrigenous and derived from land plants. The smaller carbonaceous content of the micrinitic facies may be the result of the much smaller contribution of land plant materials. The lack of a direct correspondence between the sporomorph assemblages and organic carbon composition in the xenomorphic facies suggests that factors other than, or additional to, the sedimentation of terrigenous plant materials were responsible for the carbonaceous composition of these sediments.",1979,

â€žEngineeringâ€ error evaluation in approximate structural analysis,"SommarioSi considerano gli errori introdotti nel calcolo delle strutture dall'uso di metodi approssimati. Si osserva che stime di errore puramente matematiche possono essere insufficienti a giudicare l'efficienza del metodo adottato e l'applicabilitÃ  dei risultati. Questa circostanza puÃ² derivare dalla presenza di molti altri fattori di incertezza che, comportando l'applicazione di uno o piÃ¹ coefficienti di sicurezza, tendono a riassorbire, almeno parzialmente, l'influenza degli errori di calcolo sull'affidabilitÃ  delle strutture.Per tenere conto di questo effetto, si propone una definizione di errore strettamente legata alla nozione di Â«ProbabilitÃ  di collassoÂ» (in senso lato) della struttura. Si tenta pertanto di valutare l'Â«errore in sicurezzaÂ» nel contesto della teoria della affidabilitÃ . Infine si esplorano alcune possibili applicazioni e si discutono i risultati ottenuti.SummaryIt is observed that pure mathematical estimates of errors involved by the introduction of approximate procedures in structural analysis may be insufficient to judge the effectiveness of the method and the adequacy of the results. This circumstance can be explained by the simultaneous presence of many other uncertainties that, making necessary the application of one or more safety coefficients, tend to adsorb, at least partially, the influence of wrong calculations on structure reliability.To take this effect into account, a definition of Â«errorÂ» is proposed, that is strictly related to the concept of Â«failure probabilityÂ» (in the wide sense) of the structure. Next, an attempt is made to evaluate the Â«error on safetyÂ», in the context of the Reliability Theory. Finally, possible applications are investigated, and the results are discussed.",1980,Meccanica
Novel Hybrid Method for Gene Selection and Cancer Prediction,"Microarray data profiles gene expression on a whole genome scale, therefore, it provides a good way to study associations between gene expression and occurrence or progression of cancer. More and more researchers realized that microarray data is helpful to predict cancer sample. However, the high dimension of gene expressions is much larger than the sample size, which makes this task very difficult. Therefore, how to identify the significant genes causing cancer becomes emergency and also a hot and hard research topic. Many feature selection algorithms have been proposed in the past focusing on improving cancer predictive accuracy at the expense of ignoring the correlations between the features. In this work, a novel framework (named by SGS) is presented for stable gene selection and efficient cancer prediction . The proposed framework first performs clustering algorithm to find the gene groups where genes in each group have higher correlation coefficient, and then selects the significant genes in each group with Bayesian Lasso and important gene groups with group Lasso, and finally builds prediction model based on the shrinkage gene space with efficient classification algorithm (such as, SVM, 1NN, Regression and etc.). Experiment results on real world data show that the proposed framework often outperforms the existing feature selection and prediction methods, say SAM, IG and Lasso-type prediction model.

Using Machine Learning to Construct Nomograms for Patients with Metastatic Colon Cancer.,"AIM
Patients with synchronous colon cancer metastases have highly variable overall survival (OS), making accurate predictive models challenging to build. We aim to use machine learning to more accurately predict OS in these patients and to present this predictive model in the form of nomograms for patients and clinicians.


METHODS
Using the National Cancer Database (2010-2014), we identified right colon (RC) and left colon (LC) cancer patients with synchronous metastases. Each primary site was split into training and testing datasets. Nomograms predicting 3-year overall survival were created for each site using Cox proportional hazard regression with lasso regression. Each model was evaluated by both calibration (comparison of predicted versus observed overall survival) and validation (degree of concordance as measured by c-index) methodologies.


RESULTS
A total of 11,018 RC and 8,346 LC patients were used to construct and validate the nomograms. After stratifying each model into 5 risk groups, the predicted OS was within the 95% CI of the observed OS in 4 out of 5 risk groups for both the RC and LC models. Externally validated c-indexes at 3 years for RC and LC models were 0.794 and 0.761, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
Utilization of machine learning can result in more accurate predictive models for patients with metastatic colon cancer. Nomograms built from these models can assist clinicians and patients in the shared decision-making process of their cancer care.",2020,Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland
Throwing a Ã¢TynzyanÃ¢ Lasso at a Ã¢KhoreyÃ¢ pole as an element of physical initiation of boys in the modern culture of the northern peoples,The article describes a traditional sport of the people of the Russian North â€“ throwing a lasso (tynzyan) at a special wooden pole (khorey). This physical activity plays an important role in the culture of the northern people because it demonstrates attainment of skills and abilities which are important for the working life of the reindeer herders of the Far North. Proof of mastering the techniques of throwing a tynzyan at a khorey is one of the elements of the initiation ritual for boys of different ages in the traditional cultures of many native Northern people. In modern culture it is a major part of the sports of the Northern polyathlon where it retains its traditional cultural value of physical initiation of young men.,2016,
"Chemometric technique performances in predicting forest soil chemical and biological properties from UV-Vis-NIR reflectance spectra with small, high dimensional datasets","Abstract: Chemometric analysis applied to diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is increasingly proposed as an effective and accurate methodology to predict soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Its effectiveness, however, largely varies in relation to the calibration techniques and the specific soil properties. In addition, the calibration of UV-Vis-NIR spectra usually requires large datasets, and the identification of techniques suitable to deal with small sample sizes and high dimensionality problems is a primary challenge. In order to investigate the predictability of many soil chemical and biological properties from a small dataset and to identify the most suitable techniques to deal with this type of problems, we analysed 20 top soil samples of three different forests (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus cerris and Quercus ilex) in southern Apennines (Italy). Diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded in the UV-Vis-NIR range (200-2500 nm) and 22 chemical and biological properties were analysed. Three different calibration techniques were tested, namely the Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), the combinations wavelet transformation/Elastic net and wavelet transformation/Supervised Principal Component (SPC) regression/ Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), a kind of preconditioned LASSO. Calibration techniques were applied to both raw spectra and spectra subjected to wavelet shrinkage filtering, in order to evaluate the influence on predictions of spectra denoising. Overall, SPC/LASSO outperformed the other techniques with both raw and denoised spectra. Elastic net produced heterogeneous results, but outperformed SPC/LASSO for total organic carbon, whereas PLSR produced the worst results. Spectra denoising improved the prediction accuracy of many parameters, but worsen the predictions in some cases. Our approach highlighted that: (i) SPC/LASSO (and Elastic net in the case of total organic carbon) is especially suitable to calibrate spectra in the case of small, high dimensional datasets; and (ii) spectra denoising could be an effective technique to improve calibration results.",2016,Iforest - Biogeosciences and Forestry
Assessment of Weighted Quantile Sum Regression for Modeling Chemical Mixtures and Cancer Risk,"In evaluation of cancer risk related to environmental chemical exposures, the effect of many chemicals on disease is ultimately of interest. However, because of potentially strong correlations among chemicals that occur together, traditional regression methods suffer from collinearity effects, including regression coefficient sign reversal and variance inflation. In addition, penalized regression methods designed to remediate collinearity may have limitations in selecting the truly bad actors among many correlated components. The recently proposed method of weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression attempts to overcome these problems by estimating a body burden index, which identifies important chemicals in a mixture of correlated environmental chemicals. Our focus was on assessing through simulation studies the accuracy of WQS regression in detecting subsets of chemicals associated with health outcomes (binary and continuous) in site-specific analyses and in non-site-specific analyses. We also evaluated the performance of the penalized regression methods of lasso, adaptive lasso, and elastic net in correctly classifying chemicals as bad actors or unrelated to the outcome. We based the simulation study on data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program (NCI-SEER) case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) to achieve realistic exposure situations. Our results showed that WQS regression had good sensitivity and specificity across a variety of conditions considered in this study. The shrinkage methods had a tendency to incorrectly identify a large number of components, especially in the case of strong association with the outcome.",2015,Cancer Informatics
The generalization performance of kernelized elastic net regularization based on exponentially strongly mixing observations,"The study of kernelized elastic net regularization (KENReg) is a promising topic in machine learning community. Different from the elastic net regularizer in Zou and Hastie [1] which focuses on selecting group and correlated features, KENReg aims at obtaining a sparse and stable approximation to the regression function. In terms of generalization, sparseness and stability, KENReg performs better than kernelized Lasso, we are concerned about the generalization performance of KENReg in this paper. For the purpose of this paper is to study the generalization ability of KENReg for the dependent samples, and the dependent samples we choose are exponentially strongly mixing sequence. So as to study the generalization ability of KENReg for exponentially strongly mixing samples, we first use the stepping-stone technique proposed in Wu and Zhou [2], then we shown the generalization bounds of KENReg based on exponentially strongly mixing samples, and finally we make the results more accurate with uniformly ergodic Markov chains (u.e.M.c.) samples.",2017,"2017 13th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)"
Calibration d'algorithmes de type Lasso et analyse statistique de donnÃ©es mÃ©tallurgiques en aÃ©ronautique,"Notre these comprend deux parties : lâ€™une methodologique, lâ€™autre appliquee.La partie methodologique porte sur le Lasso et une variante de cet algorithme, le Lasso projete, en vue de leur calibration par pente.

Pour determiner la forme de la penalite et la valeur de la constante, nous adaptons les approches classiques de Birge et Massart. Ceci permet de degager la notion de penalite canonique.

Distributed Lasso for in-network linear regression,"The least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) is a popular tool for joint estimation and continuous variable selection, especially well-suited for the under-determined but sparse linear regression problems. This paper develops an algorithm to estimate the regression coefficients via Lasso when the training data is distributed across different agents, and their communication to a central processing unit is prohibited for e.g., communication cost or privacy reasons. The novel distributed algorithm is obtained after reformulating the Lasso into a separable form, which is iteratively minimized using the alternating-direction method of multipliers so as to gain the desired degree of parallelization. The per agent estimate updates are given by simple soft-thresholding operations, and inter-agent communication overhead remains at affordable level. Without exchanging elements from the different training sets, the local estimates provably consent to the global Lasso solution, i.e., the fit that would be obtained if the entire data set were centrally available. Numerical experiments corroborate the convergence and global optimality of the proposed distributed scheme.",2010,"2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing"
Oltre Bernardino piffaro: strumentisti a fiato alla corte di Mantova tra XV e XVI secolo,"As was common in the 16th-century European courts, the GonzagasÂ of Mantua exploited musicians in order to strengthen the image of their nobilityÂ and power. Wind instruments played a significant role within this context and theÂ player Bernardino Piffaro, highly respected for both his technical skills and personalÂ qualities, constitutes the most notable figure. Besides, it is also worth noting theÂ reliability and confidence that the aristocrats placed on these musicians by entrustingÂ them with various types of assignments which often included diplomatic ones. This was e.g. the case of the so-called â€œtrombettiâ€, testifying, due to the delicateÂ and complex nature of the tasks they were entrusted with, their necessity to possessÂ not only musical qualities, but also a certain cultural background and excellentÂ dialectical skills. The article will focus on these musiciansâ€™ peculiar biographies andÂ features during the period spanning from the 1580s to the beginning of the followingÂ century. The results here presented cannot be considered complete and definitive,Â mostly because the musicians were numerous and constantly on the move;Â however, it is possible to acquire a broader view of many aspects of their lives,Â from both a musical and personal point of view.

The scalable Birth-Death MCMC Algorithm for Mixed Graphical Model Learning with Application to Genomic Data Integration,"Recent advances in biological research have seen the emergence of high-throughput technologies with numerous applications that allow the study of biological mechanisms at an unprecedented depth and scale. A large amount of genomic data is now distributed through consortia like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), where specific types of biological information on specific type of tissue or cell are available. In cancer research, the challenge is now to perform integrative analyses of high-dimensional multi-omic data with the goal to better understand genomic processes that correlate with cancer outcomes, e.g. elucidate gene networks that discriminate a specific cancer subgroups (cancer sub-typing) or discovering gene networks that overlap across different cancer types (pan-cancer studies). In this paper, we propose a novel mixed graphical model approach to analyze multi-omic data of different types (continuous, discrete and count) and perform model selection by extending the Birth-Death MCMC (BDMCMC) algorithm initially proposed by Stephens (2000) and later developed by Mohammadi and Wit (2015). We compare the performance of our method to the LASSO method and the standard BDMCMC method using simulations and find that our method is superior in terms of both computational efficiency and the accuracy of the model selection results. Finally, an application to the TCGA breast cancer data shows that integrating genomic information at different levels (mutation and expression data) leads to better subtyping of breast cancers.",2020,
High dimensional QSAR study of mild steel corrosion inhibition in acidic medium by furan derivatives,"The inhibition of mild steel corrosion in 1 M HCl by 17 furan derivatives was investigated experimentally using potentiodynamic polarization measurements. The furan derivatives inhibit the mild steel corrosion. The experimental inhibition efficiency (IE) was used in a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) study. Dragon software was used to calculate the molecular descriptors. Penalized multiple linear regression (PMLR) was applied as a variable selection method using three penalties namely, ridge, LASSO, and elastic net. A number of 8 and 38 significant molecular descriptors were selected by LASSO and elastic net methods, respectively. The most significant descriptors namely, PJI3, P_VSA_s_4, Mor16u, MATS3p, and PDI were selected by both LASSO and elastic net methods. The elastic net results show low mean-squared error of the training set (MSEtrain) of 0.0004 and test set (MSEtest) of 5.332. The results confirm that the penalized multiple linear regression based on elastic net penalty is the most effective method to deal with high dimensional data",2015,International Journal of Electrochemical Science
Storia Della Mineralogia Antica. I. La Mineralogia A Bisanzio Nel Xi Secolo D.C.: I Poteri Insiti Nelle Pietre Secondo Michele Psello,"A new, full Italian translation is given of Michael Psellusâ€™ Â«On the powers of stonesÂ». This short text is cosidered to be the testimony of all knowledge on minerals surviving at Byzantium during the second half of 11th century, as it draws information from much older scientific texts, such as Xenocrates of Ephesusâ€™Lithognomon and Dioscorides of Anazarbaâ€™s Â«On medical matterÂ», both written ca. 50â€“70 AD and summarized by the elder Pliny in his mighty encyclopedia. The former treatise did not reach us but for quotations by Latin, Greek and Arab writers; by contrast, the latter one is still existant, as it was used as the textbook on pharmacology in most European universities till well into the 17th century. Psellus briefly summarizes information on 24 stones he claims to be experienced of, and adds of his own only a few suggestions on their beneficial powers. His recipes are still free of the alchemical magics typically imbuing contemporaneous Arabic science, and recall some dubious therapeutical practices that Graeco-roman medical science had inherited from Chaldean and Egyptian experience. There is nothing added of the Christian tradition attached to stones. Therefore, Psellusâ€™ text actually uncovers the state of art of mineral understanding at the end of the Â«rationalisticÂ» phase of Byzantine Renaissance (843â€“1025)i.e., just a few decades before most if not all sound Greek scientific tradition was lost under the ruin of the Byzantine civilisation that followed the conquest of the city by the crusaders (1204). Moreover, Psellusâ€™ work helps clarifying the role that Greek texts had in the development of mineral studies in medieval western Europe, before the entry of Arabic science which prompted its independent scientific revolution.RiassuntoSulla base di una nuova traduzione direttamente dal greco dellâ€™operetta di Michele Psello Â«Sulle proprietÃ  delle pietreÂ», ed inoltre di informazioni sullâ€™autore e dello studio sulle sue fonti, Ã¨ valutato lo stato di sviluppo delle scienze mineralogiche a Costantinopoli alla fine del XI secolo d.C., al termine della grande stagione della Rinascenza Bizantina (843â€“1025) e prima del definitivo collasso della civiltÃ  bizantina conseguente alla quarta crociata (1204). Per quanto rimasto incompleto (quasi un abbozzo), il trattato di Psello dimostra che in quel periodo le nozioni sui minerali si rifacevano ancora alle conoscenze empiriche accumulate dagli scienziati ellenistici, fondandosi in particolare su compilazioni del periodo greco-romano come ilLithognomon di Senocrate da Efeso, scritto allâ€™inizio dellâ€™era volgare. Queste nozioni erano giÃ  in larga parte note anche nellâ€™Europa occidentale per effetto della riduzione in latino dellâ€™opera di Senocrate eseguita da Plinio il Vecchio. Esse erano integrate a Bisanzio con credenze sullâ€™efficacia dei poteri terapeutici delle pietre rifacentisi non tanto alDe materia medica di Dioscoride dâ€™Anazarba, pure scritto allâ€™inizio dellâ€™era volgare, quanto piuttosto a superstizioni tra mediche e magiche ereditate da autori mediorientali ed egiziani dâ€™Ã©tÃ  greco-romana, che avevano proposto lâ€™utilizzo delle pietre per prevenire e proteggere dai malanni, oltre che per il loro benefico influsso astrale. Mancano evidenze di significativi influssi della tradizione mistica giudeo-cristiana relativa alle pietre bibliche e non câ€™Ã¨ neppure traccia della magia alchemica, che svilupperÃ  invece la sua influenza sulla Mineralogia europea a partire dalle traduzioni dallâ€™arabo e continuerÃ  a mantenerla sensibile per vari secoli a venire, fino a quando lâ€™Occidente di lingua latina sarÃ  maturato al punto da essere in grado di esprimere la sua propria rivoluzione scientifica.",2005,Rendiconti Lincei
Denoising and decomposition of moment sequences using convex optimization,"Many high dimensional phenomena observed in applications are simple and can be approximated by a small combination of a potentially infinite number of building blocks or atoms. It is possible to estimate such simple objects robustly from a limited number of noisy measurements. Atomic norm regularization proposed in this thesis is a convex optimization problem that can be used for deriving efficient estimators of such high dimensional structures in a large number of cases. 
This thesis provides a general approach to regularization using an atomic norm penalty which unifies previous literature on high dimensional statistics. We will revisit two fundamental problems in signal processing and systems theory â€” line spectral estimation and system identification, which are classically treated as nonlinear parameter estimation problems. We will see that the convex approach proposed in this thesis can provide a principled way of tackling these problems and provide optimal theoretical guarantees in the presence of noise. In contrast, parametric approaches often need to estimate the number of atoms or the model order and need heuristics to robustly nonlinear estimation. 
The approach in this thesis can be thought of as a generalization of the Lasso estimator for handling continuous infinite dimensional sparse recovery problems. For the problem of line spectral estimation, I will provide efficient algorithms based on an exact semidefinite characterization of the proposed estimator and also more generally show that discretization provides a scalable alternative to approximate the solution for a number of problems.",2013,
Variable Selection with Spatially Autoregressive Errors: A Generalized Moments LASSO Estimator,"We propose generalized moments LASSO estimator, combining LASSO with GMM, for penalized variable selection and estimation under the spatial error model with spatially autoregressive errors. We establish parameter consistency and selection sign consistency of the proposed estimator in the low dimensional setting when the parameter dimension p < sample size n , as well as the high dimensional setting with p greater than and growing with n. Finite sample performance of the method is examined by simulation, compared against the LASSO for IID data. The methods are applied to estimation of a spatial Durbin model for the Aveiro housing market (Portugal).",2019,
Regularized approach for data missing not at random,"It is common in longitudinal studies that missing data occur due to subjectsâ€™ no response, missed visits, dropout, death or other reasons during the course of study. To perform valid analysis in this setting, data missing not at random (MNAR) have to be considered. However, models for data MNAR often suffer from the identifiability issue and hence result in difficulty in estimation and computational convergence. To ameliorate this issue, we propose the LASSO and ridge-regularized selection models that regularize the missing data mechanism model to handle data MNAR, with the regularization parameter selected via a cross-validation procedure. The proposed models can be also employed for sensitivity analysis to examine the effects on inference of different assumptions about the missing data mechanism. We illustrate the performance of the proposed models via simulation studies and the analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial.",2019,Statistical Methods in Medical Research
"Southern Stingray, Dasyatis americana: Host for a Symbiotic Cleaner Wrasse","The southern stingray, Dasyatis americana, served as host for the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, in a symbiotic cleaning relationship at a site near Bimini, Bahamas. Rays were cleaned either while swimming slowly around a cleaning station or when they settled to the bottom and assumed a peculiar, stereotyped pose. Cleaning bouts lasted from less than a minute to 26 min. Both sexes of rays were cleaned and one individual was cleaned four times over 2 d. A trematode ectoparasite was found on the stingrays, but they were not heavily infested and only occasionally had wounds.",1990,Copeia
Presenting logistic regression-based landslide susceptibility results,"Abstract A new work-flow is proposed to unify the way the community shares Logistic Regression results for landslide susceptibility purposes. Although Logistic Regression models and methods have been widely used in geomorphology for several decades, no standards for presenting results in a consistent way have been adopted; most papers report parameters with different units and interpretations, therefore limiting potential meta-analytic applications. We first summarize the major differences in the geomorphological literature and then investigate each one proposing current best practices and few methodological developments. The latter is mainly represented by a widely used approach in statistics for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection in generalized linear models, namely the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO). The North-easternmost sector of Sicily (Italy) is chosen as a straightforward example with well exposed debris flows induced by extreme rainfall.",2018,Engineering Geology
Effects of habitat modification on coastal fish assemblages.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of anthropogenic modification of coastal habitats on fish assemblages in Taiwan, comparing the abundance, species richness and taxonomic composition of fishes on natural v. artificial habitats. While there was no significant variation in the abundance or richness of fishes between natural and artificial habitats, the species composition of fishes in artificial habitats was significantly different from that of natural habitats. Natural reefs were characterized by greater abundance of Stethojulis spp. (Labridae), Abudefduf spp. (Pomacentridae) and Thalassoma spp. (Labridae), whereas anthropogenic habitats were dominated by Parupeneus indicus (Mullidae), Pempheris oualensis (Pempheridae) and Parapriacanthus ransonneti (Pempheridae). In general, it appears that specialist reef-associated species are being replaced with fishes that are much more generalist in their habitat-use. The loss of natural coastal habitats may threaten some species that cannot live in anthropogenically altered habitats, though the overall abundance and diversity of coastal fishes was not significantly different between natural and artificial habitats in Taiwan.",2010,Journal of fish biology
Using Kinect for Facial Expression Recognition under Varying Poses and Illumination,"Emotions analysis and recognition by the smartphones with front cameras is a relatively new concept. In this paper we present an algorithm that uses a low resolution 3D sensor for facial expression recognition. The 3D head pose as well as 3D location of the fiducial points are determined using Face Tracking SDK. Tens of the features are automatically selected from a pool determined by all possible line segments between such facial landmarks. We compared correctly classified ratios using features selected by AdaBoost, Lasso and histogram-based algorithms. We compared the classification accuracies obtained both on 3D maps and RGB images. Our results justify the feasibility of low accuracy 3D sensing devices for facial emotion recognition.",2014,
Metabolome-based discrimination of chrysanthemum cultivars for the efficient generation of flower color variations in mutation breeding,"The color variations of ornamental flowers are often generated by ion-beam and gamma irradiation mutagenesis. However, mutation rates differ significantly even among cultivars of the same species, resulting in high cost and intensive labor for flower color breeding. We aimed to establish a metabolome-based strategy to identify biomarkers and select promising parental lines with high mutation rates using Chrysanthemum as the case study. The mutation rates associated with flower color were measured in 10 chrysanthemum cultivars with pink, yellow, or white flowers after soft X-ray irradiation at the floret-formation stage. The metabolic profiles of the petals of these cultivars were clarified by widely targeted metabolomics and targeted carotenoid analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. Metabolome and carotenoid data were subjected to an un-supervised principal component analysis (PCA) and a supervised logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The PCA of the metabolic profile data separated chrysanthemum cultivars according to flower color rather than mutation rates. By contrast, logistic regression with LASSO generated a discrimination model to separate cultivars into two groups with high or low mutation rates, and selected 11 metabolites associated with mutation rates that can be biomarkers candidates for selecting parental lines for mutagenesis. This metabolome-based strategy to identify metabolite markers for mutation rates associated with flower color might be applied to other ornamental flowers to accelerate mutation breeding for generating new cultivars with a wider range of flower colors.",2019,Metabolomics
Robust learning of discriminative projection for multicategory classification on the Stiefel manifold,"Learning a robust projection with a small number of training samples is still a challenging problem in face recognition, especially when the unseen faces have extreme variation in pose, illumination, and facial expression. To address this problem, we propose a framework formulated under statistical learning theory that facilitates robust learning of a discriminative projection. Dimensionality reduction using the projection matrix is combined with a linear classifier in the regularized framework of lasso regression. The projection matrix in conjunction with the classifier parameters are then found by solving an optimization problem over the Stiefel manifold. The experimental results on standard face databases suggest that the proposed method outperforms some recent regularized techniques when the number of training samples is small.",2008,2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
Systematic analysis of the caridean shrimp superfamily Pandaloidea (Crustacea: Decapoda) based on molecular and morphological evidence.,"One of the systematically controversial superfamilies in Caridea is the predominately deep-sea or cold water Pandaloidea, largely because this species-rich group of nearly 200 species in 25 genera exhibits a very high diversity of body forms and ecology. Although the relationships amongst the taxa within Pandaloidea have been repeatedly discussed based on morphology, no comprehensive molecular phylogeny exists. In this study, we present the first molecular phylogeny of the group, based on a combined dataset of two mitochondrial (12S and 16S rRNA) and six nuclear (ATP synthase Î²-subunit, enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, histone 3, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and sodium-potassium ATPase Î±-subunit) markers, based on 62 species (about 1/3 of known biodiversity) in 22 genera (88% of genera) of two pandaloid families (Pandalidae, Thalassocarididae) and outgroups from seven other caridean families. With generally high support, the relationships within the clade are fully resolved. Pandalidae is shown to be paraphyletic with Thalassocarididae deeply nested within as a monophyletic group, and the latter is herein considered to be a synonym of Pandalidae. Five major clades are recovered, with the shallow water genera Anachlorocurtis, Chlorocurtis, Chlorotocella and Miropandalus forming a sister clade to the remaining genera. At the genus level, the phylogeny indicates Plesionika, Heterocarpus and Pandalus to be not monophyletic. The validity of Pandalopsis, Stylopandalus and Calipandalus is challenged and these genera are considered herein to be junior synonyms of Pandalus (Pandalopsis) and Plesionika (Stylopandalus and Calipandalus). Although not fully resolved, some evidence potentially considers Nothocaris to be a valid genus. Ancestral State Reconstruction successfully recovered 15 synapomorphies for the major clades, with 11 of them reported to be of systematic significance for the first time.",2019,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution
Is Random Forest a Superior Methodology for Predicting Poverty? An Empirical Assessment,"Random forest is in many fields of research a common method for data driven predictions. Within economics and prediction of poverty, random forest is rarely used. Comparing out-of-sample predictions in surveys for same year in six countries shows that random forest is often more accurate than current common practice (multiple imputations with variables selected by stepwise and Lasso), suggesting that this method could contribute to better poverty predictions. However, none of the methods consistently provides accurate predictions of poverty over time, highlighting that technical model fitting by any method within a single year is not always, by itself, sufficient for accurate predictions of poverty over time.",2016,Poverty & Public Policy
Learning â„“1-penalized logistic regressions with smooth approximation,"The paper presents comparison of learning logistic regression model with different penalty terms. Main part of the paper concerns sparse regression, which includes absolute value function. This function is not strictly convex, thus common optimizers cannot be used directly. In the paper we show that in those cases smooth approximation of absolute value function can be effectively used either in the case of lasso regression or in fussed-lasso like case. One of examples focuses on two dimensional analogue of fussed-lasso model. The experimental results present the comparison of our implementations (in C++ and Python) on three benchmark datasets.",2017,2017 IEEE International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)
On the convergence of stochastic primal-dual hybrid gradient,"In this paper, we analyze the recently proposed stochastic primal-dual hybrid gradient (SPDHG) algorithm and provide new theoretical results. In particular, we prove almost sure convergence of the iterates to a solution and linear convergence with standard step sizes, independent of strong convexity constants. Our assumption for linear convergence is metric subregularity, which is satisfied for smooth and strongly convex problems in addition to many nonsmooth and/or nonstrongly convex problems, such as linear programs, Lasso, and support vector machines. In the general convex case, we prove optimal sublinear rates for the ergodic sequence and for randomly selected iterate, without bounded domain assumptions. We also provide numerical evidence showing that SPDHG with standard step sizes shows favorable and robust practical performance against its specialized strongly convex variant SPDHG-$\mu$ and other state-of-the-art algorithms including variance reduction methods and stochastic dual coordinate ascent.",2019,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Employing Quantitative Systems Pharmacology to Characterize Differences in Igf1 and Insulin Signaling Pathways in Breast Cancer,"Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) have been shown to influence cancer risk and progression through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, new insights on the mechanisms of differential MAPK and Akt activation are revealed by an iterative quantitative systems pharmacology approach. In the first iteration, I combined proteomic screening with computational network inference to uncover differences in IGF1 and insulin induced signaling. Using reverse phase protein array of 21 breast cancer cell lines treated with a time course of IGF1 and insulin, I constructed directed protein expression networks using three separate methods: (i) lasso regression, (ii) conventional matrix inversion, and (iii) entropy maximization. These networks, named here as the time translation models, were analyzed and the inferred interactions were ranked by differential magnitude to identify pathway differences. The two top candidates, chosen for experimental validation, were shown to regulate IGF1/insulin induced phosphorylation events. Both of the knock-down perturbations caused phosphorylation responses stronger in IGF1 stimulated cells compared with insulin. Overall, the time-translation modeling coupled to wet-lab experiments has proven to be powerful in inferring differential interactions downstream of IGF1 and insulin signaling, in vitro. In the second iteration, mechanistic representation of IGF1 and insulin dual signaling cascades by a set of ODEs is generated by rule-based modeling. The mechanistic network modeling provided a framework to elucidate experimental targets downstream of two receptors, which were treated as indistinguishable in previous models. The model included cascades of both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt signaling, as well as the crosstalk and feedback loops in between. The parameter perturbation scanning employed for seven different models of seven cell lines yielded new experimental hypotheses on how differential responses of MAPK and Akt originate. Complementary to the first iteration, the results in this part suggested that regulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is critical in inducing differential MAPK or Akt activation. Compensation and activating feedback mechanisms collectively depressed the efficacy of anti-IGF1R/InsR therapies. With the quantitative systems pharmacologic approach, the networks of signal transduction constructed in this thesis are aimed to discern novel downstream components of the IGF1R/InsR system, and to direct patients with suitable tumor subclasses to efficient personalized clinical interventions.",2018,
CORPORATEHEDGING IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY: THE USE OF FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES By U.S. lNSURERS J.David,"In this paper we investigate the extent to which insurance companies utilize financial derivatives contracts in the management of risks.The data set we employ allows us to observe the universe of individual insurer transactions for a classof contracts, namely, those normally thought of as offbalance-sheet (OBS). We provide information on the number of insurers using various types of derivatives contracts and the volume of transactions in terms of notional amounts and the number of counterparties. Life insurers are most active in interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, while property/casualty insurers tend to be active in trading equity option and foreign exchange contracts. Using a multivariate probit analysis,we explore the factors that potentially influence the existence of OBS activities. We also investigate questions relating to whether certain subsets of OBS transactions (for example, exchange traded) are related to such things as interest rate risk measures, organizational form and other characteristics that may discriminate between desired risk/return profiles across a cross-section of insurers. We find evidence consistent with the use of derivatives by insurers to hedge risksposed by guaranteed investment contracts (GICS), collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOS), and other sources of financial risk.",1998,
Fault Detection of Anti-friction Bearing using Ensemble Machine Learning Methods,"Anti-Friction Bearing (AFB) is a very important machine component and its unscheduled failure leads to cause of malfunction in wide range of rotating machinery which results in unexpected downtime and economic loss. In this paper, ensemble machine learning techniques are demonstrated for the detection of different AFB faults. Initially, statistical features were extracted from temporal vibration signals and are collected using experimental test rig for different input parameters like load, speed and bearing conditions. These features are ranked using two techniques, namely Decision Tree (DT) and Randomized Lasso (R Lasso), which are further used to form training and testing input feature sets to machine learning techniques.Â  It uses three ensemble machine learning techniques for AFB fault classification namely Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) and Extra Tree Classifier (ETC). The impact of number of ranked features and estimators have been studied for ensemble techniques. The result showed that the classification efficiency is significantly influenced by the number of features but the effect of number of estimators is minor. The demonstrated ensemble techniques give more accuracy in classification as compared to tuned SVM with same experimental input data. The highest AFB fault classification accuracy 98% is obtained with ETC and DT feature ranking.",2018,"International Journal of Engineering, Transactions B: Applications"
"Acritarch assemblages from the Oville and Barrios Formations, northern Spain: A pilot proposal of a middle Cambrian (Series 3) acritarch biozonation in northwestern Gondwana","Abstract This paper presents a re-study of acritarchs from the Cambrian Oville and Barrios Formations in the Cantabrian Zone, northern Spain. The excellent preservation of the acritarchs, their great abundance and diversity, and good stratigraphic control of the sections examined allows one to establish a detailed middle Cambrian (Series 3) acritarch biozonation, and to consider their potential usefulness for global Cambrian chronostratigraphy. Six middle Cambrian (Series 3) zones (IMC1â€“IMC6), and one Furongian assemblage in the Barrios Formation are recognized. The IMC1â€“IMC5 zones, previously described in a preliminary manner (Palacios, 2008), are now characterized in detail, and a new IMC6 Zone is defined which is characterized by the first occurrence of Stelliferidium magnum , Timofeevia phosphoritica and T. microretis . The co-occurrence in the study area of acritarchs and trilobites makes it possible to correlate the two types of biozone. New species ( Comasphaeridium maximum sp. nov., Eliasum fombellae sp. nov., Timofeevia simplex sp. nov. Timofeevia heteromorpha sp. nov., Timofeevia densa sp. nov., Tubulosphaera craterae sp. nov., and Vulcanisphaera cantabrica sp. nov.) are recognized, and the diagnoses of Eliasum , and Symplassosphaeridium cambriense are emended.",2015,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
Learning Feature Nonlinearities with Regularized Binned Regression,"For various applications, the relations between the dependent and independent variables are highly nonlinear. Consequently, for large scale complex problems, neural networks and regression trees are commonly preferred over linear models such as Lasso. This work proposes learning the feature nonlinearities by binning feature values and finding the best fit in each quantile using non-convex regularized linear regression. The algorithm first captures the dependence between neighboring quantiles by enforcing smoothness via piecewise-constant/linear approximation and then selects a sparse subset of good features. We prove that the proposed algorithm is statistically and computationally efficient. In particular, it achieves linear rate of convergence while requiring near-minimal number of samples. Evaluations on real datasets demonstrate that algorithm is competitive with current state-of-the-art and accurately learns feature nonlinearities.",2019,2019 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)
