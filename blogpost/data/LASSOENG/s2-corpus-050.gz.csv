Detection of DNA Copy Number Variations Using Penalized Least Absolute Deviations Regression,"Deletions and amplifications of the human genomic DNA copy number are the cause of numerous diseases such as various forms of cancer. Therefore, the detection of DNA copy number variations (CNV) is important in understanding the genetic basis of disease. Various techniques and platforms have been developed for genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number, such as array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and high-resolution mapping using high-density tiling oligonucleotide arrays. Since complicated biological and experimental processes are involved in these platforms, data can be contaminated by outliers. Inspired by the robustness property of the LAD regression, we propose a penalized LAD regression with the fused lasso penalty for detecting CNV. This method incorporates the spatial dependence and sparsity of CNV into the analysis and is computationally feasible for high-dimensional array-based data. We evaluate the proposed method using simulation studies, which indicate that it can correctly detect the numbers and locations of the true breakpoints while controlling the false positives appropriately. We demonstrate the proposed method on two real data examples.",2007,
"Synthesis, Characterization, and Applications of Polymer-grafted Lignin Surfactants","Surfactants are among the broadest class of compounds utilized in industrial applications. However, many industrially used surfactants have detrimental environmental effects and are primarily derived from petroleum-based feedstocks. Agreen surfactant based on lignin, a biopolymer found in plant cell walls, could potentially serve as a renewably sourced surfactant for dispersant and emulsion applications. As amajor waste by-product of paper production generating a use for lignin surfactants could lead to a commercially viable renewable feedstock and create another avenue for utilizingthis waste material. Lignin derivatives, primarily lignosulfonates, have seen extensive application as dispersants in cement formulations but have been slowly replaced in recent decades by more active petroleum-based synthetic polymers. In this work we sought to develop lignin surfactants by augmenting ligninâ€™s natural surfactant activity through the grafting hydrophilic of polymers onto a lignin core. Primarily focusing on utilizing kraft lignin and lignosulfonate cores, this thesis looks at the interplay between lignin core and polymer graft length to determine design principles for cementitious and agriculturalformulations. Chapter 2 in this thesis outlines a synthetic strategy for grafting lignin cores with hydrophilic polymers under basic, aqueous conditions and examining their ability to function as emulsifiers. This strategy was developed with poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (mPEG) grafts utilizing a classic SN2 grafting strategy. These polymer graftedlignins (PLGN) were then examined for their activity at air-water and oil-water interfaces and exhibited significantly greater activity than the unmodified lignin cores. It was found that higher levels of interfacial activity were exhibited by PEGylated lignins containing hydrophobic kraft lignin cores and shorter PEG graft lengths. Building upon the nowknown activity of these polymer grafted lignins we sought to utilize them as dispersants in cement and as emulsifiers in agricultural formulations. In Chapter 3 we showed that polymer grafting lignins via the strategies discussedin Chapter 2 improves the dispersing capability of the lignins in cement formulation systems. The grafting strategy was shown to work well with varying PEG graft lengths aswell as with hydrophilic acrylic polymers, poly (methacrylic acid) (PMAA) and poly (sulfopropyl methacrylate) (PSPMA). Slump, a measure of cement dispersing capability, was increased by lignins grafted with PEG, PMAA, or SPMA polymer grafts with PMAA grafts having the largest effects. The polymer grafted lignins with the charged, hydrophilic lignosulfonate cores also exhibited better dispersing abilities likely due to the electrostatic interactions the of the lignosulfonate core with the highly charged cementmixture. While the polymer grafted lignins do not perform as well as commercially standard poly (carboxylate ether)s (PCE), the significant increase in dispersing abilitygained by grafting charged polymers to the lignin core indicates potential for lignins to be viable in future cement applications. Chapter 4 covers the steps utilized for market research on the viability of the PEGylated lignin surfactants synthesized in Chapter 2. This study was utilized todetermine the value propositions of the PGLNs and future directions for the project. It was found that the value proposition of being a multi-functional. green dispersant was of interest in agricultural applications leading to these applications being explored further in Chapters 5 and 6. Chapter 5 of this thesis takes a closer look at tank-mix agricultural applications, in which polymer grafted lignins with high oil-water interfacial activity were desired. Thehighly active PEGylated lignins synthesized in Chapter 1 were then formulated with the herbicide formulation, clethodim 2EC, and sprayed on v2 stage corn plants to examine whether they increased the effectiveness of the herbicide. Results imply that an increase in clethodim 2EC effectiveness was found in formulations containing the PEGylated kraft lignin with the short PEG chain. The increase in effectiveness was comparable to commercially available industrial standards, Superb HC and Prime Oil, thus indicating a potential application for these polymer grafted lignins. Chapter 6 builds upon the agricultural applications in Chapter 5 to further explore agricultural formulations using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis techniques to quantitatively identify the physiochemical propertiesimportant to formulation biological activity with the aim of designing an optimal formulation containing polymer-grafted lignins. Emulsion concentrate (EC) agriculturalformulations dependent on oil-water interactions were examined using the oily herbicide clethodim while water dispersible granule (WDG) formulations will be examined using the solid herbicide cloransulam-methyl. Examining both EC and WDG formulations aided in creating a stronger understanding of polymer grafted ligninsâ€™ emulsifying anddispersing capabilities.",2019,
Predicting the Development of Normal-Appearing White Matter With Radiomics in the Aging Brain: A Longitudinal Clinical Study,"Background: Normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) refers to the normal, yet diseased tissue around the white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on conventional MR images. Radiomics is an emerging quantitative imaging technique that provides more details than a traditional visual analysis. This study aims to explore whether WMH could be predicted during the early stages of NAWM, using a textural analysis in the general elderly population. Methods: Imaging data were obtained from PACS between 2012 and 2017. The subjects (â‰¥60 years) received two or more MRI exams on the same scanner with time intervals of more than 1 year. By comparing the baseline and follow-up images, patients with noted progression of WMH were included as the case group (n = 51), while age-matched subjects without WMH were included as the control group (n = 51). Segmentations of the regions of interest (ROIs) were done with the ITK software. Two ROIs of developing NAWM (dNAWM) and non-developing NAWM (non-dNAWM) were drawn separately on the FLAIR images of each patient. dNAWM appeared normal on the baseline images, yet evolved into WMH on the follow-up images. Non-dNAWM appeared normal on both the baseline and follow-up images. A third ROI of normal white matter (NWM) was extracted from the control group, which was normal on both baseline and follow-up images. Textural features were dimensionally reduced with ANOVA+MW, correlation analysis, and LASSO. Three models were built based on the optimal parameters of dimensional reduction, including Model 1 (NWM vs. dNAWM), Model 2 (non-dNAWM vs. dNAWM), and Model 3 (NWM vs. non-dNAWM). The ROC curve was adopted to evaluate the classification validity of these models. Results: Basic characteristics of the patients and controls showed no significant differences. The AUC of Model 1 in training and test groups were 0.967 (95% CI: 0.831-0.999) and 0.954 (95% CI: 0.876-0.989), respectively. The AUC of Model 2 were 0.939 (95% CI: 0.856-0.982) and 0.846 (95% CI: 0.671-0.950). The AUC of Model 3 were 0.713 (95% CI: 0.593-0.814) and 0.667 (95% CI: 0.475-0.825). Conclusion: Radiomics textural analysis can distinguish dNAWM from non-dNAWM on FLAIR images, which could be used for the early detection of NAWM lesions before they develop into visible WHM.",2018,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience
An empirical investigation of sparse log-linear models for improved dialogue act classification,"Previous work on dialogue act classification have primarily focused on dense generative and discriminative models. However, since the automatic speech recognition (ASR) outputs are often noisy, dense models might generate biased estimates and overfit to the training data. In this paper, we study sparse modeling approaches to improve dialogue act classification, since the sparse models maintain a compact feature space, which is robust to noise. To test this, we investigate various element-wise frequentist shrinkage models such as lasso, ridge, and elastic net, as well as structured sparsity models and a hierarchical sparsity model that embed the dependency structure and interaction among local features. In our experiments on a real-world dataset, when augmenting N-best word and phone level ASR hypotheses with confusion network features, our best sparse log-linear model obtains a relative improvement of 19.7% over a rule-based baseline, a 3.7% significant improvement over a traditional non-sparse log-linear model, and outperforms a state-of-the-art SVM model by 2.2%.",2013,"2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing"
Effect of Pre-deforming on Low Temperature Plasma Nitriding of Austenitic Stainless Steel,"In spite of the excellent corrosion resistance of theaustenitic stainless steels, they are a relatively soft classof materials that are expected to face obstacles when usedfor applications that require resistance to both corrosionand wear. A method for hardening the surface of austeniticstainless steel has been examined as a countermeasure tothiswearproblem.Traditionalmethodssuchascarburizingand nitriding treatments have been applied to modify thesurfaces of stainless steels and other ferrous materials. Thelow processing temperature and low heat treatmentdistortion of the nitriding process have attracted consider-able interest from a technological point of view, and a greatdeal of research has been performed to obtain high surfacehardness by nitriding treatments.Plasma nitriding has been widely used in industrialproduction to increase the surface hardness and the wearresistance of materials. Generally, the treatment tempera-turefortraditionalplasmanitridingis773â€“843 Kinordertoobtain a sufï¬ciently thick nitrided layer. However, CrNprecipitation occurs for most stainless steels when thenitridingtemperatureisincreasedabove723 K,sothattheircorrosion resistance is largely decreased. To avoid theprecipitation of CrN, plasma nitriding can be conducted ata low temperature, normally below 723 K, and then aso-called S phase with high hardness and better corrosionresistance is obtained on the surface of the austeniticstainless steel.",2009,Plasma Processes and Polymers
BAYESIAN DEFORMABLE MODELS BUILDING 3 a penalized likelihood ( PL ) or the more recent maximum description length approach in,"The problem of the definition and the estimation of generative models based on deformable templates from raw data is of particular importance for modeling nonaligned data affected by various types of geometrical variability. This is especially true in shape modeling in the computer vision community or in probabilistic atlas building in Computational Anatomy. A first coherent statistical framework modeling the geometrical variability as hidden variables was described in AllassonniÃ¨re, Amit, and TrouvÃ© (2007). The present paper gives a theoretical proof of convergence of effective stochastic approximation expectation strategies to estimate such models and shows the robustness of this approach against noise through numerical experiments in the context of handwritten digit modeling.",2009,
Confidence region and intervals for sparse penalized regression using variational inequality techniques,"LIANG YIN: CONFIDENCE REGION AND INTERVALS FOR SPARSE PENALIZED REGRESSION USING VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY TECHNIQUES. (Under the direction of Shu Lu and Yufeng Liu.) With the abundance of large data, sparse penalized regression techniques are commonly used in data analysis due to the advantage of simultaneous variable selection and prediction. By introducing biases on the estimators, sparse penalized regression methods can often select a simpler model than unpenalized regression. A number of convex as well as non-convex penalties have been proposed in the literature to achieve sparsity. Despite intense work in this area, it remains unclear on how to perform valid inference for sparse penalized regression with a general penalty. In this work, by making use of state-of-the-art optimization tools in variational inequality theory, we propose a unified framework to construct confidence intervals for sparse penalized regression with a wide range of penalties, including the well-known least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty and the minimax concave penalty (MCP). We study the inference for two types of parameters: the parameters under the population version of the penalized regression and the parameters in the underlying linear model. Theoretical convergence properties of the proposed methods are obtained. Simulated and real data examples are presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed inference procedure.",2015,
Prediction of Cancer Cell Sensitivity to Drugs,"We consider the problem of using high-dimensional genomic covariates to predict the drug response of cancer cell lines. The cell lines are grouped according to tissue type, which we show may be an important factor in determining the dependence of drug response on genomic covariates. We develop predictors using l1-penalized linear regression models, and develop a novel variant which we call the indicator lasso which exploits inherent group structure. The superior performance of this new method in simulations over other methods which neglect group structure is illustrated. We finish by presenting the drug response prediction results.",2013,
Faster Coordinate Descent via Adaptive Importance Sampling,"Coordinate descent methods employ random partial updates of decision variables in order to solve huge-scale convex optimization problems. In this work, we introduce new adaptive rules for the random selection of their updates. By adaptive, we mean that our selection rules are based on the dual residual or the primal-dual gap estimates and can change at each iteration. We theoretically characterize the performance of our selection rules and demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art, and extend our theory and algorithms to general convex objectives. Numerical evidence with hinge-loss support vector machines and Lasso confirm that the practice follows the theory.",2017,ArXiv
Roles of singleton tryptophan motifs in COPI coat stability and vesicle tethering.,"Coat protein I (COPI)-coated vesicles mediate retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as well as transport within the Golgi. Major progress has been made in defining the structure of COPI coats, in vitro and in vivo, at resolutions as high as 9 Ã…. Nevertheless, important questions remain unanswered, including what specific interactions stabilize COPI coats, how COPI vesicles recognize their target membranes, and how coat disassembly is coordinated with vesicle fusion and cargo delivery. Here, we use X-ray crystallography to identify a conserved site on the COPI subunit Î±-COP that binds to flexible, acidic sequences containing a single tryptophan residue. One such sequence, found within Î±-COP itself, mediates Î±-COP homo-oligomerization. Another such sequence is contained within the lasso of the ER-resident Dsl1 complex, where it helps mediate the tethering of Golgi-derived COPI vesicles at the ER membrane. Together, our findings suggest that Î±-COP homo-oligomerization plays a key role in COPI coat stability, with potential implications for the coordination of vesicle tethering, uncoating, and fusion.",2019,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
"High inter- and intraspecific niche overlap among three sympatrically breeding, closely-related seabird species: Generalist foraging as an adaptation to a highly variable environment?","1.Ecological niche theory predicts sympatric species to show segregation in their spatio-temporal habitat utilization or diet as a strategy to avoid competition. Similarly, within species individuals may specialise on specific dietary resources or foraging habitats. Such individual specialisation seems to occur particularly in environments with predictable resource distribution and limited environmental variability. Still little is known about how seasonal environmental variability affects segregation of resources within species and between closely related sympatric species. 2.The aim of the study was to investigate the foraging behaviour of three closely related and sympatrically breeding fulmarine petrels (Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica, cape petrels Daption capense and southern fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides) in a seasonally highly variable environment (Prydz Bay, Antarctica) with the aim of assessing inter- and intraspecific overlap in utilized habitat, timing of foraging, and diet and to identify foraging habitat preferences. 3.We used GPS loggers with wet/dry sensors to assess spatial habitat utilization over the entire breeding season. Trophic overlap was investigated using stable isotope analysis based on blood, feathers and egg membranes. Foraging locations were identified using wet/dry data recorded by the GPS loggers and Expectation-Maximization binary Clustering (EMbC). Foraging habitat preferences were modelled using GAMs and model cross-validation. 4.During incubation and chick rearing, the utilization distribution of all three species overlapped significantly and species also overlapped in the timing of foraging during the day - partly during incubation and completely during chick-rearing. Isotopic centroids showed no significant segregation between at least two species for feathers and egg membranes,, and among all species during incubation (reflected by blood). Within species, there was no individual specialization in foraging sites or environmental space. Furthermore, no single environmental covariate predicted foraging activity along trip trajectories. Instead, best-explanatory environmental covariates varied within and between individuals even across short temporal scales, reflecting a highly generalist behaviour of birds. 5.Our results may be explained by optimal foraging theory. In the highly productive but spatio-temporally variable Antarctic environment, being a generalist may be key to finding mobile prey - even though this increases the potential for competition within and among sympatric species.

Three Essays on the Application of Machine Learning Methods in Economics,"OF DISSERTATION THREE ESSAYS ON THE APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING METHODS IN ECONOMICS Over the last decades, economics as a field has experienced a profound transformation from theoretical work toward an emphasis on empirical research (Hamermesh, 2013). One common constraint of empirical studies is the access to data, the quality of the data and the time span it covers. In general, applied studies rely on surveys, administrative or private sector data. These data are limited and rarely have universal or near universal population coverage. The growth of the internet has made available a vast amount of digital information. These big digital data are generated through social networks, sensors, and online platforms. These data account for an increasing part of the economic activity yet for economists, the availability of these big data also raises many new challenges related to the techniques needed to collect, manage, and derive knowledge from them. The data are in general unstructured, complex, voluminous and the traditional software used for economic research are not always effective in dealing with these types of data. Machine learning is a branch of computer science that uses statistics to deal with big data. The objective of this dissertation is to reconcile machine learning and economics. It uses threes case studies to demonstrate how data freely available online can be harvested and used in economics. The dissertation uses web scraping to collect large volume of unstructured data online. It uses machine learning methods to derive information from the unstructured data and show how this information can be used to answer economic questions or address econometric issues. The first essay shows how machine learning can be used to derive sentiments from reviews and using the sentiments as a measure for quality it examines an old economic theory: Price competition in oligopolistic markets. The essay confirms the economic theory that agents compete for price. It also confirms that the quality measure derived from sentiment analysis of the reviews is a valid proxy for quality and influences price. The second essay uses a random forest algorithm to show that reviews can be harnessed to predict consumersâ€™ preferences. The third essay shows how properties description can be used to address an old but still actual problem in hedonic pricing models: the Omitted Variable Bias. Using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) it shows that pricing errors in hedonic models can be reduced by including the description of the properties in the models.",2018,
Climate Change Awareness and Willingness to Pay for its Mitigation: Evidence from the UK,"We explore an unprecedented dataset of almost 6000 observations to identify main predictors of climate knowledge, climate risk perception and willingness to pay for climate change mitigation. Among nearly 70 potential explanatory variables we detect the most important ones using multisplit lasso estimator. Importantly, we test significance of individuals' preferences about time, risk and equity. Our study is innovative as these behavioural characteristics were recorded by including experimental methods into a live sample survey. This unique way of data collection combines advantages of survey and experiments. The most important predictors of environmental attitudes are numeracy, cognitive ability, ideological world-view and inequity aversion.",2018,

Toarcian(Early Jurassic)Oceanic Anoxic Event and the Responses in Terrestrial Ecological System,"The early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event(T-OAE)has been studied for nearly 30years.Many western researchers had made a package of discoveries by studying on the sedimentology,paleontology and geochemistry around the West Europe and Mediterranean areas.Since the beginning of the 21st century,the Toarcian event has turned to be one of the international hot topics with regard to the Mesozoic geology,which has been extended beyond the Europe,approaching the Southern Hemisphere.The intensive studies in marine strata illustrate a rising eustatic sea level,high sea surface temperature,anoxic low waters and the eutrophic surface waters in that period,which is associated with the wide distribution of black shales and the abnormity of carbon isotope,oxygen isotope,strontium isotope,osmium isotope,nitrogen isotope and Mg/Ca ratios,and mass extinction.Occurrence of the T-OAE is not only confined to the Boreal Ocean and Tethys Ocean but also the Pathalassa Ocean and the records from both the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere demonstrate that it is a global event.However,current studies are generally limited to marine sediments,while the impacts of and responses to the T-OAE in the terrestrial ecological systems are quite poorly known.According to reviews on the previous works on the terrestrial Jurassic system in northern China and the other parts of the world,we summarize the responses in the terrestrial ecological systems as follows:(1)obviously waning or ceasing coal-bearing deposits,emerging red sediments or dark lacustrine shales;(2)distinctively declining in the previous floras,thermophilous plants increasing in floras and immigrating to higher latitude areas;high contents of Classopollis pollen occurring in palynolopical assemblages;(3)temperature rising and aridity turning up,boundary of climatic zones moving towards higher latitude.China yields one of the best Jurassic terrestrial strata across the world.Especially,during the Early-Middle Jurassic in northern China,the climate generally kept warm and humid and thus several large lacustrine basins continuously occurred.The outcrops of Lower-Middle Jurassic are complete and rich in variety of fossils,which provide the ideal places and materials for studying on the impacts of and responses to the T-OAE in the terrestrial ecological systems.With more in-depth studies,scientists are expected to make important scientific contributions in this field.",2012,
Cytochrome respiration pathway and sulphur metabolism sustain stress tolerance to low temperature in the Antarctic species Colobanthus quitensis.,"-Understanding the strategies employed by plant species that live in extreme environments offers the possibility to discover stress tolerance mechanisms. We studied the physiological, antioxidant and metabolic responses to three temperature conditions (4, 15 and 23ÂºC) of Colobanthus quitensis (CQ), one of the only two native vascular species in Antarctica. We also employed Dianthus chinensis (DC), to asssess the effects of the treatments in a non-antarctic species from the same family. -Using fused LASSO modeling we associated physiological and biochemical antioxidant responses with primary metabolism. This approach allowed us to highlight the metabolic pathways driving the response specific to CQ. -Low temperature imposed dramatic reductions in photosynthesis (up to 88%) but not in respiration (sustaining rates of 3.0-4.2 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1 ) in CQ, and any change in the physiological stress parameters was found. Its notable antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial cytochrome respiratory activity (20 and 2 times higher than DC, respectively) which ensure ATP production even at low temperature, was significantly associated to sulphur-containing metabolites and polyamines. -Our findings potentially open new biotechnological opportunities regarding the role of antioxidant compounds and respiratory mechanisms associated to sulphur metabolism in stress tolerance strategies to low temperature.

Sparse Reconstruction of Glucose Fluxes using Continuous Glucose Monitors.,"A new technique for estimating postprandial glucose flux profiles without the use of glucose tracers is proposed. The technique assumes knowledge of patient parameters relevant to the glucose, insulin and endogoneous glucose production subsystems. A convex Lasso formulation is used to estimate the glucose fluxes that combines (1) the known patient parameters; (2) a sparse vector space encoding the space of plausible glucose flux profiles; (3) continuous glucose monitor measurements taken during the meal; (4) amount of insulin injected; (5) amount of meal carbohydrates and (6) an estimate of the initial conditions. Three glucose fluxes are estimated: glucose rate of appearance from the intestine; endogenous glucose production from the liver; insulin dependent glucose utilization and other important state variables. Sparse encoding of a large set of simulated glucose fluxes using the UVa Padova simulator is used so that a sparse representation of the space of plausible glucose flux profiles is obtained. The estimation technique was validated in both simulation and experiments on 3 T1DM patients undergoing the triple tracer meal protocol. The results indicate that the technique is capable of reproducing the triple tracer measurements while estimating the missing measurements for a certain model parameter selection.",2019,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics

UbiSitePred: A novel method for improving the accuracy of ubiquitination sites prediction by using LASSO to select the optimal Chou's pseudo components,"Abstract Ubiquitination is an essential process in protein post-translational modification, which plays a crucial role in cell life activities, such as proteasomal degradation, transcriptional regulation, and DNA damage repair. Therefore, recognition of ubiquitination sites is a crucial step to understand the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination. However, the experimental verification of numerous ubiquitination sites is time-consuming and costly. To alleviate these issues, a computational approach is needed to predict ubiquitination sites. This paper proposes a new method called UbiSitePred for predicting ubiquitination sites combined least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature selection and support vector machine. First, we use binary encoding (BE), pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC), the composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (CKSAAP), position-specific propensity matrices (PSPM) to extract the sequence feature information; thus, the initial feature space is obtained. Secondly, LASSO is applied to remove the feature redundancy information and selects the optimal feature subset. Finally, the optimal feature subset is input into the support vector machine (SVM) to predict the ubiquitination sites. Five-fold cross-validation shows that UbiSitePred model can achieve a better prediction performance compared with other methods, the AUC values for Set1, Set2, and Set3 are 0.9998, 0.8887, and 0.8481, respectively. Notably, the UbiSitePred has overall accuracy rates of 98.33%, 81.12%, and 76.90%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly superior to other state-of-the-art prediction methods and provide a new idea for the prediction of other post-translational modification sites of proteins.

Combination of multi-locus genome-wide association study and QTL mapping reveals genetic basis of tassel architecture in maize,"Maize tassel architecture is a complex quantitative trait that is significantly correlated with biomass yield and grain yield. The present study evaluated the major trait of maize tassel architecture, namely, tassel branch number (TBN), in an association population of 359 inbred lines and an IBM Syn 10 population of 273 doubled haploid lines across three environments. Approximately 43,958 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms were utilized to detect significant QTNs associated with TBN based on new multi-locus genome-wide association study methods. There were 30, 38, 73, 40, 47, and 53 QTNs associated with tassel architecture that were detected using the FastmrEMMA, FastmrMLM, EM-BLASSO, mrMLM, pkWMEB, and pLARmEB models, respectively. Among these QTNs, 51 were co-identified by at least two of these methods. In addition, 12 QTNs were consistently detected across multiple environments. Furthermore, 19 QTLs distributed on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 were detected in 3 environments and the BLUP model based on 6618 bin markers, which explained 3.64â€“10.96% of the observed phenotypic variations in TBN. Of these, three QTLs were co-detected in two environments. One QTN associated with TBN was localized to one QTL. Approximately 55 candidate genes were detected by common QTNs and LD criteria. One candidate gene, Zm00001d016615, was identified as a putative target of the RA1 gene. Meanwhile, RA1 was previously validated to plays an important role in tassel development. In addition, the newly identified candidate genes Zm00001d003939, Zm00001d030212, Zm00001d011189, and Zm00001d042794 have been reported to involve in a spikelet meristem identity module.

Tradeoffs in improved screening of lasso problems,"Recently, methods of screening the lasso problem have been developed that use the target vector x to quickly identify a subset of columns of the dictionary that will receive zero weight in the solution. Current classes of screening tests are based on bounding the dual lasso solution within a sphere or the intersection of a sphere and a half space. Stronger tests are possible but are more complex and incur a higher computational cost. To investigate this, we determine the optimal screening test when the dual lasso solution is bounded within the intersection of a sphere and two half spaces, and empirically investigate the trade-off that this test makes between screening power and computational efficiency. We also compare its performance both in terms of rejection power and efficiency to existing test classes. The new test always has better rejection, and for an interesting range of regularization parameters, offers better computational efficiency.",2013,"2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing"
"Relationships between circulating S-antigens, naturally acquired antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum exoantigens and malaria attack in a mesoendemic area.","A survey involving 77 individuals living in two savannah villages near Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso, West Africa), was performed in June 1987 (before), August-September (during) and January 1988 after the seasonal transmission. The clinical longitudinal study during the seasonal period permitted us to define three different groups in terms of both age and occurrence of malaria attack (MA; greater than or equal to 5000 parasites/mm3 of blood and axillary fever greater than or equal to 37.8 degrees C). The presence of circulating stable antigen (S-Ag) and the antibody responses against exoantigens (E-Ag) of Plasmodium falciparum were also evaluated at three observations periods: beginning, during and after the transmission season. The adult group (III) had the highest rates of IgG Ab to E-Ag although, IgM prevalence to E-Ag was maximal in the group II (individuals with no malaria attack and age less than or equal to 15 years old). Group I (persons with less than or equal to 15 years old and who contracted at least one MA) did not have any S-Ag at the first observation period and showed the lowest rate of antibodies to E-Ag. The probability of occurrence of an MA calculated from these parameters at the beginning of the transmission period were correct in 78.9% of the cases in children (Groups I & II) and in 71.8% of adults during the subsequent transmission period. Therefore these values could be used for evaluating the probability of occurrence of a clinical MA during the transmission period in a mesoendemic area. S-Ag and antibodies to E-Ag could participate positively in the mechanisms involved in the development of the immune status.",1992,Acta tropica
Variable Selection for Structural Equation with Endogeneity,"This paper studies variable selection problem in structural equation of a two-stage least squares (2SLS) model in presence of endogeneity which is commonly encountered in empirical economic studies. Model uncertainty and variable selection in the structural equation is an important issue as described in Andrews and Lu (2001) and Caner (2009). The authors propose an adaptive Lasso 2SLS estimator for linear structural equation with endogeneity and show that it enjoys the oracle properties, i.e., the consistency in both estimation and model selection. In Monte Carlo simulations, the authors demonstrate that the proposed estimator has smaller bias and MSE compared with the bridge-type GMM estimator (Caner, 2009). In a case study, the authors revisit the classic returns to education problem (Angrist and Krueger, 1991) using the China Population census data. The authors find that the education level not only has strong effects on income but also shows heterogeneity in different age cohorts.",2018,Journal of Systems Science and Complexity
Selection of lags and univariate models to forecast industrial production in an Emerging country: is disagreggation useful?,"A point to address is if the use of disaggregated data helps in forecasting variables. Our point is whether the prediction of the disaggregated components of Brazilian industrial production improves the accuracy of the forecast of aggregate Brazilian industrial production. Our contribution is that we do not know articles that address the contribution of the disaggregated data of the weighted lag adaptative least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (WLadaLASSO) methodology or the exponential smoothing (selecting the most appropriate model). We estimate a rolling window of 100 xed observations and we evaluate the forecast from 1 to 12 months ahead for Brazilian industrial production, in which we estimate 61 rolling windows. Our results point to a better performance of the exponential smoothing model with disaggregated data for the forecast of 1 to 7 months ahead for Brazilian industrial production by mean square error (MSE). But WLadaLASSO disaggregated forecasts with more accuracy for 8 to 12 months ahead by MSE.",2018,
Decision Support Systems : The Fascination with Closed-Loop Control,"To the engineer a closed-loop control system refers to using a controller with a feedback loop to control states or outputs of a dynamic system. That dynamic system might be the cruise (speed) control on your automobile, maintaining a patientâ€™s paO 2 with a ventilator, controlling depth of anesthesia with an anesthesia machine, or controlling arterial blood pressure with medications from an IV pump. To a cowboy from the Wild West a closed â€œloopâ€ might be considered a lariat or lasso rope, used to rope cattle. Similarly, for some in medical informatics, closed-loop control means surrounding a medical problem area to better manage it. I suggest that, in fact, there is a broad range of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems and that closed-loop controllers represent only one specif ic type. CDS systems include diagnostic systems, intelligent Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE), alarming and alerting systems, care advice systems, etc. These CDS systems can be used to help with tasks such as optimizing blood ordering, medication selection and dosing, and using protocols to improve and optimize patient care. Since the 1950â€™s, when physicians began to understand control system theory, there has been a fascination with having these control systems be closedloop without the need for any human intervention. Bickford at the Mayo Clinic was one of the f irst to suggest closed-loop anesthesia, using the electroencephalogram (EEG) as the measure [1]. In 1968 Sheppard and his colleagues, at the University of Alabama, showed that the blood pressure of post operative open-heart patientâ€™s blood pressures could be controlled with closed-loop strategies [2]. Since those early times, when the use of closed-loop systems was the ultimate decision support strategy, there have been a myriad of other decision support methods developed. However, there still seems to be some magic in being able to â€œclose the loop.â€ Just to give an update on how we are doing some 50 to 60 years later with implementing closed-loop systems, articles in this Yearbook have addressed the topic [3, 4]. Recently, considerable literature on the clinical implementation of closed-loop control has begun to appear. Two examples: a) the accuracy and clinical feasibility closed-loop control of the hypnotic component of anesthesia was recently reported [5]; b) in addition, news reports indicate that closed-loop control of insulin administration for diabetics, the so-called â€œartif icial pancreas,â€ is coming closer to reality [6]. As I was preparing this Keynote manuscript, I began to ask myself why hadnâ€™t our group at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City developed and published ANY work on operational closed-loop control systems. After all, our entire group has hundreds of publications, and most of them are in the f ield of decision support and Medical Informatics. So, I took the opportunity to refresh my memory on the almost 50 years of Medical Informatics history that I have lived through. It quickly became apparent that as a consequence of working at LDS Hospital with our mentor Homer R. Warner [7] and colleagues T. Allan Pryor, R. Scott Evans, Paul D.

Predicting late radiation-induced xerostomia with parotid gland PET biomarkers and dose metrics.,"PURPOSE
To assess associations between parotid gland PET biomarkers and late radiation-induced xerostomia, and to validate improvement of xerostomia predictive models by adding pre-treatment PET features to models based on dose and pre-treatment xerostomia.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Intensity PET features from 47 patients treated on institutional prospective clinical trials for HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with uniform chemoRT were analyzed. Associations between 90th percentile of the parotid gland standardized uptake values (P90) from pre-treatment and post-treatment PET scans, mean parotid gland doses, and late xerostomia defined by the Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ) and salivary flow rates were quantified. Multivariable analysis was applied for dose and PET features using penalized logistic regression for feature selection and generation of predictive models using the LASSO technique, and optimism bias was estimated by bootstrap resampling.


RESULTS
Significant associations between late xerostomia and both mean parotid gland dose and P90 were demonstrated, and were generally stronger for post-treatment PET scans. The addition of P90 from pre-treatment PET scans improved the prediction model for late moderate or severe xerostomia compared to the base model, from AUCÂ =Â 0.74 to 0.78 (p-value <0.001) for XQ summary score and from 0.77 to 0.84 (p-value <0.001) for the single eating-related XQ item with the largest inter-patient variability; however, only the latter remained significant on cross validation (AUCÂ =Â 0.69 to 0.70 and 0.73 to 0.80, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
The addition of pre-treatment parotid gland PET biomarkers improved a predictive model for late patient-reported xerostomia over dose and pre-treatment xerostomia.",2020,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology
Identification of surgical site infections using electronic health record data,"HighlightsThe model correctly classified 89% of patients within 30 days after surgery.The comprehensive model was better than available methods.The best model classified 80% of SSIs and 90% of noâ€SSIs correctly.The best model used 35 variables from the electronic health record. Background: The objective of this study was to develop an algorithm for identifying surgical site infections (SSIs) using independent variables from electronic health record data and outcomes from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program to supplement manual chart review. Methods: We fit 3 models to data from patients undergoing operations at the University of Colorado Hospital between 2013 and 2015: a similar model reported previously in the literature, a comprehensive model with 136 possible predictors, and a combination of those. All models used a generalized linear model with a lasso penalty. Several techniques for handling imbalance in the outcome were also used: Youden's J statistic to optimize the probability cutoff and sampling techniques combined with Youden's J. The models were then tested on data from patients undergoing operations during 2016. Results: Two hundred thirty of 6,840 patients (3.4%) had an SSI. The comprehensive model fit to the full set of training data performed the best, achieving 90% specificity, 80% sensitivity, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89. Conclusions: We identified a model that accurately identified SSIs. The framework presented can be easily implemented by other American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Programâ€participating hospitals to develop models for enhancing surveillance of SSIs.",2018,AJIC (American Journal of Infection Control)
"An outbreak of kerato-conjunctivitis among corralled, supplementary fed, semi-domestic reindeer calves","The winter 1993-94 was hard with periods of severe cold and a thick, snow layer. In the beginning of January 1994, approximately 500 reindeer calves were separated from the main herd and corralled for supplementary feeding. During this period around 30 calves died by emaciation and other circumstances related to the change in feeding regimes. Fourteen days later, the calves were rounded up, lassoed and transported around 50 km to another corral. The animals, under severe stress and underfed were offered an insufficiently pelleted feed. After two days, some animals showed signs of eye irritation and on the third and fourth days, several calves had developed unilateral or bilateral kerato-conjunctivitis and blindness. The remaining 390 calves, were slaughtered at the end of January. During the time spent in the second corral, around 80 calves died by emaciation, some of them were blind. Around 300 calves were then, or had been, affected. Of these about 240 were unilaterally blind and 60 bilaterally blind. Bacteriological, virological, electron-microscopical and histopathological investigations showed that fodder particles in the conjunctival sac caused the primary lesions which were secondarily invaded by opportunistic bacteria. The stressful situation of the calves may have contributed to the severity and the rapid development of the lesions.",1995,Rangifer
Pressure marks,"Selections and actions in GUI's are often separated -- i.e. an action or command typically follows a selection. This sequence imposes a lower bound on the interaction time that is equal to or greater than the sum of its parts. In this paper, we introduce pressure marks -- pen strokes where the variations in pressure make it possible to indicate both a selection and an action simultaneously. We propose a series of design guidelines from which we develop a set of four basictypes of pressure marks. We first assess the viability of this set through an exploratory study that looks at the way users draw straight and lasso pressure marks of different sizes and orientations. We then present the results of a quantitative experiment that shows that users perform faster selection-action interactions with pressure marks than with a combination of lassos and pigtails. Based on these results, we present and discuss a number of interaction designs that incorporate pressure marks.",2007,
Regularised Model Identification Improves Accuracy of Multisensor Systems for Noninvasive Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Diabetes Management,"Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) by suitable portable sensors plays a central role in the treatment of diabetes, a disease currently affecting more than 350 million people worldwide. Noninvasive CGM (NI-CGM), in particular, is appealing for reasons related to patient comfort (no needles are used) but challenging. NI-CGM prototypes exploiting multisensor approaches have been recently proposed to deal with physiological and environmental disturbances. In these prototypes, signals measured noninvasively (e.g., skin impedance, temperature, optical skin properties, etc.) are combined through a static multivariate linear model for estimating glucose levels. In this work, by exploiting a dataset of 45 experimental sessions acquired in diabetic subjects, we show that regularisation-based techniques for the identification of the model, such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (better known as LASSO), Ridge regression, and Elastic-Net regression, improve the accuracy of glucose estimates with respect to techniques, such as partial least squares regression, previously used in the literature. More specifically, the Elastic-Net model (i.e., the model identified using a combination of and norms) has the best results, according to the metrics widely accepted in the diabetes community. This model represents an important incremental step toward the development of NI-CGM devices effectively usable by patients.",2013,J. Applied Mathematics
LASSO-Patternsearch algorithm with application to ophthalmology data,"The LASSO-Patternsearch is proposed, as a two-stage procedure to identify clusters of multiple risk factors for outcomes of interest in large demographic studies, when the predictor variables are dichotomous or take on values in a small finite set. Many diseases are suspected of having multiple interacting risk factors acting in concert, and it is of much interest to uncover higher order interactions when they exist. The method is related to Zhang et al(2004) except that variable flexibility is sacrificed to allow entertaining models with high as well as low order interactions among multiple predictors. A LASSO is used to select important patterns, being applied conservatively to have a high rate of retention of true patterns, while allowing some noise. Then the patterns selected by the LASSO are tested in the framework of (parametric) generalized linear models to reduce the noise. Notably, the patterns are those that arise naturally from the log linear expansion of the multivariate Bernoulli density. Separate tuning procedures are proposed for the LASSO step and then the parametric step and a novel computational algorithm for the LASSO step is developed to handle the large number of unknowns in the problem. The method is applied to data from the Beaver Dam Eye Study and is shown to expose physiologically interesting interacting risk factors. In a study of progression of myopia in an older cohort, it is found in this group that the risk for smokers is reduced by taking vitamins, while the risk for non-smokers is independent of the â€œtaking vitaminsâ€ variable, which is in agreement with the general result that smoking reduces the absorption of vitamins, and certain vitamins have been",2006,
antitropical clade of temperate freshwater fishes,"Aim Any discovery of new biogeographical pattern in landlocked animals may challenge hypotheses that account for the evolution of intercontinental faunas. In this study, we examined the evolutionary origin and historical biogeography of temperate, freshwater perch-like fishes within a molecular phylogenetic framework. Location Temperate Eastern Eurasia, the Americas and Australia. Methods Data from five nuclear markers obtained from 15 targeted species and a broad sampling of percomorphs were assembled to investigate their phylogeny and historical biogeography. We (1) applied a fossil-calibrated Bayesian reconstruction to provide a phylogenetic time-scale for the diversification of the taxa, (2) inferred the evolution of habitat preference through a tree-based character reconstruction method, and (3) reconstructed the evolution of range distributions using a dispersalâ€“extinctionâ€“cladogenesis model. Results We recovered a new antitropical freshwater clade, Percichthyoidea, composed of Sinipercidae, Percichthyidae (including Percilia but excluding Macquaria colonorum), Elassomatidae and Centrarchidae. Our time-scale analysis indicates that the Percichthyoidea originated around the Cretaceousâ€“ Palaeogene transition. Ancestral habitat reconstructions revealed only one marine-to-freshwater transition that preceded the origin of the percichthyoids; the warm-to-temperate transition occurred earlier. Ancestral-area inference indicates a wide-ranging pan-American and Eastern Eurasian distribution of the most recent common ancestor of Percichthyoidea. The initial diversification event occurred between the southern (Percichthyidae) and northern (remaining percichthyoids) clades. A second divergence occurred between Eastern Eurasia (Sinipercidae) and North America (Centrarchidae plus Elassomatidae). The trans-Pacific distribution of the Percichthyidae may have preceded the final breakup of south Gondwana. Main conclusions The present-day distribution of the Percichthyoidea is unique within extant fishes, comprising four trans-Pacific continental blocks across the two hemispheres. Current geological and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions may well explain the longitudinal but not the latitudinal pattern of this freshwater fish clade, as it requires a transequatorial freshwater system connecting temperate regions of South and North America during the Late Cretaceous/Palaeogene. An alternative hypothesis is discussed, in which the ancestor of the Percichthyoidea was not completely adapted to freshwater.",2014,
Using prior expansions for prior-data conflict checking,"Any Bayesian analysis involves combining information represented through different model components, and when different sources of information are in conflict it is important to detect this. Here we consider checking for prior-data conflict in Bayesian models by expanding the prior used for the analysis into a larger family of priors, and considering a marginal likelihood score statistic for the expansion parameter. Consideration of different expansions can be informative about the nature of any conflict, and extensions to hierarchically specified priors and connections with other approaches to prior-data conflict checking are discussed. Implementation in complex situations is illustrated with two applications. The first concerns testing for the appropriateness of a LASSO penalty in shrinkage estimation of coefficients in linear regression. Our method is compared with a recent suggestion in the literature designed to be powerful against alternatives in the exponential power family, and we use this family as the prior expansion for constructing our check. A second application concerns a problem in quantum state estimation, where a multinomial model is considered with physical constraints on the model parameters. In this example, the usefulness of different prior expansions is demonstrated for obtaining checks which are sensitive to different aspects of the prior.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Can miRNAs predict EFS in pediatric AML?,"Purpose Children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) whose disease is refractory to standard induction chemotherapy therapy or who experience relapse after initial response have dismal outcomes. We sought to comprehensively pro le pediatric AML microRNA (miRNA) samples to identify dysregulated genes and assess the utility of miRNAs for improved outcome prediction. Patients and Methods To identify miRNA biomarkers that are associated with treatment failure, we performed a comprehensive sequence-based characterization of the pediatric AML miRNA landscape. miRNA sequencing was performed on 1,362 samplesâ€”1,303 primary, 22 refractory, and 37 relapse samples. One hundred sixty-four matched samplesâ€”127 primary and 37 relapse samplesâ€”were analyzed by using RNA sequencing. Results By using penalized lasso Cox proportional hazards regression, we identi ed 36 miRNAs the expression levels at diagnosis of which were highly associated with event-free survival. Combined expression of the 36 miRNAs was used to create a novel miRNA-based risk classi cation scheme (AMLmiR36). This new miRNA-based risk classi er identi es those patients who are at high risk (hazard ratio, 2.830; P â‰¤ .001) or low risk (hazard ratio, 0.323; P â‰¤ .001) of experiencing treatment failure, independent of conventional karyotype or mutation status. The performance of AMLmiR36 was independently assessed by using 878 patients from two different clinical trials (AAML0531 and AAML1031). Our analysis also revealed that miR-106a-363 was abundantly expressed in relapse and refractory samples, and several candidate targets of miR-106a-5p were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, a process that is suppressed in treatment-resistant leukemic cells. Conclusion To assess the utility of miRNAs for outcome prediction in patients with pediatric AML, we designed and validated a miRNA-based risk classi cation scheme. We also hypothesized that the abundant expression of miR-106a could increase treatment resistance via modulation of genes that are involved in oxidative phosphorylation.",2018,
Identifying Key Predictors of Recidivism among Offenders Attending a Batterer Intervention Program: A Survival Analysis,"espanolLas estrategias para reducir la violencia contra la mujer en las relaciones de pareja pueden dirigirse a diferentes objetivos. Los programas de intervencion para agresores de pareja son uno de los principales acercamientos para su tratamiento. El resultado mas utilizado para la evaluacion de la efectividad de estos programas es la reincidencia. Los esfuerzos para incrementar la efectividad de los programas de intervencion para agresores de pareja en reducir la reincidencia deberian centrarse en las variables predictoras clave de este resultado. El objetivo de este estudio fue identificar los predictores clave de la reincidencia oficial a partir de un amplio conjunto de variables obtenidas a partir de una muestra de hombres participando por mandato judicial en un programa de intervencion para agresores de pareja (N = 393), con un periodo de seguimiento de entre 0 y 69 meses. Con este objetivo, se realizo un analisis de supervivencia utilizando cuatro conjuntos de variables: variables individuales, variables relacionales y contextuales, variables relativas a la violencia y variables relativas al proceso de intervencion. Para incluir simultaneamente todas las variables en el analisis, se estimo un modelo de regresion de Cox utilizando ALASSO (adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). De un conjunto de ochenta y nueve variables, seis fueron seleccionadas como predictores clave: abandono del programa, riesgo de violencia futura contra otras personas, exposicion a violencia familiar, estatus de inmigrante, acumulacion de eventos vitales estresantes e ira rasgo. El area bajo la curva ROC (receiving operator characteristic) fue .808, indicando una buena prediccion del modelo.

The aim of this study was to identify key predictors of official recidivism from a large set of variables drawn from a sample of IPVAW offenders court-mandated to a community-based BIP (N = 393), with a follow-up period of between 0 and 69 months. To this end, a survival analysis was conducted using four sets of variables: individual-level, relational- and contextual-level, violence-related, and intervention process-related variables. To include all variables in the analysis simultaneously, a Cox regression model was estimated with the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (ALASSO). From a pool of eighty-nine variables, six were selected as key predictors of recidivism: dropout, risk of future violence against non-partners, family violence exposure, immigrant status, accumulation of stressful life events, and trait anger. The area under the receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve was .808, indicating good prediction of the model. The key predictors of recidivism found in this study should be considered by professionals and researchers in the BIP field to improve their evaluation and intervention strategies.

"Evaluation of a newly modified nonflared fully covered metal stent, 12 mm in diameter, for intraductal placement in patients with malignant biliary strictures: a feasibility study.","BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM
The nonflared ends of fully covered, self-expandable, metal stents (FCSEMSs) may minimize stent-induced ductal injury. Suprapapillary intraductal placement of nonflared FCSEMSs for malignant biliary stricture might reduce duodenobiliary reflux and pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a newly modified, nonflared FCSEMS for intraductal placement in patients with malignant biliary stricture.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
A total of 51 patients with nonhilar, extrahepatic, malignant biliary stricture were enrolled prospectively. The nonflared FCSEMS is 12â€Šmm in diameter, and has a central saddle and a distal lasso of 7â€Šcm in length. An FCSEMS was placed above the papilla in all patients, with the central saddle positioned at the stricture to prevent stent migration.


RESULTS
The technical and clinical success rates were 100â€Š% and 98â€Š%, respectively. Early adverse events occurred in one patient (2.0â€Š%; mild pancreatitis). A total of 12 patients underwent surgery with curative intent, one of whom (8.3â€Š%) experienced a postoperative adverse event. No stent migration occurred in any of the patients. Cholecystitis developed in one patient (2.0â€Š%) as a late adverse event. Stent occlusion occurred in 44.7â€Š% (17/38), and endoscopic removal of the stent was successful in 87.5â€Š% of patients. The mean stent patency was 297 days (95â€Š% confidence interval, 211â€Š-â€Š383).


CONCLUSIONS
Intraductal placement of the nonflared FCSEMS, 12â€Šmm in diameter, was feasible for the palliative and preoperative management of patients with malignant biliary stricture. Long-term follow-up and prospective comparative studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of intraductal placement of this stent.",2016,Endoscopy
Compressive Sensing of Signals from a GMM with Sparse Precision Matrices,"This paper is concerned with compressive sensing of signals drawn from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with sparse precision matrices. Previous work has shown: (i) a signal drawn from a given GMM can be perfectly reconstructed from r noise-free measurements if the (dominant) rank of each covariance matrix is less than r; (ii) a sparse Gaussian graphical model can be efficiently estimated from fully-observed training signals using graphical lasso. This paper addresses a problem more challenging than both (i) and (ii), by assuming that the GMM is unknown and each signal is only observed through incomplete linear measurements. Under these challenging assumptions, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian method to simultaneously estimate the GMM and recover the signals using solely the incomplete measurements and a Bayesian shrinkage prior that promotes sparsity of the Gaussian precision matrices. In addition, we provide theoretical performance bounds to relate the reconstruction error to the number of signals for which measurements are available, the sparsity level of precision matrices, and the ""incompleteness"" of measurements. The proposed method is demonstrated extensively on compressive sensing of imagery and video, and the results with simulated and hardware-acquired real measurements show significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",2014,
Generalization of learned predator recognition in coral reef ecosystems: how cautious are damselfish?,"Summary 
 
Learned predator recognition provides animals with an adaptive mechanism to rapidly adapt to current levels of predation risk. Prey may be able to reduce the cost associated with learning if they can use information learned about known predators to respond to cues from closely related predators with which they are unfamiliar. 
 
 
The capacity of prey to generalize recognition and distinguish between novel predators and non-predators is poorly understood, particularly in species-diverse communities with many closely related predators and non-predators. 
 
 
Lemon damselfish, Pomacentrus moluccensis, conditioned to recognize the odour of a predatory moon wrasse, Thalassoma lunare, as a risky stimulus, were subsequently tested for their response to T.Â lunare and a range of closely related predators and non-predators from within the Labridae family, a distantly related non-predator and a saltwater control. 
 
 
Pomacentrus moluccensis displayed antipredator responses not only to T.Â lunare odour, but also generalized their recognition to congeneric T.Â amblycephalum and T.Â hardwicke odours. Recognition was not extended to other species within (Labridae; Coris batuensis and Halichoeres melanurus) or beyond (Pseudochromidae; Pseudochromis fuscus) the family. Individuals could not distinguish between the predator T.Â hardwicke and non-predator T.Â amblycephalum when generalizing their recognition to congeneric species based on chemosensory assessment alone. 
 
 
Our results demonstrate that reef fishes may limit their generalization to congeneric species only, and may be unable to distinguish between predators and non-predators using chemosensory cues. Recognition patterns may result from uncertainties in predicting the identities of predators in species-diverse communities.",2013,Functional Ecology
Knowledge Table Driven Ontology Enhancement,"Our system enhances a consistent OWL ontology by adding new concept and property definitions, if they are found consistent with the existing ontology. New restrictions are allowed to be posed on existing concepts. But, no changes are allowed on existing restrictions. We build a knowledge table from the ontology to be enhanced, to determine the consistency of an input submission. Knowledge table is a two dimensional table, each row of which corresponds to a concept in the ontology. Each column corresponds to a property restriction appearing as property flavor, a combination of property, restriction and value. The cell values in knowledge table could be {1},{0} or {0,1} depending on whether the property flavor is true, false or not applicable for a concept. This table intuitively stores property restrictions applicable to concepts in the ontology. Interactions between property flavors are captured in another data structure called influence tables. The influence tables take into account the effect of disjointness between ranges of property flavors and the functional characteristic of a property. The knowledge table describes a concept in terms all property flavors that appear in the ontology by updating cell values as per the influence table. Our knowledge table is built on the assumption that concept descriptions do not contain more than one value and one cardinality restrictions. Although we have tried to incorporate interactions introduced by role inclusions and inverse proprieties, we need to consider interactions due to the presence of a multiple value and cardinality restrictions. Knowledge table helps us to check the subClassOf and disjoint relationship between concepts directly. Ontology enhancement algorithm constructs the knowledge table, considering the concepts hierarchically. A new restriction on existing classes is accepted if it matches the respective concept description in knowledge table. Building a row in the knowledge table with respect to a concept fails, if any operation requires either a {0} or a {1} to be flipped. More details are given in technical report [1].

Network-based group variable selection for detecting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL),"BackgroundAnalysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) aims to identify the genetic loci associated with the expression level of genes. Penalized regression with a proper penalty is suitable for the high-dimensional biological data. Its performance should be enhanced when we incorporate biological knowledge of gene expression network and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure between loci in high-noise background.ResultsWe propose a network-based group variable selection (NGVS) method for QTL detection. Our method simultaneously maps highly correlated expression traits sharing the same biological function to marker sets formed by LD. By grouping markers, complex joint activity of multiple SNPs can be considered and the dimensionality of eQTL problem is reduced dramatically. In order to demonstrate the power and flexibility of our method, we used it to analyze two simulations and a mouse obesity and diabetes dataset. We considered the gene co-expression network, grouped markers into marker sets and treated the additive and dominant effect of each locus as a group: as a consequence, we were able to replicate results previously obtained on the mouse linkage dataset. Furthermore, we observed several possible sex-dependent loci and interactions of multiple SNPs.ConclusionsThe proposed NGVS method is appropriate for problems with high-dimensional data and high-noise background. On eQTL problem it outperforms the classical Lasso method, which does not consider biological knowledge. Introduction of proper gene expression and loci correlation information makes detecting causal markers more accurate. With reasonable model settings, NGVS can lead to novel biological findings.",2010,BMC Bioinformatics
Sparse generalized volterra model of human hippocampal spike train transformation for memory prostheses,"In order to build hippocampal prostheses for restoring memory functions, we build multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear dynamical models of the human hippocampus. Spike trains are recorded from the hippocampal CA3 and CA1 regions of epileptic patients performing a memory-dependent delayed match-to-sample task. Using CA3 and CA1 spike trains as inputs and outputs respectively, second-order sparse generalized Laguerre-Volterra models are estimated with group lasso and local coordinate descent methods to capture the nonlinear dynamics underlying the spike train transformations. These models can accurately predict the CA1 spike trains based on the ongoing CA3 spike trains and thus will serve as the computational basis of the hippocampal memory prosthesis.",2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
Danshen can interact with intestinal bacteria from normal and chronic renal failure rats.,"Danshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, SMR) has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine in clinic for treatment of coronary heart diseases. Previous works have shown that the chronic renal failure (CRF) is closely related to changes of intestinal bacteria. The aim is to explore the interaction between active components of SMR and intestinal bacteria from normal and CRF rats. The changes of intestinal bacteria were evaluated among normal rats, CRF model rats and SMR-treated rats via 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. UPLC-QTOF/MS was applied for the analysis and identification of metabolites. RESULTS: Results showed that the following intestinal bacteria varied significantly in CRF rats, including Mucispirillum, Kurthia, Clostridium, Blautia, Butyrivibrio, Shuttleworthia, Peptococcus, Ruminococcus, Bradyrhizobium, Methylobacterium, Azospirillum, Thalassospira, Methylophilus, Pseudomonas, peptostreptococcaceae and bacteroidales. The ethanol extract of SMR (DS) significantly regulated Shuttleworthia, peptostreptococcaceae and Pseudomonas, while the water extract (DSS) significantly affected Peptococcus, peptostreptococcaceae and Ruminococcus. Methylation, demethylation, dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and hydroxylation were the major metabolic transformation of tanshinones in vitro by intestinal bacteria. Glucuronidation, methylation and hydrogenation were the main metabolic transformation of salvianolic acids. These results showed that the bioactive components of SMR, including tanshinones and salvianolic acids, might exert the medical effect via regulation intestinal bacteria.",2019,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie
Dan Brayton. Shakespeare's Ocean: An Ecological Exploration,"Dan Brayton. Shakespeare's Ocean: An Ecological Exploration. U Virginia P, 2012.257 pages.Dan Brayton, the co-editor of Ecocritical Shakespeare, seeks to combine popular literary scholarship with ecology in Shakespeare's Ocean: An Ecocritical Exploration. Brayton's Shakespeare is a mainstream cultural force of nature to be harnessed in the service of environmentalism: ""by Shakespeare I mean not just a historical personage possessed of unparalleled poetic ability but also a cultural 'text that continues to be decoded and produced in new ways'"" (4; emphasis original; the quotation is from his own prior work). Brayton's ocean is a metaphor for Shakespeare: wild, chaotic, richly playful, and considered sublime but really vulnerable to human agency. Brayton detangles myth and reality to demonstrate the unusually human, familiarized nature of Shakespeare's ocean, or more accurately Shakespeare's oceans, supporting the environmentalist argument.Brayton offers a valuable original contribution to Shakespearean studies, especially in such chapters as ""Prospero's Maps"" and ""Royal Fish: Shakespeare's Princely Whales."" The introduction and conclusion are broader and mostly ecological in scope, using present-day popular culture's fascination with Shakespeare to argue for present-day environmental consciousness, ""a strategic presentism"" (5). Each chapter then mingles a present-day ecological discussion with wide-ranging historical cultural context and a more detailed approach to Shakespearean texts.Brayton describes Macbeth's line ""No, this my hand will rather / The multitudinous seas incarnadine, / Making the green one red"" (65-66) as an example of human agency affecting the global ocean: ""the immensity and indifference of the sea are invoked by outcast characters who have sunk to the depths"" (73). Macbeth's line places Shakespeare's ""green"" ocean within the existing field of ""green"" or environmental literary studies. Brayton contrasts the colors of the green land of present ecocriticism with the blue ocean of his proposed additional emphasis. Throughout the book, he tests a playful array of possible names for his new field, including blue cultural studies, thalassology, terraqueous ecocriticism, maritime Shakespeare, oceanic subjectivity, a benthic imagination, and even ""splashing blue water onto literary scholarship"" (19).In the first chapter, ""Backs to the Sea? The Terrestrial Bias,"" Brayton covers broad ecological ground in Western literature and science. He sets forth a core argument of the book, an ancient and more recently Romantic mythos of the ocean as an alien void untouchable by human actions. He surveys the development of this widespread mythos from Hesiod to Thomas Henry Huxley to present-day environmental disasters. This mythos has excused human greed and plunder, but Shakespeare, among a few others, is stated to have questioned or undercut it.The second chapter, ""Consider the Crab,"" moves to the borderline between ocean and land, ecocriticism and ecopolitics. Brayton is careful to keep clear distinctions between his present-day environmental discussion and his early modern era, while at the same time arguing that Shakespeare has much to teach us in terms of understanding our relation to the ocean. The chapter focuses on coastal dynamics and invasive species in The Tempest, metaphorically in terms of colonialism but also discussing Ariel's ditty, Caliban as ""sand-dwelling (and beachcombing) merman"" (57), and Caliban's ""crabs"" that may be crustaceans or apples. Just as ocean and land co-exist in a complex, undeniable association, so do human and nonhuman.The argument of the third chapter, ""Shakespeare's Benthic Imagination,"" is somewhat complicated by the inescapable fact of the era's ignorance of the seafloor: ""Shakepeare's poetic attempts to measure the depths produced - instead of technological innovations useful to mariners - vivid evocations of the depths of the human and the humanity of the depths"" (81). â€¦",2013,Style
Feature Extractions from a High-dimension Low-samples Data for Multi-dimension Virtual Metrology,"This paper discussed the virtual metrology (VM) modelling of multi-dimensional multi classes to describe the relationship between the variables of a production machine's condition of and the estimated/forecasted product quality soon after finishing the machine processing. Combination of the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) technique of the sparse modelling were introduced to define the multi-dimensional quality. Because the high accuracy and quick computations are required for the VM modelling, in this study, the PCA-LASSO combination was applied before building the VM models based on the kernel SVM (kSVM), particularly the linear kernel for real-time use. Those usefulness was evaluated by three different data sets; a CVD (Chemical vapor deposition) process in an actual semiconductor factory, an open-data of higher dimension which is measured in a chemical process, and a scalable data which is generated by using a multivariate normal random numbers based on the original CVD data. We will investigate versatility of the proposed method.",2019,2019 Joint International Symposium on e-Manufacturing & Design Collaboration(eMDC) & Semiconductor Manufacturing (ISSM)
SU-F-R-24: Identifying Prognostic Imaging Biomarkers in Early Stage Lung Cancer Using Radiomics.,"PURPOSE
Patients diagnosed with early stage lung cancer have favorable outcomes when treated with surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy. However, a significant proportion (âˆ¼20%) of patients will develop metastatic disease and eventually die of the disease. The purpose of this work is to identify quantitative imaging biomarkers from CT for predicting overall survival in early stage lung cancer.


METHODS
In this institutional review board-approved HIPPA-compliant retrospective study, we retrospectively analyzed the diagnostic CT scans of 110 patients with early stage lung cancer. Data from 70 patients were used for training/discovery purposes, while those of remaining 40 patients were used for independent validation. We extracted 191 radiomic features, including statistical, histogram, morphological, and texture features. Cox proportional hazard regression model, coupled with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), was used to predict overall survival based on the radiomic features.


RESULTS
The optimal prognostic model included three image features from the Law's feature and wavelet texture. In the discovery cohort, this model achieved a concordance index or CI=0.67, and it separated the low-risk from high-risk groups in predicting overall survival (hazard ratio=2.72, log-rank p=0.007). In the independent validation cohort, this radiomic signature achieved a CI=0.62, and significantly stratified the low-risk and high-risk groups in terms of overall survival (hazard ratio=2.20, log-rank p=0.042).


CONCLUSION
We identified CT imaging characteristics associated with overall survival in early stage lung cancer. If prospectively validated, this could potentially help identify high-risk patients who might benefit from adjuvant systemic therapy.",2016,Medical physics
[CERPOD intensifies its support to national health programs].,"
 The Center for Studies and Research on Population for Development (CERPOD) first supported studies of infant mortality in the Sahel. It then became and is still engaged in strengthening service delivery of national maternal and child health services and family planning (MCH/FP) services. CERPOD's Family Planning Division heads up MCH/FP program support activities. CERPOD joined with regional and international institutions involved in population and public health research, allowing the rapid creation of a technical and scientific base to support all member states. All CERPOD projects have direct or indirect reference to the collection, analysis, and use of health data. CERPOD'S second phase involves focusing on 5 areas to effect improved living and health conditions. These areas include sensitization activities for decision makers and for population and health officials, training, studies and research, development of information systems for management of programs (e.g., Gambia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde), and design, follow-up, and evaluation of programs and of projects (e.g., Niger, Mali, Senegal, Cape Verde, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau). In 1991, CERPOD hosted a seminar in Bobo-Dioulasso between leaders of the MCH/FP program and those of national midwife associations from 8 African countries to sensitize them to their responsibility to multidisciplinary actions to expand and improve the quality of MCH/FP care. In September 1989, participants from 13 African countries received training in use of the model on integration of demographic variables in socioeconomic planning and models relating to health and family planning. CERPOD is conducting thorough analyses of the Demographic and Health Survey data for Mali and Senegal to examine micro-effects of high fertility on child survival, morbidity, and well-being.

Influence of grain type on the efficacy of some formulations of diatomaceous earth against the rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae L.).,"The paper aimed to present the effect of grain type on the insecticidal efficacy of the diatomaceous earth (DE) formulations, applied on wheat, barley, maize and paddy rice against adults of the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae L. The formulations used in the bioassays were two local DEs deposits from Romania (Buzï¿½ï¿½ u Valey-Pï¿½ï¿½ tÃ¢rlagele and South of Dobroudja-Adamclisi), two from Greece (Elassona region) and two comercial products (SilicoSec and PyriSec). The bioassays were done in laboratory conditions set at 25 o C and 60Â±5%relative humidity in 3 series with 3 replicates. The DEs were applied at the dose rates of 100, 300, 500 and 900 ppm (mg DE per Kg of grain), while mortality of the exposed adults was recorded after 7, 14 and 21 days of exposure. Among the tested DEs, the most effective of all, was the commercial formulation of PyriSec witch manage to total control the adults of S. oryzae in half of the tested grains (wheat and maize) after 7 days of exposure in dose rates above 100 ppm. Between the tested grains, DEs were most effective when applied on wheat and totally ineffective on paddy rice. Furthermore for wheat, the two DEs from Romania and one from Greece (Elassona 1), at the highest dose rate, had the same high performance with the commercial formulation of SilicoSec, while for the other grains all of the no commercial DEs was ineffective and performed the same with SilicoSec formulation. These findings lead us to conclude that our no commercial DEs are competitive with the SilicoSec formulation, and can sufficient protect wheat in doses above 900 ppm.",2014,
"Phylogenetic relationships among marine Alteromonas-like proteobacteria: emended description of the family Alteromonadaceae and proposal of Pseudoalteromonadaceae fam. nov., Colwelliaceae fam. nov., Shewanellaceae fam. nov., Moritellaceae fam. nov., Ferrimonadaceae fam. nov., Idiomarinaceae fam. nov","The phylogenetic relationships among marine Alteromonas-like bacteria of the genera Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Glaciecola, Thalassomonas, Colwellia, Idiomarina, Oceanimonas, Oceanisphaera, Shewanella, Moritella, Ferrimonas, Psychromonas and several other genera of the 'Gammaproteobacteria' were studied. Results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses revealed that some members of these genera formed several coherent groups at the family level. Characteristic signature oligonucleotides for studied taxa were defined. Signature positions are divided into three classes: (i) single compensatory mutations, (ii) double compensatory mutations and (iii) mutations affecting nucleotides not paired in the secondary structure. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity level within genera was 93 % or above. This value can be a useful additional criterion for genus discrimination. On the basis of this work and previous polyphasic taxonomic studies, the circumscription of the family Alteromonadaceae is limited to the genera Alteromonas and Glaciecola and the creation is proposed of the families Pseudoalteromonadaceae fam. nov. to accommodate bacteria of the genera Pseudoalteromonas and Algicola gen. nov. (formerly Pseudoalteromonas bacteriolytica) and Colwelliaceae fam. nov. to accommodate bacteria of the genera Colwellia and Thalassomonas. Bacteria of the genera Oceanimonas and Oceanisphaera formed a robust cluster and shared common signature oligonucleotides. Because of deep branching and lack of association with any other genus, the following families are proposed that include single genera: Idiomarinaceae fam. nov., Psychromonadaceae fam. nov., Moritellaceae fam. nov., Ferrimonadaceae fam. nov. and Shewanellaceae fam. nov. Finally, this study also revealed that [Hyphomicrobium] indicum should be reclassified as Photobacterium indicum comb. nov.",2004,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
"Recursive l(sub 1, infinity) Group lasso","Abstract : We introduce a recursive adaptive group lasso algorithm for real-time penalized least squares prediction that produces a time sequence of optimal sparse predictor coefficient vectors. At each time index the proposed algorithm computes an exact update of the optimal L(sub 1, infinity)-penalized recursive least squares (RLS) predictor. Each update minimizes a convex but nondifferentiable function optimization problem. We develop an online homotopy method to reduce the computational complexity. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the l(sub 1) regularized RLS algorithm for a group sparse system identification problem and has lower implementation complexity than direct group lasso solvers.",2012,
"A Review of: â€œPharmaceutical Statistics Using SAS: A Practical Guide, by A. Dmitrienko, C. Chuang-Stein, and R. B. D'Agostino (eds.)â€","In their preface, the editors cite the significant developments in biostatistical methodology over the past decades that have lead to improvements in many areas of drug discovery and development. The objective of this book is to provide broad coverage of biostatistical methodology applied in the pharmaceutical industry to deal with practical problems. The focus is primarily on nonclinical and preclinical research and early development although there is some discussion of nonstandard topics in later development as well. The target audience of the book includes primarily biostatisticians engaged in pharmaceutical research and development, but it could also benefit basic scientists such as biologists and chemists as well as pharmacologists and pharmacokineticists. The book is organized into 14 chapters written by 42 authors (26 from the pharmaceutical industry, 13 academic, 2 nonpharmaceutical industry, and 1 government). Chapter 1 provides an overview of the role of the statistician in the pharmaceutical industry, describing activities in nonclinical, early, and late clinical development. The emerging opportunities for statisticians to demonstrate leadership in the Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s Critical Path Initiative are also described. Chapter 2 describes two modern classification methods used in drug discovery, namely boosting and partial least squares. The authors note that drug discovery is typically characterized by overspecified data, i.e., too many variables relative to the number of observations and/or highly correlated descriptors. Recursive partitioning followed by boosting (implemented using two author-supplied macros) and partial least squares linear discrimination analysis (using PROC PLS) are illustrated using a permeability data set. In Chapter 3, the authors observe that a series of optimization processes takes place after a basic skeletal structure having the desired target inhibition and activity is discovered. These processes investigate modification of the chemical structure to improve the pharmaceutical properties (e.g., solubility, permeability, etc,) of the drug. Statistical modeling of the pharmaceutical properties as a function of the chemical structure is a driving factor of the optimization process. Model building and variable selection using multiple linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, logistic regression, and discriminant analysis are discussed and illustrated, using a solubility data set. Chapter 4 discusses analytical method validation related to biological and/or chemical assays. The authors use the proposed classification of assay data by Lee",2008,Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics
Maneuverability of four species of coral-reef fish that differ in body and pectoral-fin morphology,"Maneuverability was measured during feeding and agonistic interactions in four sympatric species of coral-reef fish differing in body and pectoral-fin morphology: foureye butterflyfish, Chaetodon capistratus (deep body, low aspect ratio (AR) fins), beaugregory damselfish, Stegastes leucostictus (medium-depth body, low AR fins), ocean surgeonfish, Acanthurus bahanieusis (medium-depth body, high AR fins), and bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum (slender body, high AR fins). Damselfish turned faster, using median- and paired-fin propulsion, than either surgeonfish or wrasse, but their performance did not differ from that of butterflyfish during maneuvering behaviours common to all species. Each of these pairs had similar pectoral-fin morphology but exhibited an intermediate body morphology. This suggests that pectoral-fin morphology was more important in determining performance within maneuvers, and therefore butterflyfish and damselfish were superior maneuverers to surgeonfish or wrasse. To turn faster,...",1999,Canadian Journal of Zoology
Biometrics on visual preferences: A â€œpump and distillâ€ regression approach,"We present a statistical behavioural biometric approach for recognizing people by their aesthetic preferences, using colour images. In the enrollment phase, a model is learnt for each user, using a training set of preferred images. In the recognition/authentication phase, such model is tested with an unseen set of pictures preferred by a probe subject. The approach is dubbed â€œpump and distillâ€, since the training set of each user is pumped by bagging, producing a set of image ensembles. In the distill step, each ensemble is reduced into a set of surrogates, that is, aggregates of images sharing a similar visual content. Finally, LASSO regression is performed on these surrogates; the resulting regressor, employed as a classifier, takes test images belonging to a single user, predicting his identity. The approach improves the state-of-the-art on recognition and authentication tasks in average, on a dataset of 40000 Flickr images and 200 users. In practice, given a pool of 20 preferred images of a user, the approach recognizes his identity with an accuracy of 92%, and sets an authentication accuracy of 91% in terms of normalized Area Under the Curve of the CMC and ROC curve, respectively.",2014,2014 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)
Time-lagged Ordered Lasso for network inference,"BackgroundAccurate gene regulatory networks can be used to explain the emergence of different phenotypes, disease mechanisms, and other biological functions. Many methods have been proposed to infer networks from gene expression data but have been hampered by problems such as low sample size, inaccurate constraints, and incomplete characterizations of regulatory dynamics. Since expression regulation is dynamic, time-course data can be used to infer causality, but these datasets tend to be short or sparsely sampled. In addition, temporal methods typically assume that the expression of a gene at a time point depends on the expression of other genes at only the immediately preceding time point, while other methods include additional time points without any constraints to account for their temporal distance. These limitations can contribute to inaccurate networks with many missing and anomalous links.ResultsWe adapted the time-lagged Ordered Lasso, a regularized regression method with temporal monotonicity constraints, for de novo reconstruction. We also developed a semi-supervised method that embeds prior network information into the Ordered Lasso to discover novel regulatory dependencies in existing pathways. R code is available at https://github.com/pn51/laggedOrderedLassoNetwork.ConclusionsWe evaluated these approaches on simulated data for a repressilator, time-course data from past DREAM challenges, and a HeLa cell cycle dataset to show that they can produce accurate networks subject to the dynamics and assumptions of the time-lagged Ordered Lasso regression.",2018,BMC Bioinformatics
Dissimilatory nitrogen reduction in intertidal sediments of a temperate estuary: small scale heterogeneity and novel nitrate-to-ammonium reducers,"The estuarine nitrogen cycle can be substantially altered due to anthropogenic activities resulting in increased amounts of inorganic nitrogen (mainly nitrate). In the past, denitrification was considered to be the main ecosystem process removing reactive nitrogen from the estuarine ecosystem. However, recent reports on the contribution of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) to nitrogen removal in these systems indicated a similar or higher importance, although the ratio between both processes remains ambiguous. Compared to denitrification, DNRA has been underexplored for the last decades and the key organisms carrying out the process in marine environments are largely unknown. Hence, as a first step to better understand the interplay between denitrification, DNRA and reduction of nitrate to nitrite in estuarine sediments, nitrogen reduction potentials were determined in sediments of the Paulina polder mudflat (Westerschelde estuary). We observed high variability in dominant nitrogen removing processes over a short distance (1.6 m), with nitrous oxide, ammonium and nitrite production rates differing significantly between all sampling sites. Denitrification occurred at all sites, DNRA was either the dominant process (two out of five sites) or absent, while nitrate reduction to nitrite was observed in most sites but never dominant. In addition, novel nitrate-to-ammonium reducers assigned to Thalassospira, Celeribacter, and Halomonas, for which DNRA was thus far unreported, were isolated, with DNRA phenotype reconfirmed through nrfA gene amplification. This study demonstrates high small scale heterogeneity among dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes in estuarine sediments and provides novel marine DNRA organisms that represent valuable alternatives to the current model organisms.",2015,Frontiers in Microbiology
Sparse Artificial Neural Networks Using a Novel Smoothed LASSO Penalization,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are increasingly being used for a variety of machine learning problems. However, increased density of interconnections in ANNs leads to high computational and power requirements. One way to reduce the power is to reduce the number of interconnections which can be achieved using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) techniques. In this brief, we propose an alternative smoothing function to LASSO regularization and an incremental pruning algorithm on feedforward ANNs with an aim of achieving maximally sparse networks with minimal performance degradation. We compare the results obtained using the proposed smoothing function with the existing smoothing functions. Further, we also evaluate the performance of the proposed incremental pruning algorithm.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs
Shore-based biomarkers allow patient versus control classification in stroke,"In diffusion MRI, numerical biomarkers are usually calculated for research and clinical purposes as Generalized Fractional Anisotropy (GFA). Recently, more eloquent indices allowing a more accurate description of tissue microstructure were derived from the SHORE model. Under certain experimental conditions, such indices express the morphological properties of the compartments where spins diffuse. Evidence of the suitability of such indices as biomarkers for stroke was provided in a previous study based on diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) and focusing on the cortical motor loop. The goal of this work was to investigate the suitability of such indices for stratification, namely for distinguishing pathological from healthy subjects. To this end, two different paths were followed. First, the same approach used in the previous work for longitudinal analysis (statistics-based) was applied to detect inter-group variations. Then, a new approach based on the LASSO regressor was proposed. Results provided evidence of the suitability of the proposed indices for stratification purposes.",2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)
Classification of failure mode and prediction of shear strength for reinforced concrete beam-column joints using machine learning techniques,"Abstract Beam-column joints are one of critical components that control the oveerall performance of reinforced concrete building frames under seismic loadings. To identify the response mechanism, including the classification of failure mode and the prediction of associated shear strength, of beam-column joints, this paper introduces the application of machine learning techniques. The efficiency of various machine learning techniques is evaluated using extensive experimental data from 536 experimental tests, all of which exhibited either non-ductile joint shear failure prior to beam yielding or ductile joint shear failure after beam yielding. It has been seen from the comparison that lasso regression has a better efficiency and reasonable accuracy in the classification and prediction. The suggested formulations as a function of influential input variables can be easily used by structural engineers to provide an optimal rehabilitation strategy for existing buildings and to design new structures.",2018,Engineering Structures
Matching a Distribution by Matching Quantiles Estimation,"Motivated by the problem of selecting representative portfolios for backtesting counterparty credit risks, we propose a matching quantiles estimation (MQE) method for matching a target distribution by that of a linear combination of a set of random variables. An iterative procedure based on the ordinary least-squares estimation (OLS) is proposed to compute MQE. MQE can be easily modified by adding a LASSO penalty term if a sparse representation is desired, or by restricting the matching within certain range of quantiles to match a part of the target distribution. The convergence of the algorithm and the asymptotic properties of the estimation, both with or without LASSO, are established. A measure and an associated statistical test are proposed to assess the goodness-of-match. The finite sample properties are illustrated by simulation. An application in selecting a counterparty representative portfolio with a real dataset is reported. The proposed MQE also finds applications in portfolio tracking, which demonstrates the usefulness of combining MQE with LASSO.",2015,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Abstract LB-139: Prognostic value of a BCSC-associated microRNA signature in hormone receptor-positive her2-negative breast cancer,"Background: Breast cancer patients with high proportion of cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are more chemotherapy-resistant and have unfavorable clinical outcomes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, which regulate key features of BCSCs. Since BCSCs have unique miRNA expression profile, we hypothesized that a biology-driven model based on BCSC-associated miRNAs could provide prognostic information for low recurrent-risk HR+HER2- breast cancer patients. Methods: A systematic literature reviewing suggested 50 BCSC-associated miRNAs that regulate the BCSC features. We excluded 15 of these miRNAs as they were not constantly detectable in the 40 paraffin embedded tumor samples by qRT-PCR (A pilot assay). A total of 35 BCSC-associated miRNAs were identified. We randomly assigned 303 patients into a training group (n = 202) and an internal validation (n = 101) group. We built a 10-miRNA-based classifier using a LASSO Cox model in the training group and validated its prognostic in the internal validation group, and two external independent groups of 308 patients. Results: In this multicenter study, we developed build a 10-miRNA classifier to predict disease-relapse free survival (DRFS). With this classifier, HR+HER2- breast cancer patients were classified into high-risk and low-risk group of diseases recurrence. The DFS was significantly different between these two groups in all of the patient groups. In the training group, the 5-year DRFS was 90.83% and 35.0% for the low-risk and the high-risk group, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 15.85, 95% CI 8.15-30.82; p Interpretation: Our 10-miRNA-based classifier provides a reliable prognostic model for disease recurrence in HR+HER2- breast cancer patients. This classifier may facilitate patient counseling and serve in personalized treatment for breast cancer patients.

"Comparative Genomics of Thalassobius Including the Description of Thalassobius activus sp. nov., and Thalassobius autumnalis sp. nov.","A taxogenomic study was conducted to describe two new Thalassobius species and to analyze the internal consistency of the genus Thalassobius along with Shimia and Thalassococcus. Strains CECT 5113T, CECT 5114, CECT 5118T, and CECT 5120 were isolated from coastal Mediterranean seawater, Spain. Cells were Gram-negative, non- motile coccobacilli, aerobic chemoorganotrophs, with an optimum temperature of 26Â°C and salinity of 3.5-5%. Major cellular fatty acids of strains CECT 5113T and CECT 5114 were C18 : 1 Ï‰7c/Ï‰6c and C10 : 0 3OH, G+C content was 54.4-54.5 mol% and were able to utilize propionate, L-threonine, L- arginine, and L-aspartate as carbon sources. They exhibited 98.3% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 75.0-75.1 ANIb and 19.5-20.9 digital DDH to type strain of their closest species, Thalassobius maritimus. Based on these data, strains CECT 5113T and CECT 5114 are recognized as a new species, for which the name Thalassobius activus is proposed, with strain CECT 5113T (=LMG 29900T) as type strain. Strains CECT 5118T and CECT 5120 were found to constitute another new species, with major cellular fatty acids C18 : 1 Ï‰7c/Ï‰6c and C18 : 1 Ï‰7c 11-methyl and a G+C content of 59.8 mol%; they were not able to utilize propionate, L-threonine, L- arginine or L-aspartate. Their closest species was Thalassobius mediterraneus, with values of 99.6% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 79.1% ANIb and 23.2% digital DDH compared to the type strain, CECT 5383T. The name Thalassobius autumnalis is proposed for this second new species, with strain CECT 5118T (=LMG 29904T) as type strain. To better determine the phylogenetic relationship of the two new species, we submitted 12 genomes representing species of Thalassobius, Shimia, and Thalassoccocus, to a phylogenomic analysis based on 54 single protein-encoding genes (BCG54). The resulting phylogenomic tree did not agree with the current genera classification, as Thalassobius was divided in three clades, Thalassobius sensu stricto (T. mediterraneus, T. autumnalis sp. nov., and T. gelatinovorus), Thalassobius aestuarii plus the three Shimia spp (S. marina, S. haliotis, and Shimia sp.

"Lasso Logistic Regression, GSoft and the Cyclic Coordinate Descent Algorithm: Application to Gene Expression Data","Statistical methods generating sparse models are of great value in the gene expression field, where the number of covariates (genes) under study moves about the thousands while the sample sizes seldom reach a hundred of individuals. For phenotype classification, we propose different lasso logistic regression approaches with specific penalizations for each gene. These methods are based on a generalized soft-threshold (GSoft) estimator. We also show that a recent algorithm for convex optimization, namely, the cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) algorithm, provides with a way to solve the optimization problem significantly faster than with other competing methods. Viewing GSoft as an iterative thresholding procedure allows us to get the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimates in a straightforward manner. Results are obtained for simulated and real data. The leukemia and colon datasets are commonly used to evaluate new statistical approaches, so they come in useful to establish comparisons with similar methods. Furthermore, biological meaning is extracted from the leukemia results, and compared with previous studies. In summary, the approaches presented here give rise to sparse, interpretable models that are competitive with similar methods developed in the field.",2010,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
Temporal transferability of stream fish distribution models: can uncalibrated SDMs predict distribution shifts over time?,"Aim 
We aim to assess the temporary transferability of species distribution models (SDMs) for stream fish species in terms of discrimination power and calibration. 
 
Location 
New River basin, eastern United States. 
 
Methods 
In this study, we used Lasso-regularized logistic regression (LLR), boosted regression trees (BRT), MaxEnt, and ensemble model (ENS) to evaluate the habitat suitability of 16 fish species with different rarity and temperature preference based on historical species occurrences obtained during 1950â€“1990. These SDMs were used to make probabilistic predictions of species presence in the independent datasets sampled during 2012â€“2014. We evaluated the temporal transferability of these SDMs in terms of discrimination power and calibration with the temporarily independent datasets. 
 
Results 
The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) was over 0.6 for 13 (81%) of the species in the evaluations of ENS models with the independent datasets. Cool-water species and species with small local population size traits tended to have good temporal transferability. With observed species prevalence as the discrimination cut-off, LLR had the highest overall accuracy for 13 of the 16 species and highest specificity for 10 species, whereas MaxEnt had the highest sensitivity for 14 species. Biases, under- or over-fitting problems were common in the temporal model transfers, among the modelling approaches used here. 
 
Main conclusions 
SDMs developed with historical data generally had moderate to good discrimination power but they tended to systematically underestimate current probability of species presence. To predict species distribution shifts over time, SDMs should be well-calibrated with high discrimination power. We suggest reclassifying predicted probability of species occurrence to ordinal ranks to deal with (under- and over-estimation) bias, and fine-tuning variable selection with regularization or cross validation to remedy under- and over-fitting.",2016,Diversity and Distributions
Combining temporal and content aware features for microblog retrieval,"Microblog, especially Twitter, have become an integral part of our daily life for searching latest news and events information. Due to short length characteristics of tweets, only content-relevance based search result cannot satisfy user's information need. Recent research shows that considering temporal aspects in this regard improve the retrieval performance significantly. In this paper, we propose a method to re-rank the search result based on temporal features, account related features, and Twitter specific features along with textual features of tweets. We also applied a two stage query expansion technique to improve the relevancy of tweets. After automatic feature selection by using LASSO and elastic-net regularization; we applied random forest as a feature ranking method to estimate the importance of selected feature. Then, with that importance score, a weighted ranking model combines the features value to estimate the relevance score. We conducted our experiments based on the TREC Microblog 2011 and 2012 queries over the TREC Tweets2011 collection. Experimental result demonstrates the effectiveness of our method over the baseline in terms of precision@30 (P@30), mean average precision (MAP), and reciprocal-precision (R-Prec) metrics.",2015,"2015 2nd International Conference on Advanced Informatics: Concepts, Theory and Applications (ICAICTA)"
Robust inference of gene regulatory networks from multiple microarray datasets,"Multiple time-course microarray datasets with the same underlying gene network are collected from different experiments. The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) can be improved by integrating these datasets. Microarray data may be contaminated with large errors or outliers, which may affect the inference results. A novel method, Huber group LASSO, is proposed to reconstruct the GRNs from multiple datasets as well as taking the robustness into account. To solve the optimization problem involved in the proposed method, an efficient algorithm which combines the ideas of auxiliary function minimization and block coordinate descent is developed. Simulations and real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the group LASSO method and is able to reconstruct reasonably good GRNs from multiple datasets even the number of genes exceeds the number of observations.",2013,2013 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine
Radiomics analysis of pulmonary nodules in lowâ€dose CT for early detection of lung cancer,"PURPOSE
To develop a radiomics prediction model to improve pulmonary nodule (PN) classification in low-dose CT. To compare the model with the American College of Radiology (ACR) Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) for early detection of lung cancer.


METHODS
We examined a set of 72 PNs (31 benign and 41 malignant) from the Lung Image Database Consortium image collection (LIDC-IDRI). One hundred three CT radiomic features were extracted from each PN. Before the model building process, distinctive features were identified using a hierarchical clustering method. We then constructed a prediction model by using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier coupled with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). A tenfold cross-validation (CV) was repeated ten times (10 Ã— 10-fold CV) to evaluate the accuracy of the SVM-LASSO model. Finally, the best model from the 10 Ã— 10-fold CV was further evaluated using 20 Ã— 5- and 50 Ã— 2-fold CVs.


RESULTS
The best SVM-LASSO model consisted of only two features: the bounding box anterior-posterior dimension (BB_AP) and the standard deviation of inverse difference moment (SD_IDM). The BB_AP measured the extension of a PN in the anterior-posterior direction and was highly correlated (r = 0.94) with the PN size. The SD_IDM was a texture feature that measured the directional variation of the local homogeneity feature IDM. Univariate analysis showed that both features were statistically significant and discriminative (P = 0.00013 and 0.000038, respectively). PNs with larger BB_AP or smaller SD_IDM were more likely malignant. The 10 Ã— 10-fold CV of the best SVM model using the two features achieved an accuracy of 84.6% and 0.89 AUC. By comparison, Lung-RADS achieved an accuracy of 72.2% and 0.77 AUC using four features (size, type, calcification, and spiculation). The prediction improvement of SVM-LASSO comparing to Lung-RADS was statistically significant (McNemar's test P = 0.026). Lung-RADS misclassified 19 cases because it was mainly based on PN size, whereas the SVM-LASSO model correctly classified 10 of these cases by combining a size (BB_AP) feature and a texture (SD_IDM) feature. The performance of the SVM-LASSO model was stable when leaving more patients out with five- and twofold CVs (accuracy 84.1% and 81.6%, respectively).


CONCLUSION
We developed an SVM-LASSO model to predict malignancy of PNs with two CT radiomic features. We demonstrated that the model achieved an accuracy of 84.6%, which was 12.4% higher than Lung-RADS.",2018,Medical Physics
Concomitant assessment of anionic sites of the glomerular basement membrane and the visceral epithelium,"The glomerular capillary wall contains fixed negativecharged sites at different levels, which can be identified under the electron microscope (Farquhar & Kanwar, 1983; Kanwar, 1984). The identification of the polyanionic surface coat (glycocalyx) of podocytes with probe molecules is particularly important because of the critical role it may play, together with intracellular actin filaments, in keeping the normal shape and the interdigitations of foot processes (Seiler et al., 1975; Kanwar, 1984). The negative charge of the glomerular basement membrane, which is largely due to heparan sulphate proteoglycans (Kanwar & Farquhar, 1976), can also be demonstrated with a variety of cationic probes such as Alcian Blue, Ruthenium Red, lysozyme and colloidal iron. The use of the these probes is hampered, however, by poor penetration of the reagents and potential diffusion of reagents from reaction sites. Previous observations (Simionescu et al., 1981) have shown that brief fixation of tissues with aldehydes and subsequent blocking of free aldehyde groups did not alter the number and distribution of anionic sites. This finding allowed us to develop a technique that combines labelling of the anionic sites of the glomerular basement membrane in vivo and of the polyanionic coat of the glomerular epithelial cell in vitro. Herein we report this technique and compare the results obtained in glomeruli of normal and nephrotic rats. 9 Five normal adult female Lewis rats and ten rats immunized with renal tubular brush border antigen (Fxl) (Glassock et al., 1968) were used. Cationized ferritin, isoelectric point 7.7-8.5, was prepared according to Danon et al. (1972). Details of tracer preparation and pI estimates are given elsewhere (Kelley & Cavallo, 1980). The ferritin preparation was infused (0.4mgg -1 body wt) systemically at a constant flow rate of 0.1 ml min -I. Both kidneys were sampled 5 min after delivery of the ferritin. The following protocol gave consistently reproducible results.",2005,The Histochemical Journal
Variational Inference of Penalized Regression with Submodular Functions,"Various regularizers inducing structuredsparsity are constructed as LovÃ¡sz extensions of submodular functions. In this paper, we consider a hierarchical probabilistic model of linear regression and its kernel extension with this type of regularization, and develop a variational inference scheme for the posterior estimate on this model. We derive an upper bound on the partition function with an approximation guarantee, and then show that minimizing this bound is equivalent to the minimization of a quadratic function over the polyhedron determined by the corresponding submodular function, which can be solved efficiently by the proximal gradient algorithm. Our scheme gives a natural extension of the Bayesian Lasso model for the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to a variety of regularizers inducing structured sparsity, and thus this work provides a principled way to transfer the advantages of the Bayesian formulation into those models. Finally, we investigate the empirical performance of our scheme with several Bayesian variants of widely known models such as Lasso, generalized fused Lasso, and non-overlapping group Lasso.",2019,
"Development of a non-toxic, ecologically compatible, natural-resource based insecticide from diatomaceous earth deposits of South Eastern Europe to control stored-grain insect pests","Diatomaceous earth (DE) deposits from regions of Southeastern Europe were evaluated as regards their insecticidal effect against several insect pests that infest stored products such as S. oryzae (L.), Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), Tribolium confusum (DuVal), T. castaneum (Herbst), Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Steph.). Fifteen DE deposits were obtained from different geographical locations of Greece (Kriti, Elassona, Begora), Serbia (Kolubara, Vamje), Former Yugoslavic Republilc of Macedonia (F.Y.R.O.M.), Slovenia and Germany. Also, the commercially available DE formulation Silicosec was used as positive control. Initially the effect of temperature and r.h. on the efficacy of the local DEs was evaluated. The local DEs were applied on hard wheat at 900 ppm at three temperatures (20 Â°c, 25 Â°c and 30 Â°C) and two levels of relative humidity (55 Â± 5% and 65 Â± 5%). Mortality of adults of S. oryzae, R. dominica and T. confusum was evaluated after 7d of exposure of the individuals on the treated commodity. Next, the effect of grain type on the insecticidal action of them local DEs against adults of the above species was evaluated. In this series of experiments, the local DEs were applied at two dose rates (500 and 1000 ppm) at four different grain commodities ; bar1ey, hard wheat, maize and paddy rice. Mortality of the above species was assessed after 7d of exposure at 25 Â°c / 60 Â± 5% r.h. Subsequently, fractions of the local DEs were obtained by dry sieving through different mesh sieves.

How to lasso a plane gravitational wave,"Beginning with the stress-energy tensor of an elastic string this paper derives a relativistic string and its form in a parallel transported Fermi frame including its reduction to a Cosserat string in the Newtonian limit. In a Fermi frame gravitational curvature is seen to induce three dominant relative acceler- ation terms dependent on: position, velocity and position, strain and position, respectively. An example of a string arranged in an axially flowing ring (a lasso) is shown to have a set of natural frequencies that can be parametrically excited by a monochromatic plane gravitational wave. The lasso also exhibits, in common with spinning particles, oscillations about geodesic motion in proportion to spin magnitude and wave amplitude when the spin axis lies in the gravitational wave front.",2005,

Predicting the Presence of Purpose Through the Self-Efficacy Beliefs of Oneâ€™s Talents,"AbstractIndividuals with greater levels of purpose and meaning tend to be happier, demonstrate greater selfcontrol, strong values, and have healthier mental attitudes (Molasso, 2006a; Steger, 2009). It has been suggested that knowing oneâ€™s talents may be related to the development of purpose, but this hypothesis has not been previously tested. This study examines the self-efficacy belief in oneâ€™s talents identified through the Clifton StrengthsFinderÂ® and its relationship to hope, well-being, and meaning in life among college students. Results from a path analysis indicate that these self-efficacy beliefs can predict hope and the presence of meaning in life, and the results may suggest that this inventory can be a practical assessment tool.",2014,Journal of College and Character
Machine Learning Methods for Estimating Heterogeneous Causal Effectsâˆ—,"In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unitâ€™s attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unitâ€™s outcome. The challenge is that the â€œground truthâ€ for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine.",2015,
Prediction of Early Season Nitrogen Uptake in Maize Using High-Resolution Aerial Hyperspectral Imagery,"The ability to predict spatially explicit nitrogen uptake (NUP) in maize (Zea mays L) during the early development stages provides clear value for making in-season nitrogen fertilizer applications that can improve NUP efficiency and reduce the risk of nitrogen loss to the environment. Aerial hyperspectral imaging is an attractive agronomic research tool for its ability to capture spectral data over relatively large areas, enabling its use for predicting NUP at the field scale. The overarching goal of this work was to use supervised learning regression algorithmsâ€”Lasso, support vector regression (SVR), random forest, and partial least squares regression (PLSR)â€”to predict early season (i.e., V6â€“V14) maize NUP at three experimental sites in Minnesota using high-resolution hyperspectral imagery. In addition to the spectral features offered by hyperspectral imaging, the 10th percentile Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index Improved (MCARI2) was made available to the learning models as an auxiliary feature to assess its ability to improve NUP prediction accuracy. The trained models demonstrated robustness by maintaining satisfactory prediction accuracy across locations, pixel sizes, development stages, and a broad range of NUP values (4.8 to 182 kg ha-1). Using the four most informative spectral features in addition to the auxiliary feature, the mean absolute error (MAE) of Lasso, SVR, and PLSR models (9.4, 9.7, and 9.5 kg ha-1, respectively) was lower than that of random forest (11.2 kg ha-1). The relative MAE for the Lasso, SVR, PLSR, and random forest models was 16.5%, 17.0%, 16.6%, and 19.6%, respectively. The inclusion of the auxiliary feature not only improved overall prediction accuracy by 1.6 kg ha-1 (14%) across all models, but it also reduced the number of input features required to reach optimal performance. The variance of predicted NUP increased as the measured NUP increased (MAE of the Lasso model increased from 4.0 to 12.1 kg ha-1 for measured NUP less than 25 kg ha-1 and greater than 100 kg ha-1, respectively). The most influential spectral features were oftentimes adjacent to each other (i.e., within approximately 6 nm), indicating the importance of both spectral precision and derivative spectra around key wavelengths for explaining NUP. Finally, several challenges and opportunities are discussed regarding the use of these results in the context of improving nitrogen fertilizer management.",2020,Remote Sensing
Institute of Statistics Mimeo Series No . 2576 Nonparametric Model Selection in Hazard Regression,"We propose a novel model selection method for a nonparametric extension of the Cox proportional hazard model, in the framework of smoothing splines ANOVA models. The method automates the model building and model selection process simultaneously by imposing a penalty on the norms instead of squared norms. It is a natural extension of the LASSO to the situation where component selection is of interest. We further propose an efficient algorithm based on a reformulation of the penalized likelihood. Adaptive choice of the smoothing parameter is discussed. Both simulations and real examples suggest that our proposal is very powerful for model selection and component estimation in survival analysis. MSC : 62N02, 62G08.",2005,
On the application of statistical learning approaches to construct inverse probability weights in marginal structural Cox models: Hedging against weight-model misspecification,"ABSTRACT The marginal structural Cox model (MSCM) estimates can be highly sensitive to weight-model misspecification. We assess the performance of various popular statistical learners, such as LASSO, support vector machines, CART, bagged CART, and boosted CART, in estimating MSCM weights. When weight-models are misspecified, we find that the weights computed from boosted CART generally lead to less MSE and better coverage for the MSCM estimates. This study is motivated by the investigation of the impact of beta-interferon treatment on disability progression in subjects with multiple sclerosis from British Columbia, Canada (1995â€“2008).",2017,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
Non-Theological Supplement,"Before moving on to our construction of a unified theory of philosophical theology and ecology we must deal more directly with Meillassouxâ€™s strong criticism of non-philosophy Remember that this criticism was directed at the threat of dogmatism in non-philosophy, specifically with regard to its claim to think from the Real. But the reason we have to deal with this strong criticism is not due to philosophical rules or on philosophical grounds. Rather this general axiomatic structure of non-philosophy, where the Real-One is foreclosed to thought and yet thought has relative autonomy before it as thought from the Real-One, is formally similar to theology. This is especially true of those theologies, like environmental theology, that aim to understand the relationship science and philosophy have toward reality. If this is true, and I show its validity later, then there is a question of why I am engaging in the non-philosophical project rather than simply a theological one. To answer that question I must first address Laruelleâ€™s own work on religion, which has been the dominant material of Philosophy IV and the source of a number of central concepts such as heresy. But additionally I must also provide a theory of theology that locates its own particular self-sufficient character.",2013,
Transport in Hamiltonian systems with slowly changing phase spacestructure,"Transport in Hamiltonian systems with weak chaotic perturbations hasbeen much studied in the past. In this paper, we introduce a new classof problems: transport in Hamiltonian systems with slowly changingphase space structure that are not order one perturbations of a givenHamiltonian. This class of problems is very important for many applications,for instance in celestial mechanics. As an example, we study a classof one-dimensional Hamiltonians that depend explicitly on time andon stochastic external parameters. The variations of the externalparameters are responsible for a distortion of the phase space structures:chaotic, weakly chaotic and regular sets change with time. We showthat theoretical predictions of transport rates can be made in thelimit where the variations of the stochastic parameters are very slowcompared to the Hamiltonian dynamics. Exact asymptotic results canbe obtained in the classical case where the Hamiltonian dynamics isintegrable for fixed values of the parameters. For the more interestingchaotic Hamiltonian dynamics case, we show that two mechanisms contributeto the transport. For some range of the parameter variations, onemechanism -called transport by migration together withthe mixing regions - is dominant. We are then able tomodel transport in phase space by a Markov model, the local diffusionmodel, and to give reasonably good transport estimates.",2019,arXiv: Chaotic Dynamics
Fragility analysis of continuous pipelines subjected to transverse permanent ground deformation,"Abstract The structural integrity of buried continuous pipelines can be jeopardized by transverse permanent ground deformation (PGD) induced by landslides. A probabilistic analysis can facilitate understanding the likelihood of damage to pipelines in landslide regions, further minimizing the risk. However, empirical fragility curves for the landslide-pipeline interaction problem are not available due to the lack of field data. The problem can be addressed by numerical approaches. In this study, a simplified two-dimensional numerical model is developed. It characterizes the pipes as beam-type structures and the surrounding soil as Winkler springs. It is compared here against three-dimensional continuum-based analyses, which could save extensively on computational efforts. All input parameters were sampled randomly and paired with the displacement demands to form a limited set of statistically significant, yet nominally identical, pipeline samples, and the demand models for the maximum tensile strain were evaluated. A supervised machine learning technique, called Lasso regression, was then used to establish a predictive relation between the input and the output using the limited dataset, based on which a large dataset (one million) was calculated for the fragility analysis. The use of a Winkler-based analysis and the supervised machine learning technique makes it possible to generate fragility curves for pipelines subjected to transverse PGD for the first time.",2018,Soils and Foundations

Endoscopic approach of the proximal jejunum or, by a retrograde way, of the distal ileum can be achieved with adult or pediatric standard colonoscopes or with better results via a video-colonoscope. Over the ileo-caecal valve, endoscopy is contributive to the diagnosis of Crohnâ€™s disease, tuberculosis and small bowel lymphoma;â€¢ in case of unexplained gastro-intestinal hemorrhage, small bowel enteroscopy allows an exploration of a large area of intestinal surface. When an hemorrhage is life-threatening, per-operative enteroscopy is recommended. In case of chronic unexplained blood loss, complete enteroscopy can be performed using fiber- or video ã€Š sonde enteroscopes ã€‹; most of them are prototypes.
 This procedure is safe, time-consuming but may be performed in out-patients. Some limitations must be outlined: inability to explore completely the intestinal surface, need of an experienced team with an up-to-date training. Therefore this investigation is at the third rank, when the previous current examinations are negative.Push enteroscopy may be programmed by a general endoscopist. Conversely, non-surgical enteroscopy and per-operative enteroscopy require skilled teams interested in such problems.ResumenLa endoscopia del intestino delgado en 1992 debe ser enfocado en dos situaciones clÃ­nicas diferentes: ante un sindrome de malabsÃ³ciÃ³n serÃ¡ realizada una enteroscopia limitada por medio de un video-colonoscopio adulto o de endoscopios pediÃ¡tricos clÃ¡sicos empujados por delante del Ã¡ngulo de Treitz. El Ã­leon serÃ¡ explorado en el curso de una colonoscopia total y permitirÃ¡ el diagnÃ³stico de las colitis inflamatorias infecciosas y de los linfomas. Ante una hemorragia digestiva no explicada si la vida del paciente no estÃ¡ en juego y ante la negatividad de otras investigaciones, una enteroscopia total estÃ¡ indicada por medio de una sonda video. Este examen estÃ¡ aÃºn reservado para equipos entrenados. Por el contrario, si la hemorragia pone en juego el pronÃ³stico vital, una enteroscopia quirÃºrgica podra ser realizada fÃ¡cilmente por enterotomÃ­a per-operatoria; las exploraciones endoscÃ³picas clÃ¡sicas y la arteriografÃ­a no hubieran permitido la demostraciÃ³n de lesiones patolÃ³gicas.Actualmente es por tanto posible hacer endoscopia del intestino delgado con la ayuda de los endoscopios clÃ¡sicos y aÃºn mejor con los video-endoscopios que permiten un anÃ¡lisis fino de la mucosa y un tratamiento informÃ¡tico de la imagen recibida. Esta enteroscopia limitada esta a la pÃºerta de todo endoscopista entrenado. Por el contrario, la enteroscopia total no quirÃºrgica estÃ¡ en pleno desarrollo, los aparatos estan en estado de prototipo, es todavÃ­a un examen de tercer nivel. En efecto, el ileon es alcanzado en 6 horas, 50 % de la mucosa es examinada. Sinembargo puede ya ser realizada en forma ambulatoria.ZusammenfassungDie Endoskopie des DÃ¼nndarms 1991 muÃŸ von 2 Seiten hergesehen werden: Im Falle eines Malabsorptionssyndromes wird eine partielle Endoskopie mit Hilfe des Videoendoskopes vorgenommen oder mit dem klassischen PÃ¤diatoskop, die jeweils bis zum Treitzâ€™schen Band vorgeschoben werden kÃ¶nnen. Das Ileum kann im Rahmen einer totalen Coloskopie eingesehen werden und erlaubt die Diagnostik von entzÃ¼dlichen, infektiÃ¶sen Darmerkrankungen und von Lymphomen.Bei unklarem intestinalen Blutverlust ohne Entstehen einer Notfallsituation ist eine totale Enteroskopie bei negativem Ausfall anderer Untersuchungen angezeigt. Diese Untersuchungsmethode bleibt jedoch noch speziellen Zentren vorbehalten. Bei Vorliegen einer interstinalen massiven und lebensbedrohlichen Blutung ist eine chirurgische Enteroskopie die Diagnoseform der Wahl mittels eines operativ angelegtem Enterostomas. Diese Technik sollte vor allem dann durchgefÃ¼hrt werden, wenn die herkÃ¶mmlichen endoskopischen Untersuchungen und die ArtÃ©riographie keinen Hinweis auf eine Blutungsquelle erbracht haben.Dennoch ist eine teilweise Endoskopie des DÃ¼nndarmes im Sinne einer partiellen Enteroskopie mit den herkÃ¶mmlichen Fiberskopen sowie mit Videoendoskopen mÃ¶glich, wobei letztere eine lupenmikroskopische Betrachtung der Schleimhaut ermÃ¶glichen. Diese partielle Enteroskopie steht jedem erfahrenen Endoskopiker zur VerfÃ¼gung.Weit vorangeschritten ist die Entwicklung der totalen nicht-chirurgischen Enteroskopie. Entsprechende Endoskope sind als Prototypen erhÃ¤ltlich. Mit Hilfe dieser Instrumente wird das Ileum nach 6 Stunden erreicht, wobei 50 % der Schleimhaut beurteilt werden kÃ¶nnen. Die totale Enteroskopie kann bereits ambulant vorgenommen werden.RiassuntoLâ€™esecuzione di una enteroscopia deve essere presa in considerazione nellâ€™ambito di diverse situazioni cliniche: nel caso ci si trovi di fronte ad una sospetta sindrome da malassorbimento si potrÃ  effettuare, con lâ€™aiuto di un videoendoscopio di tipo normale o di endoscopi di tipo pediatrico, una enteroscopia limitata al tratto intestinale localizzato subito a valle della flessura del Treitz. Lâ€™ileo, nel caso di sospetto di malattia infiammatoria cronica o di linfoma, potrÃ  essere esplorato nella sua porzione terminale nel corso di una colonscopia totale. In presenza di una emorragia digestiva di origine sconosciuta in un paziente non critico, vista la negativitÃ  di tutti gli altri esami, puÃ¶ essere presa in considerazione lâ€™esecuzione di un esame endoscopico totale dellâ€™intestino tenue mediante enteroscopio. Questa procedura diagnostica Ã¨ ancora allo stato sperimentale e deve essere eseguita solo in centri selezionati. Nel caso ci si trovi, invece, di fronte ad una emorragia importante in paziente in gravi condizioni, eseguiti con esito negativo gli esami endoscopici e arteriografici, Ã¨ consigliabile procedere ad una enteroscopia perioperatoria dopo enterotomia chirurgica. Eâ€™ dunque attualmente possibile osservare endoscopicamente la maggior parte dellâ€™intestino tenue con lâ€™aiuto di endoscopi a fibre ottiche o meglio con videoendoscopi che permettono una visione piÃ¹ dettagliata della superfice mucosa ed un trattamento informatico delle immagini raccolte. Questa metodica Ã¨ facilmente eseguibile da tutti gli endoscopisti dopo un periodo di training. Per contro, lâ€™enteroscopia totale non chirurgica Ã¨ una metodica in pieno sviluppo, gli apparecchi ancora allo stadio di prototipi e deve essere considerata unâ€™esame di terzo livello. Il tempo medio per raggiungere lâ€™ileo Ã¨ di 6 ore e durante lâ€™esame circa il 50 % della mucosa tenuale viene osservata; ciÃ  permette di eseguire questo esame anche in regime ambulatoriale.",2008,Acta Endoscopica
Comparing Ridge and LASSO estimators for data analysis,Abstract This paper is devoted to the comparison of Ridge and LASSO estimators.

Social Media Aided Stock Market Predictions by Sparsity Induced Regression,"Prediction of the stock market has been a research topic for decades. Recently, data from social media like Google and Twitter are included in prediction models. This data serves as an indicator of sentiments that are potentially useful for prediction. Interpretation of current prediction methods is cumbersome. Beforehand it is not known which data is relevant for the prediction and hence which data should be added to the model. To improve interpretability and thereby credibility of the results, this thesis uses sparse regression methods that automatically discard data that is not useful for the prediction. Current methods induce sparsity via L1-regularization such as the LASSO. In contrast to traditional applications, this thesis assumes that a sparse, time-varying regression vector is estimated from time series data that arrives sequentially over time. Data can thus not be treated in batch form where constant behavior over a window is assumed and hence performance of current sparse regression methods is limited. Therefore, a new Weighted Sparse Kalman Filter (Weighted-SKF) is proposed that induces sparsity in the KF equations. The KF is able to track time-varying behavior, while the sparsity ensures that interpretable results are obtained. Simulations demonstrate that the Weighted-SKF outperforms current regression methods in identifying the time-varying support and regression vector. Moreover, the time-varying usefulness of social media data is demonstrated: the Weighted-SKF includes social media data in its prediction model only during large declines in the stock market.",2014,
A GICA-TVGL framework to study sex differences in resting state fMRI dynamic connectivity,"BACKGROUND
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been implemented widely to study brain connectivity. In particular, time-varying connectivity analysis has emerged as an important measure to uncover essential knowledge within the network. On the other hand, independent component analysis (ICA) has served as a powerful tool to preprocess fMRI data before performing network analysis. Together, they may lead to novel findings.


METHODS
We propose a new framework (GICA-TVGL) that combines group ICA (GICA) with time-varying graphical LASSO (TVGL) to improve the power of analyzing functional connectivity (FNC) changes, which is then applied for neuro-developmental study. To investigate the performance of our proposed approach, we apply it to capture dynamic FNC using both the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) and the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) datasets.


RESULTS
Our results indicate that females and males in young adult group possess substantial difference related to visual network. In addition, some other consistent conclusions have been reached by using these two datasets. Furthermore, the GICA-TVGL model indicated that females had a higher probability to stay in a stable state. Males had a higher tendency to remain in a globally disconnected mode. Comparison with existing method: The performance of sliding window approach is largely affected by the window size selection. In addition, it also assumes temporal locality hypothesis.


CONCLUSION
Our proposed framework provides a feasible method to investigate brain dynamics and has the potential to become a widely used tool in neuroimaging studies.",2020,Journal of Neuroscience Methods
Sparse linear modeling of next-generation mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data for isoform discovery and abundance estimation.,"Since the inception of next-generation mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology, various attempts have been made to utilize RNA-Seq data in assembling full-length mRNA isoforms de novo and estimating abundance of isoforms. However, for genes with more than a few exons, the problem tends to be challenging and often involves identifiability issues in statistical modeling. We have developed a statistical method called ""sparse linear modeling of RNA-Seq data for isoform discovery and abundance estimation"" (SLIDE) that takes exon boundaries and RNA-Seq data as input to discern the set of mRNA isoforms that are most likely to present in an RNA-Seq sample. SLIDE is based on a linear model with a design matrix that models the sampling probability of RNA-Seq reads from different mRNA isoforms. To tackle the model unidentifiability issue, SLIDE uses a modified Lasso procedure for parameter estimation. Compared with deterministic isoform assembly algorithms (e.g., Cufflinks), SLIDE considers the stochastic aspects of RNA-Seq reads in exons from different isoforms and thus has increased power in detecting more novel isoforms. Another advantage of SLIDE is its flexibility of incorporating other transcriptomic data such as RACE, CAGE, and EST into its model to further increase isoform discovery accuracy. SLIDE can also work downstream of other RNA-Seq assembly algorithms to integrate newly discovered genes and exons. Besides isoform discovery, SLIDE sequentially uses the same linear model to estimate the abundance of discovered isoforms. Simulation and real data studies show that SLIDE performs as well as or better than major competitors in both isoform discovery and abundance estimation. The SLIDE software package is available at https://sites.google.com/site/jingyijli/SLIDE.zip.",2011,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
"Population dynamics and postâ€settlement mortality of the ornate wrasse, Thalassoma pavo, in the Tyrrhenian Sea (western Mediterranean)","Abstract Population dynamics and postâ€settlement mortality of the ornate wrasse, Thalassoma pavo, were studied by visual censuses from July 1997 to December 1998 at the Island of Ischia (Gulf of Naples, western Mediterranean). The size classes best represented throughout the year encompassed specimens from 9 to 17 cm in length, chiefly females and, to a lesser extent, terminal phase males. Fish longer than 18 cm (mainly terminal phase males) were rare during the winterâ€spring period, while they slightly increased in abundance from Julyâ€August to November. Newly settled T. pavo juveniles, which display distinct livery patterns from adults, arrived in late Augustâ€early September, reaching settlement abundance peaks in midâ€September, both in 1997 and 1998. During the first year of study, juveniles survived the winter period and were recruited into the adult population, whereas the following year they completely disappeared during November. Due to the wellâ€known thermophily of the studied species, the significantly higher postâ€settlement mortality rate estimated for 1998, in comparison with the 1997 value, was attributed to the unusual decrease of surface water temperature occurring in November 1998. The results reported here suggest that densityâ€independent mechanisms such as fluctuating abiotic conditions could be more important in affecting the population dynamics of T. pavo than densityâ€dependent biotic interactions.",2001,Italian Journal of Zoology
The Single-Molecule Mechanics of the Latent TGF-Î²1 Complex,"BACKGROUND
TGF-Î²1 controls many pathophysiological processes including tissue homeostasis, fibrosis, and cancer progression. Together with its latency-associated peptide (LAP), TGF-Î²1 binds to the latent TGF-Î²1-binding protein-1 (LTBP-1), which is part of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Transmission of cell force via integrins is one major mechanism to activate latent TGF-Î²1 from ECM stores. Latent TGF-Î²1 mechanical activation is more efficient with higher cell forces and ECM stiffening. However, little is known about the molecular events involved in this mechanical activation mechanism.


RESULTS
By using single-molecule force spectroscopy and magnetic microbeads, we analyzed how forces exerted on the LAP lead to conformational changes in the latent complex that can ultimately result in TGF-Î²1 release. We demonstrate the unfolding of two LAP key domains for mechanical TGF-Î²1 activation: the Î±1 helix and the latency lasso, which together have been referred to as the ""straitjacket"" that keeps TGF-Î²1 associated with LAP. The simultaneous unfolding of both domains, leading to full opening of the straitjacket at a force of ~40 pN, was achieved only when TGF-Î²1 was bound to the LTBP-1 in the ECM.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results directly demonstrate opening of the TGF-Î²1 straitjacket by application of mechanical force in the order of magnitude of what can be transmitted by single integrins. For this mechanism to be in place, binding of latent TGF-Î²1 to LTBP-1 is mandatory. Interfering with mechanical activation of latent TGF-Î²1 by reducing integrin affinity, cell contractility, and binding of latent TGF-Î²1 to the ECM provides new possibilities to therapeutically modulate TGF-Î²1 actions.",2011,Current Biology
"Semantic Webbing, Semantic-Pictorial Webbing and Standard Basal Teaching Techniques: A Comparison of Three Strategies To Enhance Learning and Memory of a Reading Comprehension Task in the Fourth Grade Classroom.","A study analyzed the relative effectiveness of three teaching strategies for enhancing vocabulary and reading comprehension. Sixty-eight students in three fourth-grade classrooms in a suburban southwestern public school were presented with a vocabulary lesson on weather from the reading text according to one of the following strategies: (1) basal discussion technique (schema theory); (2) discussion through hierarchical presentation of key terms and semantic webbing (hierarchical presentation theory); or (3) discussion through hierarchical presentation of key terms and pictorial webbing (dual coding theory). Following the vocabulary lasson, students read the target passage from their texts silently. After the reading was completed, students were given the multiple choice measura of comprehension from the teacher's edition of the textbook. The same measure was administered one week later. Results indicated that students in the classroom instructed with semantic webbing performed significantly better, especially on the delayed recall measure. Memory between low and high achieving students varied differentially according to instructional strategy. Combining pictorial and written stimuli appeared to interfere with retention, especially among low achievers. (Nine tables of data are included; 19 references are attached.)

The early Cretaceous marine transgression and its significance for landscape interpretation,"SUMMARY Significant elements of the Australian landscape date from Mesozoic or earlier times. Australia did not separate completely from other Gondwanan components until Early Tertiary times and these Mesozoic and older elements can therefore be regarded as Gondwanan. During the separation and northern drift of the continent and particularly in Late Jurassic and earlier Cretaceous times the sea invaded and spread across much of the erstwhile landmass. The associated sediments not only covered and preserved much of the preâ€existing land surface, but they also augmented the effects of thalassostatic loading of the basins, causing further subsidence. Hinge lines developed near the coastal zones of the times, so that subsidence of the basins caused adjacent land masses to rise. Many old land surfaces have been reâ€exposed at the former oceanic margins, but epigene forms are preserved high in the relief on the uplifted blocks. They survive partly because, as Crickmay (1976) suggested, rivers effectively erode a...",1991,Australian Geographer
The Relative Efficiency of Jordanian Public Hospitals Using Data Envelopment Analysis and Pabon Lasso Diagram,"This study aims at investigating and measuring the relative efficiency of public hospitals performance in Jordan, during the period (2006-2008), using DEA and Pabon-Lasso Diagram. The results indicate that the average efficiency of those hospitals is varied and ranges between (73%) to (100%). The average of the relative efficiency of the sample hospitals over the study period is 94%. Of 15 hospitals, the number of efficient hospitals increased from 7 in 2006 to 9 in 2007, but decreased to 8 in 2008. The results are compared with old efficiency scores of the same hospitals reported in the literature. This comparison leads to signify that the efficiency of public sector hospitals in Jordan is varied over time, due to decreasing public expenditures on health care per capita. However, the results concerning ratio analysis in explaining efficiency are inconsistent; implying that these institutions are either having poor management or they treat long stays diseases.",2013,The Global Journal of Business Research

Risk Factors of Manufacturing Industries,"In the work a comparison of risk factors influencing the probability of a negative value of companies (stage of prebankruptcy), for various manufacturing industries: the range of financial variables and corporate governance factors. The idea of corporate financial architecture were confirmed in the Russian industry: factors affecting the corporate structure of the company (characteristics of the CEO and ownership concentration) can be effectively applied for the analysis of financial stability of companies along with traditional financial indicators, improving the predictive quality of the models. Good stability of the obtained results was confirmed by serial build and comparison of logistic regression with lasso regularization and logistic regression models for all subsets. Next, were confirmed the statistical significance of 88,1% of the explaining factors of all final specifications. During the study period 2011Ã¢Â€Â“2015 dynamics of the intensity of bankruptcies in the manufacturing sector were not always uniform. In the analyzed period were identified both specific and general risk factors for considered sectors. The forecast quality of the final specifications for the industries demonstrated its high level in the control samples, the value of AUC (area under ROC-curve) is in the range from 85,06% in metallurgical production to 96,12% in mechanical engineering. Empirical results show that the sectoral differentiation of risk factors in the Russian manufacturing industry can be taken into consideration by enterprises, credit institutions and regulatory authorities in the conduct of crisis management and branch transformation of the existing methodological recommendations for developing financial and investment policy of the company.",2018,
Efficient Sparse Banded Acoustic Models for Speech Recognition,"We propose sparse banded acoustic models to significantly improve the recognition accuracy and reduce the computational cost of speech recognition systems. The sparse banded models are trained using a weighted lasso regularization. In addition, we propose new feature orders to reduce the bandwidth of sparse banded models in order to speed up computation. Experimental results on the Wall Street Journal data set show that sparse banded models significantly outperform diagonal and full covariance models by 9.5% and 15.1% relatively. Sparse banded models also run the fastest. The advantages of sparse banded models are also demonstrated on the collected Cantonese data set.",2014,IEEE Signal Processing Letters
"Redescription of Thalassodes antithetica Herbulot, 1962, an endemic moth from Inner Seychelles (Lepidoptera: Geometridae: Geometrinae).","The Seychelles archipelago is characterized by an exceptionally high level of endemism in certain taxa, including at least 275 endemic species of Lepidoptera (Legrand 1966; Gerlach & Matyot 2006; De Prins & De Prins 2015). Despite the fact that endemics are the main objects of conservation efforts, information regarding endemic Seychelles Lepidoptera is very poor, because the majority of them are known from a single or a few specimens (Legrand 1966; Gerlach and Matyot 2006; Bolotov et al. 2014, 2015). The emerald moth specimens are lacking in extensive samples obtained by earlier collectors (Fletcher 1910; Scott 1910; Fryer 1912). Further, two emerald moth species in the genus Thalassodes GuenÃ©e, 1858 have been reported from Seychelles, i.e., the widespread T. quadraria GuenÃ©e, 1858 (Legrand 1966; Gerlach & Matyot 2006; De Prins & De Prins 2015) and the endemic T. antithetica Herbulot, 1962. The latter species is known from eight specimens, collected between 1959 and 1963 (Legrand 1966; Gerlach & Matyot 2006). Herbulot (1962) provided a very short description of this species without any illustration. The protologue consists of a description of some external characters, i.e., antennae, palpi and legs, as well as the pattern of markings, but the male and female genitalia are not described. As the main diagnostic features, Herbulot (1962) noted two specific characters in the male morphology, namely the hind tibia with a single pair of spurs and an exceptional development of the lateral processes (octavals) on the posterior margin of the eighth sternite.",2016,Zootaxa
Additive models and many smooth univariate functions,"Additive models build a nonparametric extension of linear models and as such, they exhibit a substantial degree of flexibility. While the most important effects may still be detected by a linear model, substantial improvements are potentially possible by using the more flexible additive model class. At first sight, it seems very ambitious to fit additive models with high-dimensional covariates but sparsity implies feasible computations and good statistical properties. Besides encouraging sparsity, it is important to control smoothness as well. This can be achieved by a sparsity-smoothness penalty function. The combination of sparsity and smoothness is crucial for mathematical theory as well as for better performance on data. We discuss in this chapter methodology and computational aspects which are related to the group Lasso presented in Chapter 4.",2011,
Proteomics analysis to reveal biological pathways and predictive proteins in the survival of high-grade serous ovarian cancer,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is an aggressive cancer with a worse clinical outcome. Therefore, studies about the prognosis of HGSC may provide therapeutic avenues to improve patient outcomes. Since genome alteration are manifested at the protein level, we integrated protein and mRNA data of ovarian cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and utilized the sparse overlapping group lasso (SOGL) method, a new mechanism-driven variable selection method, to select dysregulated pathways and crucial proteins related to the survival of HGSC. We found that biosynthesis of amino acids was the main biological pathway with the best predictive performance (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.900). A panel of three proteins, namely EIF2B1, PRPS1L1 and MAPK13 were selected as potential predictive proteins and the risk score consisting of these three proteins has predictive performance for overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS), with AUC of 0.976 and 0.932, respectively. Our study provides additional information for further mechanism and therapeutic avenues to improve patient outcomes in clinical practice.",2017,Scientific Reports

Reconstructing Regional Trajectories: the Provenance and Distribution of Archaic to Hellenistic Ceramics in Central Pisidia (Southâ€west Turkey),"Analytical ceramic studies offer the opportunity to determine cultural development and change on the basis of origin and use of raw materials. In this particular study, an archaeometric approach on ceramics in central Pisidia contributes to the discussion of contact and exchange between indigenous communities and several cultural spheres of influence on a long-term timescale (eighth to second centuries bce). Morphological data as well as mineralogical (optical microscopy; n = 273) and chemical composition (by ICP-OES/MS; n = 122) of ceramics and raw materials show distinct resource zones for the production and distribution of ceramics in this connecting region of Anatolia. The use of trace element profiles (REE, HFSE, LILE and TTE) in particular is regarded as instrumental in detailing high-resolution provenancing of ceramics. The ceramic provenance indicates different patterns of material interactions during the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods. A significant increase in regional interaction occurs coinciding with the development of pottery activities at Sagalassos.",2017,Archaeometry

What Drives Green Fodder Supply in China?â€”A Nerlovian Analysis with LASSO Variable Selection,"To understand key factors that drive Chinaâ€™s green fodder supply, this study estimates a Nerlovian partial-adjustment model, using provincial-level panel data spanning two decades (1997â€“2016). Based on a set of explanatory variables selected by the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) method, estimation of the Nerlovian model by the system-GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) method yields three key findings. First, while farmersâ€™ previous cultivation decisions on green fodder supply strongly predict their current decisions, without the influence of other drivers, Chinaâ€™s green fodder supply tends to decline over time. Second, among the identified drivers, government policy plays the most significant roleâ€”the availability of subsidies for cultivation of green fodder crops raises the sown area of green fodder crops by more than 30 percent. In contrast, farmerâ€™s sown-area decision is only modestly responsive to price incentives. Finally, while the stock of fixed capital inputs (e.g., number of combine harvesters) and natural disasters (e.g., floods) both affect green fodder supply, their impacts are small.",2019,Sustainability
Sparse matrix inversion with scaled Lasso,"We propose a new method of learning a sparse nonnegative-definite target matrix. Our primary example of the target matrix is the inverse of a population covariance or correlation matrix. The algorithm first estimates each column of the target matrix by the scaled Lasso and then adjusts the matrix estimator to be symmetric. The penalty level of the scaled Lasso for each column is completely determined by data via convex minimization, without using cross-validation. 
We prove that this scaled Lasso method guarantees the fastest proven rate of convergence in the spectrum norm under conditions of weaker form than those in the existing analyses of other $\ell_1$ regularized algorithms, and has faster guaranteed rate of convergence when the ratio of the $\ell_1$ and spectrum norms of the target inverse matrix diverges to infinity. A simulation study demonstrates the computational feasibility and superb performance of the proposed method. 
Our analysis also provides new performance bounds for the Lasso and scaled Lasso to guarantee higher concentration of the error at a smaller threshold level than previous analyses, and to allow the use of the union bound in column-by-column applications of the scaled Lasso without an adjustment of the penalty level. In addition, the least squares estimation after the scaled Lasso selection is considered and proven to guarantee performance bounds similar to that of the scaled Lasso.",2013,J. Mach. Learn. Res.
