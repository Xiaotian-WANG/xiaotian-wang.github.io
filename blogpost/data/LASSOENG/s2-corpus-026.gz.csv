Acute toxicity of selected herbicides and surfactants to larvae of the midgeChironomus riparius,"The acute toxicities of eight commercial herbicides and two surfactants to early fourth instar larvae of the midgeChironomus riparius were determined under static conditions. The formulated herbicides tested were EradicaneÂ® (EPTC), FargoÂ® (triallate), LassoÂ® (alachlor), ME4 BrominalÂ® (bromoxynil), RamrodÂ® (propachlor), RodeoÂ® (glyphosate), SencorÂ® (metribuzin), and Sutan (+)Â® (butylate); the two surfactants were Activator N.F.Â® and Ortho X-77Â®. In addition, technical grade alachlor, metribuzin, propachlor, and triallate were tested for comparison with the formulated herbicides. The relative toxicity of the commercial formulations, based on percent active ingredient, varied considerably. The EC50 values ranged from 1.23 mg/L for FargoÂ® to 5,600 mg/L for RodeoÂ®. FargoÂ®, ME4 BrominalÂ®, and RamrodÂ® were moderately toxic to midge larvae; LassoÂ®, Sutan (+)Â®, and EradicaneÂ® were slightly toxic; and SencorÂ® and RodeoÂ® were practically non-toxic. The 48-hr EC50 values of the two surfactants were nearly identical and were considered moderately toxic to midges. For two of the herbicides in which the technical grade material was tested, the inert ingredients in the formulations had a significant effect on the toxicity of the active ingredients. FargoÂ® was twice as toxic as technical grade triallate, whereas SencorÂ® was considerably less toxic than technical grade metribuzin. A comparison of the slope function values indicated that the toxic action of all the compounds occurred within a relatively narrow range. Published acute toxicity data on these compounds for other freshwater biota were tabulated and compared with our results. In general, the relative order of toxicity toC. riparius was similar to those for other freshwater invertebrates and fish. Maximum concentrations of each herbicide in bulk runoff during a projected â€œcriticalâ€ runoff event were calculated as a percentage of the application rate lost in a given volume of runoff. A comparison between estimated maximum herbicide concentrations in runoff and results of acute tests indicated that RamrodÂ®, ME4 BrominalÂ®, and LassoÂ® pose the greatest direct risk to midge larvae during a storm event.",1989,Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology
Deriving Solution Value Bounds from the ADMMâˆ—,"This short paper describes a simple subgradient-based techniques for deriving bounds on the optimal solution value when using the ADMM to solve convex optimization problems. The technique requires a bound on the magnitude of some optimal solution vector, but is otherwise completely general. Some computational examples using LASSO problems demonstrate that the technique can produce steadily converging bounds in situations in which standard Lagrangian bounds yield little or no useful information.",2019,
Coordinate descent algorithms for lasso penalized regression,"Imposition of a lasso penalty shrinks parameter estimates toward zero and performs continuous model selection. Lasso penalized regression is capable of handling linear regression problems where the number of predictors far exceeds the number of cases. This paper tests two exceptionally fast algorithms for estimating regression coefficients with a lasso penalty. The previously known l 2 algorithm is based on cyclic coordinate descent. Our new l 1 algorithm is based on greedy coordinate descent and Edgeworth's algorithm for ordinary l 1 regression. Each algorithm relies on a tuning constant that can be chosen by cross-validation. In some regression problems it is natural to group parameters and penalize parameters group by group rather than separately. If the group penalty is proportional to the Euclidean norm of the parameters of the group, then it is possible to majorize the norm and reduce parameter estimation to l 2 regression with a lasso penalty. Thus. the existing algorithm can be extended to novel settings. Each of the algorithms discussed is tested via either simulated or real data or both. The Appendix proves that a greedy form of the l 2 algorithm converges to the minimum value of the objective function.",2008,The Annals of Applied Statistics
From Bayes Calculus to Efficient Integration of Studies,"My thesis contains three main parts: the first part discusses a theoretical development in Bayes calculations, while the latter two parts focus on statistical methods with the applications to genetics. The focus of the talk is on a new meta-analysis approach to identify common predictors from multiple related studies. Identifying molecular signatures for complex diseases remains one major objective in gene expression studies. Commonly used strategies mainly investigate one gene expression study at a time, where the combination of small sample size and a large number of genetic predictors often leads to low detection power and to inaccuracy in the estimation of the set of relevant genes. We present here methodology for improving the power of identifying gene signatures by combining summary statistics from several relevant studies. The group lasso proposed by Yuan and Lin (2006) could be used for this purpose, where the regression coefficients of the same predictor across multiple studies naturally form a group. Their approach is challenged when predictors have heterogeneous effects or effect direction coherence. Motivated by these issues, we introduce a nonparametric approach called Meta-Rank Selection. Our three-step approach first infers the rank of a predictor and its marginal correlation with the response in each individual study, combines the two scores to form a consensus ranking path of all predictors, then selects the relevant predictors along the consensus ranking path. We present theoretical properties of Meta-Rank Selection and use simulations to compare its performance with other methods such as the group lasso. We also discuss its extensions, including ways to incorporate effect direction coherence and tools to deal with strong correlations among predictors.

Chapter 5 Application of Boosting Technique to Ridge Regression 5,"Schapire (1990) introduced boosting as a common method which attempts to boost the precision of any learning algorithm. Boosting is one of the most successful and useful methods introduced in the last eighteen years. The goal of boosting is to improve the performance of weak learning algorithms by combining them in a certain way. The first algorithm of this type was developed by Schapire (1990). The second algorithm, developed by Freund (1995), it was a more efficient boosting algorithm. It was originally designed for classification problems, but it can be extended to regression. Schapire and Freund (1996) came up with the idea of a more practical version of boosting and proposed the algorithm called AdaBoost that combines simple classification rules into more powerful and precise classification algorithms. Friedman (2001) developed boosting methods for regression which are implemented for optimization using the RSS function: this is what we call L2Boosting. Boosting technique can be useful to iteratively fit the current residuals. Duffy and Helmbold (2002) gave a brief overview of boosting and contrasted the classification and regression settings. Buhimann and Yu (2003) proposed an algorithm called L2Boost in linear model. They constructed it from the L2 loss function. L2 loss is suitable for regression. Therefore, they proposed to use L2Boost for a regression problem and not necessarily with Multicollinearity. Boosting of an estimator means that the estimator is applied iteratively to the residuals of the previous iteration. Efron et al. (2004) proposed LARS algorithm as a combination of forward stage-wise linear regression (FSLR), which seems closely related to L2Boost, and the L\ penalized Lasso (see Tibshirani, 1996). Some",2016,
"Water-rock interaction in a zone of lateral flow: A natural example from the active geothermal field and gold-mineralized zone of Beppu (Kyushu Island, Japan)","SummaryBeppu is a water-dominated active geothermal system in Kyushu (Japan). Gold mineralization exists in places within altered Pleistocene volcanites in the southernmost part of this field. A shallow 300 m well was drilled in an alluvial fan deposit made up of unsorted volcanic clasts of andesite and dacite. Water and core samples were collected and a temperature log was carried out. In the depth range of 150-230 m and at temperatures of 126-148Â° C the main authigenic minerals are quartz, calcite, K-feldspar, mixed layers illite/smectite, stilbite and pyrite. The chemical data of the waters indicate that mixing occurs between shallow bicarbonate waters and deep Na-Cl geothermal waters in the outflow zone. The authigenic mineral assemblages found in the well are analogous to those found in the epithermal gold deposits of southern Kyushu. Au concentration data for the hydrothermal springs of Beppu (0.53 Î¼g/kg) indicate that the fluids found in the borehole at 148Â° C could theoretically deposit gold. It is reasonable to hypothesise that a process of mixing between deep Na-Cl fluids and shallow Ca-HCO3-SO4 fluids were responsible for massive silicate deposition, accompanied in places by Au mineralizations.ZusammenfassungBeppu ist ein geothermales System auf der Insel Kyushu, Japan, in der Wasser die dominante Rolle spielt. Goldvererzungen treten stellenweise in umgewandelten pleistozÃ¤nen Vulkaniten im sÃ¼dlichsten Teil des Gebietes auf. Ein 300 m tiefes Bohrloch wurde in einem alluvialen Sedimentations-FÃ¤cher, der aus unsortierten vulkanischen Klasten, aus Andesit und Dazit besteht, niedergebracht. Wasserproben und Kernproben wurden genommen und die Temperaturen im Bohrloch systematisch gemessen. In Tiefen von 150â€“230 m und bei Temperaturen von 126â€“148Â°C sind die wichtigsten autigen gebildeten Minerale Quarz, Calcit, K-Feldspat, Illit/Smectit, Stilbit und Pyrit. Der Chemismus der WÃ¤sser zeigt, daÃŸ eine Mischung zwischen seichten Bikarbonat-WÃ¤ssern und aus der Tiefe stammenden Na-Cl geothermalen WÃ¤ssern erfolgt. Die autigenen Mineralassoziationen in diesem. Bohrloch sind vergleichbar mit denen in epithermalen GoldlagerstÃ¤tten des sÃ¼dlichen Kyushu. Auf der Basis von existierenden Goldkonzentrationsdaten fÃ¼r die hydrothermalen Quellen auf Beppu (0.53 Î¼g/kg) lÃ¤ÃŸt sich zeigen, daÃŸ die Fluide, die in dem Bohrloch bei 148 angetroffen wurden, theoretisch Gold absetzen kÃ¶nnten. Daher lÃ¤ÃŸt sich die Theorie vertreten, daÃŸ MischungsvorgÃ¤nge zwischen einem aus der Tiefe stammenden Na-Cl Fluid und einem oberflÃ¤chennahen Ca-HCO3-SO4 Wasser fÃ¼r die massive Silikatausscheidung verantwortlich waren, die stellenweise von Goldmineralisation begleitet wurden.",1992,Mineralogy and Petrology

Defensive synergy : the antipredatory role of glass spicules in Caribbean demosponges,"Many sponge species produce secondary metabolites that deter predation. Sponges also 
contain siliceous spicules, but previous studies have provided little evidence that spicules offer 
any defense against generalist fish predators. However, feeding assays in past investigations 
tested sponge skeletal elements in isolation, and did not consider whether they may enhance 
chemical defenses. To determine whether the two components have an additive, antagonistic, or 
synergistic interaction, crude organic extracts and spicules from 8 Caribbean sponge species 
were isolated and tested in laboratory assays. The sponges used included one chemically 
defended reef sponge (Agelas clathrodes) and seven sponges known to be intermediately 
deterrent. These included six reef species (Calyx podotypa, Cinachyra alloclada, Cribrochalina 
vasculum, Niphates digitalis, Rhaphidophlus juniperinus, and Xestospongia muta) and one 
mangrove species (Tedania ignis). Extracts and spicules were used in various concentrations, 
both individually and in combination, in laboratory feeding assays with the bluehead wrasse, 
Thalassoma bifasciatum. A SAS based GENMOD procedure based on an isobolographic 
analysis model was used for statistical comparisons. Four sponges (A. clathrodes, C. alloclada, 
R. juniperinus, and X. muta) showed evidence of synergisms. Of these species, synergy in C. 
alloclada, R. juniperinus, and X. muta was caused by approximate natural concentrations of 
extracts and spicules. Extracts of A. clathrodes were deterrent, but combination assays required 
unnatural reductions in extract concentrations and increases in spicule concentrations to show the 
synergistic effect. Contrary to previous findings, spicules from Cribrochalina vasculum and X. 
muta were deterrent at natural concentrations. These results indicate that, for some sponges, 
structural elements may serve to enhance chemical defenses against consumers.",2009,

Ultra-Deep Targeted Sequencing Does Not Identify MM Patients with Different Prognosis: Results from a Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revealed new insight into the complexity of clonal and subclonal architecture of multiple myeloma (MM). The introduction of targeted studies allows the detection of mutations with very low allele frequencies at affordable price. However, there is few information about the prognostic impact of this mutational profile in series of homogeneously treated MM patients. In this study, we analyzed the most frequently mutated genes in MM from patients included in a randomized clinical trial applying the highest read depth to date. We performed a correlation study between our results and cytogenetics aberrations and clinical outcomes. We used Ampliseq Library Kit 2.0 to target 77 genes (M3Pv2.0 panel) related to critical pathophysiological pathways, associated to drug resistance or targetable with molecular drugs in MM. We sequenced DNA (15ng) from CD138+ purified plasma cells from 80 MM patients at diagnosis included in GEM2010MAS65 clinical trial. We sequenced at an average read depth of 1500X and using Ion Proton sequencer (Thermo Fisher, USA, PaloAlto, CA). We used Ion Reporter software applying in-house modifications in call variants process. We also sequenced DNA from CD138 negative population in 30% of patients in order to filter out potential artifacts and stablish conditions for excluding germline variants. We first fitted a cox-proportional hazard model to predict survival and a second approach using a penalized regression LASSO. We identified 137 gene mutations in the 80 patients analyzed, 54 mutations were predicted pathogenic by Shif and Poliphen and 65 have been described in COSMIC database. 85% of patients harbored at least 1 mutation. The most frequently mutated genes were KRAS (16%) , DIS3 (15%) , NRAS (13%) , BRAF (6%) , and TP53 (5%) , accounting for the 54% of the total number of mutations. The most frequently mutated pathways were RAS and NFKB in 34% and 28% of patients respectively. Mutational allele frequency for KRAS , BRAF and TP53 was, in all cases, lower than 50% while DIS3 showed mutations in a broad range (from 2 to 85%). Only one patient presented one mutation in NRAS at 73 % of allele frequency. For patients with more than one mutation, two different scenarios have been found. Some patients showed several genes mutated in a similar allele frequency values. On the contrary, a complex subclonal structure was confirmed in 3 patients, with mutations at very different clonal frequency. CD138 negative fraction was sequenced to confirm that these mutations were exclusive of plasma cells. The first of them had two mutations in DIS3 at 8 and 53% of allele frequency, second in KRAS and DIS3 at 13 and 63% respectively and the third in NRAS and IFNGR2 at 5 and 37% respectively. We found no differences in the survival based on pathway, mutational allele frequency or number of mutations. We also investigated pairwise associations between events and we not found significant correlations (Figure 1). Cox-proportional hazard model only showed a negative impact in survival of patients with TP53 mutations. This ultra-deep targeted sequencing strategy is able to detect mutations in most of patients, at very low allele frequency and using a minimal amount of DNA. Despite of its huge capacity to detect mutations, we have not identified new prognostic factors in MM patients treated with highly efficient therapies. However, this study again confirms the complexity of the genomic landscape of MM and the great heterogeneity between patients. The role of theses mutations at relapse as well as in the subsequent treatment effectiveness remains unknown and should be preferably investigated in larger cohorts of homogeneously treated MM patients.

Return to the Sea: The Life and Evolutionary Times of Marine Mammals,"Marine mammals are charismatic and iconic representatives of the oceans. With a long evolutionary history, they are textbook examples of evolutionary processes that have adapted them to a life in a medium much different than that from which their ancestors came. People of all ages are mesmerized by the variety and diversity that we see in marine mammals. This interest raises questions, such as: when and where did the various marine mammal lineages originate; how did they make the transition from land to sea; and how have physical drivers influenced marine mammal evolution? The introductory chapter of this book offers good, up-to-date information regarding identification of species using both traditional methods and novel methods such as barcoding. The subjects of taxonomy, phylogeny, and speciation are very well covered and explained. The second chapter focuses mainly on explaining which physical drivers have shaped and influenced marine mammal evolution and how that was accomplished. Accompanying time scales, showing climatic events and events in marine mammal evolution throughout the Cenozoic, help the reader further grasp the influence of physical drivers on marine ecosystems. This has been an area of focus in recent years, and was even the subject of a symposium during the 70th Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. Chapters 3â€“5 address the evolutionary history, ecology, and biology of the different marine mammal groups. Each chapter offers descriptions and information on a family-by-family basis for each group, giving the reader enough information to provide a good idea of their diversity and ecology. I particularly liked the inclusion, in Chapter 5, of extinct marine mammal groups such as desmostylians and thalassocnines (aquatic sloths), which are sometimes forgotten. Chapter 6 covers ecology and conservation, and the up-todate information and its broad spectrum, from food webs to what we humans are doing to preserve endangered marine mammals, is very welcome. For readers who might become more interested in the subjects covered by this chapter, the information provided offers a good starting point for further study. Throughout the book terms and concepts that are normally used by biologists and paleontologists, but might not be familiar to beginners or people outside these fields, are outlined and defined. This information is supplemented by a glossary that follows the final chapter. Throughout each chapter, short essays focusing on different topics help the reader further understand the topics raised. In addition, each chapter benefits greatly from the illustrations by James L. Sumich and Carl Buell. Carlâ€™s reconstructions of extant and extinct taxa are well regarded amongst marine mammal paleontologists and others. I could only wish they were in full color instead of grayscale, but Iâ€™m sure this helps to keep the cost of the book low. One weak spot I found in this book regards the connection between behavioral and ecological studies of modern marine mammals and the fossil record. The book could have benefited from a brief mention of how an understanding of modern marine mammal behavior can be applied to the study of fossil marine mammals, such as understanding pathologies (e.g., Beatty and Rothschild, 2008) or how using stranding records of modern marine mammals (e.g., Pyenson, 2011) can help us interpret their fossil record. The other is that it does not mention the subject of sirenian multispecies communities. This is a topic that has been covered, or at least mentioned, in the literature since the late 1970s (Domning, 1978), and more recently by Domning (2001) and VÃ©lez-Juarbe et al. (2012). Extant sirenian ecology and diversity are very different from the past, which is something that needs to be taken into account when covering the subjects of their evolutionary history and the conservation of modern species. Putting that aside, I highly recommend this book. It is very complete and makes a good read for both professional and nonprofessional paleontologists and biologists, not to mention its low cost, which makes it affordable for many people.",2013,
Upweighting rare favourable alleles increases long-term genetic gain in genomic selection programs,"BackgroundThe short-term impact of using different genomic prediction (GP) models in genomic selection has been intensively studied, but their long-term impact is poorly understood. Furthermore, long-term genetic gain of genomic selection is expected to improve by using Janninkâ€™s weighting (JW) method, in which rare favourable marker alleles are upweighted in the selection criterion. In this paper, we extend the JW method by including an additional parameter to decrease the emphasis on rare favourable alleles over the time horizon, with the purpose of further improving the long-term genetic gain. We call this new method dynamic weighting (DW). The paper explores the long-term impact of different GP models with or without weighting methods.MethodsDifferent selection criteria were tested by simulating a population of 500 animals with truncation selection of five males and 50 females. Selection criteria included unweighted and weighted genomic estimated breeding values using the JW or DW methods, for which ridge regression (RR) and Bayesian lasso (BL) were used to estimate marker effects. The impacts of these selection criteria were compared under three genetic architectures, i.e. varying numbers of QTL for the trait and for two time horizons of 15 (TH15) or 40 (TH40) generations.ResultsFor unweighted GP, BL resulted in up to 21.4% higher long-term genetic gain and 23.5% lower rate of inbreeding under TH40 than RR. For weighted GP, DW resulted in 1.3 to 5.5% higher long-term gain compared to unweighted GP. JW, however, showed a 6.8% lower long-term genetic gain relative to unweighted GP when BL was used to estimate the marker effects. Under TH40, both DW and JW obtained significantly higher genetic gain than unweighted GP. With DW, the long-term genetic gain was increased by up to 30.8% relative to unweighted GP, and also increased by 8% relative to JW, although at the expense of a lower short-term gain.ConclusionsIrrespective of the number of QTL simulated, BL is superior to RR in maintaining genetic variance and therefore results in higher long-term genetic gain. Moreover, DW is a promising method with which high long-term genetic gain can be expected within a fixed time frame.",2015,"Genetics, Selection, Evolution : GSE"
"Ore minerals in the telluride-bearing gold-silver ores of Salida, Indonesia, with special reference to the distribution of selenium","Te-Se-bearing gold-silver ores from Salida in Sumatra, Indonesia, show carbonate and sulfidic diffusion bands in quartz incrustations. The sulfidic diffusion bands show a fine diffusion zoning with: 1. an earliest or inner zone with concentrations of Zn, Cu, Fe, S (sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrite); 2. an intermediate zone with concentrations of Pb, Au, Ag, S, Te, Se (galena and Au-Ag-tellurides in Te-bearing parageneses; galena, electrum and acanthite in Te-free parageneses); and 3. a zone of As-bearing minerals (tennantite, enargite or luzonite, arsenpolybasite) superimposed on the first two zones. In the telluride-bearing ores paragenetic relations suggest that galena, altaite, hessite, and Î³-phase and â€œxâ€-phase solid solutions originally crystallized above about 120 Â°C; on cooling this assemblage equilibrated into one stable below 50 Â°C and consisting of galena, altaite, hessite, hessite-sylvanite intergrowths, and hessite-petzite aggregates. Se is concentrated in sulfides of the intermediate diffusion zones; microprobe analyses indicate up to 4.0 weight percent Se in some acanthites and up to 0.45 weight percent Se in some galenas; arsenpolybasite also contains up to 4.0 weight percent Se but only when replacing seleniferous acanthite. The concentration of Se with Pb, Au, Ag, S, Te in intermediate diffusion zones is ascribed to solution differentiation during solute diffusion.

Beyond easy answers: facing the entanglements of violence and psychosis.,"School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of WesternSydney, Sydney, AustraliaIn the aftermath of mass shootings (most recently, the NavyYard and Newtown tragedies), media attention predictably turnsto the actual or potential role of â€œmental illness,â€ particularlypsychosis, in otherwise seemingly un-understandable manifes-tations of violence.

$\textsf{LoPub}$ : High-Dimensional Crowdsourced Data Publication With Local Differential Privacy,"High-dimensional crowdsourced data collected from numerous users produces rich knowledge about our society; however, it also brings unprecedented privacy threats to the participants. Local differential privacy (LDP), a variant of differential privacy, is recently proposed as a state-of-the-art privacy notion. Unfortunately, achieving LDP on high-dimensional crowdsourced data publication raises great challenges in terms of both computational efficiency and data utility. To this end, based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and Lasso regression, we first propose efficient multi-dimensional joint distribution estimation algorithms with LDP. Then, we develop a local differentially private high-dimensional data publication algorithm (LoPub) by taking advantage of our distribution estimation techniques. In particular, correlations among multiple attributes are identified to reduce the dimensionality of crowdsourced data, thus speeding up the distribution learning process and achieving high data utility. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our multivariate distribution estimation scheme significantly outperforms existing estimation schemes in terms of both communication overhead and estimation speed. Moreover, LoPub can keep, on average, 80% and 60% accuracy over the released datasets in terms of support vector machine and random forest classification, respectively.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security
Op-gbev170021 1..16 ++,"Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules are attached to and removed from cellular proteins in a dynamic and highly regulated manner. Deubiquitinating enzymes are critical to this process, and the genetic catalogue of deubiquitinating enzymes expanded greatly over the course of evolution. Extensive functional redundancy has been noted among the 93 members of the human deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) superfamily. This is especially true of genes that were generated by duplication (termed paralogs) as they often retain considerable sequence similarity. Because complete redundancy in systems should be eliminated by selective pressure, we theorized that many overlapping DUBs must have significant and unique spatiotemporal roles that can be evaluated inanevolutionary context.Wehavedeterminedtheevolutionaryhistoryof theentire classofdeubiquitinatingenzymes, including the sequence and means of duplication for all paralogous pairs. To establish their uniqueness, we have investigated cell-type specificity in developmental and adult contexts, and have investigated the coemergence of substrates from the same duplication events. Our analysis has revealed examples of DUB gene subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, and nonfunctionalization.",2017,
Ten-year surveillance of drug-resistant malaria in Burkina Faso (1982-1991).,"To understand the evolution of drug-resistant forms of malaria in time and in space, we carried out an analysis of the results of a series of passive and active surveys conducted in Burkina Faso between 1982 and 1991. A total of 607 tests for resistance to chloroquine and mefloquine were carried out in vitro and 3,679 tests for resistance to chloroquine, quinine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine were performed in vivo. The surveys principally involved the two main cities of Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. However, another 10 locations representing the three different zones of malaria transmission were also studied. The first cases of Plasmodium falciparum resistant to chloroquine in vitro were reported in 1983, but it was only in 1988 that in vivo resistance appeared. The first cases of in vitro resistance to mefloquine were noted in 1987 while chloroquine sensitivity at a high rate (15.8%), which decreased during the following years. The prevalence of resistance to chloroquine increased in parallel to this decrease in sensitivity to an overall peak of 41% in vitro and 16% in vivo in 1990. These rates then decreased to 3% and 6%, respectively, in 1991. This pattern of decreasing resistance was broadly similar in all sites except for the town of Bobo-Dioulasso, where the level of resistance remained stable at approximately 14% from 1988 to 1991. Only two cases of resistance in vivo to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine were noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene
A LASSO Method to Identify Protein Signature Predicting Post-transplant Renal Graft Survival,"Identifying novel biomarkers to predict renal graft survival is important in post-transplant clinical practice. Serum creatinine, currently the most popular surrogate biomarker, offers limited information on the underlying allograft profiles. It is known to perform unsatisfactorily to predict renal function. In this paper, we apply a LASSO machine-learning algorithm in the Cox proportional hazards model to identify promising proteins that are associated with the hazard of allograft loss after renal transplantation, motivated by a clinical pilot study that collected 47 patients receiving renal transplants at the University of Michigan Hospital. We assess the association of 17 proteins previously identified by Cibrik et al.Â (PROTEOMICS Clin Appl 7(11â€“12): 839â€“849, 2013) with allograft rejection in our regularized Cox regression analysis, where the LASSO variable selection method is applied to select important proteins that predict the hazard of allograft loss. We also develop a post-selection inference to further investigate the statistical significance of the proteins on the hazard of allograft loss, and conclude that two proteins KIM-1 and VEGF-R2 are important protein markers for risk prediction.",2017,Statistics in Biosciences
An unexpected connection between Bayes A-optimal designs and the group lasso,We show that the A-optimal design optimization problem over m design points in $${\mathbb {R}}^n$$Rn is equivalent to minimizing a quadratic function plus a group lasso sparsity inducing term over $$n\times m$$nÃ—m real matrices. This observation allows to describe several new algorithms for A-optimal design based on splitting and block coordinate decomposition. These techniques are well known and proved powerful to treat large scale problems in machine learning and signal processing communities. The proposed algorithms come with rigorous convergence guarantees and convergence rate estimate stemming from the optimization literature. Performances are illustrated on synthetic benchmarks and compared to existing methods for solving the optimal design problem.,2018,Statistical Papers
Detection of malignant pleural mesothelioma in exhaled breath by multicapillary column/ion mobility spectrometry (MCC/IMS).,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is predominantly caused by previous asbestos exposure. Diagnosis often happens in advanced stages restricting any therapeutic perspectives. Early stage detection via breath analysis was explored using multicapillary column/ion mobility spectrometry (MCC/IMS) to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath of MPM patients in comparison to former occupational asbestos-exposed and non-exposed controls. Breath and background samples of 23 MPM patients, 22 asymptomatic former asbestos (AEx) workers and 21 healthy non-asbestos exposed persons were taken for analysis. After background correction, we performed a logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression to select the most important VOCs, followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. MPM patients were discriminated from both controls with 87% sensitivity, 70% specificity and respective positive and negative predictive values of 61% and 91%. The overall accuracy was 76% and the area under the ROC-curve was 0.81. AEx individuals could be discriminated from MPM patients with 87% sensitivity, 86% specificity and respective positive and negative predictive values of 87% and 86%. The overall accuracy was 87% with an area under the ROC-curve of 0.86. Breath analysis by MCC/IMS allows MPM patients to be discriminated from controls and holds promise for further investigation as a screening tool for former asbestos-exposed persons at risk of developing MPM.",2016,Journal of breath research
Lasso-based forecast combinations for forecasting realized variances,"Volatility forecasts are key inputs in financial analysis. While lasso based forecasts have shown to perform well in many applications, their use to obtain volatility forecasts has not yet received much attention in the literature. Lasso estimators produce parsimonious forecast models. Our forecast combination approach hedges against the risk of selecting a wrong degree of model parsimony. Apart from the standard lasso, we consider several lasso extensions that account for the dynamic nature of the forecast model. We apply forecast combined lasso estimators in a comprehensive forecasting exercise using realized variance time series of ten major international stock market indices. We find the lasso extended 'ordered lasso' to give the most accurate realized variance forecasts. Multivariate forecast models, accounting for volatility spillovers between different stock markets, outperform univariate forecast models for longer forecast horizons.",2016,arXiv: Applications
Scalable approaches for analysis of human genome-wide expression and genetic variation data,"One of the major tasks in bioinformatics and computational biology is prediction of phenotype from molecular data. Predicting phenotypes such as disease opens the way to better diagnostic tools, potentially identifying disease earlier than would be detectable using other methods. Examining molecular signatures rather than clinical phenotypes may help refine disease classification and prediction procedures, since many diseases are known to have multiple molecular subtypes with differing etiology, prognosis, and treatment options. Beyond prediction itself, identifying predictive markers aids our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying phenotypes such as disease, generating hypotheses that can be tested in the lab. The aims of this thesis are to develop effective and efficient computational and statistical tools for analysing large scale gene expression and genetic datasets, with an emphasis on predictive models. Several key challenges include high dimensionality of the data, which has important statistical and computational implications, noisy data due to measurement error and stochasticity of the underlying biology, and maintaining biological interpretability without sacrificing predictive performance. We begin by examining the problem of predicting breast cancer metastasis and relapse from gene expression data. We present an alternative approach based on gene set statistics. Second, we address the problem of analysing large human case/control genetic (single nucleotide polymorphism) data, and present an efficient and scalable algorithm for fitting sparse models to large datasets. Third, we apply sparse models to genetic case/control datasets from eight complex human diseases, evaluating how each one can be predicted from genotype. Fourth, we apply sparse models lasso methods to a multi-omic dataset consisting of genetic variation, gene expression, and serum metabolites, for reconstruction of genetic regulatory networks. Finally, we propose a novel multi-task statistical approach, intended for modelling multiple correlated phenotypes. In summary, this thesis discusses a range of predictive models and applies them to a wide range of problems, including gene expression, genetic, and multi-omic datasets. We demonstrate that such models, and particularly sparse models, are computationally feasible and can scale to large datasets, provide increased insight into the biological causes of disease, and for some diseases have high predictive performance, allowing high-confidence disease diagnosis to be made based on genetic data.",2012,

GEO is easy to implement, has only one free parameter to adjust, does not make use of derivatives and can be applied to constrained or unconstrained problems, and to non-convex or even disjoint design spaces with any combination of continuous, discrete, or integer variables. The application reported here concerns the optimum design of a simplified configuration of the Brazilian Multi-mission Platform (in Portuguese, Plataforma Multi-missÃ£o, PMM) thermal control subsystem, comprising five radiators and one battery heater. The PMM is a multi-purpose space platform to be used in different types of missions such as Earth observation, scientific, or meteorological data collecting.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Signature of Pain Anticipation and Clinical Depressive Symptomatology,"Author(s): Kadlec, Molly | Advisor(s): Tosun-Turgut, Duygu | Abstract: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study tested the hypothesis that individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) are more likely to anticipate negative outcomes. The participants included thirty-one (15 females) unmedicated adults diagnosed with MDD and twenty-two (11 females) healthy control subjects with no history of MDD. fMRI data were collected during an event-related pain-anticipation paradigm, during which participants were cued to anticipate painful heat stimuli. Stimuli were delivered at high (moderately painful sensation) or low (mild painful sensation) intensity, and all cues were either known (high and low pain cues), or unknown (50% probability of high or low pain, which was not known to the participant), with a total of fourteen known and fourteen unknown anticipation trials. Based on prior findings regarding the importance of the insula cortex during pain anticipation, twelve insular regions (six on each side) were examined. Single-subject multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to create subject-specific activation maps for each anticipation condition. The mean activation (beta coefficient) was extracted within each insular region and was subjected to linear regression by way of a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Following LASSO regression, prediction analysis was conducted on the test set (activation maps from fourteen unknown anticipation trials), based on the correlation with the training set (activation maps from fourteen known anticipation trials). Across each unknown anticipation trial, participantsâ€™ anticipation was classified as either high pain (HP) or low pain (LP). Several results were observed. First, we found that, within the chosen insular regions, neurobiological signatures of high and low pain anticipation were distinguishable at a high sensitivity. Second, the anterior short gyrus on the right side showed the highest deterministic beta coefficient in anticipatory predictions in our study. Third, we found that across both groups more of the unknown anticipatory conditions were labeled as HP. Fourth, in the current sample, we found no significant relationship with overall depressive symptoms severity and anticipatory labeling. Nevertheless, as hypothesized, significantly more cases of unknown anticipation were labeled as HP in the depressed cohort than in the control group (chi= 3.9; p l 0.05).",2018,
Finite convergence of proximal-gradient inertial algorithms combining dry friction with Hessian-driven damping,"In a Hilbert space H, we introduce a new class of proximal-gradient algorithms with finite convergence properties. These algorithms naturally occur as discrete temporal versions of an inertial differential inclusion which is damped under the joint action of three dampings: a viscous damping, a geometric damping driven by the Hessian and a dry friction damping. The function f : H â†’ R to be minimized is supposed to be differentiable (not necessarily convex), and enters the algorithm via its gradient. The dry friction damping function Ï† : H â†’ R+ is convex with a sharp minimum at the origin, (typically Ï†(x) = râ€–xâ€– with r > 0). It enters the algorithm via its proximal mapping, which acts as a soft threshold operator on the velocities. The geometrical damping driven by the Hessian intervenes in the dynamics in the form âˆ‡2f(x(t))áº‹(t). By treating this term as the time derivative of âˆ‡f(x(t)), this gives, in discretized form, first-order algorithms. The Hessian driven damping allows to control and to attenuate the oscillations which occur naturally with the inertial effect. The convergence results tolerate the presence of errors, under the sole assumption of their asymptotic convergence to zero. Then, replacing the potential function f by its Moreau envelope, we extend the results to the case of a nonsmooth convex function f . In this case, the algorithm involves the proximal operators of f and Ï† separately. Several variants of this algorithm are considered, including the case of the Nesterov accelerated gradient method. We then consider the extension in the case of additive composite optimization, thus leading to splitting methods. Numerical experiments are given for Lasso-type problems. The performance profiles, as a comparison tool, highlight the effectiveness of two variants of the Nesterov accelerated method with dry friction and Hessian-driven viscous damping.

Lasso logistic regression based approach for extracting plants coregenes responding to abiotic stresses,"Sparse methods have a significant advantage of reducing gene expression data complexity to make them comprehensible and interpretable. In this paper, based on Lasso Logistic Regression (LLR), we propose a novel approach to extract plant characteristic gene set, namely coregenes, responding to abiotic stresses. Firstly, to obtain the regression coefficients, the lasso logistic regression was performed according to the samples. Then, the regression coefficients were sorted by the absolute value of them. Finally, the corresponding genes of the nonzero entries of the coefficients are selected as the coregene. Each of coregene extracted can capture the changes of the samples belong to the same condition. The experimental results show that the proposed LLR-based method is efficient to extract the coregenes concerning straight with the stresses.",2011,The Fourth International Workshop on Advanced Computational Intelligence

Radiomics for lung adenocarcinoma manifesting as pure ground-glass nodules: invasive prediction,"To investigate the value of radiomics based on CT imaging in predicting invasive adenocarcinoma manifesting as pure ground-glass nodules (pGGNs). This study enrolled 395 pGGNs with histopathology-confirmed benign nodules or adenocarcinoma. A total of 396 radiomic features were extracted from each labeled nodule. A Rad-score was constructed with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in the training set. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to establish the radiographic model and the combined radiographicâ€“radiomics model. The predictive performance was validated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis, an individual prediction nomogram was developed and the clinical utility was assessed. Five radiomic features and four radiographic features were selected for predicting the invasive lesions. The combined radiographicâ€“radiomics model (AUC 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69â€“0.86) performed better than the radiographic model (AUC 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62â€“0.81) and Rad-score (AUC 0.72; 95% CI, 0.63â€“0.81) in the validation set. The clinical utility of the individualized prediction nomogram developed using the Rad-score, margin, spiculation, and size was confirmed in the validation set. The decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated that using a model with Rad-score to predict the invasive lesion would be more beneficial than that without Rad-score and the clinical model. The proposed radiomics-based nomogram that incorporated the Rad-score, margin, spiculation, and size may be utilized as a noninvasive biomarker for the assessment of invasive prediction in patients with pGGNs. â€¢ CT-based radiomics analysis helps invasive prediction manifested as pGGNs. â€¢ The combined radiographicâ€“radiomics model may be utilized as a noninvasive biomarker for predicting invasive lesion for pGGNs. â€¢ Radiomics-based individual nomogram may serve as a vital decision support tool to identify invasive pGGNs, obviating further workup and blind follow-up.",2020,European Radiology
"Histology, ultrastructure, and in vitro steroidogenesis of the testes of two male phenotypes of the protogynous fish, Thalassoma duperrey (Labridae).","Species with multiple male reproductive phenotypes may serve as model systems to study the relationship between form and function in reproduction. Large and small males of the protogynous wrasse, Thalassoma duperrey differ in reproductive behavior, gonad morphology, and gonadal steroid production. Initial-phase (IP) males are small males that spawn in groups. They have large testes with high sperm production. Terminal-phase (TP) males are large, defend temporary spawning territories, and spawn individually with females. TP males are derived from either IP males or from sex-changed females. Regardless of origin, TP males have much smaller testes than do IP males, but steroid-producing Leydig cells in the gonads of TP males appear more numerous and better developed. Testes of TP males produce more testosterone (T) and especially 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) in vitro than do testes of IP males, and the production is more responsive to salmon gonadotropin. 11-KT was the major metabolite produced by incubating the gonads of TP males with 14C-labeled steroid precursors. In vitro 11-KT production was correlated with plasma levels of 11-KT in TP males and these levels were significantly higher than those of IP males. The in vitro conversion of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone to 17 alpha, 20 beta-progestogen (17 alpha, 20 beta-P) for both types of males was similar, and was highest in winter when spawning occurred every day. Basal production of 17 alpha, 20 beta-P was similar in IP and TP male testes, and was enhanced by gonadotropin. The enzyme 20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, responsible for the conversion of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone to 17 alpha, 20 beta-P resided in the sperm. These results indicate a function of 17 alpha, 20 beta-P in male reproductive function, probably spermiation, and a relationship of Leydig cell development and high levels of 11-KT production to the terminal male phenotype, perhaps reproductive or aggressive behavior, rather than to male gametogenesis per se.",1991,General and comparative endocrinology
GBS-Based Genomic Selection for Pea Grain Yield under Severe Terminal Drought.,"Terminal drought is the main stress that limits pea ( L.) grain yield in Mediterranean-climate regions. This study provides an unprecedented assessment of the predictive ability of genomic selection (GS) for grain yield under severe terminal drought using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data. Additional aims were to assess the GS predictive ability for different GBS data quality filters and GS models, comparing intrapopulation with interpopulation GS predictive ability and to perform genome-wide association (GWAS) studies. The yield and onset of flowering of 315 lines from three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations issued by connected crosses between three elite cultivars were assessed under a field rainout shelter. We defined an adjusted yield, which is associated with intrinsic drought tolerance, as the yield deviation from the value expected as a function of onset of flowering (which correlated negatively with grain yield). Total polymorphic markers ranged from approximately 100 (minimum of eight reads per locus, maximum 10% genotype missing data) to over 7500 markers (minimum of four reads, maximum 50% missing rate). Best predictions were provided by Bayesian Lasso (BL) or ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (rrBLUP), rather than support vector regression (SVR) models, with at least 400-500 markers. Intrapopulation GS predictive ability exceeded 0.5 for yield and onset of flowering in all populations and approached 0.4 for the adjusted yield of a population with high trait variation. Genomic selection was preferable to phenotypic selection in terms of predicted yield gains. Interpopulation GS predictive ability varied largely depending on the pair of populations. GWAS revealed extensive colocalization of markers associated with high yield and early flowering and suggested that they are concentrated in a few genomic regions.",2017,The plant genome

While they are closely related to the well-known techniques such as Lasso and Dantzig Selector, these estimators come with efficiently verifiable guaranties of performance. By optimizing these bounds with respect to the method parameters we are able to construct the estimators which possess better statistical properties than the commonly used ones. We link our performance estimations to the well known results of Compressive Sensing and justify our proposed approach with an oracle inequality which links the properties of the recovery algorithms and the best estimation performance when the signal support is known. We also show how the estimates can be computed using the Non-Euclidean Basis Pursuit algorithm.",2011,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
"Magnetic Microlassos for Reversible Cargo Capture, Transport, and Release.","Microbot propulsion has seen increasing interest in recent years as artificial methods that overcome the well-established reversible and challenging nature of microscale fluid mechanics. While controlled movement is an important feature of microbot action, many envisioned applications also involve cargo transport where microbots must be able to load and unload contents on command while tolerating complex solution chemistry. Here we introduce a physical method that uses flexible and linked superparamagnetic colloidal chains, which can form closed rings or ""lassos"" in the presence of a planar rotating magnetic field. By adding an additional AC magnetic field along the direction perpendicular to the substrate, we can orient the lasso at a tilted camber angle. We show that these magnetic lassos can roll at substantial velocities, with precise spatial control by manipulating both field strength and phase lag. Moreover, the lasso can curl around and capture cargo tightly and transport it based on a wheel-type mechanism. At the targeted destination, cargo is easily released upon field removal and the lasso can be readily reused. Since the entire process is physically controlled with no chemistry for attachment or disengagement involved, our system can potentially be used for transporting diverse types of cargo under different solution conditions.",2017,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids

"Factors Associated with Vitamin D Testing, Deficiency, Intake, and Supplementation in Patients with Chronic Pain.","Vitamin D deficiency is a public health issue, with reports of six- to twenty-five-fold rise in vitamin D testing. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to many chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, depression, and chronic pain. Identifying factors associated with risk of deficiency in individuals with chronic pain will help minimize time and cost. This study aims to examine the factors associated with vitamin D testing, intake, and physician-advised supplementation in individuals with chronic pain. Using a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 465 individuals with chronic pain. These data were analyzed using penalized logistic regression with the LASSO technique. Fifty-seven percent reported being tested for vitamin D, about 40% reported being diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency, and of those who had been tested, 60% reported taking vitamin D supplementation. The findings suggest older age (OR 3.12, CI [1.02, 9.50]) and higher mean pain intensity score (OR 2.02, CI [1.13, 3.59]) increased an individual's chance of being vitamin D deficient. Unemployment or on leave due to pain (OR 1.79, [CI 1.03, 3.11]), part-time employment (OR 1.86, CI [1.02, 3.39]), and being a resident of Australia (OR 2.32, CI [1.13, 4.72]) increased chances of being tested for vitamin D. Being diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency (OR 6.67, CI [2.75, 16.19]), unemployed or on leave due to pain (OR 3.71, CI [1.25, 11.00]), and in part-time employment (OR 2.69, CI [0.86, 8.38]) were associated with physician-advised vitamin D supplementation. Our results may have practical implications, as identifying pretest risk factors may assist in identifying who is at risk of vitamin D deficiency, whom to test, and when to treat.",2018,Journal of dietary supplements
SÃ©lection de groupes de variables corrÃ©lÃ©es en grande dimension,"Le contexte de cette these est la selection de variables en grande dimension a l'aide de procedures de regression regularisee en presence de redondance entre variables explicatives. Parmi les variables candidates, on suppose que seul un petit nombre est reellement pertinent pour expliquer la reponse. Dans ce cadre de grande dimension, les approches classiques de type Lasso voient leurs performances se degrader lorsque la redondance croit, puisqu'elles ne tiennent pas compte de cette derniere. Regrouper au prealable ces variables peut pallier ce defaut, mais necessite usuellement la calibration de parametres supplementaires. L'approche proposee combine regroupement et selection de variables dans un souci d'interpretabilite et d'amelioration des performances. D'abord une Classification Ascendante Hierarchique (CAH) fournit a chaque niveau une partition des variables en groupes. Puis le Group-lasso est utilise a partir de l'ensemble des groupes de variables des differents niveaux de la CAH a parametre de regularisation fixe. Choisir ce dernier fournit alors une liste de groupe candidats issus potentiellement de differents niveaux. Le choix final des groupes est obtenu via une procedure de tests multiples. La procedure proposee exploite la structure hierarchique de la CAH et des ponderations dans le Group-lasso. Cela permet de reduire considerablement la complexite algorithmique induite par la flexibilite.",2016,
Predicting Outcomes in Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Treated With Standard of Care,"In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), predictive modeling may contribute to targeted drug development by enrichment of the study populations enrolled in clinical trials of DLBCL investigational drugs to include patients with lower likelihood of responding to standard of care. In clinical practice, predictive modeling has the potential to optimize therapy choices in DLBCL. The objectives of this study were to create a model for predicting health outcomes in patients with DLBCL treated with standard of care and determine informative predictors of health outcomes for patients with DLBCL. This was a retrospective observational study using data extracted from the IMS Health Database between September 2007 and April 2015. Patients were â©¾18â€‰years of age with a DLBCL diagnosis. The index date was the date of the first DLBCL diagnosis. Patients were followed until outcome occurrence, defined as progression to a later line of therapy after â©¾60â€‰days from the end of a previous therapy or stem cell transplantation. Patients were categorized into three cohorts depending on the post-index observation period: â©½1â€‰year, â©½3â€‰years, or â©½5â€‰years. Lasso logistic regression (LASSO), Naive Bayes, gradient-boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), and neural network models were performed for each cohort. The best-performing algorithms were predictive models based on GBM and observation periods â©½1 and â©½3â€‰years after index date. Informative predictors included myocardial imaging, DLBCL stage IV, bronchiolar and renal disease, a chemotherapy regimen, and exposure to diphenhydramine and vasoprotectives on or before the first DLBCL diagnosis. These predictive models may be applied to targeted drug development and have the potential to optimize therapy choices in DLBCL. They were generated efficiently using a large number of independent variables readily available in standard insurance claims or electronic health record data systems.",2019,Cancer Informatics
A Multi-way Multi-task Learning Approach for Multinomial Logistic Regression*. An Application in Joint Prediction of Appointment Miss-opportunities across Multiple Clinics.,"OBJECTIVES
Whether they have been engineered for it or not, most healthcare systems experience a variety of unexpected events such as appointment miss-opportunities that can have significant impact on their revenue, cost and resource utilization. In this paper, a multi-way multi-task learning model based on multinomial logistic regression is proposed to jointly predict the occurrence of different types of miss-opportunities at multiple clinics.


METHODS
An extension of L1â€Š/â€ŠL2 regularization is proposed to enable transfer of information among various types of miss-opportunities as well as different clinics. A proximal algorithm is developed to transform the convex but non-smooth likelihood function of the multi-way multi-task learning model into a convex and smooth optimization problem solvable using gradient descent algorithm.


RESULTS
A dataset of real attendance records of patients at four different clinics of a VA medical center is used to verify the performance of the proposed multi-task learning approach. Additionally, a simulation study, investigating more general data situations is provided to highlight the specific aspects of the proposed approach. Various individual and integrated multinomial logistic regression models with/without LASSO penalty along with a number of other common classification algorithms are fitted and compared against the proposed multi-way multi-task learning approach. Fivefold cross validationÂ is used to estimate comparing models parameters and their predictive accuracy. The multi-way multi-task learning framework enables the proposed approach to achieve aÂ considerable rate of parameter shrinkage and superior prediction accuracy across various types of miss-opportunities and clinics.


CONCLUSIONS
The proposed approach provides an integrated structure to effectively transfer knowledge among different miss-opportunities and clinics to reduce model size, increase estimation efficacy, and more importantly improve predictions results. The proposed framework can be effectively applied to medical centers with multiple clinics, especially those suffering from information scarcity on some type of disruptions and/or clinics.",2017,Methods of information in medicine
Regularizing the Factor Zoo with OWL : A Correlation-Robust Machine Learning Approach âˆ—,"This paper sheds light on a new perspective of the â€œfactor zoo enigmaâ€, in which factor correlation prevails and worsens the â€œcurse of dimensionalityâ€. I introduce a newly developed machine learning tool, OWL, which circumvents complications from correlations in high dimensionality: it can identify and group correlated factors while shrinking off useless/redundant ones. I show that OWL estimator is consistent and I derive the grouping condition for correlated factors. Monte Carlo experiments show that OWL outperforms LASSO, adaptive LASSO and Elastic Net (EN) in various settings, particularly when factors are highly correlated. Empirical evidence suggests that liquidity related factors are primary to drive asset prices but cautions about a time-varying nature in factor selections. Out-of-sample analysis confirms superior performance of OWL hedged portfolios compared with LASSO, EN and Fama-MacBeth regression. JEL classification: C33 C52 C58 G12",2019,

Detection of shielded radionuclides from weak and poorly resolved spectra using group positive RIVAL,"Abstract This paper is concerned with the identification of nuclides from weak and poorly resolved spectra in the presence of unknown radiation shielding materials such as carbon, water, concrete and lead. Since a shield will attenuate lower energies more so than higher ones, isotope sub-spectra must be introduced into models and into detection algorithms. We propose a new algorithm for detection, called group positive RIVAL, that encourages the selection of groups of sub-spectra rather than the selection of individual sub-spectra that may be from the same parent isotope. Indeed, the proposed algorithm incorporates group positive LASSO, and, as such, we supply the consistency results of group positive LASSO and adaptive group positive LASSO. In an example employing various shielding materials and material thicknesses, group positive RIVAL is shown to perform well in all scenarios with the exception of ones in which the shielding material is lead.",2013,Radiation Measurements

A LASSO-based batch process modeling and end-product quality prediction method,"Abstract A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) based batch process modeling and end-product quality prediction method is developed in this paper, which overcomes the shortcomings of both multiway partial least squares (MPLS) and the phase-based methods. The proposed phase-LASSO approach models not only the phase characteristics but also the within-phase and between-phase time-dependent information. In the meantime, it automatically selects the critical-to-quality phases via LASSO-type regularization. As a result, phase-LASSO has good prediction accuracy and model interpretation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by the case study on injection molding.",2014,IFAC Proceedings Volumes
Culturable halophilic bacteria inhabiting Algerian saline ecosystems: A source of promising features and potentialities.,"This paper aims to characterize halophilic bacteria inhabiting Algerian Saline Ecosystems (Sebkha and Chott) located in arid and semi-arid ecoclimate zones (Northeastern Algeria). In addition, screening of enzymatic activities, heavy metal tolerance and antagonistic potential against phytopathogenic fungi were tested. A total of 74 bacterial isolates were screened and phylogenetically characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results showed a heterogeneous group of microorganisms falling within two major phyla, 52 strains belonging to Firmicutes (70.2%) and 22 strains (30.8%) of Î³-Proteobacteria. In terms of main genera present, the isolates were belonging to Bacillus, Halobacillus, Lentibacillus, Oceanobacillus, Paraliobacillus, Planomicrobium, Salicola, Terribacillus, Thalassobacillus, Salibacterium, Salinicoccus, Virgibacillus, Halomonas, Halovibrio, and Idiomarina. Most of the enzymes producers were related to Bacillus, Halobacillus, and Virgibacillus genera and mainly active at 10% of growing salt concentrations. Furthermore, amylase, esterase, gelatinase, and nuclease activities ranked in the first place within the common hydrolytic enzymes. Overall, the isolates showed high minimal inhibitory concentration values (MIC) for Ni2+ and Cu2+ (0.625 to 5Â mM) compared to Cd2+ (0.1 to 2Â mM) and Zn2+ (0.156 to 2Â mM). Moreover, ten isolated strains belonging to Bacillus, Virgibacillus and Halomonas genera, displayed high activity against the pathogenic fungi (Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxyporum, F. verticillioides and Phytophthora capsici). This study on halophilic bacteria of unexplored saline niches provides potential sources of biocatalysts and novel bioactive metabolites as well as promising candidates of biocontrol agents and eco-friendly tools for heavy metal bioremediation.",2019,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology
Evaluation of K-SVD Embedded with Modified â„“ _1 -Norm Sparse Representation Algorithm,"The K-SVD algorithm aims to find an adaptive dictionary for a set of signals by using the sparse representation optimization and constrained singular value decomposition. In this paper, firstly, the original K-SVD algorithm, as well as some sparse representation algorithms including \(\ell _{0}\)-norm OMP and \(\ell _{1}\)-norm Lasso were reviewed. Secondly, the revised Lasso algorithm was embedded into the K-SVD process and a new different K-SVD algorithms with \(\ell _{1}\)-norm Lasso embedded in (RL-K-SVD algrithm) was established. Finally, extensive experiments had been completed on necessary parameters determination, further on the performance compare of recovery error and recognition for the original K-SVD and RL-K-SVD algorithms. The results indicate that within a certain scope of parameter settings, the RL-K-SVD algorithm performs better on image recognition than K-SVD; the time cost for training sample number is lower for RL-K-SVD in case that the sample number is increased to a certain extend.",2017,
Tectonomagmatic evolution of the Earth and Moon,"The Earth and Moon evolved following a similar scenario. The formation of their protocrusts started with upward crystallization of global magmatic oceans. As a result of this process, easily fusible components accumulated in the course of fractional crystallization of melt migrating toward the surface. The protocrusts (granitic in the Earth and anorthositic in the Moon) are retained in ancient continents. The tectonomagmatic activity at the early stage of planet evolution was related to the ascent of mantle plume of the first generation composed of mantle material depleted due to the formation of protocrusts. The regions of extension, rise, and denudation were formed in the Earth above the diffluent heads of such superplumes (Archean granite-greenstone domains and Paleoproterozoic cratons), whereas granulite belts as regions of compression, subsidence, and sedimentation arose above descending mantle flows. The situation may be described in terms of plume tectonics. Gentle uplifts and basins (thalassoids) in lunar continents are probable analogues of these structural elements in the Moon. The period of 2.3â€“2.0 Ga ago was a turning point in the tectonomagmatic evolution of the Earth, when geochemically enriched Fe-Ti picrites and basalts typical of Phanerozoic within-plate magmatism became widespread. The environmental setting on the Earthâ€™s surface changed at that time, as well. Plate tectonics, currently operating on a global scale, started to develop about âˆ¼2 Ga ago. This turn was related to the origination of thermochemical mantle plumes of the second generation at the interface of the liquid Fe-Ni core and silicate mantle. A similar turning point in the lunar evolution probably occurred 4.2â€“3.9 Ga ago and completed with the formation of large depressions (seas) with thinned crust and vigorous basaltic magmatism. Such a sequence of events suggests that qualitatively new material previously retained in the planetsâ€™ cores was involved in tectonomagmatic processes at the middle stage of planetary evolution. This implies that the considered bodies initially were heterogeneous and were then heated from above to the bottom by propagation of a thermal wave accompanied by cooling of outer shells. Going through the depleted mantle, this wave generated thermal superplumes of the first generation. Cores close to the Fe + FeS eutectics in composition were affected by this wave in the last turn. The melting of the cores resulted in the appearance of thermochemical superplumes and corresponding irreversible rearrangement of geotectonic processes.",2010,Geotectonics
Decentralized multi-agent entropy-driven exploration under sparsity constraints,"This paper proposes a new algorithm, which uses the second order information of a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to achieve an active sensing approach driven by minimizing the entropy of sparse unknown environments, for the multi agent case. For this, a signal model, which restricts the agent's measurements according to its sensor's view, is introduced into the Distributed LASSO (DLASSO) framework. With the help of Compressed Sensing (CS), the DLASSO is able to estimate the environment with less measurements. After the DLASSO converged to a solution, each agent evaluates the proposed algorithm for choosing new measurement locations.",2016,"2016 4th International Workshop on Compressed Sensing Theory and its Applications to Radar, Sonar and Remote Sensing (CoSeRa)"

Finally, we discuss the application of these ideas to image approximation using the 2D fused lasso.",2013,"2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing"
Modeling and Prediction of Time Series of Directed Binary Networks,"Over the last few years modeling of temporal evolution of network data has become a relevant problem for different applications. In this work, we develop novel statistical methods for modeling time series of directed binary networks. The main interests are identifying events associated with structural changes over time and perform short-term link prediction of the network in future periods.First, we introduce a Bayesian hidden Markov model that uses a stochastic blockmodel to describe the community structure of the network during each period. This model allow us to monitor structural changes in the network and also perform accurate short-term predictions of future links. As an alternative for link prediction, we propose two multinomial logistic regression models using different lasso type penalties including an extension of the autologistic model for network data. In this setting, we are able to provide fast computational algorithms for estimation and prediction using optimization and full Bayesian inference. The performance of the models is illustrated using both simulated and real data from a financial trading network in the NYMEX natural gas futures market.",2015,
A Moving-window penalization method and its applications,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has played an import role in identifying genetic variants underlying human complex traits. However, its success is hindered by weak effect at causal variants and noise at non-causal variants. Penalized regression can be applied to handle GWAS problems. GWAS data has some specificities. Consecutive genetic markers are usually highly correlated due to linkage disequilibrium. This thesis introduces a moving-window penalized method for GWAS which smooths the effects of consecutive SNPs. Simulation studies indicate that this penalized moving window method provides improved true positive findings. The practical utility of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 Rheumatoid Arthritis data. Next, the moving-window penalty is applied on generalized linear model. We call such an approach as smoothed lasso (SLasso). Coordinate descent computing algorithms are proposed in details, for both quadratic and logistic loss. Asymptotic properties are discussed. Then based on SLasso, we discuss a two-stage method called MW-Ridge. Simulation results show that while SLasso can provide more true positive findings than Lasso, it has a side-effect that it includes more unrelated random noises. MW-Ridge can eliminate such a side-effect and result in high true positive rates and low false detective rates. The applicability to real data is illustrated by using GAW 16 Rheumatoid Arthritis data.",2017,

Idiopathic CD 4 Lymphocytopenia Clinical and Immunologic Characteristics and Follow-Up of 40 Patients,"Idiopathic CD4 T lymphocytopenia (ICL) is a rare and severe condition with limited available data. We conducted a French multicenter study to analyze the clinical and immunologic characteristics of a cohort of patients with ICL according to the Centers for Disease Control criteria. We recruited 40 patients (24 female) of mean age 44.2 T 12.2 (19Y70) years. Patients underwent T-lymphocyte phenotyping and lymphoproliferation assay at diagnosis, and experiments related to thymic function and interferon (IFN)-F release by natural killer (NK) cell were performed. Mean follow-up was 6.9 T 6.7 (0.14Y24.3) years. Infectious, autoimmune, and neoplastic events were recorded, as were outcomes of interleukin 2 therapy. In all, 25 patients had opportunistic infections (12 with human papillomavirus infection), 14 had autoimmune symptoms, 5 had malignancies, and 8 had mild or no symptoms. At the time of diagnosis, the mean cell counts were as follows: mean CD4 cell count: 127/mm (range, 4Y294); mean CD8: 236/mm (range, 1Y1293); mean CD19: 113/mm (range, 3Y547); and mean NK cell count: 122/mm (range, 5Y416). Most patients had deficiency in CD8, CD19, and/or NK cells. Cytotoxic function of NK cells was normal, and patients with infections had a significantly lower NK cell count than those without (p = 0.01). Patients with autoimmune manifestations had increased CD8 T-cell count. Proliferation of thymic precursors, as assessed by T-cell rearrangement excision circles, was increased. Six patients died (15%). CD4 T-cell count G150/mm and NK cell count G100/mm were predictors of death. In conclusion, ICL is a heterogeneous disorder often associated with deficiencies in CD8, CD19, and/or NK cells. Long-term prognosis may be related to initial CD4 and NK cell deficiency.

INTRODUCTION Idiopathic CD4 T lymphocytopenia (ICL) is an immunodeficiency described in 1992 and characterized by the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte count G300/mm or G20% of total T cells on more than 1 cell count at least 6 weeks apart; no evidence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1/2 or human T-cell lymphotropic 1/2 (HTLV-1/2); and lack of a defined immunodeficiency disease or therapy associated with depressed levels of CD4 T cells. Epidemiologic, clinical, and immunologic characteristics of the syndrome were described in 1993, and ICL is now considered a heterogeneous syndrome not caused by an infectious agent. Patients with ICL may have opportunistic infections such as disseminated Cryptococcus neoformans infection, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and John Cunningham (JC) virus infection as a result of profound cell-mediated immune-response deficiency. Few studies have focused on the pathophysiology of ICL.

Moreover, the membrane expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) was found impaired in T lymphocytes with ICL, and CXCR4 trafficking was improved with interleukin 2 (IL-2) treatment in some patients. Recently, mutations in nunc119, MAGT1, and Rag were found associated with CD4 T lymphocytopenia. In a prospective study of 39 patients, CD8 T lymphocytopenia (G180/mm) and degree of CD4 T-cell activation measured by human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) expression were found associated with poor prognosis. We prospectively analyzed the clinical and immunologic characteristics and long-term prognosis of patients with ICL in a French multicenter cohort. We quantified lymphocyte subpopulations and mitogen/antigen-induced proliferation and explored proliferation of thymic precursors through quantification of T-cell rearrangement excision circles (TRECs) as well as natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient Selection We prospectively included patients with CD4 T lymphocytopenia between January 1991 and June 2012. Diagnosis of ICL was based on absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte count G300/mm or G20% of total T cells on 2 cell counts at 6 weeks apart; no HIV-1/2 or HTLV-1/2 infection; and absence of defined immunodeficiency or therapy associated with decreased levels of CD4 T cells. Therefore, we systematically searched for a known primary or secondary immunodeficiency, including viral infection (for example, HIV, HTLV, transient viral infection), tuberculosis, malignancy (lymphoma or solid tumor), autoimmune and/or inflammatory disorders (for example, SjÃ¶gren syndrome, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, granulomatosis with polyangiitis) or other causes of acquired lymphocytopenia. Searches for a known immunodeficiency were performed according to knowledge at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up. Data from clinical files were retrospectively collected by 2 authors (AR and LM). Results for 6 patients were previously reported: Patient 1 (P1), P2, and P13; P12; P14; and P21. Data were analyzed by initial symptoms of any infection known to be associated with lymphocytopenia and any symptom related to autoimmune diseases. During follow-up, unusual infections, neoplasms, and symptoms related to autoimmune diseases were recorded. Patients were classified into 3 groups based on clinical and/or laboratory manifestations at diagnosis or during follow-up: autoimmune/inflammation, infection, or malignancy. Patients could be classified in more than 1 group. TABLE 1.

A boosting approach to structure learning of graphs with and without prior knowledge,"MOTIVATION
Identifying the network structure through which genes and their products interact can help to elucidate normal cell physiology as well as the genetic architecture of pathological phenotypes. Recently, a number of gene network inference tools have appeared based on Gaussian graphical model representations. Following this, we introduce a novel Boosting approach to learn the structure of a high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model motivated by the applications in genomics. A particular emphasis is paid to the inclusion of partial prior knowledge on the structure of the graph. With the increasing availability of pathway information and large-scale gene expression datasets, we believe that conditioning on prior knowledge will be an important aspect in raising the statistical power of structural learning algorithms to infer true conditional dependencies.


RESULTS
Our Boosting approach, termed BoostiGraph, is conceptually and algorithmically simple. It complements recent work on the network inference problem based on Lasso-type approaches. BoostiGraph is computationally cheap and is applicable to very high-dimensional graphs. For example, on graphs of order 5000 nodes, it is able to map out paths for the conditional independence structure in few minutes. Using computer simulations, we investigate the ability of our method with and without prior information to infer Gaussian graphical models from artificial as well as actual microarray datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that, using our method, it is possible to recover the true network topology with relatively high accuracy.

Essai de revue des concentrations mÃ©tallifÃ¨res dans le cycle sÃ©dimentaire,"ZusammenfassungDer Autor gibt zunÃ¤chst eine Zusammenfassung der Debatten fÃ¼r und gegen die syngenetische oder epigenetische Deutung von ErzlagerstÃ¤tten. Betont wird die Bedeutung, die den Argumenten fÃ¼r die Gleichzeitigkeit von Metallanreicherungen und ihren Begleitgesteinen zukommt. Wichtig ist auch der Nachweis, daÃŸ synsedimentÃ¤re Umlagerungen der Mineralisierungen vorkommen.Auf diese Weise kommen wir dazu, die Metallogenese syngenetischer, sedimentÃ¤rer Erzanreicherungen unter dem doppelten Aspekt der Metallzufuhr und des sedimentÃ¤ren Milieus eines â€žWirtsgesteinesâ€œ zu untersuchen. Die AbbaufÃ¤higkeit, d. h. die wirtschaftlichen Grenzgehalte eines gegebenen vererzten Gesteinsvolumens, hÃ¤ngt in der heutigen Situation davon ab, daÃŸ nur ein auÃŸergewÃ¶hnliches Zusammentreffen von einer betrÃ¤chtlichen Metallzufuhr und einer gÃ¼nstigen sedimentÃ¤ren Fazies zu wirtschaftlich interessanten LagerstÃ¤tten fÃ¼hren.ZunÃ¤chst werden die verschiedenen, theoretisch mÃ¶glichen Arten von Metallzufuhr, die zeitgleich zur Sedimentation sind, behandelt (terrigen, exhalativ, thalassogen und â€” nicht zu vergessen â€” auch Zufuhr durch fluide Substanzen). AnschlieÃŸend behandelt der Autor die geochemischen und geologischen Eigenschaften der verschiedenen sedimentÃ¤ren Umgebungen in sandiger, toniger und karbonatischer Fazies. Damit lassen sich die verschiedenen Typen der LagerstÃ¤tten und die Art ihrer Vererzung ableiten.Die Suche nach den GesetzmÃ¤ÃŸigkeiten der Entstehung metallischer Konzentrationen innerhalb des sedimentÃ¤ren Zyklus fÃ¼hrt zur Herausarbeitung der VorgÃ¤nge der Zufuhr und der Speicherung der Metalle. FÃ¼r die Speicherung sind vor allem Dauer und die Regelung Parameter, die die Wirksamkeit der KonzentrierungsvorgÃ¤nge beeinflussen. Sie wird man innerhalb der lithologischen Gegebenheiten durch taktische Prospektion zu ermitteln haben. Im Rahmen der jeweiligen metallogenetischen Provinz sind es vor allem die optimalen Charakteristika der verschiedenen Typen der Metallzufuhr, die es zu ermitteln gilt. Sie ergeben sich aus geologischen und geochemischen Informationen, die durch strategische Prospektion zu ermitteln sind. Daraus ergeben sich die einfachen Prinzipien der indirekten Prospektionsmethode auf erzfÃ¼hrende Konzentrationsbereiche innerhalb des sedimentÃ¤ren Zyklus.AbstractThe author summarizes the main arguments in the debate between syngenetic and epigenetic deposits and then underlines the importance of the arguments which prove that the formation of the sediments and of the metalliferous concentrations which they bear are contemporaneous. This is strongly suggested by very early syn-sedimentary reworking of the mineralization.This approach leads to a consideration of metallogenesis of syngenetic sedimentary concentrations both as a supply of metal and a sedimentary trap. The exploitability of mineralized rocks is presently such that only the coincidence of an outstanding supply of metal and a receptive sedimentary environment will yield a workable ore deposit.Reviewing all metalliferous sources which could be contemporaneous with sedimentation (terrigenous, exhalative, marine and possibly also fluidogenic) the author stresses the geological and geochemical characteristic of the surrounding sediments. At the same time, the examination of traps in sandy, shaly and carbonate environments permits to the identification of the main characteristics of the concentration on the scale of the deposit and of the ore itself.The search for an understanding of metalliferous concentrations in the sedimentary cycle becomes a question of defining criteria for the quality of supplies and traps. On the level of the trap these would be the duration and the regulation of parameters which govern the efficiency of the concentrating system: the sedimentary features which result from these concentrating processes must be recognized within the lithologic column during tactical exploration. On the level of the metallogenetic province it is the purpose of strategic exploration to search among the available geological and geochemical data for features which favor each type of supply. These are the basic principles of the indirect method of exploration for sedimentary ore deposits.RÃ©sumÃ©AprÃ¨s avoir rappelÃ© les terms du dÃ©bat contradictoire sur la syngenÃ¨se et l'Ã©pigenÃ¨se, l'auteur souligne la valeur des arguments prouvant la contemporanitÃ© de la formation des concentrations mÃ©tallifÃ¨res et de leur roche-support et, notamment, l'existence de remaniements syn-sÃ©dimentaires trÃ¨s prÃ©coces des minÃ©ralisations.Cette maniÃ¨re de faire conduit Ã  envisager la mÃ©tallogÃ©nie des concentrations sÃ©dimentaires syngÃ©nÃ©tiques sous le double aspect d'un Â«apport mÃ©tallifÃ¨reÂ» et d'un Â«milieu sÃ©dimentaire piÃ¨geÂ». L'exploitabilitÃ© des volumes minÃ©ralisÃ©s est actuellement telle (teneurs-limites) que seule la conjonction d'un apport exceptionnel dans un milieu sÃ©dimentaire rÃ©ceptif peut conduire Ã  des gisements Ã©conomiquement intÃ©ressants.Passant en revue les diffÃ©rents apports mÃ©tallifÃ¨res contemporains de la sÃ©dimentation possibles (terrigÃ¨ne, exhalatif, thalassogÃ¨ne et, pour mÃ©moire, fluidogÃ¨ne), l'auteur Ã©voque les particularitÃ©s gÃ©ologiques et gÃ©ochimiques des environnements correspondants. ParallÃ¨lement, l'examen des milieux piÃ¨ges en environnement grÃ©seux, argileux, et carbonatÃ© permet de situer les caractÃ¨res des types au niveau des gisements euxmÃŠmes et de leurs minerais.Rechercher la logique des concentrations mÃ©tallifÃ¨res dans le cycle sÃ©dimentaire revient alors Ã  dÃ©finir les critÃ¨res de qualitÃ© des apports et des piÃ¨ges. Au niveau du piÃ¨ge, ce sont la durÃ©e et la rÃ©gulation des paramÃ¨tres qui assurent l'efficacitÃ© du systÃ¨me concentrateur qu'il conviendra de repÃ©rer en prospection tactique, dans la colonne lithologique. Au niveau de la province mÃ©tallogÃ©nique, ce sont les caractÃ¨res favorables Ã  chaque type d'apport qu'il faut rechercher dans l'information gÃ©ologique et gÃ©ochimique, en prospection stratÃ©gique. Tels apparaissent les principes simples de la mÃ©thode indirecte de prospection des concentrations mÃ©tallifÃ¨res dans le cycle sÃ©dimentaire.ÐºÐ ÐÑ‚ÐºÐžÐ• ÑÐžÐ”Ð•Ð Ð¶ÐÐÐ˜Ð•ÐÐ’Ñ‚ÐžÐ ÐžÐœ Ð”ÐÐ•Ñ‚ÑÑŒ ÐºÐ ÐÑ‚Ðº Ð˜Ð˜ ÐžÐ‘Ð¶ÐžÐ  Ñ‚Ð•ÐžÐ Ð˜Ð˜ Ðž Ð¿Ð ÐžÐ˜ ÑÑ…ÐžÐ¶Ð”Ð•ÐÐ˜Ð˜, ÐºÐÐº ÑÐ˜ÐÐ³Ð•ÐÐ•Ñ‚Ð˜Ð§Ð•ÑÐºÐ˜Ñ…, Ñ‚ÐÐº Ð˜ ÐÐ¿Ð˜Ð³Ð•ÐÐ•Ñ‚Ð˜Ð§Ð•ÑÐºÐ˜ Ñ… Ð Ð£Ð”ÐÑ‹Ñ… ÐœÐ•ÑÑ‚ÐžÐ ÐžÐ¶Ð”Ð•Ð Ð˜Ð˜.

Sexuelle Selektion: evolutionÃ¤re Grundlagen,"Im Tierreich existieren neben der uns vertrauten, getrenntgeschlechtlichen sexuellen Fortpflanzung eine Reihe anderer Fortpflanzungssysteme. Diese unterschiedlichen Formen der Fortpflanzung konnen als Life history-Merkmale verstanden werden, die das Fortpflanzungsverhalten von Individuen der jeweiligen Taxa in gewisser Weise festlegen und damit teilweise erklaren. So unterscheiden sich die Fortpflanzungsstrategien von protogynen hermaphroditischen Blaukopflippfischen (Thalassoma bifasciatum) von denen gynogyner Amazonenkarpflinge (Poecilia formosa), haplodiploider Honigbienen (Apis mellifera) oder getrenntgeschlechtlicher Kohlmeisen (Parus major) in vielerlei Weise allein aufgrund ihres jeweiligen Fortpflanzungssystems. Fur all diese Organismen liefert die Theorie der sexuellen Selektion ein Gerust zur Analyse der Verhaltensweisen und anderer Anpassungen in Zusammenhang mit der Fortpflanzung, so dass ich deren Grundlagen als erstes vorstellen mochte. Ich werde dabei sexuelle Selektion naher charakterisieren, die Beziehungen zwischen Life history und Fortpflanzung sowie die biologischen Grundlagen und Determinanten von Geschlechterrollen besprechen. Da die Dynamik der sexuellen Selektion auch wesentlich vom Geschlechterverhaltnis beeinflusst wird, schliest dieses Kapitel mit einer Diskussion der Sex-ratio-Theorie.",2012,
"Exploiting Correlation in Sparse Signal Recovery Problems: Multiple Measurement Vectors, Block Sparsity, and Time-Varying Sparsity","A trend in compressed sensing (CS) is to exploit structure for improved reconstruction performance. In the basic CS model, exploiting the clustering structure among nonzero elements in the solution vector has drawn much attention, and many algorithms have been proposed. However, few algorithms explicitly consider correlation within a cluster. Meanwhile, in the multiple measurement vector (MMV) model correlation among multiple solution vectors is largely ignored. Although several recently developed algorithms consider the exploitation of the correlation, these algorithms need to know a priori the correlation structure, thus limiting their effectiveness in practical problems. 
Recently, we developed a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm, namely T-SBL, and its variants, which adaptively learn the correlation structure and exploit such correlation information to significantly improve reconstruction performance. Here we establish their connections to other popular algorithms, such as the group Lasso, iterative reweighted $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ algorithms, and algorithms for time-varying sparsity. We also provide strategies to improve these existing algorithms.",2011,ArXiv
Penalized regression techniques for prediction: a case study for predicting tree mortality using remotely sensed vegetation indices,"Constructing models can be complicated when the available fitting data are highly correlated and of high dimension. However, the complications depend on whether the goal is prediction instead of estimation. We focus on predicting tree mortality (measured as the number of dead trees) from change metrics derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite images. The high dimensionality and multicollinearity inherent in such data are of particular concern. Standard regression techniques perform poorly for such data, so we examine shrinkage regression techniques such as ridge regression, the LASSO, and partial least squares, which yield more robust predictions. We also suggest efficient strategies that can be used to select optimal models such as 0.632+ bootstrap and generalized cross validation. The techniques are compared using simulations. The techniques are then used to predict insect-induced tree mortality severity for a Pinus radiata D. Don plantation in southern New South Wales, Austr...",2011,Canadian Journal of Forest Research
Development of Regression Model Using Lasso And Optimisation of Process Parameters in Metal Spinning,"Metal Spinning is a concept of describing the forming of metal into seamless, axisymmetric shapes by a combination of rotational motion and force. Sheet metal spinning is one of the metal forming processes, which a flat metal blank is rotated at a high speed and formed into an axisymmetric part by a roller which gradually forces the blank on to a mandrel, bearing the final shape of the spun part. Over the last few decades, sheet metal spinning has developed significantly and spun products have been used in various industries. Nowadays the process has been expanded to new horizons in industries, since tendency to use minimum tool and equipment costs and also using lower forces with the output of excellent surface quality and good mechanical properties. The automation of the process is of greater importance, due to its wider applications like decorative householdâ€Ÿs goods, rocket nose cones, gas cylinders etc. The objective of the current work is to develop the mathematical model for the spinning process with surface roughness as response and the input parameters as Mandrel speed (rpm), geometry of the Roller and Thickness of sheet (mm). Type of mandrel (EN8 Material) considered in the spinning process has the geometrical profile of parabola and single roller and double roller tools (EN8 Material) are used to deform the Al2024-T3 sheet metal paper aims to understand the process parameters that affect the surface finish of the spun component. Full factorial Design of Experiments technique is used to find the minimum number of experimental trials that are required to develop the regression model. A regression model using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) is developed to further deepen the understanding between the input parameters and the surface roughness. The model was optimised using Sequential Quadratic Programming.",2017,

Catching Growth Determinants with the Adaptive Lasso,"Abstract This paper uses the adaptive Lasso estimator to determine variables important for economic growth. The adaptive Lasso estimator is a computationally very efficient procedure that simultaneously performs model selection and parameter estimation. The computational cost of this method is negligibly small compared with standard approaches in the growth regressions literature. We apply this method for a regional dataset for the European Union covering the 255 NUTS2 regions in the 27 member states over the period 1995-2005. The results suggest that initial GDP per capita (with an implied convergence speed of about 1.5% per annum), human capital ( proxied by the shares of highly and medium educated in the working age population), structural labor market characteristics (the initial unemployment rate and the initial activity rate of the low educated) as well as being a capital region are important for economic growth.",2008,German Economic Review

This class of problems has many applications in variable selections such as the group LASSO and sparse group LASSO. In this paper, we propose a proximal Landweber Newton method for this class of convex optimization problems, and carry out the convergence and computational complexity analysis for this method. Theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is promising.",2015,Computational Optimization and Applications
Designing Innovative Campuses for Tomorrow's Students,"THE EFFORTTO REMAKE higher education institutions into entrepreneurship and innovation hubs has escalated like a Cold War arms race. The promised payoffs of this innovation drive are institution-wide and community-deep: building relationships, aligning the institution, and preparing the organization as well as its students for transformational change. But how do you create space that can be messy and nonlinear in an institutional culture that is steeped in tradition, standards, and rules? It may be that pursuing effective university-driven innovation programs and facilities will involve equally innovative strategic approaches to design and development--for example, decoupling innovation centers from any single departmental steward and, perhaps, from institutional ownership overall. Planning for places that foster effective innovation is still an emerging process, but the constant pressure on universities to do so continues from two of their key institutional constituencies--students and employers. Generations Y and Z--and the expectations of their parents-are primarily sparking the innovation drive on campus. A 2014 study by the research firm Millennial Branding (Schawbel 2014) revealed that high school students at the time were more entrepreneurial than college students: 72 percent of high school students and 64 percent of college students studied said they wanted to start a business someday. Further, 61 percent of high school students and 43 percent of college students would rather be entrepreneurs than employees when they graduate college. As the most digitally connected group in history, Generation Z students are preconditioned to massive disruption and uncertainty. Concerned that traditional career approaches cannot be trusted, they are highly motivated to build innovation skills and exercise their entrepreneurial interests--perhaps even more than their Generation Y predecessors. The second group driving the growth of university innovation centers is the marketplace of corporate employers who recruit on campus. They require a workforce of more agile thinkers who can apply an owner's mind-set and work ethic to ever-shifting market needs. More than ever, employers are evaluating job candidates on more than just grades--they want students who demonstrate leadership, critical thinking, and communication skills. They expect universities to sharpen the innovative instincts of incoming students-readying them for the realities of corporate hyper-change. Colleges and universities are the natural connecting point for these trends. In the competition to demonstrate innovation mastery, university faculty and pedagogy need supporting infrastructure and technology. Campus design and architecture will be the prime catalysts for transforming universities into our society's engines of growth. Here are a few examples of new innovation centers and entrepreneurship facilities built on campuses recently: * Spring 2015: The University of South Carolina broke ground on a new Innovation Center building to house its Center for Applied Innovation. * Summer 2015: Vanderbilt University announced the development of a new Innovation Center to encourage a ""maker"" culture to spark entrepreneurship and creativity on campus. * Fall 2015: The U.S. Economic Development Administration awarded the University of Florida $8 million toward the Phase II construction of its Florida Innovation Hub. * Winter 2016: The Watt Family Innovation Center at Clemson University--a $30.5 million facility-announced that Philips Lighting North America and SCRA Applied Technologies had signed on as founding innovation partners. * Spring 2016: IBM and the University of South Carolina launched the Center for Applied Innovation, a five-story $25 million building. * Fall 2016: University of Utah will launch Lassonde Studios as a living and creating facility for entrepreneurs that includes 400 student residences and a 20,000-square-foot, 24/7 ""garage"" for student innovators. â€¦",2016,Planning for higher education
Stories on the positive and negative effects of globalization on workers in developing countries abound. But a comprehensive picture is missing and many of the stories,"Stories on the positive and negative effects of globalization on workers in developing countries abound. But a comprehensive picture is missing and many of the stories are ideologically charged. This paper reviews the academic literature on the subject, including several studies currently under way, and derives the implications for public policy. First, it deals with the effects of openness to trade, foreign direct investment and financial crises on average wages. Second, it discusses the impact of exposure to world markets on the dispersion of wages by occupation, skill and gender. Third, it describes the pattern of job destruction and job creation associated with globalization. Because these two processes are not synchronized, the fourth issue addressed is the impact on unemployment rates. Fifth, the paper reviews the labor market policies that can be used to offset the adverse impacts of globalization on employment and labor earnings. Finally, it discusses how the international community could encourage developing countries to adopt sound labor market policies in the context of globalization. The author is grateful to Gordon Betcherman, Richard Freeman, Emanuela Galasso, Peter Lanjouw, Dorsati Madani, Remco Oostendorp and Tzafiris Tzannatos for inputs and comments, and to Manuel Felix for excellent research assistance.

Subset selection processes to identify significant input variables for nonlinear target functions,"Abstract Data mining, machine learning and neural networks represent promising methods for identifying signifi cant input patterns for both linear and nonlinear relationships from metadata. This paper utilizes randomly generated nonlinear functions in multiple dimensions, with input vectors selected from a superset. Subset selection processes with expanded basis functions are tested for predictability to identify these target functions. Both ridge and Lasso regularization have no diff iculty separating a nonlinear function from added normal noise. The Lasso delivers a simpler model that regresses well for almost linear target functions, and for highly nonlinear functions, if the nonlinear relationship is identified a priori in the basis set. Results imply a methodology for identifying signifi cant biomarkers from longitudinal studies for frailty syndrome, and other complex diseases over time.",2011,Journal of Interdisciplinary Mathematics
Shrinkage and penalized estimators in weighted least absolute deviations regression models,"ABSTRACT In this paper, we consider the estimation problem of the weighted least absolute deviation (WLAD) regression parameter vector when there are some outliers or heavy-tailed errors in the response and the leverage points in the predictors. We propose the pretest and Jamesâ€“Stein shrinkage WLAD estimators when some of the parameters may be subject to certain restrictions. We derive the asymptotic risk of the pretest and shrinkage WLAD estimators and show that if the shrinkage dimension exceeds two, the asymptotic risk of the shrinkage WLAD estimator is strictly less than the unrestricted WLAD estimator. On the other hand, the risk of the pretest WLAD estimator depends on the validity of the restrictions on the parameters. Furthermore, we study the WLAD absolute shrinkage and selection operator (WLAD-LASSO) and compare its relative performance with the pretest and shrinkage WLAD estimators. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators relative to that of the unrestricted WLAD estimator. A real-life data example using body fat study is used to illustrate the performance of the suggested estimators.",2018,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
Influencing Recruitment Inferred from Distributions of Coral Reef Fishes,"To determine the relative impact of oceanographic vs. benthic processes on recruitment of coral reef fi shes to back reef lagoon nursery habitats, we examined the distributions of small fi shes (recruits < 3 cm), medium (juvenile 3â€“5 cm), and large (juvenile/ adults > 5 cm) of fi ve fi sh taxa at six, 16-ha lagoons of St. Croix, USVI. Since all habitats of a location are infl uenced by the same oceanographic events, it was hypothesized that rankings of recruit densities on the same habitat types across different lagoons should be similar if oceanographic processes have a dominant infl uence on recruitment. Concordance analysis of recruit densities produced no evidence of consistent amongsite differences. It was hypothesized that consistent rankings of habitats within lagoons (e.g., density of post-settlers on rubble habitat ranked higher than seagrass habitat within all lagoons), indicated post-settlement benthic processes were more infl uential. Differential use of habitat by recruits was consistent among lagoons and over 2 yrs of study. Patterns of habitat use by juveniles were different from the patterns of recruits. Acanthurus spp. and Haemulon spp. moved from the lagoon (nursery habitats) to the reef (adult habitat), and densities of large fi shes of these species on back reefs were strongly related to the availability of nursery habitat in adjacent lagoons. These ontogenetic changes in habitat use indicate continuing infl uence of benthic processes. This publication is part in a series of papers resulting from a scientifi c workshop held at the Caribbean Marine Research Center (December 2001) to evaluate the importance of back reef systems for supporting biodiversity and productivity of marine ecosystems. The life history of most coral reef fi shes is a two-phase cycle that decouples local reproduction from recruitment of new individuals into the local population. Juveniles and adults are demersal while larvae are planktonic. Furthermore, larvae of many prominent fi sh taxa on coral reefs settle into habitats that are distinct from those of adults (Robertson et al., 1979; Shulman and Ogden, 1987), creating another stage within the demersal phase of life history. Thus, for many coral reef fi shes, the life history includes three stages; larval (planktonic), juvenile (demersal), and adult (demersal) â€“ further complicating population dynamics. Oceanographic processes may determine settlement patterns of coral reef fi shes by transporting and infl uencing the survival of larvae (Choat et al., 1988). For example, for some species in Barbados, the occurrence of late stage larvae in traps corresponded with the fi rst appearance of juveniles on reefs, suggesting that larval supply was a good indicator of settlement (Sponaugle and Cowen, 1996). Moreover, larvae of some species [e.g., Stegastes partitus (Poey, 1868) and Acanthurus bahianus (Castelnau, 1855)] were consistently associated spatially and temporally, suggesting these species were infl uenced similarly by oceanographic processes such as prevailing currents, tidal currents, wind-induced water fl ow, and large-scale externally forced events. However, mixed results from recent studies of recruitment at multiple spatial scales demonstrate the complexity of processes infl uencing larval supply, settlement, and postsettlement densities. Signifi cant spatial trends in settlement for Thalassoma bifasciatum (Bloch, 1791) were attributed to oceanographic infl uences by Caselle and Warner (1996). BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL. 75, NO. 2, 2004 154 However, these spatial trends were much weaker for all species combined, and others have reported consistent spatial trends for some species, but not others (Fowler et al., 1992; Green, 1998; Tolimieri et al., 1998; Vigliola et al., 1998). Furthermore, Caselle and Warner (1996) concluded that although patterns of settler densities were determined by oceanographic processes, spatial variation in recruitment resulted from a combination of larval supply, settlement habitat patterns, and post-settlement movement and mortality. In general, recruitment (entry into the benthic population after the high mortality of the early post-settlement period; Booth and Brosnan, 1995) is probably affected by varying combinations of larval supply and benthic processes (Choat et al., 1988; Fowler et al., 1992; Booth and Beretta, 1994; Gibson, 1994; Booth and Brosnan, 1995; Tolimieri, 1998a; Tolimieri et al., 1998), with the relative importance of oceanographic vs. benthic processes varying among species and locations. Our knowledge of the juvenile stage of the life cycle and the transition from juvenile nursery habitat to adult habitat is even less developed than our knowledge of settlement, and our grasp of population dynamics of coral reef fi shes is hampered by this ignorance (Jones, 1991). For example, during a post-settlement transition period, larvae may actively search out particular habitats (Sancho et al., 1997), or enter and exit habitats multiple times before permanently entering the benthic population (Kaufman et al., 1992), but the reasons for these movements are unclear. That settling fi shes search for suitable habitat indicates that fi nding a good nursery habitat is worth the energy and predation risk associated with exploratory movement. However, even though we know that recruitment patterns are modifi ed after settlement (Eggleston, 1995; Caselle and Warner, 1996; Tolimieri, 1998b), and we know the habitat requirements of recruits and adults of many coral reef fi shes (Sale et al., 1984; Robertson, 1988; Tolimieri, 1998a,b), we do not understand which processes are most important in determining spatial patterns of abundance. Furthermore, much of the research into the importance of recruitment to the abundance of adult fi shes has been conducted on species that spend the entire demersal portion of the life cycle in a single habitat (e.g., Green, 1996), or even a single site (e.g., Doherty, 1983), and these fi ndings may not be applicable to coral reef fi shes in general. In this study, we focus on species that are not site-attached, and undergo ontogenetic habitat shifts, such that they are more likely to be infl uenced by benthic processes (Ault and Johnson, 1998). Determining the relative importance of oceanographic and benthic processes to coral reef fi shes is not only important for understanding the ecology of coral reefs, but also has management implications. The design of marine reserves, for example, must consider not only the source and destination of larvae, but the extent, quality, and dispersion of habitats. This is especially true for species that undergo ontogenetic shifts that incorporate multiple habitats during their benthic life stages. By examining the utilization patterns of back reef and lagoon habitats by the early life stages of coral reef fi shes, we can begin to determine the extent to which abundances of these species on coral reefs are a function of surrounding shallow-water nursery habitats (Parrish, 1989), and incorporate this information into the design of marine reserves. We used spatial distributions of post-settlement, juvenile, and sub-adult and adult fi shes to test three hypotheses concerning the relative importance of oceanographic and benthic processes on populations of coral reef fi shes that utilize lagoon habitats as nurseries: (H1) Recruitment is almost completely determined by oceanographic processes; (H2) Recruitment is primarily determined by benthic processes; and (H3) Adult populations on adjacent reefs are infl uenced by the habitat composition of nearby lagoons. ADAMS AND EBERSOLE: PROCESSES INFLUENCING FISH RECRUITMENT 155 We reasoned that in an extreme case where oceanographic processes completely determined recruitment by creating differences in recruit densities among lagoons/back reefs (scale of kilometers), then recruitment to all habitats within a lagoon (scale of hundreds of meters) should be infl uenced in the same manner. Thus, if oceanographic processes are the overwhelmingly dominant infl uence on recruitment (H1), a study lagoon with high recruitment in one habitat should have high recruitment in all habitats. By contrast, benthic infl uences would be based on local factors (scale of meters), such as predation intensity and availability of food and shelter, so that the pattern of variation in habitat quality among lagoons would be different for each habitat type. Thus, if benthic processes are dominant (H2), high recruitment in one habitat of a given lagoon will not be associated with high recruitment in other habitats of the lagoon. Instead, patterns of habitat use by post-settlement and juvenile fi shes should be similar for all lagoons, irrespective of habitat availability. It then follows that reefs adjacent to lagoons with more of the most heavily used habitats should have more adults. This leads to the hypothesis that if quality of lagoon habitats is infl uential in determining densities of post-settlement and juvenile fi shes for species that use lagoon habitats as nurseries, then lagoons with the greatest amount of highly used nursery habitat would have the greatest densities of sub-adults and adults on adjacent back reefs (H3).",2004,

Radiomics analysis of multiparametric MRI for prediction of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer,"ObjectivesTo develop and validate a radiomics predictive model based on pre-treatment multiparameter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and clinical features to predict a pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) after receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT).MethodsOne hundred and eighty-six consecutive patients with LARC (training dataset, n = 131; validation dataset, n = 55) were enrolled in our retrospective study. A total of 1,188 imaging features were extracted from pre-CRT T2-weighted (T2-w), contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (cT1-w) and ADC images for each patient. Three steps including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were performed to select key features and build a radiomics signature. Combining clinical risk factors, a radiomics nomogram was constructed. The predictive performance was evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and then assessed with respect to its calibration, discrimination and clinical usefulness.ResultsThirty-one of 186 patients (16.7%) achieved pCR. The radiomics signature derived from joint T2-w, ADC, and cT1-w images, comprising 12 selected features, was significantly associated with pCR status and showed better predictive performance than signatures derived from either of them alone in both datasets. The radiomics nomogram, incorporating the radiomics signature and MR-reported T-stages, also showed good discrimination, with areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) of 0.948 (95% CI, 0.907-0.989) and 0.966 (95% CI, 0.924-1.000), as well as good calibration in both datasets. Decision curve analysis confirmed its clinical usefulness.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that the pre-treatment radiomics nomogram can predict pCR in patients with LARC and potentially guide treatments to select patients for a â€œwait-and-seeâ€ policy.Key Pointsâ€¢ Radiomics analysis of pre-CRT multiparameter MR images could predict pCR in patients with LARC.â€¢ Proposed radiomics signature from joint T2-w, ADC and cT1-w images showed better predictive performance than individual signatures.â€¢ Most of the clinical characteristics were unable to predict pCR.",2018,European Radiology

The average radial velocity Vr 130km=s suggests that UUHerbelongstotheoldpopulationoftheGalaxy.Nosystem- atic dependence of the velocity on depth of the line formation layer or on ionization and excitation potential is observed. The radial velocity of the H absorption differs strongly from the average photospheric velocity. The iron abundance in the photosphere of UUHer is signicantly lower than that of the Sun: (Fe=H) = 1:32. The enhancement of nitrogen relatively to iron content (N=Fe) =0 :40 in combination with the carbon underabun- dance (C=Fe) = 0:30 suggests that only a rst dredge-up episode occurred. The Na content is normal relatively to iron, therefore there is no evidence for dredging-up of Ne-Na cycle products.Theheavys-processmetalsY,Baaredepletedrelative to H and Fe, which again implies that the third dredge-up did not occur.

"Prognostic value of blood-biomarkers related to hypoxia, inflammation, immune response and tumour load in non-small cell lung cancer - A survival model with external validation.","AIM
Improve the prognostic prediction of clinical variables for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), by selecting from blood-biomarkers, non-invasively describing hypoxia, inflammation and tumour load.


METHODS
Model development and validation included 182 and 181 inoperable stage I-IIIB NSCLC patients treated radically with radiotherapy (55.2%) or chemo-radiotherapy (44.8%). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), selected from blood-biomarkers related to hypoxia [osteopontin (OPN) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX)], inflammation [interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and C-reactive protein (CRP)], and tumour load [carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and cytokeratin fragment 21-1 (Cyfra 21-1)]. Sequent model extension selected from alpha-2-macroglobulin (Î±2M), serum interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2r), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Discrimination was reported by concordance-index.


RESULTS
OPN and Cyfra 21-1 (hazard ratios of 3.3 and 1.7) significantly improved a clinical model comprising gender, World Health Organization performance-status, forced expiratory volume in 1s, number of positive lymph node stations, and gross tumour volume, from a concordance-index of 0.66 to 0.70 (validation=0.62 and 0.66). Extension of the validated model yielded a concordance-index of 0.67, including Î±2M, sIL2r and VEGF (hazard ratios of 4.6, 3.1, and 1.4).


CONCLUSION
Improvement of a clinical model including hypoxia and tumour load blood-biomarkers was validated. New immunological markers were associated with overall survival.

Phrasing techniques for multi-stroke selection gestures,"Pen gesture interfaces have difficulty supporting arbitrary multiple-stroke selections because lifting the pen introduces ambiguity as to whether the next stroke should add to the existing selection, or begin a new one. We explore and evaluate techniques that use a non-preferred-hand button or touchpad to phrase together one or more independent pen strokes into a unitary multi-stroke gesture. We then illustrate how such phrasing techniques can support multiple-stroke selection gestures with tapping, crossing, lassoing, disjoint selection, circles of exclusion, selection decorations, and implicit grouping operations. These capabilities extend the expressiveness of pen gesture interfaces and suggest new directions for multiple-stroke pen input techniques.",2006,
Network structure of the Wisconsin Schizotypy Scalesâ€“Short Forms: Examining psychometric network filtering approaches,"Schizotypy is a multidimensional construct that provides a useful framework for understanding the etiology, development, and risk for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Past research has applied traditional methods, such as factor analysis, to uncovering common dimensions of schizotypy. In the present study, we aimed to advance the construct of schizotypy, measured by the Wisconsin Schizotypy Scalesâ€“Short Forms (WSS-SF), beyond this general scope by applying two different psychometric network filtering approachesâ€”the state-of-the-art approach (lasso), which has been employed in previous studies, and an alternative approach (information-filtering networks; IFNs). First, we applied both filtering approaches to two large, independent samples of WSS-SF data (ns = 5,831 and 2,171) and assessed each approachâ€™s representation of the WSS-SFâ€™s schizotypy construct. Both filtering approaches produced results similar to those from traditional methods, with the IFN approach producing results more consistent with previous theoretical interpretations of schizotypy. Then we evaluated how well both filtering approaches reproduced the global and local network characteristics of the two samples. We found that the IFN approach produced more consistent results for both global and local network characteristics. Finally, we sought to evaluate the predictability of the network centrality measures for each filtering approach, by determining the core, intermediate, and peripheral items on the WSS-SF and using them to predict interview reports of schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms. We found some similarities and differences in their effectiveness, with the IFN approachâ€™s network structure providing better overall predictive distinctions. We discuss the implications of our findings for schizotypy and for psychometric network analysis more generally.",2018,Behavior Research Methods
Involving Men in Maternity Care in Burkina Faso: An Intervention Study,"Background: 
The Sustainable Development Goals draw attention to the need for further improvements in 
reproductive health in low-resource settings. In Burkina Faso, the uptake of postpartum 
contraception, postnatal care attendance and the practice of exclusive breastfeeding are low. 
Men take many decisions that affect women and newbornsâ€™ health, despite having little 
exposure to health information. We hypothesised that a strategy to involve men in facility-based 
maternity care, in an urban area with high antenatal care attendance, would improve adherence 
to recommended healthy practices after birth. 
Methods: 
This was a mixed-methods study. Focus group discussions and consultations informed the 
development of an intervention with three components: A) a group discussion with male 
partners of pregnant women, B) a couple counselling session during pregnancy, and C) partner 
participation in the pre-discharge postpartum consultation. This was tested through a 
randomised controlled trial. 1144 pregnant women were enrolled in 5 primary health centres in 
Bobo-Dioulasso, and randomised 1:1 to intervention or control (routine care only). Participants 
were followed up at 3 and 8 months postpartum. For process evaluation, 40 semi-structured 
interviews were conducted with women, men and health workers. 
Results: 
Three quarters of male partners in the intervention arm attended at least 2 of 3 components. The 
intervention increased attendance at outpatient postnatal care (at least 2 consultations), exclusive 
breastfeeding at 3 months postpartum, effective modern contraception use at 8 months 
postpartum, especially long-acting methods, and improved an unvalidated measure of 
relationship adjustment. Several factors influencing adherence to the intervention emerged from 
the qualitative process data. The intervention appears to have worked mainly by increasing male 
knowledge on key topics and promoting couple communication and shared decision-making. 
Providers reported specific implementation challenges. 
Conclusion: 
Gender-transformative interventions to involve men as supportive partners in maternity care can 
improve adherence to recommended healthy practices among postpartum women.",2017,
Identification of a robust non-coding RNA signature in diagnosing autism spectrum disorder by cross-validation of microarray data from peripheral blood samples.,"Novel molecular signatures are needed to improve the early and accurate diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and indicate physicians to provide timely intervention. This study aimed to identify a robust blood non-coding RNA (ncRNA) signature in diagnosing ASD. One hundred eighty six blood samples in the microarray dataset were randomly divided into the training set (nâ€Š=â€Š112) and validation set (nâ€Š=â€Š72). Then, the microarray probe expression profile was re-annotated into the expression profile of 4143 ncRNAs though probe sequence mapping. In the training set, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized generalized linear model was adopted to identify the 20-ncRNA signature, and a diagnostic score was calculated for each sample according to the ncRNA expression levels and the model coefficients. The score demonstrated an excellent diagnostic ability for ASD in the training set (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]â€Š=â€Š0.96), validation set (AUCâ€Š=â€Š0.97) and the overall (AUCâ€Š=â€Š0.96). Moreover, the blood samples of 23 ASD patients and 23 age- and gender-matched controls were collected as the external validation set, in which the signature also showed a good diagnostic ability for ASD (AUCâ€Š=â€Š0.96). In subgroup analysis, the signature was also robust when considering the potential confounders of sex, age, and disease subtypes. In comparison with a 55-gene signature deriving from the same dataset, the ncRNA signature showed an obviously better diagnostic ability (AUC: 0.96 vs 0.68, Pâ€Š<â€Š.001). In conclusion, this study identified a robust blood ncRNA signature in diagnosing ASD, which might help improve the diagnostic accuracy for ASD in clinical practice.",2020,Medicine
Noninvasive prediction of lymph node status for patients with early-stage cervical cancer based on radiomics features from ultrasound images,"To investigate the feasibility of a noninvasive detection of lymph node metastasis (LNM) for early-stage cervical cancer (ECC) patients with radiomics methods based on the textural features from ultrasound images. One hundred seventy-two ECC patients between January 2014 and September 2018 with pathologically confirmed lymph node status (LNS) and preoperative ultrasound images were retrospectively reviewed. Regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated by a senior radiologist in the ultrasound images. LIFEx was applied to extract textural features for radiomics study. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was applied for dimension reduction and for selection of key features. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was adopted to build the radiomics signature. The Mannâ€“Whitney U test was applied to investigate the correlation between radiomics and LNS for both training and validation cohorts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the accuracy of the radiomics prediction models. A total of 152 radiomics features were extracted from ultrasound images, in which 6 features were significantly associated with LNS (p <â€‰0.05). The radiomics signatures demonstrated a good discrimination between patients with LNM and non-LNM groups. The best radiomics performance model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71â€“0.88) in the training cohort and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65â€“0.88) in the validation cohort. The feasibility of radiomics features from ultrasound images for the prediction of LNM in ECC was investigated. This noninvasive prediction method may be used to facilitate preoperative identification of LNS in patients with ECC. â€¢ Few studied had investigated the feasibility of radiomics based on ultrasound images for cervical cancer, even though it is the most common practice for gynecological cancer diagnosis and treatment. â€¢ The radiomics signatures based on ultrasound images demonstrated a good discrimination between patients with and without lymph node metastasis with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 and 0.77 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. â€¢ The radiomics model based on preoperative ultrasound images has the potential ability to predict lymph node status noninvasively in patients with early-state cervical cancer, so as to reduce the impact of invasive examination and to optimize the treatment choices.",2020,European Radiology
Abstract # 3143 Inflammatory markers in postpartum depression â€“ a sign of an exaggerated stress response?,"Compared with major depressive disorder, postpartum depression and its relation to immune activation and inflammation is less studied. Postpartum, after vast adaptations of the immune system during pregnancy, the immune system needs to return to a non-pregnant state, during a period of immune challenging events, such as wound healing, sleep loss, and a fall in levels of proteins and hormones. The study aim was to investigate potential differences in peripheral levels of immune related biomarkers in women with and without postpartum depression (nâ€¯=â€¯62 and 107 respectively). Among the 71 markers analyzed with multiplex proximity extension assay, five were significantly elevated in women with postpartum depressive symptoms in the adjusted LASSO logistic regression analysis, including TRANCE (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.20), HGF (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.17), IL-18 (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.06), FGF-23 (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.25), and CXCL1 (OR 1.11). Previously, HGF, IL-18 as well as FGF-23 have been reported lower in severe forms of depression while high levels of IL-18 and CXCL1 have been associated to stress responses. The delivery triggers stress-induced immune responses. Our results might be due to an elevated response to stress as immune reactions previously has been associated with exaggerated inflammation in women with depressive symptoms. Future research should evaluate the relevance of the identified markers, in combination with other known risk factors for postpartum depression. .",2019,"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity"
Detecting rare haplotype-environment interaction with logistic Bayesian LASSO.,"Two important contributors to missing heritability are believed to be rare variants and gene-environment interaction (GXE). Thus, detecting GXE where G is a rare haplotype variant (rHTV) is a pressing problem. Haplotype analysis is usually the natural second step to follow up on a genomic region that is implicated to be associated through single nucleotide variants (SNV) analysis. Further, rHTV can tag associated rare SNV and provide greater power to detect them than popular collapsing methods. Recently we proposed Logistic Bayesian LASSO (LBL) for detecting rHTV association with case-control data. LBL shrinks the unassociated (especially common) haplotypes toward zero so that an associated rHTV can be identified with greater power. Here, we incorporate environmental factors and their interactions with haplotypes in LBL. As LBL is based on retrospective likelihood, this extension is not trivial. We model the joint distribution of haplotypes and covariates given the case-control status. We apply the approach (LBL-GXE) to the Michigan, Mayo, AREDS, Pennsylvania Cohort Study on Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). LBL-GXE detects interaction of a specific rHTV in CFH gene with smoking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the AMD literature that an interaction of smoking with a specific (rather than pooled) rHTV has been implicated. We also carry out simulations and find that LBL-GXE has reasonably good powers for detecting interactions with rHTV while keeping the type I error rates well controlled. Thus, we conclude that LBL-GXE is a useful tool for uncovering missing heritability.",2014,Genetic epidemiology
Restoring Order Out of Chaos: Garbage Collection in Theory and Practice,"In 1807, Don Mariano Colasso, who lived in the southwestern part of the city, on Calle de Mesones at the corner of del Tompiate, was fined twelve reales for dumping human waste into the street. When asked why he continued with such activity, even though there were public laws against it, he replied that the house in which he lived did not have a latrine or a rubbish pit that he and his neighbors could use to contain their waste. Besides, he argued, as long as he could remember, residents of the city always left garbage in the street. This was part of popular custom, unchallenged by the residents of the viceregal capital. For him, the fine was a mere inconvenience that would not deter him from continuing to use public space as his personal dumping grounds.1",2010,
