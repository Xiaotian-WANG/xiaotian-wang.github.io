Marine natural products : integrated spectroscopic solutions for structure elucidation - eScholarship,"This dissertation describes the structure determination and biological activity of four groups of sponge derived secondary metabolites by integrated approaches using synthesis and circular dichroism. Chapter 2 describes the isolation and structure determination of brominated ene- yne tetrahydrofuran fatty acids, mutafurans A-G from the marine sponge Xestospongia muta. Two optically active ene- yne tetrahydrofuran model compounds were synthesized for chiroptical comparison to the natural product. Ene-yne and diyne alcohols and their corresponding naphthoate derivatives were synthesized for chiroptical studies. The antifungal activity of mutafurans A-G is reportedChapter 3 describes the identification of the feeding deterrent chemotype in the marine sponge Phorbas amaranthus against the common bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum. Two types of sulfated sterols were isolated from the highly deterrent polar extracts: amaranzoles A-F and amaroxocanes A and B. The structure determination of amaranzoles A and B was assisted by synthesis of optically active hydroxy- phenyl imidazole model compounds for comparison of NMR and CD to the natural products. Amaraoxocane B showed feeding deterrent activity against Thalassoma bifasciatum at higher than natural concentrations. Chapter 4 describes the identification of bis-piperidine alkaloids, xestoproxamines A-C from the marine sponge Neopetrosia proxima. The stereochemistry of the C23 methyl group in xestoproxamine C was elucidated by a Hoffman degradation/ cross metathesis protocol and comparison to an optically active model. A method was established to assign the absolute configuration of the bis-piperidine core in xestoproxamines A-C by chemical conversion to bis-p- bromophenacyl quaternary ammonium salts, and interpretation of the resulting ECCD spectra. The cytotoxic activity for xestoproxamines A-C is reported. Chapter 5 describes the isolation and structure determination of mollenyne A from Spirastrella mollis. The complete stereostructure was determined by a combination of NMR, CD, and chemical conversion. The biological activity for mollenyne A is reported",2011,

Nonlinear transport of the Wigner solid on superfluid 4He in a channel geometry.,"Nonlinear transport of electron crystal floating on superfluid 4He is investigated in channels 8 and 15 mum in width, where the electron velocity and driving electric field are uniform. At a high excitation, we observe a jump in the velocity caused by the decoupling of the electrons from the underlying surface deformation. The obtained driving field at the jump indicates that the decoupling occurs from the dynamically deepened surface deformation as a result of the Bragg-Cherenkov scattering of surface waves. Our results also account for the unusual nonlinear transport reported by Glasson et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 176802 (2001)10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.176802] considering the electrode geometry.",2009,Physical review letters
Adaptive structured subspace clustering algorithm,"Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) algorithm, founds a new pattern for the subspace clustering, and has led to the satisfactory results in many applications. SSC is implemented in two phases: learning a sparse affinity matrix and performing spectral clustering on the affinity matrix. However, SSC can not commendably cluster together the correlated data within cluster, as well as explicitly capture the natural relationship between the affinity matrix and the segmentation of the data. Motivated by some of the CASS and S3C algorithms, a combinatorial algorithm is presented in this paper. Using trace Lasso instead of l1 norm as regularization constraint, it can adaptively segment subspace and lead to more dense intra-cluster and more sparse inter-cluster. Using a joint optimization framework, it can organically connect two phases of SSC. The optimization model is solved by combining efficient alternating minimization and alternating direction method of multipliers. Experiments on Synthetic data, Handwritten Digits dataset, Extended Yale B and ORL facial databases demonstrate the effectiveness of ASSC approach.",2017,2017 3rd IEEE International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)
Split LBI: An Iterative Regularization Path with Structural Sparsity,"An iterative regularization path with structural sparsity is proposed in this paper based on variable splitting and the Linearized Bregman Iteration, hence called \emph{Split LBI}. Despite its simplicity, Split LBI outperforms the popular generalized Lasso in both theory and experiments. A theory of path consistency is presented that equipped with a proper early stopping, Split LBI may achieve model selection consistency under a family of Irrepresentable Conditions which can be weaker than the necessary and sufficient condition for generalized Lasso. Furthermore, some $\ell_2$ error bounds are also given at the minimax optimal rates. The utility and benefit of the algorithm are illustrated by applications on both traditional image denoising and a novel example on partial order ranking.",2016,
Structure of enteric helminth communities in two populations of Eptesicus fuscus (Chiroptera),"Twenty-one species of helminths were recovered from Eptesicus fuscus in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and thirteen species were collected from E. fuscus in St. Peter, Minnesota. Contingency table analyses of all species pairs from each locality detected no interactions in the St. Peter group. In the Eau Claire group the trematode pairs Paralecithodendrium naviculum â€“ Acanthatrium oligacanthum and Allassogonoporus marginalis â€“ Ochoterenatrema diminutum exhibited positive associations, whereas P. naviculum was negatively associated with the cestode Hymenolepis roudabushi. When the intestinal distribution of each species was summed over all hosts from each locality, the intestinal overlap of each species pair averaged 31% in bats from Eau Claire and 24% in bats from St. Peter. The overlaps dropped to 2% in bats from Eau Claire and 1% in those from St. Peter when intestinal distributions were not summed across hosts. A randomization analysis of intestinal distributions for all pairs of species from the two localitie...",1985,Canadian Journal of Zoology

Long-term outcomes of circumferential pulmonary-vein ablation and complex ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,"Objectives To compare the long-term outcomes of circumferential pulmonary-vein ablation (CPVA) and complex ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and to investigate the best ablation strategy and endpoint for PAF.Methods One hundred and forty one patients with PAF from January 2006 to August 2007 were randomized into two groups.All the patients underwent CPVA guided by CARTO system and single LASSO electrode.Group 1 underwent only CPVA.Group 2 underwent complex ablation including linear lesion,additional focal ablation and complex fraction atrial electrogram(CFAE) guided by the atrial arrhythmias during the procedures and inducement.We compared the ablation results and complications of the 2 groups.Results Six patients transferred to complex ablation due to the persistent atrial tachycardias (AT) during the procedures.We analyzed the results by on time-treatment, that was 64 patients in group 1 and 77 patients in group 2.There were no significant differences of age , sex, course of disease, left auricle diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction and procedure times between the 2 groups (P 0.05).Group 2 had a significant longer fluoroscopy time than group 1 [(39.8Â±14.2) min vs.(33.1Â±10.7) min, P=0.002].After a follow-up of (39.2Â±5.2) months, the recurrent rates of atrial arrhythmia were similar in two groups [23.4%(15/64) vs.26.0%(20/ 77),P=0.729].Five AT and 4 PAF patients in group 1 underwent redo.All the AT and 2 PAF were eliminated.There were 12 patients (6 AT and 6 PAF) in group 2 undergoing redo.Three mitral isthmus-related AT, 1 right atrial isthmus-related AT, 1 focal AT located at ostium of coronary sinus, and 3 PAF succeeded.The total successful rates were similar in the two groups [87.5%(56/64) vs.84.4%(65/77),P=0.603).Conclusions The successful rate of catheter ablation for PAF is high.CPVA for PAF, with less fluoroscopy time and atrial lesion, had a similar long-term outcomes with complex ablation.Targeting outside pulmonary veins would be important to improve successful rate during the repeated procedures.",2010,South China Journal of Cardiovascular Diseases
Groundwater effects on diversity and abundance of lagoonal seagrasses in Kenya and on Zanzibar Island (East Africa),"Seagrass species diversity and abundance were studied in East African back-reef lagoons with contrasting groundwater-outflow rates. The selection of the lagoons was based on a groundwater flow model. A total of 10 seagrass species was observed at all sites together. Sites with a higher groundwater outflow displayed a lower species diversity than sites with a lower groundwa- ter outflow. Thalassodendron ciliatum dominated at sites with high groundwater outflow rates, while Thalassia hemprichii showed higher coverage at sites with low groundwater outflow. Porewater salinities were up to 5 psu lower at locations with predicted high groundwater-outflow rates indicat- ing supply of freshwater. The reduction in porewater salinity at groundwater outflow sites is rela- tively low, which makes it unlikely that a difference in optimum salinity for growth is the main factor causing reduced diversity at these sites. Nitrogen-stable isotope signatures of seagrass leaves showed a significant increase with increased groundwater outflow rates. This suggests that the nitro- gen source for these plants was, at least in part, groundwater. Differences in competition for nitrogen may explain the observed pattern in species diversity and abundance. To establish a substantive link between the observed reduced seagrass diversity or enhanced Î´ 15 N values of T. ciliatum leaves on the one hand and increased groundwater outflow rates on the other, further exploration through detailed measurements of groundwater outflow rates and groundwater nitrogen isotopic composition are needed.",2002,Marine Ecology Progress Series
"Cytochrome b (Cyt-b) gene sequence analysis in six flatfish species (Teleostei, Pleuronectidae), with phylogenetic and taxonomic insights","Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) at Cyt-b gene region was sequenced for six flatfish species (in total nine sequences of at least 1,117Â bp) from the Far East of Russia and compared with other sequences of Pleuronectiformes comprising altogether 34 species and 3 outgroup species (Perciformes). Analysis of the protein-coding Cyt-b gene revealed a statistically substantiated bias in (TÂ +Â C):(AÂ +Â G) content, supporting earlier findings. Values of P-distances, as summarized for different scales of the evolutionary history at Cyt-b gene, revealed a clear pattern of increased nucleotide diversity at four different phylogenetic levels: (1) intraspecies, (2) intragenus, (3) intrafamily, and (4) intraorder. Scores of average P-distances of the four categories of comparison in flatfishes were (1) 0.46Â Â±Â 0.19%, (2) 11.74Â Â±Â 2.26%, (3) 17.51Â Â±Â 3.13%, and (4) 25.60Â Â±Â 0.42%, respectively (mean Â± SE). These data support the concept that speciation in the order Pleuronectiformes, in most cases, follows a geographic mode through the accumulation of numerous small genetic changes over a long period of time. A phylogenetic tree for 64 sequences of flatfishes and 3 other fishes belonging to ray-finned fishes (Actinopterigii) was developed using Cyt-b gene and four different analytical approaches: neighbour-joining (NJ), Bayesian (BA), maximum parsimony (MP), and maximum likelihood (ML). The analysis revealed a monophyletic origin for the representatives of Pleuronectidae, which is the principal flatfish family investigated (99% repetition level in our BA analysis). A well supported property of the phylogenetic tree was the monophyletic placement of all the five flatfish families and the order Pleuronectiformes among other representatives of ray-finned fishes of the class Actinopterigii. Species identification on per individual basis (barcoding tagging) was generally high. However, there were taxonomic complications that arose during analysis, and they are discussed. Major outcomes of this discussion are the necessity of synonymy acceptance for Hippoglossoides elassodon, and H. robustus, and for Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae and P. schrenki. Priority considerations suggest H. elassodon and P. yokohamae as valid species names.",2007,Marine Biology
Apolipoprotein CIII and Ljungan virus in diabetes,"It has been shown that there are patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), whose sera induce an increased activity of voltage-gated Ca-channels in pancreatic Î²-cells, resulting in increased cytoplasmic free Ca concentration ([Ca]i) and apoptosis. Purification of the protein in the active fraction of T1D sera revealed that the observed effects were mediated by apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII), and this protein was shown to be increased in serum from T1D patients. To be able to evaluate the importance of apoCIII in vivo for the development of T1D there is a need for a suitable animal model. We used the animal model diabetes-prone BB rat (DPBB) that spontaneously, at the age of around 60 days, develops a human-like T1D. Isolated islet cells cultured overnight in the presence of 10% sera from 60 days old prediabetic BB rats had a higher increase in [Ca]i upon depolarization with K, an impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion and a decreased viability, compared to cells exposed to age-matched control sera. The prediabetic sera with this effect are referred to as positive (pos). The effect on [Ca]i was abolished when an antibody against apoCIII was present during culture. The relative amounts of apoCIII in pos, neg and control sera from 60 days old rats were evaluated and the content in pos sera was significantly higher. To investigate the effects of apoCIII in vivo, DPBB rats were treated with either active or inactive antisense against apoCIII between the age of 12 to 40 days. The apoCIII antisense treatment significantly delayed the onset of diabetes. Wild bank voles (Myodes glareolus) develop T1D and a picornavirus, named Ljungan virus (LV), has been isolated from these animals. If CD-1 mice, that normally do not carry LV, are infected with this virus in utero and exposed to stress after birth, the male offspring get type 2 diabetes. In BB rats LV was found in both prediabeticand diabetic DPBB rats, as well as in diabetes-resistant rats. To evaluate if the presence of virus influences the onset of T1D, prediabetic rats were given antiviral treatments, which prolonged the prediabetic phase with approximately one week. The interplay between LV and diabetes is complicated and still not understood, and our data does not exclude a role of this virus in the development of diabetes. LIST OF PUBLICATIONS I.

"Seasonal relationships between foliar moisture content, heat content and biochemistry of lodgepole line and big sagebrush foliage","Wildland fires propagate by liberating energy contained within living and senescent plant biomass. The maximum amount of energy that can be generated by burning a given plant part can be quantified and is generally referred to as its heat content (HC). Many studies have examined heat content of wildland fuels but studies examining the seasonal variation in foliar HC among vegetation types are severely lacking. We collected foliage samples bi-weekly for five months from two common species in the western USA: lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon) and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt). We measured HC, live fuel moisture content (LFMC) and biochemical components in the leaf dry mass. Our results showed that HC increased for both species, coinciding with LFMC decrease during the growing season. Measured HC values were higher than the constant value in standard fuel models. Lasso regression models identified biochemical components for explaining temporal HC and LFMC variation in lodgepole pine (HC: R2adjâ€‰=â€‰0.55, root mean square error (RMSE)â€‰=â€‰0.35; LFMC: R2adjâ€‰=â€‰0.84, RMSEâ€‰=â€‰10.79), sagebrush (HC: R2adjâ€‰=â€‰0.90, RMSEâ€‰=â€‰0.13; LFMC: R2adjâ€‰=â€‰0.96, RMSEâ€‰=â€‰7.66) and combined data from both species (HC: R2adjâ€‰=â€‰0.77, RMSEâ€‰=â€‰0.33; LFMC: R2adjâ€‰=â€‰0.61, RMSEâ€‰=â€‰19.75). These results demonstrated the seasonal change in HC and LFMC resulted from temporal biochemical composition variation in dry mass. This new knowledge about HC seasonal change will ultimately lead to improved predictions of wildland fire spread and intensity.",2016,International Journal of Wildland Fire
Sparsity-assisted Fault Feature Enhancement: Algorithm-aware versus Model-aware,"Vibration signal analysis has become one of the important methods for machinery fault diagnosis. Extraction of weak fault features from vibration signals with heavy background noise remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we first introduce the idea of algorithm-aware sparsity-assisted methods for fault feature enhancement, which extends model-aware sparsity-assisted fault diagnosis and allows a more flexible and convenient algorithm design. In the framework of algorithm-aware methods, we define the generalized structured shrinkage operators and construct the generalized structured shrinkage algorithm (GSSA) to overcome the disadvantages of l1-norm regularization based fault feature enhancement methods. We then perform a series of simulation studies and two experimental cases to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, comparisons with model-aware methods, including basis pursuit denoising and windowed-group-lasso, and fast kurtogram further verify the advantages of GSSA for weak fault feature enhancement.",2020,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement
Implementation of Instrument Based on Eight Health Related Quality of Life Domains for Measuring of Willingness to Pay for Psoriasis Treatment,"Abstract Background: Psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) is a chronic skin condition that has a major impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Aim: To determine the individual burden of PsV on HRQOL using willingness to pay (WTP) instrument. Materials and methods: Fifty-one consecutive PsV patients were asked to evaluate their overall health and psoriasis affected health by visual analogue scale (VAS), and interviewed on 8 domains (physical, emotional, sleep, work, social, self-care, intimacy, and concentration) of HRQOL and WTP for a hypothetical cure in each domain. Two additional questions proposing 6 alternatives for therapy were also asked. The analysis is performed with descriptive and frequency statistics, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: The domains ranked highly were: physical comfort (90%), social comfort (77%), emotional health (75%) and work (53%). The following tendencies concerning WTP for top four impacted domains were found: the median WTP were the highest in the top impacted domains; the younger patients were willing to pay more than the older ones; the highest median WTP amounts appear in the lowest income group; the highest median WTP is associated with smaller psoriasis affected health VAS scores. The largest proportion and number of patients (37.3%, n=19) stated preferences for the systemic therapy. The second preferred choice was the thalassotherapy (29.4%, n=15). Conclusions: The utility and reliability of the instrument based on the assessment of WTP stated preferences for 8 domains of HRQOL for evaluation the individual burden of psoriasis were strongly supported.",2017,Folia Medica
On the Limnology of Deep and Saline Lake Burdur in Turkey,"Limnological characteristics of Lake Burdur in Lake District in south-western Turkey are presented. It is a deep, tectonic (estimated max. depth 100 m), athalassic, highly alkaline, and saline lake. A set of physical and chemical variables was monitored, phyto- and zooplankton was sampled from surface layer of the lake during 1997. Physico-chemical variables indicated that the lake is hyposaline and composed of some hydrochemically different water layers formed by groundwater sources located on the bottom of the lake. The phytoplankton composition of Lake Burdur consisted of Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Dinophyta, and Chrysophyta. The abundance and number of species of Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta were higher than the other taxa. The zooplankton composition of the Lake consisted of Rhizopoda, Rotifera, and Crustacea. Number of species of Rotifera was higher than the other taxa. The diversities of the phyto- and zooplankton were calculated according to the Shannon-Weaver diversity index. The diversity of each group was found to be low in the lake.

"Thalassomonas fusca sp. nov., a novel gammaproteobacterium isolated from tidal flat sediment","A Gram-negative, aerobic, non-motile, dark brown-coloured and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated G-MB1T, was isolated from a tidal flat sediment of the South Sea, South Korea. Strain G-MB1T was found to grow optimally at 25Â Â°C, at pH 7.0â€“8.0 and in the presence of 2.0Â % (w/v) NaCl. A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain G-MB1T fell within the clade comprising Thalassomonas species, clustering with the type strains of Thalassomonas agarivorans, Thalassomonas loyana, Thalassomonas ganghwensis and Thalassomonas agariperforans, with which it exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 96.0â€“96.9Â %. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values between strain G-MB1T and the type strains of the other Thalassomonas species were 94.6â€“95.1Â %. Strain G-MB1T was found to contain Q-8 as the predominant ubiquinone and C16:0, C17:1Ï‰8c, C16:1Ï‰9c, C12:0 3-OH and summed feature 3 (C16:1Ï‰7c and/or C16:1Ï‰6c) as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids of strain G-MB1T were phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and one unidentified aminolipid. The DNA G+C content of strain G-MB1T was determined to be 42.4Â mol%. Differential phenotypic properties, together with the phylogenetic distinctiveness, revealed that strain G-MB1T is separated from other Thalassomonas species. On the basis of the data presented, strain G-MB1T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Thalassomonas, for which the name Thalassomonas fusca sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is G-MB1T (=KCTC 32499TÂ =Â NBRC 109830T).",2013,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
Differential Network Analysis based on Omic Data for Cancer Biomarker Discovery,"Recent advances in high-throughput technique enables the generation of a large amount of omic data such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics etc. Typically, differential expression analysis (e.g., studentâ€™s t-test, ANOVA) is performed to identify biomolecules (e.g., genes, proteins, metabolites, glycans) with significant changes on individual level between biologically disparate groups (disease cases vs. healthy controls) for cancer biomarker discovery. However, differential expression analysis on independent studies for the same clinical types of patients often led to different sets of significant biomolecules and had only few in common. This may be attributed to the fact that biomolecules are members of strongly intertwined biological pathways and highly interactive with each other. Without considering these interactions, differential expression analysis could lead to biased results. Network-based methods provide a natural framework to study the interactions between biomolecules. Commonly used data-driven network models include relevance network, Bayesian network and Gaussian graphical models. In addition to data-driven network models, there are many publicly available databases such as STRING, KEGG, Reactome, and ConsensusPathDB, where one can extract various types of interactions to build knowledge-driven networks. While both dataand knowledge-driven networks have their pros and cons, an appropriate approach to incorporate the prior biological knowledge from publicly available databases into data-driven network model is desirable for more robust and biologically relevant network reconstruction. Recently, there has been a growing interest in differential network analysis, where the connection in the network represents a statistically significant change in the pairwise interaction between two biomolecules in different groups. From the rewiring interactions shown in differential networks, biomolecules that have strongly altered connectivity between distinct biological groups can be identified. These biomolecules might play an important role in the disease under study. In fact, differential expression and differential network analyses investigate omic data from two complementary perspectives: the former focuses on the change in individual biomolecule level between different groups while the latter concentrates on the change in pairwise biomolecules level. Therefore, an approach that can integrate differential expression and differential network analyses is likely to discover more reliable and powerful biomarkers. To achieve these goals, we start by proposing a novel data-driven network model (i.e., LOPC) to reconstruct sparse biological networks. The sparse networks only contains direct interactions between biomolecules which can help researchers to focus on the more informative connections. Then we propose a novel method (i.e., dwgLASSO) to incorporate prior biological knowledge into data-driven network model to build biologically relevant networks. Differential network analysis is applied based on the networks constructed for biologically disparate groups to identify cancer biomarker candidates. Finally, we propose a novel network-based approach (i.e., INDEED) to integrate differential expression and differential network analyses to identify more reliable and powerful cancer biomarker candidates. INDEED is further expanded as INDEED-M to utilize omic data at different levels of human biological system (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics), which we believe is promising to increase our understanding of cancer.

Source sparsity control of sound field reproduction using the elastic-net and the lasso minimizers.,"Sound field reproduction is aimed at the reconstruction of a sound pressure field in an extended area using dense loudspeaker arrays. In some circumstances, sound field reproduction is targeted at the reproduction of a sound field captured using microphone arrays. Although methods and algorithms already exist to convert microphone array recordings to loudspeaker array signals, one remaining research question is how to control the spatial sparsity in the resulting loudspeaker array signals and what would be the resulting practical advantages. Sparsity is an interesting feature for spatial audio since it can drastically reduce the number of concurrently active reproduction sources and, therefore, increase the spatial contrast of the solution at the expense of a difference between the target and reproduced sound fields. In this paper, the application of the elastic-net cost function to sound field reproduction is compared to the lasso cost function. It is shown that the elastic-net can induce solution sparsity and overcomes limitations of the lasso: The elastic-net solves the non-uniqueness of the lasso solution, induces source clustering in the sparse solution, and provides a smoother solution within the activated source clusters.",2017,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America
An Assessment of Geographic Information System Skills Used by Field-Level Natural Resource Managers,"tance of the need to teach digital geospatial technologies in forestry departments had forfeited studentsâ€™ capabilities to perform conventional aerial photo analysis. Also, the survey focused on several aspects of remote sensing curriculum, including aerial photo interpretation and photogrammetry, GIS, and nonphotographic remote sensing. At the time of this survey, the majority of the universities (88%, n 44) did offer a remote sensing class within their forestry department, but 12% (n 6) did not. Seventy-five percent of US universities required remote sensing. Of those, 7% did not offer the class within forestry or natural resources department and students enrolled in universities not offering a remote sensing class within their departments had to take the classes in other departments outside of forestry and natural resources to fulfill this area. Of the remote sensing courses offered in forestry departments, close to one-half of the coursework emphasized aerial photo analysis and nearly one-third focused on photogrammetry. Courses offered outside of forestry departments focused less on photo interpretation and photogrammetry than those classes offered within forestry departments. A follow-up survey conducted in 1998 (Sader and Vermillion 2000) contained similar content and sought to identify any significant changes in remote sensing education since the 1989 survey. In the 1988 survey, 75% of forestry departments required a remote sensing class and in the 1998 survey 80% of departments required the course in their curriculum. In this later survey, only one forestry program that required a course in remote sensing did not offer the course within their department. Both surveys reported median values of 40% of geospatial curricula focused on photo interpretation, 10% focused on nonphotographic remote sensing, and 30% focused on photogrammetry. The level of GIS education in the curricula increased from 5% in 1988 to 10% in 1998. In 1994, the Occupational Competencies Study Group within the Society of American Foresters (SAF) sought to assess the quality of training of recent college graduates (Brown and Lassoie 1998). The survey was sent to government agencies, consulting groups, and private corporations. Respondents were asked to identify which skill requirements were considered essential, highly desirable, desirable, or not necessary for entry-level foresters. Local and state government agencies along with consulting groups and private corporations identified spatial information systems (remote sensing, aerial photo interpretation, and GIS) as highly desirable skills for entry-level foresters to have obtained in college. All survey groups identified aerial photo interpretation as a highly desirable skill, with consulting groups ranking it as the most important of the geospatial skills. Federal agencies and consultants indicated that satellite imagery interpretation was a desirable skill for entry-level foresters. All groups indicated GIS management as a desirable skill set, with state and local agencies, private industry, and consulting groups ranking it higher in importance than federal",2007,
A complex version of the LASSO algorithm and its application to beamforming,"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) is a useful method to achieve coefficient shrinkage and data selection simultaneously. The central idea behind LASSO is to use the L1-norm constraint in the regularization step. In this paper, we propose an alternative complex version of the LASSO algorithm applied to beamforming aiming to decrease the overall computational complexity by zeroing some weights. The results are compared to those of the Constrained Least Squares and the Subset Selection Solution algorithms. The performance of nulling coefficients is compared to results from an existing complex version named the Gradient LASSO method. The results of simulations for various values of coefficient vector L1-norm are presented such that distinct amounts of null values appear in the coefficient vector. In this supervised beamforming simulation, the LASSO algorithm is initially fed with the optimum LS weight vector.

"Relationships between hyperspectral data and components of vegetation biomass in Low Arctic tundra communities at Ivotuk, Alaska","Warming in the Arctic has resulted in a lengthening of the growing season and changes to the distribution and composition of tundra vegetation including increased biomass quantities in the Low Arctic. Biomass has commonly been estimated using broad-band greenness indices such as NDVI; however, vegetation changes in the Arctic are occurring at spatial scales within a few meters. The aim of this paper is to assess the ability of hyperspectral remote sensing data to estimate biomass quantities among different plant tissue type categories at the North Slope site of Ivotuk, Alaska. Hand-held hyperspectral data and harvested biomass measurements were collected during the 1999 growing season. A subset of the data was used as a training set, and was regressed against the hyperspectral bands using LASSO. LASSO is a modification of SPLS and is a variable selection technique that is useful in studies with high collinearity among predictor variables such as hyperspectral remote sensing. The resulting equations were then used to predict biomass quantities for the remaining Ivotuk data. The majority of significant biomass-spectra relationships (65%) were for shrubs categories during all times of the growing season and bands in the blue, green, and red edge wavelength regions of the spectrum. The ability to identify unique biomass-spectra relationships per community is decreased at the height of the growing season when shrubs obscure lower-lying vegetation such as mosses. The results of this study support previous research arguing that shrubs are dominant controls over spectral reflectance in Low Arctic communities and that this dominance results in an increased ability to estimate shrub component biomass over other plant functional types.",2017,Environmental Research Letters
Bond rupture mechanisms in vitreous systems,"An experimental comparison was made between the breaking strength of fresh cleavage surfaces on various glasses and surface flaw parameters. A direct relationship was found between the product Nb of flaw length and number and the mean pressure to produce breakage in localized areas. This relationship was attributed to surface energy being utilized in flaw creation. A theory is advanced that a localized force causes a part of the mechanical stress to be relieved by flaw surface energy, producing a confined region of plastic deformation. Flaw formation in fused silica was observed to be less extensive and, as a consequence, the structure supported less localized force than commercial glasses before fracturing. The fused quartz structure was modified by adding sodium and calcium oxides; these three component glasses also disclosed the direct relation between Nb and the breaking force. By employing a dynamic indenter tool, quantitative flaw formation in systems such as fused and crystalline quartz is compared with other structures. Both quantitative and qualitative types of flaw formation are discussed in relation to plastic flow phenomena in vitreous networks.RÃ©sumÃ©Une comparaison expÃ©rimentale a Ã©tÃ© Ã©tablie entre la force de rupture de surfaces de clivage fraiches sur diffÃ©rents verres et les paramÃ©tres de dÃ©faut superficiels.

Cette relation est attribuÃ©e Ã  l'Ã©nergie superficielle utilisÃ©e pour la crÃ©ation du dÃ©faut.

Multivariate Statistical Process Control Using LASSO,"This article develops a new multivariate statistical process control (SPC) methodology based on adapting the LASSO variable selection method to the SPC problem. The LASSO method has the sparsity property of being able to select exactly the set of nonzero regression coefficients in multivariate regression modeling, which is especially useful in cases where the number of nonzero coefficients is small. In multivariate SPC applications, process mean vectors often shift in a small number of components. Our primary goals are to detect such a shift as soon as it occurs and to identify the shifted mean components. Using this connection between the two problems, we propose a LASSO-based multivariate test statistic, and then integrate this statistic into the multivariate EWMA charting scheme for Phase II multivariate process monitoring. We show that this approach balances protection against various shift levels and shift directions, and thus provides an effective tool for multivariate SPC applications.

Adolescent age estimation using voice features.,"In this paper, a method for evaluating the chronological age of adolescents on the basis of their voice signal is presented. For every examined child, the vowels a, e, i, o and u were recorded in extended phonation. Sixty voice parameters were extracted from each recording. Voice recordings were supplemented with height measurement in order to check if it could improve the accuracy of the proposed solution. Predictor selection was performed using the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) algorithm. For age estimation, the random forest (RF) for regression method was employed and it was tested using a 10-fold cross-validation. The lowest absolute error (0.37 yearâ€‰Â±â€‰0.28) was obtained for boys only when all selected features were included into prediction. In all cases, the achieved accuracy was higher for boys than for girls, which results from the fact that the change of voice with age is larger for men than for women. The achieved results suggest that the presented approach can be employed for accurate age estimation during rapid development in children.",2020,Biomedizinische Technik. Biomedical engineering
A Statistical Method for Constructing Tang Poet Social Networks,"Existing scholarship on Tang Poetry often focuses on linguistics or the cultural and social impact of selected poets. In this paper, a method was developed for constructing a Tang poet network based on natural language processing and statistical graphical learning. The proposed method used Tang poems from Quan Tang Shi as the data source and contained a few major steps: disambiguate poet names via China Biographical Database, build a document-poet matrix, and infer Tang poet networks via Poisson Graphical Lasso. The inferred Tang poet networks were then evaluated and discussed. The Tang poet networks constructed in this study will benefit humanity scholars and poetry lovers alike, and the method developed can, with minor modifications, be reused by other scholars with similar research interests in Chinese literature.",2020,2020 IEEE 14th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC)
Evaluation of natural diatomaceous earth deposits from south-eastern Europe for stored-grain protection: the effect of particle size.,"BACKGROUND
The use of diatomaceous earths (DEs) provides a promising alternative to the use of contact insecticides in stored-product IPM. Geographical origin and the physical properties of a given DE may affect its insecticidal activity. In the present study, DE samples were collected from different locations of south-eastern Europe, and their efficacy was evaluated in the laboratory against Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) (Coleoptera: Cucujiidae), Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae). In addition, three fractions comprising particles of different size were obtained from each DE sample and assessed with regards to their effectiveness against the above stored-product insect pests.


RESULTS
DE from the Greek region of Elassona was the most effective against C. ferrugineus and S. oryzae, whereas the DE Kolubara 518, mined in the Serbian region of Kolubara, was the most effective against R. dominica. Smaller particles were more effective than larger particles against the three tested species, although significant differences in the efficacy of fractions containing particles of 0-150 microm and particles with sizes of < 45 microm were not always recorded.


CONCLUSIONS
Deposits from south-eastern Europe appeared to be very effective against the tested species, and therefore this region should be further evaluated as a source of development of commercial products. Particle size is a physical property that should always be taken into account during the DE manufacturing process, as it can strongly influence the insecticidal action of a given product.",2009,Pest management science
"Platinum-group Elements in Tulameen Coal, British Columbia, Canada--a Discussion","sures at the Blakeburn opencast pit was due to selective fixation by organic complexing of Au and PGE carried as solute or colloidal suspensions. Anomalously high concentrations of PGE in fault zones were explained by enhanced ground-water flow along more permeable channelways which promoted greater fluid-rock (coal) interactions. Two sources for the PGE were identified: an external Pt-rich source, the nearby Tulameen Ultramafic Complex; and an internal source comprising volcanic units interbedded with the coal, including tonsteins, bentonites, and basalt. On the basis of the relative abundances of Pt, Pd and Au in stream sediments, coals, and ultramafic rocks of the Tulameen Complex, Van der Flier-Keller (1991, p. 394) further proposed that the precipitation of PGE from ground waters could also account for the origin of these metals in alluvial placers of the region. It was the latter conclusion, requiring wholesale mobility and precipitation of PGE in the surficial environment, that prompted a close examination of the data that led Van der Flier-Keller to favor a low-temperature origin for PGE in coals and alluvial sediments of the Tulameen district. Previously, Raicevic and Cabri (1976) and Nixon et al. (1990) had documented a magmatic origin for platinum-group minerals in Tulameen placers and demonstrated a genetic link with chromitites in the core of the Tulameen Ultramafic Complex. Of course, there are many well-documented examples of the mobility and hydromorphic dispersion of noble metals (to varying degrees) during surface weathering of rocks and ores (e.g., Taufen and Marchetto, 1990; Wood and Vlassopoulos, 1990). In addition, experimental and theoretical work has demonstrated the ability of organic acids to complex with PGE in aqueous solutions (e.g., Wood, 1990; Plimer and Williams, 1987). However, given our present state of knowledge of the distribution of PGE in coal (Swaine, 1990), it seems unwise to invoke some poorly understood process uch as regional hydromorphic dispersion of PGE in order to account for subeconomic concentrations of these metals in coal when other more conventional mecha-",2005,
Estimation of Cauliflower Weight Based on Multiple Linear Regression Modelling,"In view of the problem that the traditional electronic scale can't predict the prenatal yield of the cauliflower, which having the characteristics of irregular shape and uneven density distribution. In this paper a method is proposed to predict the weight of the cauliflower based on multiple linear regression models. Using Kinect scanning equipment to obtain 3D model of cauliflower, the length, width, height, max_area and volume of the cauliflower 3D model were selected as features. The optimal parameters of the two regularized models, ridge regression and LASSO were selected by cross-validation. In this paper, the K-fold cross-validation (K = 5) was used to divide and select the test set and the train set for small sample. Ridge Regression and LASSO models, as well as optimized models, were evaluated using decision coefficients and relative errors. The experimental results were compared and analyzed. The results show that the optimized LASSO model has the best prediction accuracy for the weight of cauliflower.",2018,
"Karbonat- und Lignitzyklen im Ptolemais-Becken: orbitale Steuerung und suborbitale VariabilitÃ¤t (SpÃ¤tneogen, NW-Griechenland)","KURZFASSUNG Die mio-pliozanen Ablagerungen im NNW ï¿½ SSE streichenden Monastir-Florina-Ptolemais-Kozani/Servia-Graben beherbergen das groste zusammenhangende Braunkohlevorkommen in Bereich des Balkans. Das Becken erstreckt sich von Monastir (F.Y.R.O.M.) im Norden bis hin zur Region von Elassona im Suden (Makedonien/GR). Es umfasst eine Gesamtflache von ca. 120 kmÂ². Mittlerweile werden ca. 71 % des elektrischen Energiebedarfs der Hauptstadt Athen durch die Energiegewinnung aus dem MFPK/S-G gedeckt. Diese rhythmisch entwickelten Lignitvorkommen zeigen, neben den bedeutenden wirtschaftlichen Aspekten, ein groses Potential fur eine Palaoklima-Analyse des nordostlichen mediterranen Raums. Das Neogen zeigt einen multiplen Wechsel von Kalt- und Warmzeiten mit vereinzelt deutlich hoheren Temperaturen als heute an (Bradley, 1999). Die Ursachen hierfur konnen u.a. auf Variationen der Erdbahnparameter zuruckgefuhrt werden, welche Schwankungen in der Insolation verursachen und somit das atmospharisch-ozeanische System steuern. Zeitreihenanalysen belegten bereits in den 70er bis spaten 90er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts diese Variationen innerhalb mariner (Hays et al., 1976; Imbrie & Imbrie, 1980) und kontinentaler Ablagerungen (Santarelli et al., 1988, van Vugt et al., 1998. Die Ursachen und Steuerungsprozesse dieser Variationen sind von Milankovitch (1920, 1930, 1941) eingehenst diskutiert worden. Er nahm an, dass die Sonneneinstrahlung, die masgebliche Ursache fur langerfristige Schwankungen ist. Folgernd mussten diese orbitalen Parameter mit signifikanten Veranderungen der saisonalen Variationen einhergehen. Hierbei handelt es sich insbesondere um die Exzentrizitat der Erdumlaufbahn (123 ï¿½ 98 ka Zyklus), die Schiefe der Ekliptik (50 ï¿½ 41 ka Zyklus) und die Prazession der Erdachse (23 ï¿½ 19 ka Zyklus). Spektralanalysen von Klimadaten belegen, dass die Schiefe der Ekliptik und die Prazession die saisonal-raumliche Verteilung der Insolation beeinflussen (Berger, 1988). Erstere kontrolliert vor allem die Lange der Jahreszeiten und zeigt ihren grosten Effekt innerhalb borealer Breiten. Letztere hat zur Folge, dass die im Perihel sonnenzugewandte Hemisphare im Sommer eine hohere Insolation erreicht, aber aufgrund der unterschiedlichen Erdumlaufbahngeschwindigkeiten auch einen kurzeren Sommer aufweist. Dem entgegengesetzt zeigt die ubrige Hemisphare einen starkeren Insolationskontrast. Zielsetzung der Dissertation ist die Untersuchung der rhythmisch entwickelten neogenen (mio-pliozanen/Komnina und Ptolemais Formation) Lignit-Abfolgen des Ptolemais-Grabens und der Nachweis der bereits erwahnten periodischen und evtl. vorhandenen, quasi periodischen Klimazyklen. Die palaomagnetischen Resultate ergeben fur den grosten Teil der untersuchten Proben eine stabile Richtung mit steiler inverser und flacher bis steiler normaler Inklination. Hierbei handelt es sich uberwiegend um Proben, die eine Ein- bzw. Zweikomponentenremanenz aufweisen. Wechselfeldstabilen Remanenzen, welche innerhalb aller Abfolgen zu beobachten sind, werden fur die magnetostratigraphische Auswertung und die Konstruktion der Polaritatsskala und deren Korrelation an der astronomischen Polaritatszeitskala (APTS) (Shackleton et al., 1990, 1995, Hilgen et al., 1995) nicht berucksichtigt. Generell zeigen die oberneogenen Proben, mit Ausnahme der Sektion Lava, relativ niedrige Magnetisierungbetrage, welche eine geringe Prasenz ferrimagnetischer Komponenten belegen. Aus den Ergebnissen der Gesteinsmagnetik wird ferner eine relativ inhomogene Magnetominerlogie ersichtlich. Diese ist uberwiegend reprasentiert durch die Eisenoxide (Magnetit, Hamatit) und die Eisensulfide (Greigit, Pyrrhotit). Das Variationsmuster dieser Zyklen, welche innerhalb der astronomischen Reihenentwicklung Perioden von 128.2 ï¿½ 95, 53.6 ï¿½ 39.7, 23.7 ï¿½ 18.9 ka und Submilankovitch-Bander erfassen, wurde durch Zeitreihen verschiedener hochauflosender spektrophotometrischer (L*,a*,b*,DE*ab,C*,h) und geophysikalischer (Gamma-Ray-Log und Suszeptibilitat) Skalare nachgewiesen. Diese hochauflosenden Proxydaten werden ferner mit einer numerischen Frequenzanalyse naher untersucht. Die hieraus resultierende Filterung der Datensets belegen eine Hierarchie von Zyklen beginnend mit den niederfrequenten Milankovitchzyklen hin zu einer hoherfrequenten suborbitalen Variabilitat. Folglich kann eine Interpretation dieser schon visuell erkennbaren Hell-/Dunkel-Bankungen (sog. Zebraschichtung) mit uberwiegend klimatischen Kontext in Betracht gezogen werden. Eine Vielzahl weiterer Proxys(Gesteinsmagnetik, Auflichtmikroskopie, XRD) liefert erganzende palaoklimatische- und palaoumweltbezogene Erkenntnisse. Das vorliegende Fallbeispiel zeigt somit, dass limnische Kohleabfolgen genauso gut als terrestrische Klima-Archive angesehen werden konnen wie marine Sektionen. Die Variabilitat dieses relativ kleinraumigen Gebietes erlaubt es folglich eine Bewertung grosregionalerer Klimatrends vorzunehmen.",2009,
Spatial Dispersion and Nonmigratory Spawning in the Bluehead Wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum),"Earlier studies of the behavior of the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum have shown it to be a migratory spawner with large terminal-phase males defending temporary spawning territories. We describe a variant social structure where fish occupy permanent home ranges, spawn within or near these home ranges, and are not territorial. Movements of identified terminal-phase and intermediate males and females were mapped in the backreef areas of three coral reefs in Puerto Rico. Locations of spawns were then compared with these home-range maps. All fish used most or all of their morning home range during the afternoon spawning period. Both terminal-phase males and females spawned within or near their home ranges. Males were relatively tolerant of other males during the afternoon spawning period: only one in five encounters between large males resulted in aggressive chases. The location of chases bore no relation to spawning sites, areas of morning foraging, or to home-range borders. A Monte Carlo computer simulation was used to measure home-range dispersion of terminal-phase and intermediate males at our main site. If males were territorial, we should expect their home ranges to be significantly overdispersed within the cumulative area they occupied. During the first year male home ranges were overdispersed but during the second year they were randomly dispersed, even though the same number of terminal-phase males occupied the same study site both years. Differences in social behavior between backreef areas and other areas reported in the literature, and found in other portions of our reefs, may be related to differences in feeding ecology between populations and between different portions of the same reef.",2010,Ethology
"[Morbidity and mortality related to obstetrical referral patients to the hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso].","The obstetrical referral patients admitted to the Sanon Souro hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) during 1991 were retrospectively reviewed. During the study period 741 women were admitted. The median distance between the referring centre and Bobo-Dioulasso was 33 km. Median age was 22 years and median parity was 3. Indications for referral were dominated by obstructed labour, haemorrhages and infections. The proportion of maternal mortality in the study was 5.4% and was not related to maternal age or parity. However, there was a linear trend of increasing mortality according to the distance between the referring centre and Bobo-Dioulasso (X2 for trend: 7.56; p = 0.006). The perinatal mortality rate of 420 p. thousand was not related to maternal age, but a parity exceeding 4 was a risk factor for the occurrence of perinatal death (relative risk: 1.4; 95% C.I.: 1.2-1.7). As for maternal mortality, there was a linear increase of perinatal mortality with the distance from the referring centre (X2: 20.8; p = 0.00001). There was no marked seasonal variation in the number of referrals nor in the mortality rates per month.",1993,Annales de la Societe belge de medecine tropicale
Model-driven parametric monitoring of high-dimensional nonlinear functional profiles,"In order to cope with system complexity and dynamic environments, modern industries are investing in a variety of sensor networks and data acquisition systems to increase information visibility. Multi-sensor systems bring the proliferation of high-dimensional functional profiles that capture rich information on the evolving dynamics of natural and engineered processes. This provides an unprecedented opportunity for online monitoring of operational quality and integrity of complex systems. However, the classical methodology of statistical process control is not concerned about high-dimensional sensor signals and is limited in the capability to perform multi-sensor fault diagnostics. It is not uncommon that multi-dimensional sensing capabilities are not fully utilized for decision making. This paper presents a new model-driven parametric monitoring strategy for the detection of dynamic fault patterns in high-dimensional functional profiles that are nonlinear and nonstationary. First, we developed a sparse basis function model of high-dimensional functional profiles, thereby reducing the large amount of data to a parsimonious set of model parameters (i.e., weight, shifting and scaling factors) while preserving the information. Further, we utilized the lasso-penalized logistic regression model to select a low-dimensional set of sensitive predictors for fault diagnostics. Experimental results on real-world data from patient monitoring showed that the proposed methodology outperforms traditional methods and effectively identify a sparse set of sensitive features from high-dimensional datasets for process monitoring and fault diagnostics.",2014,2014 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)
Factorial Graphical Lasso and Slowly Changing Graphical Models for Estimating Dynamic Networks,"Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex networks such asgenomic networks. A genomic network is a system of relationships between geneswhich are represented by nodes. The relationships, which are conditional dependences,between genes are represented by links. If we do not have any informationabout the presence or absence of links, then we need to recover these links from thedata. The complexity of estimating network structures results from the very largenumber of possible models, that is given by 2C(p;2) where C(p;2) is the binomialcoefficient and p is the number of nodes. Surprisingly, penalized graphical modelscan be applied to recover network structures even if p is large relatively to thenumber of observations. However, penalized graphical models do not consider thedynamic of the networks. We propose two new models, the factorial graphical lassoand the slowly changing graphical model, to estimate complex dynamic networks.",2012,
Stabilizing the lasso against cross-validation variability,"An abundance of high-dimensional data has meant that L""1 penalized regression, known as the lasso, has become an indispensable tool of the practitioner. A feature of the lasso is a ''tuning'' parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients. In practice, a value for the tuning parameter is chosen using the method of cross-validation. It is shown that the model that is selected by the lasso can be extremely sensitive to the fold assignment used for cross-validation. A consequence of this sensitivity is that the results from a lasso analysis can lack interpretability. To overcome this model-selection instability of the lasso, a method called the percentile-lasso is introduced. The model selected by the percentile-lasso corresponds to the model selected by the lasso, when the lasso is fitted using an appropriate percentile of the possible ''optimal'' tuning parameter values. It is demonstrated that the percentile-lasso can achieve substantial improvements in both model-selection stability and model-selection error compared to the lasso. Importantly, when applied to real data the percentile-lasso, unlike the lasso, produces interpretable results, that is, results that are robust to the assignment of observations to folds for cross-validation. The percentile-lasso is easily applied to extensions of the lasso and in the context of penalized generalized linear models.",2014,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Applying strategic environmental assessment to land-use and resource-management plans in Scotland and New Zealand: a comparison,"Case studies are used to compare the use of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) Scotland and New Zealand by applying the Glasson-Gosling typology of SEA practice. The results suggest SEA's effectiveness in promoting sustain-ability is determined by its capacity to shape the decision-making processes governing all aspects of spatial development. New Zealand's Resource Management Act confines SEA to evaluating environmental aspects of territorial land-use and resource-management plans. Without efforts to integrate SEA into new community planning powers under the 2002 Local Government Act, this will limit its use in supporting broader sus-tainability objectives. Scotland's recent Environmental Assessment Act embraces all public-sector policies, plans and programmes, offering SEA more scope for influencing policy formulation and the delivery of sustainable development.",2006,Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal
"Some Important Microbial Agents of Nosocomial Infections, Their Sources and Modes of Transmissions","The hospital environment usually becomes contaminated with many pathogens, that are directly or indirectly derived from the various sources of the hospitals and patients itself. These microbial agents give rise to many hospitalassociated infections, called â€˜Nosocomial infectionsâ€™. Such micro-organisms are most commonly Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, viruses, drug-resistant pathogens, and other infectious agents. The commonly prevalent nosocomial or hospital-acquired infections usually include urinary tract infections, surgical wounds, infections of respiratory tracts, and intestinal site infections. The sources of infections are external and internal as well, and transmission takes place through different routes.

[Nosocomial Legionnaires' disease--results from the analysis of Germany's surveillance data; 2004-2006].,"Legionella bacteria colonize drinking water systems and can cause severe pneumonia in humans (Legionnaires' disease (LD)). The German network for community-acquired pneumonia (CAPNETZ) estimates 15,000-30,000 new cases of LD per year in Germany. LD cases are divided into those that were acquired in the context of a stay in a hospital or nursing home (healthcare-associated; HCA), in the community (community-acquired (CA)) or during travel (travelassociated (TA)). According to the recommendations of the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC; UK) and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC; USA) a single case of nosocomial LD should prompt an epidemiologic and, depending on its results, also technical investigation of the institution. In this study we present data from nosocomial cases of LD in the context of all cases of LD that were reported to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) within the mandatory surveillance system from 2004 through 2006. We calculated the number of cases per population (incidence), the number of cases per person-days at risk (incidence rate) and case fatality. The analysis comprised 1,339 cases of LD. Among the 942 cases with one of the three categories of exposure CALD was reported in 58 % (547 cases), TALD in 29 % (270 cases) and HCA-LD in 13 % (125 cases). The incidence rate of TALD was 9-fold, but that of HCA-LD 15-fold higher than that of CALD. Case fatality of HCA-LD was 13 % and thus higher than that of CALD (9 %) and TALD (5 %). HCA-LD cases were reported from all states and included 77 different counties. Reporting counties represent the place of residence of the LD case-patients. German notification data show that cases of LD, and likely also HCALD, are underreported. Incidence rate and case fatality are highest in HCA-LD. HCA-LD occurs widespread. These results and the preventability of HCA-LD support the recommendation to thoroughly investigate single cases of HCA-LD in hospitals and nursing homes.",2009,"Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz"
Identification of hospital cost drivers using sparse group lasso,"Public hospital spending consumes a large share of government expenditure in many countries. The large cost variability observed between hospitals and also between patients in the same hospital has fueled the belief that consumption of a significant portion of this funding may result in no clinical benefit to patients, thus representing waste. Accurate identification of the main hospital cost drivers and relating them quantitatively to the observed cost variability is a necessary step towards identifying and reducing waste. This study identifies prime cost drivers in a typical, mid-sized Australian hospital and classifies them as sources of cost variability that are either warranted or not warranted-and therefore contributing to waste. An essential step is dimension reduction using Principal Component Analysis to pre-process the data by separating out the low value 'noise' from otherwise valuable information. Crucially, the study then adjusts for possible co-linearity of different cost drivers by the use of the sparse group lasso technique. This ensures reliability of the findings and represents a novel and powerful approach to analysing hospital costs. Our statistical model included 32 potential cost predictors with a sample size of over 50,000 hospital admissions. The proportion of cost variability potentially not clinically warranted was estimated at 33.7%. Given the financial footprint involved, once the findings are extrapolated nationwide, this estimation has far-reaching significance for health funding policy.",2018,PLoS ONE
Root Cause Analysis by a Combined Sparse Classification and Monte Carlo Approach,"Abstract Classification methods with embedded feature selection capability are very appealing for the analysis of complex processes since they allow the analysis of root causes even when the number of input variables is high. In this work, we investigate the performance of three techniques for classification within a Monte Carlo strategy with the aim of root cause analysis. We consider the naive bayes classifier and the logistic regression model with two different implementations for controlling model complexity, namely, a LASSO-like implementation with a l 1 norm regularization and a fully Bayesian implementation of the logistic model, the so called relevance vector machine. Several challenges can arise when estimating such models mainly linked to the characteristics of the data: a large number of input variables, high correlation among subsets of variables, the situation where the number of variables is higher than the number of available data points and the case of unbalanced datasets. Using an ecological and a semiconductor manufacturing dataset, we show advantages and drawbacks of each method, highlighting the superior performance in term of classification accuracy for the relevance vector machine with respect to the other classifiers. Moreover, we show how the combination of the proposed techniques and the Monte Carlo approach can be used to get more robust insights into the problem under analysis when faced with challenging modelling conditions.",2014,IFAC Proceedings Volumes

Near-infrared spectrum discriminant analysis based on information extraction by using the elastic net,"Elastic net method combines the merits of ridge regression and Lasso method. It reduces model prediction error by variable selection while not over-shrinking regression coefficients. In this paper, we take advantages of the elastic net's good properties of variable selection and simultaneous parameter estimation to select the important principal components, then establish discriminant model and apply it to near-infrared spectroscopy quantitative analysis. In the real data set analysis, 103 rhubarb samples were randomly split into two groups, one is viewed as training set which contains 35 samples, another group is considered as testing set which contains 68 samples. All of the samples' protein contents are measured by the national standard Kjeldahl method and the data were called chemical values. In order to testify feasibility and stability of the method, the training set and testing set were conducted random split and analyzed for ten times, respectively. According to these predicting results, the maximum number of false positives was 10, the minimum number of false positives is 5, and average false positive rate is 11.76%. These results showed a significant improvement compared to the results which derived by using ordinary principal component method directly.",2015,2015 11th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)
Grouped variable selection in high dimensional partially linear additive Cox model,"In the analysis of survival outcome supplemented with both clinical information and high-dimensional gene expression data, traditional Cox proportional hazard model fails to meet some emerging needs in biological research. First, the number of covariates is generally much larger the sample size. Secondly, predicting an outcome with individual gene expressions is inadequate because a geneâ€™s expression is regulated by multiple biological processes and functional units. There is a need to understand the impact of changes at a higher level such as molecular function, cellular component, biological process, or pathway. The change at a higher level is usually measured with a set of gene expressions related to the biological process. That is, we need to model the outcome with gene sets as variable groups and the gene sets could be partially overlapped also. In this thesis work, we investigate the impact of a penalized Cox regression procedure on regularization, parameter estimation, variable group selection, and nonparametric modeling of nonlinear effects with a time-to-event outcome. We formulate the problem as a partially linear additive Cox model with high-dimensional data. We group genes into gene sets and approximate the nonparametric components by truncated series expansions with B-spline bases. After grouping and approximation, the problem of variable selection becomes that of selecting groups of coefficients in a gene set or in an approximation. We apply the group Lasso to obtain an initial solution path and reduce the dimension of",2019,
"A Soldier's Shame: The Specter of Captivity in ""La Historia del Cautivo""","Al estudiar el personaje del Capitan Ruy Perez de Viedma de Don Quijote, este ensayo propone la existencia de un fenomeno que llamo el espectro del cautiverio: una continua afliccion afectiva inscrita en la figura del cautivo que se manifiesta sobre todo en la expresion de la emocion de la verguenza. Esta verguenza tiene su origen en varios codigos culturales de la Espana imperial, entre los cuales se contempla el estigma que acompanaba al cautivo espanol debido a la sospecha de apostasia y la percepcion popular del cautiverio como una experiencia contaminante. Afligido por el espectro del cautiverio, el Capitan tiene que depender de su talento retorico al narrar su historia para asi disipar esta sospecha y ser aceptado por los demas huespedes de la venta. Las dimensiones sociales de este intercambio narrativo, consecuentes con la concepcion aristotelica de la emocion y fundamentales para la estetica cervantina, prescriben la necesidad de un dialogo publico para resolver cargas emocionales fuertes y enfrentar a su vez los asuntos politicos y eticos de los que se nutren. ********** Le capture apparait donc toujours comme frappe d'une tare originelle et indelebile qui pesera sans fin sur son destin. CLAUDE MEILLASSOUX MANY OF THE POLITICAL, economic, and religious anxieties of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Mediterranean were brought to bear upon and largely embodied in the figure of the captive, a living commodity whose circulation in turn permeated the consciousness of Spanish national identity and informed the construction of an early modern political, popular, and literary imaginary. (1) Much as the Mediterranean was a contested space of empire, the captive can be read as a contested body which is affected and inscribed by imperial forces, a body imprisoned and marked indefinitely by its encounter with the otherness of captivity. For despite many attempts at defining the legal status of the captive in the theoretical, philosophical, and juridical writings of scholars from Aristotle to Francisco de Vitoria, the Mediterranean powers of the early modern era were far from establishing a practical consensus on the ethically problematic nature of captivity. Many authors of the period contributed to this debate by exploring the complex status of the captive in their fictional writing as well especially Cervantes, whose own captivity in Algiers greatly influenced his literary production. (2) The contentious nature of the captive is apparent even in the etymology of the term itself. According to Joan Corominas's dictionary, cautivo ""significo 'infeliz, desdichado'"" (735). Furthermore, the term cautivo ""supone inocencia; excita sentimientos de confraternidad, de compasion y de ternura, y trae consigo la idea de las mazmorras, de los grillos y cadenas, y de los padecimientos en general; y por esta razon se han apoderado los poetas de las voces cautivo, cautiverio, o cautividad para expresar las penas del amor"" (Roque Barcia 824). Accordingly, the term cautiva connotes an important sociohistorical meaning that was related precisely to Mediterranean slavery in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. But this definition indicates that the captive was laden with an affective content as well, conjuring strong feelings of pathos and palpable images of dungeons and chains. (3) It is these affective registers of captivity that I would like to explore in this present essay. By studying the character of Captain Ruy Perez de Viedma (of ""La historia del cautivo"") in Don Quijote (1.37-42:456-521), I will posit the existence of what I will call the specter of captivity: an excess of affect and affliction that continues to haunt the captive well after his liberation from imprisonment. I further define the specter of captivity as the complex emotional burden manifested through the (in)action of the captive and the insistent need to conceal his condition from the recognition or gaze of the other. â€¦",2011,
Discovery of the Jurassic Strata in the North-East Sag of South Yellow Sea,"Based on the newly drilled well S1 and seismic data in north-east sag, northern depression, South Yellow Sea, this paper analyzed the seismic reflective features and lithology of the well S1 in detail. In order to constrain the age of the target strata,paleontological and Sporopollen study is carried out for core samples. Based on the result of these studies and the regional correlation,it is proposed that the target strata are Middle-Late Jurassic in age. From lithologic association and Sporoplllen assemblages, the drilled strata can be divided into two parts, the upper one is dominated by Gymosperm pollen especially Classopollis and the lower one has high contents of Cyathea spores and Classopollis. According to the well-seismic calibration, the 2D seismic interpretation is tracked throughout the sag, it is showed that the Jurassic strata in this sag get increasingly thicker from southeast to northwest in sedimentary framework.We suggested that the Qianliyan uplifted zone in the north side of the sag may be the main provenance for the Jurassic strata.",2014,Geological Journal of China Universities
Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis for Materials Science: Stability and Transferability of Fingerprint Descriptors and Chemical Insights,"In the paradigm of virtual high-throughput screening for materials, we have developed a semiautomated workflow or â€œrecipeâ€ that can help a material scientist to start from a raw data set of materials with their properties and descriptors, build predictive models, and draw insights into the governing mechanism.

At the heart of our methodology lies the Bootstrapped Projected Gradient Descent (BoPGD) algorithm, which has significant advantages over commonly used machine learning (ML) and statistical analysis (SA) tools such as the regression coefficient shrinkage-based method (LASSO) or artificial neural networks: (a) it selects descriptors with greater stability and transferability, with a goal to understand the chemical mechanism rather ...",2017,Chemistry of Materials
[Female sterilization in Burkina Faso: 142 cases],Female sterilization is a marginal contraceptive method in Burkina Faso where the overall contraceptive prevalence rate barely reaches 9%. 142 cases of tubal ligation were included in a transversal study carried out in the two major national hospitals located in Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso. The study was intended to establish the profile of acceptors and determine the indications and immediate outcomes. The women were 36 years old on average and ranged in age from 22 to 46. Virtually all were married half polygamously. 63% were Muslim 91% were housewives and 84% were illiterate. Parity ranged from 1 to 14 and averaged 7.7. The average number of living children was 5. 71% had never used contraception. 81% of those with contraceptive experience used the pill. The sterilization decision was made by the patient and her husband in 41% of the cases. The procedure was proposed by a health professional in 26%. The indications were exclusively medical in 50% and for convenience in 20%. In 11% both medical indications and convenience were factors. Only 5% cited exclusively economic reasons. 56% of the tubal ligations were performed during a cesarean and 35% in the immediate postpartum. 2 cases of abscess were reported. No pregnancies were reported in follow up of 2-14 months. Oral informed consent was obtained prior to the operation from both the woman and her husband. The authors conclude that there is some demand for female sterilization in Burkina Faso. Female sterilization should be promoted along with other contraceptive methods a national program of female sterilization should be undertaken including training of personnel and equipping of medical facilities and the legal status of the procedure should be clarified.,1997,Contraception Fertilite Sexualite
Le conseguenze sanzionatorie della violazione del principio di immediatezza nel licenziamento disciplinare,"EnglishGenerally speaking, want of immediacy in notifying a violation or giving notice of termination attests that an intrinsic element is missing with respect to the hypothetical fact situation stated under article 2119 of the civil code, thus entailing the application of article 18, subsection 5 of the Workersâ€™ Statute to medium-sized and large company employers (18, subsections 8 and 9 of the Workersâ€™ Statute). However, where circumstances exist such as to justify delay (e.g. a precautionary suspension) such consequences will not apply. In such cases, want of immediacy in notifying a violation will be merely viewed as a procedural deficiency pursuant to article 18, subsection 6 of the Workersâ€™ Statute (with regard to employers having the characteristics indicated under article 18, subsections 8 and 9 of the Workersâ€™ Statute) and the employee will have no entitlement to indemnity in lieu of notice. Delays in notifying a violation or giving notice of termination will only be sanctioned under article 18, subsection 4 of the Workersâ€™ Statute if accompanied by conduct whose tenor is wholly incompatible with the intent of dismissal (if the employer is a medium-sized or large company). A similar sanction would apply when an abnormal lapse of time between the discovery of cause of dismissal and the employerâ€™s reaction denotes that the two events are not causally linked. Immediacy is also an intrinsic requisite â€“ as can be inferred from article 2119 of the civil code â€“ for justified subjective grounds. The sanction applicable to small-company employers (without the characteristics stated under article 18, subsections 8 and 9 of the Workersâ€™ Statute) are also discussed, especially with regard to employees hired with an open-ended contract with progressively higher levels of protection. italianoNel saggio si critica lâ€™opinione che individua il fondamento del principio di immediatezza nel licenziamento disciplinare nel principio di tutela dellâ€™affidamento e si prende posizione sulle conseguenze sanzionatorie della sua violazione. Il difetto di immediatezza nella contestazione dâ€™addebito o nellâ€™intimazione del recesso attesta, di regola, il difetto di un elemento intrinseco alla fattispecie di cui allâ€™art. 2119 c.c., con conseguente applicazione â€“ nellâ€™ex area di tutela reale â€“ dellâ€™art. 18, comma 5, Stat. lav. Non cosi, ove ricorrano circostanze che giustifichino lâ€™attesa (ad esempio una sospensione cautelare). In tal caso, il difetto di immediatezza nella contestazione dâ€™addebito potra rilevare unicamente come vizio procedimentale, con applicazione dellâ€™art. 18, comma 6, Stat. lav. (nellâ€™ex area di tutela reale) ed il lavoratore non avra diritto allâ€™indennita di mancato preavviso. Lâ€™inerzia nella contestazione dâ€™addebito, o nellâ€™intimazione del licenziamento, solo se accompagnata da comportamenti concludenti, univocamente incompatibili con la volonta di recedere, potra essere sanzionata, nellâ€™ex area di tutela reale, con lâ€™applicazione dellâ€™art. 18, comma 4, Stat. lav. Analoga conseguenza sanzionatoria ricorre ove lâ€™abnorme lasso di tempo tra scoperta del fatto e la reazione del datore di lavoro denoti la mancanza del nesso causale. Lâ€™immediatezza e requisito â€“ desumibile dallâ€™art. 2119 c.c. â€“ intrinseco anche al giustificato motivo soggettivo.

Metabolomic Characterization of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis for Biomarker Discovery.,"Background: Metabolomics plays an important role in providing insight into the etiology and mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This is accomplished by a comprehensive analysis of patterns involved in metabolic alterations in human specimens. This study compares the levels of plasma metabolites in HCC cases versus cirrhotic patients and evaluates the ability of candidate metabolites in distinguishing the two groups. Also, it investigates the combined use of metabolites and clinical covariates for detection of HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis.Methods: Untargeted analysis of metabolites in plasma from 128 subjects (63 HCC cases and 65 cirrhotic controls) was conducted using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This was followed by targeted evaluation of selected metabolites. LASSO regression was used to select a set of metabolites and clinical covariates that are associated with HCC. The performance of candidate biomarkers in distinguishing HCC from cirrhosis was evaluated through a leave-one-out cross-validation based on area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve.Results: We identified 11 metabolites and three clinical covariates that differentiated HCC cases from cirrhotic controls. Combining these features in a panel for disease classification using support vector machines (SVM) yielded better area under the ROC curve compared with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).Conclusions: This study demonstrates the combination of metabolites and clinical covariates as an effective approach for early detection of HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis.Impact: Further investigation of these findings may improve understanding of HCC pathophysiology and possible implication of the metabolites in HCC prevention and diagnosis.

A survey on illegal wildlife and products trade in Yunan Province and neighboring border area,"We conducted a covert survey on illegal trade of wildlife and products in 3major cites,7classone border ports in Yunnan Province,China,and 2neighboring border cities in Burma and 1in Vietnam.We recorded a total of 46 species of animals.Nearly half(47.8%)of these species were mammals,and 41.3% were reptiles.Among those species,24 species,which accounted for 52.2% of the total species,were listed under the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Speices(CITES),and 19 species,which accounted for41.3% of the total species,were listed as state key protected wild animals.The products of pangolins(Manis pentadactyla),Asian elephants(Elephas maximus),tigers(Panthera tigris ssp.)and bears(Ursus spp.)were recorded in both domestic and foreign markets with a higher encounter frequency in foreign border cities than in Yunnan Province.In addition to animal products,trade on live animals,such as the pangolin,common water monitor(Varanus salvator)and freshwater turtles and tortoises,was also recorded.Trade on pangolins had the highest encounter frequency in the whole survey.We also found an increasing trend of trade on species of animals not included in the state key protected list.Base on the current survey,we strongly suggest the following:improve law enforcement effectiveness,strengthen capacity building,establish the market and trade monitoring system,strengthen international cooperation and increase public awareness of wildlife conservation.Once implemented these measures will help to completely stop the illegal trade of endangered species,and lead to sustainable utilization of non-protected species in Yunnan Province.",2015,Journal of Beijing Normal University
"Spore-pollen Flora as the Indicator of Paleoclimate Condition in the Yixian Formation, Western Liaoning Province","The spore-pollen flora consisting of 82 species in 62 genera and 3 species of fossil algae from the Member 2 of the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation shows the following characteristics. The coniferous bisaccate pollen ( 76.42? ?4.12%) is the dominant group in this assemblage. The pteridophytic spore ( 3.34? ?4.42%) is lower in frequency. The angiosperm pollen (0-14.74%) are quite few in amount. Bryophytes spore(0-2.88%)has only 2 species, 1 genus. The average percentages of main elements are as follows. The spores of pteridophyta (7.86%)is lower in content, including 24 species, 20 genus. Among them, Lygodiaceae genus Cicatricosisporites (3.59%)is common. Secondly, Osmundacidites( 1.16%), Deltoidospora ( 0.76%), Klukisporites( 0.59%)are frequent. Todisporites, Lycopodiumsporites, Aequitrir -adites, Lygodiumsporites cf. subsimplex, Concavissim -isporites and Leptolepidites are few and rare. The gymnospermous pollen (69.5%) include 32 genus. Among them, the dominant group is palaeoconiferous types of pollen (27.13%) such as Protoconiferus(5.22%), Protopinus(9.45%), Pseud- opicea(12.36%), Piceites(4.65%)and so on. A lot of new types of pollen (20.98%) including Pinuspolleni- tes(6.88%), Picepaepollenites(5.43%), Abietineaep- ollenites(4.5%), Podocarpidites(2.36%), Cedripites(1.92%) are present in this group. The monocolpate types (including Bennettita and Ginkgoaceae) ( 7.43%)include Ginkgoites, Cycadopites, Ginkgocyca -dophytus and Monosulciles. Cheirolepidiaceae genus Classopolliss(2.6%)are common. The other types of pollen associated with arid climate are Ephedripites( 0.41%), Gnetaceae(0.53%) and Jugella(0.84%). Besides, Perinopollenites(6.77%), Psophosphaera( 3.45%), Taxodiaceaepollenites, Jiaohepollis, Quadraculina are low in number. Early angiosperms pollen (1.83%) occur but quite rarely. They are main noncolporate types. The second are anaulcerate types and a few original tricolpape. Based on ecological characteristic, climate and humidity condition for the vegetation type of the sporo-pollen from the Yixian Fm.(Member 2), the palaeovegetation types have been reconstructed. The result shows that needle leaf element is totally about 68.75%, evergreen latifoliate element is 2.07%, defoliate latifoliate element is 7.15%, scrub are 1.47%, herbage is 7.11%. The aciculisilvae possess a highest percentage in the vegetation type. The tropic type is 9.56%, sub-tropic-warm-temperate type is 8.65%, temperate type is 71.06%, eurythermy type is 4.82%. The xerophylous element is 5.04%, mesophyta element is 86.73%, hygrophilous element is 7.72%. According to above characteristics, it is suggested that the spore-pollen flora of Yixian Fm. Member 2 lived under a humid subtropical to warm-temperate climate condition with typical aciculisilvae. Due to the defoliate latifoliate plants and xerophylous plants occuring with a certain amount in this flora, it is probable that climate condition is seasonal, xeric or semi-arid.",2004,
Risk Prediction Using Genome-Wide Association Studies on Type 2 Diabetes,"The success of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has enabled us to improve risk assessment and provide novel genetic variants for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. However, most variants discovered by GWASs have been reported to have very small effect sizes on complex human diseases, which has been a big hurdle in building risk prediction models. Recently, many statistical approaches based on penalized regression have been developed to solve the ""large p and small n"" problem. In this report, we evaluated the performance of several statistical methods for predicting a binary trait: stepwise logistic regression (SLR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Elastic-Net (EN). We first built a prediction model by combining variable selection and prediction methods for type 2 diabetes using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0 from the Korean Association Resource project. We assessed the risk prediction performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the internal and external validation datasets. In the internal validation, SLR-LASSO and SLR-EN tended to yield more accurate predictions than other combinations. During the external validation, the SLR-SLR and SLR-EN combinations achieved the highest AUC of 0.726. We propose these combinations as a potentially powerful risk prediction model for type 2 diabetes.",2016,Genomics & Informatics

Penalized Regression Methods for Linear Models in SAS/STAT,"Regression problems with many potential candidate predictor variables occur in a wide variety of scientific fields and business applications. These problems require you to perform statistical model selection to find an optimal model, one that is as simple as possible while still providing good predictive performance. Traditional stepwise selection methods, such as forward and backward selection, suffer from high variability and low prediction accuracy, especially when there are many predictor variables or correlated predictor variables (or both). In the last decade, the higher prediction accuracy and computational efficiency of penalized regression methods have made them an attractive alternative to traditional selection methods. This paper first provides a brief review of the LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and elastic net penalized model selection methods. Then it explains how to perform model selection by applying these techniques with the GLMSELECT procedure, which includes extensive customization options and powerful graphs for steering statistical model selection.",2015,
A Diagnostic Prediction Model of Acute Symptomatic Portal Vein Thrombosis.,"BACKGROUND
To develop a diagnostic prediction model to improve identification of acute symptomatic portal vein thrombosis (PVT).


METHODS
We examined 47 PVT patients and 94 control without PVT in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and Suqian People's Hospital of Nanjing, Gulou Hospital Group. We constructed a prediction model by using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier coupled with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We applied a 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the error rate for each model.


RESULTS
The present study indicated that acute symptomatic PVT was associated with 11 indicators, including liver cirrhosis, D-Dimer, splenomegaly, splenectomy, inherited thrombophilia, ascetic fluid, history of abdominal surgery, bloating, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin and abdominal tenderness. The LASSO-SVM model achieved a sensitivity of 91.5% and a specificity of 100.0%.

Texts in Statistics An Introduction to Statistical Learning,"Statistics An Intduction to Stistical Lerning with Applications in R An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the fi eld of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fi elds ranging from biology to fi nance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. Th is book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classifi cation, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fi elds, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical soft ware platform. Two of the authors co-wrote Th e Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. Th is book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. Th e text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra. Gareth James is a professor of statistics at University of Southern California. He has published an extensive body of methodological work in the domain of statistical learning with particular emphasis on high-dimensional and functional data. Th e conceptual framework for this book grew out of his MBA elective courses in this area. Daniela Witten is an assistant professor of biostatistics at University of Washington. Her research focuses largely on high-dimensional statistical machine learning. She has contributed to the translation of statistical learning techniques to the fi eld of genomics, through collaborations and as a member of the Institute of Medicine committee that led to the report Evolution of Translational Omics. Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani are professors of statistics at Stanford University, and are co-authors of the successful textbook Elements of Statistical Learning. Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title.

L1 Regularized Multiplicative Iterative Path Algorithm for Non-negative Generalized Linear Models,"In regression modeling, often a restriction that regression coefficients are non-negative is faced. The problem of model selection in non-negative generalized linear models (NNGLM) is considered using lasso, where regression coefficients in the linear predictor are subject to non-negative constraints. Thus, non-negatively constrained regression coefficient estimation is sought by maximizing the penalized likelihood (such as the l 1 -norm penalty). An efficient regularization path algorithm is proposed for generalized linear models with non-negative regression coefficients. The algorithm uses multiplicative updates which are fast and simultaneous. Asymptotic results are also developed for the constrained penalized likelihood estimates. Performance of the proposed algorithm is shown in terms of computational time, accuracy of solutions and accuracy of asymptotic standard deviations.",2016,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.

When an individual's persistence in a community depends upon the strength of competitive interactions, changes in the timing of arrival relative to the arrival of a competitor can modify competitive strength and, ultimately, establishment in the community. We investigated whether the strength of intracohort competitive interactions between recent settlers of the reef fishes Thalassoma hardwicke and T. quinquevittatum are dependent on the sequence and temporal separation of their arrival into communities. To achieve this, we manipulated the sequence and timing of arrival of each species onto experimental patch reefs by simulating settlement pulses and monitoring survival and aggressive interactions. Both species survived best in the absence of competitors, but when competitors were present, they did best when they arrived at the same time. Survival declined as each species entered the community progressively later than its competitor and as aggression by its competitor increased. Intraspecific effects of resident T. hardwicke were similar to interspecific effects. This study shows that the strength of competition depends not only on the identity of competitors, but also on the sequence and timing of their interactions, suggesting that when examining interaction strengths, it is important to identify temporal variability in the direction and magnitude of their effects. Furthermore, our findings provide empirical evidence for the importance of competitive lotteries in the maintenance of species diversity in demographically open marine systems.",2009,Ecology
Faster Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers with a Worst-case O ( 1 / n 2 ) Convergence Rate,"The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is being widely used for various convex programming models with separable structures arising in specifically many scientific computing areas. The ADMMâ€™s worst-case O(1/n) convergence rate measured by the iteration complexity has been established in the literature when its penalty parameter is a constant, where n is the iteration counter. Research on ADMMâ€™s worst-case O(1/n) convergence rate, however, is still in its infancy. In this paper, we suggest applying a rule proposed recently by Chambolle and Pock to iteratively update the penalty parameter and show that ADMM with this adaptive penalty parameter has a worst-case O(1/n) convergence rate. Without strong convexity requirement on the objective function, our assumptions on the model are mild and can be satisfied by some representative applications. We test the LASSO model and numerically verify the significant acceleration effectiveness of the faster ADMM with a worst-case O(1/n) convergence rate. Moreover, the faster ADMM is more user-favorable than the ADMM with a constant penalty parameter in senses of that it can pursue solutions with very high accuracy and that it is not sensitive to the initial value of the penalty parameter.",2016,
Model Selection for Pion Photoproduction,"Partial-wave analysis of meson and photon-induced reactions is needed to enable the comparison of many theoretical approaches to data. In both energy-dependent and independent parametrizations of partial waves, the selection of the model amplitude is crucial. Principles of the $S$-matrix are implemented to different degree in different approaches, but a many times overlooked aspect concerns the selection of undetermined coefficients and functional forms for fitting, leading to a minimal yet sufficient parametrization. We present an analysis of low-energy neutral pion photoproduction using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in combination with criteria from information theory and $K$-fold cross validation. These methods are not yet widely known in the analysis of excited hadrons but will become relevant in the era of precision spectroscopy. The principle is first illustrated with synthetic data, then, its feasibility for real data is demonstrated by analyzing the latest available measurements of differential cross sections ($d\sigma/d\Omega$), photon-beam asymmetries ($\Sigma$), and target asymmetry differential cross sections ($d\sigma_T/d\Omega$) in the low energy regime.",2016,Physical Review C
Estimation Consistency of the Group Lasso and its Applications,"We extend the `2-consistency result of (Meinshausen and Yu 2008) from the Lasso to the group Lasso. Our main theorem shows that the group Lasso achieves estimation consistency under a mild condition and an asymptotic upper bound on the number of selected variables can be obtained. As a result, we can apply the nonnegative garrote procedure to the group Lasso result to obtain an estimator which is simultaneously estimation and variable selection consistent. In particular, our setting allows both the number of groups and the number of variables per group increase and thus is applicable to high-dimensional problems. We also provide estimation consistency analysis for a version of the sparse additive models with increasing dimensions. Some finite-sample results are also reported.",2009,

Penalized Interaction Estimation for Ultrahigh Dimensional Quadratic Regression,"Quadratic regression goes beyond the linear model by simultaneously including main effects and interactions between the covariates. The problem of interaction estimation in high dimensional quadratic regression has received extensive attention in the past decade. In this article we introduce a novel method which allows us to estimate the main effects and interactions separately. Unlike existing methods for ultrahigh dimensional quadratic regressions, our proposal does not require the widely used heredity assumption. In addition, our proposed estimates have explicit formulas and obey the invariance principle at the population level. We estimate the interactions of matrix form under penalized convex loss function. The resulting estimates are shown to be consistent even when the covariate dimension is an exponential order of the sample size. We develop an efficient ADMM algorithm to implement the penalized estimation. This ADMM algorithm fully explores the cheap computational cost of matrix multiplication and is much more efficient than existing penalized methods such as all pairs LASSO. We demonstrate the promising performance of our proposal through extensive numerical studies.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
A penalized regression approach for DNA copy number study using the sequencing data.,"Modeling the high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) data, resulting from experiments with the goal of profiling tumor and control samples for the study of DNA copy number variants (CNVs), remains to be a challenge in various ways. In this application work, we provide an efficient method for detecting multiple CNVs using NGS reads ratio data. This method is based on a multiple statistical change-points model with the penalized regression approach, 1d fused LASSO, that is designed for ordered data in a one-dimensional structure. In addition, since the path algorithm traces the solution as a function of a tuning parameter, the number and locations of potential CNV region boundaries can be estimated simultaneously in an efficient way. For tuning parameter selection, we then propose a new modified Bayesian information criterion, called JMIC, and compare the proposed JMIC with three different Bayes information criteria used in the literature. Simulation results have shown the better performance of JMIC for tuning parameter selection, in comparison with the other three criterion. We applied our approach to the sequencing data of reads ratio between the breast tumor cell lines HCC1954 and its matched normal cell line BL 1954 and the results are in-line with those discovered in the literature.",2019,Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology
"Supplement to "" An Iterative Smoothing Algorithm for Regression with Structured Sparsity ""","High-dimensional prediction models are increasingly used to analyze biological data such as neuroimaging of genetic data sets. 
However, classical penalized algorithms yield to dense solutions that are difficult to interpret without arbitrary thresholding. Alternatives based on sparsity-inducing penalties suffer from coefficient instability. Complex structured sparsity-inducing penalties are a promising approach to force the solution to adhere to some domain-specific constraints and thus offering new perspectives in biomarker identification. 
We propose a generic optimization framework that can combine any smooth convex loss function with: (i) penalties whose proximal operator is known and (ii) with a 
large range of complex, non-smooth convex structured penalties such as total variation, or overlapping group lasso. 
Although many papers have addressed a similar goal, few have tackled it in such a generic way and in the context of high-dimensional data. 
The proposed continuation algorithm, called \textit{CONESTA}, dynamically smooths the complex penalties to avoid the computation of proximal operators, that are 
either not known or expensive to compute. The decreasing sequence of smoothing parameters is dynamically adapted, using the duality gap, in order to maintain the optimal convergence speed towards any globally desired precision with duality gap guarantee. 
First, we demonstrate, on both simulated data and on experimental MRI data, that CONESTA outperforms the excessive gap method, ADMM, proximal gradient smoothing (without continuation) and inexact FISTA in terms of convergence speed and/or precision of the solution. 
Second, on the experimental MRI data set, we establish the superiority of structured sparsity-inducing penalties ($\ell_1$ and total variation) over non-structured 
methods in terms of the recovery of meaningful and stable groups of predictive variables.",2016,

Microarray profiling of gene expression in the aging monkey brain,"s / Neuroscience Research 68S (2010) e223â€“e334 e305 own. We previouy reported that two types of AICD were existed. One was soluble and easily degraded form, and the other was membrane associated form. Therfore, we speculate that the accumulation of membrane associated AICD including APP C-terminal fragments may be toxic. In this study, to clear the relationship between the accumulation of AICD and toxic effects, we analzed the metabolism of AICD and the affect of AICD accumulation in cultured cells using proteomic methods. We found that APP C-terminal fragments was degraded in both gamma-secretase pathway and lysosomal pathway. On the proteomic analysis of cultured cells expressing AICDs or cultured cells with gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment, we found that nuclear-related proteins and vesicular trafficking-related proteins reduced in cultured cells expressing membrane-asscociated AICD. We will report and discuss the influence of AICDs accumulation in cultured cells. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1352 P2-n12 Generation of disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells from Alzheimerâ€™s disease patients Naoki Yahata 1 , Harushisa Inoue 1,2, Shiho Kitaoka 1,2, Kayoko Tsukita 1,2, Takayuki Kondo 3, Naohiro Egawa 1,3, Isao Asaka 1,2, Kazutoshi Takahashi 1,2, Tatsutoshi Nakahata 1, Shinobu Kawakatsu 4, Ryosuke Takahashi 3, Takashi Asada 2,5, Shinya Yamanaka 1 1 CiRA, iCeMS, Kyoto University 2 JST-CREST 3 Graduate School of Med., Kyoto University 4 Department of Psychiatry, Yamagata University School of Medicine 5 Department of Neuropsychiatry, University of Tsukuba Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system which causes progressive memory and cognitive decline during middle to late adult life. The cell death mechanisms and therapeutic intervention for AD have been tested by transgenic rodent models. However, these models not fully represent the human condition. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which show striking similarities to embryonic stem cells, can now be derived from human adult somatic tissues and have the capacity to be lineage restricted into various neuronal subtypes. Furthermore, establishment of disease-specific human cortical neurons and human cell-based AD model in vitro is crucial for investigation of the disease mechanism and drug discovery. We generated disease-specific iPS cells from patients with AD. Dermal fibroblasts from the patients were transduced with either four or three reprogramming factors, followed by emergence of putative iPS cell colonies after a few weeks. We evaluated their similarity to ES cells by checking the expression of the ES cellassociated antigens. Next, we examined the pluripotency of iPS cells by teratoma formation and embryoid body (EB) differentiation in vitro. Disease-specific iPS cells from AD patients possess properties of ES cells with patient-specific genetic information and may contribute to explore the pathogenesis of AD. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1353 P2-n13 Microarray profiling of gene expression in the aging monkey brain Sayuri Higaki 1 , Akira Sato 2, Toshio Kojima 2,3, Takao Oishi 1 1 Sect Systems Neurosci, Primate Res Inst, Kyoto Univ, Inuyama 2 Computational Systems Biol Res Group, RIKEN, Yokohama 3 Res Equipment Center, Hamamatsu Univ Sch of Med, Hamamatsu Aging of the primate proceeds slowly and is characterized by prominent senescence, i.e., prolonged survival after reproductive years. To further our understanding of the characteristic aging process of the primate brain, we conducted DNA microarray analysis of Brodmannâ€™s area 46 (A46) and hippocampus in aged monkeys, because these areas are thought to be important for the process of learning and memory. Monkeys (n = 24) were assigned into 4 groups based on age (young; mean age 10.0 and aged; mean age 26.3) and sex (female and male). RNA isolated from 48 brain tissues was applied to the 4 Ã— 44K Rhesus Monkey Oligo Microarrays (Agilent). For 1205 genes expressed differentially more than 1.5 fold between young and aged monkey hippocampus or A46, we employed GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) to evaluate whether pre-defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences. In aged female hippocampus but not male hippocampus, homeostasis-related gene sets were significantly upregulated (FDR q-value < 0.25). The hyper-expression of genes encoding chemokine and complement proteins engaged in immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory activity implies age-related inflammation or disease progression. Moreover, in aged female hippocampus and A46, gene set involved in neurological system process was significantly downregulated (FDR q-value < 0.25). The decreased expression of genes encoding neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, cortistatin, corticotropin releasing hormone and 5HT2A receptor may lead to neuronal hypofunction in these regions. On the other hand, male hippocampus and A46 did not present significant age-related differences in any gene sets. These sex differences in brain aging process may result from molecular and cellular deterioration caused by drastic change in hormonal dynamics in aged female monkeys. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1354 P2-n14 tert-Butylhydroquinone protects dopaminergic neurons from MPP+ cytotoxicity primarily via normalization of glutathione levels in midbrain slice cultures Yukie Sato , Akinori Hisatsune, Yoichiro Isohama, Hiroshi Katsuki Dept Chemico-pharmacol Sci, Grad Sch Pharm Sci, Kumamoto Univ, Kumamoto Parkinson disease is characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, which leads to severe motor deficits including tremors and inability to initiate movement. Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenic events in this neurodegenerative disorder. Under conditions of increased oxidative stress, a transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) binds to antioxidant response element to induce expression of enzymes related to phase II detoxification and antioxidative defense. Thus, promotion of recruitment of Nrf2 can be a target of neuroprotective therapy that confers resistance to a variety of oxidative stress-related insults on neurons. Here we examined the effect of tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), an activator of Nrf2, against of MPP+ cytotoxicity in rat midbrain slice cultures. Immunohistochemical examinations on tyrosine hydroxylase revealed that tBHQ (5â€“40 M) inhibited dopaminergic neuron loss induced by 48-h application of 30 M MPP+, in a concentration-dependent manner. Because Nrf2 activation leads to its translocation to the nucleus, we examined Nrf2 levels in nuclear fractions obtained from midbrain slice homogenates after drug treatment, by western blotting. tBHQ treatment increased Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus in a concentration-dependent manner, which was accelerated in the presence of MPP+. We next examined possible involvement of glutathione synthesis and heme oxygenase-1 expression, two major pathways downstream of Nrf2 activation, in the neuroprotective effect of tBHQ. We found that tBHQ significantly increased glutathione content in midbrain slices, and that depletion of glutathione by buthionine sulfoximine abolished the protective effect of tBHQ against MPP+ cytotoxicity. On the other hand, inhibition of heme oxygenase by zinc protoporphyrin IX did not suppress the protective effect of tBHQ. These results suggest that tBHQ protects midbrain dopaminergic neurons via increase in glutathione synthesis. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1355 P2-n17 Human DJ-1-specific transcriptional activation of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene Shizuma Ishikawa 1 , Takahiro Taira 2, Kazuko Takahashi-Niki 3, Takeshi Niki 1, Hiroyoshi Ariga 3, Sanae M.M.

Hokkaido University Loss-of-functional mutation in the DJ-1 gene causes a subset of familial Parkinson disease. The mechanism underlying DJ-1-related selective vulnerability in the dopaminergic pathway is, however, not resolved. DJ-1 has multiple functions, including transcriptional regulation, and one of the transcriptional target genes for DJ-1 is the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene whose product is a key enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis. It has been reported that DJ-1 is a neuroprotective transcriptional co-activator that sequesters a transcriptional co-repressor pyrimidine tract-binding protein associated splicing factor (PSF) from the TH gene promoter. In this study, we found that knockdown of human DJ-1 by small interference RNA in human dopaminergic cell lines attenuated the TH gene expression and L-DOPA production but that knockdown or knockout of mouse DJ-1 in mouse cell lines or in DJ-1 knockout mice did not affect such expression and activity of TH. Reporter assays using the human TH gene promoter linked to the luciferase gene showed that stimulation of TH promoter activity was observed in human but not mouse cells transfected with DJ-1. Although human and mouse DJ-1 were associated either with human or with mouse PSF, TH promoter activity inhibited by PSF was restored by human DJ-1 but not mouse DJ-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the complex of PSF with DJ-1 bound to the human but not mouse TH gene promoter. These results suggest a novel",2010,Neuroscience Research
Discovery and functional characterization of leptin and its receptors in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica).,"Leptin is an important endocrine regulation factor of food intake and energy homeostasis in mammals; however, the existence of a poultry leptin gene (LEP) is still debated. Here, for the first time, we report the cloning of a partial exon 3 sequence of LEP (qLEP) and four different leptin receptor splicing variants, including a long receptor (qLEPRl) and three soluble receptors (qLEPR-a, qLEPR-b and qLEPR-c) in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). The qLEP gene had high GC content (64%), which is similar to other reported avian leptin genes. The encoded qLEP protein possessed the conserved pair of cysteine residues that are required to form a lasso knot for full biological activity, but shared relatively low identities with LEPs of other vertebrates. The translated qLEPRl protein contained 1143 amino acids and shared high amino acid sequence identity with a chicken homolog (89% identity). qLEPRl also contained all the motifs, domains, and basic tyrosine residues that are conserved in the LEPRl proteins of other vertebrates. qRT-PCR analysis showed that LEP and the four LEPR variants were expressed extensively in all tissues examined; the expression levels of LEP were relatively high in hypothalamus, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, while the expression levels of the LEPRs were highest in the pituitary. Compared with the expression levels of juvenile qLEP and total qLEPR (including all LEPR variants), the expression levels of mature qLEP and total qLEPR were up-regulated in the hypothalamus and pituitary, and down-regulated in the ovary. The expressions of LEP/LEPR increased when fasting and decreased when refeeding in the brain and peripheral tissues of juvenile quail, which suggested that the LEP/LEPR system modulated food intake and energy expenditure, although, unlike in mammals, LEP may actually act to inhibit food intake during fasting, at least in juvenile quail. The results indicate that qLEP and qLEPR have unique expression patterns and that the encoded proteins play important roles in the regulation of reproduction and energy status in Japanese quail.",2016,General and comparative endocrinology

We then introduce a first kind of structure, using a hybrid model.

"Hegels Lehre vom Menschen. Kommentar zu den 387-482 der ""EnzyklopÃ¤die der Philosophischen Wissenschaften"" (review)","Hegel's analysis of the speculative sentence that provides the basis for the dialectical mode of explication he employed in the system itself, and it is the latter that constitutes his particular contribution to the enterprise of metaphysical reflection. In his essay ""Les trois lectures philosophiques de rEncyclopedie ou la realisation du concept de philosophie chez Hegel,"" Theodore F. Geraets discusses a new interpretation of the three syllogisms of the concept of philosophy, as developed in Hegel's Enzyklopi~die der philosophischen Wissenschaften im Grundrisse. He attacks as an impermissible oversimplification the interpretation of several eminent scholars--including G. Lasson, and J. van der Meulen--according to which the Enzykloptidie represents the first syllogism; the Phenomenology of Spirit, the second; and the Berlin lectures, especially those on the philosophy of religion, the third. In recent times, the Enzyklopi~die has been considered by several commentators as the third syllogism. Emil Fackenheim concludes that there is a triple mediation spread throughout Hegel's works; but Hegel seems to have given a complete systematic description of the third phase only, and this precisely in the Enzyklopi~die. This interpretation does not satisfy Geraets; nor does another, more detailed one, offered by A. Leonard. The basic content of Geraets's interpretation is developed as follows: The three syllogisms seem to express the three possible and required readings of the Enzyklopadie itself. They don' t reveal anything new, but are not limited simply to resuming and repeating what was said before: they show that a unique reading cannot fully come to grips with the contents of science--not even the third reading. In fact, the third stands for itself even less than the first or second. The two preceding readings are in no way provisional, whereas the third one cannot represent anything but the comprehension of the two first readings in their unity. This is clearly expres'sed in the edition of 1830. To this reviewer, however, the whole complicated discussion does not appear overly relevant: it remains bogged down in the purely philological area. The last original essay in this volume is devoted to the problem of Hegel's conception of space. Dieter Wandschneider (""Raumliche Extension und das Problem der Dreidimensionalit~t in Hegels Theorie des Raumes"") tries to explain the dialectic method for the philosophy of natural science, a hitherto neglected field. He concludes that when Hegel talks of a three-dimensional space the number ""three"" has only an abstract significance and has no evidence for and in itself. One cannot see why just this number should be relevant for space. The three dimensions are nothing but three general differences. The determination of the number appears as an external factor having the form of accidentalness. Seen in such a way, the dimensions are ""but directions which prove to be different, but not their unity or totality"" (see ""Jena Logic"" and ""Real Philosophy""). This opens the possibility of an abstract mathematical space which is not restricted to three dimensions. It represents but the most elementary and most original version of the principle of space. The fact that we cannot actually perceive more than three dimensions means only that even higher dimensional diversities cannot void the fact of the elementary space, because they presuppose it as their principle. Thus, Wandschneider has shown that Hegel's philosophy can be valid even for modern mathematics and physics--a quite unexpected feat.

Proximal Splitting Meets Variance Reduction,"Despite the raise to fame of stochastic variance reduced methods like SAGA and ProxSVRG, their use in non-smooth optimization is still limited to a few simple cases. Existing methods require to compute the proximal operator of the non-smooth term at each iteration, which, for complex penalties like the total variation, overlapping group lasso or trend filtering, is an iterative process that becomes unfeasible for moderately large problems.
In this work we propose and analyze VRTOS, a variance-reduced method to solve problems with an arbitrary number of non-smooth terms. Like other variance reduced methods, it only requires to evaluate one gradient per iteration and converges with a constant step size, and so is ideally suited for large scale applications.
Unlike existing variance reduced methods, it admits multiple non-smooth terms whose proximal operator only needs to be evaluated once per iteration.
We provide a convergence rate analysis for the proposed methods that achieves the same asymptotic rate as their full gradient variants and illustrate its computational advantage on 4 different large scale datasets.",2019,

Weighted lasso in graphical Gaussian modeling for large gene network estimation based on microarray data.,"We propose a statistical method based on graphical Gaussian models for estimating large gene networks from DNA microarray data. In estimating large gene networks, the number of genes is larger than the number of samples, we need to consider some restrictions for model building. We propose weighted lasso estimation for the graphical Gaussian models as a model of large gene networks. In the proposed method, the structural learning for gene networks is equivalent to the selection of the regularization parameters included in the weighted lasso estimation. We investigate this problem from a Bayes approach and derive an empirical Bayesian information criterion for choosing them. Unlike Bayesian network approach, our method can find the optimal network structure and does not require to use heuristic structural learning algorithm. We conduct Monte Carlo simulation to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also analyze Arabidopsis thaliana microarray data and estimate gene networks.",2007,Genome informatics.

Consistent Robust Regression,"We present the first efficient and provably consistent estimator for the robust regression problem. The area of robust learning and optimization has generated a significant amount of interest in the learning and statistics communities in recent years owing to its applicability in scenarios with corrupted data, as well as in handling model mis-specifications. In particular, special interest has been devoted to the fundamental problem of robust linear regression where estimators that can tolerate corruption in up to a constant fraction of the response variables are widely studied. Surprisingly however, to this date, we are not aware of a polynomial time estimator that offers a consistent estimate in the presence of dense, unbounded corruptions. In this work we present such an estimator, called CRR. This solves an open problem put forward in the work of (Bhatia et al, 2015). Our consistency analysis requires a novel two-stage proof technique involving a careful analysis of the stability of ordered lists which may be of independent interest. We show that CRR not only offers consistent estimates, but is empirically far superior to several other recently proposed algorithms for the robust regression problem, including extended Lasso and the TORRENT algorithm. In comparison, CRR offers comparable or better model recovery but with runtimes that are faster by an order of magnitude.",2017,
Controversy and human agency in 'portrait masks' from the studio of AndrÃ© Sanou,"Abstract:This article examines artist AndrÃ© Sanou's individual agency in the invention and popularity of 'portrait masks' in and around Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Rather than depicting abstract qualities of unseen natural forces, common among masks in this region, Sanou created the first portrait mask headpiece in a stylized but highly naturalistic manner, using a photograph as reference. It clearly depicted a specific human being, redefining the mask as a portrait of the deceased whom it honoured. Sanou's act gave rise to a wildly popular mask genre. However, portrait masks have aroused debate about the (im)propriety of naturalistic representation in masquerade. I argue that the features that make AndrÃ© Sanou's portrait mask genre so popular â€“ celebrating specific individuals who are visually identifiable by their physiognomic likeness â€“ are the same ones that make the genre controversial. The controversy illustrates the messy business of reconciling creative differences with societal values that individual artists, patrons, organizers, performers and audience members who serve as gatekeepers of cultural institutions maintain and at times negotiate. As the portrait mask genre demonstrates, masquerade is not necessarily a steadfast, uncompromising institution. Individuals can unsettle or disrupt accepted mask practice, even as they broaden its scope and invigorate audiences.Abstract:Cet article examine la part individuelle de l'artiste AndrÃ© Sanou dans l'invention et la popularitÃ© des Â« masques portraits Â» Ã  Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) et ses environs. En rupture avec les masques typiques de la rÃ©gion qui capturent les qualitÃ©s abstraites de forces naturelles invisibles, Sanou a crÃ©Ã© le premier tÃªte d'un masque-portrait de maniÃ¨re stylisÃ©e mais trÃ¨s naturaliste, en se servant d'une photo comme rÃ©fÃ©rence. ReprÃ©sentant clairement un Ãªtre humain spÃ©cifique, il a redÃ©fini le masque comme un portrait du dÃ©funt qu'il entend honorer. Ce faisant, Sanou a donnÃ© naissance Ã  un genre de masque immensÃ©ment populaire. Cependant, les masques-portraits ont soulevÃ© un dÃ©bat sur la convenance (ou pas) de la reprÃ©sentation naturaliste dans l'art du masque. L'auteur soutient que les caractÃ©ristiques qui rendent le genre de masque-portrait d'AndrÃ© Sanou si populaire (en honorant des personnes visuellement identifiables par leur ressemblance physionomique) sont les mÃªmes que celles qui le rendent controversÃ©. Cette controverse illustre la difficultÃ© Ã  rÃ©concilier les diffÃ©rences crÃ©atives et les valeurs sociÃ©tales qu'entretiennent (et parfois nÃ©gocient) les artistes, les mÃ©cÃ¨nes, les organisateurs et les membres du public qui servent de gardiens des institutions culturelles. Comme le dÃ©montre le genre masque-portrait, l'art du masque n'est pas nÃ©cessairement une institution rÃ©solument intransigeante. Des personnes peuvent individuellement perturber ou bouleverser une pratique admise du masque, tout en Ã©largissant sa portÃ©e et en revigorant son public.",2018,Africa: The Journal of the International African Institute
"Spores and Pollen Colour Changes and Thermal Maturation of Mid-Cretaceous Lacustrine Organic-rich Sediments in the Mamfe Basin, S.W. Cameroon","Repeated palynological analyses of samples collected from lacustrine black organic rich shales and carbonate rocks which are abound in the Mamfe Basin have consistently yielded extremely low count of palynomorphs. Geochemical analysis of the same rocks revealed very high Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content of up to 16.10wt%, whereas similar rocks elsewhere as expected, yielded high abundance and diversity of palynomorphs. Several geologic factors involved in the burial history of sedimentary rocks may account for this low sporomorphs count, however, microscopic analyses of the changes in their colour, provides a quick and relatively cheap approach by which the thermal alteration of the sediments can be reconstructed. Palynomorphs data from this and previous studies of the same sediments were compared and confirmed to be very poor in abundance however, the few recognizable species undoubtedly permitted the assignment of an Albian-Turonian age to these sediments under study. Spore-pollen colour variation (Munsell colour standards) has proven to have a positive correlation with thermal alteration hence, sediments and organic matter maturation. Using a three sporomorph group (SG) that include: (1) leiotrilete spores of the genera Cyathidites, Deltoidospora, Dictyophyllidites, Gleicheniidites, and Leiotriletes (SG-1) with sporoderm thicknesses 1.5Î¼m, respectively); (2) trilete, regulate spores of the genus Lycopodiacidites (SG-2); (3) trilete, striate spores of the genus Cicatricosisporites (SG-3); and (4) the gymnosperm-pollen taxon Classopollis torosus (SG-4). Results show here that the colour index varied from 2.5 to 5.0, indicating low to high maturity with Kerogen types I, II and III corresponding to a paloetemparature range of 60 to 140oC for an estimated stratigraphic interval of 1000 to 3000m in the Mamfe Basin.",2017,Journal of Geography and Geology
