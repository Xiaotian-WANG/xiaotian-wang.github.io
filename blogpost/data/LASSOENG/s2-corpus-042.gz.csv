"Learning to Forget: Schooling and Family Life in New Havenâ€™s Working Class, 1870-1940","This book offers an insightful view of the complex relations between home and school in the working-class immigrant Italian community of New Haven, Connecticut. Through the lenses of history, sociology, and education, Learning to Forget presents a highly readable account of cross-generational experiences during the period from 1870 to 1940, chronicling one generation's suspicions toward public education and another's need to assimilate. Through careful research Lassonde finds that not all working class parents were enthusiastic supporters of education. Not only did the time and energy spent in school restrict children's potential financial contributions to the family, but attitudes that children encountered in school often ran counter to the family's traditional values. Legally mandated education and child labor laws eventually resolved these conflicts, but not without considerable reluctance and resistance.",2005,
Shortest path analysis using partial correlations for classifying gene functions from gene expression data,"MOTIVATION
Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are a popular tool for representing gene association structures. We propose using estimated partial correlations from these models to attach lengths to the edges of the GGM, where the length of an edge is inversely related to the partial correlation between the gene pair. Graphical lasso is used to fit the GGMs and obtain partial correlations. The shortest paths between pairs of genes are found. Where terminal genes have the same biological function intermediate genes on the path are classified as having the same function. We validate the method using genes of known function using the Rosetta Compendium of yeast (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae) gene expression profiles. We also compare our results with those obtained using a graph constructed using correlations.


RESULTS
Using a partial correlation graph, we are able to classify approximately twice as many genes to the same level of accuracy as when using a correlation graph. More importantly when both methods are tuned to classify a similar number of genes, the partial correlation approach can increase the accuracy of the classifications.",2009,Bioinformatics
Radiomics nomogram for differentiating between benign and malignant soft-tissue masses of the extremities.,"BACKGROUND
Preoperative differentiation between malignant and benign tumors is important for treatment decisions.


PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS
To investigate/validate a radiomics nomogram for preoperative differentiation between malignant and benign masses.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective.


POPULATION
Imaging data of 91 patients.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
T1 -weighted images (570 msec repetition time [TR]; 17.9 msec echo time [TE], 200-400 mm field of view [FOV], 208-512â€‰Ã—â€‰208-512 matrix), fat-suppressed fast-spin-echo (FSE) T2 -weighted images (T2 WIs) (4331 msec TR; 87.9 msec TE, 200-400 mm FOV, 312â€‰Ã—â€‰312 matrix), slice thickness 4 mm, and slice spacing 1 mm.


ASSESSMENT
Fat-suppressed FSE T2 WIs were selected for extraction of features. Radiomics features were extracted from fat-suppressed T2 WIs. A radiomics signature was generated from the training dataset using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithms. Independent risk factors were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis and a radiomics nomogram was constructed. Nomogram capability was evaluated in the training dataset and validated in the validation dataset. Performance of the nomogram, radiomics signature, and clinical model were compared.


STATISTICAL TESTS
1) Independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test: for continuous variables. Fisher's exact test or Ï‡2 test: comparing categorical variables between two groups. Univariate analysis: evaluating associations between clinical/morphological characteristics and malignancy. 2) Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-logistic regression model: selection of malignancy features. 3) Significant clinical/morphological characteristics and radiomics signature were input variables for multiple logistic regression analysis. Area under the curve (AUC): evaluation of ability of the nomogram to identify malignancy. Hosmer-Lemeshow test and decision curve: evaluation and validation of nomogram results.


RESULTS
The radiomics nomogram was able to differentiate malignancy from benignity in the training and validation datasets with an AUC of 0.94. The nomogram outperformed both the radiomics signature and clinical model alone.


DATA CONCLUSION
This radiomics nomogram is a noninvasive, low-cost preoperative prediction method combining the radiomics signature and clinical model.

The Disputed Election at Langres in 1138,"Among the many disputed episcopal elections of the twelfth century, there are few that present both as many problems and as many points of interest as that at Langres in 1138. The diocese of Langres had since the time of the Carolingian emperors been among the most important in France. As early as 872 Charles the Bald, at the request of bishop Isaac, granted jointly to the cathedral of St. Mamas at Langres and to St. Stephen at Dijon the right, previously held by the local count, to coin money. In 967, the lay count was officially replaced by the bishop, although most of his rights were subinfeudated to a vidame. â€˜Par Langres,â€™ wrote Ferdinand Lot, â€˜suzeraine du Langogne, du Dijonnais et de ses annexes (Atuyer, Oscheret, Memontois), du Boulenois, du Bassigny, du Lassois, du Tonnerrois, etc., c'est-a-dire de la moitie de la Bourgogne francaise, le roi pouvait exercer, a l'occasion, une grande influence en cette region.â€™ In 1179, the bishop recovered direct control over his rights as count and became tenant-in-chief of the crown for all his lands and powers, whereas among his own vassals he numbered the duke of Burgundy and the count of Champagne. Later, between 1179 and 1356, he rose to the rank of duke and was recognized as the third ecclesiastical peer of the realm, taking precedence over his own metropolitan, the archbishop of Lyons, at the coronation of the king. Already in the first half of the twelfth century, the diocese of Langres compared in power and size to the great ecclesiastical principalities of the Holy Roman Empire. It included practically all the present bishoprics of Langres and Dijon and extended almost to the towns of Troyes and Auxerre to the north and west and beyond Dijon to the south. Within its boundaries lay not only the great old Benedictine abbeys of Beze and of St. Benigne and St. Stephen at Dijon, but also Molesme, the mother-house of Citeaux, and the newly-founded Cistercian monasteries of Clairvaux and Morimund.",1957,Tradition
The effect of the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation event on the distribution of reef-associated labrid fishes in the eastern Pacific Ocean,"We surveyed the labrid fishes of the eastern Pacific ocean at multiple sites before, during, and after the 1997â€98 ENSO event. Our observations showed that reef fish communities in general did not appear to change markedly as a result of the ENSO. Recruitment of labrids at the Galapagos Islands, Clipperton Atoll and Baja California was generally high near the end of the ENSO, indicating no negative effect on populations. Two labrid species did extend their known range during the ENSO: Stethojulis bandanensis settled onto the tip of Baja California and to the Galapagos Islands, while Thalassoma virens recruited heavily to sites along the southern Sea of Cortez in Baja California. We discuss the oceanographic conditions during the ENSO that may have promoted the range extensions. Adults of these species were present in Baja California and Galapagos 2 yrs after the end of the ENSO. Our observations raise the question why these species do not colonize these sites in normal years, given the potential for long larval durations (up to a maximum of 104 d in T. virens) and rapid long-distance transport between islands in the region (recruits of S. bandanensis spent only about 32 d in the plankton). The recent El Ninoâ€Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event of 1997â€98 is considered to be one of the most intense of the past few centuries and has had a profound effect on the marine environment of the eastern Pacific Ocean (Glynn et al., this issue). The most significant and lasting result has been widespread mortality of reef-building corals throughout the region. The effect on reef-associated fishes is less dramatic and less well-documented, yet may be important to explaining the biogeography of fishes in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The epicenter of the temperature anomalies during the ENSO is near the Galapagos Islands, where the normal cool annual upwelling cycle disappears, the thermocline deepens, and a vast region of exceptionally warm surface water develops and persists for many months (reviewed in Enfield, this issue). In addition, the eastward flowing North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) speeds up considerably, and warm tropical water builds up in the eastern Pacific and flows towards more temperate regions (Wyrtki,",2001,Bulletin of Marine Science
A Multimodal Approach to the Quantification of Kinetic Tremor in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease,"Parkinson's disease results in motor impairment that deteriorates patients' quality of life. One of the symptoms negatively interfering with daily activities is kinetic tremor which should be measured to monitor the outcome of therapy. A new instrumented method of quantification of the kinetic tremor is proposed, based on the analysis of circles drawn on a digitizing tablet by a patient. The aim of this approach is to obtain a tremor scoring equivalent to that performed by trained clinicians. Models are trained with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method to predict the tremor scores on the basis of the parameters computed from the patients' drawings. Signal parametrization is derived from both expert knowledge and the response of an artificial neural network to the raw data, thus the approach was named multimodal. The fitted models are eventually combined into model ensembles that provide aggregated scores of the kinetic tremor captured in the drawings. The method was verified with a set of clinical data acquired from 64 Parkinson's disease patients. Automated and objective quantification of the kinetic tremor with the presented approach yielded promising results, as the Pearson's correlations between the visual ratings of tremor and the model predictions ranged from 0.839 to 0.890 in the best-performing models.",2020,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)"
Necessary and Sufficient Conditions of Solution Uniqueness in l(sub 1) Minimization (Preprint),"Abstract : This paper shows that the solutions to various convex l(sub 1) minimization problems are unique if and only if a common set of conditions are satisfied. This result applies broadly to the basis pursuit model, basis pursuit denoising model, Lasso model, as well as other l(sub 1) models that either minimize f(Ax-b) or impose the constraint f(Ax-b) or = to sigma, where f is a strictly convex function. For these models, this paper proves that x* is the unique solution if and only if A(sub I) has full column rank and there exists y. This condition is previously known to be sufficient for the basis pursuit model to have a unique solution supported on I. Indeed, it is also necessary, and applies to a variety of other l(sub 1) models. The paper also discusses ways to recognize unique solutions and verify the uniqueness conditions numerically.",2012,
Now You See Me: High School Dropout and Machine Learning,"In this paper, we create an algorithm to predict which students are eventually going to drop out of US high school using information available in 9th grade. We show that using a naive model - as implemented in many schools - leads to poor predictions. In addition to this, we explain how schools can obtain more precise predictions by exploiting the big data available to them, as well as more sophisticated quantitative techniques. We also compare the performances of econometric techniques like Logistic Regression with Machine Learning tools such as Support Vector Machine, Boosting and LASSO. We offer practical advice on how to apply the new Machine Learning codes available in Stata to the high dimensional datasets available in education. Model parameters are calibrated by taking into account policy goals and budget constraints.",2017,
Palynostratigraphy of Jurrasic to Lower Cretaceous sequences from the Eastern Desert of Egypt,"Abstract Well-preserved miospore assemblages are described from three deep exploration wells in the northern part of the Eastern Desert, Egypt. The composite succession in the three boreholes investigated comprises eight formations assigned to the Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous. The Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary in the subsurface of the studied area is unconformable. A stratigraphical break of varying magnitude exists in the three wells. Miospore analysis of the studied wells yielded about 186 miospore species belonging to 80 genera. Among these, 116 pteridophytic spore species are related to 53 genera, 39 gymnosperm pollen species to 15 genera and 31 angiosperm pollen species to 12 genera. Accordingly, six miospore biozones are recognised, three in the Jurassic and three in the Lower Cretaceous. In ascending stratigraphical order, these are: Classopollis/Circulina-Deltoidospora spp. Assemblage Zone (?Toarcian-Aalenian); Verrucosisporites spp.- Converrucosisporites spp.- Trilobosporites spp. Assemblage Zone (Early Bajocian-Callovian); Cicatricosisporites spp.- Contignisporites spp. Assemblage Zone (Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian); Stellatopollis spp.-? Schrankipollis spp. Assemblage Zone (Barremian); Afropollis operculatus-Brenneripollis-Tricolpites spp. Assemblage Zone (Aptian); and Crybelosporites pannuceus-Afropollis jardinus-Tricolporopollenites Assemblage Zone (Early Albian). These biozones are compared with other contemporaneous microfloral assemblages from the Northern Gondwanan Realm.",2001,Journal of African Earth Sciences

Robust object tracking using least absolute deviation,"Recently, sparse representation has been applied to object tracking, where each candidate target is approximately represented as a sparse linear combination of target templates. In this paper, we present a new tracking algorithm, which is faster and more robust than other tracking algorithms, based on sparse representation. First, with an analysis of many typical tracking examples with various degrees of corruption, we model the corruption as a Laplacian distribution. Then, a LAD-Lasso optimisation model is proposed based on Bayesian Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation theory. Compared with L1 Tracker and APG-L1 Tracker, the number of optimisation variables is reduced greatly; it is equal to the number of target templates, regardless of the dimensions of the feature. Finally, we use the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the proposed optimisation problem. Experiments on some challenging sequences demonstrate that our proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Display Omitted The representation error is modelled as a Laplacian distribution.We derive our new LAD-Lasso model based on a Bayesian MAP estimate.LAD-Lasso model is robust to outliers.The number of optimisation variable in the new model reduces greatly.We use ADMM algorithm to solve the new optimisation problem.",2014,Image Vis.

Palynological investigation in the lower jurassic of the vicentinian alps (Northeastern Italy),"Abstract The present paper emphasizes the applicability of palynological data as an aid to the solution of the problems related to the correlation of non-ammonitiferous Liassic strata in the Southern Alps with the ammonoid-based standard stages as recognized in the outer-Alpine part of Europe. In the Noriglio Grey Limestone Formation of the Vicentinian Alps, northeastern Italy, rich and well-preserved Liassic palynological assemblages can be abundantly found in the marly intercalations of its upper part; in the lower part palynological assemblages have appeared to be very rare. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of the assemblages has indicated the presence of a single palynological assemblage zone. Minor compositional differences do not warrant a zonal subdivision. The overall composition of the assemblages is characterized by the general dominance of Circulina and smooth trilete spores in combination with a large amount of relatively rarely occurring forms of spores, pollen grains and other acid-resistant microfossils. Because of the presence of rich and well-preserved material, it has been possible to detect a relatively wide range of variability within species of Tigrisporites, Foveosporites, Porcellispora and Crassosphaera . Among the forms which could not be matched with previously described taxa the new formgenus Skarbysporites is formally erected together with the new species Skarbysporites elsendoornii, Skarbysporites puntii, Foveosporites visscheri and Tigrisporites jonkeri . Moreover, an emended diagnosis of Circulina is proposed, implicating the assignment to this formgenus of most forms generally included in Classo pollis . Also the generic diagnosis of Tigrisporites is emended. An evaluation of the Liassic palynological assemblages from the outer-Alpine part of Europe with special reference to their potential in characterizing the ammonoid-based chronostratigraphical subdivisions may indicate that two temporal subdivisions of the Liassic Series on the basis of palynological characteristics are now slowly becoming discernable: an assemblage zone characterizing the Hettangian, Sinemurian and Lower Pliensbachian, and an assemblage zone characterizing the Upper Pliensbachian and Toarcian. Because of the possibility of a correlation with the latter zone, the assemblages from the Noriglio Grey Limestone Formation can be reasonably regarded to be indicative of a Late Pliensbachianâ€”Toarchian age of the source-strata. When considering the ammonoid evidence from the overlying â€œCape San Vigilio Ooliteâ€ it may be concluded that the upper part of the lower subdivision of the Noriglio Grey Limestone Formation and the Rotzo Member represent the Upper Pliensbachianâ€”Lower Toarcian. Because of its potential in correlating non-ammonitiferous strata from the Southern Alps with the successions in northwestern Europe, it is believed that palynology may earn a prominent place in regional Liassic chronostratigraphy.",1977,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
General rules of fragmentation evidencing lasso structures in CID and ETD,"Lasso peptides constitute a structurally unique class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) characterized by a mechanically interlocked structure in which the C-terminal tail of the peptide is threaded and trapped within an N-terminal macrolactam ring. Tandem mass spectrometry using collision induced dissociation (CID) and electron capture dissociation (ECD) have shown previously different fragmentation patterns for capistruin, microcin J25 and their corresponding branched-cyclic forms in which the C-terminal tail is unthreaded. In order to develop general rules that unambiguously discriminate the lasso and branched-cyclic topologies, this report presents experimental evidence for a set of twenty-one lasso peptides analyzed by CID and electron transfer dissociation (ETD). CID experiments on lasso peptides specifically yielded mechanically interlocked species with associated bi and yj fragments. For class II lasso peptides, these lasso-specific fragments were observed only for peptides in which the loop, located above the macrolactam ring, was strictly longer than four amino acid residues. For class I and III lasso peptides, part of the C-terminal tail remains covalently linked to the macrolactam ring by disulfide bonds; associated bi and yj fragments therefore do not clearly constitute a signature of the lasso topology. ETD experiments of lasso peptides showed a significant increase of hydrogen migration events in the loop region when compared to their branched-cyclic topoisomers, leading to the formation of specific ciË™/zâ€²j fragments for all lasso peptides, regardless of their class and loop size. Our experiments enabled us to establish general rules for obtaining structural details from CID and ETD fragmentation patterns, obviating the need for structure determination by NMR or X-ray crystallography.",2018,Analyst
Opisthobranchia ) : relationship and feeding deterrence to a potential predator on the south-western Mediterranean coast Abstract The relationship between the sacoglossan Elysia timida and the ornate wrasse,"The relationship between the sacoglossan Elysia timida and the ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo was studied in two laboratory experiments using artificial models. A feeding-preference experiment was conducted to determine whether mollusc extract deterred feeding by T. pavo, by using a â€˜â€˜realisticâ€™â€™ mollusc model (imitating the colour pattern of E. timida) coated with mollusc extract, and a reference model (without imitation or extract), and fishes collected from two locations. It was observed that fish approached, attacked and ate more reference models than mollusc models. A second feeding-preference experiment was designed with four different coloured models: â€˜â€˜realisticâ€™â€™ (W), green (G), red (R) and chequered (S) pattern. Both fish populations clearly rejected the S model, and differed in their colour preferences. Although both populations seemed to prefer the R and G models equally, the W model was clearly rejected by the fish that coexist with the mollusc at one site (MazarrÃ³n), but was not rejected by the other population of fish which does not coexist with it (Cabo de Palos). MazarrÃ³n fishes would identify the W model with the presence of a toxic compound during their coexistence, and therefore avoid attacking conspicuously coloured E. timida models as a response to their visual signals. Therefore, it was concluded that extract of E. timida is a deterrent for T. pavo, and its effect is sufficiently noxious that the fish tend to avoid it, so that the ability of the fishes to learn to recognise colours and identify certain colour patterns associated with obnoxious prey provides the molluscs the opportunity to survive by exhibiting a conspicuous coloration.",2002,
"Legacy of the American West: Indian Cowboys, Black Cowboys, and Vaqueros","Oh, I'm a lonely cowboy and I'm off the Texas trail, My trade is cinchin' saddles and pullin' bridle reins. For I can twist a lasso with the greatest skill and ease, Or rope and ride a bronco most anywhere I please. --""Lone Star Trail,"" recorded by Ken Maynard, 1930. The cowboy is viewed as an American icon: rider of the open range, rugged individual, and champion of good. Many young children pretend to be cowboys, riding stick ponies and shooting ""bad guys."" When I was growing up, Western shows peppered the television screen: Bonanza, Have Gun Will Travel, Stagecoach West, Rifleman, High Chapparell, Lone Ranger, Gunsmoke, and Johnny Ringo. Authors, such as Louis L'Amour and Zane Grey, have documented the life of a cowboy through more than 200 stories. Recordings by singing cowboys Roy Rogers and Gene Autry were a part of my early music collection. But the cowboy life was not an easy life. Beans, bacon, and coffee were the leading sustenance, a bedroll under the stars served as home most days, and pay was about $30 per month. (1) The work was tough. Cowboys faced cattle rustlers, stampedes, Indian raids, and hostile white settlers. They had to make sure the herd had plenty to eat and drink, and often had to drive cattle hundreds of miles to the nearest railroad. Cowboys are still very much a part of American culture today. High school and college students participate in rodeos sponsored by the National High School Rodeo Association and the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association. The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association sanctions around 700 rodeos annually. Why is it important to study cowboys? The introduction of cattle and horses by the Spanish conquistadors transformed the local culture, influenced the economics of the times, and created a national identity with the cowboy. Yet our understanding of cowboys has, for the most part, been informed by movies and television shows. Dime store novels and Wild West shows helped construct the stereotypical images of the ""white"" cowboy and the red-skinned ""savages."" However, the cowboy culture and history are a product of men and women of many ethnicities; therefore, it is imperative that students be exposed to the many influences that shaped the American cowboy. When Indians were Cowboys As the West was often portrayed as a battlefield between cowboys and Indians, it may be difficult for students to understand that so-called Indians were often cowboys. The early Spanish missionaries trained Native Americans as cattle herders. Many Natives adopted ranching into their economies. (2) As Native Americans had historically worked with animals and lived in close relation to the natural world, ranching provided connections to that heritage. (3) Natives were recognized for their horseback riding skills, particularly Comanche warriors, noted for their ability to shoot arrows from under a horse's neck while galloping onwards. (4) Since laws of the day made it necessary to register cattle brands, annual roundups were held. Branding cattle, riding horses, and roping skills were a natural part of the cowboy existence and often led to competitions for bragging rights as to who was the best. The rodeo was a natural extension of activities that were a fundamental part of the cowboy life. In a rodeo, the Native was not locked in the stereotype of primitive savage, but could be established as a skillful horseman or roper. Some noted Native cowboys include: 1. Jackson Sundown (Nez Perce), winner of the World Championship Rodeo in 1916; 2. Torn Three Persons (Blood), winner of the first World Bucking Horse Championship at the Calgary Stampede in 1912; 3. Will Rogers (Cherokee), noted writer and actor who grew up as a cowboy; 4. Teesquantee Woolman (Cherokee), three times National Finals Rodeo (NFR) Team Roping World Champion; 5. Tom Reeves (Sioux), team captain for U. â€¦",2008,
"Contribution of 30 biomarkers to 10-year cardiovascular risk estimation in 2 population cohorts: the MONICA, risk, genetics, archiving, and monograph (MORGAM) biomarker project.","BACKGROUND
Cardiovascular risk estimation by novel biomarkers needs assessment in disease-free population cohorts, followed up for incident cardiovascular events, assaying the serum and plasma archived at baseline. We report results from 2 cohorts in such a continuing study.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Thirty novel biomarkers from different pathophysiological pathways were evaluated in 7915 men and women of the FINRISK97 population cohort with 538 incident cardiovascular events at 10 years (fatal or nonfatal coronary or stroke events), from which a biomarker score was developed and then validated in the 2551 men of the Belfast Prospective Epidemiological Study of Myocardial Infarction (PRIME) cohort (260 events). No single biomarker consistently improved risk estimation in FINRISK97 men and FINRISK97 women and the Belfast PRIME Men cohort after allowing for confounding factors; however, the strongest associations (with hazard ratio per SD in FINRISK97 men) were found for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1.23), C-reactive protein (1.23), B-type natriuretic peptide (1.19), and sensitive troponin I (1.18). A biomarker score was developed from the FINRISK97 cohort with the use of regression coefficients and lasso methods, with selection of troponin I, C-reactive protein, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Adding this score to a conventional risk factor model in the Belfast PRIME Men cohort validated it by improved c-statistics (P=0.004) and integrated discrimination (P<0.0001) and led to significant reclassification of individuals into risk categories (P=0.0008).


CONCLUSIONS
The addition of a biomarker score including N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, and sensitive troponin I to a conventional risk model improved 10-year risk estimation for cardiovascular events in 2 middle-aged European populations. Further validation is needed in other populations and age groups.",2010,Circulation
"[High performance athlete's heart: Results of a cross-sectional survey conducted in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso].","PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
To describe the clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic features of the athlete's heart.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
This was a cross-sectional study conducted from August 2015 to February 2016 in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso. Athletes of high level of training (at least 8hours of weekly training, for more than six months regardless of the type of sport) have benefited from: a clinical examination, an electrocardiography and a cardiac ultrasound rest to look for electrical, morphological and functional cardiac changes.


RESULTS
The 192 athletes with an athlete heart included had a median age of 24 years (IQI: 21-27). The median seniority in high performance sport was 6 years (IQI: 4-8) and 10hours weekly training sessions (IQI: 10-10). The consumption of tobacco, alcohol, tea/coffee, medicines and/or energy drinks was reported respectively in 4.2%, 7.3%, 99.0%, 53.4%. A history of exertional discomfort was reported by 4.7 athletes. Electrical modifications were present in 92.1%. Sinus bradycardia was the most common abnormality (75.0% of cases). The prevalence of left atrium dilatation and left ventricular dilation was 72.4 and 22.4%, respectively. That of left ventricular hypertrophy was 9.0%.


CONCLUSION
In the high-performance athlete, the prevalence of electrical, morphological and functional changes was high. These need to be known by practitioners to differentiate them from cardiac pathology.",2019,Annales de cardiologie et d'angeiologie
Comparison of variable selection methods for PLS-based soft sensor modeling,"Abstract Data-driven soft sensors have been widely used in both academic research and industrial applications for predicting hard-to-measure variables or replacing physical sensors to reduce cost. It has been shown that the performance of these data-driven soft sensors could be greatly improved by selecting only the vital variables that strongly affect the primary variables, rather than using all the available process variables. In this work, a comprehensive evaluation of different variable selection methods for PLS-based soft sensor development is presented, and a new metric is proposed to assess the performance of different variable selection methods. The following seven variable selection methods are compared: stepwise regression (SR), partial least squares with regression coefficients (PLS-BETA), PLS with variable importance in projection (PLS-VIP), uninformative variable elimination with PLS (UVE-PLS), genetic algorithm with PLS (GA-PLS), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling with PLS (CARS-PLS). Their strengths and limitations for soft sensor development are demonstrated by a simulated case study and an industrial case study.",2015,Journal of Process Control
The Spike-and-Slab Lasso Generalized Linear Models for Prediction and Associated Genes Detection.,"Large-scale ""omics"" data have been increasingly used as an important resource for prognostic prediction of diseases and detection of associated genes. However, there are considerable challenges in analyzing high-dimensional molecular data, including the large number of potential molecular predictors, limited number of samples, and small effect of each predictor. We propose new Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear models, called spike-and-slab lasso GLMs, for prognostic prediction and detection of associated genes using large-scale molecular data. The proposed model employs a spike-and-slab mixture double-exponential prior for coefficients that can induce weak shrinkage on large coefficients, and strong shrinkage on irrelevant coefficients. We have developed a fast and stable algorithm to fit large-scale hierarchal GLMs by incorporating expectation-maximization (EM) steps into the fast cyclic coordinate descent algorithm. The proposed approach integrates nice features of two popular methods, i.e., penalized lasso and Bayesian spike-and-slab variable selection. The performance of the proposed method is assessed via extensive simulation studies. The results show that the proposed approach can provide not only more accurate estimates of the parameters, but also better prediction. We demonstrate the proposed procedure on two cancer data sets: a well-known breast cancer data set consisting of 295 tumors, and expression data of 4919 genes; and the ovarian cancer data set from TCGA with 362 tumors, and expression data of 5336 genes. Our analyses show that the proposed procedure can generate powerful models for predicting outcomes and detecting associated genes. The methods have been implemented in a freely available R package BhGLM (http://www.ssg.uab.edu/bhglm/).",2017,Genetics
QSAR analysis of Multimodal Antidepressants Vortioxetine Analogs using Physicochemical Descriptors and MLR Modeling.,"BACKGROUND
Vortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressant drug with combined effects on SERT as inhibitor, 5-HT1A as agonist and 5-HT3A as antagonist. Series of vortioxetine analogs have been reported as multi antidepressant compounds and they block serotonin transport into the neuronal cells, activate the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors and eliminate the low activity of 5-HT3A receptors.


OBJECTIVE
To explore the important properties of vortioxetine analogs involved in antidepressant activity by developing 2D QSAR models.


METHODS
Selections of significant descriptors were performed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and, the multiple linear regression (MLR) method and All Subsets and GA algorithm included in QSARINS software were used for generating QSAR models. Further, the virtual screening was performed based on bioactivity and structure similarity using the PubChem database.


RESULTS
The four descriptor model of complementary information content (CIC2), solubility (bcutp3), mass (bcutm8) and partial charge in van der Waals surface area (PEOEVSA7) of the molecules is obtained for SERT inhibition with the significant statistics of R2= 0.69, RMSEtr= 0.44, R2ext= 0.62 and CCCext= 0.78. For 5-HT1A agonist, the two descriptor model of molecular shape (Kappm3) and van der Waals volume of the atoms (bcutv11) with R2= 0.78, RMSEtr= 0.33, R2ext = 0.83, and CCCext= 0.87 is established. The three descriptor model of information content (IC3), solubility (bcutp9) and electronegativity (GATSe5) of the molecules with R2= 0.61, RMSEtr= 0.34, R2ext= 0.69 and CCCext= 0.72 is obtained for 5-HT3A antagonist. The antidepressant activities of 16 virtual screened compounds were predicted using the developed models.


CONCLUSIONS
The developed QSAR models may be useful to predict antidepressant activity for the newly synthesized vortioxetine analogs.",2018,Current computer-aided drug design
Complete isolation of left atrium surrounding the pulmonary veins: new insights from the double-Lasso technique in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.,"BACKGROUND
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) can be eliminated with continuous circular lesions (CCLs) around the pulmonary veins (PVs), but it is unclear whether all PVs are completely isolated.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Forty-one patients with symptomatic PAF underwent 3D mapping, and all PV ostia were marked on the 3D map based on venography. Irrigated radiofrequency energy was applied at a distance from the PV ostia guided by 2 Lasso catheters placed within the ipsilateral superior and inferior PVs. The mean radiofrequency duration was 1550+/-511 seconds for left-sided PVs and 1512+/-506 seconds for right-sided PVs. After isolation, automatic activity was observed in the right-sided PVs in 87.8% and in the left-sided PVs in 80.5%. During the procedure, a spontaneous or induced PV tachycardia (PVT) with a cycle length of 189+/-29 ms was observed in 19 patients. During a mean follow-up of 6 months, atrial tachyarrhythmias recurred in 10 patients. Nine patients underwent a repeat procedure. Conduction gaps in the left CCL in 9 patients and in the right CCL in 2 patients were closed during the second procedure. A spontaneous PVT with a cycle length of 212+/-44 ms was demonstrated in 7 of 9 patients, even though no PVT had been observed in 6 of these 7 patients during the first procedure. No AF recurred in 39 patients after PV isolation during follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
Automatic activity and fast tachycardia within the PVs could reflect an arrhythmogenic substrate in patients with PAF, which could be eliminated by isolating all PVs with CCLs guided by 3D mapping and the double-Lasso technique in the majority of patients.",2004,Circulation
Evolutionarily Significant Units of Rare Pygmy Sunfishes (Genus Elassoma),"Abstract Mitochondrial and nuclear gene variation is described from populations representing the range of two species of rare pygmy sunfishes, Elassoma boehlkei and Elassoma okatie, in the Carolinas. Mitochondrial control region sequences provide evidence for a minimum of four Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESU), two each within E. boehlkei and E. okatie. Significant allele frequency differences at a single nuclear gene locus corroborate the distinctiveness of these ESUs. Phylogenies based on control region haplotypes and frequencies of nuclear alleles are inconsistent with the currently described range of E. boehlkei and E. okatie. Despite inconsistency with described species boundaries, the result of this genetic analysis for rare species management is clear: conservation strategies that describe distinct population segments inhabiting individual river systems should be encouraged.",2001,Copeia

Analyzing Facebook Activities for Personality Recognition,"Facebook is the largest and the most popular online social network application that records large amount of usersâ€™ behavior expressed in various activities such as Facebook likes, status updates, posts, comments, photos, tags and shares. One of the major attractions of such a dataset relates to the predictability of the individualsâ€™ psychological traits from their digital footprints. Such predictions help researchers and service providers to improve personalized offering of products and services. The goal of this work is to investigate the predictability of Facebook usersâ€™ personality traits, measured by BIG5 test as a function of their digital records of behavior such as Facebook likes. This research is based on a dataset of 92,255 users who provided their Facebook likes and the results of their BIG5 personality test. As the Facebook likes data includes 600 attributes, the proposed model uses LASSO algorithm to select the best features and to predict Facebook usersâ€™ BIG5 personality traits. The best accuracy level of these predictions is achieved for Openness and Extraversion, the lowest accuracy level is obtained for Agreeableness while the accuracy levels of Conscientiousness and Neuroticism are in the middle.",2017,

It then shows which individual variables have the highest explanatory power. In contrast to many other studies, the study recognizes the problem of multicollinearity between predictors in regression analysis and uses Lasso regression to address this issue.",2016,Applied Energy
Acceleration Methods for Classic Convex Optimization Algorithms,"Most Machine Learning models are defined in terms of a convex optimization problem. Thus, developing algorithms to quickly solve such problems its of great interest to the field. We focus in this thesis on two of the most widely used models, the Lasso and Support Vector Machines. The former belongs to the family of regularization methods, and it was introduced in 1996 to perform both variable selection and regression at the same time. This is accomplished by adding a l1-regularization term to the least squares model, achieving interpretability and also a good generalization error. Support Vector Machines were originally formulated to solve a classification problem by finding the maximum-margin hyperplane, that is, the hyperplane which separates two sets of points and its at equal distance from both of them. SVMs were later extended to handle non-separable classes and non-linear classification problems, applying the kernel-trick. A first contribution of this work is to carefully analyze all the existing algorithms to solve both problems, describing not only the theory behind them but also pointing out possible advantages and disadvantages of each one. Although the Lasso and SVMs solve very different problems, we show in this thesis that they are both equivalent. Following a recent result by Jaggi, given an instance of one model we can construct an instance of the other having the same solution, and vice versa. This equivalence allows us to translate theoretical and practical results, such as algorithms, from one field to the other, that have been otherwise being developed independently. We will give in this thesis not only the theoretical result but also a practical application, that consists on solving the Lasso problem using the SMO algorithm, the state-of-the-art solver for non-linear SVMs. We also perform experiments comparing SMO to GLMNet, one of the most popular solvers for the Lasso. The results obtained show that SMO is competitive with GLMNet, and sometimes even faster. Furthermore, motivated by a recent trend where classical optimization methods are being re-discovered in improved forms and successfully applied to many problems, we have also analyzed two classical momentum-based methods: the Heavy Ball algorithm, introduced by Polyak in 1963 and Nesterovâ€™s Accelerated Gradient, discovered by Nesterov in 1983. In this thesis we develop practical versions of Conjugate Gradient, which is essentially equivalent to the Heavy Ball method, and Nesterovâ€™s Acceleration for the SMO algorithm. Experiments comparing the convergence of all the methods are also carried out. The results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve a faster convergence both in terms of iterations and execution time.",2017,
The development and validation of a CT-based radiomics signature for the preoperative discrimination of stage I-II and stage III-IV colorectal cancer,"OBJECTIVES
To investigative the predictive ability of radiomics signature for preoperative staging (I-IIvs.III-IV) of primary colorectal cancer (CRC).


METHODS
This study consisted of 494 consecutive patients (training dataset: n=286; validation cohort, n=208) with stage I-IV CRC. A radiomics signature was generated using LASSO logistic regression model. Association between radiomics signature and CRC staging was explored. The classification performance of the radiomics signature was explored with respect to the receiver operating characteristics(ROC) curve.


RESULTS
The 16-feature-based radiomics signature was an independent predictor for staging of CRC, which could successfully categorize CRC into stage I-II and III-IV (p <0.0001) in training and validation dataset. The median of radiomics signature of stage III-IV was higher than stage I-II in the training and validation dataset. As for the classification performance of the radiomics signature in CRC staging, the AUC was 0.792(95%CI:0.741-0.853) with sensitivity of 0.629 and specificity of 0.874. The signature in the validation dataset obtained an AUC of 0.708(95%CI:0.698-0.718) with sensitivity of 0.611 and specificity of 0.680.


CONCLUSIONS
A radiomics signature was developed and validated to be a significant predictor for discrimination of stage I-II from III-IV CRC, which may serve as a complementary tool for the preoperative tumor staging in CRC.",2016,Oncotarget
"Winogradskyella ulvae sp. nov., an epiphyte of a Pacific seaweed, and emended descriptions of the genus Winogradskyella and Winogradskyella thalassocola, Winogradskyella echinorum, Winogradskyella exilis and Winogradskyella eximia.","A Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, slightly halophilic bacterium that was motile by gliding, designated KMM 6390(T), was isolated from the coastal green alga Ulva fenestrata collected from the Sea of Japan. A comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain KMM 6390(T) was a member of the genus Winogradskyella, with Winogradskyella echinorum KMM 6211(T) as its closest relative (97.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between the isolate and other members of the genus Winogradskyella were 95.4-96.7%. DNA-DNA relatedness between the isolate and W. echinorum KMM 6211(T) was 27%. Strain KMM 6390(T) was able to grow with 0.5-4.0% NaCl and at 4-37 Â°C. The isolate decomposed casein, gelatin, starch and DNA and produced acid from galactose, D-glucose, lactose and maltose. The major fatty acids were iso-C(15:0), iso-C(15:1), anteiso-C(15:0) and C(15:0). The polar lipid profile comprised phosphatidylethanolamine and two unknown aminolipids. The DNA G+C content was 34.2 mol%. On the basis of phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic investigations, strain KMM 6390(T) represents a novel species of the genus Winogradskyella, for which the name Winogradskyella ulvae sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is KMM 6390(T) (=KCTC 23626(T)=LMG 26444(T)).

Towards the study of least squares Estimators with convex penalty,"Penalized least squares estimation is a popular technique in high-dimensional statistics. It includes such methods as the LASSO, the group LASSO, and the nuclear norm penalized least squares. The existing theory of these methods is not fully satisfying since it allows one to prove oracle inequalities with fixed high probability only for the estimators depending on this probability. Furthermore, the control of compatibility factors appearing in the oracle bounds is often not explicit. Some very recent developments suggest that the theory of oracle inequalities can be revised in an improved way. In this paper, we provide an overview of ideas and tools leading to such an improved theory. We show that, along with overcoming the disadvantages mentioned above, the methodology extends to the hilbertian framework and it applies to a large class of convex penalties. This paper is partly expository. In particular, we provide adapted proofs of some results from other recent work.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory
DÃ©terminants de la consommation des produits laitiers Ã  Bobo-Dioulasso au Burkina Faso : facteurs sociaux et sensibilitÃ© aux prix,"Faced with the competition of imported products, the characteristics and main determinants of the consumption of milk and dairy products were examined in Bobo-Dioulasso, the second consumption pole in Burkina Faso. The study included 250 consumers selected according to the quota method. The consumption of dairy products depended on socio-cultural as well as on economic factors. It was firstly influenced by the age, but also by the consumersâ€™ marital status and ethnic origin. People originating from ethnic groups in the north of the country consumed more milk than those originating from ethnic groups in the south. Consumersâ€™ purchases were influenced by the product hygiene (27%), price (23%), taste (18%), availability (11%), packaging (10%), easiness of use (7%) and easiness of conservation (6%). The analysis of the price influence revealed a range of â€œacceptableâ€ prices between 360 and 480 FCFA per liter of pasteurized milk, and 500 and 800 FCFA per kilogram of yoghurt, which indicated a good level of competitiveness within the local dairy industry. Yoghurt and pasteurized milk production seemed particularly dynamic.",2007,Revue d'eÌlevage et de meÌdecine veÌteÌrinaire des pays tropicaux
â„“q-Norm Sample-Adaptive Multiple Kernel Learning,"Existing multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithms indiscriminately apply the same set of kernel combination weights to all samples by pre-specifying a group of base kernels. Sample-adaptive MKL learning (SAMKL) overcomes this limitation by adaptively switching on/off the base kernels with respect to each sample. However, it restricts to solving MKL problems with pre-specified kernels. And, the formulation of existing SAMKL falls to an <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm MKL which is not flexible. To allow for robust kernel mixtures that generalize well in practical applications, we extend SAMKL to the arbitrary norm and apply it to image classification. In this paper, we formulate a closed-form solution for optimizing the kernel weights based on the equivalence between group-lasso and MKL, and derive an efficient <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _{q}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$q\geq 1$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and denoting the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _{q}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm of kernel weights) SAMKL algorithm.

Single-incision pediatric endosurgical epigastric hernia repair,"PurposeEpigastric hernias represent about 4Â % of all abdominal hernias in children and require surgical repair. Traditionally, these hernias are repaired by an open surgical technique. More recently, laparoscopic epigastric hernia repairs have been described using two trocars in the upper abdomen. In this paper, we describe a novel single-incision pediatric endosurgical (SIPES) technique.MethodsPatients with symptomatic epigastric hernias that were deemed to be too far superior to be repaired with an open technique through an umbilical incision were selected for SIPES repair. Two trocars (5 and 3Â mm) were introduced through a single umbilical incision and the hernia repair was performed using looped 4-0 polypropylene sutures introduced through a 17-gage spinal needle in a lasso technique.ResultsFive girls (age 4.4â€“12.6, median 6.4Â years) underwent single-incision endosurgical epigastric hernia repair. The mean operative time was 25Â Â±Â 6Â min, and there were no intraoperative complications. All patients were discharged home from the recovery room on the day of surgery. All patients were followed up 2â€“3Â weeks after the operation, with no recurrence and excellent cosmetic results.ConclusionsThe described SIPES technique offers a virtually scarless, quick, and simple option for the repair of symptomatic epigastric hernias that can be performed with standard laparoscopic equipment.",2014,Hernia
Tectonic types of oceanic abyssal basins and related potentially economic fields of ferromanganese nodules,"Tectonic typification of the abyssal basins of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans is proposed. Six types of basins are recognized: perispreading, pericontinental, central thalassogenic, intermontane abyssal, interfault, and thalassosyneclise. The tectonic diversity of the basins and their systems reflects significant regional tectono-geodynamic features of the oceanic lithosphere. Basins of the first type are inherent to the Atlantic Ocean; of the second and third types, to the Indian Ocean; and of the fourth to sixth types, to the Pacific. In the Atlantic Ocean, the basins are spatially and paragenetically conjugated with the mid-oceanic ridge. Beyond the Atlantic, a similar situation is characteristic of the southern Indian Ocean only. Hence, differentiated energetic models of deep geospheres are required. The relations of potentially economic fields of ferromanganese nodules to tectonic types of abyssal basins are discussed. The largest fields with respect to both dimensions and reserves are confined to interfault and intermontane abyssal basins. The fields localized in central thalassogenic basins are second in importance. The perispreading and pericontinental basins are the least promising in this respect. Along with other criteria, tectonic analysis should be taken into consideration in the future development of these valuable mineral resources.",2008,Geotectonics
Variables that influence basic prosthetic mobility in people with non-vascular lower limb amputation.,"BACKGROUND
There exists a dearth of evidence on rehabilitation factors that influence prosthetic mobility in people with lower limb amputation (LLA). Examining variables that contribute to prosthetic mobility can inform rehabilitation interventions, providing guidance in developing more comprehensive care for these individuals.


OBJECTIVE
Determine the influence of modifiable and non-modifiable variables related to LLA and their impact on prosthetic mobility, using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model. Secondarily, determining if personal factors and responses on self-report measures of balance and mobility are predictive of component timed-up-and-go (cTUG) performance.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study of a convenience sample.


SETTING
National conference PARTICIPANTS: People (N=68) with non-vascular causes of unilateral LLA.


METHODS
Assessment of anthropometrics, mobility, bilateral hip extensor strength, hip range of motion, single limb balance, and self-report measures. Lasso linear regression and extreme gradient boosting analyses were used to determine influence of variables on prosthetic mobility.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Timed performance of the cTUG.


RESULTS
The following five variables were found to influence basic prosthetic mobility (p â‰¤.05) in people with transtibial (TT) amputation: hip extensor strength, hip range of motion, single limb balance, waist circumference, and age. In the TF cohort, number of comorbidities and waist circumference primarily influenced prosthetic mobility. Additionally, 66% of the variance in cTUG total time for the entire sample could be explained by simply regressing on level of amputation, number of comorbidities, age and Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale score, all variables easily collected in a waiting room.


CONCLUSION
Variables that are modifiable with physical therapy intervention including hip extensor strength, hip range of motion, single limb balance, and waist circumference significantly influenced basic prosthetic mobility. These variables can be affected by targeted rehabilitation interventions and lifestyle changes.

Big Data Study about the Effects of Weather Factors on Food Poisoning Incidence,"Abstract This research attempts an analysis that fuses the big data concerning weather variation and health care from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2014; it gives the weather factor as to what kind of influence there is for the incidence of food poisoning, and also endeavors to be helpful regarding national health prevention. By using R, the Logistic and Lasso Logistic Regression were analyzed. The main factor germ generating the food poisoning was classified and the incidence was confirmed for the germ of bacteria and virus. According to the result of the analysis of Logistic Regression, we found that the incidence of bacterial food poisoning was affected by the following influences: the average temperature, amount of sunshine deviation, and deviation of temperature. Furthermore, the weather factors, having an effect on the incidence of viral food poisoning, were: the minimum vapor pressure, amount of sunshine deviation and deviation of temperature. This study confirmed the correlation of meteorological factors and incidence of food poisoning. It was also found out that even if the incidence from two causes were influenced by the same weather factor, the incidence might be oppositely affected by the characteristic of the germs.",2016,Journal of Digital Convergence
Bayesian Deformable Models Building via Stochastic Approximation Algorithm: A Convergence Study,"The problem of the definition and the estimation of generative models based on deformable templates from raw data is of particular importance for modelling non aligned data affected by various types of geometrical variability. This is especially true in shape modelling in the computer vision community or in probabilistic atlas building for Computational Anatomy (CA). A first coherent statistical framework modelling the geometrical variability as hidden variables has been given by Allassonniere, Amit and Trouve (JRSS 2006). Setting the problem in a Bayesian context they proved the consistency of the MAP estimator and provided a simple iterative deterministic algorithm with an EM flavour leading to some reasonable approximations of the MAP estimator under low noise conditions. In this paper we present a stochastic algorithm for approximating the MAP estimator in the spirit of the SAEM algorithm. We prove its convergence to a critical point of the observed likelihood with an illustration on images of handwritten digits.",2007,
Equivalent Partial Correlation Selection for High Dimensional Gaussian Graphical Models,"Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are frequently used to explore networks, such as gene regulatory networks, among a set of variables. Under the classical theory of GGMs, the graph construction amounts to finding the pairs of variables with nonzero partial correlation coefficients. However, this is infeasible for high dimensional problems for which the number of variables is larger than the sample size. We propose a surrogate of partial correlation coefficient, which is evaluated with a reduced conditional set and thus feasible for high dimensional problems. Under the faithfulness condition, we show that the surrogate partial correlation coefficient is equivalent to the true one in graph construction. The proposed method is not only computational efficient, but also outperforms the existing methods, such as graphical Lasso and node-wise regression, in graph construction, especially for the problems for which a large number of indirect associations are present. The proposed method is computationally efficient, and very flexible in data integration, covariate adjustment, network comparison, etc. Gaussian Graphical Model Consider a set of Gaussian random variables, there are two measures for their dependency: I Correlation Coefficient I Partial Correlation Coefficient: Compared to the partial correlation coefficient, the correlation coefficient is much weaker as marginally, i.e. directly or indirectly, all variables in a system are more or less correlated. The goal of GGM learning is to distinguish direct from indirect dependencies for all variables in a system. The partial correlation coefficient provides a measure for direct dependence as it will vanish for the indirect case. Applications I Gene regulatory networks: molecular mechanism underlying cancer with data available at The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). I Causal networks: time course data. I Stock network I Mutual fund network Covariance Selection let X = (X (1), . . .X (p)) denote a p-dimensional random vector drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution Np(Î¼,Î£). Denote the concentration matrix by C = Î£âˆ’1 = (Cij). Then Ïij |V\{i ,j} = âˆ’ Ci ,j âˆš Ci ,iCj ,j , i , j = 1, . . . , p. (1) The covariance selection method (Dempster, 1972; Lauritzen, 1996) is to identify the non-zero elements in the concentration matrix. However, it is not feasible for high dimensional problems with p > n. Limited order partial correlations The idea is to use low-order partial correlation as a surrogate of the full-order partial correlation, and it is widely acknowledged that the limited order partial correlation methods can result in something inbetween the full GGM (with correlations conditioned on all p âˆ’ 2 variables) and the correlation graph. Related work: Spirtes et al. (2000), Magwene and Kim (2004), Wille and BÃ¼hlmann (2006), Castelo and Roverato (2006, 2009). Nodewise Regression It is to use Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) as a variable selection method to identify the neighborhood of each variable, and thus the nonzero elements of the concentration matrix. Consider a linear regression X (j) = Î² (j) i X (i) + âˆ‘ râˆˆV\{j ,i} Î² (j) r X (r) + 2, (2) where 2(j) is a zero-mean Gaussian random error. Let S (j) = {r : Î² r 6= 0} denote the set of explanatory variables identified by Lasso for X (j). The GGM can then be constructed using the â€œorâ€-rule: estimate an edge between vertices i and j â‡â‡’ i âˆˆ S (j) or j âˆˆ S (i), or the â€œandâ€-rule: estimate an edge between vertices i and j â‡â‡’ i âˆˆ S (j) and j âˆˆ S (i). Graphical Lasso Yuan and Lin (2007) proposed to directly estimate the concentration matrix by minimizing âˆ’ log(det(C)) + trace(Î£Ì‚MLEC) + Î»â€–Câ€–, (3) where Î£Ì‚MLE denotes the maximum likelihood estimator of Î£, â€–Câ€– denotes the norm of C, and Î» is the regularization parameter. Later, the algorithm is accelerated by Friedman et al. (2008) and Banerjee et al. (2008). Graph Theory An undirected graph is a pair G = (V,E), where V is the set of vertices and E = (eij) is the adjacency matrix. I If two vertices i , j âˆˆ V forms an edge then we say that i and j are adjacent and set eij = 1. I The boundary set of a vertex v âˆˆ V, denoted by bG(v), is the set of vertices adjacent to v , i.e., bG(v) = {j : evj = 1}. I A path of length l > 0 from v0 to vl is a sequence v0, v1, . . . , vl of distinct vertices such that evkâˆ’1,vk = 1 for all k = 1, . . . , l . I The subset U âŠ‚ V is said to separate I âŠ‚ V from J âŠ‚ V if for every i âˆˆ I and j âˆˆ J, all paths from i to j have at least one vertex in U. I For a pair of vertices i 6= j with eij = 0, a set U âŠ‚ V is called a {i , j}-separator if it separates {i} and {j} in G. I Let Gij be a reduced graph of G with eij being set to zero. Then both the boundary sets bGij (i) and bGij (j) are {i , j}-separators in Gij . Graph Theory (continuation) Definition 1 We say that PV satisfies the Markov property with respect to G if for every triple of disjoint sets I, J,U âŠ‚ V, it holds that XI âŠ¥ XJ|XU whenever U separates I and J in G. Definition 2 We say that PV satisfies the adjacency faithfulness condition with respect to G: If two variables X (i) and X (j) are adjacent in G, then they are dependent conditioned on any subset of XV\{i ,j}. Graph Theory (continuation) The adjacency faithfulness condition implies that if there exists a subset U âŠ† V \ {i , j} such that X (i) âŠ¥ X |XU, then X (i) and X (j) are not adjacent in G. Further, by the Markov property, we have X (i) âŠ¥ X |XU =â‡’ X (i) âŠ¥ X |XV\{i ,j}, for any U âŠ† V \ {i , j} . (4) In particular, if U = âˆ…, we have X (i) and X (j) are marginally independent =â‡’ X (i) âŠ¥ X |XV\{i ,j}, (5) or, equivalently, Ïij |V\{i ,j} 6= 0 =â‡’ Corr{X ,X ) 6= 0. (6) Hence, to infer the conditional independence structure for a GGM, one may perform a correlation screening which can often reduce the dimensionality of the problem by a substantial amount. Equivalent Measure I Let G = (V, E) denote the correlation graph of X1, . . . ,Xp, where E = (áº½ij) is the edge set, and áº½ij = 1 if rij 6= 0 and 0 otherwise.

A dynamic model of the hand with application in functional neuromuscular stimulation,"Potential hand function in people with tetraplegia was evaluated using a three-dimensional dynamic mathematical model. The model was used to evaluate hand positioning, grasp force, and the outcome of surgeries such as tendon transfers and joint fusion, in situations typical of those encountered when using functional neuromuscular stimulation to restore function in people with tetraplegia. In the model, the hand is treated as a jointed multibody system. Each joint is subjected to muscle moments, passive joint moment, and moments due to grasp forces. Model simulations showed that function was highly dependent on both muscle strength and joint passive moments. The potential for tendon transfers, such as the Zancolli-lasso and intrinsic-plasty, to improve hand function was demonstrated, but their value is subject-dependent. It was also shown that activation of multiple thumb muscles (adductor pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, and flexor pollicis longus) without interphalangeal joint fusion can provide convenient lateral pinch posture with âˆ¼70% more grip force than a currently used method, which includes joint fusion but requires only one muscle. Finally, a grasp protocol was introduced and shown successful in palmar grasp and hold of movable cylindrical objects using only extrinsic muscles, provided the fingers could be extended sufficiently to enclose the object.",2007,Annals of Biomedical Engineering
Predicting seizures in pregnant women with epilepsy: Development and external validation of a prognostic model,"BACKGROUND
Seizures are the main cause of maternal death in women with epilepsy, but there are no tools for predicting seizures in pregnancy. We set out to develop and validate a prognostic model, using information collected during the antenatal booking visit, to predict seizure risk at any time in pregnancy and until 6 weeks postpartum in women with epilepsy on antiepileptic drugs.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
We used datasets of a prospective cohort study (EMPiRE) of 527 pregnant women with epilepsy on medication recruited from 50 hospitals in the UK (4 November 2011-17 August 2014). The model development cohort comprised 399 women whose antiepileptic drug doses were adjusted based on clinical features only; the validation cohort comprised 128 women whose drug dose adjustments were informed by serum drug levels. The outcome was epileptic (non-eclamptic) seizure captured using diary records. We fitted the model using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression, and reported the performance using C-statistic (scale 0-1, values > 0.5 show discrimination) and calibration slope (scale 0-1, values near 1 show accuracy) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We determined the net benefit (a weighted sum of true positive and false positive classifications) of using the model, with various probability thresholds, to aid clinicians in making individualised decisions regarding, for example, referral to tertiary care, frequency and intensity of monitoring, and changes in antiepileptic medication. Seizures occurred in 183 women (46%, 183/399) in the model development cohort and in 57 women (45%, 57/128) in the validation cohort. The model included age at first seizure, baseline seizure classification, history of mental health disorder or learning difficulty, occurrence of tonic-clonic and non-tonic-clonic seizures in the 3 months before pregnancy, previous admission to hospital for seizures during pregnancy, and baseline dose of lamotrigine and levetiracetam. The C-statistic was 0.79 (95% CI 0.75, 0.84). On external validation, the model showed good performance (C-statistic 0.76, 95% CI 0.66, 0.85; calibration slope 0.93, 95% CI 0.44, 1.41) but with imprecise estimates. The EMPiRE model showed the highest net proportional benefit for predicted probability thresholds between 12% and 99%. Limitations of this study include the varied gestational ages of women at recruitment, retrospective patient recall of seizure history, potential variations in seizure classification, the small number of events in the validation cohort, and the clinical utility restricted to decision-making thresholds above 12%. The model findings may not be generalisable to low- and middle-income countries, or when information on all predictors is not available.


CONCLUSIONS
The EMPiRE model showed good performance in predicting the risk of seizures in pregnant women with epilepsy who are prescribed antiepileptic drugs. Integration of the tool within the antenatal booking visit, deployed as a simple nomogram, can help to optimise care in women with epilepsy.",2019,PLoS Medicine
"Quantitative aspects of seagrass communities, particularly of those dominated by Halophila stipulacea, in Sinai (Northern Red Sea)","Abstract Seagrass communities of the Sinai coast may be divided into three groups according to their dry weight biomass. Thalassodendron ciliatum communities compose the first group reaching over 100 kg dry wt. m âˆ’2 . Communities dominated by Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea rotundata, Syringodium isoetifolium, Halophila stipulacea and all submerged and some intertidal communities dominated by Halodule uninervis compose the second group, in which biomass ranges from a few hundred grams to several kg dry wt. m âˆ’2 . The third group includes all communities dominated by Halophila ovalis , some intertidal communities of Halodule univervis and seeding communities of Halophila stipulacea . The most productive communities of H. stipulacea are those of shallow waters, but not the intertidal ones. The share of leaves in these communities increases with depth down to about 10 m, as compared with the subterranean parts, whereas leaf size continues to increase down to about 20 m. As vegetation density decreases below 10 m, the photosynthesizing area of the community also decreases below this depth, despite an increase in individual leaf area. Halodule uninervis communities show an even more pronounced increase of biomass from the intertidal belt downwards, within the limited depth range they occupy.",1979,Aquatic Botany
Learning Games and Rademacher Observations Losses,"It has recently been shown that supervised learning with the popular logistic loss is equivalent to optimizing the exponential loss over sufficient statistics about the class: Rademacher observations (rados). We first show that this unexpected equivalence can actually be generalized to other example / rado losses, with necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence, exemplified on four losses that bear popular names in various fields: exponential (boosting), mean-variance (finance), Linear Hinge (on-line learning), ReLU (deep learning), and unhinged (statistics). Second, we show that the generalization unveils a surprising new connection to regularized learning, and in particular a sufficient condition under which regularizing the loss over examples is equivalent to regularizing the rados (with Minkowski sums) in the equivalent rado loss. This brings simple and powerful rado-based learning algorithms for sparsity-controlling regularization, that we exemplify on a boosting algorithm for the regularized exponential rado-loss, which formally boosts over four types of regularization, including the popular ridge and lasso, and the recently coined slope --- we obtain the first proven boosting algorithm for this last regularization. Through our first contribution on the equivalence of rado and example-based losses, Omega-R.AdaBoost~appears to be an efficient proxy to boost the regularized logistic loss over examples using whichever of the four regularizers. Experiments display that regularization consistently improves performances of rado-based learning, and may challenge or beat the state of the art of example-based learning even when learning over small sets of rados. Finally, we connect regularization to differential privacy, and display how tiny budgets can be afforded on big domains while beating (protected) example-based learning.",2015,ArXiv
US Household Demand for Organic Fruit,"We estimate US household monthly elasticities of demand for some of the more popular organic fruits. To our knowledge, this is the first US-wide, multi-year analysis of price and income elasticities for various organic fruits. We calculate elasticities of demand for low-income, middle class, and rich income bracket households using three estimation techniques: two econometric methods and one machine learning method (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)). Demand estimates are based on Nielsen scanner data from approximately 60,000 households collected from 2011 to 2013. Generally, we find that own-price conditional and unconditional elasticities of demand for organic fruits are negative. Unconditional elasticity magnitudes tend to be largest in the representative middle-class household. Income elasticities of demand measurements are inconsistent and often statistically insignificant. This finding is consistent with the survey literature finding that many consumers buy organic food for mostly moral or ethical reasons. We run two policy experiments: a 10% subsidy of organic fruits, and a 10% tax on conventional fruits. Our hypothetical policies engender a stronger reaction among the general public than habitual buyers of organic fruit; unconditional purchase and expenditure elasticities are generally larger than conditional purchase and expenditure elasticities. Finally, we find that elasticities measured with the LASSO technique are not radically different than those measured with econometric methods. The most noticeable difference between the two analytical techniques is that LASSO is more likely to find price and income elasticities of demand that indistinguishable from zero, both substantively and statistically.",2017,Social Science Research Network
Human renal isografts: a clinical and pathologic analysis.,"Summaries â€“ RÃ©sumÃ©s Human renal isografts: A clinical and pathological analysis By Glassock, R.J.; Feldman, D.; Reynolds, E.S.; Dammin, G.J. and Merrill, J.P.: Medicine 47: 411 (1968). This report documents Peter Bent Brigham Hospital experience over 13 years with 22 patients receiving renal transplants from their presumed identical twin. Seventeen of the recipients had clinical and morphological evidence of glomerulo-nephritis. At the time of this writing, eleven had developed a recurrence of a similar disease in the isotransplanted kidney. Clinical and morphologic studies of the original disease identified the characteristics of patients carrying a high risk of recurrence. Recurrent glomerulonephritis was clinically characterized by protein-uria and hematuria and often by the subsequent development of the nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal failure. Glomerular hypercellularity was the most common histologic lesion associated with recurrence. Mesangial thickening was seen with and without clinical evidence of recurrence. Glomerular deposition of immunoglobulin G., Beta lc globulin and fibrinogen was associated with recurrent disease. By electronmicroscopy both subendothelial and subepithelial deposits were seen. It is concluded by the authors that recurrent glomerulonephritis in the recipient of renal isografts is most likely a manifestation of the same underlying process responsible for the original disease which led to transplantation.

Deposits of immunoglobulin and fibrin in human allografted kidneys By McKenzie, I.F.C. and Whittingham, S.: Lancet it: 1313 (1968). Eighty-two kidney sections from 28 human recipients of renal allografts were examined by immunofluorescence for deposits of immunoglobulin, complement and fibrin. Deposits of IgM and IgG, but not IgA were detected in vessels of all sizes; lining the endothelium, extending towards the media, and in larger vessels in the thickened intima. Linear and granular deposits were also present in glomeruli. Complement and fibrin were present but not albumin or alpb3â„4macroglobulin. Of 49 sections examined during clinical rejection, immunoglobulin, complement and fibrin were demonstrated in a significant number when compared with the incidence in 14 non-rejecting kidneys. The demonstration of these deposits suggests that humoral antibodies may play an important role in the rejection of human allografted kidneys. Authorâ€™s address: Dr. I.F.C.

Collective discovery of brain networks with unknown groups,"Brain network discovery has attracted much attention in recent years, which aims at inferring a set of cohesive regions (i.e., the network nodes) and the connectivity between these regions (i.e., the network edges) in brain from neuroimaging data (e.g., fMRI, PET scans). Previous methods on brain network discovery mainly focus on either estimating the connectivity based on predefined brain regions, or inferring the brain regions and connectivity independently. However, the tasks of discovering brain regions and their connectivity are highly related to each other and should be discovered collectively, instead of independently. In this work, we propose a coherent data-driven method called SGGL (Spectral Group Graphical Lasso) to derive the nodes and edges of a brain network simultaneously. We propose a screening strategy to reduce the time cost of solving the corresponding optimization problem. Extensive experiments are performed on both synthetic data and real data from ADHD-200 project. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2017,2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)

"Changes in abundance and community structure of nematodes from the abyssal polymetallic nodule field, Tropical Northeast Pacific","Abstract Deep-sea fields of polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCFZ, tropical NE Pacific) are currently being investigated to assess their potential for commercial mining. During such mining, benthic communities will be inevitably disturbed or destroyed. Therefore, assessments of their standing stock and composition may be helpful for the future evaluation of possible impacts of commercial nodule exploitation. Analysis of nematode communities (at genus level) inhabiting the French license area of the CCFZ were studied based on data from the cruises NODINAUT (2004) and BIONOD (2012). The total nematode density was ca. 1.5-fold higher in 2012 as compared with 2004. This reflected a 2â€“2.5 times higher density of non-selective deposit-feeders (i.e. possessing a small buccal cavity without armature) in 2012 compared with 2004, whereas no significant differences between sampling periods were observed in the density of the other feeding groups. Consequently, whilst the list of the most abundant genera was identical, their relative abundances changed significantly. The relative abundance of the genus Thalassomonhystera was two times greater in 2012 than in 2004, whereas the relative abundances of the genera Acantholaimus and Theristus were significantly lower in 2012 (10% and 4%, respectively) than in 2004 (28% and 9%). Nematode diversity (including values of diversity indices and total number of recorded genera) was significantly lower in 2012 in comparison with 2004. Although our data do not take into account seasonal and shorter temporal scales of variability in nematode assemblages, we report here that a certain fraction of variations observed between the two sampling periods could be associated with differences in primary production. Future studies should aim to better characterise temporal variability in nematode communities of the CCFZ at seasonal and interannual scales.",2015,
"Two Brachyphyllum species from the Lower Cretaceous of Jiuquan Basin, Gansu Province, NW China and their affinities and palaeoenvironmental implications","Abstract Conifers are common in the Lower Cretaceous Zhonggou Formation of Jiuquan Basin, Gansu Province, NW China. The excellent preservation of plant fossils allows detailed investigations of the leaf epidermis by light microscope (LM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Based on the leaf morphology and epidermal features, two Brachyphyllum species, B.Â ningshiaense and B.Â obtusum are described. They closely resemble one another in foliar morphology and epidermal features, but have different leaf apices, cuticle features, stomatal shape and the number of subsidiary cells. The specimens consist of leafy axes with imbricate, spirally arranged, scale-like leaves. Epidermal analysis shows rectangular, pentagonal or rhomboidal unspecialized epidermal cells and abaxially longitudinally arranged stomatal rows except for the marginal areas, as well as well-developed papillae, sunken stomata and Florin rings of subsidiary cells with papillae on the inner surfaces. The imbricate and spirally arranged leaves with rather thick cuticle in both species indicate an Araucariaceae ( Araucaria ) or Cheirolepidiaceae affinity. However, epidermal features and the presence of Classopollis pollen in the sediments indicate a cheirolepidiaceous affinity. The morphological and anatomical characters of both taxa are interpreted as adaptations to a warm seasonally and temporarily dry palaeoclimate.",2013,Cretaceous Research
Functional Linear Regression That â€™ s Interpretable,"Regression models to relate a scalar Y to a functional predictor X(t) are becoming increasingly common. Work in this area has concentrated on estimati ng a coefficient function, Î²(t), with Y related toX(t) through âˆ« Î²(t)X(t)dt. Regions whereÎ²(t) 6= 0 correspond to places where there is a relationship between X(t) andY. Alternatively, points whereÎ²(t) = 0 indicate no relationship. Hence, for interpretation purposes, it is de irable for a regression procedure to be capable of producing estimates of Î²(t) that are exactly zero over regions with no apparent relationship and have simple structures over the remaining regions. Unfortunately, most fitting procedures result in an estimate for Î²(t) that is rarely exactly zero and has unnatural wiggles making the curve hard to interpret. In this article we introd uce a new approach which uses variable selection ideas, applied to various derivatives o f Î²(t), to produce estimates that are both interpretable, flexible and accurate. We call our metho d â€œFunctional Linear Regression Thatâ€™s Interpretableâ€ (FLiRTI) and demonstrate it on simul ated and real world data sets. In addition, non-asymptotic theoretical bounds on the estima tion error are presented. The bounds provide strong theoretical motivation for our approach.

The value of statistical or bioinformatics annotation for rare variant association with quantitative trait.,"In the past few years, a plethora of methods for rare variant association with phenotype have been proposed. These methods aggregate information from multiple rare variants across genomic region(s), but there is little consensus as to which method is most effective. The weighting scheme adopted when aggregating information across variants is one of the primary determinants of effectiveness. Here we present a systematic evaluation of multiple weighting schemes through a series of simulations intended to mimic large sequencing studies of a quantitative trait. We evaluate existing phenotype-independent and phenotype-dependent methods, as well as weights estimated by penalized regression approaches including Lasso, Elastic Net, and SCAD. We find that the difference in power between phenotype-dependent schemes is negligible when high-quality functional annotations are available. When functional annotations are unavailable or incomplete, all methods suffer from power loss; however, the variable selection methods outperform the others at the cost of increased computational time. Therefore, in the absence of good annotation, we recommend variable selection methods (which can be viewed as ""statistical annotation"") on top of regions implicated by a phenotype-independent weighting scheme. Further, once a region is implicated, variable selection can help to identify potential causal single nucleotide polymorphisms for biological validation. These findings are supported by an analysis of a high coverage targeted sequencing study of 1,898 individuals.",2013,Genetic epidemiology
Cosmopolitanism on Board Venetian Ships (Fourteenth-Fifteenth Centuries),"During the Middle Ages the Republic of Venice sought to establish a thalassocracy in the Mediterranean by all possible means. To accomplish this end, succeeding governments used the maritime economy as the spearhead for their expanionist, colonial politics. Th e creation of a commercial and military fleet of the first order involved the resolution of the problem of recruitment of qualified manpower, available in spite of vicissitudes of conjoncture. Th e colonial empire had to keep the crews available at all moments. Certainly, the cosmopolitanism of men of the sea was a shared feature of the maritime powers of the time, but at Venice an evident particularism reigned. Numerous new colonial subjects both devoted and loyalâ€”Greeks, Dalmatians, and Albaniansâ€”constituted the essential components of the crews, with some contributions from the towns of Terra ferma.

"A N R Plasmid of Broad Host-range, Coding for Endemic I N Gram-negative Nosocomial Isolates Resistance to N I N E Antimicrobial Agents","Of 3952 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, 246 exhibited resistance to at least carbenicillin, gentamicin and tobramycin. All these isolates, representing eight genera, were resistant to at least nine antimicrobial agents in common, including the three key antibiotics and streptomycin, kanamycin, sisomycin, ampicillin, cephalothin and sulphonamide. The strains could be subdivided into seven groups depending upon additional resistance traits and some were resistant to as many as 15 antibiotics. When mated with a standard strain of Escherichia coli, 85% of 1 23 randomly selected donors transferred resistance to at least the nine core antibiotics. Some donors occasionally transferred resistance to two additional antibiotics, neomycin and tetracycline, while one Citrobacter freundi donor always transferred linked resistance to all 11 drugs. Although many donors were found to harbour more than one species of plasmid DNA, all except a strain of C. freundi contained at least a plasmid of mol. wt 89 x lo6. Analysis of E. coli transconjugants showed this plasmid to be responsible for transferable resistance to the nine core antibiotics. Restriction-endonuclease analysis indicates that the 89 x lo6 plasmids originating from different isolates were essentially identical with each other. These results show that a particular R plasmid has established itself among the Enterobacteriaceae at Hines VA Hospital. This R plasmid appears to be the predominant genetic element responsible for linked resistance to carbenicillin, gentamicin and tobramycin among these hospitalassociated bacteria.",2008,
Evaluation of safety and the success rate of cryoballoon ablation of the pulmonary vein ostia in patients with atrial fibrillation--a preliminary report.,"BACKGROUND
Cryoballon isolation of the pulmonary veins has recently emerged as a promissing technique for ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF).


AIM
To present our initial experience in cryoballon isolatin of the pulmonary veins in patients with AF.


METHODS
Eight patients (5 males; age 59+/-2 years) with AF: 2 with persistent and 6 with paroxysmal (5 of them after unsuccessful RF ablation) with >or=6 month follow-up after the procedure were included. One patient after myocardial infarction was treated with primary angioplasty with stent implantation. Another one had biatrial pacemaker. The procedure was performed with cryobaloon with 28 mm diameter (Arctic Front--Cryocath). After transseptal puncture mapping of the pulmonary vein ostia was performed with Lasso catheter (Johnson and Johnson). At each pulmonary vein ostium with pulmonary vein potentials 2 cryoapplications of 300 s duration was performed. Correct balloon placement before cryoapplication was checked using contrast injection into the pulmonary veins. During cryoapplication in the right pulmonary vein ostia permanent pacing of the phrenic nerve 30 beats per minute was performed to prevent its paralysis. After cryoapplications in all veins remapping with Lasso catheters was performed. In the absence of pulmonary vein potentials the procedure was finished, otherwise next cryoapplications were performed. During follow-up ECG was performed if any palpitations occurred, and 24-hour Holter monitoring was performed 1, 2 ,4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months after the procedure. A 2-month blanking period after the procedure was used. The lack of symptomatic AF and the absence of AF>30 s on Holter ECG monitoring were defined as successful procedure. An improvement was defined as reduction of frequency/duration of AF paroxysm and reduction of the EHRA index>or=1.


RESULTS
During 8 procedures isolation of 31 pulmonary vein was performed. Procedure duration was 3.5+/-0.85 h, fluoroscopy time--33.55+/-15.44 min, and total cryoapplication time--38.33+/-4.1 min. There were no complications. After the follow-up of 8.5+/-0.99 months 6 (75%) patients were free from arrhythmia, including the patient after myocardial infarction and one patient with permanent AF prior ablation. In another patient an improvement was observed (EHRA score II/III to I) whereas in one patient with permanent AF the procedure was unsuccessful.


CONCLUSION
Cryoballoon ablation of pulmonary vein ostia is effective and safe, and can be an alternative to RF ablation. Easier procedure technique make possible shortening of the learning curve and increase the number of treated patients.",2010,Kardiologia polska
Assoziation zwischen Restharnvolumen und Harnwegsinfektion,"ZusammenfassungHintergrundHarnwegsinfektionen (HWI) kÃ¶nnen Folge einer Blasenauslassobstruktion mit Restharnbildung sein. In einer aktuell publizierten Studie wurde hinsichtlich einer HWI asymptomatischen MÃ¤nnern ein Restharngrenzwert von â‰¥180Â ml definiert, der eine SensitivitÃ¤t von 87% und eine SpezifitÃ¤t von 98,5% bezÃ¼glich des Auftretens einer signifikanten Bakteriurie aufwies. Ziel der vorliegenden Untersuchung war, die Assoziation zwischen Restharnbildung und HWI bei asymptomatischen MÃ¤nnern zu Ã¼berprÃ¼fen und verschiedene Restharngrenzwerte zu validieren.Material und MethodeIn einer prospektiven Studie wurden 225 asymptomatische mÃ¤nnliche Patienten (medianes Alter 66Â Jahre) hinsichtlich folgender Kriterien untersucht: prostataspezifisches Antigen (PSA), Prostatavolumen, Internationaler Prostatasymptomenscore, maximaler Uroflow, Urinkultur, Urinschnelltest und Restharnvolumen. Mittels ROC-Analyse wurde ein Restharngrenzwert diskriminiert, aus dessen Assoziation mit einer signifikanten Bakteriurie bzw. einem positiven Urinschnelltest der hÃ¶chste AUC-Wert (â€žarea under the curve â€ž) resultierte. Der unabhÃ¤ngige Einfluss der erfassten Variablen auf die Entwicklung einer HWI (in Urinkultur oder Urinschnelltest) wurde mittels logistischer Regressionsanalyse Ã¼berprÃ¼ft.ErgebnisseBei 60% der asymptomatischen MÃ¤nner erfolgte die Miktion restharnfrei (â‰¤10Â ml); 31% der Probanden zeigten eine positive Urinkultur (n=69). Escherichia coli wurde bei 59 der 69Â MÃ¤nner (86%) mit positiver Urinkultur identifiziert. Patienten mit nachgewiesener Bakteriurie hatten ein signifikant hÃ¶heres Restharnvolumen im Vergleich zu Patienten mit negativer Urinkultur (113 vs. 41Â ml; p<0,001); 29Â MÃ¤nner (13%) hatten ein Restharnvolumen â‰¥180Â ml. Dieser Grenzwert besaÃŸ bezÃ¼glich des Nachweises einer positiven Urinkultur eine SensitivitÃ¤t und SpezifitÃ¤t von 28% bzw. 94% (AUC=0,606; p=0,012). In der Diskriminationsanalyse wies ein Restharngrenzwert von 150Â ml den hÃ¶chsten AUC-Wert auf (0,617). Restharnbildung zeigte in der multivariaten Regressionsanalyse einen unabhÃ¤ngigen Einfluss auf den Nachweis einer HWI (Urinkultur: p=0,006; Urinschnelltest: p<0,001).SchlussfolgerungenEs konnte kein Restharnvolumen als Grenzwert diskriminiert werden, das mit ausreichender SensitivitÃ¤t und SpezifitÃ¤t eine signifikant positive Urinkultur wahrscheinlich macht. Aus den Ergebnissen dieser Studie und den gegenwÃ¤rtig verfÃ¼gbaren Daten kann nicht sicher geschlussfolgert werden, ab welchem Restharnvolumen das Auftreten eines HWI wahrscheinlich und somit eine medikamentÃ¶se oder operative Intervention sinnvoll ist. Die Indikationsstellung zu einer therapeutischen Intervention muss sich folglich an weiteren Kriterien orientieren.AbstractPurposeUrinary tract infections can result from bladder outlet obstruction and consecutive post-void residual urine. In a recent publication, a cutoff for post-void residual urine of 180Â ml was calculated, revealing sensitivity and specificity of 87 and 98.5%, respectively, regarding occurrence of significant bacteriuria in asymptomatic men. In the present study the association between post-void residual urine volume and urinary tract infection was evaluated, and different cutoff values were validated.Materials und methodsA total of 225 asymptomatic patients (median age 66Â years) were prospectively evaluated regarding the following criteria: prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, International Prostate Symptom Score, peak urinary flow rate, urine culture results, urinary test strip, and post-void residual urine volume. By ROC analysis a cutoff predicting significant bacteriuria was calculated, and different cutoff values were validated. The independent influence of several parameters on the incidence of urinary tract infection was measured using multivariate regression analyses.ResultsOf the patients, 60% were able to completely empty the bladder (post-void residual urine volume â‰¤10Â ml); 31% (n=69) had significant bacteriuria in the urine culture. Escherichia coli was identified in 59 of 69 patients (86%) with positive urine culture. Patients presenting with urinary tract infection had significantly higher mean post-void residual urine volumes than patients with negative urine culture (113 vs 41Â ml, p<0.001). In 29 men (13%) residual volume was 180Â ml or greater. Regarding the coincidence of urinary tract infection, this cutoff value showed sensitivity and specificity of 28 and 94%, respectively (AUC: 0.606, p=0.012). By ROC analysis a cutoff value of 150Â ml revealed the highest AUC value (0.617). Post-void residual volume had an independent significant influence on detection of urinary tract infection in multivariate regression analysis (urine culture: p=0.006; urinary test strip: p<0.001).ConclusionsNo cutoff value could be determined to predict positive urine culture with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Based on the results of the present study and currently available data from the literature we are not able to recommend a cutoff value leading to therapeutic consequences. Hence, to establish the indication for treatment further criteria should be taken into consideration.",2010,Der Urologe
Non-marine Cretaceous Palynomorph Biostratigraphy of Argentina:a Brief Summary,"An evaluation of the Cretaceous palynostratigraphy of Argentina has been undertaken,by reviewing published data of the geological units with palynomorphs.Formal and informal biozonation schemes were compiled from seven Cretaceous Argentinean basins presented from north to south:the Salta Group Basin,San Luis Basin,Neuquen Basin,Austral Basin,Deseado Massif,San Jorge Gulf Basin,and extra-andean Patagonia.The Early Cretaceous palynological associations are relatively well-known in Argentina;however there is sparse published literature describing and discussing Late Cretaceous miofloras.The association of gymnosperm pollen grains,with conifer affinity Cyclusphaera-Balmeiopsis-Classopollis dominates in all the palynofloras from the Valanginian to the Aptian.Celyphus rallus(filamentous cyanobacteria) appears together with Cyclusphaera but disappears in the Barremian in all the Patagonian basins.Pollen grains belonging to basal angiosperms are important stratigraphic markers in Aptian sediments and younger,and have been used to define palynozones.Peninsulapollis gillii which corresponds to the first record of the Proteaceae family in Argentina is one of the few species,which occurs in all the late Campanian Maastrichtian associations,sometimes together with Grapnelispora loncochensis.Their presence could be indicative of a provisional palynozone.A preliminary correlation chart of the palynozones is presented together with a chart of the main Cretaceousstratigraphic units.",2012,Journal of stratigraphy
15 Month follow up of African children following vaginal cleansing with benzalkonium chloride of their HIV infected mothers during late pregnancy and delivery.,"OBJECTIVES
To study mother to child HIV-1 transmission (MTCT) and infant mortality following benzalkonium chloride (BC) disinfection.


METHODS
A randomised, double blind phase II placebo controlled trial. Women testing positive for HIV-1 infection in prenatal care units in Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, from November 1996 to April 1997 were eligible, with their informed consent. Women self administered daily a vaginal suppository of 1% BC (53) or matched placebo (54) from 36 weeks of pregnancy, plus a single dose during labour. The neonate was bathed with 1% BC solution or placebo within 30 minutes after birth. MTCT rate was assessed based on repeated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology results. For the present analysis, children were followed up to 15 months.


RESULTS
A total of 107 women were enrolled. Of 103 eligible liveborn children, 23 were HIV infected, 75 uninfected, and five of indeterminate status. MTCT transmission rate was 24.2% overall (95% confidence interval (CI): 14.3% to 30.4%). On an intent to treat basis, the transmission rate did not differ between the two groups (23.5%, CI 13.8 to 38.5, in the BC group and 24.8%, CI 15.0 to 39.6, in the placebo group at 15 months). Similarly, there was no difference in mortality at 15 months (22.9%, CI 13.7 to 36.9, in the BC group and 16.5%, CI 9.0 to 29.4, in the placebo group).


CONCLUSION
This analysis failed to suggest any benefit of BC disinfection on mother to child HIV transmission or perinatal and infant mortality.",2002,Sexually transmitted infections
LETTER TO EDITOR Nerve Regeneration in Neuropathic Pain,"With great interest we noticed the analgesic effect ofpalmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in pudendal neuralgia, asdescribed in a recent case report [1]. Recently, at the ThirdInternational Congress on Neuropathic Pain (NP), thegroup of Biasiotta presented new data in 30 neuropathicpain patients treated with PEA [2]. NP, positive sensorysymptoms, and amplitudes of the action potentials mea-sured by laser-evoked potentials improved signiï¬cantly.These ï¬ndings might point to nerve regenerating proper-ties of PEA, and therefore deserve more attention.Various supplements demonstrated nerve generativeproperties, as has been shown in animal models [3].Acetyl-L-carnitine can be seen as a prototype of the classof rational supplements. This drug signiï¬cantly increasedthe number of ï¬bers and regenerating clusters in patientssuffering from NP in diabetes [4]. Alpha-lipoic acid hascomparable nerve regenerating properties, as has beendemonstrated via nerve conduction velocity studies [5].Sadly enough, supplements such as PEA do not receiveadequate attention of the research community due to thefact that these molecules are not patent protected. Evenpositive results of meta-analysis and well-randomizedcontrolled trials are not implemented by the prescribingphysicians, neither are these results part of modern treat-ment guidelines [6,7].In our institute, we also regularly see clinically relevantanalgesic responses in otherwise treatment refractory NPpatients, after adding the aforementioned supplements toa regular treatment regimen. Hopefully, with the emergingrecognition of the relevance of multimodal therapies forNP, rational supplements will be taken into account.D",2010,
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs): a patient perspective on assessment and prevention in primary care,"ABritish MedicalAssociation(BMA)report Reporting Adverse Drug Reactions, May 2006, estimated that 250 000 people a year are admitted to hospital suffering harmful effects of prescription drugs at a cost to the NHSof about Â£466 million a year. This is based on a 2004 study of hospital admissions. The BMAreport draws attention to a crisis in public health that is largely being ignored and considers how medical education is failing both patients and doctors. The number of patients suffering and deaths due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs), addiction and withdrawal problems is underestimated, often unrecognised and not well reported. Ignoring the problem is costly in financial and human terms. The following paper describes the importance of the patient experience and recommends the need for systematic changes in practice and education of both the profession and the public in the recognition of ADRs. The paper includes recommendations for primary care trusts to be proactive in encouraging professional and patient Yellow Card ADR reporting, and to remind doctors of their moral duty to inform coroners of possible ADRs that may have preceded sudden death, suicide or fatal accidents. The paper concludes by emphasising the need for good practice in monitoring the sideeffectsof medicines, in order that patients gain the maximum benefits from their medicines",2007,Quality in primary care
Geographically weighted lasso (GWL) study for modeling the diarrheic to achieve open defecation free (ODF) target,"Diarrhea has been one main cause of morbidity and mortality to children around the world, especially in the developing countries According to available data that was mentioned. It showed that sanitary and healthy lifestyle implementation by the inhabitants was not good yet. Inadequacy of environmental influence and the availability of health services were suspected factors which influenced diarrhea cases happened followed by heightened percentage of the diarrheic. This research is aimed at modelling the diarrheic by using Geographically Weighted Lasso method. With the existence of spatial heterogeneity was tested by Breusch Pagan, it was showed that diarrheic modeling with weighted regression, especially GWR and GWL, can explain the variation in each location. But, the absence of multi-collinearity cases on predictor variables, which were affecting the diarrheic, resulted in GWR and GWL modelling to be not different or identical. It is shown from the resulting MSE value. While from R2 value which usually higher on GWL model showed a significant variable predictor based on more parametric shrinkage value.",2014,
Controlling the false discovery rate via knockoffs,"In many fields of science, we observe a response variable together with a large number of potential explanatory variables, and would like to be able to discover which variables are truly associated with the response. At the same time, we need to know that the false discovery rate (FDR) - the expected fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries - is not too high, in order to assure the scientist that most of the discoveries are indeed true and replicable. This paper introduces the knockoff filter, a new variable selection procedure controlling the FDR in the statistical linear model whenever there are at least as many observations as variables. This method achieves exact FDR control in finite sample settings no matter the design or covariates, the number of variables in the model, or the amplitudes of the unknown regression coefficients, and does not require any knowledge of the noise level. As the name suggests, the method operates by manufacturing knockoff variables that are cheap - their construction does not require any new data - and are designed to mimic the correlation structure found within the existing variables, in a way that allows for accurate FDR control, beyond what is possible with permutation-based methods. The method of knockoffs is very general and flexible, and can work with a broad class of test statistics. We test the method in combination with statistics from the Lasso for sparse regression, and obtain empirical results showing that the resulting method has far more power than existing selection rules when the proportion of null variables is high.",2015,Annals of Statistics
A Hybrid Supervised Approach to Human Population Identification Using Genomics Data.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are one type of genetic variations and each SNP represents a difference in a single DNA building block, namely a nucleotide. Previous research demonstrated that SNPs can be used to identify the correct source population of an individual. In addition, variations in the DNA sequences have an influence on human diseases. In this regard, SNPs studies are helpful for personalised medicine and treatment. In the literature, unsupervised clustering methods especially principal component analysis (PCA) have been popular for studying population structure. In this study, we investigate supervised approaches, particularly the LASSO multinomial regression classification method, for recognizing individuals' origin genetic population. Then, we introduce PCA-LASSO as an extension of LASSO method that benefits from advantageous characteristics of both PCA and LASSO regression. The experimental results obtained on the 1000 genome project dataset show PCA-LASSO's significantly high accuracy in prediction of individual's origin population.",2019,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics
m6A RNA methylation regulators can contribute to malignant progression and impact the prognosis of bladder cancer,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common form of mRNA modification. An increasing number of studies have provenÂ that m6A RNA methylation regulators are overexpressed in many cancers and participate in the development of cancer through the dynamic regulation of m6A RNA methylation regulators. However, the prognosticÂ role of m6A RNA methylation regulators in bladder cancer (BC) is poorly understood. In this study, we downloaded the mRNA expressionÂ data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the corresponding clinical and prognostic information. The relationship between m6A RNA methylation regulators and clinicopathologicalÂ variables was assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The expression of the m6A RNA methylation regulatorsÂ was differentially associated with different clinicopathological variables of BC patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression modelÂ was then applied to identify three m6A RNA methylation regulators. The riskÂ signatureÂ was constructed as follows: 0.164FTO - (0.081YTHDC1+0.032WTAP). Based on the risk signature, the risk score of each patient was calculated, and the patients were divided into a high-risk group and a low-risk group. TheÂ overall survival (OS) rate of the high-risk group was significantly lower than that of the low-risk group. The risk signature wasÂ not only an independent prognostic markerÂ for BC patients but also a predictor of clinicopathologicalÂ variables. In conclusion, m6A RNA methylation regulators can participate in the malignant progression of BC, and a risk signatureÂ with three selected m6A RNA methylation regulators may be a promising prognostic biomarker to guide personalized treatment for BC patients.",2019,Bioscience Reports
Partial Separability and Functional Graphical Models for Multivariate Gaussian Processes,"The covariance structure of multivariate functional data can be highly complex, especially if the multivariate dimension is large, making extension of statistical methods for standard multivariate data to the functional data setting quite challenging. For example, Gaussian graphical models have recently been extended to the setting of multivariate functional data by applying multivariate methods to the coefficients of truncated basis expansions. However, a key difficulty compared to multivariate data is that the covariance operator is compact, and thus not invertible. The methodology in this paper addresses the general problem of covariance modeling for multivariate functional data, and functional Gaussian graphical models in particular. As a first step, a new notion of separability for multivariate functional data is proposed, termed partial separability, leading to a novel Karhunen-Loeve-type expansion for such data. Next, the partial separability structure is shown to be particularly useful in order to provide a well-defined Gaussian graphical model that can be identified with a sequence of finite-dimensional graphical models, each of fixed dimension. This motivates a simple and efficient estimation procedure through application of the joint graphical lasso. Empirical performance of the method for graphical model estimation is assessed through simulation and analysis of functional brain connectivity during a motor task.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
An algorithm framework of sparse minimization for positive definite quadratic forms,Abstract Many well-known machine learning and pattern recognition methods can be seen as special cases of sparse minimization of Positive Definite Quadratic Forms (PDQF). An algorithm framework of sparse minimization is proposed for PDQF. It is theoretically analyzed to converge to global minimum. The computational complexity is analyzed and compared with the state-of-the-art Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA). Some well-known machine learning and pattern recognition methods are illustrated to be optimized by the proposed algorithm framework. Illustrative experiments show that Sparse Representation Classification (SRC) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) via the proposed method converges much faster than several classical methods.,2015,Neurocomputing
Adaptive LASSO estimation for ARDL models with GARCH innovations,"ABSTRACT In this paper, we show the validity of the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) procedure in estimating stationary autoregressive distributed lag(p,q) models with innovations in a broad class of conditionally heteroskedastic models. We show that the adaptive LASSO selects the relevant variables with probability converging to one and that the estimator is oracle efficient, meaning that its distribution converges to the same distribution of the oracle-assisted least squares, i.e., the least square estimator calculated as if we knew the set of relevant variables beforehand. Finally, we show that the LASSO estimator can be used to construct the initial weights. The performance of the method in finite samples is illustrated using Monte Carlo simulation.",2015,Econometric Reviews

Identification of Novel Genes Associated with Platelet Activation Signalling Pathways in High Dimensional Data Using an Alternative Regression Approach,"Platelet activation involves different signalling pathways in the underlying thrombus formation process. These pathways are the result of platelet responses to agonists9 activation. Previous analyses involving four pathways (P-selectin in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), P-selectin in response to cross-linked polypeptide (CRP), fibrinogen binding stimulated with ADP and fibrinogen binding stimulated with CRP) revealed genomic associations regulating these pathways. These analyses were performed on single nucleotide polymorphisms data (SNPs) in which the underlying characteristic of these data normally contains small number of observations (N) and large number of variables or features (p). However, the methodologies used in analysing these genomic data involved linear models using stepwise regression. We argue that this approach deemed to be sub optimal for linear modelling analyses. We propose an alternative approach using more rob ust methods such as ridge regression and LASSO that would produce previously unknown novel SNPs describing their effects on the four pathways in the available large pool of SNPs. Methodology The genome-wide association (GWA) data containing 1554 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 512 individuals describing their effects on four signalling pathways were previously analysed statistically using stepwise regression[1] which is sub optimal[2]. We statistically re-analysed these data using both stepwise regression and shrinkage approaches. Results Several of the SNPs and their associated genes identified using our new stepwise approach were not previously selected, though are now found to be significant. Conclusion We propose shrinkage approach for linear models using ridge regression and LASSO for statistical analysis of genomic data with large p and small N.",2014,Heart
[Toxicologic characteristics of several pesticides and standards for them in water].,"The progressive increase of production and application of chemicals for plant protection transmuted the problem of protection of water cleanliness into an international and national problem. The cases with incidental pesticide pollution of water-reservoirs became more numerous. A necessity arose of the supplement of our sanitary legislation with hygienic standards (MAC) for the water for the newly implemented chemicals for plant protection in the country. During the last several years, some of the most frequently used and formulated in our country pesticides were experimentally studied: Afalon and Patoran (from chemical group of carbamates and dithiocarbamates) and amide herbicide: Dimid, Ramrod, Lasso, Treflan. Complex hygienic-toxicological studies were carried out in order to study the toxicological effect of the pesticides mentioned and to elaborate hygienic norms (MAC) of the same in the water. The effect on the organoleptic qualities of water was determined as well as on the sanitary regime of waterreservoirs (according to BON5, sanitary-indictory microflora and toxicity for fishes). Toxicological studies were performed under the conditions of acute, subacute and chronic experiment. The results obtained allowed the hygienic-toxicological characteristics and the proposal of hygienic standards (MAC) for the pesticides studied in water.",1983,Problemi na khigienata
"The Role of Vanadium in the Chemical Defense of the Solitary Tunicate, Phallusia nigra","Ascidians (sea squirts) may defend themselves from predators, biofouling competitors, and bacterial infection by producing secondary metabolites or sequestering acid, but many species also accumulate heavy metals, most notably vanadium. The defensive functions of heavy metals in ascidians remain unclear, and to this end, the solitary Caribbean tunicate, Phallusia nigra, was studied to localize vanadium in its tissues and to assess the defensive properties of vanadium-containing compounds. As determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy, the internal tissues and blood contained the highest vanadium concentrations (mean values of 2,280 and 1,886Â ppm dry mass, respectively), followed by the tunic surface (871Â ppm dry mass). Results of laboratory feeding assays with the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, confirmed outcomes of past studies that demonstrated that vanadyl sulfate (VOSO4Â·6H2O) and sodium vanadate (Na3VO4) were unpalatable to fish, although these salts do not accurately reflect the chelation environment or oxidation state of vanadium in living tunicates. Fresh preparations of whole tunic, internal tissues, and blood were unpalatable to fish, but freezing and thawing of internal tissues and blood rendered them palatable. Crude organic extracts of whole tunic and internal tissues contained vanadium metabolites (225 and 750Â ppm dry mass, respectively) and were palatable to T. bifasciatum; crude extracts also exhibited no antimicrobial effects against a panel of four marine bacteria known to be pathogens of marine invertebrates (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Leucothrix mucor, and Deleya marina). Nonacidic vanadium (+3) complexes neither deterred predation nor inhibited microbial growth, whereas acidic aqua vanadium (+3 and +4) complexes were unpalatable to T. bifasciatum and exhibited antimicrobial activity. Difficulties in decoupling low pH from oxidation state and chelation environment of vanadium prevent definitive conclusions about the importance of some vanadium metabolites, but low pH appears to be the principal agent of chemical defense for P. nigra.",2007,Journal of Chemical Ecology
Predicting Thalasso Tourist Delight: A Hybrid SEM - Artificial Intelligence Analysis,"This study focuses on the influence of the quality of services received by thalassotherapy customers on their global satisfaction and the relationship between this and the word of mouth. This study uses a hybrid SEMâ€”classification tree analysis. The empirical findings reveal a significant relationship between the quality of each offered service and global satisfaction. This study contributes to identify touristâ€™s satisfaction or delight on received thalasso services through a proposed methodology. The main contribution of this work consists of the proposal of a methodology to identify objectively through the opinion of tourists if they were satisfied or had reached delight. This work demonstrates, confirming what has been found in previous literature, that global satisfaction is related to the different experiences provided by the service. Thus, all hypotheses are accepted, supporting the hypotheses that relate the pool, the staff, the treatments, and the environment to satisfaction. In addition, the hypotheses that link satisfaction with the word of mouth are also supported. This theoretical implication has important practical implications for managers of the type of facilities such as those studied in this paper, since it shows that it is not enough to do well in one of the services provided if the environment or the interaction with the staff is not right.",2018,Complexity
Using imaging biomarkers to predict radiation induced xerostomia in head and neck cancer,"In this study, we analyzed baseline CT- and MRI-based image features of salivary glands to predict radiation-induced xerostomia after head-and-neck cancer (HNC) radiotherapy. A retrospective analysis was performed on 216 HNC patients who were treated using radiotherapy at a single institution between 2009 and 2016. CT and T1 post-contrast MR images along with NCI-CTCAE xerostomia grade (3-month follow-up) were prospectively collected at our institution. Image features were extracted for ipsilateral/contralateral parotid and submandibular glands relative to the location of the primary tumor. Dose-volume-histogram (DVH) parameters were also acquired. Features that were correlated with xerostomia (p<0.05) were further reduced using a LASSO logistic regression. Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were used to predict xerostomia under five conditions (DVH-only, CT-only, MR-only, CT+MR, and DVH+CT+MR) using a ten-fold cross validation. The prediction performance was determined using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). DeLongâ€™s test was used to determine the difference between the ROC curves. Among extracted features, 13 CT, 6 MR, and 4 DVH features were selected. The ROC-AUC values for GLM/SVM classifiers with DVH, CT, MR, CT+MR and all features were 0.72Â±0.01/0.72Â±0.01, 0.73Â±0.01/0.68Â±0.01, 0.68Â±0.01/0.63Â±0.01, 0.74Â±0.01/0.75Â±0.01, and 0.78Â±0.01/0.79Â±0.01, respectively. DeLongâ€™s test demonstrated an improved in AUC for both classifiers with the addition of all features compared to DVH, CT, and MR-alone (p<0.05) and the SVM CT+MR model (p=0.03). The integration of baseline image features into prediction models has the potential to improve xerostomia risk stratification with the ultimate goal of personalized HNC radiotherapy.",2019,

Derivative in a Murine Model of Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common chronic degenerative joint disease, is characterized by inflammation, degradation of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone lesions, causing pain and decreased functionality.

NF-ÎºB pathway is involved in OA and, in most cases, its activation depends on the phosphorylation and degradation of IÎºBÎ±, the NF-ÎºB endogenous inhibitor that sequesters NF-ÎºB in the cytosol. Under inflammatory stimuli, IÎºBÎ± is degraded by the IKK signalosome and NF-ÎºB moves into the nucleus, inducing the transcription of inflammatory mediator genes and catabolic enzymes. The IKK signalosome includes IKKÎ² and IKKÎ± kinases, the latter shown to be pivotal in the OA extracellular matrix derangement. The current OA therapies are not curative and nowadays, the preclinical research is evaluating new structure-modifying pharmacological treatments, able to prevent or delay cartilage degradation.

N-acetyl phenylalanine derivative (NAPA), is a derivative of glucosamine, a constituent of the glycosaminoglycans of cartilage and a chondroprotective agent. Previous in vitro studies showed the ability of NAPA to increase cartilage components and to reduce inflammatory cytokines, inhibiting IKKÎ± kinase activity and its nuclear migration.

The present study aims to further clarify the effect of NAPA in counteracting OA progression, in an in vivo mouse model after destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM).

Mice were divided into 3 groups:

DMM surgery was performed in the right knee, according to Glasson SS [2], while the left knee did not undergo any surgery. Four weeks after surgery (mild-to-moderate OA), some animals received one intra-articular injection of NAPA (2.5 mM) and after 2 weeks, the animals were pharmacologically euthanized. The mice of the 1st group were euthanized 4 weeks after DMM and those of the 3rd group after 6 weeks from their arrival in the animal facility. At the end of experimental times, both knee joints of the animals were analyzed through histology, histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry and subchondral bone microhardness.

The injection of NAPA significantly improved cartilage structure, increased cartilage thickness ( p <0.0005), reduced Chambers and Mankin scores ( p <0.005), fibrillation index ( p <0.005) and decreased MMP13 ( p <0.05) and ADAMTS5, MMP10, and IKKÎ± ( p <0.0005) staining. The microhardness measurements did not shown statistically significant differences between groups.

This study demonstrated the chondroprotective activities exerted by NAPA in vivo . NAPA markedly improved the physical structure of articular cartilage and reduced the amount of catabolic enzymes, and therefore of extracellular matrix remodeling. The reduction in OA grading and catabolic enzymes paralleled the reduction of IKKÎ± expression. This further hints at a pivotal role of IKKÎ± in OA development by regulating MMP activity through the control of procollagenase (MMP10) expression. We believe that the preliminary preclinical data, here presented, contribute to improve the knowledge on the development of disease modifying drugs since we showed the ability of NAPA of reverting the surgically induced OA in the widely accepted DMM model.",2017,Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery-british Volume
A Data Adaptive Biological Sequence Representation for Supervised Learning,"Proper expression of the genes plays a vital role in the function of an organism. Recent advancements in DNA microarray technology allow for monitoring the expression level of thousands of genes. One of the important tasks in this context is to understand the underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Recently, researchers have focused on identifying local DNA elements, or motifs to infer the relation between the expression and the nucleotide sequence of the gene. This study proposes a novel data adaptive representation approach for supervised learning to predict the response associated with the biological sequences. Biological sequences such as DNA and protein are a class of categorical sequences. In machine learning, categorical sequences are generally mapped to a lower dimensional representation for learning tasks to avoid problems with high dimensionality. The proposed method, namely SW-RF (sliding window-random forest), is a feature-based approach requiring two main steps to learn a representation for categorical sequences. In the first step, each sequence is represented by overlapping subsequences of constant length. Then a tree-based learner on this representation is trained to obtain a bag-of-words like representation which is the frequency of subsequences on the terminal nodes of the tree for each sequence. After representation learning, any classifier can be trained on the learned representation. A lasso logistic regression is trained on the learned representation to facilitate the identification of important patterns for the classification task. Our experiments show that proposed approach provides significantly better results in terms of accuracy on both synthetic data and DNA promoter sequence data. Moreover, a common problem for microarray datasets, namely missing values, is handled efficiently by the tree learners in SW-RF. Although the focus of this paper is on biological sequences, SW-RF is flexible in handling any categorical sequence data from different applications.",2018,Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research

"New methods for meta-analysis under a fixed effects framework, with frequentist and Bayesian estimation.","New methods for meta-analysis under a fixed effects framework, with frequentist and Bayesian estimation Clara P. DomÄ±Ìnguez Islas Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Ph.D. Kenneth M. Rice Biostatistics Meta-analysis, as a pivotal component of systematic reviews, has been used extensively in recent years to synthesize the increasing amount of evidence produced in medical and health care research. The two main approaches to meta-analysis are based either on the assumption that all studies estimate a single common effect or on the assumption that the effects are sampled from an unknown distribution. In this dissertation, we propose and develop methods for an alternative approach to meta-analysis, based on the assumption that the effects estimated in the different studies are unknown, but fixed and not necessarily identical. In Chapter 1 we present a brief introduction and review of current methods for meta-analysis. In Chapter 2, we provide a novel yet simple justification for the precision weighted average estimator, commonly used in meta-analysis. Unlike standard arguments that require a homogeneity assumption on the study effects, our justification is based on an optimality property of this particular weighted average of the effect-size parameters, among the class of all affine combinations. We also propose a parameter to quantify the heterogeneity observed in the studies at hand, as an alternative to the classical betweenstudies variance in a random effects approach. We propose frequentist estimators of these parameters, illustrating their properties through an applied example and evaluating their performance in a simulation study. In Chapter 3, we propose Bayesian methods for estimation of the location and dispersion parameters. We discuss how different prior beliefs like homogeneity, exchangeability or correlation, can be incorporated through a variety of prior distributions that may or may not involve the use of hyper parameters. Important properties of the estimators obtained from a conjugate prior are derived analytically and then illustrated in an example. In Chapter 4, we explore methods to improve on the estimation of the individual effects themselves, rather than a summary of them. We discuss some ideas on shrinkage estimation and convex clustering adapted to meta-analysis, with particular attention to penalized estimation. We propose a loss function which takes into account the precision of the effect estimates, and can be seen either as a weighted version of the Fused Lasso Signal Approximator (FLSA) or a specific case of a Convex Cluster criterion. We derive some important properties of the solutions to the loss function, which allow us to construct an efficient algorithm to obtain the complete solution path. We also propose a novel procedure based on the parametric bootstrap for the estimation of the tuning parameter, and present results from a simulation study evaluating the proposed shrinkage estimation method. Finally, we conclude with a discussion and conclusions in Chapter 5.",2015,
Should Penalized Least Squares Regression be Interpreted as Maximum A Posteriori Estimation?,"Penalized least squares regression is often used for signal denoising and inverse problems, and is commonly interpreted in a Bayesian framework as a Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator, the penalty function being the negative logarithm of the prior. For example, the widely used quadratic program (with an <i>l</i><sup>1</sup> penalty) associated to the LASSO/basis pursuit denoising is very often considered as MAP estimation under a Laplacian prior in the context of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) reduction. This paper highlights the fact that, while this is one possible Bayesian interpretation, there can be other equally acceptable Bayesian interpretations. Therefore, solving a penalized least squares regression problem with penalty Ï†(<i>x</i>) need not be interpreted as assuming a prior <i>C</i>Â·exp(-Ï†(<i>x</i>)) and using the MAP estimator. In particular, it is shown that for any prior <i>PX</i>, the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator is the solution of a penalized least square problem with some penalty Ï†(<i>x</i>) , which can be interpreted as the MAP estimator with the prior <i>C</i>Â·exp(-Ï†(<i>x</i>)). Vice versa, for certain penalties Ï†(<i>x</i>), the solution of the penalized least squares problem is indeed the MMSE estimator, with a certain prior <i>PX</i> .

Accuracy of genomic prediction using different models and response variables in the Nordic Red cattle population.,"Breeding animals can be accurately evaluated using appropriate genomic prediction models, based on marker data and phenotype information. In this study, direct genomic values (DGV) were estimated for 16 traits of Nordic Total Merit (NTM) Index in Nordic Red cattle population using three models and two different response variables. The three models were as follows: a linear mixed model (GBLUP), a Bayesian variable selection model similar to BayesA (BayesA*) and a Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model (Bayesian Lasso). The response variables were deregressed proofs (DRP) and conventional estimated breeding values (EBV). The reliability of genomic predictions was measured on bulls in the validation data set as the squared correlation between DGV and DRP divided by the reliability of DRP. Using DRP as response variable, the reliabilities of DGV among the 16 traits ranged from 0.151 to 0.569 (average 0.317) for GBLUP, from 0.152 to 0.576 (average 0.318) for BayesA* and from 0.150 to 0.570 (average 0.320) for Bayesian Lasso. Using EBV as response variable, the reliabilities ranged from 0.159 to 0.580 (average 0.322) for GBLUP, from 0.157 to 0.578 (average 0.319) for BayesA* and from 0.159 to 0.582 (average 0.325) for Bayesian Lasso. In summary, Bayesian Lasso performed slightly better than the other two models, and EBV performed slightly better than DRP as response variable, with regard to prediction reliability of DGV. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Moreover, using EBV as response variable would result in problems with the scale of the resulting DGV and potential problem due to double counting.",2013,Journal of animal breeding and genetics = Zeitschrift fur Tierzuchtung und Zuchtungsbiologie
Genomic Selection using Multiple Populations,"Using different populations in genomic selection raises the possibility of marker effects varying across populations. However, common models for genomic selection only account for the main marker effects, assuming that they are consistent across populations. We present an approach in which the main plus population-specific marker effects are simultaneously estimated in a single mixed model. Cross-validation is used to compare the predictive ability of this model to that of the ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP) method involving only either the main marker effects or the population-specific marker effects. We used a maize (Zea mays L.) data set with 312 genotypes derived from five biparental populations, which were genotyped with 39,339 markers. A combined analysis incorporating genotypes for all the populations and hence using a larger training set was better than separate analyses for each population. Modeling the main plus the population-specific marker effects simultaneously improved predictive ability only slightly compared with modeling only the main marker effects. The performance of the RR-BLUP method was comparable to that of two regularization methods, namely the ridge regression and the elastic net, and was more accurate than that of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Overall, combining information from related populations and increasing the number of genotypes improved predictive ability, but further allowing for population-specific marker effects made minor improvement.",2012,Crop Science

Our results served as the basis for the understanding of the pathomechanism of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in otosclerosis. According to these observations, we have composed a potential model for SNHL in otosclerosis. We have planned the non-surgical treatment of early stage otosclerosis, which is based on a targeted biological medication. According to previous results, otosclerosis was established as a slow-virus infection bone disease with the potential etiological role of measles virus. However, the background of the susceptibility for measles virus remainded unclear.

Novel variants were detected at both mRNA and protein levels, their structures were described precisely. We have performed the histopathological and clinical classification of non-otosclerotic stapes fixations. According to patientsâ€˜ data and histological findings, we have assessed the prognostic and audiometric characteristics of these disorders.

Identification of cancer biomarkers of prognostic value using specific gene regulatory networks (GRN): a novel role of RAD51AP1 for ovarian and lung cancers,"To date, microarray analyses have led to the discovery of numerous individual 'molecular signatures' associated with specific cancers. However, there are serious limitations for the adoption of these multi-gene signatures in the clinical environment for diagnostic or prognostic testing as studies with more power need to be carried out. This may involve larger richer cohorts and more advanced analyses. In this study, we conduct analyses-based on gene regulatory network-to reveal distinct and common biomarkers across cancer types. Using microarray data of triple-negative and medullary breast, ovarian and lung cancers applied to a combination of glasso and Bayesian networks (BNs), we derived a unique network-containing genes that are uniquely involved: small proline-rich protein 1A (SPRR1A), follistatin like 1 (FSTL1), collagen type XII alpha 1 (COL12A1) and RAD51 associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1). RAD51AP1 and FSTL1 are significantly overexpressed in ovarian cancer patients but only RAD51AP1 is upregulated in lung cancer patients compared with healthy controls. The upregulation of RAD51AP1 was mirrored in the bloods of both ovarian and lung cancer patients, and Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots predicted poorer overall survival (OS) in patients with high expression of RAD51AP1. Suppression of RAD51AP1 by RNA interference reduced cell proliferation in vitro in ovarian (SKOV3) and lung (A549) cancer cells. This effect appears to be modulated by a decrease in the expression of mTOR-related genes and pro-metastatic candidate genes. Our data describe how an initial in silico approach can generate novel biomarkers that could potentially support current clinical practice and improve long-term outcomes.",2018,Carcinogenesis
Microbiota of the Major South Atlantic Reef Building Coral Mussismilia,"The Brazilian endemic scleractinian corals, genus Mussismilia, are among the main reef builders of the South Atlantic and are threatened by accelerating rates of disease. To better understand how holobiont microbial populations interact with corals during health and disease and to evaluate whether selective pressures in the holobiont or neutral assembly shape microbial composition, we have examined the microbiota structure of Mussismilia corals according to coral lineage, environment, and disease/health status. Microbiota of three Mussismilia species (Mussismilia harttii, Mussismilia hispida, and Mussismilia braziliensis) was compared using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and clone library analysis of coral fragments. Analysis of biological triplicates per Mussismilia species and reef site allowed assessment of variability among Mussismilia species and between sites for M. braziliensis. From 173,487 V6 sequences, 6,733 coral- and 1,052 water-associated operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were observed. M. braziliensis microbiota was more similar across reefs than to other Mussismilia species microbiota from the same reef. Highly prevalent OTUs were more significantly structured by coral lineage and were enriched in Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. Bacterial OTUs from healthy corals were recovered from a M. braziliensis skeleton sample at twice the frequency of recovery from water or a diseased coral suggesting the skeleton is a significant habitat for microbial populations in the holobiont. Diseased corals were enriched with pathogens and opportunists (Vibrios, Bacteroidetes, Thalassomonas, and SRB). Our study examines for the first time intra- and inter-specific variability of microbiota across the genus Mussismilia. Changes in microbiota may be useful indicators of coral health and thus be a valuable tool for coral reef management and conservation.",2014,Microbial Ecology
Learning and Recovery in the ReLU Model,"Rectified linear units, or ReLUs, have become a preferred activation function for artificial neural networks. In this paper we consider two basic learning problems assuming that the underlying data follow a generative model based on a simple network with ReLU activations. The first problem we study corresponds to learning a generative model in the presence of nonlinearity (modeled by the ReLU functions). Given a set of signal vectors $\mathrm {y}^{i} \in \mathbb {R}^{d}, i = 1, 2,\ldots, n$, we aim to learn the network parameters, i.e., the $d\times k$ matrix $A$, under the model $\mathrm {y}^{i}=\mathrm {R}\mathrm {e}\mathrm {L}\mathrm {U}(A\mathrm {c}^{i}+\mathrm {b})$, where $\mathrm {b}\in \mathbb {R}^{d}$ is a random bias vector. We show that it is possible to recover the column space of $A$ within an error of $O(d)$ (in Frobenius norm) under certain conditions on the distribution of b.The second problem we consider is that of robust recovery of the signal in the presence of outliers. In this setting, we are interested in recovering the latent vector c from its noisy nonlinear images of the form $\mathrm {v}=\mathrm {ReLU}(A\mathrm {c})+\mathrm {e}+\mathrm {w}$, where $\mathrm {e}\in \mathbb {R}^{d}$ denotes the outliers with sparsity $s$ and $\mathrm {w}\in \mathbb {R}^{d}$ denote the dense but small noise. We show that the LASSO algorithm recovers $\mathrm {c} \in \mathbb {R}^{k}$ within an $\ell _{2}$-error of $O(\sqrt {((k+s)\log d)}/d)$ when $A$ is a random Gaussian matrix.",2019,"2019 57th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)"
"Incubation and brooding performance of the Antarctic Petrel Thalassoica antarctica at Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land","Antarctic Petrel Thalassoica antarctica incubation and brooding effort was studied at Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land, during the austral summer of 1991â€“1992. The females probably left the nest site shortly after egg laying. The duration of incubation and brooding shifts as well as the daily weight loss (absolute and proportionate) were comparable with those of other similar-sized procellariform species. Males spent more time incubating and brooding than did females, suggesting higher female energy stress due to egg laying. Incubating birds which were below average weight were likely to desert the nests before their mates returned from feeding trips. Both males and females lost approximately one-fifth of their body-weight during their first incubation shifts. Nevertheless, they increased their initial weights from egg laying to hatching and had their highest initial weights when they returned to start the shift during which the egg hatched. No factors related to adult body-weight explained the duration of the incubation shifts. Both males and females gained weight at a higher rate when at sea than they lost it during incubation, and it is suggested that factors unrelated to food availability or individual feeding skills may be important in regulating the duration of the incubation shifts and the stay at sea.",2008,Ibis
Smoothing proximal gradient method for general structured sparse regression,"We study the problem of estimating high-dimensional regression models regularized by a structured sparsity-inducing penalty that encodes prior structural information on either the input or output variables. We consider two widely adopted types of penalties of this kind as motivating examples: (1) the general overlapping-group-lasso penalty, generalized from the group-lasso penalty; and (2) the graph-guided-fused-lasso penalty, generalized from the fused-lasso penalty. For both types of penalties, due to their nonseparability and nonsmoothness, developing an efficient optimization method remains a challenging problem. In this paper we propose a general optimization approach, the smoothing proximal gradient (SPG) method, which can solve structured sparse regression problems with any smooth convex loss under a wide spectrum of structured sparsity-inducing penalties. Our approach combines a smoothing technique with an effective proximal gradient method. It achieves a convergence rate significantly faster than the standard first-order methods, subgradient methods, and is much more scalable than the most widely used interior-point methods. The efficiency and scalability of our method are demonstrated on both simulation experiments and real genetic data sets.",2012,The Annals of Applied Statistics
Estimating average treatment effects with a double-index propensity score.,"We consider estimating average treatment effects (ATE) of a binary treatment in observational data when data-driven variable selection is needed to select relevant covariates from a moderately large number of available covariates X. To leverage covariates among X predictive of the outcome for efficiency gain while using regularization to fit a parameteric propensity score (PS) model, we consider a dimension reduction of X based on fitting both working PS and outcome models using adaptive LASSO. A novel PS estimator, the Double-index Propensity Score (DiPS), is proposed, in which the treatment status is smoothed over the linear predictors for X from both the initial working models. The ATE is estimated by using the DiPS in a normalized inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimator, which is found to maintain double-robustness and also local semiparametric efficiency with a fixed number of covariates p. Under misspecification of working models, the smoothing step leads to gains in efficiency and robustness over traditional doubly-robust estimators. These results are extended to the case where p diverges with sample size and working models are sparse. Simulations show the benefits of the approach in finite samples. We illustrate the method by estimating the ATE of statins on colorectal cancer risk in an electronic medical record (EMR) study and the effect of smoking on C-reactive protein (CRP) in the Framingham OffspringÂ Study.

Reproductive ecology of interior least tern and piping plover in relation to Platte River hydrology and sandbar dynamics,"Investigations of breeding ecology of interior least tern (Sternula antillarum athalassos) and piping plover (Charadrius melodus) in the Platte River basin in Nebraska, USA, have embraced the idea that these species are physiologically adapted to begin nesting concurrent with the cessation of spring floods. Low use and productivity on contemporary Platte River sandbars have been attributed to anthropomorphically driven changes in basin hydrology and channel morphology or to unusually late annual runoff events. We examined distributions of least tern and piping plover nest initiation dates in relation to the hydrology of the historical central Platte River (CPR) and contemporary CPR and lower Platte River (LPR). We also developed an emergent sandbar habitat model to evaluate the potential for reproductive success given observed hydrology, stage-discharge relationships, and sandbar height distributions. We found the timing of the late-spring rise to be spatially and temporally consistent, typically occurring in mid-June. However, piping plover nest initiation peaks in May and least tern nest initiation peaks in early June; both of which occur before the late spring rise. In neither case does there appear to be an adaptation to begin nesting concurrent with the cessation of spring floods. As a consequence, there are many years when no successful reproduction is possible because emergent sandbar habitat is inundated after most nests have been initiated, and there is little potential for successful renesting. The frequency of nest inundation, in turn, severely limits the potential for maintenance of stable species subpopulations on Platte River sandbars. Why then did these species expand into and persist in a basin where the hydrology is not ideally suited to their reproductive ecology? We hypothesize the availability and use of alternative off-channel nesting habitats, like sandpits, may allow for the maintenance of stable species subpopulations in the Platte River basin.",2017,Ecology and Evolution
Square-Root Lasso With Nonconvex Regularization: An ADMM Approach,"Square-root least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), a variant of Lasso, has recently been proposed with a key advantage that the optimal regularization parameter is independent of the noise level in the measurements. In this letter, we introduce a class of nonconvex sparsity-inducing penalties to the square-root Lasso to achieve better sparse recovery performance over the convex counterpart. The resultant formulation is converted to a nonconvex but multiconvex optimization problem, i.e., it is convex in each block of variables. Alternating direction method of multipliers is applied as the solver, according to which two efficient algorithms are devised for row-orthonormal sensing matrix and general sensing matrix, respectively. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods.",2016,IEEE Signal Processing Letters
Surveying and comparing simultaneous sparse approximation (or group-lasso) algorithms,"In this paper, we survey and compare different algorithms that, given an overcomplete dictionary of elementary functions, solve the problem of simultaneous sparse signal approximation, with common sparsity profile induced by a @?""p-@?""q mixed-norm. Such a problem is also known in the statistical learning community as the group lasso problem. We have gathered and detailed different algorithmic results concerning these two equivalent approximation problems. We have also enriched the discussion by providing relations between several algorithms. Experimental comparisons of the detailed algorithms have also been carried out. The main lesson learned from these experiments is that depending on the performance measure, greedy approaches and iterative reweighted algorithms are the most efficient algorithms either in term of computational complexities, sparsity recovery or mean-square error.",2011,Signal Process.
Sparse Boosting with Correlation Based Penalty,"In high dimensional setting, componentwise L 2boosting method has been used to construct sparse model of high prediction, but it tends to select many ineffective variables. Several sparse boosting methods, such as, SparseL 2Boosting and Twin Boosting, have been proposed to improve the variable selection of L 2boosting algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new general sparse boosting method (GSBoosting). The relations are established between GSBoosting and other well known regularized variable selection methods in orthogonal linear model, such as adaptive Lasso, hard thresholds etc. Simulations results show that GSBoosting has good performance in both prediction and variable selection.",2012,
Correlation Research of Centralities on Complex Network by Statistical Learning,"In network theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality identify the most important vertices on complex networks. In this paper, we perform analysis on correlations of 13 centralities on ER random network and research how the Radial centralities interpret the Medial centralities adequately by statistical learning approaches such as linear regression, forwardand backward-stepwise selection and lasso. As a result, it is illustrated that some centralities on ER random networks with different connecting probability p always display strong correlations, and the Medial centrality can be interpreted by the Radial centralities. Furthermore, the linear regression is used to fit the relationship and retain some centralities to describe a medial centrality in our example, which will help to solve the problem that a centrality we donâ€™t have a ready algorithm and compute difficultly. The methods proposed by statistical learning provide an alternative way to obtain better understanding of the centralities and reveal the relationship among them. Introduction The study of random networks started with the influential work of ErdÃ¶s and RÃ©nyi in the 1950s and 1960s. In the study the assumption has been made that the presence or absence of an edge between two vertices is independent with the presence or absence of any other edge, so that each edge may be considered to be present with independent probability p. If there are N vertices in a network, and each is connected to an average of z edges, it is easy to show that p=z/(N-1), which for lager N is usually approximated by z/N[1]. The number of edges connected to any particular vertex is called the degree k of that vertex, and has a probability distribution pk given by (1 ) , ! k z k N k k N z e p p p k k ï€­ ï€­ ïƒ¦ ïƒ¶ ï€½ ï€­ ï‚» ïƒ§ ïƒ· ïƒ¨ ïƒ¸ (1) where the second equality becomes exact in the limit of lager N. To view a complex network, a direct way is to identify the most influential nodes and many centralities are proposed to locate important ones. Degree centrality of a node v is the fraction of nodes it is connected to. Closeness centrality of a node u is the reciprocal of the average shortest path distance to u over n-1 reachable nodes. Betweenness centrality of a node v is the sum of the fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through v. Eigenvector centrality computes the centrality for a node based on the centrality of its neighbors. PageRank computes a ranking of the nodes in the network G based on the structure of the incoming links. It was originally designed as an algorithm to rank web pages. Till now, there are hundreds of ways to define the centralities. The centrality can be classified into Radial or Medial classes according to its construction. Centralities are Radial centralities counting walks which start/end from the given vertex[2][3]. The degree and eigenvector centralities are examples of radial centralities. Medial centralities count walks which pass through the given vertex. The canonical example is betweenness centrality, counting the number of shortest paths which pass through the given vertex.",2018,DEStech Transactions on Computer Science and Engineering

Taming the Factor Zoo: A Test of New Factors,"We propose a model-selection method to systematically evaluate the contribution to asset pricing of any new factor, above and beyond what a high-dimensional set of existing factors explains. Our methodology explicitly accounts for potential model-selection mistakes, unlike the standard approaches that assume perfect variable selection, which rarely occurs in practice and produces a bias due to the omitted variables. We apply our procedure to a set of factors recently discovered in the literature. While most of these new factors are found to be redundant relative to the existing factors, a few â€” such as profitability â€” have statistically significant explanatory power beyond the hundreds of factors proposed in the past. In addition, we show that our estimates and their significance are stable, whereas the model selected by simple LASSO is not.",2017,National Bureau of Economic Research

Does generalization performance of lq regularization learning depend on q? A negative example,"$l^q$-regularization has been demonstrated to be an attractive technique in machine learning and statistical modeling. It attempts to improve the generalization (prediction) capability of a machine (model) through appropriately shrinking its coefficients. The shape of a $l^q$ estimator differs in varying choices of the regularization order $q$. In particular, $l^1$ leads to the LASSO estimate, while $l^{2}$ corresponds to the smooth ridge regression. This makes the order $q$ a potential tuning parameter in applications. To facilitate the use of $l^{q}$-regularization, we intend to seek for a modeling strategy where an elaborative selection on $q$ is avoidable. In this spirit, we place our investigation within a general framework of $l^{q}$-regularized kernel learning under a sample dependent hypothesis space (SDHS). For a designated class of kernel functions, we show that all $l^{q}$ estimators for $0< q < \infty$ attain similar generalization error bounds. These estimated bounds are almost optimal in the sense that up to a logarithmic factor, the upper and lower bounds are asymptotically identical. This finding tentatively reveals that, in some modeling contexts, the choice of $q$ might not have a strong impact in terms of the generalization capability. From this perspective, $q$ can be arbitrarily specified, or specified merely by other no generalization criteria like smoothness, computational complexity, sparsity, etc..",2013,ArXiv
"Deconvolving distribution of relaxation times, resistances and inductance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy via statistical model selection: Exploiting structural-sparsity regularization and data-driven parameter tuning","Abstract The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) has drawn increasing attention for interpreting electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Deconvolution of DRT from EIS is a challenging ill-posed problem that requires regularization methods. In this work, we formulate DRT reconstruction task as a statistical model selection problem with structural-sparsity penalties. We utilize the Elastic net regularization that simultaneously benefits from Ridge and Lasso regularizations with optimal tuning parameter automatically determined by the information criteria. We benchmark our approach on four synthetic experiments (a ZARC element, ZARC mixtures, a RC circuit and a Fractal element) and two real EIS datasets of a Lithium ion battery and an organic-inorganic halide class of perovskites in oxygen environment at different gas pressures. We demonstrate the superiority of proposed model selection procedure, that is capable of eliminating pseudo peaks and representing asymmetries in DRT as well as precisely estimating resistances. We highlight our approach is robust to reducing and subsampling EIS frequency range, making it a promising tool for timing-resolved, localized and large scale EIS data analysis. For the Lithium ion battery data analysis, we extend the classical DRT model to incorporate the inductive effect and illustrate DRT as a guidance for equivalent circuit modeling to refine impedance reconstruction at low risks of overfitting. Furthermore, the structural-sparsity regularization could be extended for multidimensional and Bayesian EIS data analysis.",2019,Electrochimica Acta

Regularization and feature selection for large dimensional data.,"Feature selection has evolved to be an important step in several machine learning paradigms. In domains like bio-informatics and text classification which involve data of high dimensions, feature selection can help in drastically reducing the feature space. In cases where it is difficult or infeasible to obtain sufficient number of training examples, feature selection helps overcome the curse of dimensionality which in turn helps improve performance of the classification algorithm. The focus of our research here are five embedded feature selection methods which use either the ridge regression, or Lasso regression, or a combination of the two in the regularization part of the optimization function. We evaluate five chosen methods on five large dimensional datasets and compare them on the parameters of sparsity and correlation in the datasets and their execution times.",2019,arXiv: Learning
