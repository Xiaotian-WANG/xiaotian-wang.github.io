Robust sketching for multiple square-root LASSO problems,"Many learning tasks, such as cross-validation, parameter search, or leave-one-out analysis, involve multiple instances of similar problems, each instance sharing a large part of learning data with the others. We introduce a robust framework for solving multiple square-root LASSO problems, based on a sketch of the learning data that uses low-rank approximations. Our approach allows a dramatic reduction in computational effort, in effect reducing the number of observations from $m$ (the number of observations to start with) to $k$ (the number of singular values retained in the low-rank model), while not sacrificing---sometimes even improving---the statistical performance. Theoretical analysis, as well as numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data, illustrate the efficiency of the method in large scale applications.",2015,ArXiv
"New host records of three Kudoa spp. (K. yasunagai, K. thalassomi, and K. igami) with notable variation in the number of shell valves and polar capsules in spores","To date, 26 Kudoa spp. (Myxozoa: Myxosporea: Multivalvulida) have been recorded in edible marine fishes in Japan. In the future, it is likely that even more marine fish multivalvulid myxosporeans will be characterized morphologically and genetically, which will aid the precise understanding of their biodiversity and biology. We examined 60 individuals of six fish species collected from the Philippine Sea off Kochi or from the border between the Philippine Sea and East China Sea around Miyako Island, Okinawa, i.e., the southern part of Japan. Newly collected parasite species included Kudoa yasunagai from the brain of Japanese meagre (Argyrosomus japonicus) and Japanese parrotfish (Calotomus japonicus), Kudoa miyakoensis n. sp. and Kudoa thalassomi from the brain and trunk muscle, respectively, of bluespine unicornfish (Naso unicornis), and Kudoa igami from the trunk muscle of Carolines parrotfish (Calotomus carolinus), African coris (Coris gaimard), and Pastel ringwrasse (Hologymnosus doliatus). With the exception of Japanese parrotfish for K. yasunagai, all these fish are new host records for each kudoid species. Notable variation in the number of shell valves (SV) and polar capsules (PC) was observed for all four kudoid species. In particular, spores with seven or eight SV/PC were prominent in K. igami isolates, despite the original Japanese parrotfish-derived description characterizing it as having spores with six, or less commonly five, SV/PC. However, molecular genetic characterization based on the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 and ribosomal RNA small and large subunits) found no significant differences in the nucleotide sequences of isolates with different phenotypical features as far as examined in the present study. A newly erected species, K. miyakoensis n. sp., was determined to be phylogenetically closest to brain-parasitizing species, such as K. chaetodoni, K. lemniscati, and K. yasunagai based on rDNA nucleotide sequences, but differed from them morphologically.",2018,Parasitology Research
Multicentre prospective evaluation of real-time optical diagnosis of T1 colorectal cancer in large non-pedunculated colorectal polyps using narrow band imaging (the OPTICAL study),"Objective This study evaluated the preresection accuracy of optical diagnosis of T1 colorectal cancer (CRC) in large non-pedunculated colorectal polyps (LNPCPs). Design In this multicentre prospective study, endoscopists predicted the histology during colonoscopy in consecutive patients with LNPCPs using a standardised procedure for optical assessment. The presence of morphological features assessed with white light, and vascular and surface pattern with narrow-band imaging (NBI) were recorded, together with the optical diagnosis, the confidence level of prediction and the recommended treatment. A risk score chart was developed and validated using a multivariable mixed effects binary logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection (LASSO) model. Results Among 343 LNPCPs, 47 cancers were found (36â€‰T1 CRCs and 11 â‰¥T2 CRCs), of which 11â€‰T1 CRCs were superficial invasive T1 CRCs (23.4% of all malignant polyps). Sensitivity and specificity for optical diagnosis of T1 CRC were 78.7% (95% CI 64.3 to 89.3) and 94.2% (95% CI 90.9 to 96.6), and 63.3% (95% CI 43.9 to 80.1) and 99.0% (95% CI 97.1 to 100.0) for optical diagnosis of endoscopically unresectable lesions (ie, â‰¥T1â€‰CRC with deep invasion), respectively. A LASSO-derived model using white light and NBI features discriminated T1 CRCs from non-invasive polyps with a cross-validation area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.90). This model was validated in a temporal validation set of 100 LNPCPs (AUC of 0.81; 95%â€‰CI 0.66 to 0.96). Conclusion Our study provides insights in the preresection accuracy of optical diagnosis of T1 CRC. Sensitivity is still limited, so further studies will show how the risk score chart could be improved and finally used for clinical decision making with regard to the type of endoresection to be used and whether to proceed to surgery instead of endoscopy.

A Comparison of Screening Methods for High Dimensional Input Problems,"History matching studies can involve adjusting a high number of reservoir uncertain parameters. Sensitivity analysis can help reservoir engineers focusing on the most influential parameters to prioritize the effort thus reducing sensibly the history matching time. However, due to nonlinear and interactions effects and depending on the method used, this exercise can be misleading or in some cases very time consuming. In this work, several statistical nonparametric methods from the most recent to the most classical have been implemented and tested on some typical oil reservoir applications. Different tests are made using different problems of different dimension. Most of the nonparametric methods investigated are based on response surfaces such as kriging, polynomial or smoothing splines responses with different types of penalization (LASSO, COSSO,...), and some others are issued from the recent statistical literature. The response surface methods were tested using space filling experimental design such as maximin latin hypercube. In the comparisons the computational cpu time for each method is also reported because even if these are generally negligible respect to large simulation time, they can be considerable for large dimensional input problems. To assess the quality of the methods several criteria have been used such as the prediction accuracy of the response surfaces, but also other criteria such as the number of times the method fails to detect an influential parameter (type 1 errors) or the number of times it indicates a non influential parameter as influential (type 2 errors). Numerical tests were made on different outputs (objective functions) of realistic synthetic reservoir models.",2010,
Paradigm free mapping : detection and characterization of single trial fMRI BOLD responses without prior stimulus information,"The increased contrast to noise ratio available at Ultrahigh (7T) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) allows mapping in space and time the brain's response to single trial events with functional MRI (fMRI) based on the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast. This thesis primarily concerns with the development of techniques to detect and characterize single trial event-related BOLD responses without prior paradigm information, Paradigm Free Mapping, and assess variations in BOLD sensitivity across brain regions at high field fMRI.

Based on a linear haemodynamic response model, Paradigm Free Mapping (PFM) techniques rely on the deconvolution of the neuronal-related signal driving the BOLD effect using regularized least squares estimators. The first approach, named PFM, builds on the ridge regression estimator and spatio-temporal t-statistics to detect statistically significant changes in the deconvolved fMRI signal. The second method, Sparse PFM, benefits from subset selection features of the LASSO and Dantzig Selector estimators that automatically detect the single trial BOLD responses by promoting a sparse deconvolution of the signal. The third technique, Multicomponent PFM, exploits further the benefits of sparse estimation to decompose the fMRI signal into a haemodynamical component and a baseline component using the morphological component analysis algorithm.

These techniques were evaluated in simulations and experimental fMRI datasets, and the results were compared with well-established fMRI analysis methods. In particular, the methods developed here enabled the detection of single trial BOLD responses to visually-cued and self-paced finger tapping responses without prior information of the events. The potential application of Sparse PFM to identify interictal discharges in idiopathic generalized epilepsy was also investigated. Furthermore, Multicomponent PFM allowed us to extract cardiac and respiratory fluctuations of the signal without the need of physiological monitoring. 

To sum up, this work demonstrates the feasibility to do single trial fMRI analysis without prior stimulus or physiological information using PFM techniques.",2010,

In particular, variations in manner of pair formation and pair bond length, in geographic distribution and ecology, and the related conditions of aiiopatry or sympairy with other species are discussed and their probable effects on behaviour are suggested. Instances are mentioned where a knowledge of behaviour would be helpful in judging evolutionary relationships that have thus far eluded taxonomists (e.g., Stictonetta, Heteronetia, Thalassorms), and likewise examples are pointed out where behavioural evidence suggests different relationships from tnose which are currently accepted (e.g., â€œ Lophonetta,"" â€œ Anas â€ leucoplirys, and the eiders).",1959,
GCRNN: Group-Constrained Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network,"In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end deep neural network model for time-series classification (TSC) with emphasis on both the accuracy and the interpretation. The proposed model contains a convolutional network component to extract high-level features and a recurrent network component to enhance the modeling of the temporal characteristics of TS data. In addition, a feedforward fully connected network with the sparse group lasso (SGL) regularization is used to generate the final classification. The proposed architecture not only achieves satisfying classification accuracy, but also obtains good interpretability through the SGL regularization. All these networks are connected and jointly trained in an end-to-end framework, and it can be generally applied to TSC tasks across different domains without the efforts of feature engineering. Our experiments in various TS data sets show that the proposed model outperforms the traditional convolutional neural network model for the classification accuracy, and also demonstrate how the SGL contributes to a better model interpretation.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems

Variable Selection and Coefficient Estimation via Regularized Rank Regression,"The penalized least squares method with some appropriately defined penalty is widely used for simultaneous variable selection and coefficient estimation in linear regression. However, the efficiency of least squares (LS) based methods is adversely affected by outlying observations and heavy tailed distributions. On the other hand, the least absolute deviation (LAD) estimator is more robust, but may be inefficient for many distributions of interest. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel method termed the regularized rank regression (R 3 ) estimator. It is shown that the proposed estimator is highly efficient across a wide spectrum of error distributions. We show further that when the adaptive LASSO penalty is used, the estimator can be made consistent in variable selection. We propose using a score statistic-based information criterion for choosing the tuning parameters, which bypasses density estimation. Simulations and data analysis both show that the proposed method performs well in finite sample cases.",2010,
Treatment strategy of early recurrence of atrial fibrillation after segmental pulmonary veins isolation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,"Objective To investigate the treatment strategy of early recurrence of atrial fibrillation (ERAF) after segmental pulmonary veins isolation (PVI) in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) Methods Segmental pulmonary veins isolation was performed using radiofrequency energy in 66 consecutive patients with recurrent documented symptomatic paroxysmal AF (Male: 50; mean age: 55Â±17 years) After unselective/selective angiography data of all pulmonary veins (PV) were obtained, Lasso mapping catheter and ablation catheter were positioned into target pulmonary vein ostium We routinely mapped the four PVs and the superior vena cava lest any foci that triggered Paroxysmal AF should be omitted RF power: 25-35 W; temperature: 50-55â„ƒ Results Of the 66 patients 219 PVs were targeted for segmental RF ablation, and 210 PVs were isolated completely Immediate success rate was 96% Early recurrence of AF occurred in 26 of the 66 patients (39 3%) within two weeks after PVI An early repeat ablation was attempted in 9 patients (repeat ablation group) A second approach demonstrated either new foci in left atrial posterior free wall ( n =2) or recurrence of previously isolated PVs ( n =9) The other 17 patients were treated with class â…  or â…¢ of antiarrhythmic drugs (drug control group) Long term success was achieved in 5 of 9 patients (55 6%) in repeat ablation group, and in 6 of 17 patients (35 3%) in drug control group in the mean 10Â±6 months of follow up, P 0 05 There was 1 case of cardiac tamponand and 1 case of 60% stenosis of the left superior PV associated with the procedure Conclusion ERAF after segmental PV isolation is common, occurring in approximately 39% of patients with paroxysmal AF However, approximately 35% of ERAF patients without early repeat ablation have no further AF during long term follow up It is suggested that temporary antiarrhymic drug therapy may be more appropriate than early repeat ablation in patients with ERAF",2004,Chinese Journal of Interventional Cardiology

"Palynological Evidence for Late Cretaceous Unconformity in Wh-1 Well Offshore Eastern Benin Basin, Sw Nigeria","The onshore Eastern Benin Basin is well studied and abundant data with respect to its geology and mineral resources are well known. However, unavailability of published data on the offshore is inhibiting exploration efforts in the area. To contribute to present knowledge, cuttings from an offshore well, â€˜WH-1â€™ was studied for palynostratigraphy. Sub-samples of cuttings were subjected to standard palynological and sedimentological preparation techniques. Characteristic palynomorph features include: occurrence of Canningia cf. senonica and Nelsoniella ; and presence of Microdinium ornatum (dinoflagellates). Recovered sporomorphs include Crybelosporites pannuceus and Cicatricosisporites spp. (spores), and Classopollis spp . and Ephedripites (pollen). The above assemblages suggest a late Cenomanian age for the lowermost section while the occurrences of Lejeunecysta hyaline, Selenopemphix selenoides and Hystrichokolpoma rigudae (dinoflagellates) and Peregrinipollis nigericus, Retitricolporites irregularis and Ctenolophonidites costatus (pollen) and Foveotriletes margaritae (spore) at the uppermost section indicate an Eocene age. Lithologically, the basal sequence is composed of poorly sorted sandstones with variable interbeds of shales and siltstones overlain by dark grey shales and interbedded limestones with occasional pyrite occurrence (Abeokuta-Afowo Formations). Overlying this is a glauconitic sequence consisting of shale with little clay and lenses of limestones (Araromi Formation). The uppermost part is composed entirely of shales with some glauconitic materials (Oshosun Formation) . Three main unconformities were identified with suspected loss of Turonian, Coniacian, lower Santonian, as well as the upper and middle Maastrichtian sections",2015,
Discovery and Replication of Gene Influences on Brain Structure Using LASSO Regression,"We implemented least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to evaluate gene effects in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of brain images, using an MRI-derived temporal lobe volume measure from 729 subjects scanned as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Sparse groups of SNPs in individual genes were selected by LASSO, which identifies efficient sets of variants influencing the data. These SNPs were considered jointly when assessing their association with neuroimaging measures. We discovered 22 genes that passed genome-wide significance for influencing temporal lobe volume. This was a substantially greater number of significant genes compared to those found with standard, univariate GWAS. These top genes are all expressed in the brain and include genes previously related to brain function or neuropsychiatric disorders such as MACROD2, SORCS2, GRIN2B, MAGI2, NPAS3, CLSTN2, GABRG3, NRXN3, PRKAG2, GAS7, RBFOX1, ADARB2, CHD4, and CDH13. The top genes we identified with this method also displayed significant and widespread post hoc effects on voxelwise, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) maps of the temporal lobes. The most significantly associated gene was an autism susceptibility gene known as MACROD2. We were able to successfully replicate the effect of the MACROD2 gene in an independent cohort of 564 young, Australian healthy adult twins and siblings scanned with MRI (mean age: 23.8â€‰Â±â€‰2.2 SD years). Our approach powerfully complements univariate techniques in detecting influences of genes on the living brain.",2012,Frontiers in Neuroscience
[Do commercial sex workers who discuss treatment with family and friends adhere to it better?].,"INTRODUCTION
The number of HIV trials in Africa is increasing, and they target population groups with high HIV incidence, such as sex workers. Little information, however, is available about the adherence to long-term therapy among such marginalized groups with few economic resources and poor social and family support. A project called ""Yerelon"" (""know herself"" in the Dioula language) began in 1998 in Bobo-Dioulasso to improve the health of women involved in commercial sex through STI/HIV prevention and care adapted to them. This study was conducted before introducing long-term treatment to the population, to assess the effect of communication with those around them on the capacity of these vulnerable women to adhere to drug prescriptions.


METHODS
The study was based on interviews conducted during the pilot phase of a 3-month trial of vitamins with potential participants. It concerned two groups of women: one group was infected with HIV (N = 22), the other was not (N = 20); all women in both groups were infected by HSV-2, however. For 5 weeks, the two psychologists of the study team in charge of adherence assessment carried out weekly in-depth interviews with the participants. The qualitative data analysis was organised around several themes. The data were related to aspects of communication with family and friends, serologic results, and adherence.


RESULTS
According to our definition of communication about treatment, 20 participants communicated with their family and friends; adherence was good for all but three of them. Women who reported that they were married or living with someone (7/42) nearly all spoke about the study treatment (06/07) with him. Of 16 participants living in a family, 10 communicated with them about the treatment. On the other hand, as seems logical, single women who lived alone spoke less often about the treatment with family and friends (04/19). Talking about the treatment did not appear to involve the family or friends in the treatment; no one reminded any participant, whether she lived alone or in a family, to take her medicine. Nor did this discussion seem ""helpful"" to any of the women. Twenty-two participants hid the study treatment from family and friends; adherence was good for all but two of these. Social management of the treatment was related to HIV serologic status and relationships with family and friends. Concern about gossip about HIV status made it difficult to integrate the treatment into conversation. Those who did not agree to communicate with their family about the treatment did not even take the drug in the sight of the others. Sometimes, refusal to communicate was aimed at avoiding disapproval when the family did not have a favorable perception of prolonged treatment. Hiding the treatment was not an obstacle to good adherence. Adherence was related to perception of the treatment more than to communication about it.


CONCLUSION
Adherence was similar in cases with and without communication. It appeared that these marginalized women, without social networks, were able to adhere correctly to a long-term treatment. To minimize the risks of non-adherence, the support system planned must take into account the factors influencing perceptions of the drug. Specific psychological support centered on the relation with the drug appears necessary during treatment initiation and follow up.",2009,Sante
Submitted to the Annals of Statistics PREDICTION ERROR AFTER MODEL SEARCH By Xiaoying,"Estimation of the prediction error of a linear estimation rule is difficult if the data analyst also use data to select a set of variables and construct the estimation rule using only the selected variables. In this work, we propose an asymptotically unbiased estimator for the prediction error after model search. Under some additional mild assumptions, we show that our estimator converges to the true prediction error in L at the rate of O(nâˆ’1/2), with n being the number of data points. Our estimator applies to general selection procedures, not requiring analytical forms for the selection. The number of variables to select from can grow as an exponential factor of n, allowing applications in high-dimensional data. It also allows model misspecifications, not requiring linear underlying models. One application of our method is that it provides an estimator for the degrees of freedom for many discontinuous estimation rules like best subset selection or relaxed Lasso. Connection to Steinâ€™s Unbiased Risk Estimator is discussed. We consider in-sample prediction errors in this work, with some extension to out-of-sample errors in low dimensional, linear models. Examples such as best subset selection and relaxed Lasso are considered in simulations, where our estimator outperforms both Cp and cross validation in various settings.",2017,
Topics in High-Dimensional Statistics and the Analysis of Large Hyperspectral Images.,"Advancement in imaging technology has made hyperspectral images gathered from remote sensing much more common. The high-dimensional nature of these large scale data coupled with wavelength and spatial dependency necessitates high-dimensional and efficient computation methods to address these issues while producing results that are concise and easy to understand. The thesis addresses these issues by examining high-dimensional methods in the context of hyperspectral image classification, unmixing and wavelength correlation estimation. Chapter 2 re-examines the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) of linear models of [88] in a high-dimensional setting with sparse signal. The hardthresholded version of the SBL estimator, under orthogonal design, achieves non-asymptotic error rate that is comparable to LASSO of [87]. We also establish in the chapter that with high-probability the estimator recovers the sparsity structure of the signal. The ability to recover sparsity structures in high dimensional settings is crucial for unmixing with high-dimensional libraries in the next chapter. In Chapter 3, the thesis investigates the application of SBL on the task of linear/bilinear unmixing and classification of hyperspectral images. The proposed model in this chapter uses latent Markov random fields to classify pixels and account for the spatial dependence between pixels. In the proposed model, the pixels belonging to the same group share the same mixture of pure endmembers. The task of unmixing and classification",2016,

Leader selection via LASSO for formation control of time-delayed multi-agent systems,"Abstract In this paper, we address a formation control problem with velocity assignment of networked multi-agent systems with heterogeneous time-delays. We assume the situation that the assigned velocity is transmitted as a command signal from human operators via long-range communication. For the cost reduction, only a part of the agents, called leaders, can receive this signal. First, we show that heterogeneous time-delays cause a formation error, and derive the error in an analytic way. Second, we propose a leader selection algorithm to minimize the formation error. Here, a small number of leaders is better from the viewpoint of the cost reduction. To meet this request, we employ the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) which has a function of selecting as few explanatory variables as possible in optimization problems. We focus on this function of the LASSO, and consider applying it to the leader selection problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a numerical example.",2017,Neurocomputing
Matching quantiles estimation,"Motivated by a backtesting problem for counterparty credit risk management, we propose a new Matching Quantiles Estimation (MQE) method, for selecting representative portfolios. An iterative procedure based on the ordinary least squares estimation (LSE) is proposed to compute the MQE. The convergence of the algorithm and the asymptotic properties of the estimation are established. A new measure and an associated statistical test are proposed to assess the goodness-of-match. The finite sample properties are illustrated numerically by both simulation and a real data example on selecting a counterparty representative portfolio. The proposed MQE also finds applications in portfolio tracking, which demonstrates the potential usefulness of combing the MQE with the LASSO.",2013,
Inferring gene expression networks with hubs using a degree weighted Lasso approach,"Motivation Genomeâ€scale gene networks contain regulatory genes called hubs that have many interaction partners. These genes usually play an essential role in gene regulation and cellular processes. Despite recent advancements in highâ€throughput technology, inferring gene networks with hub genes from highâ€dimensional data still remains a challenging problem. Novel statistical network inference methods are needed for efficient and accurate reconstruction of hub networks from highâ€dimensional data. Results To address this challenge we propose DWâ€Lasso, a degree weighted Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method which infers gene networks with hubs efficiently under the low sample size setting. Our network reconstruction approach is formulated as a two stage procedure: first, the degree of networks is estimated iteratively, and second, the gene regulatory network is reconstructed using degree information. A useful property of the proposed method is that it naturally favors the accumulation of neighbors around hub genes and thereby helps in accurate modeling of the highâ€throughput data under the assumption that the underlying network exhibits hub structure. In a simulation study, we demonstrate good predictive performance of the proposed method in comparison to traditional Lasso type methods in inferring hub and scaleâ€free graphs. We show the effectiveness of our method in an application to microarray data of Escherichia coli and RNA sequencing data of Kidney Clear Cell Carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets.

"Eutardigrada: Distribution at Eniwetok Atoll, Marshall Islands","Six species of Eutardigrada were found at Eniwetok Atoll, representing two families (Macrobiotidae and Milnesiidae) and three genera (Hypsibius, Macrobiotus, and Milnesium). Hypsibius (Calohypsibius) truncatus was found in sand samples from the thalassosupralittoral fringe at Runit and Eniwetok islets. H. (Isohypsibius) augusti was found in sand of the thalassosupralittoral fringe on Engebi Islet. Macrobiottts allani was found on Muti Islet; M. harmsUlorthi on Bogallua, Engebi, Roijoa, Eniwetok, Muti, and Igurin islets; M. richtersi on Japtan and Muti islets; all three species from tree-borne lichens and mosses. Milnesium tardigradum was commonly recovered from lichens and mosses on Muti and Igurin islets. The total number of individuals collected was small compared to collections in the temperate zone. No morphological anomalies were noted. THE TARDIGRADE FAUNA of Micronesia has been neglected; the prime objective of this study, therefore, was to extend the range of collecting to provide more extensive data on tardigrade distribution, and the secondary objectives were to acquire specimens for long-term studies on comparative morphology, intraspecific variability, and life history.",1972,
Genomic Prediction of Growth and Stem Quality Traits in Eucalyptus globulus Labill. at Its Southernmost Distribution Limit in Chile,"The present study was undertaken to examine the ability of different genomic selection (GS) models to predict growth traits (diameter at breast height, tree height and wood volume), stem straightness and branching quality of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. trees using a genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) chip (60 K), in one of the southernmost progeny trials of the species, close to its southern distribution limit in Chile. The GS methods examined were Ridge Regression-BLUP (RRBLUP), Bayes-A, Bayes-B, Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (BLASSO), principal component regression (PCR), supervised PCR and a variant of the RRBLUP method that involves the previous selection of predictor variables (RRBLUP-B). RRBLUP-B and supervised PCR models presented the greatest predictive ability (PA), followed by the PCR method, for most of the traits studied. The highest PA was obtained for the branching quality (~0.7). For the growth traits, the maximum values of PA varied from 0.43 to 0.54, while for stem straightness, the maximum value of PA reached 0.62 (supervised PCR). The study population presented a more extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) than other populations of E. globulus previously studied. The genome-wide LD decayed rapidly within 0.76 Mbp (threshold value of r2 = 0.1). The average LD on all chromosomes was r2 = 0.09. In addition, the 0.15% of total pairs of linked SNPs were in a complete LD (r2 = 1), and the 3% had an r2 value >0.5.

"Identification and Heterologous Expression of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Encoding the Lasso Peptide Humidimycin, a Caspofungin Activity Potentiator","Humidimycin (MDN-0010) is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) belonging to class I lasso peptides, and is structurally related to siamycins, which have been shown to have strong antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria and to possess anti-HIV activity. Humidimycin was isolated from the strain Streptomyces humidus CA-100629, and was shown to synergize the activity of the fungal cell wall inhibitor caspofungin. In this work, the biosynthetic gene cluster of humidimycin was identified by genome mining of S. humidus CA-100629, cloned by Gibson assembly, and heterologously expressed.",2020,Antibiotics
"An unusual habitat for bivalves: rediscovery of the enigmatic commensal clam Sagamiscintilla thalassemicola (Habe, 1962) (Bivalvia: Galeommatoidea) from spoon wormâ€™s spoon","Sagamiscintilla thalassemicola (Bivalvia: Galeommatoidea: Galeommatidae sensu lato) is a white-robed commensal clam that lives on the body surface of spoon worms (Annelida: Echiura). This species was described based on specimens collected from the spoon worm Anelassorhynchus mucosus (Thalassematidae) in Amakusa, Kyushu, Japan, in 1962, but there has been no reliable record since the first description. Thus, some researchers suspected that this species may have become extinct. In this study, we rediscovered this species from the spoon-shaped proboscis of the echiuran Anelassorhynchus sp. in Shikoku and Kyushu Islands, Japan. Although the original description did not mention the details of its host use pattern, we found that this species lives almost exclusively within the proboscis gutter of the host, where it is almost hidden from the outside. Such a cryptic habitat is probably the reason why this species has remained undiscovered for over 50Â years. Living hidden in the host probosces probably provides an anti-predation benefit for S. thalassemicola. The host echiurans create ciliary water currents on the proboscis gutter to transfer food particles into the mouth, and the bivalves can utilize this water currents for respiration and filter feeding. Sagamiscinitlla thalassemicola is distinctive among ectocommensal galeommatoideans in having a mantle that fully covers the shell valves. It may be a morphological adaptation to protect the shell valves from sand and other hard particles transferred through the proboscis gutter of the host.",2018,Marine Biodiversity

Influence of Amelioration of Strongly Acid Soils with Calcareous Materials and Sewage Sludge on Wheat Yield and Economic Results,"Abstract The amelioration of acid unproductive soils with various amendments may improve soil properties and increase crop yield. In this paper, the influence of several soil amendments (refuse sugar beet lime, calcium hydroxide, and municipal sewage sludge) on wheat yield and gross margin were studied in a threeâ€year (1995, 1996, 1997) field experiment, conducted in western Thessaly (Elassona area), central Greece. In order to evaluate soil amelioration from an economic point of view we estimated the profit that derives from soil amelioration for each year separately as well as for the whole period of the experiment. The results showed that sugar beet lime and sewage sludge at the rate 15 ton haâˆ’1 are preferable from an economic point of view compared to calcium hydroxide. This fact is supportive of all the efforts made to diffuse the use of quality byâ€products for soil amelioration.",2005,Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis
Tunstall adaptive coding and miscoding,"In the first part of this paper, we tackle the case where a variable length-to-block Tunstall code is used to encode the wrong source (miscoding). It turns out that, exactly as happens in the case with Huffman coding, the asymptotic excess rate is given by the informational divergence between the probability distribution ruling the source and the probability distribution for which the Tunstall code had been devised. We also prove asymptotic equality between the individual rate of a codeword and the corresponding self-information. This allows us to bound the maximal and the minimal length in a Tunstall tree. In the second part of the paper we study the case where the probability distribution of the source changes in time. If this happens, it is necessary to frequently update the current code, to ensure that the optimality conditions concerning its rate are met. This coding procedure is known as adaptive coding. We propose some schemes for adaptive Tunstall coding, based on the structure of the coding tree, on the ""ordering property"", analogous to Gallager's (1978) sibling property of the Huffman code, and on the ""Tunstall regions"", analogous to the attraction regions due to Longo and Galasso (1982).",1996,IEEE Trans.

A Cost-Effective Transparency-Based Digital Imaging for Efficient and Accurate Wound Area Measurement,"Wound measurement is an objective and direct way to trace the course of wound healing and to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Nevertheless, the accuracy and efficiency of the current measurement methods need to be improved. Taking the advantages of reliability of transparency tracing and the accuracy of computer-aided digital imaging, a transparency-based digital imaging approach is established, by which data from 340 wound tracing were collected from 6 experimental groups (8 rats/group) at 8 experimental time points (Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14 and 16) and orderly archived onto a transparency model sheet. This sheet was scanned and its image was saved in JPG form. Since a set of standard area units from 1 mm(2) to 1 cm(2) was integrated into the sheet, the tracing areas in JPG image were measured directly, using the ""Magnetic lasso tool"" in Adobe Photoshop program. The pixel values/PVs of individual outlined regions were obtained and recorded in an average speed of 27 second/region. All PV data were saved in an excel form and their corresponding areas were calculated simultaneously by the formula of Y (PV of the outlined region)/X (PV of standard area unit) Ã— Z (area of standard unit). It took a researcher less than 3 hours to finish area calculation of 340 regions. In contrast, over 3 hours were expended by three skillful researchers to accomplish the above work with traditional transparency-based method. Moreover, unlike the results obtained traditionally, little variation was found among the data calculated by different persons and the standard area units in different sizes and shapes. Given its accurate, reproductive and efficient properties, this transparency-based digital imaging approach would be of significant values in basic wound healing research and clinical practice.",2012,PLoS ONE

Evaluating different sparsity measures for resolving LC/GC-MS data in the context of multivariate curve resolution,"Abstract Since mass spectra are sparse in nature, the â€œsparsityâ€ has been recently proposed as a constraint in multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) methods for analyzing LC/GC-MS data. There are different ways for implementation of sparsity constraint, and the majority of such methods rely on imposing a penalty term on the norms of recovered mass spectra. However, the main question is which penalty method is more appropriate for implementation of sparsity constraint in MCR methods. In order to address this question, two- and three-component LC/GC-MS data were simulated and used for the case study, in the work. The areas of feasible solutions (AFS) were calculated using the grid search and Nelder-Mead simplex algorithms. Moreover, different measures of sparsity such as L0-norm, L1-norm, and L2/L1 for all mass spectra in the AFSs were calculated and visualized as contour plots. The results revealed that all mentioned measures of sparsity find the sparsest solution in AFS. However, from the optimization point of view, L1-norm and L2/L1 are easier to implement than L0-norm. Approximation methods for solving L0-norm problem can take advantage of both unique solution and fast optimization. The results of L0-norm, L1-norm, and L2/L1 criteria were compared with other sparsity measures such as Shannon entropy, Hoyer, Kurtosis, and Gini indices. The results revealed that L1-norm sparsity measure coincides with L0-norm, Hoyer, Kurtosis, and Gini indices from the accuracy point of view. Finally, the feasibility of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) was assessed for implementation of L1-norm penalty and finding the sparsest solution in MCR. It was found that for small values of Î» parameter, Lasso is able to find the sparsest solution with the minimum sum of squares of errors. Thorough optimization of Î» is necessary for obtaining accurate results. The lasso-MCR-ALS algorithm was tested with the real GC-MS datasets related to the analysis of Iranian red jujube oil.",2020,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems
Risk factors for preterm delivery in Burkina Faso (west Africa).,"The environmental and socioeconomic risk factors for preterm delivery were assessed in a West African urban population (Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso). The study population were 102 cases of preterm delivery matched with 102 controls obtained from 4124 sequential deliveries which occurred between May and October 1989 in the three maternity centres in the city. The univariate analysis identified the risk factors as age (< 20 years), primiparity, marital status (single), low frequency of antenatal visits, death of a previous child and level of education of the mother. The following risk factors identified by multivariate analysis (logistic regression) are consistent with those identified in previous studies: youth of the mother, primiparity (P = 0.01) and death of a previous child (P < 0.05). On the other hand, in this study, the level of education of the parent was identified as an independent risk factor (P < 0.001). This finding could be used to determine a target population for prevention programmes.",1993,International journal of epidemiology

"Thalassobacillus devorans gen. nov., sp. nov., a moderately halophilic, phenol-degrading, Gram-positive bacterium.","A novel moderately halophilic bacterium, strain G-19.1(T), has been isolated from a phenol enrichment of samples collected in hypersaline habitats of southern Spain. This enrichment culture was a part of a screening programme to isolate halophilic bacteria able to degrade various aromatic compounds. Strain G-19.1(T) has been characterized as a potential phenol-degrader over a wide range of saline conditions. Strain G-19.1(T) was found to be an aerobic, Gram-positive, endospore-forming, non-pigmented, moderately halophilic rod that grew optimally in media containing 7.5-10% NaCl at pH 7.0. The DNA G+C content was 42.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the closest relatives were Halobacillus species (96.2-97.0%), although this novel isolate constitutes a separate line of descent within the radiation of Gram-positive rods. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, indicating that this strain does not share the main characteristic that differentiates members of the genus Halobacillus (which contain Orn-D-Asp) from other related genera. The predominant cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0), iso-C(16:0) and iso-C(15:0). On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic analyses, this isolate should be classified in a novel genus and species, for which the name Thalassobacillus devorans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain G-19.1(T) (=DSM 16966(T)=CECT 7046(T)=CCM 7282(T)).",2005,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Exploring Machine Learning to Correct Satellite-Derived Sea Surface Temperatures,"Machine learning techniques are attractive tools to establish statistical models with a high degree of non linearity. They require a large amount of data to be trained and are therefore particularly suited to analysing remote sensing data. This work is an attempt at using advanced statistical methods of machine learning to predict the bias between Sea Surface Temperature (SST) derived from infrared remote sensing and ground â€œtruthâ€ from drifting buoy measurements. A large dataset of collocation between satellite SST and in situ SST is explored. Four regression models are used: Simple multi-linear regression, Least Square Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Generalised Additive Model (GAM) and random forest. In the case of geostationary satellites for which a large number of collocations is available, results show that the random forest model is the best model to predict the systematic errors and it is computationally fast, making it a good candidate for operational processing. It is able to explain nearly 31% of the total variance of the bias (in comparison to about 24% for the multi-linear regression model).",2018,Remote Sensing
Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forssk.) Den Hartog: root structure and histochemistry in relation to apoplastic transport,"Abstract Root structure, histochemistry and apoplastic permeability were investigated in the seagrass Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forssk.) Den Hartog. The free space tracers Cellufluor and lanthanum nitrate were used to study apoplastic transport. Tracer penetration occurred only in a few actively growing primary roots near the rhizome tip and was restricted mainly to the anterior region of the root hair zone. The extent of penetration of tracers into tissues of these roots was governed by the stage of differentiation of the cells and the chemical composition of cell walls. Close to the root tip where walls were composed mainly of cellulose and were relatively unmodified, an apoplastic pathway existed from the external medium to the free space of vascular tissues. The presence of tracers in both the walls and lumens of xylem elements suggested that they were transported by these elements. With increase in distance from the root apex, cell walls of the epidermis, outer cortex and endodermis become modified by deposition of suberin and lignin. These wall modifications prevented apoplastic transport. Older roots which comprised more than 95% of the root system, possessed strongly lignified and suberized cell walls and were impermeable to the tracers. On the basis of the results obtained, it would seem that the main function of the roots is that of anchorage and support, with limited absorption and transport occurring via the apoplast.",1991,Aquatic Botany
THU0258 dRVVT and aPTT Ratios for Laboratory Detection of Lupus Anticoagulant â€“ To Normalize or Not To Normalize That Is The Question,"Background The laboratory testing of lupus anticoagulant (LA) is based on the guidelines given by ISTH-SSC and CLSI. Both guidelines advocate using diluted Russel viper venom (dRVVT) test in combination with activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay and the results should be expressed as ratio to the pooled normal plasma (PNP). Since reagents used for testing may differ between lots as well as between manufacturers, those guidelines recommend normalization of the results. However some authors suggest not using the normalization step to decrease the complexity of already very complicated LA testing. Objectives To investigate how the normalization of dRVVT and aPTT-ratios based on PNP reference values affects the reference ranges and the number of positive and negative results for the presence of LA. Methods Double centrifuged plasma samples from healthy subjects (N=49) were analyzed on Behring Coagulation System BCS XP. All samples were analyzed with the dRVVT-based assay, using LA screen and LA confirm from Life Diagnostics, as well as with aPTT assays - PTT-LA from Diagnostica Stago as screen and Actin FS from Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics as the confirm step. Ratios were calculated for both dRVTT and aPTT before and after normalization using mean of run-specific PNP value. Our laboratory reports the dRVVT-ratio and aPTTâ€“ratio as: negative 1.4. We also investigated 362 previously analyzed samples to figure out how the normalization step influences the results. Results Ratios for PNP were 1.06Â±0.01 and 1.26Â±0.02 for dRVVT and aPTT respectively. Out of 49 healthy subjects without the normalization step, 34 would have been reported as negative (15 as weakly positive) with dRVVT and 3 would have been reported as negative (8 as positive and 38 as weakly positive) with aPTT. After normalization 45 samples would have been reported as negative (3 and 1 as weakly positive with dRVVT and aPTT respectively). The normalization step led to a decrease in the amount of positive diagnosis (from 58% to 44% and 77% to 41% using dRVVT and aPTT respectively) and at the same time the number of samples tested negative increased (7% to 15% and 6% to 34% for dRVVT and aPTT respectively). Conclusions Our findings indicate that without the normalization step only 6% of healthy subjects would be reported as negative for the presence of LA. The introduction of the normalization step decreases the number of false positive results and this is particularly true for the aPTT based assay. Since false positive results lead not only to unnecessary patients9 discomfort, but also generate an increased cost due to prolonged follow up of the patients, an additional step using normalization which is relatively simple and inexpensive is definitely justified for the laboratory diagnosis of LA.

"The Group-Lasso: l1, INFINITY Regularization versus l1, 2 Regularization","The l1,âˆž norm and the l1,2 norm are well known tools for joint regularization in Group-Lasso methods. While the l1,2 version has been studied in detail, there are still open questions regarding the uniqueness of solutions and the efficiency of algorithms for the l1,âˆž variant. For the latter, we characterize the conditions for uniqueness of solutions, we present a simple test for uniqueness, and we derive a highly efficient active set algorithm that can deal with input dimensions in the millions. We compare both variants of the Group-Lasso for the two most common application scenarios of the Group-Lasso, one is to obtain sparsity on the level of groups in ""standard"" prediction problems, the second one is multi-task learning where the aim is to solve many learning problems in parallel which are coupled via the Group-Lasso constraint. We show that both version perform quite similar in ""standard"" applications. However, a very clear distinction between the variants occurs in multi-task settings where the l1,2 version consistently outperforms the l1,âˆž counterpart in terms of prediction accuracy.",2010,

Heterogeneous Endogenous Effects in Networks,"This paper proposes a new method to identify leaders and followers in a network. Prior works use spatial autoregression models (SARs) which implicitly assume that each individual in the network has the same peer effects on others. Mechanically, they conclude the key player in the network to be the one with the highest centrality. However, when some individuals are more influential than others, centrality may fail to be a good measure. I develop a model that allows for individual-specific endogenous effects and propose a two-stage LASSO procedure to identify influential individuals in a network. Under an assumption of sparsity: only a subset of individuals (which can increase with sample size n) is influential, I show that my 2SLSS estimator for individual-specific endogenous effects is consistent and achieves asymptotic normality. I also develop robust inference including uniformly valid confidence intervals. These results also carry through to scenarios where the influential individuals are not sparse. I extend the analysis to allow for multiple types of connections (multiple networks), and I show how to use the sparse group LASSO to detect which of the multiple connection types is more influential. Simulation evidence shows that my estimator has good finite sample performance. I further apply my method to the data in Banerjee et al. (2013) and my proposed procedure is able to identify leaders and effective networks.",2019,arXiv: Econometrics
Floral and seedling morphology and anatomy of Thalassodendron pachyrhizum den Hartog (cymodoceaceae),"Abstract Thalassodendron pachyrhizum den Hartog is dioecious with inflorescences on short laterals from upright stems. The male inflorescence consists of two flowers which are morphologically identical but developmentally different. Each male flower has two laterally fused anthers, each of which contains four loculi surrounding a vascular bundle. Filiform pollen grains are arranged in coils. The walls of pollen grains contain cellulosic microfibrils embedded in a protein and carbohydrate matrix, and lack an exine layer. The female inflorescence produces two morphologically and developmentally identical flowers, each having an ovary with a short style containing two vascular bundles and leading to two long, slender stigmas. Both male and female inflorescences are enclosed in several alternating bracts. The innermost bract differs from the others by lacking a ligule. Squamulae intravaginales are present in all inflorescences. In each inflorescence, only one ovary develops into the seed which germinates on the parent plant. Young seedlings have an aril-like structure which disappears at a later stage of seedling development. The seedling produces, firstly, an aberrant seedling leaf and a scarious seedling sheath, then several true foliage leaves and finally several root primordia. The mature seedling separates from its protecting bract and detaches from the parent plant.

"On the Subsurface Evolution of Batch Lavas at Stony Bay, Banks Peninsula, New","6 No method exists yet to directly observe the evolution of magma before it reaches the 7 surface. The characteristics of cooled igneous deposits remain the most accessible proxy for 8 inferring subsurface and hot lava processes, and have been used to understand the subtleties of 9 volcanic systems around the world (Aldanmaz, 2005; Kuritani, 1999; Umino & Horio, 1998). 10 Plagioclase phenocrysts, which are very sensitive to changes in pressure, temperature, and 11 dissolved volatile content in a magmatic system, can preserve high resolution records of 12 conditions affecting melts prior to eruption in their chemistry and textures (Singer et al., 1995). 13 For the Miocene volcanics of Banks Peninsula, a poorly understood example of non-plume 14 intraplate volcanism, understanding magmatic processes can be particularly puzzling. Through 15 the observation of the texture, structure, geochemistry, and crystal content of a succession of lava 16 flows on the northeastern flank of the Akaroa Volcanic Complex at Banks Peninsula (Figure 1), 17 this study confirms an existing model of multiple shallow chambers experiencing cycles of 18 fractional crystallization, magma recharge, and evacuation (Johnson et al., in prep). Phenocryst 19 characteristics, especially textures, whole-rock geochemical context, and variations thereof 20 within two identified â€œbatchesâ€ of lavas are of especial focus. From this, a comprehensive 21 magmatic history of these two batches is constructed, including multiple influxes of new melt to 22 magma experiencing both slow and rapid ascent rates and containing varying amounts of 23 dissolved H2O. The role of H2O is postulated as a major control on phenocryst development, 24 overriding the expected mineralogic patterns one would expect based solely on whole rock 25 chemistry. Theories presented in this paper could be further evaluated with the obtaining of 26 phenocryst specific chemical data. 27 INTRODUCTION 28 Interpreting subsurface magmatic processes requires a forensics-like line of inquiry. The 29 evolution of magma is driven by the effects of temperature, pressure, and hydration conditions 30 on a molten material of a given composition (Singer, Dungan, & Layne, 1995). Different 31 characteristics of igneous rocks, the cooled product of magma, such as texture, crystal 32 assemblage, and chemistry, are generated by specific intersections of these conditions and can 33 therefore be used as markers for processes which occurred while the rock was still molten 34 (Singer et al., 1995; Nelson & Montana, 1992; Winter, 2010). Minerals such as plagioclase in 35 mafic rocks can be very sensitive and responsive to changes in a volcanic system, and frequently 36 alter in known, specific ways in their attempt to re-equilibrate with their surroundings (Viccarro, 37 Giacomoni, Ferlito, & Cristofolini, 2010). Looking at plagioclase crysts in individual flows or 38 flow batches within a single stratigraphy found at Stony Bay, therefore, offers insight to the 39 evolution of the local magmatic system at Banks Peninsula over time, including points of 40 recharge, magma mixing, decompression crystallization, etc. 41 GEOLOGIC SETTING 42 Banks Peninsula is a Miocene-Pliocene aged suite of volcanics produced in a period 1243 5.8 ma of intra-plate volcanism in the Zealandia tectonic plate, adjacent to what is now the 44 eastern coast of New Zealandâ€™s south island (Stipp & McDougall, 1968; Hampton, 2010) (Figure 45 1). Unusually, this intra-plate volcanism was driven neither by a mantle plume hotspot like 46 Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain and the Yellowstone hotspot track nor an extensional regime 47 such as produced the East African Rift and ocean spreading centers (Hampton, 2010; Winter 48 2010). Theories regarding the origins of volcanism exist, including a Taylor-Raleigh instability 49 at the base of the lithosphere resulting in two lithosphere detachment events and subsequent 50 upwelling of the asthenosphere, producing the Lyttelton and Akaroa complexes (Timm et al., 51 2009). Other theories link volcanism at Banks Peninsula to a change in tectonic regime in which 52 rotating compression forced oblique-to-normal faulting to compensate for the stress, which 53 opened pathways for hot molten material to rise to the surface (Adams, 1981; Hampton, 2010). 54 Volcanism ceased when the point of pure compression migrated enough to close the conduits 55 (Hampton, 2010). 56 Each explanation has been based on data broadly spanning the peninsula, but with limited 57 focus on individual sections and the evolution of volcanic products over short timescales. 58 Hampton (2010) notes cyclic variations in eruption phases in Lyttelton lavas, linked to cycling 59 batches of material erupting from shallow, periodically recharging chambers. In general, 60 sequences begin with aphyric lava and progresses in a series of layers to highly phenocrystic, 61 blocky flows (Hampton, 2010). Sequences are often topped by pyroclastic flow horizons and the 62 pattern begins again (Hampton 2010 and references therein). Evidence of cycling batches of 63 magma have been observed in multiple locations on Lyttelton Volcano and in Okains Bay on 64 Akaroa Volcano (Hampton, 2010; Johnson et al., in prep). Previous research on Akaroa Volcano 65 has indicated a subsurface network of small chambers at varying depths fed from a main 66 reservoir at depth (Johnson et al., in prep). Eruptions from these stocks are thought to have been 67 initiated by heat influx of new material rising to the shallowest chambers (Stamatelopoulou68 Seymour, Vlassopoulos, Pearce, & Rice, 1990). 69 METHODOLOGY 70 Research was concentrated in a field area encompassing Stony Bay and a series of road 71 cuts along the access road from the adjacent Okains Bay (Figure 2). Four days of fieldwork were 72 conducted, working up the exposed, accessible stratigraphy on the west and east sides of the bay 73 and along the access road. Observations of structures, including flow thickness, dipping 74 direction, and ramping, were recorded, along with categorizations of textures and composition, 75 such as phenocryst content, autobrecciation, degree of weathering, and vesicle distribution. 76 Samples were taken systematically from each lava flow, totaling about fifty samples, and the 77 contacts between flows were mapped (Figure 3). Twenty samples, listed in Table 1, were 78 selected for whole-rock geochemical analysis of major oxides and some trace elements using 79 XRF at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. Eighteen samples, also 80 listed in Table 1, were cut and polished as thin sections for petrographic microscopy. Samples 81 were sorted by level of post-emplacement alteration and the least altered were favored for 82 analysis in order to minimize the variation in chemical data by elements not originally present in 83 the volcanics when they were emplaced. 84 Resulting chemical data was used to categorize flows by type (Table 2 & 3; Figure 4). 85 Chemistry in combination with mineralogy and stratigraphic relationships were used to group 86 flows into possible batches from the same shallow chamber, described in greater detail below. 87 Samples from these batches were then analyzed in greater depth to construct the petrologic story 88 of their evolution within the shallow crust and their emplacement. Plagioclase crysts in particular 89 were observed in thin section for textural petrogenesis markers, including zoning, sieving, and 90 resorbed cores, similar to Vicarro et al. (2010), and categorized in Table 4. 91 DATA 92 The field area, Stony Bay, is a north/northeast-facing cove sheltered on both sides by 93 sheer, exposed rock cliffs. Initially, there were intentions to correlate flow between the two sides, 94 but further field and geochemical analysis revealed very few similarities (Figure 4). The western 95 cliffs are dominated by a foidite flow ~70m thick at its tallest. This flow is anomalously mafic, 96 and does not match the geochemistry of any other deposit in the greater Okains region. Below 97 this flow is a succession of seven smaller units, which include a clastic hawaiite, a picrite basaltic 98 baked ash layer which is significantly more depleted in MgO and alkalis but enriched in 99 Fe2O3(T) and Al2O3 than any other deposit found in the bay, a pepperite, and two extremely 100 weathered units which may have begun as lavas but have since been radically altered by 101 geothermal and weathering processes. Of all the west side deposits, only the oldest, a the clastic 102 hawaiite SB-AJ, bears any resemblance to units (mostly lavas) observed on the east side, as 103 described below. Furthermore, the structure, texture, and chemistry of these deposits varied 104 greatly but displayed no recognizable â€œbatchâ€ patterns and as such are not assessed further in this 105 paper. For more information on the findings on the west side of Stony Bay, see Pincus (2013). 106 The east side of the bay displays significantly less variance â€“ being comprised primarily 107 of picrite basalt, hawaiite, and mugearite lava flows â€“ but more recognizable trends. Flows range 108 typically between 3-10 m in thickness, between aâ€™a and blocky flow types, and contacts between 109 flows are marked by autobreccia. Textures vary between aphanitic, such as in SB-A, â€“D, â€“I, â€“S, 110 and â€“M, and porphyritic with a crystal content as high as ~40% in SB-J and â€“K. All lavas for 111 which thin sections were made show groundmass to be predominantly microcrystalline (as 112 opposed to glassy) and texturally varied between felty and trachytic. Phenocryst and groundmass 113 mineralogy is dominated by plagioclase and also contains pyroxene, olivine which is frequently 114 partially or entirely altered to iddingsite, and small equant opaques. Habits for plagioclase grains 115 vary between subhedral-euhedral equant, rectangular/tabular, or elongated (bladed or lath). 116 Olivine and pyroxene are usually anhed",2013,
The phototoxic effects of herbicides on sugarcane in South Africa.,"Herbicides that are effective in their control of weedsare tested for. possible phytotoxic effects on sugarcane at the South Afncan SugarAssociation Experiment Station. Many resul~s have s~lOwn small effects on cane yield without neeessanly reaching levels of statistical significance in individual expenments. The results of experiments conducted with standard tre.a~ments and other commonly used combinationsofherbicides on varietyNC0376are summarized. Other factors such as the amount of chemical used per hectare and the method.of spraying, and whether it wasa plant or ratoon crop, were investigated at different sites for their effects on th~ developm~nt of the crop and reductions in yield. Relatively small differences wereapparent in the averageeffects of these factors. However, t~e ayerage reduction in yield fro~ all ~ost-e~ergence applications was 3% while no reduct~on. In yield was apparent with pre-emergence applications, ' Introduction Early experiments with sugarcane confirmed the need to control weedsand the efficiency of herbicide treatments for their control (Gosnell'). Some herbicides have little effect on cropgrowthin comparison with the effects ofcompetition from weeds(Gosnelland Thompson'). However, herbicides may cause some damage to sugarcane, so before they are registered the new chemicals are tested on sugarcane by the SASugarAssociationExperiment Station. Plots treated with the chemicalsare compared with untreated control plots that are freeof weedsand plots sprayedwith standard treatments. The results have shown that the effects of standard treatments can vary from one experiment to another. In some trials statisti.cal~y significant differences in cane yield have occurred while In others there may have been no differences (Turner'), Data from a number of trials have been summarized in this paper and the average effects of different treatments determined. Materials and methods , Field trials were conducted using a randomised block design with six replications. Plots consisted of five or six cane rows ea~h 8 m long with 1 m at each end being discarded at the trme of harvest. The two outer rows were also discarded, leavingnet plots of three or four rowseach 6 m long. Experiments were conducted on plant or ratoon cane at Pongola in the northern irrigated areas and at Shakaskraal and Mount Edgecombe on the Natal north coast. A floodjet was used to apply the chemicalsin all the experiments. The output was approximately 300 Q/ha and the pressure was 100 to 200 KPa. Treatments were applied either over the cane row, as directed sprays across the interrow, or over the row before the cane germinated. . NC0376, which has been the variety most widely grown In the South African sugar industry, was used in all the experiments. All unsprayed control plots were kept free from weeds either by hand or by cultivating. All treatments were compared with an unsprayed control and with a standard treatment. The standard treatmentswere diuron + ioxynil + 2,4-D or diuron + 2,4-D + surfactant for the post-emergence experiments and Lasso + atrazine for the pre-emergence experiments. The amounts of herbici?es used were usuallyat the rates intended for registration (single rates) as w~ll as double these rates. Results are given In terms of cane yield as a percentage ofthe yields from the untreated control plots or from the plots sprayed with the standard treatment. Resultsobtained with a selection of herbicide treatments have been assessed. . I?ata obtained when using standard post-emergence herbIcI~es have been.selected to examine the factors that might possibly reduce yields because many results are available. However,no experimentsweredesigned specifically to study these factors. Details of the chemicalsand the rates used in the experiments are given in Appendix I. Results and discussion Standard treatments Diuron + ioxynil + 2,4-D or diuron + 2,4-D + surfactant: An average reduction in yieldof 6%wasobtained froin all applications of this mixture (Table 1). The averageeffects of th~ rates of app!ication, method of spraying, crop stage, and site are given In Table 2. Rates: The average reduction in yield from the use of double rates was 2% more than from the use of single rates. This relatively small increase in damage with a 100% increasein the amount of chemical used confirms previous work done by Richardson"" with 2,4-D. This effect was more pronounced at Shakaskraal than at Pongola, especially in ratoon cane. Spray method: The average increase in yield from directed sprays compared with sprays applied onto the cane row was 3%. This was shown by Richardson"" to be dependent on the growth stage of the cane when 2,4-D was applied. The mean height of the leaf canopy at the time of spraying was 400 mm in the ex~riments ?onducted at the SASA ExperimentStation, and this small difference of 3% supports the previous findings. Richardson' suggested when the leaf canopy is higher th~n ?OO mm, the crop is likely to be more affected by applications over the row than by those directed between the rows. Cane in which the height of the leafcanopy is 500mm or less,is likelyto be more affected by directed sprays.Damage from these treatments therefore appears to be related to the aI?ount of foliar coveragerather than to the method of spraying.",1990,
"Consumers of sea urchins, Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula, in shallow Mediterranean rocky reefs","Underwater observations on fish and asteroid consumers (i.e. predators and scavengers) of sea urchins, Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula, were carried out at several locations in shallow Mediterranean rocky reefs. Observations conducted in the marine reserve of Torre Guaceto (Adriatic Sea) revealed that sparid fishes, Diplodus sargus and D. vulgaris, are the main fish predators of small (<1Â cm in test diameter) and medium (1â€“4Â cm) sea urchins, whereas the labrids Coris julis and Thalassoma pavo preyed only upon small sea urchins. Large D. sargus were able to prey upon small and medium, and occasionally large (>4Â cm) sea urchins, whereas medium and small Diplodus preyed mainly upon small sea urchins. The number of sea urchins preyed upon by fishes was negatively related to sea urchin size for both species. P. lividus appeared to be subject to higher predation levels than A. lixula. The scavenger guild comprised 11 fish species, with D. sargus, D. vulgaris, Coris julis and Chromis chromis accounting for about 80% of scavenger fishes. Observations performed at several locations in the Mediterranean on the predatory asteroid Marthasterias glacialis revealed that only 3% of the detected individuals were preying upon sea urchins. Due to the importance of sea urchins for assemblage structure and functioning of Mediterranean rocky reef ecosystems, these results may have also important implications for management of fishing activities.",2004,Helgoland Marine Research
Predicting individual differences in placebo analgesia: contributions of brain activity during anticipation and pain experience.,"Recent studies have identified brain correlates of placebo analgesia, but none have assessed how accurately patterns of brain activity can predict individual differences in placebo responses. We reanalyzed data from two fMRI studies of placebo analgesia (N = 47), using patterns of fMRI activity during the anticipation and experience of pain to predict new subjects' scores on placebo analgesia and placebo-induced changes in pain processing. We used a cross-validated regression procedure, LASSO-PCR, which provided both unbiased estimates of predictive accuracy and interpretable maps of which regions are most important for prediction. Increased anticipatory activity in a frontoparietal network and decreases in a posterior insular/temporal network predicted placebo analgesia. Patterns of anticipatory activity across the cortex predicted a moderate amount of variance in the placebo response (âˆ¼12% overall, âˆ¼40% for study 2 alone), which is substantial considering the multiple likely contributing factors. The most predictive regions were those associated with emotional appraisal, rather than cognitive control or pain processing. During pain, decreases in limbic and paralimbic regions most strongly predicted placebo analgesia. Responses within canonical pain-processing regions explained significant variance in placebo analgesia, but the pattern of effects was inconsistent with widespread decreases in nociceptive processing. Together, the findings suggest that engagement of emotional appraisal circuits drives individual variation in placebo analgesia, rather than early suppression of nociceptive processing. This approach provides a framework that will allow prediction accuracy to increase as new studies provide more precise information for future predictive models.",2011,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience
Scores for sepsis detection and risk stratification â€“ construction of a novel score using a statistical approach and validation of RETTS,"BACKGROUND
To allow early identification of patients at risk of sepsis in the emergency department (ED), a variety of risk stratification scores and/or triage systems are used. The first aim of this study was to develop a risk stratification score for sepsis based upon vital signs and biomarkers using a statistical approach. Second, we aimed to validate the Rapid Emergency Triage and Treatment System (RETTS) for sepsis. RETTS combines vital signs with symptoms for risk stratification.


METHODS
We retrospectively analysed data from two prospective, observational, multicentre cohorts of patients from studies of biomarkers in ED. A candidate risk stratification score called Sepsis Heparin-binding protein-based Early Warning Score (SHEWS) was constructed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operator (LASSO) method. SHEWS and RETTS were compared to National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) for infection-related organ dysfunction, intensive care or death within the first 72h after admission (i.e. sepsis).


RESULTS
506 patients with a diagnosed infection constituted cohort A, in which SHEWS was derived and RETTS was validated. 435 patients constituted cohort B of whom 184 had a diagnosed infection where both scores were validated. In both cohorts (A and B), AUC for infection-related organ dysfunction, intensive care or death was higher for NEWS2, 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.84) and 0.69 (95% CI 0.63-0.74), than RETTS, 0.74 (95% CI 0.70-0.79) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.49-0.60), p = 0.05 and p <0.01, respectively. SHEWS had the highest AUC, 0.73 (95% CI 0.68-0.79) p = 0.32 in cohort B.


CONCLUSIONS
Even with a statistical approach, we could not construct better risk stratification scores for sepsis than NEWS2. RETTS was inferior to NEWS2 for screening for sepsis.",2020,PLoS ONE
Development of a radiomics nomogram based on the 2D and 3D CT features to predict the survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients,"ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to develop a radiomics nomogram by combining the optimized radiomics signatures extracted from 2D and/or 3D CT images and clinical predictors to assess the overall survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsOne training cohort of 239 and two validation datasets of 80 and 52 NSCLC patients were enrolled in this study. Nine hundred seventy-five radiomics features were extracted from each patientâ€™s 2D and 3D CT images. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to select features and generate a radiomics signature. Cox hazard survival analysis and Kaplan-Meier were performed in both cohorts. The radiomics nomogram was developed by integrating the optimized radiomics signature and clinical predictors, its calibration and discrimination were evaluated.ResultsThe radiomics signatures were significantly associated with NSCLC patientsâ€™ survival time. The signature derived from the combined 2D and 3D features showed a better prognostic performance than those from 2D or 3D alone. Our radiomics nomogram integrated the optimal radiomics signature with clinical predictors showed a significant improvement in the prediction of patientsâ€™ survival compared with clinical predictors alone in the validation cohort. The calibration curve showed predicted survival time was very close to the actual one.ConclusionsThe radiomics signature from the combined 2D and 3D features further improved the predicted accuracy of survival prognosis for the patients with NSCLC. Combination of the optimal radiomics signature and clinical predictors performed better for individualied survival prognosis estimation in patients with NSCLC. These findings might affect trearment strategies and enable a step forward for precise medicine.Key Pointsâ€¢ We found both 2D and 3D radiomics signature have favorable prognosis, but 3D signature had a better performance.â€¢ The radiomics signature generated from the combined 2D and 3D features had a better predictive performance than those from 2D or 3D features.â€¢ Integrating the optimal radiomics signature with clinical predictors significantly improved the predictive power in patientsâ€™ survival compared with clinical TNM staging alone.",2018,European Radiology

"MÃºsica, Muerte, y Jaripeo: Sound, Gender, and Violence in Diasporic Mexican Rodeo Videos","Considering its title, it is a bit odd that the film 33 Muertes del Jaripeo (2003) does not start with a death. Instead the opening shot is merely a bull ride gone horribly wrong. A rider finds himself trapped on a bull draped in ineffectual lassos. The hapless rider is whipped around in what is obvious pain, but he survives. The first death on the back of a bull comes in the second clip, filmed in grainy video dated 1996 in the corner of the frame. The viewer is given a close-up on the dead man's face. More deaths and horrifying accidents follow rapidly, interspersed with scenes of generalized violence and chaos in the jaripeo (rodeo) ring. The deadly rides are marked on the screen with a flaming yellow skull superimposed in the corner of the frame. This skull appears at the beginning of each fatal clip, signaling that greater attention may be demanded from the viewer interested in death. Some of the most gruesome clips are slowed down or repeated to allow a viewer to linger over the deaths (Figure 1).Throughout all of this carnage, banda and narcocorrido superstar Chalino Sanchez sings corridos (Mexican ballads), starting with an old Mexican Revolutionary one titled ""Donde Lloro El General."" This pattern of violence and death accompanied by Sanchez's corridos follows for the rest of the video. Surprisingly, none of the twenty-seven songs in this video are about jaripeos, bulls, or bullriders. They are not even mostly about death. Instead the songs present a mixture of topics about dead bandits, narcotraficantes (""Silvestre Murillo""), and especially corridos of classic Mexican themes. A fifth of the songs are about Pancho Villa, such as ""La Tumba de Villa,"" ""Corrido Villista,"" ""Caballos de Pancho Villa,"" and ""80 Cargas Suicidas."" The music continues along at Sanchez's signature midtempo pace, his raw and raspy singing framing the action and the thirty-three deaths. The music provides no sense of danger and no relief from the brutal images, which continue one after another without relent. Each song is introduced on screen but no attempt is made to sync the music with the action. The video rolls on as the songs continue. At times it is almost as if the viewer is listening to a recording while watching the riders die in a kind of silence.Chalino Sanchez is credited with igniting the popularity of banda music in the fluid transnational musical borderlands of the United States and Mexico, so the use of his music in this death video has clear commercial underpinnings. Sanchez popularized the heavily masculine style of Sinaloan rural and narco culture in the migrant communities in the United States. His imprint on Mexican regional music, masculinized migrant style, and the enduring popularity of narcocorridos cannot be overstated, as Sam Quinones and loan Grillo have explored. The association of Sanchez with drug traffickers, his possibility murderous background, and his own mysterious murder at the height of his fame makes him a logical choice for a video of rodeo mishaps and deaths, even if he did not sing specifically about it. The film 33 Muertes del Jaripeo is one of many products which grafts Mexican regional music styles with torrents of rodeo death images.This article examines a wide of variety of these videos out of a sampling of sixty films to argue that jaripeo music and death videos form a specific genre in Mexican musical life and cultural expression in the United States in the early twentiethfirst century. Jaripeos are traditional rodeos centered on bull riding and a staple of the rural Mexican countryside brought north to the United States. Jaripeos connect bands, bulls, riders, and individuals in the US diaspora with regional Mexican musical and rodeo cultures in a dynamic transnational flow of culture, commerce, and sound. The ubiquity of the brass band style of music called banda as well as accordion driven norteno music (and sometimes other styles) at jaripeos, and in the numerous jaripeo music videos for sale at flea markets and other places Mexican and migrant music is sold, makes jaripeos a significant window into the sonic experience of Mexican migrant life in the United States. â€¦",2015,The Journal of American Culture
"Understanding the British Empire: Introduction: perspectives, policies, and people","At the beginning of the fifth century, St Augustine, bishop of Hippo, contemplated from his North African home the still-vast domains of the Roman empire. He debated the question of whether it was fitting for good men to rejoice at the expansion of empires over less civilised peoples. He concluded that extending rulership over subjugated nations might seem to bad men felicity, but good men could accept it as a necessity. Many generations since have asked the same question as Augustine, when they encountered empires of all kinds, from theocracies to thalassocracies. Some have been called beneficent, designated with the honorific â€˜Paxâ€™. Some have been called evil. All of them have excited controversy and continue to do so. The British empire is no exception. None, however, rivalled it for complexity and geographical spread. Those who ran it firmly believed in its fundamental Augustinian necessity. Their sense of duty perhaps blinded them to an inherent infelicity. To understand this complicated and ambivalent British enterprise is a challenge, but a rewarding one. Writing about British overseas experience has been opened up fruitfully in several directions in the past fifty years. Fresh perspectives have come from the concept of â€˜informal empireâ€™, and from different disciplines, such as global and comparative history, from anthropology and â€˜history-from-belowâ€™, and from various manifestations of cultural history, such as sport, masculinity, and women's history.",2010,
Model-based clustering for high-dimension data. Application to functional data.,"Finite mixture regression models are useful for modeling the relationship between response and predictors, arising from different subpopulations. In this article, we study high-dimensional predic- tors and high-dimensional response, and propose two procedures to deal with this issue. We propose to use the Lasso estimator to take into account the sparsity, and a penalty on the rank, to take into account the matrix structure. Then, we extend these procedures to the functional case, where predictors and responses are functions. For this purpose, we use a wavelet-based approach. Finally, for each situation, we provide algorithms, and apply and evaluate our methods both on simulations and real datasets.",2014,
"Characterization of Indoor Air Bacterial Isolates from Rafidia Hospital, Nablus-Palestine","Air can play a vital role as a reservoir for both pathogenic and non pathogenic living microorganisms. Microbial contamination of air hospitals is considered as a source of hospitalassociated infections. This study aimed to assess microbial profile of air contamination in different wards of Rafidia Hospital, City of Nablus-Palestine, during the period September and October 2014, using both an active and a passive sampling methods. Results of this research showed that total viable count of Gram positive bacteria; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Micrococcus spp. were the most predominant among isolated bacteria from air samples in all surgical operation rooms (SOR), intensive care unit (ICU) and neonatal room (NR) by passive air sampling method. The percentage of CoNS and Micrococcus spp. in air of SORs, ICU and NR by passive air sampling has ranged from 61.8%-100% and the average was 5158 CFU/m/h to 17753 Original Research Article Adwan et al.; ACRI, 5(3): 1-11, 2016; Article no.ACRI.29066 2 CFU/m/h. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common microorganisms isolated from the neonatal room by active air sampling method, the percentage was 100% and the average was 100 CFU/m. Total bacterial level in these rooms had a range 116 CFU/m to 1085 CFU/m. The percentage of CoNS and Micrococcus spp. in air from SORs and ICU by active air sampling was 58.8%-100% and the average was 100-1080 CFU/m. The finding of this research showed that most frequent CFUs were obtained from Blood agar with a range 4085 CFU/m/h to 8721 CFU/m/h and Tryptic Soy Agar with a range 2043 CFU/ m/h to 7935 CFU/ m/h by passive air sampling method. In this study, ERIC PCR profile (number and size of bands) revealed that clinical bacterial strains S. aureus, E. coli and Klebsiella spp. and those isolated from air samples collected at the same time were not clonally related. This study is considered the first one to be conducted in Palestine in order to determine air bacterial isolates in SORs, ICU and NR. More studies are warranted on quality of air in these rooms. These data may be valuable to develop interventions to improve the microbial indoor air quality among hospital SORs, ICU and NR and also for preventing or decreasing the occurrence of the nosocomial infections.",2015,
[Bilio-intestinal bypass in the treatment of metabolic syndrome in obese patient].,"INTRODUCTION
obesity (O) is a chronic patologic condition, evolutive and relapsing, with multifactorial etiopathogenesis, consisting in an alteration of the body's composition characterized by a relative and absolute excess of fat, that gets worse the life quality and causes complications that can lead to death.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
experience concerns twenty-five diabetic obese patients underwent bilio-intestinal by-pass between January 2006-December 2007. All these patients, before the surgical operation, underwent a rigorous clinical and laboratory examination. Besides, a precise rate control of laboratory, overlap with those performed in the pre-operative period of operation, was required for each patient: the first after one month, the second after six months and the third after twelve months.


RESULTS
the average weight loss was about 40 kg and, more important, these data show that the BMI is reduced, until to become stable, after 12 months from surgical operation, about values 34-31 Kg/mÂ², obtaining, in this way, an improvement of values in the development metabolic syndrome and, above all, heart rate and ventricular repolarization.


CONCLUSIONS
the data obtained by our study support the hypothesis to suggest the operations of bariatric malassorbing surgery, in particular bilio-intestinal by-pass, as prophylactic methods for dismetabolics diseases, with reduction of cardiovascular risk in obese patient.",2010,Il Giornale di chirurgia
Autologous Fat Grafting's Effect on Edema and Ecchymoses in Primary Open Rhinoplasty.,"BACKGROUND
Autologous fat is a safe and effective soft tissue filler. Recent evidence also suggests improved wound healing and immune modulation with fat grafting.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study is to describe a novel technique, using fat grafting during primary open rhinoplasty. We hypothesize a more rapid resolution of bruising and edema.


METHODS
Patients undergoing rhinoplasty were reviewed, and compared by presence or absence of concurrent fat grafting. 3D images were analyzed using Mirror (Vectra, Canfield Scientific, NJ). Ecchymoses were outlined utilizing a magnetic lasso followed by an area measurement. Volumetric edema measurements were also taken and assessed. Edema and ecchymosis were measured at two weeks postoperatively and six weeks postoperatively. Significance was defined as p=0.05.


RESULTS
Sixty-two patients were included. Thirty-three patients (53.2%) received autologous fat grafting and 29 (46.8%) did not. Age, gender, surgical approach, and osteotomy distribution was similar between the groups. The fat grafted group showed 7.29 cm2 fewer ecchymoses (p<0.001) and 0.73cc less edema, (p=0.68) in the early postoperative interval. Six weeks postoperatively, the fat grafted group showed 1cc lower amount of edema (p=0.36) with negligible differences in bruising.


CONCLUSIONS
Autologous fat grafting is a useful adjunct to rhinoplasty and is associated with a significantly lower amount of ecchymoses in the acute postoperative period.",2019,Aesthetic surgery journal
Aplastic Anemia: Which Treatment?,"The word aplastic means unformed; it is derived from the Greek negative prefix a and plasso, to form. In aplastic anemia, blood does not form, leading to deficiencies of granulocytes, platelets, and erythrocytes and to severe clinical consequences, of which infection and bleeding are the most important. In 1935, the course of this disease was considered progressively, inexorably, and more or less rapidly, fatal (1). In the past 30 years, morbidity and mortality from aplastic anemia have dramatically decreased because of two effective interventions: allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and immunosuppression with antithymocyte globulin (or antilymphocyte globulin) and cyclosporine. Five-year survival rates are now 70% to 90%. However, clinicians face increasingly complex decisions in selecting the optimal strategy for an individual patient because short-term toxicity, the rapidity and completeness of hematologic recovery, and late complications must be considered. In this issue, Brodsky and colleagues (2) report a third option for initial treatment of aplastic anemia. They treated 19 patients with high-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg of body weight for 4 days), which is routinely used as a preparative regimen before transplantation, but did not provide allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. Survival at 2 years was 84%. Although the study was small and uncontrolled, the data are provocative. In aplastic anemia, reticulocytes are decreased or absent, and hematopoietic cells generally account for less than 10% to 15% of the cellularity of marrow biopsy specimens. The low frequency of CD34-positive cells in the bone marrow and of progenitor cells (erythroid burst-forming units, granulocytemacrophage colony-forming units, and long-term culture-initiating cells) suggest that hematopoietic stem cells are depleted or that their ability to differentiate is impaired. The injury to the marrow is often immunologically mediated and may involve excessive production of interferon- and tumor necrosis factor by activated Th1 lymphocytes (3). These chemokines can trigger Fas-receptor expression on CD34-positive cells to facilitate programmed cell death (3). The intent of therapy is to replace hematopoietic stem cells or suppress the immune attack, allowing residual and probably damaged hematopoietic stem cells to recover. For marrow transplantation, cells are obtained from a sibling matched for HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR. Alternatively (and more commonly), donors are given granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells from marrow into the peripheral blood; cells are then collected by pheresis. This approach is better for the donor (it avoids the risks of anesthesia) and for the recipient (it produces more rapid engraftment). Before transplantation, patients receive immunosuppression to eliminate autoimmune contributors to aplasia and to prevent rejection of the graft. The fact that cyclophosphamide depletes myeloid progenitor cells in addition to decreasing the number and function of T and B lymphocytes is inconsequential, since the patients' hematopoietic stem cells will be replaced. Hematopoietic recovery after transplantation is rapid, complete, and stable. Five-year survival rates are 70% to 80% in registry data (4, 5) and up to 90% in single-institution studies (6). However, survival was age dependent (75% for patients younger than 20 years of age, 68% for patients 20 to 40 years of age, and 35% for patients older than 40 years of age) in the analysis of 1699 patients in the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry who had transplantation between 1991 and 1997 (4), largely because the incidence of graft-versus-host disease increases with age. Late complications of transplantation also occur, including restrictive or obstructive lung disease (in 24% of patients surviving 2 years), osteoporosis (in 18%), and solid tumor (in 12%) (7). All complications are more common in persons with graft-versus-host disease. As important, only 30% of patients have an HLA-matched sibling (a 25% chance per sibling), and graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease are more problematic (and outcomes are less favorable) when alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells, including mismatched sibling cells, HLA-matched unrelated cells, or cord blood cells, are used (8). A second established therapy for aplastic anemia is immunosuppression, typically with horse antithymocyte globulin, 40 mg/kg daily for 4 days (or horse or rabbit antilymphocyte globulin), and cyclosporine, given to maintain a serum level of 200 to 300 ng/mL for 6 months or longer (9). Steroids are given for 2 weeks to prevent serum sickness from the foreign protein (antithymocyte globulin or antilymphocyte globulin), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may be given if the patient has significant granulocytopenia or infection. Overall 5-year survival rates are equivalent to those of transplantation, despite the older median age of patients in many studies (5, 10, 11). Hematologic responses, however, are often incomplete, and success is measured as a granulocyte count greater than 0.5 109 cells/L and independence from transfusion rather than normalization of the complete blood count. Immunosuppression produces some adverse effects, including cyclosporine-induced renal failure and hypertension and ongoing risk for opportunistic infection, since most patients (62% [11]) require long-term cyclosporine therapy to maintain safe blood counts. Emergence of a clonal hematologic disorder is also a major concern. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, detected by the absence of glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins on blood cells on flow cytometry, is common both at the time of presentation of aplastic anemia and after immunosuppressive therapies (12, 13). It is thought that damaged hematopoietic stem cells are genetically unstable and acquire the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria defect through somatic mutation. Resulting clones may be relatively resistant to the immune surveillance or to Fas-mediated damage and may preferentially expand (13). The myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelogenous leukemia occurs in approximately 10% to 20% of patients after immunosuppressive therapies (13) and may have a similar pathogenesis. In a pilot study (14), Brodsky and colleagues treated 10 patients with high-dose cyclophosphamide, of whom 7 had complete and durable responses. In this issue (2), the authors report on 19 additional patients ( 40 years of age or <40 years of age but without an HLA-matched donor) who were treated at initial presentation. As expected, cytopenia worsened in all patients, but surprisingly, few early deaths occurred and the probability of survival was 84% at 2 and 4 years. The likelihood of normal blood cell counts was 65% at 50 months. The kinetics of response, however, were very slow; a complete response was seen in fewer than 10% of patients at 1 year and in 25% at 2 years. This, plus the long time to a granulocyte count greater than 0.5 109 cells/L (median, 7 weeks) and independence from platelet transfusion (defined as platelet count > 10 109 cells/L; median, 18 weeks), implies that many patients were critically cytopenic for long periods. Whether equivalent success will be seen in larger groups of patients is uncertain; a related study at the National Institutes of Health that used the same dosage of cyclophosphamide (plus cyclosporine) was terminated prematurely because of unexpected early deaths (15). In addition, administration of high-dose cyclophosphamide could be especially dangerous at treatment sites with less sophisticated supportive care. Of note, Brodsky and colleagues found no evidence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelodysplasia, or acute myelogenous leukemia in the 16 responding patients in their current study (median follow-up, 34 months) (2) and in the 6 long-term survivors from their pilot study (median follow-up, 14 years) (2, 14). Could paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clones be specifically sensitive to cyclophosphamide, or does cyclophosphamide suppress immunologic activity in such a way that a paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clone no longer has a selective advantage? Why were myelodysplasia and acute myelogenous leukemia not seen? Because patients who receive cyclophosphamide for lymphoma or ovarian cancer have an increased risk for hematologic cancer (16), larger samples and longer follow-up are needed before conclusions can be drawn. How should a clinician respond to the current data? I generally choose marrow transplantation as the first therapy for patients younger than 50 years of age (and for selected patients 50 to 55 years of age) who have HLA-matched sibling donors. The use of leukocyte-depleted blood products, advances in antibiotic therapy, and improved methods to prevent and treat graft-versus-host disease made transplantation safer in the 1990s than the 1980s (5, 17, 18), and this treatment is probably even safer now than it was 5 years ago. All other patients should receive antithymocyte globulin or antilymphocyte globulin with cyclosporine or should be enrolled in clinical trials of novel therapies. Cyclophosphamide, other immunologic therapies (such as mycophenolate mofetil or rapamycin) and transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from sources other than HLA-matched siblings should be considered experimental approaches for the initial management of aplastic anemia until larger groups of patients are studied or groups of patients are identified for whom these treatments offer a unique benefit.",2001,Annals of Internal Medicine
Log-Contrast Regression with Functional Compositional Predictors: Linking Preterm Infant's Gut Microbiome Trajectories in Early Postnatal Period to Neurobehavioral Outcome,"When compositional data serve as predictors in regression, the log-contrast model is commonly applied. A prominent feature of the model is that it complies with the simplex geometry and enables the regression analysis to have various desirable invariance properties. Motivated by the needs in understanding how the trajectories of gut microbiome compositions during early postnatal stage impact later neurobehavioral outcomes among preterm infants, we develop a sparse log-contrast regression with functional compositional predictors. The functional simplex structure is preserved by a set of zero-sum constraints on the parameters, and the compositional predictors are allowed to have sparse, smoothly varying, and accumulating effects on the outcome through time. Through basis expansion, the problem boils down to a linearly constrained group lasso regression, for which we develop an efficient augmented Lagrangian algorithm and obtain theoretical performance guarantees. The proposed approach yields interesting results in the preterm infant study. The identified microbiome markers and the estimated time dynamics of their impact on the neurobehavioral outcome shed lights on the functional linkage between stress accumulation in early postnatal stage and neurodevelpomental process of infants.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Automatic node selection for Deep Neural Networks using Group Lasso regularization,"We examine the effect of the Group Lasso (gLasso) regularizer in selecting the salient nodes of Deep Neural Network (DNN) hidden layers by applying a DNN-HMM hybrid speech recognizer to TED Talks speech data.

Furthermore, we compare gLasso and L2 regularizers. Our experiment results demonstrate that our DNN training, in which the gLasso regularizer was embedded, successfully selected the hidden layer nodes that are necessary and sufficient for achieving high classification power.",2017,"2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
A new forecasting framework for volatile behavior in net electricity consumption: A case study in Turkey,"Electricity is a significant form of energy that cannot be stored physically and is usually generated as needed. In most research studies, the main aim is to ensure that sufficient electricity is generated to meet future needs. In order to avoid waste or shortage, a good system needs to be designed to constantly maintain the level of electricity needed. It is necessary to estimate independent factors because future electricity volume is based not only on current net consumption but also on independent factors. In this paper, a new framework is proposed to first estimate future independent factors using SARIMA (seasonal auto-regressive iterative moving average) method and NARANN (nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural network) method, both of which are called a â€forecasted scenario approachâ€. Subsequently, based on these scenarios, a LADES (LASSO-based adaptive evolutionary simulated annealing) model and a RADES (ridge-based adaptive evolutionary simulated annealing) model are applied to forecast the future NEC (net electricity consumption). The proposed approaches are then validated with a case study in Turkey. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms others when compared to previous approaches. Finally, the results show that the NEC can be modeled, and it can be used to predict the future NEC.",2015,Energy
Joint Estimation of Multiple Conditional Gaussian Graphical Models,"In this paper, we propose a joint conditional graphical Lasso to learn multiple conditional Gaussian graphical models, also known as Gaussian conditional random fields, with some similar structures. Our model builds on the maximum likelihood method with the convex sparse group Lasso penalty. Moreover, our model is able to model multiple multivariate linear regressions with unknown noise covariances via a convex formulation. In addition, we develop an efficient approximated Newtonâ€™s method for optimizing our model. Theoretically, we establish the asymptotic properties of our model on consistency and sparsistency under the high-dimensional settings. Finally, extensive numerical results on simulations and real data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms the compared methods on structure recovery and structured output prediction. To the best of our knowledge, the joint learning of multiple multivariate regressions with unknown covariance is first studied.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems
Optimal-Tuned Weighted LASSO for Massive MIMO Channel Estimation with Limited RF Chains,"Channel estimation (CE) in massive MIMO system with limited RF chains is known to be a challenging problem. In many cases, base station (BS) can obtain certain channel support side information (CSSI), which can be exploited to enhance the CE performance and reduce the pilot overhead. Due to imperfectness of prior information, it's very important to utilize the CSSI in an optimal way to improve the CE performance. We propose an optimal-tuned weighted LASSO algorithm which can fully exploit the imperfect CSSI to optimize the CE performance in massive MIMO system with limited RF chains. In the proposed algorithm, the weighted l_{1} norm is used as the regularization function and the weights on the known support part (as indicated by the CSSI) and the rest are different. Based on the accuracy of CSSI, we obtain closed-form solution for the optimal LASSO weights which minimize the asymptotic normalized squared error (aNSE). Moreover, we derive closed-form expression of the minimum aNSE and characterize the minimum number of required pilots to achieve stable channel recovery. The theoretical analysis and simulation both show the performance advantages of our proposed solution over various baselines.",2017,GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference
N ov 2 01 5 Consistent Parameter Estimation for LASSO and Approximate Message Passing,"We consider the problem of recovering a vector Î²o âˆˆ R from n random and noisy linear observations y = XÎ²o +w, where X is the measurement matrix and w is noise. The LASSO estimate is given by the solution to the optimization problem Î²Ì‚Î» = argminÎ² 1 2 â€–y âˆ’ XÎ²â€–2 + Î»â€–Î²â€–1. Among the iterative algorithms that have been proposed for solving this optimization problem, approximate message passing (AMP) has attracted attention for its fast convergence. The iterations of AMP are given by Î² = Î·(Î² +Xz; Ï„ ), z = y âˆ’XÎ² + |I| n z, where Î², z, and I denote estimates of Î²o, yâˆ’XÎ²o, and the active set of Î²o at iteration t respectively. Î·(xi; Ï„) = (|xi| âˆ’ Ï„)+sign(xi) denotes the soft thresholding function with threshold parameter Ï„ . Despite significant progress in the theoretical analysis of the estimates of LASSO and AMP, little is known about their behavior as a function of the regularization parameter Î», or the thereshold parameters Ï„ t. For instance the following basic questions have not yet been studied in the literature: (i) How does the size of the active set â€–Î²Ì‚â€–0/p behave as a function of Î»? (ii) How does the mean square error â€–Î²Ì‚Î»âˆ’Î²oâ€– 2 2/p behave as a function of Î»? (iii) How does â€–Î² âˆ’Î²oâ€–2/p behave as a function of Ï„1, . . . , Ï„ tâˆ’1? Answering these questions will help in addressing practical challenges regarding the optimal tuning of Î» or Ï„1, Ï„2, . . .. This paper answers these questions in the asymptotic setting (i.e., where p â†’ âˆž, n â†’ âˆž while the ratio n/p converges to a fixed number in (0, 1)) and shows how these results can be employed in deriving simple and theoretically optimal approaches for tuning the parameters Ï„1, . . . , Ï„ t for AMP or Î» for LASSO. It also explores the connection between the optimal tuning of the parameters of AMP and the optimal tuning of LASSO. MSC 2010 subject classifications: 62G05, 62J05.",2017,
Adaptive posterior mode estimation of a sparse sequence for model selection,"For the problem of estimating a sparse sequence of coefficients of a parametric or non-parametric generalized linear model, posterior mode estimation with a Subbotin(""Î»"",""Î½"") prior achieves thresholding and therefore model selection when ""Î½"" is an element of [0,1] for a class of likelihood functions. The proposed estimator also offers a continuum between the (forward/backward) best subset estimator (""Î½"" e 0 ), its approximate convexification called lasso (""Î½"" e 1 ) and ridge regression (""Î½"" e 2 ). Rather than fixing ""Î½"", selecting the two hyperparameters ""Î»"" and ""Î½"" adds flexibility for a better fit, provided both are well selected from the data. Considering first the canonical Gaussian model, we generalize the Stein unbiased risk estimate, SURE(""Î»"",""Î½""), to the situation where the thresholding function is not almost differentiable (i.e. ""Î½"" l 1 ). We then propose a more general selection of ""Î»"" and ""Î½"" by deriving an information criterion that can be employed for instance for the lasso or wavelet smoothing. We investigate some asymptotic properties in parametric and non-parametric settings. Simulations and applications to real data show excellent performance.

Prognostic Value of Right Ventricular Dysfunction in Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction: Superiority of Longitudinal Strain Over Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion,"Backgroundâ€” In heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction, right ventricular (RV) impairment, as defined by reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, is a predictor of poor outcome. However, peak longitudinal strain of RV free wall (RVFWS) has been recently proposed as a more accurate and sensitive tool to evaluate RV function. Accordingly, we investigated whether RVFWS could help refine prognosis of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction in whom tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is still preserved. Methods and Resultsâ€” A total of 200 patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (age, 66Â±11 years; ejection fraction, 30Â±7%) with preserved tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (>16 mm) underwent RV function assessment using speckle-tracking echocardiography to measure peak RVFWS. After a median follow-up period of 28 months, 62 (31%) patients reached the primary composite end point of all-cause death/HF rehospitalization. Median RVFWS was âˆ’19.3% (interquartile range, âˆ’23.3% to âˆ’15.0%). By lasso-penalized Cox-hazard model, RVFWS was an independent predictor of outcome, along with Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure-HF score, Echo-HF score, and severe mitral regurgitation. The best cutoff value of RVFWS for prediction of outcome was âˆ’15.3% (area under the curve, 0.68; P<0.001; sensitivity, 50%; specificity, 80%). In 50 patients (25%), RVFWS was impaired (ie, â‰¥âˆ’15.3%); event rate (per 100 patients per year) was greater in them than in patients with RVFWS <âˆ’15.3% (29.5% [95% confidence interval, 20.4â€“42.7] versus 9.4% [95% confidence interval, 6.7â€“13.1]; P<0.001). RVFWS yielded a significant net reclassification improvement (0.584 at 3 years; P<0.001), with 68% of nonevents correctly reclassified. Conclusionsâ€” In patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction with preserved tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, RV free-wall strain provides incremental prognostic information and improved risk stratification.",2018,Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging
Combining micro-RNA and protein sequencing to detect robust biomarkers for Gravesâ€™ disease and orbitopathy,"Gravesâ€™ Disease (GD) is an autoimmune condition in which thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TRAB) mimic thyroid-stimulating hormone function causing hyperthyroidism. 5% of GD patients develop inflammatory Gravesâ€™ orbitopathy (GO) characterized by proptosis and attendant sight problems. A major challenge is to identify which GD patients are most likely to develop GO and has relied on TRAB measurement. We screened sera/plasma from 14 GD, 19 GO and 13 healthy controls using high-throughput proteomics and miRNA sequencing (Illuminaâ€™s HiSeq2000 and Agilent-6550 Funnel quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry) to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis evaluation. Euclidean distances and differential expression (DE) based on miRNA and protein quantification were analysed by multidimensional scaling (MDS) and multinomial regression respectively. We detected 3025 miRNAs and 1886 proteins and MDS revealed good separation of the 3 groups. Biomarkers were identified by combined DE and Lasso-penalized predictive models; accuracy of predictions was 0.86 (Â±0:18), and 5 miRNA and 20 proteins were found including Zonulin, Alpha-2 macroglobulin, Beta-2 glycoprotein 1 and Fibronectin. Functional analysis identified relevant metabolic pathways, including hippo signaling, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells and mRNA surveillance. Proteomic and miRNA analyses, combined with robust bioinformatics, identified circulating biomarkers applicable to diagnose GD, predict GO disease status and optimize patient management.",2018,Scientific Reports
Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers,"Many problems of recent interest in statistics and machine learning can be posed in the framework of convex optimization. Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of features or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable. In this review, we argue that the alternating direction method of multipliers is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and in particular to large-scale problems arising in statistics, machine learning, and related areas. The method was developed in the 1970s, with roots in the 1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to many other algorithms, such as dual decomposition, the method of multipliers, Douglasâ€“Rachford splitting, Spingarn's method of partial inverses, Dykstra's alternating projections, Bregman iterative algorithms for l1 problems, proximal methods, and others. After briefly surveying the theory and history of the algorithm, we discuss applications to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning problems of recent interest, including the lasso, sparse logistic regression, basis pursuit, covariance selection, support vector machines, and many others. We also discuss general distributed optimization, extensions to the nonconvex setting, and efficient implementation, including some details on distributed MPI and Hadoop MapReduce implementations.",2011,Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning

False Discovery Rate Control with Concave Penalties Using Stability Selection,"False discovery rate (FDR) control is highly desirable in several high-dimensional estimation problems. While solving such problems, it is observed that traditional approaches such as the Lasso select a high number of false positives, which increase with higher noise and correlation levels in the dataset. Stability selection is a procedure which uses randomization with the Lasso to reduce the number of false positives. It is known that concave regularizers such as the minimax concave penalty (MCP) have a higher resistance to false positives than the Lasso in the presence of such noise and correlation. The benefits with respect to false positive control for developing an approach integrating stability selection with concave regularizers has not been studied in the literature so far. This motivates us to develop a novel upper bound on false discovery rate control obtained through this stability selection with minimax concave penalty approach.",2018,2018 IEEE Data Science Workshop (DSW)
A New View of Automatic Relevance Determination,"Automatic relevance determination (ARD) and the closely-related sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework are effective tools for pruning large numbers of irrelevant features leading to a sparse explanatory subset. However, popular update rules used for ARD are either difficult to extend to more general problems of interest or are characterized by non-ideal convergence properties. Moreover, it remains unclear exactly how ARD relates to more traditional MAP estimation-based methods for learning sparse representations (e.g., the Lasso). This paper furnishes an alternative means of expressing the ARD cost function using auxiliary functions that naturally addresses both of these issues. First, the proposed reformulation of ARD can naturally be optimized by solving a series of re-weighted l1 problems. The result is an efficient, extensible algorithm that can be implemented using standard convex programming toolboxes and is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum (or saddle point). Secondly, the analysis reveals that ARD is exactly equivalent to performing standard MAP estimation in weight space using a particular feature- and noise-dependent, non-factorial weight prior. We then demonstrate that this implicit prior maintains several desirable advantages over conventional priors with respect to feature selection. Overall these results suggest alternative cost functions and update procedures for selecting features and promoting sparse solutions in a variety of general situations. In particular, the methodology readily extends to handle problems such as non-negative sparse coding and covariance component estimation.",2007,
Gamma distribution linear modeling with statistical downscaling to predict extreme monthly rainfall in Indramayu,"Rainfall is an important factor in the agricultural process. Several methods to predict the rainfall have been carried out in Indonesia, such as the modeling of Statistical Downscaling (SDS). SDS models might involve ill-conditioned covariates (large dimension and high correlation/multi collinear). This problem could be solved by a variable selection technique such as L1 regularization/LASSO or a dimension reduction approach such as principal component analysis (PCA). In this paper, both methods were applied to generalized linear modeling with gamma distribution and compared in order to predict extreme monthly rainfall at 11 rain posts in Indramayu. Simulations were conducted to compare L1 regularization technique and principal component analysis in the prediction of responses. Two scenarios were based on the coefficient of beta and the distribution of response scenarios. The covariates used in this study were in observational data of GPCP version 2.2. The coefficient of beta scenarios were the combination of beta less than 1, equal 0, and greater than 1 vs all betas less than 1. Gamma distributions were used for distribution of response scenario with three different shape parameters. The simulation showed that L1 regularization technique resulted in almost better prediction than principal component analysis as the shape parameter was larger. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of generalized linear model with Gamma distribution was less than that of principal component regression. However, all generalized linear models with Gamma distribution gave the smaller RMSE values for extreme value prediction above outliers. In this case, the quantiles, Q(0.90) and Q(0.95), were better prediction of extreme monthly rainfall.",2016,"2016 12th International Conference on Mathematics, Statistics, and Their Applications (ICMSA)"
Radiomics models for diagnosing microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma: which model is the best model?,"ObjectivesTo explore the feasibility of diagnosing microvascular invasion (MVI) with radiomics, to compare the diagnostic performance of different models established by each method, and to determine the best diagnostic model based on radiomics.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted with 206 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) confirmed through surgery and pathology in our hospital from June 2015 to September 2018. Among the samples, 88 were MVI-positive, and 118 were MVI-negative. The radiomics analysis process included tumor segmentation, feature extraction, data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, modeling and model evaluation.ResultsA total of 1044 sets of texture feature parameters were extracted, and 21 methods were used for the radiomics analysis. All research methods could be used to diagnose MVI. Of all the methods, the LASSO+GBDT method had the highest accuracy, the LASSO+RF method had the highest sensitivity, the LASSO+BPNet method had the highest specificity, and the LASSO+GBDT method had the highest AUC. Through Z-tests of the AUCs, LASSO+GBDT, LASSO+K-NN, LASSO+RF, PCAâ€‰+â€‰DT, and PCAâ€‰+â€‰RF had Z-values greater than 1.96 (p<0.05). The DCA results showed that the LASSO + GBDT method was better than the other methods when the threshold probability was greater than 0.22.ConclusionsRadiomics can be used for the preoperative, noninvasive diagnosis of MVI, but different dimensionality reduction and modeling methods will affect the diagnostic performance of the final model. The model established with the LASSO+GBDT method had the optimal diagnostic performance and the greatest diagnostic value for MVI.",2019,Cancer Imaging
Gene prediction in heterogeneous cancer tissues and establishment of Least Absolute Shrinking and Selection Operator model of lung squamous cell carcinoma,"Background This study is aimed to establish a Least Absolute Shrinking and Selection Operator (LASSO) model based on tumor heterogeneity to predict the best features of LUSC in various cancer subtypes. Methods The RNASeq data of 505 LUSC cancer samples were downloaded from the TCGA database. Subsequent to the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the samples were divided into two subtypes based on the consensus clustering method. The subtypes were estimated with the abundance of immune and non-immune stromal cell populations which infiltrated tissue. LASSO model was established to predict each subtypeâ€™s best genes. Enrichment pathway analysis was then carried out. Finally, the validity of the LUSC model for identifying features was established by the survival analysis. Results 240 and 262 samples were clustered in Subtype-1 and Subtype-2 groups respectively. DEG analysis was performed on each subtype. A standard cutoff was applied and in total, 4586 genes were upregulated and 1495 were downregulated in case of subtype-1 and 5016 genes were upregulated and 3224 were downregulated in case of subtype-2. LASSO model was established to predict the best features from each subtypes, 49 and 34 most relevant genes were selected in subtype-1 and subtype-2. The abundance of tissue-infiltrates analysis distinguished the subtypes based on the expression pattern of immune infiltrates. Survival analysis showed that this model could effectively predict the best and distinct features in cancer subtypes. Discussion This study suggests that the unsupervised clustering and LASSO model-based feature selection can be effectively used to predict relevant genes which might play an important role in cancer diagnosis.",2019,bioRxiv

Parameter Reduction in Actuarial Triangle Models,"Very similar modeling is done for actuarial models in loss reserving and mortality projection. Both start with incomplete data rectangles, traditionally called triangles, and model by year of origin, year of observation, and lag from origin to observation. Actuaries using these models almost always use some form of parameter reduction as there are too many parameters to fit reliably, but usually this is an ad hoc exercise. Here we try two formal statistical approaches to parameter reduction, random effects and Lasso, and discuss methods of comparing goodness of fit.",2017,Social Science Research Network

The aim is to present a patient with a rare tumor called smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential. Case report: The reported patient was a 48-year-old male, subfebrile, with chest pain. Chest computed tomography showed a sharply limited cystic formation of the posterior mediastinum. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed outside compression in the middle third of the esophagus, and X-ray of the esophageal passage showed that the esophagus was pressed from the outside to the right and ventral. Bronchoscopy determined that the membranous part of the left main bronchus was slightly extramurally compressed. A left thoracotomy and an extirpation of the mediastinal tumor were performed. In pathohistology area of necrosis and tumor tissue composed of spindle cells were identified, which showed mild polymorphia. Immunohistochemical findings included positive smooth muscle actin (SMA) and desmin markers, negative S100 and CD34 markers, Ki-67 was 5.9%, and p16 was positive in more than 50% of tumor cells.

Learning to Discover Sparse Graphical Models,"We consider structure discovery of undirected graphical models from observational data. Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference procedures. In the setting of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) a popular estimator is a maximum likelihood objective with a penalization on the precision matrix. Adapting this estimator to capture domain-specific knowledge as priors or a new data likelihood requires great effort. In addition, structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function mapping from empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures. Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. We apply this framework to several real-world problems in structure discovery and show that it can be competitive to standard approaches such as graphical lasso, at a fraction of the execution speed. We use convolutional neural networks to parametrize our estimators due to the compositional structure of the problem. Experimentally, our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well to different data: identifying relevant edges in real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain competitive(and generally superior) performance, compared with analytical methods.",2017,
Minimax Semiparametric Learning With Approximate Sparsity,"Many objects of interest can be expressed as a linear, mean square continuous functional of a least squares projection (regression). Often the regression may be high dimensional, depending on many variables. This paper gives minimal conditions for root-n consistent and efficient estimation of such objects when the regression and the Riesz representer of the functional are approximately sparse and the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients is bounded. The approximately sparse functions we consider are those where an approximation by some $t$ regressors has root mean square error less than or equal to $Ct^{-\xi}$ for $C,$ $\xi>0.$ We show that a necessary condition for efficient estimation is that the sparse approximation rate $\xi_{1}$ for the regression and the rate $\xi_{2}$ for the Riesz representer satisfy $\max\{\xi_{1} ,\xi_{2}\}>1/2.$ This condition is stronger than the corresponding condition $\xi_{1}+\xi_{2}>1/2$ for Holder classes of functions. We also show that Lasso based, cross-fit, debiased machine learning estimators are asymptotically efficient under these conditions. In addition we show efficiency of an estimator without cross-fitting when the functional depends on the regressors and the regression sparse approximation rate satisfies $\xi_{1}>1/2$.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
"A MOM-based ensemble method for robustness, subsampling and hyperparameter tuning","Hyperparameters tuning and model selection are important steps in machine learning. Unfortunately, classical hyperparameter calibration and model selection procedures are sensitive to outliers and heavy-tailed data. In this work, we construct a selection procedure which can be seen as a robust alternative to cross-validation and is based on a median-of-means principle. Using this procedure, we also build an ensemble method which, trained with algorithms and corrupted heavy-tailed data, selects an algorithm, trains it with a large uncorrupted subsample and automatically tune its hyperparameters. The construction relies on a divide-and-conquer methodology, making this method easily scalable for autoML given a corrupted database. This method is tested with the LASSO which is known to be highly sensitive to outliers.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Sparse Networks Through Regularised Regressions,"We propose a Bayesian approach to the problem of variable selection and shrinkage in high dimensional sparse regression models where the regularisation method is an extension of a previous LASSO. The model allows us to include a large number of institutions which improves the identification of the relationship and maintains at the same time the flexibility of the univariate framework. Furthermore, we obtain a weighted directed network since the adjacency matrix is built â€œrow by rowâ€ using for each institutions the posterior inclusion probabilities of the other institutions in the system.",2018,
A Novel Graphical Lasso Based Approach Towards Segmentation Analysis in Energy Game-Theoretic Frameworks,"Energy game-theoretic frameworks have emerged to be a successful strategy to encourage energy efficient behavior in large scale by leveraging human-in-the-loop strategy. A number of such frameworks have been introduced over the years which formulate the energy saving process as a competitive game with appropriate incentives for energy efficient players. However, prior works involve an incentive design mechanism which is dependent on knowledge of utility functions for all the players in the game, which is hard to compute especially when the number of players is high, common in energy game-theoretic frameworks. Our research proposes that the utilities of players in such a framework can be grouped together to a relatively small number of clusters, and the clusters can then be targeted with tailored incentives. The key to above segmentation analysis is to learn the features leading to human decision making towards energy usage in competitive environments. We propose a novel graphical lasso based approach to perform such segmentation, by studying the feature correlations in a real-world energy social game dataset. To further improve the explainability of the model, we perform causality study using grangers causality. Proposed segmentation analysis results in characteristic clusters demonstrating different energy usage behaviors. We also present avenues to implement intelligent incentive design using proposed segmentation method.",2019,2019 18th IEEE International Conference On Machine Learning And Applications (ICMLA)

In this work, 15 calves, male or female, ages varying from five to six months experimentally submitted to calf roping were evaluated. The procedure was carried out three times per week, in alternated days, during five weeks, adding the total of 225 lassoes. The calves had been evaluated by means of general and neurological clinical examination at the beginning of the first week, during the third one and at the end of the fifth experimental week. Simple and contrasted x-rays of the cervical vertebrae had been made at the beginning of the first one and at the end of the fifth week of experiment. The lassoes methods had been observed and classified qualitatively in weak or strong. Clinical and radiographic alterations in the animals during the experiment had not been found. The severity of the lassoes was considered strong in 77% of the cases. The fact that clinical and radiographic abnormalities have not been found indicates that the occurrence of cervical injuries in calves submitted to calf roping is not as high as divulged, however, it was considered an aggressive and rude procedure.

Identification de biomarqueurs prÃ©dictifs dans un modÃ¨le de Cox Ã  haute dimension,"Introduction Avec lâ€™evolution recente de la genomique et de la medecine stratifiee dans les essais cliniques, un interet majeur en oncologie est de distinguer les patients qui sont susceptibles de repondre a un certain traitement de ceux qui ne le sont pas, afin de definir une population cible a traiter. Dâ€™un point de vue statistique, cela se traduit par la volonte dâ€™identifier des biomarqueurs qui interagissent avec le traitement. Peu de recherches se sont focalisees sur ce type de biomarqueur dit predictif dans le cadre dâ€™un modele de survie a haute dimension. Tres recemment, Tian et al. (2014) ont propose une approche simplifiee pour selectionner ces interactions a partir dâ€™une penalisation lasso (Â«Â least absolute shrinkage and selection operatorÂ Â») en lâ€™absence dâ€™effets propres. Methodes Nous evaluons lâ€™approche de Tian et al. via une etude de simulation et nous la comparons avec une approche alternative que nous proposons. Notre approche considere un modele complet (contenant le traitement, les biomarqueurs et les interactions) a deux etapes avec une penalisation ridge sur les effets propres des biomarqueurs et une penalisation lasso sur leurs interactions avec le traitement afin de selectionner les biomarqueurs ayant un effet predictif. Dâ€™autres approches sont egalement etudiees (composantes principales avec ou sans supervision sur les effets propres en combinaison de la selection lasso, deux termes dâ€™interaction sans effet propre). Nous evaluons egalement une nouvelleÂ extension consistant a penaliser la fonction de log-vraisemblance par validation croisee (PCVLÂ : Â«Â Penalized Cross Validated Log-likelihoodÂ Â») pour reduire le nombre de faux positifs. Nous comparons les differentes approches dans plusieurs scenarios nuls (aucun biomarqueur predictif) et alternatifs (au moins un biomarqueur predictif). Nous evaluons ces approches en termes de capacite de selection (taux de fausses decouvertes, taux de faux negatifs) et de prediction. Enfin, nous les appliquons sur un jeu de donnees dâ€™un essai clinique en oncologie contenant des donnees dâ€™expression de genes. Resultats Une etude preliminaire sur 500Â patients et 20Â biomarqueurs continus a ete realisee. Les resultats montrent que, sous lâ€™hypothese nulle, les differentes approches ont un taux de fausse decouverte relativement eleve. Celui-ci est legerement reduit pour lâ€™approche ridgeÂ +Â lasso (cvl ou pcvl). Sous lâ€™hypothese alternative, les approches de Tian et al. et ridgeÂ +Â lasso (cvl ou pcvl) ont un taux de faux negatif tres faible. Le taux de fausse decouverte est largement reduit avec lâ€™approche ridgeÂ +Â lasso (pcvl) en comparaison avec lâ€™approche de Tian et al. Les approches par composantes principales semblent peu performantes dans ce contexte. Une etude de simulation plus complete sera presentee lors de la conference. Conclusion A la vue des resultats preliminaires, lâ€™approche ridgeÂ +Â lasso (pcvl) semble etre une bonne alternative a lâ€™approche proposee par Tian et al. pour la detection de biomarqueurs predictifs dans un modele de Cox a haute dimension.",2015,Revue D Epidemiologie Et De Sante Publique
Genetic polymorphism in three species of tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) in Upper Volta.,"Natural populations of Glossina morsitans submorsitans Newstead, Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank and Glossina tachinoides Westwood occurring within 150 km of Bobo-Dioulasso, Upper Volta were examined using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No variation was found in the banding pattern for arginine phosphokinase (EC 2.7.3.3). G. p. gambiensis and G. tachinoides had three alleles for each of the thoracic enzymes octanol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.73), malic dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8) and for midgut alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1). The same situation was found with G. m. submorsitans except that only two alleles for alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and one for alkaline phosphatase were found. In each species, and for each of the enzymes, one allele was present at a frequency of 95% or greater. There was little or no variation between populations.

Bootstrap group penalty for highdimensional regression models,The paper presents a new penalization procedure for variable selection in regression models.We propose the Bootstrap Group Penalty (BGP) that extends the bootstrap version of the LASSO method by taking into account the grouping structure which may be present or introduced in a model.

Uniform Monte-Carlo Model Checking,"Grosu and Smolka have proposed a randomised Monte-Carlo algorithm for LTL model-checking. Their method is based on random exploration of the intersection of the model and of the Buchi automaton that represents the property to be checked. The targets of this exploration are so-called lassos, i.e. elementary paths followed by elementary circuits. During this exploration outgoing transitions are chosen uniformly at random. 
 
Grosu and Smolka note that, depending on the topology, the uniform choice of outgoing transitions may lead to very low probabilities of some lassos. In such cases, very big numbers of random walks are required to reach an acceptable coverage of lassos, and thus a good probability either of satisfaction of the property or of discovery of a counter-example. In this paper, we propose an alternative sampling strategy for lassos in the line of the uniform exploration of models presented in some previous work. 
 
The problem of finding all elementary cycles in a directed graph is known to be difficult: there is no hope for a polynomial time algorithm. Therefore, we consider a well-known sub-class of directed graphs, namely the reducible flow graphs, which correspond to well-structured programs and most control-command systems. 
 
We propose an efficient algorithm for counting and generating uniformly lassos in reducible flowgraphs. This algorithm has been implemented and experimented on a pathological example. We compare the lasso coverages obtained with our new uniform method and with uniform choice among the outgoing transitions.",2011,
