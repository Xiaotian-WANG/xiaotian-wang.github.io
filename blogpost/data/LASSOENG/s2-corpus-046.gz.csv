Confidence intervals of prediction accuracy measures for multivariable prediction models based on the bootstrap-based optimism correction methods,"In assessing prediction accuracy of multivariable prediction models, optimism corrections are essential for preventing biased results. However, in most published papers of clinical prediction models, the point estimates of the prediction accuracy measures are corrected by adequate bootstrap-based correction methods, but their confidence intervals are not corrected, e.g., the DeLongâ€™s confidence interval is usually used for assessing the Cstatistic. These naÃ¯ve methods do not adjust for the optimism bias and do not account for statistical variability in the estimation of parameters in the prediction models. Therefore, their coverage probabilities of the true value of the prediction accuracy measure can be seriously below the nominal level (e.g., 95%). In this article, we provide two generic bootstrap methods, namely (1) location-shifted bootstrap confidence intervals and (2) two-stage bootstrap confidence intervals, that can be generally applied to the bootstrapbased optimism correction methods, i.e., the Harrellâ€™s bias correction, 0.632, and 0.632+ methods. In addition, they can be widely applied to various methods for prediction model development involving modern shrinkage methods such as the ridge and lasso regressions. Through numerical evaluations by simulations, the proposed confidence intervals showed favourable coverage performances. Besides, the current standard practices based on the optimism-uncorrected methods showed serious undercoverage properties. To avoid erroneous results, the optimism-uncorrected confidence intervals should not be used in practice, and the adjusted methods are recommended instead. We also developed the R package predboot for implementing these methods (https://github.com/nomahi/predboot). The effectiveness of the proposed methods are illustrated via applications to the GUSTO-I clinical trial.",2020,
Assessing the relationship between form and use of different kinds of pottery from the archaeological site Sagalassos (southwest Turkey) with lipid analysis,Abstract Lipid extracts of different types of pottery from the archaeological site Sagalassos (southwest Turkey) were investigated using several analytical techniques. The usefulness of lipid analysis in the functional analysis of a broad spectrum of pottery from one archaeological site was evaluated. The results establish indeed a relationship between vessel use and form. Based on the analyses a determination table could be drawn relating vessel use and form and separating the different types of vessels. This research shows that lipid analysis can be a valuable contribution to classify different ceramic pots.,2004,Journal of Archaeological Science
LASSO-Driven Inference in Time and Space,"We consider the estimation and inference in a system of high-dimensional regression equations allowing for temporal and cross-sectional dependency in covariates and error processes, covering rather general forms of weak dependence. A sequence of large-scale regressions with LASSO is applied to reduce the dimensionality, and an overall penalty level is carefully chosen by a block multiplier bootstrap procedure to account for multiplicity of the equations and dependencies in the data. Correspondingly, oracle properties with a jointly selected tuning parameter are derived. We further provide high-quality de-biased simultaneous inference on the many target parameters of the system. We provide bootstrap consistency results of the test procedure, which are based on a general Bahadur representation for the Z-estimators with dependent data. Simulations demonstrate good performance of the proposed inference procedure. Finally, we apply the method to quantify spillover effects of textual sentiment indices in a financial market and to test the connectedness among sectors.",2018,arXiv: Econometrics
Dynamic Quantile Lasso Regression,"Quantile regression has been becoming a relevant and powerfult echnique to study the whole conditional distribution of a response variable without relying on strong assumptions about the underlying data generating process. Furthermore, quantile regression has been effectively used in many real applications, providing a representation of the relation between the response variable and the covariates, that overcomes traditional mean regression. In this paper, we consider a quantile regression model in which the regression coefï¬cients are assumed to evolve over time, following a stationary stochastic process. Furthermore, since homoskedastic quantile regression models result in location shifts of the regression hyperplane, we extend the timeâ€“varying parameter model to allow for heteroskedastic innovations. A dynamic version of the adaptiveâ€“Lasso penalty is then introduced to force the dynamic evolution of non relevant parameters to shrink towards zero. A simulation study is carried out to illustrate the model performances.",2016,
PopPhy-CNN: A Phylogenetic Tree Embedded Architecture for Convolution Neural Networks for Metagenomic Data,"Motivation Accurate prediction of the host phenotype from a metgenomic sample and identification of the associated bacterial markers are important in metagenomic studies. We introduce PopPhy-CNN, a novel convolutional neural networks (CNN) learning architecture that effectively exploits phylogentic structure in microbial taxa. PopPhy-CNN provides an input format of 2D matrix created by embedding the phylogenetic tree that is populated with the relative abundance of microbial taxa in a metagenomic sample. This conversion empowers CNNs to explore the spatial relationship of the taxonomic annotations on the tree and their quantitative characteristics in metagenomic data. Results PopPhy-CNN is evaluated using three metagenomic datasets of moderate size. We show the superior performance of PopPhy-CNN compared to random forest, support vector machines, LASSO and a baseline 1D-CNN model constructed with relative abundance microbial feature vectors. In addition, we design a novel scheme of feature extraction from the learned CNN models and demonstrate the improved performance when the extracted features are used to train support vector machines. Conclusion PopPhy-CNN is a novel deep learning framework for the prediction of host phenotype from metagenomic samples. PopPhy-CNN can efficiently train models and does not require excessive amount of data. PopPhy-CNN facilities not only retrieval of informative microbial taxa from the trained CNN models but also visualization of the taxa on the phynogenetic tree.

Online adaptive method for disease prediction based on big data of clinical laboratory test,"To better utilize the medical data in electronic medical records (EMR), this study aims to present an online adaptive method for disease prediction based on the medical data of clinical laboratory test (CLT) items stored in EMR. We firstly extract the diagnosis and CLT items information from the system, and then divide the CLT items into three categories to establish the patterns of CLT items, which are subsequently used for the selection of candidate diseases. A binary relevance approach based on logistic sparse group lasso method is finally used for disease prediction. Four groups of 21,288 patients with diagnosis of chronic hepatitis, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia and random diseases are used to test the performance of our method. Results show that the accuracy and recall for these four groups are all above 70%. As a primary attempt to practice intelligent healthcare, this model may have the potential values of computer-aided diagnosis. Further studies are suggested to combine CLT with other types of EMR data to further improve the prediction performance.",2016,2016 7th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science (ICSESS)
A Geometric Approach to Subset Selection and Sparse Sufficient Dimension Reduction,"Sufficient dimension reduction methods allow to estimate lower dimensional subspaces while retaining most of the information about the regression of a response variable on a set of predictors. However, it may happen that only a subset of the predictors is needed. We propose a geometric approach to subset selection by imposing sparsity constraints on some coefficients. The proposed method can be applied to most existing dimension reduction methods, such as sliced inverse regression and sliced average variance estimation, and may help to improve the estimation accuracy and facilitate interpretation. Simulation studies are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method applied to two popular dimension reduction methods, namely SIR and SAVE, and a comparison is made with LASSO and stepwise OLS regression.",2011,

Developing and Marketing a Faith-Based Practice: Mission and Business,"Providing faith oriented services to the psychotherapy consumer presents challenges for the integration of faith with the business of managing a clinical practice. Using both American and Canadian experience, we are proposing that a faith based clinical practice is a viable model for providing professional clinical services. As clinicians interested in integrating their spirituality in the therapeutic relationship, we will address some of the practical issues confronting those who offer spiritual resources in clinical settings. The Economic Climate Clinicians are not used to thinking that in economic terms, psychotherapy is a discretionary service. It is our experience that there is a strong correlation between the availability of discretionary household income and the choice to enter psychotherapy. In a tight economy people will choose to spend their income on meeting basic needs rather than on luxury products and services. Canadian studies have estimated that nearly one in five Canadian adults will personally experience a mental illness during a 1 year period (Health Canada, 2002). People in the United States with low incomes and no insurance are nearly twice as likely as the general population to be diagnosed with mental illness (Mauksch et al., 2001). Governments and insurance or managed care companies make similar economic decisions. When money is tight, mental health needs receive lower priority even though the tight economy puts more pressure and stress on the part of the population that is vulnerable. According to the Psychotherapy Finances' 2000 survey, income from psychotherapy was very stable in the 1990's, but the income of psychotherapists has dropped by 22% since 2000. Three reasons for the change in the economics of clinical practice were identified. First is the introduction of managed care in the United States. Managed care treats psychotherapy as a commodity. Based on diagnosis, a specific therapeutic regime is prescribed and a length of treatment is expected without regard to either the specific circumstances of the patient or the unique qualifications of the therapist. In a mature market place where overall product quality is high and where there is an abundance of trained clinicians, product differentiation is determined by price and psychotherapy becomes a commodity. Managed care companies are paying between $00 to $75 per session and capping the number of treatment sessions. The therapist's credentials and qualifications are secondary in an empirically based treatment approach. The second economic factor is the erosion of self paying clients. According to the Psychotherapy Finances data, self paying clients were averaging 44% of a clinical practice in the 1990's but have declined to about 20% of a clinical practice at present. The specific economic circumstances of the geographic area of your practice may make a difference; your practice economics will be different depending on whether your local economy is growing or in distress. Third, the overhead costs of maintaining a practice have not gone down. About 30% to 45% of the income from your practice goes to keeping the lights on. The costs of insurance, professional accreditation and ongoing training are not going down. Clinical practice is a business, as well as mission driven, and the economics of psychotherapy matter. Developing a clinical practice that provides a living wage has been a challenge since professional psychotherapy first began. Freud acknowledged the challenges of economic fluctuations in his practice. In a letter to Wilhelm Fliess in 1899, Freud wrote: My mood also depends very strongly on my earnings. Money is a laughing gas for me. I know from my youth that once the wild horses of the pampas have been lassoed, they retain a certain anxiousness for life. Thus I came to know the helplessness of poverty and continually fear it. You will see that my style will improve and my ideas will be more correct if this city provides me with an ample livelihood. â€¦",2007,Journal of Psychology and Christianity
Amaroxocanes A and B: sulfated dimeric sterols defend the Caribbean coral reef sponge Phorbas amaranthus from fish predators.,"Two new dimeric steroids, amaroxocanes A (1) and B (2), were isolated from Phorbas amaranthus collected on shallow coral reefs off Key Largo, Florida. The two compounds are comprised of two sulfated sterol cores bridged by an oxocane formed by different oxidative side-chain fusions. The structures were characterized by interpretation of MS and NMR spectroscopic data. The compounds are the primary components of a fraction that deters feeding of the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, in aquarium assays. When the pure compounds were assayed at eight times the natural concentration, amaroxocane B (2) was found to be an effective antifeedant, but A (1) was not.",2009,Journal of natural products
Marine psychrophile-derived cold-active polygalacturonase: Enhancement of productivity in Thalassospira frigidphilosprofundus S3BA12 by whole cell immobilization,"Abstract The productivity of cold-active polygalacturonase (PGase) in a newly identified marine psychrophile, Thalassospira frigidphilosprofundus S3BA12, was increased multifold by employing high-cell-density (HCD) culturing in a simulation-assisted, custom-designed single-stage-continuous immobilized reactor. The reactor was made â€œhalophilic culturingâ€ ready by using surface altered polyurethane foam (PUF) as a matrix, and it was uniquely packed with layers of â€œspacersâ€ to increase robustness towards high salinity, prevent salt deposition and dissociation of cells. The basic limitation of low growth of a marine organism was overcome in this study, where HCD resulted in a 4-fold increase of cell mass from 0.84 dcw g/L in submerged culture to 3.22â€‰g/L, which commensurately increased the PGase titre from 21.0 U/ml to 85.25 U/ml. The culture was sustained for 108â€‰h, continuously producing PGase at a rate of 7.87 U/ml hrâˆ’1. This could be the highest reported cold-active PGase by any psychrophilic organism reported to date. A mechanistic modelling approach was used to develop a simulation of the process in ChemCAD 5.0, which can be used as a basis for scale-up studies. This study proved statistically that PGase titre is significantly dependent on cell mass using Anderson-Darlington normality tests and established a correlation between PGase and other pectinase subtypes using Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient analysis.",2019,Biochemical Engineering Journal
Field Detection of Phytopathogenic Bacteria by Bioluminescence,"Genetic marker systems for tracking microbes released into the environment have greatly increased our ability to assess microbial dispersal and survival and the risks associated with the release of genetically engineered microorganisms. Transgenic incorporation of the luxCDABE operon from Vibrio fischeri into phytopathogenic bacteria has been used successfully to visualize and determine bacterial colonization in and on plants using a computer-assisted, charge-oupled device (CCD) camera. The dispersal and persistence of bioluminescent Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, causal agent of black rot disease of cabbage, were studied in the field environment in accordance with a USDNAPHIS biotechnology permit. Bioluminescent bacteria in environmental samples were detected with the CCD camera or through bioluminescence measurements of broth enrichment cultures. Colonization of plants with bioluminescent X campestris pv. campestris fluctuated with environmental conditions and persistence was coupled with the host's growing season. Dispersal to alternative hosts such as weeds was detected, while movement and persistence in the rhizosphere were limited. Horizontal transfer of the luxoperon into other leafor soilassociated bacteria was not detected.",2019,

Dilatometric tests combined with computer simulations and parameter identification for in-depth diagnostic analysis of concrete dams,"Diagnostic analysis of dams means here assessment of possible structural damages (due to, e.g., alkali-silica reaction in concrete). Such damages may be primarily self-equilibrated stresses due to material expansion, elastic stiffness degradation, decrease of compressive and tensile strength, and of fracture energy. The procedure presented in this paper is intended to perform such diagnosis deep inside the concrete dam and is based on â€˜â€˜ad hocâ€™â€™ devised substantially novel mechanical experiments, on their finite element modelling and on deterministic parameter identification through the minimization of the discrepancy norm between measured quantities and their counterparts computed as functions of the sought parameters. 1 PRELIMINARY REMARKS In present dam engineering the assessment of possibly deteriorated material properties and of the stress state, both in dam concrete and in foundation rocks, is necessary in order to compute the present safety factors with respect to various kinds of possible failures. Typical structural problems in concrete dam engineering are dealt with e.g. in Pedro (1999) and Bourdarot et al. (1994). As for diagnostic analysis of possible damages in concrete dams (due to alkali-silica reactions and/or extreme loads like exceptional floods and earthquakes), the following methodological classification can provide a concise overview, see e.g. Maier et al. (2004), Fedele et al. (2006): (a) overall dynamic excitation and accelerometric measurements; (b) hydrostatical loading due to seasonal variations of reservoir level and measurement of consequent displacements by pendula, collimators, and, recently, radar; (c) same as at (b), but with â€˜â€˜fastâ€™â€™ hydrostatical loading performed by â€˜â€˜ad hocâ€™â€™ changes of the reservoir level; (d) local, traditional flat-jack tests on dam surface and extensimetric or, in the future, â€˜â€˜digital image correlationâ€™â€™ measurements; (e) traditional â€˜â€˜overcoringâ€™â€™ for damage and stress assessment in-depth. Overall diagnosis procedures are clearly limited to the assessment of elastic stiffness distribution; the statical approaches provide more data if radar is employed and are especially inexpensive if seasonal. Local tests are needed in order to assess fairly accurately stress states and inelastic material properties. In this paper a new methodology is proposed in order to perform diagnostic analyses locally, in-depth and in a relatively inexpensive and non-destructive fashion. The diagnostic method here presented, inspired by the traditional overcoring technique but substantially different from it, is centered on inverse analyses and is articulated in the operative phases specified in the subsequent Section. The in-depth material characterization has been, since several decades, a research subject, particularly in rock mechanics, and a widely employed practice in geotechnical engineering. Wittke (1990) and SjÃ¶berg & Klasson (2003) can be regarded as representative references to the relevant vast literature. 2 OUTLINE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND RELATED PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION The operative phases of the proposed diagnostic method are listed below and schematically illustrated in Figure 1. a. A hole is drilled in the dam (Figure 1a). b. A device called â€˜â€˜dilatometerâ€™â€™ is inserted in it. The dilatometer basically consists of two sleeves equipped with radial displacement gouges and, between them, of two movable steel â€˜â€˜archesâ€™â€™ (Figure 1b). c. The drilling goes ahead, making the hole longer, while the gouges measure the displacements due",2008,

Isotonic Modeling with Non-Differentiable Loss Functions with Application to Lasso Regularization,"In this paper we present an algorithmic approach for fitting isotonic models under convex, yet non-differentiable, loss functions. It is a generalization of the greedy non-regret approach proposed by Luss and Rosset (2014) for differentiable loss functions, taking into account the sub-gradiental extensions required. We prove that our suggested algorithm solves the isotonic modeling problem while maintaining favorable computational and statistical properties. As our suggested algorithm may be used for any nondifferentiable loss function, we focus our interest on isotonic modeling for either regression or two-class classification with appropriate log-likelihood loss and lasso penalty on the fitted values. This combination allows us to maintain the non-parametric nature of isotonic modeling, while controlling model complexity through regularization. We demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of this approach on both synthetic and real world data. An implementation of our suggested solution is publicly available from the first author's website (https://sites.google.com/site/amichaipainsky/software).",2016,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
Data-driven Optimal Cost Selection for Distributionally Robust Optimization,"Recently, (Blanchet, Kang, and Murhy 2016, and Blanchet, and Kang 2017) showed that several machine learning algorithms, such as square-root Lasso, Support Vector Machines, and regularized logistic regression, among many others, can be represented exactly as distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems. The distributional uncertainty is defined as a neighborhood centered at the empirical distribution. We propose a methodology which learns such neighborhood in a natural data-driven way. We show rigorously that our framework encompasses adaptive regularization as a particular case. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that our proposed methodology is able to improve upon a wide range of popular machine learning estimators.",2017,arXiv: Machine Learning
Decomposition feature selection with applications in detecting correlated biomarkers of bipolar disorders.,"Feature selection is an important initial step of exploratory analysis in biomedical studies. Its main objective is to eliminate the covariates that are uncorrelated with the outcome. For highly correlated covariates, traditional feature selection methods, such as the Lasso, tend to select one of them and eliminate the others, although some of the eliminated ones are still scientifically valuable. To alleviate this drawback, we propose a feature selection method based on covariate space decomposition, referred herein as the ""Decomposition Feature Selection"" (DFS), and show that this method can lead to scientifically meaningful results in studies with correlated high dimensional data. The DFS consists of two steps: (i) decomposing the covariate space into disjoint subsets such that each of the subsets contains only uncorrelated covariates and (ii) identifying significant predictors by traditional feature selection within each covariate subset. We demonstrate through simulation studies that the DFS has superior practical performance over the Lasso type methods when multiple highly correlated covariates need to be retained. Application of the DFS is demonstrated through a study of bipolar disorders with correlated biomarkers.",2019,Statistics in medicine
Uniformly valid confidence sets based on the Lasso,"In a linear regression model of fixed dimension $p \leq n$, we construct confidence regions for the unknown parameter vector based on the Lasso estimator that uniformly and exactly hold the prescribed in finite samples as well as in an asymptotic setup. We thereby quantify estimation uncertainty as well as the ""post-model selection error"" of this estimator. More concretely, in finite samples with Gaussian errors and asymptotically in the case where the Lasso estimator is tuned to perform conservative model selection, we derive exact formulas for computing the minimal coverage probability over the entire parameter space for a large class of shapes for the confidence sets, thus enabling the construction of valid confidence regions based on the Lasso estimator in these settings. The choice of shape for the confidence sets and comparison with the confidence ellipse based on the least-squares estimator is also discussed. Moreover, in the case where the Lasso estimator is tuned to enable consistent model selection, we give a simple confidence region with minimal coverage probability converging to one. Finally, we also treat the case of unknown error variance and present some ideas for extensions.",2018,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Super-resolution for facial image using multilateral affinity function,"In this paper, a patch-based super-resolution (SR) method is proposed to hallucinate facial images, where the image patches are selected and weighted based on a multilateral affinity function (MAF). Inspired by the property of human faces, we design the MAF by combining four parts, each of which is also an affinity function and inspired from different insights. The first part describes the similarity of two patches by their appearances. The second one takes the probable positions of patches into account. The third part incorporates the global information of faces by Lasso regression. The fourth one includes the information of significant facial components. Through the data consistency constraint, weights of training patches are calculated from MAF. The final SR results are obtained by the stitching of inferred HR patches and a post-processing. The experiments on two public databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over some state-of-the-art methods via various criteria. The feasibility of our method in the real-world scenario is also demonstrated experimentally.",2014,Neurocomputing
Graph-Based Representation and Reasoning,"Ontologies can be viewed as the middle layer between pure human conceptualization and machine readability. However, they have not lived up to their promises so far. Most ontologies are too tailored to specific data and use-cases. By making sometimes strong, or sometimes too weak, ontological commitments, many existing ontologies do not adequatly reflect human conceptualizations. As a result, sharing and reuse of ontologies is greatly inhibited. In order to more effectively preserve this notion of human conceptualization, an ontology should be designed with modularity and extensibility in mind. A modular ontology thus may act as a bridge between human conceptualization and data. 1 The Case for Modular Ontologies The Internet is the single largest repository of knowledge to have ever existed and continues to grow every second. The amount of data continuously generated by both humans and machines defies comprehension: from second-by-second meteorological data gathered by sensors to academic articles written by scientists to communications on social media networks to collaborative articles on Wikipedia. How can we represent and link these disparate forms of data together in order to generate an understandable gestalt? We would require a way to organize acquired data such that some critical part of the human conceptualization of each piece is preserved. Ontologies, as â€œexplicit specifications of conceptualizations,â€ seem like a natural fit for the role [2]. With the explosive growth of the Semantic Web in the last decade, it would seem that they have seen no small success for that purpose. Ontologies offer a human accessible organization of immense amounts of data and act as a vehicle for the sharing and reuse of knowledge. Unfortunately, published ontologies have often not lived up to these promises. Large, monolithic ontologies, designed with very strong â€“ or very weak â€“ ontological commitments are very difficult to reuse across the same domain, let alone different domains. Strong ontological commitments lead to overspecification, to ontologies essentially being only fit for the singular purpose for which they were originally designed. Weak ones lead to ambiguity of the model, sometimes to the extent that is hard to grasp what is actually being modeled. c Â© Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018 P. Chapman et al. (Eds.): ICCS 2018, LNAI 10872, pp. 3â€“6, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-91379-7_1 4 P. Hitzler and C. Shimizu Fig. 1. This is a graphical view of the MicroblogEntry ODP [12]. Yellow boxes indicate datatypes, light blue boxes with dashed borders indicate external patterns. Purple is used for external classes belonging to PROV-O [1]. Green is used for external classes belonging to [8]. White arrowheads represent the owl:SubclassOf relation. (Color figure online) We posit that one effective way to obtain ontologies which are easier to reuse, is to build them in a modular fashion. A sufficiently modularized ontology [9] is designed such that individual users can easily adapt an ontology to their use cases, while maintaining integration and relationships with other versions of the ontology. A modular ontology is constructed by piecing together so-called ontology modules. Ontology modules are created by adapting Ontology Design Patterns to the domain and use-case [4,5]. 2 Ontology Design Patterns In general, patterns are invariances that may be observed over different media (e.g. data or processes). Ontology Design Patterns (ODP) are the recognition of conceptual patterns that occur across different domains. Modeling with ODPs has established itself as an ontology engineering paradigm [5]. The Semantic Trajectory ODP [7] is a classic example of a recurring pattern. However, patterns are designed to be sufficiently general as to apply to many different cases as possible. Thus, it is necessary to create a module from them by adapting the pattern to the specific domain and use-case in mind. The Semantic Trajectory ODP has been successfully modularized a number of times; two prominent examples are the CruiseTrajectory ODP [11] and the SpatiotemporalExtent ODP [10]. For a thorough tutorial on creating modules out of patterns, see [9]. As another example, Fig. 1 shows a graphical representation of the MicroblogEntry ODP [12]. This ODP clearly demonstrates pattern reuse and how adequate ontological commitment eases of modularization. This ODP was Modular Ontologies as a Bridge 5 engineered to leverage as much existing work as possible. For example, the Media and ReportingEvent concepts are defined in [8]. The concepts Entity and Agent come from the popular PROV Ontology that express provenance data [1]. Further, this ODP avoids overly strong ontological commitments, allowing it to be easily modularized to represent specific microblogs (e.g. Twitter vs. Facebook vs. Instagram). 3 The Future of Modular Ontology Engineering The promise of modular ontologies is still being realized. There are yet open questions concerning ontology design patterns, their usage, and the surrounding supporting tools and infrastructure. For a more thorough examination of these questions and challenges, see [3]. That is not to say that there are no efforts underway; here, we briefly identify some of these ongoing efforts. Perhaps the most fundamental purpose of the Semantic Web is to enable the sharing and reuse of knowledge. Certainly, a pattern is knowledge in and of itself. Thus, it is only reasonable that there needs to be a way to enable the sharing and reuse of patterns, as well. To do so, we are working towards the development of a â€œsmart,â€ central repository. Such a repository would be initially populated with a critical mass of fundamental ODPs. That is, a collection of ODPs with sufficient breadth and generalization such that their combination covers any complex conceptualization. In addition, these patterns will be annotated in a systematic and rigorous way. Answering questions such as â€“ How do patterns interact with each other? â€“ Do they import other patterns? â€“ Which pattern did this module reuse as a template? Recently, [6] introduced the Ontology Design Pattern Representation Language (OPLa) as a way to address those questions, and others. The smart repository would use these OPLa annotations in order to inform an ontology engineer on available patterns, especially those related to their domain and use-cases. Between the central repository and OPLa, the next step will be to create a graphical interface for the assembly and modularization of ontologies. This will be a combination of different visualization strategies and a plug-and-play system for ODPs. And finally, as we learn how to most help humans create ontologies, can we attempt to also automate these processes? That is, automatically create an ontology from a dataset and present it as a â€œfirst draftâ€ to the ontology engineer for editing? Acknowledgement.

Electronic libraries in partnership: BEEP for Africa,"Introduction Between September 2008 and September 2009, ERD (Research Institute for Development)1 established a programme of scanning workshops within the SIST project (System for Scientific and Technical Information)2 of MAEE (French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs)3. This initiative involved documentation centers and libraries of public institutions (Universities, Research Institutes) in several French-speaking African countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Madagascar, Niger, Senegal, Tunisia). The programme enabled the purchase of scanning equipment (fast A4 scanners, PCs, dedicated software) and training teams to digitise documents (theses, articles, books) produced by the staff (researchers, engineers, students) of participating institutions. The Greenstone software4 was chosen to provide access, over the Internet, to the collections of digital materials. All teams were trained in the installation, administration and use of this tool. The collections made by the project participants consist of documents in pdf format. Metadata is made available either by incorporating existing bibliographic databases (usually in the CDS /ISIS5 format) or by direct input into the metadata fields of digital files. In the latter case, the metadata entries include document title, authors, publication date and subject. The project scope was to digitise, enhance and make accessible on the Internet the scientific works of a wide range of institutions from developing countries. Concretely, this initiative organised 30 digitisation workshops in six countries. About 100 people were trained in the methodologies of scanning and creating digital libraries using the Greenstone software. The overall cost of this project (equipment, missions, training, expertise) was 145,000 euros. Electronic libraries and internet servers: BEEP for Africa The SIST project also funded the establishment of Internet servers (one server for each country) for sharing scientific information and hosting electronic libraries created with the Greenstone software. These computers were funded by another component of the SIST project. The operability of these countries' SIST servers often met with structural problems that limited their connectivity: low bandwidth, server downtime, frequent power outages, a complex implementation of IT projects. In an attempt to provide concrete answers to these difficulties, the ERD installed the BEEP (Bibliotheques electroniques en partenariat) server. This server is located in France, on Bondy ERD site. Its uri is www.beep.ird.fr. BEEP offers several SIST partner institutions temporary hosting of their electronic document collections. This offer is maintained until permanent solutions can be found locally. This is a cooperative approach that brings together the ERD and partners in developing countries. These institutions desire to share their publications, making them quickly accessible to the scientific communities of the internet world. Collections can be built by each partner with Greenstone on a desktop computer, by a local administrator trained by the project. The file system generated by Greenstone is then transferred, without any modification, to the administrator of BEEP. In other cases, the ERD is involved in the application design: pdf file collections and logos are transferred to the administrator of BEEP and the collection is built in Bondy. The server uses a Linux version of Greenstone, but collections are created on Windows computers. Greenstone collections can be built in a specific environment but operate and be made available on all systems for which a version of the software exists. BEEP currently hosts the following collections: Reports of the National land management project (PNGT2), Burkina Faso (37 documents). * Dissertations and theses of the Polytechnic University, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso (455 documents). * Reports of the Ministry of Agriculture, Burkina Faso (26 documents). â€¦",2011,African research & documentation
Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rigidity: Relation to Brain Connectivity and Motor Performance,"OBJECTIVE
(1) To determine the brain connectivity pattern associated with clinical rigidity scores in Parkinson's disease (PD) and (2) to determine the relation between clinically assessed rigidity and quantitative metrics of motor performance.


BACKGROUND
Rigidity, the resistance to passive movement, is exacerbated in PD by asking the subject to move the contralateral limb, implying that rigidity involves a distributed brain network. Rigidity mainly affects subjects when they attempt to move; yet the relation between clinical rigidity scores and quantitative aspects of motor performance are unknown.


METHODS
Ten clinically diagnosed PD patients (off-medication) and 10 controls were recruited to perform an fMRI squeeze-bulb tracking task that included both visually guided and internally guided features. The direct functional connectivity between anatomically defined regions of interest was assessed with Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). Tracking performance was assessed by fitting Linear Dynamical System (LDS) models to the motor performance, and was compared to the clinical rigidity scores. A cross-validated Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression method was used to determine the brain connectivity network that best predicted clinical rigidity scores.


RESULTS
The damping ratio of the LDS models significantly correlated with clinical rigidity scores (pâ€‰=â€‰0.014). An fMRI connectivity network in subcortical and primary and premotor cortical regions accurately predicted clinical rigidity scores (pâ€‰<â€‰10(-5)).


CONCLUSION
A widely distributed cortical/subcortical network is associated with rigidity observed in PD patients, which reinforces the importance of altered functional connectivity in the pathophysiology of PD. PD subjects with higher rigidity scores tend to have less overshoot in their tracking performance, and damping ratio may represent a robust, quantitative marker of the motoric effects of increasing rigidity.",2013,Frontiers in Neurology
Predicting Mitochondrial tRNA Modification,"M itochondria are integral to proper cell function, and mutations in its small genome (mtDNA) are associated with many diseases, along with the progression of normal aging [9]. While mtDNA has been extensively studied, not much is known about transcriptional variations of mitochondrial genes [3]. Recently, tRNA modifications have been the focus of intense study owing to their putative role in diseases [4]. Identifying genes responsible for mitochondrial tRNA modification is an important step towards a better understanding of transcriptional variation. To the best of my knowledge, a machine learning approach has never been utilized in order to identify such genes. Here, I used penalized linear regression to predict tRNA modification activity using gene expression as features. After controlling for confounding factors, I was able to predict modification activity at several putative modified tRNA positions. These models explained between 19% and 51% of the variance. Most notably, I used preconditioned lasso [7] which yielded four promising gene candidates that affect tRNA modification: ALKBH8 (an E. coli homolog DNA repair enzyme), MAD2L1 Binding Protein, C1orf103 (an open reading frame gene with unknown function), and TRMT5 (tRNA methyltransferase 5).",2014,
"Functional Treatment of Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture. A Histological, Immunohistological and Ultrasonographic Analisis in the Experiment","SummaryIn 105 rabbits the course of healing was examined at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks (21 rabbits per group) after an experimental Achilles tendon rupture. The following treatment modalities were compared: a. operative functional treatment (resorbable suture, Kleinert technique) b. operative functional treatment with fibrin glue c. primary functional treatment. For the functional (after)-treatment a special orthosis was applied. A 7,5 MHz Ultrasound probe was used for the ultrasonographic evaluation. The histological specimens were stained after Masson-Goldner with Azan. Collagen Type III was depicted immunhistologically with polyclonale antibodies. A semiquantitative fibrocytes count was performed. The histological results showed a smooth healing in the prim. functional treatment group, reaching parallel orientation of collagen fibers at 12 weeks. In the fibrin glue-group the fibrin was resorbed after 4 weeks without essential influence to the course of healing. In the suture-group a secondary gapping of the tendon stumps was detectable. At 12 weeks the histological evaluation in all groups showed approximately normal tendon pattern. Immunohistochemically all groups showed cell-associated positive reactions for type III-collagen after 1 week with a maximum after 2 weeks. The semiquantitative fibrocyte count in the primary funct. group showed a maximal number after 1 week, in the fibrin glue- and suture-groups the maximal number could be found after 2 weeks. Sonographically an increase in tendon thickness was detectable up to the 4th weeks in all groups. The secondary gapping of the tendon stumps in the suture group could be detected sonographically. The echogenicity of the tendon during the course of healing showed increasing homogeneity and parallelism in all groups. At 12 weeks the echogenicity was comparable in all groups. The experiment could prove the equivalence of the primary functional treatment to operative therapy in Achilles tendon rupture.ZusammenfassungAn 105 Kaninchen wurde der Heilungsverlauf der frischen Achillessehnenruptur nach 1, 2, 4, 8 und 12 Wochen untersucht (21 Tiere/Gruppe). Folgende Behandlungsregime wurden miteinander verglichen: operativ-funktionelle Behandlung (resorbierbare Naht, Kleinert-Technik), operativ-funktionelle Behandlung mit Fibrinkleber und die primÃ¤r-funktionelle Behandlung. Zur funktionellen Nachbehandlung wurde eine Spezialorthese entwickelt. Die sonographische Untersuchung erfolgte mit einem 7,5-MHz-Schallkopf. Die histologischen PrÃ¤parate wurden nach Masson-Goldner und mit Azan gefÃ¤rbt. Typ-III-Kollagen wurde immunhistochemisch mit polyklonalem AntikÃ¶rper dargestellt. Semiquantitative FibrozytenzÃ¤hlungen wurden in einer ZÃ¤hlkammer durchgefÃ¼hrt. Lichtmikroskopisch zeigte sich in der primÃ¤r funktionellen Behandlungsgruppe ein ungestÃ¶rter Heilungsablauf mit einer Ausbildung paralleler Kollagenfasern nach 12 Wochen. In der Fibringruppe wurde das Fibrin innerhalb der ersten 4 Wochen resorbiert ohne das Ergebnis positiv zu beeinflussen. In der Nahtgruppe zeigte sich ein sekundÃ¤res Auseinanderweichen der Naht. In beiden Gruppen wurde nach 12 Wochen annÃ¤hernd das gleiche histologische Bild wie in der primÃ¤r-funktionellen konservativen Gruppe erreicht. Immunhistochemisch fanden sich in allen 3 Gruppen nach einer Woche zellassoziierte positive Reaktionen fÃ¼r Typ-III-Kollagen mit einem Maximum nach 2 Wochen. Bei der semiquantitativen FibrozytenzÃ¤hlung trat die maximale Fibrozytenzahl in der primÃ¤r funkt. Behandlungsgruppe nach einer Woche auf. In der Naht- und in der Fibringruppe traten die maximalen Fibrozytenzahlen nach 2 Wochen auf. In der sonographischen Dickemessung wurde in allen Gruppen eine Zunahme der Regeneratdicke bis 4 Wochen nach Tenotomie gefunden. Danach nahm die Sehnendicke wieder ab. Das sekundÃ¤re Auseinanderweichen der Naht in der operativ-funktionellen Gruppe konnte auch sonographisch bestÃ¤tigt werden. Die sonographischen Kontrolluntersuchungen zeigten eine zunehmende Homogenisierung der Binnenechos im Verlauf. Nach 12 Wochen zeigt sich in allen 3 Gruppen ein annÃ¤hernd gleiches Binnenechomuster. Das Experiment bestÃ¤tigt die Gleichwertigkeit der primÃ¤r funktionellen Behandlung gegenÃ¼ber operativer Behandlungsmethoden.",2016,Der Unfallchirurg

A Coordinate-Descent-Based Approach to Solving the Sparse Group Elastic Net,"ABSTRACTGroup sparse approaches to regression modeling are finding ever increasing utility in an array of application areas. While group sparsity can help assess certain data structures, it is desirable in many instances to also capture element-wise sparsity. Recent work exploring the latter has been conducted in the context of l2/l1 penalized regression in the form of the sparse group lasso (SGL). Here, we present a novel model, called the sparse group elastic net (SGEN), which uses an lâˆž/l1/ridge-based penalty. We show that the lâˆž-norm, which induces group sparsity is particularly effective in the presence of noisy data. We solve the SGEN model using a coordinate descent-based procedure and compare its performance to the SGL and related methods in the context of hyperspectral imaging in the presence of noisy observations. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",2017,Technometrics
Î©-Automata: A Coalgebraic Perspective on Regular Ï‰-Languages,"In this work, we provide a simple coalgebraic characterisation of regular Ï‰-languages based on languages of lassos, and prove a number of related mathematical results, framed into the theory of a new kind of automata called Î©-automata. In earlier work we introduced Î©-automata as two-sorted structures that naturally operate on lassos, pairs of words encoding ultimately periodic streams (infinite words). Here we extend the scope of these Î©-automata by proposing them as a new kind of acceptor for arbitrary streams. We prove that Î©-automata are expressively complete for the regular Ï‰-languages. We show that, due to their coalgebraic nature, Î©-automata share some attractive properties with deterministic automata operating on finite words, properties that other types of stream automata lack. In particular, we provide a simple, coalgebraic definition of bisimilarity between Î©-automata that exactly captures language equivalence and allows for a simple minimization procedure. We also prove a coalgebraic Myhill-Nerode style theorem for lasso languages, and use this result, in combination with a closure property on stream languages called lasso determinacy, to give a characterization of regular Ï‰-languages. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computationâ†’ Formal languages and automata theory; Theory of computation â†’ Automata over infinite objects",2019,
A multicentric study of long-term rhythm patterns in heart rate,"Heart rate (HR) shows oscillations with different periods as a result of the sympatho-vagal balance. The most studied ones are short-period variations and the circadian pattern. However, the existence of rhythms of longer periods has not been systematically studied. The aim of this work is to study HR long-period rhythms in a multicentric database including 336 patients in sinus rhythm, with implanted cardioverter defibrillator. We used two methodological approaches: First a rhythmometric procedure to automatically select the statistically significant rhythms present in the signal; Second, the LASSO path approach to analyze the order of activation of the rhythms, representing the importance of each rhythm. Most of the population showed a significant annual rhythm (78% day/80% night). Weekly and quarterly rhythms were also present (weekly 26% /26%; quarterly 22%/21%). Monthly rhythm was rarely present. Most present rhythm combinations were annual plus weekly (21%/21%) and annual plus quarterly (19%/18%). The order of activation given by the LASSO path was in agreement with the multicomponent rhythmometric model in the 86%/85% of the cases. The unusual long monitoring period, and the high number of patients, represent an ideal scenario to robustly assess the existence of long-term rhythms.",2016,2016 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)
Genomic Selection of Forage Quality Traits in Winter Wheat,"Phenotyping forage quality traits is timeconsuming in forage wheat breeding. In this study, prediction accuracies of three genomic selection (GS) models (ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction [RRBLUP], Gaussian kernel [GAUSS], and Bayesian LASSO [BL, where LASSO stands for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator]) for forage quality traits of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were compared using two genotype sampling methods. In addition, the impact of training population (TP) size and marker density on prediction accuracy was explored. The study was done using a diversity panel (n = 298) that was genotyped using 90K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotyped for forage quality traits including crude protein, acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, sugars, lignin content, and in vitro true dry matter digestibility. Generally, the three models produced similar prediction accuracies, which ranged from 0.34 to 0.61, for all traits. The sampling method had little effect on accuracy. Crude protein was one of the traits with the highest prediction accuracy, and it required only 1000 markers to attain its highest prediction accuracy value. Increasing TP size and marker density increased accuracies of all traits, and increasing the TP size was more effective than increasing marker density. For this panel, the optimal TP size (nTP) was 150, at which point prediction accuracies of all traits, except for sugars, reached over 90% of the highest value at nTP = 250. However, the sampling method for marker density had no effect on accuracy. The results suggest that GS can be an alternative approach to facilitate selection of forage quality traits during forage wheat breeding. F. Maulana, J.D. Anderson, T.J. Butler, and X.-F.

Gene Selection using a High-Dimensional Regression Model with Microarrays in Cancer Prognostic Studies,"Mining of gene expression data to identify genes associated with patient survival is an ongoing problem in cancer prognostic studies using microarrays in order to use such genes to achieve more accurate prognoses. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) is often used for gene selection and parameter estimation in high-dimensional microarray data. The lasso shrinks some of the coefficients to zero, and the amount of shrinkage is determined by the tuning parameter, often determined by cross validation. The model determined by this cross validation contains many false positives whose coefficients are actually zero. We propose a method for estimating the false positive rate (FPR) for lasso estimates in a high-dimensional Cox model. We performed a simulation study to examine the precision of the FPR estimate by the proposed method. We applied the proposed method to real data and illustrated the identification of false positive genes.",2012,Cancer Informatics
Sparse fully convolutional network for face labeling,"Abstract This paper proposes a sparse fully convolutional network (FCN) for face labeling. FCN has demonstrated strong capabilities in learning representations for semantic segmentation. However, it often suffers from heavy redundancy in parameters and connections. To ease this problem, group Lasso regularization and intra-group Lasso regularization are utilized to sparsify the convolutional layers of the FCN. Based on this framework, parameters that correspond to the same output channel are grouped into one group, and these parameters are simultaneously zeroed out during training. For the parameters in groups that are not zeroed out, intra-group Lasso provides further regularization. The essence of the regularization framework lies in its ability to offer better feature selection and higher sparsity. Moreover, a fully connected conditional random fields (CRF) model is used to refine the output of the sparse FCN. The proposed approach is evaluated on the LFW face dataset with the state-of-the-art performance. Compared with a non-regularized FCN, the sparse FCN reduces the number of parameters by 91.55% while increasing the segmentation performance by 11% relative error reduction.",2019,Neurocomputing
Multimarker Proteomic Profiling for the Prediction of Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure,"Risk stratification of patients with systolic chronic heart failure (HF) is critical to better identify those who may benefit from invasive therapeutic strategies such as cardiac transplantation. Proteomics has been used to provide prognostic information in various diseases. Our aim was to investigate the potential value of plasma proteomic profiling for risk stratification in HF. A proteomic profiling using surface enhanced laser desorption ionization - time of flight - mass spectrometry was performed in a case/control discovery population of 198 patients with systolic HF (left ventricular ejection fraction <45%): 99 patients who died from cardiovascular cause within 3 years and 99 patients alive at 3 years. Proteomic scores predicting cardiovascular death were developed using 3 regression methods: support vector machine, sparse partial least square discriminant analysis, and lasso logistic regression. Forty two ion m/z peaks were differentially intense between cases and controls in the discovery population and were used to develop proteomic scores. In the validation population, score levels were higher in patients who subsequently died within 3 years. Similar areas under the curves (0.66 - 0.68) were observed for the 3 methods. After adjustment on confounders, proteomic scores remained significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality. Use of the proteomic scores allowed a significant improvement in discrimination of HF patients as determined by integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement indexes. In conclusion, proteomic analysis of plasma proteins may help to improve risk prediction in HF patients.",2015,PLoS ONE

Longitudinal tracking of physiological state with electromyographic signals.,"LONGITUDINAL TRACKING OF PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE WITH ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC SIGNALS Robert W. Stallard April 11, 2018 Electrophysiological measurements have been used in recent history to classify instantaneous physiological configurations, e.g., hand gestures. This work investigates the feasibility of working with changes in physiological configurations over time (i.e., longitudinally) using a variety of algorithms from the machine learning domain. We demonstrate a high degree of classification accuracy for a binary classification problem derived from electromyography measurements before and after a 35-day bedrest. The problem difficulty is increased with a more dynamic experiment testing for changes in astronaut sensorimotor performance by taking electromyography and force plate measurements before, during, and after a jump from a small platform. A LASSO regularization is performed to observe changes in relationship between electromyography features and force plate outcomes. SVM classifiers are employed to correctly identify the times at which these experiments are performed, which is important as these indicate a trajectory of adaptation.",2018,
[The growing endangerment of specialists in private practice--opening up access to hospital outpatient clinics from a legal point of view].,"There are two new rules of the German Health System Modernisation Act (GMG) affecting the activity of specialists in private practice: the authorization of a hospital according to Sect. 116 a (SGB V; Title Five of the Social Code) subsidiary to the registration of a SHI physicians and the authorization of a hospital-based physician. Negative effects on office-based physician in private practice will only occur if, for example, an ambulatory healthcare centre (MVZ) is being established by the hospital owner. Currently, Sect. 116 b SGB V also does not have any negative impact on office-based specialists. The benefits catalogue according to Sect. 116 b Para 3 SGB V has so far been narrowly defined. And, in the face of the diverging interests within the Joint Federal Committee Health Insurances/NationalAssociation of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians and Health Reform Consensus Act (GKG)--a noticeable broadening of this catalogue is not to be expected. Also, such a broadening of the scope of this catalogue will be counteracted by the fact that no legal right exists to the conclusion of a contract with the health insurance companies and that the health insurers will actually have to additionally reimburse for medical services according to the catalogue of Sect. 116b Para 3 SGB V beyond the total reimbursement budget.",2006,Zeitschrift fur arztliche Fortbildung und Qualitatssicherung
On the role of income in welfare evaluations with RUM,"There are two different econometric approaches used in thisthesis, random utility econometrics and spatialeconometrics. Random utility econometrics has become an increasinglyimportant tool in transportation, labour economics, housingeconomics, non-market valuation, resource and environmentaleconomics. In a discrete choice context the convenientapproach of using a fictious representative individual forwelfare assessment is inappropriate when the marginal utilityof money is not constant across alternatives. When marginalutility of money is not constant, it has been recognised thatthere have existed no exact methods to calculate hicksianwelfare measures. In the first essay of this thesis, an exactformula is derived which can be used for most real-worldapplications. In the second essay, the role of income in randomutility modelling is reviewed, and it is argued that theproblem has been obscured in the transportation economicsliterature as the choice settings implied have not always beenclearly defined. It is also shown that although Slutskysymmetry is not fulfilled, there exists a ``quasi-demand''function that can be integrated to establish path independenceof the hicksian welfare measures. Local indicators of spatial association have become animportant tool in spatial data analysis, but they are rarelyapplied to interaction flowdata. In the second essay a spatialassociation statistic for flow data is developed bygeneralizing the statistic of Getis-Ord, Gi(and Gi*) This local measure of spatial association, Gij, is associated with each origin destination pair.Measures which control for generation or attractionnonstationarity are also defined. The measures are implementedto examine the spatial association of residuals from twodifferent models. In contrast to the normal use of the Gistatistic, the normal approximation is oftenappropriate, but the statistics are still correlated. We alsodefine a test statistic for barrier effects, which is comparedwith the traditional dummy approach for barrier effects. Weargue that the explorative analysis of interaction flow dataadd to our understanding of the model. Spatial econometric methodology has been rarely applied toelectoral data. In the fourth essay we develop a game-theoretic model toinvestigate the political effect of spillovers in a localpublic choice context. It is shown that if there existstrategic interaction among jurisdictions, it may be beneficialto delegate power to a representative to set public spending.As a consequence, public spending levels may deviate in arepresentative and a direct democracy, without anymisrepresentation of preferences. This is in contrast a commonconclusion drawn from empirical investigations on local publicspending data. Spatial econometric methods are used in anexplorative analysis to find evidence of spatial effects inecological electoral data of split voting. The empiricalanalysis has its own value, since spatial data analysis methodshave rarely been applied to electoral data, and never toecological split voting data.",2010,
Cultivable Marine Bacterial Isolates from a Sponge Hyattella cribriformis,"Cultivable marine bacteria associated with the sponge Hyattella cribriformis (Hyatt, 1877) was studied through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These marine bacterial colonies produced on Zobell Marine agar plates were distinguished based on phenotypic characters viz., colony morphology and pigmentations of the individual colonies. The extracted DNA from the individual bacterial isolates was PCR amplified using universal 16S primers and subjected to DNA sequencing. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Tool) analysis finds that Vibrio diazotrophicus, Bacillus subtilis, B. firmus, Thalassomonas agarivorans, Oleiphilus messinensis, Planococcus maritimus and Brevundimonas vesicularis are the culturable marine bacteria associated with the sponge Hyattella cribriformis. The phylogram constructed clearly delineated the bacterial isolates into its corresponding phylum. The cultivable bacterial density of Hyattella cribriformis was found to be 65x10-5 CFU mL-1. Submitted sequences in NCBI were assigned with accession numbers (FJ834327, FJ834328, FJ834329, FJ845392, FJ845393, FJ845394 and FJ845395). It could be concluded that, application of 16S rRNA sequencing approach would yield novel insights into the diversity of bacteria associated with sponges and hence would help in exploring the commercial importance and their industrial applications.",2013,Journal of Biological Sciences

Fifty consecutive uniformly-treated adults with nonmetastatic high-grade sarcomas.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
1.5T; T2 -weighted-imaging, fat-suppressed fast spoiled gradient echo DCE-MRI.


ASSESSMENT
Ninety-two radiomics features (RFs) were extracted at each DCE-MRI phase (11, from t = 0-88 sec). Relative changes in RFs (rRFs) since the acquisition baseline were calculated (11â€‰Ã—â€‰92 rRFs). Curves of rRF as function of time postinjection were integrated (92 integrated-rRFs [irRFs]). Ktrans and area under the time-intensity curve at 88-sec parametric maps were computed and 2â€‰Ã—â€‰92 parametric-RFs (pRFs) were extracted. Five DCE-MRI-based radiomics models were built on: an RFs subset (32 sec, 64 sec, 88 sec); all rRFs; all irRFs; and all pRFs. Two models were elaborated as reference, on: conventional radiological features; and T2 -WI RFs.


STATISTICAL TESTS
A common machine-learning approach was applied to radiomics models. Features with P <â€‰0.05 at univariate analysis were entered in a LASSO-penalized Cox regression including bootstrapped 10-fold cross-validation. The resulting radiomics scores (RScores) were dichotomized per their median and entered in multivariate Cox models for predicting metastatic relapse-free survival. Models were compared with integrative area under the curve (AUC) and concordance index.


RESULTS
Only dichotomized RScores from models based on rRFs subset, all rRFS and irRFS correlated with prognostic (P = 0.0107-0.0377). The models including all rRFs and irRFs had the highest c-index (0.83), followed by the radiological model. The radiological model had the highest integrative AUC (0.87), followed by models including all rRFs and irRFs. The radiological and full rRFs models were significantly better than the T2 -based radiomics model (P = 0.02).


DATA CONCLUSION
The initial DCE-MRI of STS contains prognostic information. It seems more relevant to make predictions on rRFs instead of pRFs. Evidence Level: 3 Technical Efficacy: 3 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2020.",2020,Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI
Forecasting hotel reservations with long short-term memory-based recurrent neural networks,"Hotel reservations tie up a much large portion of a hotels annual revenue. It is of great benefit for hotel managers to accurately forecast the numbers of reservations each day so that they can make better operational and tactical decisions. In this study, we review three types of forecasting methods commonly used in practice and briefly illustrate the concepts of neural networks. We then propose two long short-term memory (LSTM) models based on recurrent neural networks. Actual reservations of four hotels in the USA are used to estimate and test the proposed two models. To measure the relative performance, six machine learning (ML) models of decision tree, multilayer perceptron, lasso, linear regression, random forest, and ridge are also estimated and tested against the same datasets. The empirical results show that, on average, the forecasting accuracy of using LSTM models has been improved about 3.0% over that of using the best of the ML models.",2018,International Journal of Data Science and Analytics
A Novel Method for Measuring Anterior Segment Area of the Eye on Ultrasound Biomicroscopic Images Using Photoshop,"PURPOSE
To describe a novel method for quantitative measurement of area parameters in ocular anterior segment ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) images using Photoshop software and to assess its intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility.


METHODS
Twenty healthy volunteers with wide angles and twenty patients with narrow or closed angles were consecutively recruited. UBM images were obtained and analyzed using Photoshop software by two physicians with different-level training on two occasions. Borders of anterior segment structures including cornea, iris, lens, and zonules in the UBM image were semi-automatically defined by the Magnetic Lasso Tool in the Photoshop software according to the pixel contrast and modified by the observers. Anterior chamber area (ACA), posterior chamber area (PCA), iris cross-section area (ICA) and angle recess area (ARA) were drawn and measured. The intraobserver and interobserver reproducibilities of the anterior segment area parameters and scleral spur location were assessed by limits of agreement, coefficient of variation (CV), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).


RESULTS
All of the parameters were successfully measured by Photoshop. The intraobserver and interobserver reproducibilities of ACA, PCA, and ICA were good, with no more than 5% CV and more than 0.95 ICC, while the CVs of ARA were within 20%. The intraobserver and interobserver reproducibilities for defining the spur location were more than 0.97 ICCs. Although the operating times for both observers were less than 3 minutes per image, there was significant difference in the measuring time between two observers with different levels of training (p<0.001).


CONCLUSION
Measurements of ocular anterior segment areas on UBM images by Photoshop showed good intraobserver and interobserver reproducibilties. The methodology was easy to adopt and effective in measuring.",2015,PLoS ONE
Late Aptian (Early Cretaceous) dryâ€“wet cycles and their effects on vegetation in the South Atlantic: Palynological evidence,"Abstract The Cretaceous is generally conceived as one of the warmest geological periods in Earth history. The link between climate and plant distribution is here highlighted on the basis of palynological analyses. An upper Aptian well section from the Sergipe Basin in northeastern Brazil documents four cycles of dryâ€“wet oscillations, based on palynological evidence. The cycles show a general trend of acceleration of the hydrological cycle. Dry periods are recorded mainly at the base of the section, with changes to more humid periods upwards. The dry periods are characterized by high to very high abundance of Classopollis classoides pollen grains. Already in the wet periods a conspicuous change in vegetation is recorded, with an increase in fern spores and upland flora, in particular Araucariacites australis pollen grains. The replacement of Classopollis by Araucariacites and ferns reflects a change from dry to wet conditions. The first dryâ€“wet cycle (DWC-1) is recorded in the dominantly non-marine phase. At the base of this first cycle, intensive growth of anhydrite nodules is recorded. However, in beds overlying the evaporites, there is a conspicuous increase in flora associated with humid conditions (ferns and upland flora). DWC-2 starts with a pronounced peak of dinoflagellate cysts, which decrease abruptly accompanied by an increase in xerophytic flora (e.g., Classopollis classoides, Equisetosporites spp.). The abundance of xerophytic flora decreases upwards to give room for high abundances of fern spores, upland flora (e.g., Araucariacites australis, Cicatricosisporites spp.) and, in particular, dinoflagellate cysts. DWC-3 starts with a short interval containing a moderate abundance of xerophytes and a conspicuous wet flora and marine elements. With rising humidity, fern spore diversity also increased, suggesting that humidity was an important factor for the increase in diversity of this group. DWC-4 records minor peaks of xerophytic flora and a dominance of fern spores and upland flora. The progressive change in flora may be the result of displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and a relative sea-level rise.",2019,Cretaceous Research
Outlier Detection using Generative Models with Theoretical Performance Guarantees,"This paper considers the problem of recovering signals from compressed measurements contaminated with sparse outliers, which has arisen in many applications. In this paper, we propose a generative model neural network approach for reconstructing the ground truth signals under sparse outliers. We propose an iterative alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for solving the outlier detection problem via $\ell_1$ norm minimization, and a gradient descent algorithm for solving the outlier detection problem via squared $\ell_1$ norm minimization. We establish the recovery guarantees for reconstruction of signals using generative models in the presence of outliers, and give an upper bound on the number of outliers allowed for recovery. Our results are applicable to both the linear generator neural network and the nonlinear generator neural network with an arbitrary number of layers. We conduct extensive experiments using variational auto-encoder and deep convolutional generative adversarial networks, and the experimental results show that the signals can be successfully reconstructed under outliers using our approach. Our approach outperforms the traditional Lasso and $\ell_2$ minimization approach.",2018,ArXiv
THE EFFECT OF THE EL N ~ o-- SOUTHERN OSCILLATION EVENT ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF REEF-ASSOCIATED LABRID FISHES IN THE EASTERN PACIFIC OCEAN,"We surveyed the labrid fishes of the eastern Pacific ocean at multiple sites before, during, and after the 1997-98 ENS0 event. Our observations showed that reef fish communities in general did not appear to change markedly as a result of the ENSO. Recruitment of labrids at the Galapagos Islands, Clipperton Atoll and Baja California was generally high near the end of the ENSO, indicating no negative effect on populations. Two labrid species did extend their known range during the ENSO: Stethojdis banclanensis settled onto the tip of Baja California and to the Galipagos Islands, while Thalassoma virens recruited heavily to sites along the southern Sea of Cortez in Baja California. We discuss the oceanographic conditions during the ENS0 that may have promoted the range extensions. Adults of these species were present in Baja California and Galipagos 2 yrs after the end of the ENSO. Our observations raise the question why these species do not colonize these sites in normal years, given the potential for long larval durations (up to a maximum of 104 d in i? virens) and rapid long-distance transport between islands in the region (recruits of S. banclanensis spent only about 32 d in the plankton). The recent El Niiio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event of 1997-98 is considered to be one of the most intense of the past few centuries and has had a profound effect on the marine environment of the eastern Pacific Ocean (Glynn et al., this issue). The most significant and lasting result has been widespread mortality of reef-building corals throughout the region. The effect on reef-associated fishes is less dramatic and less well-documented, yet may be important to explaining the biogeography of fishes in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The epicenter of the temperature anomalies during the ENS0 is near the Galapagos Islands, where the normal cool annual upwelling cycle disappears, the thermocline deepens, and a vast region of exceptionally warm surface water develops and persists for many months (reviewed in Enfield, this issue). In addition, the eastward flowing North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) speeds up considerably, and warm tropical water builds up in the eastern Pacific and flows towards more temperate regions (Wyrtki, 1985; Lea and Rosenblatt, 2000). The eastern Pacific region is particularly well-suited to an analysis of how oceanographic anomalies such as the ENS0 affect reef fish biogeography. The distribution of habitats is simple: a long north-south stretch of thin continental shelf with several isolated island groups at varying distances from the coast (Fig. 1). There are marked temperature variations, both seasonal and latitudinal, distinct regions of upwelling, and clearly delineated areas of rocky coastline, coral reefs, and soft sediment (Glynn and Ault, 2000). Furthermore, the whole region is separated from the complex biogeographical regions of the central and western Pacific by a vast ocean expanse, the East Pacific Barrier, over 5000 km without island stepping stones (Leis, 1984; Grigg and Hey, 1992). As a result, the vast majority of reef fish species in the area are endemic to the eastern Pacific an4 furthermore, exhibit a great variety of patterns of distribution within the region (Briggs, 1974; Allen and Robertson, 1994; Victor and Wellington, 2000). 280 BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL. 69, NO. I , 2001 The effects of unanticipated events such as the ENS0 are difficult to study due to the lack of appropriate pre-event data. There have been some reports during and after prior ENS0 events focusing on specific localities (e.g., Grove, 1984 for Galipagos ) or particular species (e.g., Wellington and Victor, 1985 for a Panamanian damselfish), however, no broad-scale regional studies have been made. We were fortunate to have surveyed populations of labrid fishes at multiple sites within the eastern Pacific Ocean in the years preceding, during, and after the 1997-98 ENSO. Our surveys included the extreme limits of the warm tropical fauna at the tip of the Baja California peninsula in the north and the Galipagos Islands in the south as well as the offshore islands of Clipperton Atoll and Cocos. The Galipagos Archipelago is notable for containing an often abrupt transition from a tropical warm water fauna in the central and northern islands to a cool Peruvian province fauna in the western and southern islands (Rosenblatt and Walker, 1963; McCosker and Rosenblatt, 1984). Although much of the data presented here is qualitative and some is anecdotal, an overview of the effect of the 1997-98 ENS0 on labrid and some other reef fishes can be assembled from our observations. We surveyed the labrid fauna at multiple sites in the tropical eastern Pacific before, during, and after the 1997-98 ENS0 event (see details in Wellington and Victor, 1992; Robertson and Allen, 1996; Victor and Wellington, 2000). Methods of survey, collecting effort, ocean conditions, and personnel involved differed substantially between sites and dates, precluding a globally rigorous quantitative assessment of the regional effect of the ENSO. Two sets of data were collected consistently: quantitative collections of tidepool recruits in Baja California and qualitative estimates of abundances in the Galapagos (discussed below). Other data included species lists from various sites, general observations by local fish biologists, periodic quantitative fish counts, collections of labrid juveniles for other studies, and full-scale ichthyocide collections. Collections and surveys were made by various authors at Clipperton Atoll in April 1994 and May 1998,'Cocos Island in November 1990 and November 1997, the Revillagigedo Archipelago in June 1990, Galapagos Islands in April 1990, January 1995, May-August 1998, and June-August 2000 and the tip of Baja California in October 1989, January 1997, February, March, May and September 1998, July 1999, April, July, and August 2000 (Fig. 1). In conjunction with a study on the pelagic larval duration and the biogeography of eastern Pacific labrid and pomacentrid fishes (Victor et al., 2000), we examined the otoliths of some of the fishes we collected. We were interested in examining individuals that settled during the E N S 0 and belonged to species that were not resident in the area prior to the ENSO. These individuals could therefore represent long distance migrants delivered by ENSO-induced currents (i.e., Stethojulis bandanensis to Galapagos and Baja California and Thalassoma virens to Baja California). The otoliths of these fishes were processed and the daily increments counted as described in Victor (1 99 1). We determined the pelagic larval duration for 10 individuals of S. banclanensis settling in the Galapagos Islands and 10 7: virens and seven S. banclanensis settling in Baja California. We did few quantitative surveys, but in Baja California we collected labrids in a set of tidepools just south of Punta Pescadero on the east Cape of the tip of the Baja Peninsula, south of La Paz (Fig. 1). This site consisted of an area of about 100 m2 of shallow tidepools and on our visits to Baja California we collected all of the juvenile labrids present in the pools at low tide (typically only Thalassoma spp.). Seven collections were made between January 1997 and August 2000 (Fig. 2). In the Galapagos Islands we did a more qualitative survey of the labrids. The abundance of each labrid species was recorded for each dive at each location in 1990, 1995, and 1998. On each expedition, we visited Santa Cruz, Santiago, Isabela, Fernandina, and Genovesa and included Marchena in 1990 and 1995, Floreana in 1995 and Wolf in 1998. The surveys are comparable because about 20 dives were made on each trip, most of the dive sites were the same (commonly visited locations), VICTOR ET AL.: EL NIRO AND REEF-ASSOCIATED LABRID FISHES IN THETASTERN PACIFIC 281",2004,
Subscapularis avulsion of the lesser tuberosity in adolescents.,"BACKGROUND
Lesser tuberosity avulsion fractures in adolescents occur infrequently. Perhaps because of their rarity, many cases are missed on initial physical exam, imaging studies, and even diagnostic arthroscopy, leading to delay in diagnosis. Without operative intervention, these injuries may cause significant morbidity, whereas operative fixation has predictably good results. We review 6 cases and compare them to a review of the previous published cases.


METHODS
All cases of isolated lesser tuberosity avulsions in skeletally immature patients treated by the senior author (MTB) at a pediatric referral center were included. The mean follow-up was over 4 years (range, 2 to 7 y). Operative treatment consisted of a diagnostic arthroscopy to evaluate for concomitant pathology, followed by an open reattachment of the tuberosity through an incision in line with the anterior axillary fold. A lasso technique using suture anchors and sutures to loop over and hold down the fragment is our preferred method as it decreases the risk of fracture seen with fixation using screws or sutures through drill holes in the tuberosity.


RESULTS
Even with a frequent delay in diagnosis, all patients had a predictably good outcome with an average American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score of 97 (range, 88 to 100) and a Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index of 94 (range, 84 to 100). The patient history, symptoms, and physical exam findings were consistent across the published cases. The prototypical patient is a male, age 13, who sustains an abduction and extension injury during sports. Anterior shoulder pain, positive belly press, and lift-off signs are frequent findings.


CONCLUSIONS
A high index of suspicion is needed to recognize this uncommon injury. History, physical exam for subscapularis function, and magnetic resonance imaging should be diagnostic. Operative treatment with a suture anchor lasso technique leads to predictably good results.

Persistent photoconductivity and the metal-insulator transition in Cd(_1-x)Mn(_x)Te:In,"The persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effect in the diluted magnetic semiconductor Cd(_1-x)Mn(_x)Te:In has been studied in detail. Electrical transport measurements have been made on a large number of samples to build up an understanding of the phototransport properties of this material. In particular, the compositional dependence of the phototransport parameters has been measured up to x â‰ˆ 0.2. Several samples exhibit an elevated temperature PPC effect which has been interpreted in terms of the formation of multiple DX centres. These samples can have a quenching temperature of up to 190 K, suggestmg that Cd(_1-x)Mn(_x)Te:In could be an interesting material in terms of applications of room temperature persistent photoconductors. The low field magnetoresistance has been measured and analysed quantitatively in order to attempt to identify the origin of the magnetoresistive effects in insulating and metallic samples. The positive magnetoresistance has been found to be linked with the magnetization of the sample. An anomalous negative magnetoresistance has been observed tinder certain experimental conditions. This negative magnetoresistance has been interpreted in terms of the formation of bound magnetic polarons and their contribution to spin-disorder scattering. The main body of this thesis is concerned with the study of the Metal-Insulator Transition (MIT). The PPC effect allows us to study the MIT in a continuous fashion by fine timing the carrier density by illumuiation. In this way we have made the first zero magnetic field study of the MIT in a magnetic semiconductor. The critical behaviour has been found to be consistent with the scaling theory of electron localization, which predicts a critical form Ïƒ = Ïƒ(_0)(n/n(_c) â€“ 1)(^v). The critical conductivity exponent, v was determined to be close to one, while the critical carrier density, n(_e), was found to be ~ 2 x 10(^17) cm(^-3), for x = 0.08. The temperature dependence of the conductivity has been quantitatively analysed m both the metallic and insulating phases. On the insulating side of the transition, variable range hopping (VRH) conduction has been observed at low temperatures (down to 300 mK). The temperature dependence is consistent with VRH conduction with electron-electron interaction effects taken into account. In the metallic phase the temperature dependence of the conductivity (up to ~ 1 K) is consistent with a model where the zero temperature value of the conductivity is corrected by electron-electroninteraction effects, and the effects of weak localization. The magnitudes of these corrections are found to be in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions. The electrical transport has also been studied in the weakly localized regime in Cd(_1-x)Mn(_x)Te:In and Cd(_1-x)Mn(_x)Te:In, Al. A rapid decrease in the conductivity occurs at low temperatures ( < 1.5 K). This is interpreted in terms of the effect of the s-d exchange interaction, which leads to the formation of bound magnetic polarons. It is suggested that this drop in conductivity can only be observed in the paramagnetic phase, and that spinglassordering has a significant effect on the temperature dependence of the conductivity at low temperatures.",1997,
Endosialin-Expressing Pericytes Promote,"Metastasis is a multistep process that is critically dependent on the interaction of metastasizing tumor cells with cells in the local microenvironment. Within this tumor stroma, vesselassociated pericytes and myofibroblasts share a number of traits, including the upregulated expression of the transmembrane receptor endosialin (CD248). Comparative experiments in wild-type and endosialin-deficient mice revealed that stromal endosialin does not affect primary tumor growth but strongly promotes spontaneous metastasis. Mechanistically, endosialin-expressing pericytes in the primary tumor facilitate distant site metastasis by promoting tumor cell intravasation in a cell contactâ€“dependent manner, resulting in elevated numbers of circulating tumor cells. Corresponding to these preclinical experiments, in independent cohorts of primary human breast cancers, upregulated endosialin expression significantly correlates with increased metastasis and poorer patient survival. Together, the data demonstrate a critical role for endosialin-expressing primary tumor pericytes in mediating metastatic dissemination and identify endosialin as a promising therapeutic target in breast cancer.

HIV-1 superinfections in a cohort of commercial sex workers in Burkina Faso as assessed by an autologous heteroduplex mobility procedure.,"OBJECTIVE
To describe and evaluate a simple procedure to identify HIV-1 co- or super-infections based on a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA).


METHODS
To identify heteroduplexes corresponding to divergent viral populations in a the same individual, HMA was applied to single DNA samples from each subject in a prospective cohort of commercial sex workers (CSW) in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. After denaturation and renaturation of env DNA amplicons, hybridized DNA was separated by electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gel. HIV-1 co-infections were suspected by slow migration of heteroduplex, at a level comparable to that of mixed reference strains. Following electrophoresis, DNA in bands representing heteroduplex was extracted and cloned in a plasmid vector; identification of phylogenetically distinct clones was confirmed by sequencing divergent clones identified through a second HMA step of a pair of two mixed clones.


RESULTS
Among 147 HIV-1 infected CSW, four had an autologous HMA profile comparable to low mobility of hybridized DNA from mixed reference strains representing most frequent HIV-1 clades and circulating recombinant forms (CRF) prevalent in Burkina Faso. In two of them, two phylogenetically distinct HIV-1 populations were coexisting. The first woman presented with a CRF02-AG and CRF06-cpx co-infection, and the second with a CRF02-AG and a divergent virus co-infection not significantly related to any other known subtypes. In both women, retrospective analyses of stored samples by the same HMA procedure showed acquisition of a second virus concomitent with an increasing plasma HIV RNA.


CONCLUSIONS
Autologous HMA procedure followed by acrylamide extraction of heteroduplexes allowed identifying HIV-1 co- and super-infections in a large cohort study. HIV-1 super-infection is not an uncommon phenomenon.",2004,AIDS
Increasing stability and interpretability of gene expression signatures,"Motivation : Molecular signatures for diagnosis or prognosis estimated from large-scale gene expression data often lack robustness and stability, rendering their biological interpretation challenging. Increasing the signature's interpretability and stability across perturbations of a given dataset and, if possible, across datasets, is urgently needed to ease the discovery of important biological processes and, eventually, new drug targets. Results : We propose a new method to construct signatures with increased stability and easier interpretability. The method uses a gene network as side interpretation and enforces a large connectivity among the genes in the signature, leading to signatures typically made of genes clustered in a few subnetworks. It combines the recently proposed graph Lasso procedure with a stability selection procedure. We evaluate its relevance for the estimation of a prognostic signature in breast cancer, and highlight in particular the increase in interpretability and stability of the signature.",2010,arXiv: Machine Learning
"Palynofacies and palaeoenvironmental significance of the Albian â€“ Cenomanian succession of the Epunsa-1 well, onshore Tano Basin, western Ghana","Abstract Palynofacies analysis carried out on thirty-three (33) cutting samples between the intervals 2990â€“5960Â ft from the Epunsa-1 well onshore Tano Basin, identified three palynofacies types (P-1 to P-3). Palynofacies 1 (P-1) reflects deposition in shallow marine environment adjacent to active fluvial sources under a mud-dominated oxic (distal shelf) condition, Palynofacies 2 (P-2) was deposited in a shallow marine to fluvio-deltaic environment under a heterolithic oxic shelf condition and Palynofacies 3 (P-3) was deposited in a fluvio-deltaic environment in proximity to the source of vegetation under a dysoxic shelf condition. Visual kerogen analysis and spore colour for evaluation of hydrocarbon potential and thermal maturation respectively indicate early mature oil/gas prone to immature gas prone source rocks in the studied interval in the Epunsa-1 well. The presence of Afropollis, Classopollis , Ephedripites , and elaterate pollen as well as pteridophytic fern spores suggest a paleoenvironment with parent plants inhabiting moist biotopes or wetlands in a humid and warm coastal plain in a semi-arid/arid climate.

Suppression of IL-1.ALPHA. production by PKC activators in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.,"In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -Î± stimulated the production of cellassociated interleukin (IL) -1Î±. Combined treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with TNF-Î± and the protein kinase C (PKC) activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) suppressed the TNF-Î±-induced IL-1Î± production. However, concentrations of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1Î± in the conditioned medium were increased to a greater extent by combined treatment with TNF-Î± and TPA than by single treatment with TNF-Î± or TPA. Pretreatment with TPA for 15 min was enough to suppress the TNF-Î±-induced IL-1Î± production. Pretreatment for 15 min with other PKC activators such as aplysiatoxin (AT) or teleocidin (TC), also inhibited the TNF-Î±-induced IL-1Î± production. Stimulation of cell-associated IL-1Î± production by IL-1Î² or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was also inhibited by treatment with the PKC activator TPA, AT or TC. However, treatment with the protein kinase inhibitor H-7 did not block the inhibitory effect of TPA, AT or TC on the cellassociated IL-1Î± production stimulated by TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² or LPS, although the PKC activator induced stimulation of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1Î± production was counteracted by H-7 treatment. These findings indicate that the production of cell-associated IL-1Î± stimulat-ed by TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² or LPS is inhibited by these PKC activators, but the inhibition by such PKC activators of IL-1Î± production is not due to PKC-dependent mechanism.To further confirm this notion, effects of these drugs on IL-1 production by other cells were examined. In human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, these PKC activators inhibited cell-associated IL-1Î± production stimulated by TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² or LPS, and this inhibitory effect was not counteracted by the PKC inhibitor H-7 or staurosporine. In contrast, in human epithelial cell line NCI-H292, these PKC activators further enhanced LPS-induced IL-1Î± production. In addition, IL-1Î² production by human dermal fibroblasts and human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 stimulated by LPS or TNF-Î± was enhanced by these PKC activators. These results suggest that the suppression of IL-1Î± production by these PKC activators is a specific event to vascular endothelial cells.",1996,
Penalized Partial Least Square applied to structured data,"Nowadays, data analysis applied to high dimension has arisen. The edification of high-dimensional data can be achieved by the gathering of different independent data. However, each independent set can introduce its own bias. We can cope with this bias introducing the observation set structure into our model. The goal of this article is to build theoretical background for the dimension reduction method sparse Partial Least Square (sPLS) in the context of data presenting such an observation set structure. The innovation consists in building different sPLS models and linking them through a common-Lasso penalization. This theory could be applied to any field, where observation present this kind of structure and, therefore, improve the sPLS in domains, where it is competitive. Furthermore, it can be extended to the particular case, where variables can be gathered in given a priori groups, where sPLS is defined as a sparse group Partial Least Square.",2019,Arabian Journal of Mathematics

Linear Trend Filtering via Adaptive LASSO,"Linear trend filtering methods are popular due to their overall simplicityâ€”the model is linear in each segment and there are typically only few segments considered. These segments are defined by unique points where the trend changes its directionâ€”so-called changepoints. In this paper, we consider an innovative estimation approach for such models. Our proposal is based on recent developments in the atomic pursuit techniques: we present an estimation algorithm based on the adaptive LASSO penalty and we introduce a fully data-driven method which can be effectively used to fit the continuous linear trend models. Some statistical properties are discussed and the empirical performance is compared with respect to other competitive LASSO-based techniques.",2017,
Prevalence and Factors Associated with Alcohol Consumption in Urban Schools in Burkina Faso,"Background: In 2005, the World Health Assembly asked member states to develop effective strategies and programs to reduce the negative consequences of harmful use of alcohol. To develop effective policies, we must already understand the phenomenon of alcohol consumption. But in Francophone west Africa, there are very few studies on the prevalence of alcohol, consumption patterns and factors associated with this consumption. The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of alcohol use in schools in Burkina Faso and to identify socio-demographic factors associated with episodes of â€œheavy drinkingâ€. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2013 in six secondary schools of Bobo-Dioulasso. Three hundred and sixty-two students randomly drawn by stratified cluster sampling were interviewed by using a self-administered questionnaire adapted from the model ESPAD and WHO AUDIT questionnaire. HED (Heavy Episodic Drinking) was defined as consuming at least six local measures of alcoholic beverages around the 30 days prior investigation. The search for factors was performed using logistic regression and estimating standard errors were adjusted for clustering data. Results: The prevalence of experimentation of alcohol was estimated to 45.6% [CI 95% = 40.4 - 50.7]. This prevalence was reduced to 34.8% [CI 95% = 29.9 - 39.7], 24.3% [CI 95% = 19.9 - 28.7] and 18% [CI 95% = 14 - 21.9] if one considered the use of alcohol at least once respectively in the 12 months, 30 days and 7 days before the survey. The prevalence of HED was 16% [CI95% = 12.2 - 19.8]. Independent factors associated with the HED were alcohol use by parents or friends and fatherâ€™s occupation. Episodes of â€œheavy drinkingâ€ were 8.3 (CI 95% = 4.9 - 14) and 2.8 (CI 95% = 1.3 - 5.8) respectively more frequent among students whose parents and friends were drinking. Neither religion nor sex nor age was not statistically associated with HED. Conclusion: This study confirms the high prevalence of alcohol consumption in schools in Burkina Faso and challenges policy makers to adopt effective policies to fight against the harmful use of alcohol especially in schools.",2017,Open Journal of Gastroenterology
Adaptive efficient sparse estimator achieving oracle properties,"Compressed Sensing is the new trend in the signal processing context which aims to sample a compressible signal with a rate less than the Nyquist lower bound sampling rate. The main challenge arises due to the non-convex optimisation problem to be solved in the reconstruction stage. This paper introduces a suitable objective function in order to simultaneously recover the true support of the underlying sparse signal while achieving an acceptable estimation error. Inspired by the well-known Lasso objective function, we have developed an objective function based on a new penalty denoted by the Linearised Exponentially Decaying (LED) penalty. The comprehensive analysis of the LED based objective function shows that the new approach satisfies the oracle properties, as opposed to the conventional Lasso objective function. Furthermore, we have developed a Sequential Adaptive Coordinate-wise (SAC) solution for the proposed objective function. The simulation results for the proposed LED-SAC reconstruction algorithm are given and compared with other state of the art methods. It is shown that LED-SAC approaches the least mean squared error criterion. Moreover, compared to the other methods, LED-SAC has much more adaptation rate in terms of tracking the variations in the support of the underlying sparse signal.",2013,IET Signal Processing
The PIND study found no association between vaccination and autism in mitochondrial disease - correction.,"We noted that in two children with progressive intellectualand neurological deterioration there was a reported temporalassociation between immunization and the onset of clinicalsymptoms attributed to mitochondrial disease. In one casethese symptoms commenced in the same week as administra-tion of triple vaccine (diphtheriaâ„pertussisâ„tetanus);* in theother case symptoms occurred 2 weeks after MMR vaccina-tion in a child with a Norwalk virus infection.In three other children with mitochondrial disease causingPIND there were reports of autistic features. In none of thesethree cases was there any mention of deterioration in associa-tion with a vaccination.The PIND study questionnaire asked about presentingsymptoms and the subsequent clinical course of childrenreported to the study, which is how we obtained the relevantclinical information. However, the questionnaire did notspeciï¬cally ask about an association between vaccination andthe onset of clinical symptoms, nor did it ask about autism, soour conclusions about these data have to be guarded.In the same issue of DMCN there was an excellent com-mentary on our paper by Mark Sharrard.",2011,Developmental medicine and child neurology
"Palynostratigraphy of Cretaceous Sediments from Site 387, Western Bermuda Rise","Twenty-five samples, representing a section approximately 303 meters thick, were studied from Site 387 in the western North Atlantic in order to determine the stratigraphic distribution of sporomorphs and dinoflagellate cysts. Eight dinoflagellate zones and four sporomorph zones (two subzones) were distinguished which permit the dating of the section by correlation with the zonations established for the reference section at Site 105. Palynomorphs date the section of Site 387 as ranging from Berriasian/ lower Valanginian (stratigraphic level of Core 49) to Cenomanian (Core 30). The palynofacies of the Cretaceous section at Site 387 is the same as that for other previously investigated sites in the western North Atlantic. Neocomian palynomorph assemblages are domiÂ¬ nated by dinoflagellate species of Druggidium and Biorbifera (B. johnewingii) and by sporomorph taxa represented by bisaccate pollen, relatively smooth and small pteriodophyte spores, and Classopollis torosus. Middle Cretaceous assemblages reflect the stratigraphic (and evolutionary) succession of angiosperm pollen species with respect to both species diversity and abundance of specimens. Dinoflagellates are less abundant as a palynomorph group and are represented to a large extent by cavate cysts with a peridinioid outline.",1979,
Lymphotoxin-Î± gene 252G allelic variant is a risk factor for large-vessel-associated ischemic stroke,"A direct role of lymphotoxin-Î± (LTA) in promoting atherosclerotic plaque growth has been demonstrated recently. The different protein transcripts of the naturally occurring genetic variants of the LTA gene have been demonstrated to exhibit affected functions, and an allelic difference in binding to transcription factor(s) has also been suggested. The homozygous variant of LTA characterized by the intron 1 252Aâ†’G (252G) transition, which naturally coexists with an exon 3 804Câ†’A (804A) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), has been reported as a susceptibility gene for myocardial infarction. Because the atherosclerotic process is also an integral component in the pathogenesis of certain types of vascular stroke, we investigated the possible significance of the above SNPs in 353 ischemic stroke patients and 180 healthy controls. The homozygous LTA allele with the 252G and 804C SNPs occurred more frequently in stroke patients (13.9%) than in controls (7.20%, p<0.025). Specific subclassification of the patients revealed an accumulation of these SNPs in large-vessel, pathology-associated cerebral infarction (18.2%); multivariate logistic regression analysis of the data confirmed this association, with an odds ratio of 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.3â€“6.2; p<0.005). Elimination of all subjects with a history or evidence of ischemic heart disease, including myocardial infarction, did not affect this association. These data show that besides the role in the development of myocardial infarction, the homozygous carriage of the LTA allele with 252G and 804A SNPs is a novel susceptibility factor for largevesselassociated ischemic stroke.",2007,Journal of Molecular Neuroscience
Gene Expression Profile Alone Is Inadequate In Predicting Complete Responses In Multiple Myeloma,"Abstract 306 Current therapy for multiple myeloma (MM) remains empiric. With advancement in the understanding of its molecular basis, newer therapies are emerging faster than ever with increasing the difficulty in the selection of treatment regime to maximize response and minimize the rising cost of therapy. In recent years, treatment response prediction using gene expression profiling is being evaluated to identify expression signature that can classify patients likely to benefit from chemotherapy, e.g., there are several multi-gene expression assays available to predict treatment responses. However, expression signatures and predictive power vary significantly among these assays. Here, we have assessed the ability of gene expression profile to predict complete response (CR) in patients with MM. We evaluated 128 newly-diagnosed patients with MM enrolled on IFM protocol and treated uniformly with high-dose melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplant. Seventy one of 128 patients (56%) had achieved CR while the rest 57 (44%) had partial response (PR) or less to this therapeutic intervention. CD138+ MM cells collected at the time of diagnosis were profiled for gene expression and processed using the dChip and aroma.affymetrix module in R software. We have used all common machine learning packages in R/Bioconductor and BRB-array Tools software to build response signature models; the packages used but not limited to were: Decision tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Prediction Analysis of Microarray (PAM), K-Nearest Neighbors, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), Lasso, Ridge regression, amongst others. For accurate assessment of model prediction ability, the dataset was split into training and test sets. Classifier gene models were built, trained and evaluated using K-fold cross-validation followed by model selection based on minimum prediction error. We built several models using different classification methods and experimented with gene inclusion criteria in our datasets according to those features most differentially expressed between CR and non-CR patients. Final model from each of these methods was applied to test dataset to predict CR vs non-CR, and prediction results were evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a predictive measure. The maximum AUC among all the training-testing splits was 0.63. The true positive rate (Sensitivity) to correctly predict CR case reached maximum 70% or more at the cost of higher false negative, which is to misclassify a patient as non-CR who might have responded to the treatment. Among the number of methods employed, our best predictive capability provided 66% sensitivity, 60% specificity, 67% positive predictive value and 59% negative predictive value. Importantly, comparing real CR proportion (71/128 = 56%) with that of predicted by the best model (66%), no statistically significant difference was observed (Chi-square; p-value: 0.09). We observe similar results using two independent datasets available in public data repository. Based on our analysis, we recognize and in fact foresee that the expression profile alone has limited ability to predict treatment response especially when response rate is high. This lack of predictability using current approach of response prediction with gene expression alone may be related to several limitations, like alternate splicing, miRNA-based gene regulation, post-translational modifications, binary distribution of response status, inherent variability of new samples, and developing unified signature without consideration of myeloma subtypes. A comprehensive model needs to be developed using global genomic changes to have meaningful output for clinical application.

UK Estimates of Burden of Disease Associated with Management of Intermediate-2 or High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes,"Abstract 4749 BACKGROUND: Previous UK studies into the burden of disease (BoD) of intermediate-2 (INT-2) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have focused on the potential budget impact of azacitidine. No estimates have been published for the UK that incorporate the costs associated with basic disease management in the UK for this group of patients. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the annual burden of MDS in the UK. METHODS: The research comprised a systematic review of studies in haematological cancer, and a subsequent economic analysis. The systematic review extracted all relevant BoD information from identified papers, including not only patient or healthcare elements, but also the burden on carers and family. The economic analysis combined all available, relevant evidence into annual, UK-specific cost estimates. RESULTS: The systematic literature review identified and extracted information from 23 papers. Study designs were comprised of economic evaluations (n=6), observational studies (n=2), RCTs (n=2), retrospective analyses involving registries or hospital data (n=6), review articles (n=3) and surveys (n=4). The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence appraisal of azacitidine was also included as was information from the pivotal trial of azacitidine, AZA-001. Across the literature reviewed, three main types of standard care were identified: supportive care (SC) alone, low-dose chemotherapy (LDC) and, more rarely, standard dose chemotherapy (SDC). Many papers provided estimates of transfusion burden, which had the largest BoD impact in patients who were considered transfusion dependent. Use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents was identified as an additional important resource, and the societal burden of haematological cancer was also quantified in one study, which examined time required of carers and family for transfusion visits. The most recent UK epidemiological estimates were used to convert average per-patient BoD figures to national estimates. Each type of standard care had a different associated burden of blood transfusions; therefore, the subsequent economic analysis weighted the estimated BoD according to the proportion of patients expected to be eligible for BSC, LDC and SDC. It is expected that 761 INT-2 and high-risk MDS patients will be treated each year. Among these, it was estimated that a total 5,121 blood transfusions would be required per year. These transfusions are expected to be associated with a total UK annual cost of approximately Â£1.4 million to the NHS, as well as Â£17,955 to carers and family members based on expected time off work to attend transfusion sessions with the patient. Values ranging between Â£10 million and Â£14 million per year were estimated for the likely national BoD on hospitals for inpatient stays, and the national cost of NHS community nurse visits was estimated to be Â£115,877 per year. The societal cost of inpatient stays was also experimentally calculated based on hospitalisation statistics from the AZA-001 trial; this produced an estimated annual burden of Â£312,010 for the UK. CONCLUSION: The annual burden of disease associated with MDS in the UK is estimated at between Â£12 million and Â£16 million. Major components of this burden include hospitalisation and transfusion costs. Indirect costs associated with MDS such as productivity costs for patients and carers appear relatively modest but are nonetheless an important consideration and should not be overlooked.

Local Adaptive Grouped Regularization and its Oracle Properties for Varying Coefficient Regression,"Varying coefficient regression is a flexible technique for modeling data where the coefficients are functions of some effect-modifying parameter, often time or location in a certain domain. While there are a number of methods for variable selection in a varying coefficient regression model, the existing methods are mostly for global selection, which includes or excludes each covariate over the entire domain. Presented here is a new local adaptive grouped regularization (LAGR) method for local variable selection in spatially varying coefficient linear and generalized linear regression. LAGR selects the covariates that are associated with the response at any point in space, and simultaneously estimates the coefficients of those covariates by tailoring the adaptive group Lasso toward a local regression model with locally linear coefficient estimates. Oracle properties of the proposed method are established under local linear regression and local generalized linear regression. The finite sample properties of LAGR are assessed in a simulation study and for illustration, the Boston housing price data set is analyzed.",2014,arXiv: Methodology
Defensive chemicals of the Spanisch dancer nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus and its egg ribbons: macrolides derived from a sponge diet,"Abstract The Spanish dancer nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus (Ruppell et Leuckart), a large brightly colored shell-less sea slug (Gastropoda : Opisthobranchia) common to Indo-Pacific coral reefs, derives a potent chemical defense from a sponge that it eats ( Halichondria sp.). In turn, the nudibranch passes defensive compounds to its egg ribbons, which are similarly conspicuous and physically defenseless. Slices of the dorsal mantle tissue of the nudibranch were rejected in laboratory feeding assays employing two common sympatric predators: an Indo-Pacific reef fish, Thalassoma lunare (Linnaeus), and a reef hermit crab, Dardanus megistos (Herbst). The defensive metabolites, a suite of unusual oxazole-containing macrolides, were isolated from the sponge, the nudibranch, and the nudibranch egg masses at 0.14â€“0.38, 0.14â€“0.62, and 2.65% of dry weight, respectively, and were effective inhibitors of feeding by T. lunare at minimum concentrations of 0.01â€“0.02% dry weight of food pellet. The macrolides were concentrated in the dorsal mantle of the nudibranch, which is most vulnerable to predatory attack, and in the combined digestive gland/gonad, site of both sponge digestion and egg production. The most abundant macrolide in the sponge tissue was not present in the nudibranch or its egg masses, suggesting that chemical modification of this compound takes place upon digestion. In a reef environment dominated by visually oriented predators, the striking color pattern and behavioral responses of Hexabranchus may have arisen with a concomitant elaboration of dietarily derived chemical defenses.",1988,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology
Estimating Networks: Lasso for Spatial Weights.,"In applied work, often the spatial neighbouring matrix is assumed known and available to the researcher. This paper provides a method for estimating it within longitudinal data. The salient feature is the ultra-high dimensionality of the problem, which is addressed with an adaptation of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso). The main result is that, under identification and sparsity conditions, the estimator is consistent for the true neighbouring matrix, both under L1 and prediction norms. The proposed model nests a graphical model and suggests several economic applications. Most notably, it provides a framework for estimating networks based on observable cohorts, as opposed to assuming prior knowledge. Finally, Monte Carlo evidence is presented, along with an application for contagion of government bond yields in the wake of the recent European crisis.",2012,
A North Adriatic centenarian: The marine research station at Rovinj,"The institute in Rovinj was founded in 1891 as the field station of the Berlin Aquarium. It soon gained in scientific importance. From 1911, it was governed by various scientific bodies, such as the â€˜Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft zur FÃ¶rderung der Wissenschaftenâ€™, the â€˜Reale Comitato Talassografico Italianoâ€™, and the â€˜Jugoslavenska Akademija znanosti i umjetnostiâ€™. At present, it is a department of the â€˜RuÄ‘er BoÅ¡koviÄ‡â€™ Institute, called the â€˜Center for Marine Research Rovinjâ€™. In the past hundred years, the Rovinj station experienced several ascents and declines in its development: both in the First and Second World Wars the station's scientific equipment, research vessels, library and reference collections were dispersed, and from 1945â€“1948 the station was closed. But in â€œhappierâ€ periods, rich support by the state and international bodies favoured the increase in research facilities and promoted interest among visiting scientists. The station has always been involved in studies of the Adriatic Sea, especially in its northern part. It contributed much to general knowledge of oceanography, of the physics and chemistry of the sea, but its paramount contribution is to various disciplines of marine biological sciences. Applied research, however, was most oriented to fisheries biology, especially shellfish culture, to resource studies, and, recently, to toxicology, bacteriology, eutrophication and pollution monitoring. The international approach in science and applied research was always favoured. At present, the Center is well equipped for complex coastal and offshore field- and laboratory research, and maintains facilities for graduate and postgraduate teaching. Scientific dissemination is also promoted by the public aquarium and professional meetings.",2006,HelgolÃ¤nder Meeresuntersuchungen
Lasso-optimal supersaturated design and analysis for factor screening in simulation experiments,"Xing, Dadi Ph.D., Purdue University, December 2015. LASSO-OPTIMAL SUPERSATURATED DESIGN AND ANALYSIS FOR FACTOR SCREENING IN SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS . Major Professor: Hong Wan and Michael Yu Zhu. Complex systems such as large-scale computer simulation models typically involve a large number of factors. When investigating such a system, screening experiments are often used to study these factors to identify a subgroup of factors that most significantly influence the interested response. A typical screening procedure consists of two steps: the experiment step and the analysis step. With a large number of factors, both of these two steps can be extremely challenging in practice. Currently there exists a disparity between the experimental designs and the analysis methods used for screening experiments. To address this disparity, our work focuses on analysis-method-directed optimal supersaturated designs for high-dimensional screening experiments. We use supersaturated designs and Lasso for the two steps of screening experiments, respectively; and we propose to optimize supersaturated designs toward the best performance of the Lasso. Specifically, we studied the variable selection performances of the lasso under finite samples and establish the exact relationship between the performances and the design matrix; we then developed the optimality criteria for constructing supersaturated designs that guarantee optimal variable selection performance, we studied the theoretical properties of the proposed criteria, and further developed efficient algorithms to construct optimal supersaturated designs. We also developed a software package capable of constructing optimal supersaturated designs and analyzing data generated from supersaturated experiments, and applied the package to study mission critical",2015,
Extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics in the limit of vanishing self-consistent field optimization.,"We present an efficient general approach to first principles molecular dynamics simulations based on extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics [A. M. N. Niklasson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 123004 (2008)] in the limit of vanishing self-consistent field optimization. The reduction of the optimization requirement reduces the computational cost to a minimum, but without causing any significant loss of accuracy or long-term energy drift. The optimization-free first principles molecular dynamics requires only one single diagonalization per time step, but is still able to provide trajectories at the same level of accuracy as ""exact,"" fully converged, Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations. The optimization-free limit of extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics therefore represents an ideal starting point for robust and efficient first principles quantum mechanical molecular dynamics simulations.",2013,The Journal of chemical physics
Lifting the curse of dimensionality Group-regularized elastic net regression in high dimensional space,"Introduction In genomics research, several different types of data are at the disposal of the researcher. The common denominator of these data types is high dimensionality of the data. Another characteristic of these types of data is the sparsity that is often expected or found. Prediction based on genomics data is complicated by these two issues. Often, extra information on the predictor variables is available, e.g. gene pathways or p-values from a previous study. In this thesis we propose two penalized regression methods for high dimensional data that make use of this extra information. Both methods are suitable for variable selection in a prediction setting. Methods The methods proposed are based on empirical Bayes techniques to estimate multiple penalty parameters. The different penalty parameters are estimated for groups of variables, where the groups are based on the extra information. Estimation is achieved by maximisation of the marginal likelihood of the penalty parameters. The first method proposed maximises the Laplace approximation of this marginal likelihood, while the second method maximises the Monte Carlo approximation of the likelihood. Predictive performance and variable selection of the Monte Carlo method is compared to penalization methods currently available in literature in both a simulation study and a real data example. Conclusion Maximisation of the Laplace approximated log-likelihood proved difficult and not feasible in high-dimensional space. The Monte Carlo approximated likelihood method was reasonably able to estimate the penalty parameters. The method outperformed traditional ridge, lasso and elastic net in terms of prediction. The method competes with GRridge, but is inferior to the group lasso. The proposed method achieves better variable selection than GRridge, ridge, lasso, elastic net and group lasso in most simulated settings. In the real data example performance of all methods is comparable.",2016,
Identification of a nomogram based on long non-coding RNA to improve prognosis prediction of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"PURPOSE
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains a common aggressive malignancy in the world. Several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to predict the prognosis of ESCC. Therefore, an in-depth research is urgently needed to further investigate the prognostic value of lncRNAs in ESCC.


RESULTS
From the training set, we identified a eight-lncRNA signature (including AP000487, AC011997, LINC01592, LINC01497, LINC01711, FENDRR, AC087045, AC137770) which separated the patients into two groups with significantly different overall survival (hazard ratio, HR = 3.79, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI [2.56-5.62]; P < 0.001). The signature was applied to the validation set (HR = 2.73, 95%CI [1.65-4.53]; P < 0.001) and showed similar prognostic values. Stratified, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the signature was an independent prognostic factor for patients with ESCC. A nomogram based on the lncRNAs signature, age, grade and stage was developed and showed good accuracy for predicting 1-, 3- and 5-year survival probability of ESCC patients. We found a strong correlation between the gene significance for the survival time and T stage. Eight modules were constructed, among which the key module most closely associated with clinical information was identified.


CONCLUSIONS
Our eight-lincRNA signature and nomogram could be practical and reliable prognostic tools for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.


METHODS
We downloaded the lncRNA expression profiles of ESCC patients from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets and separated to training and validation cohort. The univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to identify a lncRNA-based signature. The predictive value of the signature was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under curve (AUC). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to predict the intrinsic relationship between gene expressions. In addition, we further explored the combination of clinical information and module construction.",2020,Aging (Albany NY)
Application of CT-based radiomics in predicting portal pressure and patient outcome in portal hypertension.,"PURPOSE
Portal venous pressure (PVP) measurement is of clinical significance, especially in patients with portal hypertension. However, the invasive nature and associated complications limits its application. The aim of the study is to propose a noninvasive predictive model of PVP values based on CT-extracted radiomic features.


METHODS
Radiomics PVP (rPVP) models based on liver, spleen and combined features were established on an experimental cohort of 169 subjects. Radiomics features were extracted from each ROI and reduced via the LASSO regression to achieve an optimal predictive formula. A validation cohort of 62 patients treated for gastroesophageal varices (GOV) was used to confirm the utility of rPVP in predicting variceal recurrence. The association between rPVP and response to treatment was observed.


RESULTS
Three separate predictive formula for PVP were derived from radiomics features. rPVP was significantly correlated to patient response to endoscopic treatment for GOV. Among which, the model containing both liver and spleen features has the highest predictability of variceal recurrence, with an optimal cut-off value at 29.102â€¯mmHg (AUC 0.866). A Kaplan Meier analysis further confirmed the difference between patients with varying rPVP values.


CONCLUSION
PVP values can be accurately predicted by a non-invasive, CT derived radiomics model. rPVP serves as a non-invasive and precise reference for predicting treatment outcome for GOV secondary to portal hypertension.",2020,European journal of radiology

Best Linear Predictor with Missing Response: Locally Robust Approach,"This paper provides asymptotic theory for Inverse Probability Weighing (IPW) and Locally Robust Estimator (LRE) of Best Linear Predictor where the response missing at random (MAR), but not completely at random (MCAR). We relax previous assumptions in the literature about the first-step nonparametric components, requiring only their mean square convergence. This relaxation allows to use a wider class of machine leaning methods for the first-step, such as lasso. For a generic first-step, IPW incurs a first-order bias unless the model it approximates is truly linear in the predictors. In contrast, LRE remains first-order unbiased provided one can estimate the conditional expectation of the response with sufficient accuracy. An additional novelty is allowing the dimension of Best Linear Predictor to grow with sample size. These relaxations are important for estimation of best linear predictor of teacher-specific and hospital-specific effects with large number of individuals.",2017,
"Naming Colonialism: history and collective memory in the Congo, 1870â€“1960 (review)","The second part of the book aims at describing the French anthropological approaches to African studies. Here too, Bernardo Bernardi starts off with the forerunners (antesignani, in Italian): Ã‰mile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss. Then his overview tries to underline the well-known theoretical and methodological difference between French and British â€˜classicâ€™ anthropology: where the latter was more concerned with the social structure and the kinship systems, the French approach was mainly focused on symbolic systems, cosmogony and myths. Within the French tradition, Claude Meillassouxâ€™s and George Balandierâ€™s analyses are exceptions, being more concerned with economy and politics. With reference to Balandier, Bernardi, however, fails to describe some relevant concepts used by the French anthropologist, such as that of the situation coloniale or dynamisme, without apparent reason. Indeed, the chapter dedicated to George Balandier exemplifies the limits of Bernardo Bernardiâ€™s essay: the authorâ€™s concern is primarily descriptive. His approach deals essentially with the ethnographic data of his masters and colleagues; he does not offer a comprehensive analytical framework to discuss and compare the theoretical stances of his precursors, leaving the reader with a collection of summaries of research monographs. In the final part of the book Bernardi examines some Italian approaches to African studies: the research experiences of Vinigi Grottanelli among the Nzema of Ghana and the work of Francesco Remotti in the former ZaÃ¯re. The chapter dedicated to the thought of Lanternari on neo-traditionalism and religious syncretism offers an important contribution to understanding how Italian anthropology has contributed to advancing the discipline internationally. With Africanistica Bernardo Bernardi addresses three of the most important European schools of African Studies. Although the subtitle reads â€˜The oral cultures of Africaâ€™ and each chapter is apparently structured on the oral/written dichotomy, the concern with orality is less developed than the overall history of anthropology. Nevertheless Africanistica is not merely a textbook. It is the last testimony of the crucial influence of the British and French traditions on Italian anthropology, written in diary form by one of the most renowned scholars of the Italian tradition.",2010,Africa: The Journal of the International African Institute
Agronomic Practices for Reducing Wheat Yield Gaps: A Quantitative Appraisal of Progressive Producers,"There is limited information on agronomic practices affecting wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield in intensively managed dryland systems despite the opportunity to narrow the existing yield gap (YG). We used a unique database of 100 intensively managed field-years entered in the Kansas Wheat Yield Contest during the 2010 to 2017 harvest seasons to (i) quantify the YG, (ii) describe wheat management, and (iii) identify management opportunities and weather patterns associated with yield. We simulated wheat water-limited yield (Yw) using Simple Simulation Modelingâ€“Wheat (SSM-Wheat) model for each field-year to estimate YG as the difference between Yw and actual yield (Ya) and used 11 statistical approaches to test the association of management practices and weather variables with Ya. Wheat Ya averaged 5.5 Mg ha âˆ’1, and simulated Yw averaged 6.4 Mg ha âˆ’1, resulting in a YG of 0.9 Mg haâˆ’1 (15% of Yw). High-yielding fields had lower maximum and minimum temperatures and greater cumulative solar radiation and precipitation during grain fill. Varieties susceptible to fungal diseases responded to foliar fungicide (0.8â€“1.4 Mg haâˆ’1), whereas resistant varieties did not. Seeding rate was negatively associated with Ya, as yield quantile 0.99 was 7.5 Mg ha âˆ’1 and decreased by 2.7 Mg haâˆ’1 for every 100-seed mâˆ’2 increase in seeding rate above 305 seeds mâˆ’2. In-furrow P fertilizer, previous crop, tillage practice, and N timing were also associated with Ya. We conclude that fields entered in yield contests have closed the exploitable YG, and there are opportunities to improve Ya through improved management in regions with stagnant wheat yield. R.P.

New Genus of Oligoneuriidae (Ephemeroptera) from South America,"A new genus and two species, Fittkauneuria carina Pescador & Edmunds and F. adusta Pescador & Edmunds, from the highlands of Venezuela and Brazil, are described. The description of the genus is based on male imago, egg, and nymphs. Fittkauneuria carina is described from male imago and nymphs, whereas F. adusta is known only from nymphs. The male imago of Fittkauneuria is distinguished by the relatively numerous cross veins of the fore- and hind wings and lack of genital forceps; the nymph is distinguished by the epicranium which is strongly tapered anteriorly and has vestigial or weakly developed gill tufts.

Potential for therapy with AML-derived dendritic cells,"A number of studies suggest that a cellular immunotherapy is already an established and curative therapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Recent data from nonablative allogeneic stem cell transplants for AML at MD Anderson demonstrate that there is a graft-versus-leukemia affect associated with graft-versus-host disease in patients who have allografts for this disease. However, graft-versus-host disease is associated with substantial toxicity. Attempts have therefore been made to improve immunotherapeutic approaches. One approach has been to take myeloid leukemia cells and culture them in the presence of cytokines to generate dendritic cells. These dendritic cells are then able to stimulate autologous and allogeneic cytotoxic T cells. Dendritic cells exist in all tissues. They take up antigen, migrate to regional lymph nodes, and initiate primary T cellmediated immunity. They have abundant expression of core stimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD86, other adhesion molecules, and abundant surface class 1 and 2 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein. A number of studies are ongoing to utilize dendritic cells to present peptide antigens. Leukemic dendritic cells have been cultured from crude mononuclear cell preparations from bone marrow or peripheral blood of 30 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and AML of all FAB subtypes, in the presence of GMCSF, interleukin (IL)-4, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. More recently, CD40 ligand has been substituted for TNF-a. After coculture with autologous T cells and expansion with IL-2, these cells were tested as effectors in cytolytic and other assays. After culture, the cells resemble dendritic cells and express CD80 and CD86, along with the other dendritic cellassociated markers, CD1A and CD83. Similar results were obtained with the TNF-containing combination, the cytokine combination, and the CD40 ligand-containing combination. Karyotypic analysis demonstrated that the dendritic cells were derived from the original leukemia cells. When they are used to stimulate autologous T cells in culture, the T cells are cytolytic for the original leukemia.1 Recently, we have also been studying myelodysplastic syndromes and the ability of interferon-a to increase the terminal maturation of dendritic cells. We have demonstrated enhanced costimulatory molecule expression after interferona was added to the cultures. Tumor cells from AML and many myelodysplastic syndromes, as well as the majority of CML cases, will show differentiation toward dendritic cells, which may stimulate autologous antileukemic cytotoxicity. This cytotoxicity is leukemiaspecific and, in CML, HLA-restricted as demonstrated by anti-",2001,Leukemia
Screening active ingredients of rosemary based on spectrum-effect relationships between UPLC fingerprint and vasorelaxant activity using three chemometrics.,"Rosmarinus officinalis L., rosemary, is traditionally used to treat headache and improve cardiovascular disease partly due to its vasorelaxant activity, while the vasorelaxant ingredients remain unclear. In this study, chemical spectrum-pharmacological effect relationship (spectrum-effect relationship) was utilized for efficiently discovering the main vasorelaxant ingredients of rosemary. Ten kinds of rosemary extracts were prepared by different extracting solvents and macroporous resin purification, and their chemical components were analyzed by UPLC. At the same time, the vasorelaxant activities of the 10 kinds of rosemary extracts were estimated on isolated rat thoracic aorta, and three chemometrics named partial least squares regression (PLSR), grey correlation analysis (GRA), and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were applied to construct spectrum-effect relationship between the UPLC fingerprints and vasorelaxant activity of rosemary extracts. As a result, most rosemary extracts showed dose-dependent increase in vasorelaxant activity and five kinds of ingredients, including carnosol, carnosic acid, epirosmanol methyl ether, carnosol isomer, and augustic acid were screened as vasorelaxant ingredients. Further, the vasorelaxant activities of carnosic acid and carnosol were verified. Moreover, the increase of nitric oxide (NO) and the decrease of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) were thought to contribute to the vasorelaxant activity of rosemary.",2019,"Journal of chromatography.

T2L2) Time Transfer by Laser Link,"Abstract : T2L2 (Time Transfer by Laser Link) is a new generation time transfer experiment based on the principles of LASSO (Laser Synchronization from Synchronous Orbit) and used with an operational procedure developed at OCA (Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur) during the active intercontinental phase of LASSO. The hardware improvements could lead to a precision better than 10 ps for time transfer (flying clock monitoring or ground based clock comparison). Such a package could fly on any spacecraft with a stable clock. It is developed in France in the frame of the PHARAO project (cooled atom clock in orbit) involving CNES and different laboratories. But TZL2 could fly on any spacecraft carrying a stable oscillator. A GPS satellite would be a good candidate, as T2L2 could allow to link the flying clock directly to ground clocks using light, aiming to important accuracy checks, both for time and for geodesy. Radiostron (a flying VLBI antenna with an H-maser) is also envisioned, waiting for a PHARAO flight. The ultimate goal of T2L2 is to be part of more ambitious missions, as SORT (Solar Orbit Relativity Test), aiming to examine aspects of the gravitation in the vicinity of the Sun.",1994,
A model using concomitant markers for predicting outcome in human papillomavirus positive oropharyngeal cancer.,"OBJECTIVE
Head-neck cancer therapy has become intensified. With radiotherapy alone, 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) is 80% for HPV-positive TSCC/BOTSCC and better for patients with favorable characteristics, suggesting therapy could be tapered for some, decreasing side-effects. Therefore, we built a model to predict progression-free survival for patients with HPV-positive TSCC and BOTSCC.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
TSCC/BOTSCC patients treated curatively between 2000 and 2011, with HPV16 DNA/E7 mRNA positive tumors examined for CD8+ TILs, HPV16 mRNA and HLA class I expression were included. Patients were split randomly 65/35 into training and validation sets, and LASSO regression was used to select a model in the training set, the performance of which was evaluated in the validation set.


RESULTS
258 patients with HPV DNA/E7 mRNA positive tumors could be included, 168 and 90 patients in the respective sets. No treatment improved prognosis compared to radiotherapy alone. CD8+ TIL counts and young age were the strongest predictors of survival, followed by T-stage <3 and presence of HPV16 E2 mRNA. The model had an area under curve (AUC) of 76%. A model where the presence of three of four of these markers defined good prognosis captured 56% of non-relapsing patients with a positive predictive value of 98% in the validation set. Furthermore, the model identified 35% of our cohort that was overtreated and could safely have received de-escalated therapy.


CONCLUSION
CD8+ TIL counts, age, T-stage and E2 expression could predict progression-free survival, identifying patients eligible for randomized trials with milder treatment, potentially reducing side effects without worsening prognosis.",2017,Oral oncology
Long short-term memory networks and laglasso for bond yield forecasting: Peeping inside the black box,"Modern decision-making in fixed income asset management benefits from intelligent systems, which involve the use of state-of-the-art machine learning models and appropriate methodologies. We conduct the first study of bond yield forecasting using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, validating its potential and identifying its memory advantage. Specifically, we model the 10-year bond yield using univariate LSTMs with three input sequences and five forecasting horizons. We compare those with multilayer perceptrons (MLP), univariate and with the most relevant features. To demystify the notion of black box associated with LSTMs, we conduct the first internal study of the model. To this end, we calculate the LSTM signals through time, at selected locations in the memory cell, using sequence-to-sequence architectures, uni and multivariate. We then proceed to explain the statesâ€™ signals using exogenous information, for what we develop the LSTM-LagLasso methodology. The results show that the univariate LSTM model with additional memory is capable of achieving similar results as the multivariate MLP using macroeconomic and market information. Furthermore, shorter forecasting horizons require smaller input sequences and vice-versa. The most remarkable property found consistently in the LSTM signals, is the activation/deactivation of units through time, and the specialisation of units by yield range or feature. Those signals are complex but can be explained by exogenous variables. Additionally, some of the relevant features identified via LSTM-LagLasso are not commonly used in forecasting models. In conclusion, our work validates the potential of LSTMs and methodologies for bonds, providing additional tools for financial practitioners.",2020,ArXiv
Emotion recognition of faces and music in asperger syndrome: A crossmodal priming study,"Although autistic individuals are said by the general public to have impairments with emotion perception in social interactions, recent findings do not fully support this claim (Erbas et al., 2013). A study by Charbonneau et al. (2013) has shown that discrimination between two types of affective vocalizations and facial expressions, presented in isolation or in combination, was impaired in autistic individuals. However, controls and autistic individuals benefited from a bimodal presentation of the stimuli. Research on musical emotions has indicated that autistic individuals are not impaired in decoding musical emotions (e.g., Heaton, Hermelin, & Pring, 1999; Quintin et al., 2011). Furthermore, musical emotions have been shown to influence affective face processing in healthy individuals (Logeswaran & Bhattacharya, 2009; Marin et al., in prep). Motivated by the results of Charbonneau et al. (2013), we thus aim to systematically investigate the possible influence of musical emotions on emotion decoding of facial expressions in a crossmodal priming paradigm. Our sample comprises 15 high- functioning autistic individuals and 15 healthy controls matched for age, gender and IQ. Primes are excerpts of four types of musical emotions (happy, neutral, sad and scary). Targets are pictures of facial expressions (happy, neutral, sad and scary) taken from the Radboud Faces Database (Langner et al., 2010). In a two- alternative forced choice task, primes and targets of two types of emotions are paired in six combinations (happy-sad, sad-scary, happy-scary, neutral scary, neutral-sad and neutral- happy), and are either congruent or incongruent in terms of valence and/or arousal. This experimental design enables us to disentangle arousal from valence effects (Marin et al., 2012). The same discrimination task, collecting reaction time and accuracy data, will be performed for all stimuli in isolation in a separate session. We hypothesize that healthy controls will outperform autistic individuals on all tasks except for the musical emotion task. We hope to be able to demonstrate a crossmodal priming effect in healthy controls, but more importantly, also the presence of a reduced priming effect in autistic individuals. Our results may lead to further intervention studies in which listening to music may help to train autistic individuals to discriminate between facial expressions of emotion.

D-trace Precision Matrix Estimation Using Adaptive Lasso Penalties,"An accurate estimation of a precision matrix has a crucial role in the current age of high-dimensional data explosion. To deal with this problem, one of the prominent and commonly used techniques is the l1 norm (Lasso) penalization for a given loss function. This approach guarantees the sparsity of the precision matrix estimator for properly selected penalty parameters. However, the l1 norm penalization often fails to control the bias of the obtained estimator because of its overestimation behavior. In this paper, we introduce two adaptive extensions of the recently proposed l1 norm penalized D-trace loss minimization method. The proposed approaches intend to diminish the produced bias in the estimator. Extensive numerical results, using both simulated and real datasets, show the advantage of our proposed estimators.",2015,
Pathway Graphical Lasso,"Graphical models provide a rich framework for summarizing the dependencies among variables. The graphical lasso approach attempts to learn the structure of a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) by maximizing the log likelihood of the data, subject to an l1 penalty on the elements of the inverse co-variance matrix. Most algorithms for solving the graphical lasso problem do not scale to a very large number of variables. Furthermore, the learned network structure is hard to interpret. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel GGM structure learning method that exploits the fact that for many real-world problems we have prior knowledge that certain edges are unlikely to be present. For example, in gene regulatory networks, a pair of genes that does not participate together in any of the cellular processes, typically referred to as pathways, is less likely to be connected. In computer vision applications in which each variable corresponds to a pixel, each variable is likely to be connected to the nearby variables. In this paper, we propose the pathway graphical lasso, which learns the structure of a GGM subject to pathway-based constraints. In order to solve this problem, we decompose the network into smaller parts, and use a message-passing algorithm in order to communicate among the subnetworks. Our algorithm has orders of magnitude improvement in run time compared to the state-of-the-art optimization methods for the graphical lasso problem that were modified to handle pathway-based constraints.",2015,Proceedings of the ...

Biologically Active Nucleosides and Nucleotides: Conformational Features and Interactions with Enzymes,"The current widespread interest in analogues of nucleosides and nucleotides, and to some extent the aglycon moieties of these, as antimetabolic agents stems logically from the inference that they may inhibit one or more steps in the metabolic pathway(s) leading to the biosynthesis of nucleic acids, and that such inhibition may exhibit a certain degree of selectivity towards tumour cells or viruses (Herrmann, 1977; Cohen, 1979; Fields and Greene, 1982). A number of such heterocyclic bases and nucleoside analogues are, in fact, now widely employed as experimental antitumour and antiviral agents, with some of them approved for clinical use (Bloch, 1975; Herrmann, 1977; Collier and Oxford, 1980; Smith and Kirkpatrick, 1980; Smith et al., 1980; Galasso, 1981; Shugar, 1981; Hirsch and Schooley, 1983; Stuart-Harris and Oxford, 1983; De Clercq and Walker, 1984; Shugar, 1984, 1985). At least in the case of antiviral agents, which will be emphasised in this chapter, a good deal of information has now been accumulated regarding their mechanism(s) of action, in large part because of the significant advances in our knowledge of the molecular biology of viral replication (Baltimore, 1976; Herrmann, 1977; Cohen, 1979; Fields and Greene, 1982). In particular, a relatively frequent requirement in the case of many nucleosides is the necessity for their prior intracellular phosphorylation (or â€˜activationâ€™) to the metabolically active forms.",1987,
Modeling of Biological Data Based on Regression Methods,"The ordinary least square estimates of multiple regression parameters is characterized by low bias and large variance leading to poor performance in both prediction and interpretation of the regression model under study.

Categorical regression algorithm provides efficient procedure for computing the regression coefficients of ridge, lasso, and elastic Net models. The statistical analysis was done on ten single nucleotide polymorphisms simulated data with strong linkage disequilibrium as predictors of a continuous phenotypic trait. The coefficients were 39%, 34%, 29% and 28% for ridge, elastic net, lasso and stepwise multiple regression methods, respectively.

"Alteration and the role of fluids in Ni, Cu and platinum-group element deposition, Sudbury Igneous Complex contact, Onaping-Levack area, Ontario","SummaryA variety of alteration styles is associated with Cu, Ni and platinum-group element deposition in the Onaping-Levack area of the North Range of the Sudbury Structure. Two significant alteration assemblages are amphibole (actinolite) + epidote + chlorite + quartz Â± albite Â± K-feldspar Â± calcite adjacent to Cu-rich veins in the Deep Copper Zone of Strathcona mine and the nearby Barnet property, and amphibole (actinolite to ferro-actinolite) + epidote + titanite + pentlandite + pyrite Â±quartz Â± magnetite in the Fraser mine Epidote Zone. The concentrically zoned Epidote Zone alteration has been further subdivided into facies that range from epidotized Footwall Breccia through actinolite-bearing rocks with few vestiges of original Footwall Breccia textures, to the most intensely altered magnetite-rich facies. Higher Fe3+ content in epidote in the most intensely altered rocks is compatible with the evolution of more oxidized fluids with time. Fe and Ni, in addition to Cu and PGE, have been mobilized. The 2- (L + V) and 3- (L + V + SC) phase fluid inclusions are similar in each of the deposit locations. Temperatures of first ice melting range from âˆ’64.9 to -42.3Â°C, indicating that the trapped fluids may be modelled in the system H2O-NaCl-CaCl2. Average salinities are high, between 20.8 to 34.4 NaCl wt.% eq., and show considerable overlap for each deposit. Isochores calculated from these data show a decrease in temperature range from the Epidote Zone (230 to 340Â°C) through Barnet (210 to 295Â°C) to the most distal Deep Copper Zone (175 to 280Â°C). The Cl-rich fluids deposited Cu and platinum-group elements in the Deep Copper Zone as a result of this thermal gradient. The high salinity fluid inclusions of the Sudbury North Range are similar to those from other high and intermediate temperature Cu-Ni-PGE deposits, and suggest that they were the result of late-stage hydrothermal activity within contact units of the Sudbury Igneous Complex.ZusammenfassungPlatingruppen-Elementen im Onaping-Levack-Gebiet der North Range der Sudburystruktur verbunden.

Regenerative Simulation for the Bayesian Lasso,"The Gibbs sampler of Park and Casella is one of the most popular MCMC methods for sampling from the posterior density of the Bayesian Lasso regression. As with many Markov chain samplers, their Gibbs sampler lacks a theoretically sound method of output analysis --- a method for estimating the variance of a given ergodic average and estimating how closely the chain is sampling from the stationary distribution, that is, the burn-in. 
In this paper, we address this shortcoming by identifying regenerative structure in the sampler of Park and Casella, thus providing a theoretically sound method of assessing its performance. The regenerative structure provides both a strongly consistent variance estimator, and an estimator of (an upper bound on) the total variation distance from the target posterior density. The result is a simple and theoretically sound way to assess the stationarity of the Park and Casella and, more generally, other MCMC samplers, for which regenerative simulation is possible. 
We perform a numerical study in which we validate the standard errors calculated by our regenerative method by comparing it with the standard errors calculated by an AR(1) heuristic approximation. Thus, we show that for the Bayesian Lasso model, the regenerative method is a viable and theoretically justified alternative to the existing ad-hoc MCMC convergence diagnostics.",2018,arXiv: Computation
A Super-Resolution DOA Estimation Method for Fast-Moving Targets in MIMO Radar,"Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is an essential problem in the radar systems. In this paper, the problem of DOA estimation is addressed in the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar system for the fast-moving targets. A virtual aperture is provided by orthogonal waveforms in the MIMO radar to improve the DOA estimation performance. Different from the existing methods, we consider the DOA estimation method with only one snapshot for the fast-moving targets and achieve the super-resolution estimation from the snapshot. Based on a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), a denoise method is formulated to obtain a sparse approximation to the received signals, where the sparsity is measured by a new type of atomic norm for the MIMO radar system. However, the denoise problem cannot be solved efficiently. Then, by deriving the dual norm of the new atomic norm, a semidefinite matrix is constructed from the denoise problem to formulate a semidefinite problem with the dual optimization problem. Finally, the DOA is estimated by peak-searching the spatial spectrum. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves better performance of the DOA estimation in the MIMO radar system with only one snapshot.",2020,Mathematical Problems in Engineering
Sparse covariance estimation under Kronecker product structure,"We introduce a sparse covariance estimation method for the high dimensional setting when the covariance matrix decomposes as a Kronecker product, i.e., Î£0 = A0 âŠ— B0, and the observations are Gaussian. We propose an â„“1 penalized maximum-likelihood approach to solve this problem. The dual formulation motivates an iterative algorithm (penalized flip-flop; FFP) based on a block coordinate-descent approach. Although the â„“1-penalized log-likelihood function (objective function) is non-convex in general and non-smooth, we show that FFP converges to a local maximum under relatively mild assumptions. For the fixed dimension case, large-sample statistical consistency is proved and a rate of convergence bound is derived. Simulations show that FFP outperforms its non-penalized counterpart and the naive Glasso algorithm for sparse Kronecker-decomposable covariance matrix.",2012,"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
"Following associations with the striped red mullet Mullus surmuletus Linnaeus, 1758 (Perciformes: Mullidae) from the Azores","In this study we report Mullus surmuletus being followed intraspecifically and by individual fish of the following species: Thalassoma pavo, Coris julis, Diplodus sargus cadenati and Serranus atricauda.

Measuring child mortality from maternity histories collected at time of childbirth. Case of the EMIS surveys.,A researcher has developed a new research methodology to indirectly estimate infant mortality using data from conditional samples which usually are from hospitals or health centers. This methodology is different from other similar methodologies in that it groups mothers by parity instead of age or marital duration. Parity is used since it is more likely to be accurately mortality levels by the mean length of the birth interval. Mortality patterns are not sensitive to the length of the birth interval. He uses data from the 1983 EMIS follow up survey conducted in Bobodioulasso Burkina Faso and 1919 1924 and 1933 data from birth registration areas in the United States to demonstrate the new methodology. The methodology shows that the estimated infant mortality rate (IMR) remained basically the same between 1968-1974 in Bobodioulasso (199-122) and began to fall in 1975. By 1983 it had fallen to 88. These results reflect the estimate from the EMIS survey. The methodology demonstrates that in the US estimated trends in IMR agreed with observed IMRs. The new methodology derived IMRs fell in the US between 1919-1932 from 92.8-65.5. Since maternity clinics and hospitals in many Sub-Saharan African countries maintain records with answers to routine questions the new methodology can analyze these data to determine infant mortality trends. Yet conditional samples are not necessarily representative of the whole population. Thus researchers could apply data from unconditional samples such as those from the World Fertility Survey and the Demographic and Health Surveys to a variety of indirect estimation methods discussed in this report to complement the estimated trends of the conditional samples.,1991,
Aranjuez with a Blue Guitar,"abstractA constructed memory of the moment I first heard Miles Davis playing the ""Concierto de Aranjuez"" on the Sketches of Spain album served to structure with pleasure my transition from elementary school to Junior High School. The unraveling of this memory more than fifty years later demonstrated how the idea of trumpet playing and overseas travel served to master associations I had to Spain as an intrusive power.PsyArt Conference, Instituto de Investigacao em Arte, Design e Sociedade, School of Fine Arts, University of Porto, Portugal, June, 2013.""History is ... what you can remember. All other history defeats itself."" -W. C. Sellar and R. J. Yeatman, 1066 and All That (authors' italics).Here is what I remember:In Roxanne's room, there is a pale-blue phonograph, about twelve inches square, set on its own small table next to an east-facing window. It is an autumn afternoon, and the sun is shining. I am about eleven years old. Roxanne and I are in the same class at school, though I don't remember her from there.Roxanne opens the little traveling-case record-player and puts on a record. I hear castanets, a guitar, and the sounds of someplace far away, overseas. The music is beautiful and sad, unlike anything I have ever heard before. Out comes an amazing, rising trumpet solo that is even more beautifully sad, solitary with some kind of military-background snare drums.On April 1, 1966, I buy a record, Miles Davis, Sketches of Spain. When I play it, out comes the sound of castanets and a mournful trumpet with an orchestra supporting it. I hear the ""Concierto de Aranjuez,"" and am transported back to 1955. I see Roxanne's room and that afternoon very clearly, and remember how transfixed I was by first hearing this melody. My introduction to jazz, it remains a threshold memory of my world opening out. The fusion of jazz with classical music creates part of its appeal, bringing American individualism and improvisation together with European traditions. I think I can hear a bullfight and the Spanish civil war of the 1930s in the background of the album. The sound of it transports me both to the past and overseas.In 2011, a childhood friend posts on Facebook a picture taken during a sixth-grade class trip to Albany, New York in 1955, when we met then-Governor Averill Harriman, who appears in the center of this photograph. Facebook friends from that class begin tagging people in the photo. I notice that Roxanne has been tagged as ""Unknown,"" so I suggest in the photo's comment section that the unknown girl is Roxanne. Nobody seems to remember Roxanne except me. I have a very clear memory of the day I heard Miles Davis in her room in Tannersville, New York; but that is all I remember about her.I find Roxanne listed with a website of paintings associated with an art gallery on the east end of Long Island, New York. Via the gallery's website, I email Roxanne asking her whether she lived in Tannersville in the 1950s. When, after some hesitation and rigmarole in regard to a recent identity theftshe experienced, she replies that yes, she is that Roxanne, I send her a copy of the Albany photograph and ask her if she is the girl I had thought must be her in the picture. After some confusion, it emerges that yes, the girl tagged as unknown is indeed who I thought she was.I describe to Roxanne the day in her room when, I remember, I first heard Sketches of Spain. Roxanne replies ""You remember me to have had much more sophisticated musical tastes than I remember having, although 78 rpm does ring a bell.""I tell Roxanne I am thinking of going to Gurney's Spa in Montauk for Thalassotherapy and staying not far from where Roxanne is now living. I think of how driving New York Route 27 to land's end at Montauk on a clear summer day with the car roof and windows open to the blue of the sky and the blue of the ocean on both sides of the island gives me a sense of infinity. I think of the East End of Long Island as a sensational place, a summertime paradise. â€¦",2013,
"Pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression in hip pathology.","AIMS
Psychological factors play a critical role in patient presentation, satisfaction, and outcomes. Pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression are important to consider, as they are associated with poorer outcomes and are potentially modifiable. The aim of this study was to assess the level of pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression in patients with a range of hip pathology and to evaluate their relationship with patient-reported psychosocial and functional outcome measures.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients presenting to a tertiary-centre specialist hip clinic were prospectively evaluated for outcomes of pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression. Validated assessments were undertaken such as: the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), and the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Patient characteristics and demographics were also recorded. Multiple linear regression modelling, with adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) variable selection, was used for analysis.


RESULTS
A total of 328 patients were identified for inclusion, with diagnoses of hip dysplasia (DDH; n = 50), femoroacetabular impingement (FAI; n = 55), lateral trochanteric pain syndrome (LTP; n = 23), hip osteoarthrosis (OA; n = 184), and avascular necrosis of the hip (AVN; n = 16) with a mean age of 31.0 years (14 to 65), 38.5 years (18 to 64), 63.7 years (20 to 78), 63.5 years (18 to 91), and 39.4 years (18 to 71), respectively. The percentage of patients with abnormal levels of pain catastrophizing, anxiety, or depression was: 22.0%, 16.0%, and 12.0% for DDH, respectively; 9.1%, 10.9%, and 7.3% for FAI, respectively; 13.0%, 4.3%, and 4.3% for LTP, respectively; 21.7%, 11.4%, and 14.1% for OA, respectively; and 25.0%, 43.8%, and 6.3% for AVN, respectively. HADS Anxiety (HADSA) and Hip Disability Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Activities of Daily Living subscale (HOOS ADL) predicted the PCS total (adjusted R2 = 0.4599). Age, HADS Depression (HADSD), and PCS total predicted HADSA (adjusted R2 = 0.4985). Age, HADSA, patient's percentage of perceived function, PCS total, and HOOS Quality of Life subscale (HOOS QOL) predicted HADSD (adjusted R2 = 0.5802).


CONCLUSION
Patients with hip pathology may exhibit significant pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression. Identifying these factors and understanding the impact of psychosocial function could help improve patient treatment outcomes. Perioperative multidisciplinary assessment may be a beneficial part of comprehensive orthopaedic hip care. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2019;101-B:800-807.",2019,The bone & joint journal

Startingwith the precisespecificationsof the applicationalgorithms,an appropriateschedulingmethodis first appliedto optimizethedataflow. TheactualVLSI implementationis thenperformed,resortingto parameterizedcell compilers for the automaticgenerationof the primary modules.As an example,the implementationof an adaptivespectralsharpening algorithmsuitablefor futureall-digital hearingaidsis discussed. Theresultingsilicon areais approximately4 mm2 for a 1.2 m CMOS process, and the estimated power consumption at a sampling rate of 8 kHz is about 4 mW at 5V (0.65 mW at 2V).

Intr oduction In the fields of telecommunications, hearingaids,and electronic instrumentation, thereis animportantdemandfor newgenerations of high performanceportableapplications.The requirementsof suchapplicationsaremanifold, andcanbe expressedin termsof improved functionalities,enhancedminiaturization,and reduced power consumption to extend the system autonomy. For flexibility andefficiency reasons,the signalprocessingfacilitiesto beincorporatedaremoreandmorerealizeddigitally ondedicatedASICs.However,in orderto achieveoptimalsolutionswith respecto thepowerconsumption, thedesignsshouldbeperformed coherentlyand carefully at all levels, including the algorithmic, architectural, logical, and layout levels. This paperproposesa contributionto the designandoptimization of low powerVLSI architecturessuitablefor effectiveimplementationsof variousdigital signalprocessing(DSP)algorithmssuch asFIR andIIR filters, adaptivefilters, andFouriertransforms,with a particularstrengthon the power consumptionwhich shouldbe kept as low as possible. Theprinciplesof theproposedarchitecturearediscussedin Chapter 2, whereasChapter3 presentstheprimary functionalmodules. Thedesignof thesemoduleshasbeenperformeddownto the layout level to get a preciseestimationof the achievedperformance. Hence,a set of functional moduleshas beendeveloped,which, whenproperlyassembledandparameterized, providean efficient solutionfor theASIC implementationof a broadvarietyof digital filtering algorithms. Finally, Chapter4 presentsanapplicationexamplefor anadaptive spectral sharpening algorithm for digital hearing aids. 2. Processor ar chitecture For digital CMOScircuits,thepowerconsumptionis knownto be essentiallydeterminedby thedynamicconsumption,which canbe expressed as [1] : P = f Â· Ceq Â· Vdd2 (EQ 1) wheref is theclock rate,Ceqtheequivalentcapacitance, andVdd the supply voltageof the consideredcircuit. All threequantities should be kept as low as possible. Substantialsavingscanbeachievedwith respectto theequivalent capacitanceCeqby strictly limiting theprocessingactivitiesto the resourcesprovidinga directcontributionto the requiredcomputations. Hence, the next principles were applied : a) Idle modules should be set into a po wer-saving STAND-BY mode. b) Theprocessor architectureandmodulesshouldbeorganizedin a way to limit the overall data transfer to the strict minimum, local data traf fic being preferred v ersus global traf fic. c) Larger memories should be split into a set of smaller memories, where a single one is acti ve at a time. Also, the structuralregularityof most DSPalgorithmsshouldbe utilized to simplify both the schedulingand the hardwareimplementation. Finally, thereis aglobaltrade-offto bedeterminedbetweenf, Ceq, andVdd in orderto obtaintheoptimalpowerconsumption. Indeed, reducingthesupplyvoltagelowersthemaximumachievableclock ratedueto theincreasedsignalpropagationdelay.Hence,in order to copewith therequiredcomputationthroughput,it is usuallynecessaryto extendthe parallelismof the architecture[2], which in turn will haveaneffecton theequivalentcapacitance! In this context, thearchitectureshouldbeflexible enoughto let thedegreeof parallelism be best fitted to the considered application. 2.1 Proposed solution Thedataflow of mostDSPalgorithmsfeaturesa sequential access to the data (e.g. filter coefficientsand statevariables),and it is thereforepossibleto recourseto sequentialmemoriesfor the data storage.This solutiondrasticallysimplifies the dataaddresscomputation and decoding,and the signal data updatingrequiredat each sampling period is merely achieved by virtual data shifts. This conceptcanalsobeappliedto morecomplexalgorithmssuch as adaptivefilters and Fourier transforms,adjustingthe memory addressing scheme when required.",1994,
