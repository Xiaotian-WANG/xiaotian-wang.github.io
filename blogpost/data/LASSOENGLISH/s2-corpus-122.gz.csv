Sparse-Based Feature Selection for Discriminating Between Crops and Weeds Using Field Images,"Control of weed growing in yields is a critical task for reducing crop losses. Recently, image-based systems attempt to discriminate between crops and weeds from a set of features. Although some features have a physiological meaning, most of them are redundant or noisy. Therefore, selecting relevant features must result in interpretable and accurate results while reducing the computational complexity of the system. In this work, we introduce a sparse-based feature selection approach using the Lasso operator that eliminates noisy features aiming to improve the classification of crops. We evaluate our proposal on the Crop/Weed Field Image Dataset, for which we tune the parameters by maximizing the accuracy and minimizing feature dimension. Achieved performance results evidence that our proposed approach improves discrimination in comparison with other feature selection approaches, with the benefit of providing interpretability in weed/crop discrimination tasks.",2019,
Exploiting Correlation Consensus: Towards Subspace Clustering for Multi-modal Data,"Often, a data object described by many features can be decomposed as multi-modalities, which always provide complementary information to each other. In this paper, we study subspace clustering for multi-modal data by effectively exploiting data correlation consensus across modalities, while keeping individual modalities well encapsulated. Our technique can yield a more ideal data similarity matrix, which encodes strong data correlations for the cross-modal data objects in the same subspace.
 To these ends, we propose a novel angular based regularizer coupled with our objective function, which is aided by trace lasso and minimized to yield sparse representation vectors encoding data correlations in multiple modalities. As a result, the sparse code vectors of the same cross-modal data have small angular difference so as to achieve the data correlation consensus simultaneously. This can generate a compatible data similarity matrix for multi-modal data. The final subspace clustering result is obtained by applying spectral clustering on such data similarity matrix. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by experiments conducted on real-world image datasets.",2014,
Generalized t-statistic for two-group classification.,"In the classic discriminant model of two multivariate normal distributions with equal variance matrices, the linear discriminant function is optimal both in terms of the log likelihood ratio and in terms of maximizing the standardized difference (the t-statistic) between the means of the two distributions. In a typical case-control study, normality may be sensible for the control sample but heterogeneity and uncertainty in diagnosis may suggest that a more flexible model is needed for the cases. We generalize the t-statistic approach by finding the linear function which maximizes a standardized difference but with data from one of the groups (the cases) filtered by a possibly nonlinear function U. We study conditions for consistency of the method and find the function U which is optimal in the sense of asymptotic efficiency. Optimality may also extend to other measures of discriminatory efficiency such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The optimal function U depends on a scalar probability density function which can be estimated non-parametrically using a standard numerical algorithm. A lasso-like version for variable selection is implemented by adding L1-regularization to the generalized t-statistic. Two microarray data sets in the study of asthma and various cancers are used as motivating examples.",2015,Biometrics
Inferring Ecological Networks From Species Abundance Data,"Network reconstruction methods are commonly used in molecular biology to construct regulatory networks from information about the expression values of genes in a cell. In ecology, we are presented with a similar problem when trying to reconstruct species interaction networks based on species abundance data. The aim of this project was to see if the methods that proved successful in molecular biology could be applied to this new problem. The methods that I applied and compared were Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Sparse Bayesian Regression (SBR), Graphical Gaussian Models (GGMs) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). To evaluate the performance of these methods, I used data derived from a realistic population simulation model, based on a niche model of species interactions. The experiments showed that these methods were successful at reconstructing the species interaction networks, and that the comparatively simple LASSO, SBR and GGM methods performed as well if not better than the more complex Bayesian Network approaches.",2008,
A simple method of meniscus repair using the arthroscopic outside-in technique.,"We describe a simple method of arthroscopic outside-in meniscus repair that is easy to perform using readily available materials. The technique uses a 19-gauge venepuncture needle, a 16-gauge epidural needle, a No. 3 Prolene suture as a lasso loop, and No. 2 polydioxanone (PDS) sutures for meniscus repair. The venepuncture needle is used to puncture the meniscus from outside-in to deliver the Prolene lasso loop suture. The epidural needle is used to deliver one end of the PDS repair suture through the lasso loop. This suture end is captured by tightening the lasso loop, and delivered out of the joint by withdrawing the venepuncture needle. The epidural needle is kept in the joint. A second pass is made with the venepuncture needle at an appropriate site on the meniscus, and the lasso loop delivered. The other free end of the repair suture is threaded through the epidural needle and through the lasso loop. This other repair suture end is similarly captured and delivered out of the joint. The repair is completed by pulling on the free ends of the repair suture to apply it across the meniscus tear site, and secured by tying the suture to the capsule through a small incision.",2006,Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association
Machine Learning Techniques for Detecting Hierarchical Interactions in Insurance Claims Models,"This thesis presents an intuitive way to do predictive modeling in actuarial science. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are the standard tool for predictive modeling in the actuarial literature and in actuarial practice, yet GLMs can be quite restrictive. The aim of this work is to model claims and to propose solutions to current actuarial problems such as high variability in large data-sets, variable selection, overfitting, dealing with highly correlated variables and detecting non-linear effects such as interactions. 
 
Regularization techniques are crucial for modeling big data, which means dealing with high-dimensionality, sometimes noisy data that often contains many irrelevant predictors. Penalized regression is a set of regression techniques that impose a constraint/penalty on the regression coefficients and can be used as a powerful variable selection tool as well. They are a generalization of GLMs and include techniques such as Ridge regression, lasso, group-lasso and Elastic Net. The proposed approach is a hierarchical group-lasso-type model that can efficiently handle variable selection and interaction detection between variables while enforcing strong hierarchy. This is achieved by imposing a penalty on the coefficients at the individual and group level. By optimizing the penalized objective function the model performs variable selection and estimation. Additionally, the model automatically detects interactions which is another important factor to achieve a high predictive power. For those purposes the group-lasso method is investigated for the Poisson and gamma distributions to perform frequency-severity modeling.",2016,
Estimation of metabolite networks with regard to a specific covariable: applications to plant and human data,"IntroductionIn systems biology, where a main goal is acquiring knowledge of biological systems, one of the challenges is inferring biochemical interactions from different molecular entities such as metabolites. In this area, the metabolome possesses a unique place for reflecting â€œtrue exposureâ€ by being sensitive to variation coming from genetics, time, and environmental stimuli. While influenced by many different reactions, often the research interest needs to be focused on variation coming from a certain source, i.e. a certain covariable $$\mathbf {X}_m$$Xm.ObjectiveHere, we use network analysis methods to recover a set of metabolite relationships, by finding metabolites sharing a similar relation to $$\mathbf {X}_m$$Xm. Metabolite values are based on information coming from individualsâ€™ $$\mathbf {X}_m$$Xm status which might interact with other covariables.MethodsAlternative to using the original metabolite values, the total information is decomposed by utilizing a linear regression model and the part relevant to $$\mathbf {X}_m$$Xm is further used. For two datasets, two different network estimation methods are considered. The first is weighted gene co-expression network analysis based on correlation coefficients. The second method is graphical LASSO based on partial correlations.ResultsWe observed that when using the parts related to the specific covariable of interest, resulting estimated networks display higher interconnectedness. Additionally, several groups of biologically associated metabolites (very large density lipoproteins, lipoproteins, etc.) were identified in the human data example.ConclusionsThis work demonstrates how information on the study design can be incorporated to estimate metabolite networks. As a result, sets of interconnected metabolites can be clustered together with respect to their relation to a covariable of interest.",2017,Metabolomics

T2L2 on JASON-2: First Evaluation of the Flying Model,"Abstract : The new generation of optical time transfer (T2L2: Time Transfer by Laser Link [1]) under development at OCA and CNES shall allow the synchronization of remote ultra-stable clocks and the determination of their performances over intercontinental distances. The principle is based on the propagation of light pulses between clocks for synchronization. T2L2 is the follow on mission to LASSO [2] (LAser Synchronization from Stationary Orbit) with performances improved by two orders of magnitude. A T2L2 payload shall be launched in mid 2008, together with the Jason-2 space vehicle dedicated to the observation of the oceans. A preliminary performance budget and a ground experiment conducted by the OCA permit to envision a performance improvement of at least one order of magnitude as compared to the best time transfer techniques available. Expected performances are in the 100 ps range for accuracy, with an ultimate stability better than 1 ps over 1000 s (one pass) and than 10 ps over 1 day. Time transfer performances in a common view mode are driven by the noise of both the ground and the onboard timers, whereas the performances in a non-common view configuration are limited by the onboard clock (DORIS USO). The main objectives of the T2L2 mission are technological (In-orbit functional and performance validation), scientific (Time & Frequency metrology and Fundamental physics tests), and a contribution to the Jason-2 core mission (Evaluation of the behaviors, versus radiations, of the DORIS USO).",2006,
RNA processing genes characterize RNA splicing and further stratify lower-grade glioma.,"BACKGROUND
Aberrant expression of RNA processing genes may drive the alterative RNA profile in lower-grade gliomas (LGGs). Thus, we aimed to further stratify LGGs based on the expression of RNA processing genes.


METHODS
This study included 446 LGGs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, training set) and 171 LGGs from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA, validation set). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression algorithm was conducted to develop a risk-signature. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to study the prognosis value of the risk-signature.


RESULTS
Among the tested 784 RNA processing genes, 276 were significantly correlated with the OS of LGGs. Further LASSO Cox regression identified a 19-gene risk-signature, whose risk score was also an independently prognosis factor (P<0.0001, multiplex Cox regression) in the validation dataset. The signature had better prognostic value than the traditional factors ""age"", ""grade"" and ""WHO 2016 classification"" for 3- and 5-year survival both two datasets (AUCs > 85%). Importantly, the risk-signature could further stratify the survival of LGGs in specific subgroups of WHO 2016 classification. Furthermore, alternative splicing events for genes such as EGFR and FGFR were found to be associated with the risk score. mRNA expression levels for genes, which participated in cell proliferation and other processes, were significantly correlated to the risk score.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results highlight the role of RNA processing genes for further stratifying the survival of patients with LGGs and provide insight into the alternative splicing events underlying this role.",2019,JCI insight
Radiomics analysis of magnetic resonance imaging improves diagnostic performance of lymph node metastasis in patients with cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Robust parameters are needed to predict lymph node metastasis (LNM) in locally advanced cervical cancer patients in order to select optimal treatment regimen. The aim of this study is to utilize radiomics analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to improve diagnostic performance of LNM in cervical cancer patients.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 189 cervical cancer patients were divided into a training cohort (nâ€¯=â€¯126) and a validation cohort (nâ€¯=â€¯63). For each patient, we extracted radiomic features from intratumoral and peritumoral tissues on sagittal T2WI and axial apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Afterward, the radiomic features associated with LNM status were selected by univariate ROC testing and logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty in the training cohort. Based on the selected features, a support vector machine (SVM) model was established to predict LNM status. To further improve the diagnostic performance, a decision tree which combines the radiomics model with clinical factors was built.


RESULTS
Radiomics model of the intratumoral and peritumoral tissues on T2WI (T2tumor+peri) showed best sensitivity and clinical LN (c-LN) status showed best specificity to predict LNM. The decision tree that combines radiomics model of T2tumor+peri and c-LN status achieved best diagnostic performance, with AUC and sensitivity of 0.895 and 94.3%, 0.847 and 100% in the training and validation cohort respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
The decision tree, which incorporates radiomics model of T2tumor+peri and c-LN status can be potentially applied in the preoperative prediction of LNM in locally advanced cervical cancer patients.",2019,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology
Dentition in Marine Vertebrates,"Although mechanisms of niche replacement are discussed thoroughly in the evolutionary paleontological literature (i.e., extinctions, competition, evolution of new adaptive morphologies), actual studies involving quantitative analyses are not common. In this study, morphological features of dentition in Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic marine vertebrate predators were analyzed.The analysis included species of Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic sharks, Late Cretaceous marine reptiles, and Cenozoic marine mammals. Dental characters used in the study were both discrete and continuous. Species included in the analysis were originally collected from Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic rocks from the south-central, southeastern, and the mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, as well as Europe and the Pacific Rim. A morphometric â€œtooth spaceâ€ was constructed using the eigenvectors generated from Principal Component Analysis of the dental character data.The results of the analysis show that Mesozoic marine reptiles occupied a small, discrete region of the tooth morphospace, whereas Cretaceous sharks occupied a much larger, diffuse region of the morphospace. During the Paleogene a profusion of shark tooth morphologies occurred and then expanded into new areas of tooth morphospace.Yet, no overlap with the morphospace previously occupied by Mesozoic marine reptiles occurred.A large number of novel tooth morphologies evolved with the evolution of marine mammals during the Cenozoic. Remarkably, many of the tooth forms converged on the Mesozoic marine reptile designs, and hence a major overlap of marine mammal tooth morphospace with the previously occupied Mesozoic marine reptile morphospace occurred.Additionally, the shift from heterodonty (teeth of different types) to homodonty (teeth of similar types) occurred in several members of both the Mesozoic marine reptiles and the Cenozoic marine mammals. Based on dental morphology, this study indicates that following the extinction of the Mesozoic marine reptiles during the Late Cretaceous, Cenozoic sharks failed to occupy the vacated niches, yet Cenozoic marine mammal dentition converged on the previous Mesozoic marine reptile tooth designs.Apparently, Cenozoic marine mammals occupied the vacated Mesozoic marine reptile dietary niches. The Sedimentary Record December 2005 | 5 marine reptiles have a homodont dentition (teeth of similar types), but in many cases, e.g., ichthyosaurs, homodonty is a derived character (Massare and Calloway, 1990). Cetaceans and pinnipeds (Cenozoic marine mammals) â€“ The predominant Cenozoic vertebrate predators belong to the mammalian orders Cetacea (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and Pinnipedia (seals, sea-lions, and walruses). The first known cetaceans date to the early Eocene (Gingerich et al., 1983). Early whales, the protocetids and basilosaurids, had a heterodont dentition (teeth of different types). Molars are generally multi-cusped and have a more complicated form than premolars. The early cetaceans could use their dentition to shear and grind, as well as pierce and secure their prey (Fordyce, 1982). Later cetaceans, including the modern odontocetes (toothed whales, dolphins, and porpoises) have a homodont dentition. Some delphinids (oceanic whales and dolphins) have sharp, pointed, slender teeth that are used to pierce and secure their prey, while killer whales have sharp, robust teeth used not only for cutting flesh, but also for chopping and breaking bones (Massare, 1987). The first known pinnipeds date to the latest Oligocene (Mitchell and Tedford, 1973; Barnes, 1979). Early members retain the dental features of their terrestrial carnivoran ancestors, namely well-defined carnassial teeth used to shear meat. Many later families have a modified dentition similar to that of the cetaceans; distal curving cusps, widely spaced cheek teeth, and similar molar and pre-molars. In some cases homodonty is present (Peyer, 1968; Hillson, 1986; Carroll, 1988). Elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) â€“ While the fossil record of sharks extends back into the Late Silurian, it was during the Late Devonian that a burst of evolutionary diversification occurred (Zangerl, 1981; Carroll, 1988). Paleozoic tooth forms are generally sharply pointed, with one or more cusps. This form of dentition provides an effective means for grasping and holding prey. During the later part of the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, neoselachian (modern sharks, rays, and skates) squaliform, lamniform, and carchariniform shark groups developed a highly effective jaw mechanism that allowed these sharks to gouge and wrench large pieces from prey. Additionally, many neoselachians evolved sharp, blade-like teeth, often with serrated edges, which served to slice deep into the flesh of large fish and marine mammals. This allowed for predation on prey larger than the sharks themselves and opened up new feeding niches (Moss, 1977; Capetta, 1987; Vermeij, 1987). While some groups of neoselachians developed formidable serrated blade-like teeth, other tooth morphologies also evolved, including teeth designed for tearing, clutching, and crushing. In general, neoselachian anterior teeth are sharper and narrower than the lateral teeth, upper teeth are relatively wide and slanted posteriorly, lower teeth are relatively narrow and straight (Moss, 1977; Capetta, 1987; Kent, 1994). General vertebrate tooth types â€“ Several schemes have been used to classify basic tooth designs in sharks (Peyer, 1968; Moss, 1977; Capetta, 1987; Kent, 1994), Mesozoic marine reptiles (Peyer, 1968; Massare, 1987, 1997), and marine mammals (Peyer, 1968; Hillson, 1986; Massare, 1987). Since this study involves all three vertebrate groups, a comprehensive classification scheme that accommodates each major tooth type was required. What follows is a hybrid tooth scheme based on the previous classifications referenced above (Figure 2). Clutching â€“ Teeth are generally small, with a low profile crown, typically surrounded by small cusplets. The enamaloid is frequently folded or ridged longitudinally, increasing the strength of the crown. Clutching dentition is used to restrain prey, as well as crush weakly armored prey. Crushing/Grinding â€“ Teeth generally have a high crown with a polygonal outline, or are robust with a bulging crown that is transversely streamlined. Typically individual teeth form a dental plate with a nearly planar surface, or functional rows. This form of dentition is used to fragment or smash open hard-shelled prey that typically inhabit benthic or near bottom settings. Grasp/Crush/Chop â€“ Teeth are usually conical and robust. Sometimes teeth bear fine longitudinal ridges. This type of dentition is used to puncture and restrain prey, as well as to smash and chop bones. Pierce/Gouge â€“ Teeth are smooth and pointed. Sometimes teeth are recurved. Teeth may be delicate and slender, or relatively robust. This dentition is used to pierce and grasp prey, or used to wrench out pieces of flesh. Slicing/Gouge â€“ Teeth are generally flattened labio-lingually or ellipsoid in cross-section. The crown may be serrated, or have cutting edges. Teeth function to slice and/or gouge the flesh of relatively large prey. MATERIALS AND METHODS Dental character data collected from Late Figure 1: Selected skulls and dentitions of Late Cretaceous marine reptiles and Cenozoic marine mammals. Clockwise from upper-left: Ichthyosaurus; Killer Whale; False Killer Whale; Pacific White Sided Dolphin; the plesiosaur Thalassomedon; the mosasaur Tylosaurus. Figure 2: Representative tooth types found among predatory marine vertebrates. Note that there are two types of Crushing/Grinding teeth. Type 1 teeth have a robust, semi-rounded dental crown, while type 2 teeth have a polygonal outline and a relatively high dental crown. The Sedimentary Record 6 | December 2005 Cretaceous marine reptiles, Cenozoic marine mammals, and Late Cretaceous Cenozoic elasmobranchs was were analyzed using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) because of the wide variety of tooth morphologies among marine vertebrate predators, morphological convergence and divergence. The eigenvectors generated from the analysis were used to construct a morphometric â€œtooth space.â€ Analysis revealed that semi-discrete regions of the tooth morphospace are occupied predominantly by single tooth types. Since tooth morphology can be reasonably correlated to diet, the semidiscrete regions of occupied tooth morphospace can be used as proxies for feeding guilds (Moss, 1977; Capetta, 1987; Massare, 1987, 1997; Taylor, 1987). Data Collection â€“ The analysis included 39 species of Late Cretaceous sharks, 20 species of Paleocene sharks, 40 species of Eocene and Oligocene sharks, 20 species of Late Cretaceous marine reptiles, and 29 species of Cenozoic marine mammals (which represents all major Cenozoic tooth types). While the number of species used in the analysis is large, it is not comprehensive. However, all major tooth types for each major group were included. The lack of homologous tooth morphology among the major groups analyzed required a combination of discrete as well as simple dimensional measurements. Dental characters utilized in the study included tooth length, width, cross-sectional outline, and longitudinal outline, the presence of serrations, number of lateral cusps, the presence of curvature and/or the presence of recurvature (Figure 3). Species included in the analysis were originally collected from Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic rocks located in the south-central, southeastern, and the mid-Atlantic United States, as well as Europe and the Pacific Rim. Specimens used in the study were obtained from the National Museum of Natural History and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Analysis of measurement data â€“ A correlational PCA was performed using the program PC-ORD (McCune and Mefford, 1999). All characters were included in the PCA analyses, as were all species included in the study. A morphometric toot",2005,
a New Risk Assessment Tool for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,"Introduction: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), can be curative for many hematologic disorders. However, HSCT is still associated with significant risks. HSCT outcomes are dependent on patient, disease and transplant related factors. There are a number of assessment tools being used to predict outcomes. Some use patient related variables such as the hematopoietic cell transplantation specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), some use disease-related variables such as the disease-risk index (DRI) and some others incorporate combined variables. We aimed to incorporate disease, patient comorbidities, donor, and transplant characteristics into one comprehensive prognostic model to predict 2 year disease-free survival (DFS). Methods: 273 consecutive patients (162 males, 111 females) receiving an initial HSCT from 2010 and 2016 were identified and retrospectively analyzed. Median age was 56 years (range 18-76 years) and a broad representation of hematologic disorders (119 AML, 46 ALL, 60 MDS, 18 NHL, 30 other) were included. All pts received peripheral blood as graft source. The majority received an unrelated donor transplant (166) and were conditioned with a myeloablative regimen (199). The dataset was randomly split in a 2:1 ratio to create training and testing dataset prior to data analysis. Variables under consideration as predictors of 2 year disease-free survival included: patient (age, sex, blood type, CMV status, Karnofsky Performance Status, HCT-CI), donor (age, sex, blood type, CMV status), disease (type, time since diagnosis, Disease Risk Index), and transplant (prep regimen, year of transplant, related/unrelated, match/mismatch) characteristics. Using the training dataset, a lasso penalized Cox regression was applied with the penalty parameter being derived as the mean of 1,000 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation. Patient risk scores was computed from the model and used to stratify patients based on a median split of risk scores; survival differences were evaluated using the log-rank test. Model performance was evaluated in the training and testing datasets by deriving time-dependent AUC curves, evaluating survival differences by risk strata, and comparing predicted to observed survival probabilities at 2 years. Results: Karnofsky Performance Status ( Conclusion: This comprehensive prognostic model is able to stratify patients into high risk and low risk groups with significantly different outcome. The inclusion of additional variables in the model increased accuracy (higher AUC) relative to existing models, which highlights the importance of taking into consideration additional constructs when trying to predict DFS. Further independent validation of our findings is necessary. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",2017,Blood
"Effectiveness of cell-free or cell-associated turkey herpesvirus vaccine against Marek's disease in chickens as influenced by maternal antibody, vaccine dose, and time of exposure to Marek's disease virus.","SUMMARY This study evaluated the protective ability of cell-free and cellassociated turkey herpesvirus (HVT) vaccine against Marek's disease (MD). Five variables were evaluated: cell-free versus cellassociated HVT, HVT-maternal antibody, dose of HVT, time of exposure to MDV, and comparison of MD challenge virus types. The results were highly suggestive that maternal antibody to HVT inhibited induction of viremia but also made the antibody response less uniform and delayed. The combined effect of HVTmaternal antibody on viremia and antibody development plus early exposure (1 week vs. 2 weeks) to MDV resulted in tumor development in chickens given a low dose of the HVT vaccine. Those results differed substantially from results obtained in birds without maternal antibody but vaccinated with the same doses of the HVT vaccine. One-day-old broiler chicks were vaccinated with cell-free or cell-associated HVT and challenged with various MD isolates designated as GA, EEF-1, BSF-1, BSF-2 and BSF-3. The EEF-1, BSF-1, and BSF-2 isolates of MD were obtained from farms with a high incidence of MD despite vaccination with the HVT vaccine. The BSF-3 isolate of MD was not as virulent as EEF-1, BSF-1, BSF-2, or GA. Chickens vaccinated with the cell-associated HVT",1978,Avian diseases
High dimensional sparse covariance estimation via directed acyclic graphs,"We present a graph-based technique for estimating sparse covariance matrices and their inverses from high-dimensional data. The method is based on learning a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and estimating parameters of a multivariate Gaussian distribution based on a DAG. For inferring the underlying DAG we use the PC-algorithm [27] and for estimating the DAG-based covariance matrix and its inverse, we use a Cholesky decomposition approach which provides a positive (semi-)definite sparse estimate. We present a consistency result in the high-dimensional framework and we compare our method with the Glasso [12, 8, 2] for simulated and real data.",2009,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Shrinkage Tuning Parameter Selection with a Diverging Number of Parameters,"Contemporary statistical research frequently deals with problems involving a diverging number of parameters. For those problems, various shrinkage methods (e.g. the lasso and smoothly clipped absolute deviation) are found to be particularly useful for variable selection. Nevertheless, the desirable performances of those shrinkage methods heavily hinge on an appropriate selection of the tuning parameters. With a fixed predictor dimension, Wang and co-worker have demonstrated that the tuning parameters selected by a Bayesian information criterion type criterion can identify the true model consistently. In this work, similar results are further extended to the situation with a diverging number of parameters for both unpenalized and penalized estimators. Consequently, our theoretical results further enlarge not only the scope of applicabilityation criterion type criteria but also that of those shrinkage estimation methods.

An efficient audiovisual saliency model to predict eye positions when looking at conversations,"Classic models of visual attention dramatically fail at predicting eye positions on visual scenes involving faces. While some recent models combine faces with low-level features, none of them consider sound as an input. Yet it is crucial in conversation or meeting scenes. In this paper, we describe and refine an audiovisual saliency model for conversation scenes. This model includes a speaker diarization algorithm which automatically modulates the saliency of conversation partners' faces and bodies according to their speaking-or-not status. To merge our different features into a master saliency map, we use an efficient statistical method (Lasso) allowing a straightforward interpretation of feature relevance. To train and evaluate our model, we run an eye tracking experiment on a publicly available meeting videobase.

Gaussian matrices, has been characterized. The analysis is based on a framework introduced by Stojnic and heavily relies on the use of Gordon's Gaussian min-max theorem (GMT), a comparison principle on Gaussian processes. As a result, corresponding characterizations for other ensembles of measurement matrices have not been developed. In this work, we analyze the corresponding performance of the ensemble of isotropically random orthogonal (i.r.o.) measurements. We consider the constrained version of the Generalized LASSO and derive a sharp characterization of its normalized squared error in the large-system limit. When compared to its Gaussian counterpart, our result analytically confirms the superiority in performance of the i.r.o. ensemble. Our second result, derives an asymptotic lower bound on the minimum conic singular values of i.r.o. matrices. This bound is larger than the corresponding bound on Gaussian matrices. To prove our results we express i.r.o. matrices in terms of Gaussians and show that, with some modifications, the GMT framework is still applicable.",2015,2015 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)
Structured fusion lasso penalized multi-state models.,"Multi-state models generalize survival or duration time analysis to the estimation of transition-specific hazard rate functions for multiple transitions. When each of the transition-specific risk functions is parametrized with several distinct covariate effect coefficients, this leads to a model of potentially high dimension. To decrease the parameter space dimensionality and to work out a clear image of the underlying multi-state model structure, one can either aim at setting some coefficients to zero or to make coefficients for the same covariate but two different transitions equal. The first issue can be approached by penalizing the absolute values of the covariate coefficients as in lasso regularization. If, instead, absolute differences between coefficients of the same covariate on different transitions are penalized, this leads to sparse competing risk relations within a multi-state model, that is, equality of covariate effect coefficients. In this paper, a new estimation approach providing sparse multi-state modelling by the aforementioned principles is established, based on the estimation of multi-state models and a simultaneous penalization of the L1 -norm of covariate coefficients and their differences in a structured way. The new multi-state modelling approach is illustrated on peritoneal dialysis study data and implemented in the R package penMSM. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2016,Statistics in medicine
"Middle Jurassic Sporopollen Assemblages from Tangqian-3 Well of the Santanghu Basin, Xinjiang","Abundant sporopollen of about 120 species referred to 52 genera and some acritarches (2 species of 2 genera and 1 indeterminate type) were disco vered from Tangqian 3 well of the Santanghu basin, Xinjiang. They are grouped into two assemblages namely Cyathidites minor Osmundacidites Cycadopites Quadraeculina assemblage, Kraeuse lisporites manasiensis Classopollis Quadraeculina as semblage. Based on the assemblages, the author considers the first assemblage to be early Middle Jurassic in age, and the second assemblage to be late Middle Jurassic. During early Middle Jurassic the climate was warm and wet in the Santanghu basin of Xinjiang, in a temperateâ€”subtropical zone. During late Middle Jurassic the climate was also warm, but became drier than early Middle Jurassic, in a subtropical zone.",2001,
"Biostratigraphic implications of Hedbergella sigali Moullade (foraminifera) and Ephedripites multicostatus Brenner (pollen): Evidence for Berriasian â€“ Turonian age for the Mfamosing Limestone and Ekenkpon Shale in the Calabar Flank, South Eastern Nigeria","Integrated biostratigraphic analysis was carried out on three shallow wells (A, B & C) drilled in the Calabar Flank, southeastern Nigeria, in order to determine the age of the study wells. Standard biostratigraphic sample preparation / separation and analytical approaches were applied on seventeen (17) core samples obtained from the study wells. Berriasian Turonian age was assigned to the recovered sediments based on the co-occurrences of Ephedripites multicostatus, Ephedripites jansonii, Classopollis spp, Classopollis classoides, Classopollis jardinel, Triorites africaensis, Cretaceiporites mulleri, Cretaceiporites polygonalis, Triffosapollenites rugosa, Triorites africaensis and Steevesipollenites binodosus (palynoflora) as well as the co-occurrences of Hedbergella sigali, Hedbergella delrioensis, Hedbergella crassa, Hedbergella planispira, Hedbergella sp., Hedbergella simplicissima, Heterohelix moremani, Heterohelix reussi, Heterohelix sp., Haplophragmoides sp., Ammotium cf nkalagum, Ammotium cf nwalium and Globigerinelloides caseyi (microfauna). The occurrence of Hedbergella sigali points to an age of Barremian â€“ Aptian and the foraminifera zone indicating this age is named after this foraminifera (Hedbergella sigali zone). Ephedripites multicostatus points to an age of Berriasian â€“ Velanginian (Neocomian), the pollen zone indicating this age is named after this palynomorph (Ephedripites multicostatus zone). The co-occurrence of some age diagnostic palynomorphs (Classopollis spp, Classopollis classoides, Classopollis jardinel, Triorites africaensis, Cretaceiporites mulleri, Triffosapollenites rugosa and Steevesipollenites binodosus) as well as some age diagnostic microfauna (Hedbergella crassa, Hedbergella planispira, Heterohelix moremani, Heterohelix reussi and Globigerinelloides caseyi) point to the Aptian â€“ Turonian age bracket. It was on this basis that the Hauterivian Turonian age was assigned to the Ekenkpon Shale and Berriasian â€“ Albian for the Mfamosing Limestone.",2018,
Online topology estimation for vector autoregressive processes in data networks,"An important problem in data sciences pertains to inferring causal interactions among a collection of time series. Upon modeling these as a vector autoregressive (VAR) process, this paper deals with estimating the model parameters to identify the underlying causality graph. To exploit the sparse connectivity of causality graphs, the proposed estimators minimize a group-Lasso regularized functional. To cope with real-time applications, big data setups, and possibly time-varying topologies, two online algorithms are presented to recover the sparse coefficients when observations are received sequentially. The proposed algorithms are inspired by the classic recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm and offer complementary benefits in terms of computational efficiency. Numerical results showcase the merits of the proposed schemes in both estimation and prediction tasks.",2017,2017 IEEE 7th International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)
Exploring Associations Between Postural Balance and Levels of Urinary Organophosphorus Pesticide Metabolites,"Objective: Apply a data-driven approach to explore associations between postural balance and pesticide exposure among Latino farmworkers and non-farmworkers. Methods: Lasso-regularized, generalized linear models were used to examine associations between postural control measures in four experimental conditions (2 visualâ€ŠÃ—â€Š2 cognitive difficulty) and dialkylphosphate (DAP) urinary metabolite levels. Results: Obtained models generally performed poorly at explaining postural control measures. However, when both visual and cognitive conditions were alteredâ€”the most challenging balance conditionâ€”models for some postural balance measures contained several DAP metabolites and had relatively better fits. Conclusions: The current results were equivocal regarding associations between postural control measures and DAP metabolite concentrations. However, farmworker status appears to be an important variable in understanding this association. Future work should use a posturally- and cognitively-challenging test condition to reveal any potential associations.",2018,Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine
"Necessity, Contingency, and the Future of Kant","Catherine Malabouâ€™s Before Tomorrow: Epigenesis and Rationality represents a new contribution to a series of books by critical theorists seeking to assess the relationship between Kantâ€™s thought and contemporary critical thinking. My review proceeds in three steps. First, I contextualize the book by contrasting its approach to that of its antecedents. Second, I reconstruct Malabouâ€™s central argument, according to which Kantâ€™s notion of an â€œepigenesis of reason,â€ as presented in the Critique of Pure Reason, can be read as a movement of self-appropriation and self-formation by reason, which becomes evident in the Critique of the Power of Judgment. I focus on how this reading leads to a polemic engagement with Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s critique of Kant, which, according to Malabou, is unable to provide a coherent account of the tension between necessity and contingency in the forms of thought. Third, I develop a critical assessment of both Meillasssouxâ€™s and Malabouâ€™s readings of Kant. By reconstructing Kantâ€™s own reformulations of the distinction between necessity and contingency throughout his theoretical and practical philosophy, I show that both theorists leave aside an essential tenet of his critical enterprise, namely, the detachment of the realm of freedom and action from the realm of cognition. Thus I conclude that, although Malabou is right in that the categories of necessity and contingency are subject to an open-ended transformation in the cognitive realm, the development of these categories in Kantâ€™s work is closely linked to his conception of action, which stems from the gap as well as the interrelation between theoretical and practical reason.",2016,Diacritics
Makt og maktsentre i vikingtid og middelalder : maktsentre pÃ¥ Ã˜stlandet fra ca. 800 til 1200 e. Kr. i Snorre og arkeologiske kilder,"Dette er en undersokelse av makt, maktsentre og maktstrukturer pa Ostlandet i Norge i vikingtid og tidlig middelalder fra ca 800 til ca 1200 e. Kr.. Det blir undersokt hva slags makt, maktsentre og maktstrukturer som fantes pa Ostlandet i disse periodene og hvordan disse utviklet seg gjennom vikingtid og utover i middelalderen. Emnet undersokes ved ved hjelp av bade skriftlige kilder, hovedsakelig i form av Snorre Sturlassons Heimskringla, og arkeologiske kilder. Ostfold og Vestfold med sine maktsentre ble valgt ut som de to regionene som undersokes i dybden, mens de andre regionene pa Ostlandet (Bahuslen, Opplandene og Telemark) hovedsakelig brukes til sammenligning. Alle regionene er likevel representert i de fyldige vedleggene der benevnelser med og fra hver enkelt region er trukket ut fra Snorre. 

I kapitlet som tar for seg maktsentrene i Ostfold i vikingtid og middelalder belyses dette altsa bade gjennom Snorre og de arkeologiske kildene fra fylket (Ostfold som del av det storre Vingulmork blir ogsa omtalt her). Forst blir Snorres fortellinger fra navaerende Ostfold gjennomgatt og diskutert og de maktsentrene som fortelles om her blir trukket fram. Deretter er det maktsenteret Alvheim som star i fokus, som vikingtidens maktsenter i Ostfold (egentlig for hele Vingulmork). Her vil ogsa de arkeologiske kildene trekkes inn for a belyse Alvheim som maktsenter. Deretter tar kapitlet for seg maktsenteret som tok over for Alvheim i middelalderen, nemlig byen Borg, eller da dagens Sarpsborg. 

Etter a ha gjennomgatt hva Snorre og arkeologiske kilder forteller om maktsentre, storgarder og stormenn i Ostfold gjores det samme med Vestfold. Forst en gjennomgang av Snorres omtale av Vestfold for sa a ga igjennom vikingtidens maktsentre fra dette fylket, henholdsvis Skiringssal (Kaupang), Holtan med Borre, Geirstad med Gokstad, kongsgarden Tunsberg (forloper til byen Tonsberg) og kongsgarden Sem. Deretter er det middelalderens maktsentre som blir belyst, spesielt det som na har blitt byen Tonsberg, samt Linnestad og Ramnes. Til slutt vil hovdingmakten og kongemakten pa Ostlandet analyseres naermere ved at maktsentrene blir satt inn i en storre samfunnsmessig og historisk kontekst. Eksemplene fra Ostlandet vil hovedsakelig utgjores av de undersokte maktsentrene fra Ostfold og Vestfold i vikingtid og middelalder, men ogsa de andre Ostlandsregionene vil vaere med for a belyse maktsentrene pa Ostlandet i denne konteksten. Analysen vil vise utviklingen av maktsentrene og hovdinggardene i regionen og deres utvikling gjennom vikingtid og inn i middelalder. Undersokelsen viser hvordan Norge, herunder Ostlandet, gikk fra a vaere et hovdingdommesamfunn med flere maktsentre dominert av hovdinger og smakonger til a bli et kristent europeisk kongedomme der byene utgjorde de nye maktsentrene.%%%%This thesis is examining power, centres of power and powerstructures in the regions of eastern Norway in the viking age and the early middle ages.

The AKRON-Kalman filter for tracking time-varying networks,"We propose the AKRON-Kalman filter for the problem of inferring sparse dynamic networks from a noisy undersampled set of measurements. Unlike the Lasso-Kalman filter, which uses regularization with the l1-norm to find an approximate sparse solution, the AKRON-Kalman tracker uses the l1 approximation to find the location of a â€œsufficient numberâ€ of zero entries that guarantees the existence of the optimal sparsest solution. This sufficient number of zeros can be shown to be exactly equal to the dimension of the kernel of an under-determined system. The AKRON-Kalman tracker then iteratively refines this solution of the l1 problem by ensuring that the observed reconstruction error does not exceed the measurement noise level. The AKRON solution is sparser, by construction, than the Lasso solution while the Kalman tracking ensures that all past observations are taken into account to estimate the network in any given stage. The AKRON-Kalman tracker is applied to the inference of the time-varying wing-muscle genetic regulatory network of the Drosophila Melanogaster (fruit fly) during the embryonic, larval, pupal and adulthood phases. Unlike all previous approaches, the proposed AKRON-Kalman was able to recover all reportedly known interactions in the Flybase dataset.",2017,2017 IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical & Health Informatics (BHI)
Learning Higher-Order Graph Structure with Features by Structure Penalty,"In discrete undirected graphical models, the conditional independence of node labels Y is specified by the graph structure. We study the case where there is another input random vector X (e.g. observed features) such that the distribution P(Y | X) is determined by functions of X that characterize the (higher-order) interactions among the Y's. The main contribution of this paper is to learn the graph structure and the functions conditioned on X at the same time. We prove that discrete undirected graphical models with feature X are equivalent to multivariate discrete models. The reparameterization of the potential functions in graphical models by conditional log odds ratios of the latter offers advantages in representation of the conditional independence structure. The functional spaces can be flexibly determined by kernels. Additionally, we impose a Structure Lasso (SLasso) penalty on groups of functions to learn the graph structure. These groups with overlaps are designed to enforce hierarchical function selection. In this way, we are able to shrink higher order interactions to obtain a sparse graph structure.",2011,

Interconnections at the microbial and societal scales: The response of hypersaline microbial communities to environmental perturbations and a situated exercise in the democratization of science,"Author(s): Andrade, Karen | Advisor(s): Banfield, Jillian F; Iles, Alastair T | Abstract: AbstractInterconnections at the microbial and societal scales: The response of hypersaline microbial communities to environmental perturbations and a situated exercise in the democratization of sciencebyKaren AndradeDoctor of Philosophy in Environmental Science, Policy, and ManagementUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Jillian F. Banfield, Co-ChairProfessor Alastair T. Iles, Co-ChairRegardless of the scale at which it is defined, at the core of a community is the interdependence and connection of organisms. It is from the connections between organisms that a community emerges. This interdisciplinary dissertation is an investigation of, and an engagement with, both microbial and human communities from the point of view of several disciplines and methods. Microorganisms and humans both exist in and form close communities with each other. The methods and theoretical frameworks used in each chapter vary widely, providing different lenses through which to understand these communities and their networks of interactions. Furthermore, in all chapters the results of community-wide approaches highlight the phenomena that emerge from the interconnections within, and with the environmental context in which the community exists. The first part of this dissertation analyzes the ecology, function and response of the microbial community of a hypersaline lake. Lake Tyrell (NW, Victoria, Australia) is a thalassohaline lake whose microbial community we propose is a model for understanding the response of microbes and their communities to short time scale environmental perturbations. Cultivation-independent methods were used to study the dynamics and metabolic profile of the planktonic microbial community. Cultivation-independent methods allow the study of the whole community, including organisms that cannot be grown in the laboratory. In chapter 1 metagenomics, lipidomics and microscopy methods demonstrated the operation of a strong community-level diel (day-night) cycle, likely driven by the interconnection of nutrient fluxes, temperature, light abundance and oxygen concentrations. Lipidomic and statistical analyses demonstrated striking and significant shifts in the proportions of bacterial and archaeal lipids across the diel cycle in a 3-day and 2-night time series experiment. Bacterial lipids increase during the day and decrease during the night and archaeal lipids show the opposite trend. Metagenomic analysis revealed the day-night behavior of specific types of organisms and resolved community composition. The community includes two bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes, eight archaea members of the Halobacteriaceae family and six different nanohaloarchaeal types, three of which have not been identified previously. Metagenomic analyses support the finding of an overall preference in Archaea for nighttime, relative to Bacteria, which increase during the daytime. The nanohaloarchaea showed a particularly strong diel cycle, with a pronounced increase in relative abundance over the night periods The Nanohaloarchea are nano-sized archaea that were first identified at Lake Tyrrell by previous studies. They are part of a recently described group of archaea that tend to have small genomes (~1.2Mb) and cell size (~l500 nm in diameter). The combining of multi-â€˜omic methods and microscopy allowed the detection of a diel cycle in relative abundances of bacteria and archaea, resolved the behavior of the Nanohaloarchaea, which opened a window into their ecology and possible associations with other organisms in the community.Chapter 2 further investigated the ecology of Lake Tyrrellâ€™s microbial community during the 3-day and 2-night time series experiment mentioned above. Metagenomic and metaproteomic methods allowed the study of how the communityâ€™s function is impacted by evaporative concentration as it is modulated by variations in temperature and solar radiation during the diel cycle. An in-depth characterization of the physiological changes of Haloquadratum, the dominant organisms in the lake, showed increased expression of proteins involved in stress response, cell division, and the biosynthesis of vitamin B cofactors. The expression of proteins that biosynthesize vitamin B12 adds to recent findings that underlie the importance of B vitamins in natural environments. Metaproteomics showed that evaporative concentration was a major driver of shifts in the Haloquadratum proteome and that a physiological diel cycle might be suppressed as environmental stress increases. Analysis of nanohaloarchaeal genomes suggests that they are anaerobic fermenters that overall have limited metabolic capacity. Given that they lack many core biosynthetic pathways, they likely depend on abundant archaea such as Haloquadratum for many basic metabolic substrates, possibly including membrane lipids as well as nucleotides and amino acids. . Results provide new insight into the response of hypersaline microbial communities to the interrelated environmental factors that track the diel cycle, including evaporative concentration.Chapter 3 is an interdisciplinary essay that brings microbial ecology into conversation with Science and Technology studies. Partly ethnography of science, I discuss the recent technological changes that have taken place in the field of microbiology. Further I highlight their contribution to a shifting perception of microbes as individual threats to a view that emphasizes our co-dependence and collaboration with microbial communities. By shedding light on the complex and mutually affecting dynamics that characterize the relationship between human cells and their microbial counterparts, microbiology is pointing to a new vision of the human body; a hybrid entity that has been shaped by microbial relationships and co-evolutions. Yet, the epistemic culture of microbiology remains stable and dependent a disconnected and disembodied objectivity that reinforces the view of microbes as passive, mechanical objects primed for exploitation. Yet, â€œindigenous microbiologyâ€ practices, such as composting and artisanal cheese making, show how humans and microbes have built collaborative relationships outside of the body. Underscoring the communal nature of microbes and humans provides an opportunity for the epistemic culture of microbiology to shift by underscoring the communal nature of microbes and humans, and moving away from reductionism.Working at another scale and resulting from questions rising from my experience as a microbiologist, graduate student and academic scientist, Chapter 4 narrates the results of my efforts to establish a Science Shop at UC Berkeley. Science Shops are organizations that coordinate and execute community-engaged research projects. Community-engaged research has been shown to better the scientific enterprise by improving its methodological rigor as well as its public relevance and policy reach. By bringing together university researchers, students, and community organizations science shops facilitate scientific research that responds to the needs and interests of all stakeholders. It is imperative that universities explore and actualize models of knowledge production that empower the communities that support them. Inspired by the co-learning and co-productive relationships between learners and teachers and by the results of the European Science Shop movement, the UC Berkeley Science Shop was established in 2013 and was successfully funded and run for two years. Grounded in the theoretical frameworks of situated knowledge, local and generalized knowledges and epistemic injustice, I proposed that Science Shops have an important role in democratizing the practice of, and access to, scientific research and knowledge production. The UC Berkeley Science Shop itself, and the three pilot projects completed provide a precedent and a model for the creation of these types of organizations in American universities.",2015,
Robust immunoscore model to predict the response to anti-PD1 therapy in melanoma,"This study aimed to construct immune-related predictors to identify responders to anti-PD1 therapy of melanoma through CIBERSORT algorithm. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression, we constructed an immunoscore consisting of 8 immune subsets to predict the anti-PD1 response. This score achieved an overall accuracy of AUC = 0.77, 0.80 and 0.73 in the training cohort, validation cohort and on-anti-PD1 cohort, respectively. Patients with high immunoscores had significantly higher objective response rates (ORRs) than did those with low immunoscores (ORR: 53.8% vs 17.7%, P < 0.001 for entire pre-anti-PD1 cohort; 42.1% vs 15.1%, P = 0.022 for on-anti-PD1 cohort; 66.7% vs 16.7%, P = 0.038 for neoadjuvant anti-PD1 cohort). Prolonged survival trends were observed in high-immunoscore group (1-year PFS: 42.4% vs 14.3%, P = 0.059; 3-year OS: 41.5% vs 31.6%, P = 0.057). Furthermore, we found that high-immunoscore group exhibited higher fractions of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and an increased IFN-Î³ response. Analysis of the results of the GSEA indicated a significant enrichment of antitumor immunity pathways in the high-immunoscore group. Therefore, this study indicated that we constructed a robust immunoscore model to predict the anti-PD1 response of metastatic melanoma and the neoadjuvant anti-PD1 response of resectable melanoma.",2019,Aging (Albany NY)
Modifications of Unsupervised Neural Networks for Single Trial P 300 Detection,"P300 brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been gaining attention in recent years. To achieve good performance and accuracy, it is necessary to optimize both feature extraction and classification algorithms. This article aims at verifying whether supervised learning models based on self-organizing maps (SOM) or adaptive resonance theory (ART) can be useful for this task. For feature extraction, the state-of-the-art Windowed means paradigm was used. For classification, proposed classifiers were compared with state-of-the-art classifiers used in BCI research, such as Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis, or shrinkage LDA. Publicly available datasets from fifteen healthy subjects were used for the experiments. The results indicated that SOM-based models yield better results than ART-based models. The best performance was achieved by the LASSO model that was comparable to state-of-the-art BCI classifiers. Further possibilities for improvements are discussed.",2018,
SAT0047â€…Predicting maintenance of response based on disease characteristics and early clinical response in rheumatoid arthritis patients upon withdrawal of adalimumab,"Background Some patients (pts) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) achieve low disease activity (LDA) after treatment with adalimumab (ADA) plus methotrexate (MTX) and can maintain LDA after ADA withdrawal1. However, others experience a flare in disease activity. The factors associated with loss or maintenance of response are not understood. Objectives To identify pt disease characteristics and early clinical responses, which predict maintenance of LDA upon ADA withdrawal in individual RA pts. Methods Data from the OPTIMA trial were used in this post hoc analysis. In period 1 (P1), pts were treated for 26 weeks (wks) with ADA+MTX or placebo (PBO) +MTX. Pts on ADA+MTX who achieved DAS28-CRP <3.2 at wks 22 and 26 (responders) were randomized to ADA withdrawal, or ADA+MTX continuation up to Wk 78. Responders to PBO+MTX in P1 continued on PBO+MTX up to Wk 78 (PBO continuation). Data from the ADA withdrawal arm were used to predict LDA at Wk 78 by DAS28-CRP (â©½3.2) or SDAI (â©½11). Potential factors including baseline (BL) disease characteristics and Wk 26 responses, including DAS28-CRP, SDAI, ACR score components, modified total sharp score (mTSS) and joint space narrowing score (JSN), were screened by the LASSO method2, which performs variable selection by penalizing unduly complicated models, with/without incorporating the speed of DAS28-CRP or SDAI response as an individual predictor. Logistic regression on the LASSO-selected factors yielded coefficients used to derive individual scoring equations and prediction scores for Wk 78 outcomes (fig footnote). Prediction score cutoffs were established by the regression tree method3. The results were validated in data from the PBO continuation arm. Results For the prediction of DAS28-CRP LDA at Wk 78, BL physician global assessment (PhGA) and health-assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI), and Wk 26 DAS28-CRP, HAQ-DI, JSN and CRP were selected by LASSO, and used to calculate the prediction score. Including speed of response did not affect the predictors chosen. Out of 9 pts predicted not to have DAS28-CRP LDA at Wk 78, 0 had LDA (NPV=100%) (fig 1). Out of 66 pts predicted to have DAS28-CRP LDA at Wk 78, 63 predictions were correct (PPV=96.5%). Results were comparable for most cutoff categories in the validation arm (PPV=82%); however, no pts were predicted to have a non-response at Wk 78. For the prediction of SDAI LDA at Wk 78, the NPV was 86% (1/7 predictions incorrect); PPV was 95% (39/41 predictions correct); in the validation arm, the PPV was 82%. Figure. No caption available. Conclusions DAS28-CRP LDA at 78 wks could be individually predicted for up to 63% pts in OPTIMA who withdrew ADA/continued PBO+MTX with 96.5% accuracy, based on demographics and clinical outcomes at 6 months. This instrument could help identify pts who may be able to maintain LDA upon ADA withdrawal. ReferencesSmolen et al, 2013. Lancet;383.Tibshirani, R, 1996.

Bayesian adaptive Lasso,"We propose the Bayesian adaptive Lasso (BaLasso) for variable selection and coefficient estimation in linear regression. The BaLasso is adaptive to the signal level by adopting different shrinkage for different coefficients. Furthermore, we provide a model selection machinery for the BaLasso by assessing the posterior conditional mode estimates, motivated by the hierarchical Bayesian interpretation of the Lasso. Our formulation also permits prediction using a model averaging strategy. We discuss other variants of this new approach and provide a unified framework for variable selection using flexible penalties. Empirical evidence of the attractiveness of the method is demonstrated via extensive simulation studies and data analysis.",2010,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
Factor VII Activating Protease (FSAP): A Novel Protease in Hemostasis,"Abstract Recently a novel serine protease in human plasma was described and was named PHBP, PHBSP or factor seven activating protease (FSAP), respectively, the latter according to the finding that it can support coagulation by factor VII activation. Later on FSAP was identified as a potent activator of single chain plasminogen activators, in particular of prourokinase, as well. The physiological role of FSAP is still speculative, but recent studies suggest a contribution to hemostasis. Due to its affinity to glycosaminoglycans a role in cellassociated or extracellular proteolytic events is also likely. The impact of a very recently uncovered frequent polymorphism impairing the prourokinase activation potential of FSAP needs to be investigated in more detail.",2002,
Probabilistic Spectral Dimensionality Reduction,We introduce a new perspective on spectral dimensionality reduction which views these methods as Gaussian random fields (GRFs). Our unifying perspective is based on the maximum entropy principle which is in turn inspired by maximum variance unfolding. The resulting probabilistic models are based on GRFs. The resulting model is a nonlinear generalization of principal component analysis. We show that parameter fitting in the locally linear embedding is approximate maximum likelihood in these models. We develop new algorithms that directly maximize the likelihood and show that these new algorithms are competitive with the leading spectral approaches on a robot navigation visualization and a human motion capture data set. Finally the maximum likelihood perspective allows us to introduce a new approach to dimensionality reduction based on L1 regularization of the GRF via the graphical lasso.,2010,
Estimation and Forecasting of Large Realized Covariance Matrices and Portfolio Choice,"In this paper we consider modeling and forecasting of large realized covariance matrices by penalized vector autoregressive models. We propose using Lasso-type estimators to reduce the dimensionality to a manageable one and provide strong theoretical performance guarantees on the forecast capability of our procedure. To be precise, we show that we can forecast future realized covariance matrices almost as precisely as if we had known the true driving dynamics of these in advance. We next investigate the sources of these driving dynamics for the realized covariance matrices of the 30 Dow Jones stocks and find that these dynamics are not stable as the data is aggregated from the daily to the weekly and monthly frequency. The theoretical performance guarantees on our forecasts are illustrated on the Dow Jones index. In particular, we can beat our benchmark by a wide margin at the longer forecast horizons. Finally, we investigate the economic value of our forecasts in a portfolio selection exercise and find that in certain cases an investor is willing to pay a considerable amount in order get access to our forecasts.",2014,
Latitudinal variation in the microbiome of the sponge Ircinia campana correlates with host haplotype but not anti-predatory chemical defense,"Many marine sponges host diverse symbiotic microbial communities that have been implicated in the production of secondary metabolites. These metabolites may defend the host sponge from potential predators. Variability in symbiont communities across the range of the host sponge could alter levels of chemical defense. To investigate the relationship between symbiont composition and chemical defense, the microbiomes and palatability of tissue samples from Ircinia campana were characterized from 5 sites along a latitudinal gradient spanning temperate (South Atlantic Bight, SAB) and tropical (Caribbean) regions. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and Illumina sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes revealed that I. campana from different locations contained significantly distinct microbiomes and exhibited a consistent relationship of lower symbiont similarity over greater geographic distance (i.e. distancedecay). However, crude organic extracts of all samples of I. campana were unpalatable to assay fish Thalassoma bifasciatum in laboratory assays, indicating no difference in chemical defense across locations. Distinct haplotypes of I. campana were detected in populations from the SAB and Caribbean, correlating with the observed patterns of latitudinal variation in microbial symbiont communities. Our findings indicate that I. campana is chemically defended from fish predators across the range of the species and that latitudinal variation occurs in the microbiome of I. campana, driven by a combination of host-specific factors and region-specific environmental filtering of symbiont communities.",2017,Marine Ecology Progress Series

Multi-structural databases,"We introduce the Multi-Structural Database, a new dataframework to support efficient analysis of large, complex datasets. An instance of the model consists of a set of data objects,together with a schema that specifies segmentations of the set ofdata objects according to multiple distinct criteria (e.g., into ataxonomy based on a hierarchical attribute). Within this model, wedevelop a rich set of analytical operations and design highlyefficient algorithms for these operations. Our operations areformulated as optimization problems, and allow the user to analyzethe underlying data in terms of the allowed segmentations.
Our algorithms and results extend those of Fagin et al. [8] whostudied composition of mappings given by several kinds ofconstraints. In particular, they proved that full source-to-targettuple-generating dependencies (tgds) are closed under composition,but embedded source-to-target tgds are not. They introduced a classof second-order constraints, <i>SO tgds</i>, that isclosed under composition and has desirable properties for dataexchange.
We study constraints that need not be source-to-target and weconcentrate on obtaining (first-order) embedded dependencies. Aspart of this study, we also consider full dependencies andsecond-order constraints that arise from Skolemizing embeddeddependencies. For each of the three classes of mappings that westudy, we provide (a) an algorithm that attempts to compute thecomposition and (b) sufficient conditions on the input mappingsthat guarantee that the algorithm will succeed.
In addition, we give several negative results. In particular, weshow that full dependencies are not closed under composition, andthat second-order dependencies that are not limited to besource-to-target are not closed under restricted composition.Furthermore, we show that determining whether the composition canbe given by these kinds of dependencies is undecidable.",2005,
Diet of invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles) in Bermuda,"As a generalist and opportunistic predator, lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles) consume large quantities of juvenile reef fish and invertebrates, as well as the adults of small-bodied species. To better understand the impacts of these fishes upon invaded coral reef ecosystems, we describe the feeding habits of invasive lionfish in Bermuda based on stomach contents analysis, and the influence that environmental factors have on their diet via spatial and temporal changes in prey availability. Relative to other regions throughout the northwestern Atlantic, lionfish in Bermuda consume a greater proportion of crustaceans, and their diet appears to rely upon the relative abundance of available prey species. A poorly -known crustacean, the red night shrimp Cinetorhynchus rigens, is the species of greatest importance to the diet of Bermuda lionfish. Currently, herbivorous fishes do not make a major contribution to their diet, although the lionfish frequently target both ecologically (e.g. bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum) and economically important species (e.g. Atlantic creolefish Paranthias furcifer).",2016,Marine Ecology Progress Series
Coordinate Descent with Online Adaptation of Coordinate Frequencies,"Coordinate descent (CD) algorithms have become the method of choice for solving a number of optimization problems in machine learning. They are particularly popular for training linear models, including linear support vector machine classification, LASSO regression, and logistic regression. 
We consider general CD with non-uniform selection of coordinates. Instead of fixing selection frequencies beforehand we propose an online adaptation mechanism for this important parameter, called the adaptive coordinate frequencies (ACF) method. This mechanism removes the need to estimate optimal coordinate frequencies beforehand, and it automatically reacts to changing requirements during an optimization run. 
We demonstrate the usefulness of our ACF-CD approach for a variety of optimization problems arising in machine learning contexts. Our algorithm offers significant speed-ups over state-of-the-art training methods.",2014,ArXiv
Die Macht der Interpretation,"Abstract The article treats the problem of interpretation in its respect to reality by example of Umberto Ecoâ€™s moderate â€šrealisticâ€˜ position and his criticism of Friedrich Nietzsche, the â€œfatherâ€ of postmodernism. Here the strongest arguments on both sides are evaluated: Ecoâ€™s â€œnegative realismâ€ pointing out the impossibility of some interpretations and Nietzscheâ€™s thinking out the absolute absence of a privileged position proceeding from which it would be possible to unequivocally identify what is real. The article argues that the crucial point why some interpretations may prove to be stronger or weaker is best described in terms of the concept of power. One however should avoid misconceptions, since power itself is interpretation which nevertheless allows for the gradation of reality, the mobility of its horizons, their shifting and even their potential availability. A much-disputed question of prehistoric times as well as that of death as a limit of interpretability is inter alia included in the analysis. Both classical anti-realistic positions, such as that of Wittgenstein, and the argumentation of contemporary advocates of realism, such as Quentin Meillassoux, are taken into consideration.",2019,Deutsche Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Philosophie
Risk-consistency of cross-validation with lasso-type procedures,"The lasso and related sparsity inducing algorithms have been the target of substantial theoretical and applied research. Correspondingly, many results are known about their behavior for a fixed or optimally chosen tuning parameter specified up to unknown constants. In practice, however, this oracle tuning parameter is inaccessible so one must use the data to select one. Common statistical practice is to use a variant of cross-validation for this task. However, little is known about the theoretical properties of the resulting predictions with such data-dependent methods. We consider the high-dimensional setting with random design wherein the number of predictors $p$ grows with the number of observations $n$. Under typical assumptions on the data generating process, similar to those in the literature, we recover oracle rates up to a log factor when choosing the tuning parameter with cross-validation. Under weaker conditions, when the true model is not necessarily linear, we show that the lasso remains risk consistent relative to its linear oracle. We also generalize these results to the group lasso and square-root lasso and investigate the predictive and model selection performance of cross-validation via simulation.",2013,arXiv: Statistics Theory
"The Ore-forming Age and Palaeoenvironment of the Mengyejing Formation in Jiangcheng, Yunnan Province","Research on the potash metallogenic epoch in the Mengyejing Formation is of important significance for the analysis of the corresponding relationships of the salt-bearing strata between Lanping-Simao Basin in Yunnan,Sakhon Nakhon Basin in Laos,and Khorat Basin in Thailand,and is also helpful to the prospecting for potassium deposits in Yunnan.However,there has long been controversial concerning the chronostratigraphy of this formation.Based on pollen analysis of samples collected from the Jiangcheng mining area,the authors defined the main sporopollen assemblage as Psophophaera-Exesipollenites-Classopollis assemblage,with the discovery of the index angiosperms pollen fossils like Monocolpopollenites and Tricopite,indicating an arid tropical and subtropical climate.Thus,the age of sporopollen assemblage in Mengyejing Formation should be between Aptian and Albian of late Early Cretaceous.",2013,
Machine Learning Based Classification of Deep Brain Stimulation Outcomes in a Rat Model of Binge Eating Using Ventral Striatal Oscillations,"Neuromodulation-based interventions continue to be evaluated across an array of appetitive disorders but broader implementation of these approaches remains limited due to variable treatment outcomes. We hypothesize that individual variation in treatment outcomes may be linked to differences in the networks underlying these disorders. Here, Sprague-Dawley rats received deep brain stimulation separately within each nucleus accumbens (NAc) sub-region (core and shell) using a within-animal crossover design in a rat model of binge eating. Significant reductions in binge size were observed with stimulation of either target but with significant variation in effectiveness across individuals. When features of local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the NAc were used as predictors of the pre-defined stimulation outcomes (response or non-response) from each rat using a machine-learning approach (lasso), stimulation outcomes could be predicted with greater accuracy than expected by chance (effect sizes: core = 1.13, shell = 1.05). Further, these LFP features could be used to identify the best stimulation target for each animal (core vs. shell) with an effect size = 0.96. These data suggest that individual differences in underlying network activity may contribute to the variable outcomes of circuit based interventions and that measures of network activity have the potential to individually guide the selection of an optimal stimulation target and improve overall treatment response rates.",2018,Frontiers in Psychiatry
"On folding of entangled proteins: knots, lassos, links and Î¸-curves.","Around 6% of protein structures deposited in the PDB are entangled, forming knots, slipknots, lassos, links, and Î¸-curves. In each of these cases, the protein backbone weaves through itself in a complex way, and at some point passes through a closed loop, formed by other regions of the protein structure. Such a passing can be interpreted as crossing a topological barrier. How proteins overcome such barriers, and therefore different degrees of frustration, challenged scientists and has shed new light on the field of protein folding. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the free energy landscape of proteins with non-trivial topology. We describe identified mechanisms which lead proteins to self-tying. We discuss the influence of excluded volume, such as crowding and chaperones, on tying, based on available data. We briefly discuss the diversity of topological complexity of proteins and their evolution. We also list available tools to investigate non-trivial topology. Finally, we formulate intriguing and challenging questions at the boundary of biophysics, bioinformatics, biology, and mathematics, which arise from the discovery of entangled proteins.",2020,Current opinion in structural biology

Identifying latent grouped patterns in panel data models with interactive fixed effects,"Abstract We consider the estimation of latent grouped patterns in dynamic panel data models with interactive fixed effects. We assume that the individual slope coefficients are homogeneous within a group and heterogeneous across groups but each individualâ€™s group membership is unknown to the researcher. We consider penalized principal component (PPC) estimation by extending the penalized-profile-likelihood-based C-Lasso of Su, Shi, and Phillips (2016) to panel data models with cross section dependence. Given the correct number of groups, we show that the C-Lasso can achieve simultaneous classification and estimation in a single step and exhibit the desirable property of uniform classification consistency. The C-Lasso-based PPC estimators of the group-specific parameters also have the oracle property. BIC-type information criteria are proposed to choose the numbers of factors and groups consistently and to select the data-driven tuning parameter. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method. We apply our C-Lasso to study the persistence of housing prices in Chinaâ€™s large and medium-sized cities in the last decade and identify three groups.",2018,Journal of Econometrics
Machine learning approaches for predicting disposition of asthma and COPD exacerbations in the ED,"Objective The prediction of emergency department (ED) disposition at triage remains challenging. Machine learning approaches may enhance prediction. We compared the performance of several machine learning approaches for predicting two clinical outcomes (critical care and hospitalization) among ED patients with asthma or COPD exacerbation. Methods Using the 2007â€“2015 National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) ED data, we identified adults with asthma or COPD exacerbation. In the training set (70% random sample), using routinelyâ€available triage data as predictors (e.g., demographics, arrival mode, vital signs, chief complaint, comorbidities), we derived four machine learningâ€based models: Lasso regression, random forest, boosting, and deep neural network. In the test set (the remaining 30% of sample), we compared their prediction ability against traditional logistic regression with Emergency Severity Index (ESI, reference model). Results Of 3206 eligible ED visits, corresponding to weighted estimates of 13.9 million visits, 4% had critical care outcome and 26% had hospitalization outcome. For the critical care prediction, the best performing approachâ€“ boosting â€“ achieved the highest discriminative ability (Câ€statistics 0.80 vs. 0.68), reclassification improvement (net reclassification improvement [NRI] 53%, P = 0.002), and sensitivity (0.79 vs. 0.53) over the reference model. For the hospitalization prediction, random forest provided the highest discriminative ability (Câ€statistics 0.83 vs. 0.64) reclassification improvement (NRI 92%, P < 0.001), and sensitivity (0.75 vs. 0.33). Results were generally consistent across the asthma and COPD subgroups. Conclusions Based on nationallyâ€representative ED data, machine learning approaches improved the ability to predict disposition of patients with asthma or COPD exacerbation.",2018,American Journal of Emergency Medicine
tert-Butylhydroquinone protects dopaminergic neurons from MPP+ cytotoxicity primarily via normalization of glutathione levels in midbrain slice cultures,"s / Neuroscience Research 68S (2010) e223â€“e334 e305 own. We previouy reported that two types of AICD were existed. One was soluble and easily degraded form, and the other was membrane associated form. Therfore, we speculate that the accumulation of membrane associated AICD including APP C-terminal fragments may be toxic. In this study, to clear the relationship between the accumulation of AICD and toxic effects, we analzed the metabolism of AICD and the affect of AICD accumulation in cultured cells using proteomic methods. We found that APP C-terminal fragments was degraded in both gamma-secretase pathway and lysosomal pathway. On the proteomic analysis of cultured cells expressing AICDs or cultured cells with gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment, we found that nuclear-related proteins and vesicular trafficking-related proteins reduced in cultured cells expressing membrane-asscociated AICD. We will report and discuss the influence of AICDs accumulation in cultured cells. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1352 P2-n12 Generation of disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells from Alzheimerâ€™s disease patients Naoki Yahata 1 , Harushisa Inoue 1,2, Shiho Kitaoka 1,2, Kayoko Tsukita 1,2, Takayuki Kondo 3, Naohiro Egawa 1,3, Isao Asaka 1,2, Kazutoshi Takahashi 1,2, Tatsutoshi Nakahata 1, Shinobu Kawakatsu 4, Ryosuke Takahashi 3, Takashi Asada 2,5, Shinya Yamanaka 1 1 CiRA, iCeMS, Kyoto University 2 JST-CREST 3 Graduate School of Med., Kyoto University 4 Department of Psychiatry, Yamagata University School of Medicine 5 Department of Neuropsychiatry, University of Tsukuba Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system which causes progressive memory and cognitive decline during middle to late adult life. The cell death mechanisms and therapeutic intervention for AD have been tested by transgenic rodent models. However, these models not fully represent the human condition. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which show striking similarities to embryonic stem cells, can now be derived from human adult somatic tissues and have the capacity to be lineage restricted into various neuronal subtypes. Furthermore, establishment of disease-specific human cortical neurons and human cell-based AD model in vitro is crucial for investigation of the disease mechanism and drug discovery. We generated disease-specific iPS cells from patients with AD. Dermal fibroblasts from the patients were transduced with either four or three reprogramming factors, followed by emergence of putative iPS cell colonies after a few weeks. We evaluated their similarity to ES cells by checking the expression of the ES cellassociated antigens. Next, we examined the pluripotency of iPS cells by teratoma formation and embryoid body (EB) differentiation in vitro. Disease-specific iPS cells from AD patients possess properties of ES cells with patient-specific genetic information and may contribute to explore the pathogenesis of AD. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1353 P2-n13 Microarray profiling of gene expression in the aging monkey brain Sayuri Higaki 1 , Akira Sato 2, Toshio Kojima 2,3, Takao Oishi 1 1 Sect Systems Neurosci, Primate Res Inst, Kyoto Univ, Inuyama 2 Computational Systems Biol Res Group, RIKEN, Yokohama 3 Res Equipment Center, Hamamatsu Univ Sch of Med, Hamamatsu Aging of the primate proceeds slowly and is characterized by prominent senescence, i.e., prolonged survival after reproductive years. To further our understanding of the characteristic aging process of the primate brain, we conducted DNA microarray analysis of Brodmannâ€™s area 46 (A46) and hippocampus in aged monkeys, because these areas are thought to be important for the process of learning and memory. Monkeys (n = 24) were assigned into 4 groups based on age (young; mean age 10.0 and aged; mean age 26.3) and sex (female and male). RNA isolated from 48 brain tissues was applied to the 4 Ã— 44K Rhesus Monkey Oligo Microarrays (Agilent). For 1205 genes expressed differentially more than 1.5 fold between young and aged monkey hippocampus or A46, we employed GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) to evaluate whether pre-defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences. In aged female hippocampus but not male hippocampus, homeostasis-related gene sets were significantly upregulated (FDR q-value < 0.25). The hyper-expression of genes encoding chemokine and complement proteins engaged in immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory activity implies age-related inflammation or disease progression. Moreover, in aged female hippocampus and A46, gene set involved in neurological system process was significantly downregulated (FDR q-value < 0.25). The decreased expression of genes encoding neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, cortistatin, corticotropin releasing hormone and 5HT2A receptor may lead to neuronal hypofunction in these regions. On the other hand, male hippocampus and A46 did not present significant age-related differences in any gene sets. These sex differences in brain aging process may result from molecular and cellular deterioration caused by drastic change in hormonal dynamics in aged female monkeys. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1354 P2-n14 tert-Butylhydroquinone protects dopaminergic neurons from MPP+ cytotoxicity primarily via normalization of glutathione levels in midbrain slice cultures Yukie Sato , Akinori Hisatsune, Yoichiro Isohama, Hiroshi Katsuki Dept Chemico-pharmacol Sci, Grad Sch Pharm Sci, Kumamoto Univ, Kumamoto Parkinson disease is characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, which leads to severe motor deficits including tremors and inability to initiate movement. Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenic events in this neurodegenerative disorder. Under conditions of increased oxidative stress, a transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) binds to antioxidant response element to induce expression of enzymes related to phase II detoxification and antioxidative defense. Thus, promotion of recruitment of Nrf2 can be a target of neuroprotective therapy that confers resistance to a variety of oxidative stress-related insults on neurons. Here we examined the effect of tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), an activator of Nrf2, against of MPP+ cytotoxicity in rat midbrain slice cultures. Immunohistochemical examinations on tyrosine hydroxylase revealed that tBHQ (5â€“40 M) inhibited dopaminergic neuron loss induced by 48-h application of 30 M MPP+, in a concentration-dependent manner. Because Nrf2 activation leads to its translocation to the nucleus, we examined Nrf2 levels in nuclear fractions obtained from midbrain slice homogenates after drug treatment, by western blotting. tBHQ treatment increased Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus in a concentration-dependent manner, which was accelerated in the presence of MPP+. We next examined possible involvement of glutathione synthesis and heme oxygenase-1 expression, two major pathways downstream of Nrf2 activation, in the neuroprotective effect of tBHQ. We found that tBHQ significantly increased glutathione content in midbrain slices, and that depletion of glutathione by buthionine sulfoximine abolished the protective effect of tBHQ against MPP+ cytotoxicity. On the other hand, inhibition of heme oxygenase by zinc protoporphyrin IX did not suppress the protective effect of tBHQ. These results suggest that tBHQ protects midbrain dopaminergic neurons via increase in glutathione synthesis. doi:10.1016/j.neures.2010.07.1355 P2-n17 Human DJ-1-specific transcriptional activation of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene Shizuma Ishikawa 1 , Takahiro Taira 2, Kazuko Takahashi-Niki 3, Takeshi Niki 1, Hiroyoshi Ariga 3, Sanae M.M.

Hokkaido University Loss-of-functional mutation in the DJ-1 gene causes a subset of familial Parkinson disease. The mechanism underlying DJ-1-related selective vulnerability in the dopaminergic pathway is, however, not resolved. DJ-1 has multiple functions, including transcriptional regulation, and one of the transcriptional target genes for DJ-1 is the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene whose product is a key enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis. It has been reported that DJ-1 is a neuroprotective transcriptional co-activator that sequesters a transcriptional co-repressor pyrimidine tract-binding protein associated splicing factor (PSF) from the TH gene promoter. In this study, we found that knockdown of human DJ-1 by small interference RNA in human dopaminergic cell lines attenuated the TH gene expression and L-DOPA production but that knockdown or knockout of mouse DJ-1 in mouse cell lines or in DJ-1 knockout mice did not affect such expression and activity of TH. Reporter assays using the human TH gene promoter linked to the luciferase gene showed that stimulation of TH promoter activity was observed in human but not mouse cells transfected with DJ-1. Although human and mouse DJ-1 were associated either with human or with mouse PSF, TH promoter activity inhibited by PSF was restored by human DJ-1 but not mouse DJ-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the complex of PSF with DJ-1 bound to the human but not mouse TH gene promoter. These results suggest a novel",2010,Neuroscience Research
Persistence in high-dimensional linear predictor selection and the virtue of overparametrization,"Let Z = (Y , X 1, ..., X i m), i = 1, ..., n, be i.i.d. random vectors, Z âˆ¼ F, F âˆˆ F . It is desired to predict Y by Î²jXj , where (Î²1, ..., Î²m) âˆˆ B âŠ† R, under a prediction loss. Suppose that m = n, Î± > 1, i.e., there are many more explanatory variables than observations. We consider sets B restricted by the maximal number of non-zero coefficients of their members, or by their l1 radius. We study the following asymptotic question: How â€˜largeâ€™ may the set B be, so that it is still possible to select empirically a predictor whose risk under F is close to that of the best predictor in the set. Sharp bounds for orders of magnitudes are given under various assumptions on F . Algorithmic complexity of the ensuing procedures is also studied. The main message of this paper and the implications of the above derived orders are that under various sparsity assumptions on the optimal predictor there is â€œasymptotically no harmâ€ in introducing many more explanatory variables than observations. Furthermore, such practice can be beneficial in comparison with a procedure that screens in advance a small subset of explanatory variables. Another main result is that â€™Lassoâ€™-type procedures, i.e., optimization under l1 constraint, could be efficient in finding optimal sparse predictors in high dimensions.

Majorization-Minimization algorithms for nonsmoothly penalized objective functions,"The use of penalization, or regularization, has become common in high-dimensional statistical analysis, where an increasingly frequent goal is to simultaneously select important variables and estimate their effects. It has been shown by several authors that these goals can be achieved by minimizing some parameter-dependent ""goodness-of-fit"" function (e.g., a negative loglikelihood) subject to a penalization that promotes sparsity. Penalty functions that are singular at the origin have received substantial attention, arguably beginning with the Lasso penalty (62). The current literature tends to focus on specific combinations of dif- ferentiable goodness-of-fit functions and penalty functions singular at the origin. One result of this combined specificity has been a proliferation in the number of computational algorithms designed to solve fairly narrow classes of optimization problems involving objective functions that are not every- where continuously differentiable. In this paper, we propose a general class of algorithms for optimizing an extensive variety of nonsmoothly penalized objective functions that satisfy certain regularity conditions. The proposed framework utilizes the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm as its core optimization engine. In the case of penalized regression models, the resulting algorithms employ iterated soft-thresholding, implemented com- ponentwise, allowing for fast and stable updating that avoids the need for inverting high-dimensional matrices. We establish convergence theory un- der weaker assumptions than previously considered in the statistical litera- ture. We also demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of new acceleration methods, originally proposed for the EM algorithm, in this class of prob- lems. Simulation results and a microarray data example are provided to demonstrate the algorithm's capabilities and versatility.

A quantile regression analysis of the effect of farmers' attitudes and perceptions on market participation,"The objective of this study is to investigate the subjective determinants of farmersâ€™ participation in output markets in five EU New Member States (NMS) characterised by large semi-subsistence sectors. It employs quantile regression to model market participation reflecting the heterogeneity amongst farmers. The study also uses the Bayesian adaptive lasso to simultaneously select important covariates and estimate the corresponding quantile regression models. The empirical results show that only two variables affect all quantiles, while their effect varies across quantiles. Some of the remaining variables affect the share of output sold at the lower quantiles (i.e. for subsistence- and semi-subsistence-oriented farmers) only, whereas other variables are only significant at the upper quantiles (i.e. for more commercially oriented farms). Advisory services, and particularly agricultural business advice, and information and advice on markets and prices can facilitate the market participation of subsistence-oriented farms.",2013,Journal of Agricultural Economics
Modeling gene-covariate interactions in sparse regression with group structure for genome-wide association studies,"Abstract In genome-wide association studies (GWAS), it is of interest to identify genetic variants associated with phenotypes. For a given phenotype, the associated genetic variants are usually a sparse subset of all possible variants. Traditional Lasso-type estimation methods can therefore be used to detect important genes. But the relationship between genotypes at one variant and a phenotype may be influenced by other variables, such as sex and life style. Hence it is important to be able to incorporate gene-covariate interactions into the sparse regression model. In addition, because there is biological knowledge on the manner in which genes work together in structured groups, it is desirable to incorporate this information as well. In this paper, we present a novel sparse regression methodology for gene-covariate models in association studies that not only allows such interactions but also considers biological group structure. Simulation results show that our method substantially outperforms another method, in which interaction is considered, but group structure is ignored. Application to data on total plasma immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentrations in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), using sex and smoking status as covariates, yields several potentially interesting gene-covariate interactions.",2015,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
Doubly Debiased Lasso: High-Dimensional Inference under Hidden Confounding and Measurement Errors,"Inferring causal relationships or related associations from observational data can be invalidated by the existence of hidden confounders or measurement errors. We focus on high-dimensional linear regression settings, where the measured covariates are affected by hidden confounding. We propose the Doubly Debiased Lasso estimator for single components of the regression coefficient vector. Our advocated method is novel as it simultaneously corrects both the bias due to estimating the high-dimensional parameters as well as the bias caused by the hidden confounding. We establish its asymptotic normality and also prove that it is efficient in the Gauss-Markov sense. The validity of our methodology relies on a dense confounding assumption, i.e. that every confounding variable affects many covariates. The finite sample performance is illustrated with an extensive simulation study and a genomic application.",2020,arXiv: Methodology
A Perturbation Method for Inference on Regularized Regression Estimates.,"Analysis of high dimensional data often seeks to identify a subset of important features and assess their effects on the outcome. Traditional statistical inference procedures based on standard regression methods often fail in the presence of high-dimensional features. In recent years, regularization methods have emerged as promising tools for analyzing high dimensional data. These methods simultaneously select important features and provide stable estimation of their effects. Adaptive LASSO and SCAD for instance, give consistent and asymptotically normal estimates with oracle properties. However, in finite samples, it remains difficult to obtain interval estimators for the regression parameters. In this paper, we propose perturbation resampling based procedures to approximate the distribution of a general class of penalized parameter estimates. Our proposal, justified by asymptotic theory, provides a simple way to estimate the covariance matrix and confidence regions. Through finite sample simulations, we verify the ability of this method to give accurate inference and compare it to other widely used standard deviation and confidence interval estimates. We also illustrate our proposals with a data set used to study the association of HIV drug resistance and a large number of genetic mutations.",2011,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Sparsity-assisted bearing fault diagnosis using multiscale period group lasso.,"Fault diagnosis methods based on sparse representation (SR) theory have achieved great success recently. However, it is still challenging to extract features from signals with strong noise interference. In this paper, a new method named multiscale period group Lasso (MPG Lasso) is proposed, which is a multiscale SR model performed in different wavelet subbands and uses nonconvex regularization functions to enhance sparsity within and across groups. The improvements of this method over conventional SR models are mainly made in the three aspects. First, impulses are extracted in the wavelet domain which is likely to produce more sparse results. Second, a multiscale periodic prior is embedded within the penalty function to make the extraction of characteristic frequency more accurate. Third, a rule of adaptive hyper-parameter setting in the model is further studied to simplify the industrial application of MPG Lasso. Performance of MPG Lasso is verified by a series of simulation experiments and diagnosis of fault bearings. The results show that MPG Lasso gets better performance than other up-to-date methods.",2019,ISA transactions
Abstract PD3-02: Polygenic risk scores provide clinically meaningful risk stratification among women carrying moderate penetrance pathogenic variants in breast cancer predisposition genes: Results from the CARRIERS study,"Background: Pathogenic variants detected in multi-gene cancer predisposition panels are increasingly used to counsel women regarding their risk for breast cancer. However, the clinical implications of moderate penetrance genes (e.g. CHEK2, ATM) remain unclear. Breast MRI is indicated for women with a lifetime risk of breast cancer of >20%, and polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on common variants discovered in recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may identify women with pathogenic variants in CHEK2 and ATM who are above or below this level of risk. PRS may also stratify carriers with substantially elevated lifetime risks of breast cancer. Previous work found that PRS modified breast cancer risk in carriers of pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2, but the joint effects of pathogenic variants and PRS have not been studied in samples drawn from the general population. There is also no published study evaluating the effect of PRS among women with pathogenic variants in genes other than BRCA1/2 and CHEK2. Here, we evaluated the joint effects of PRS and pathogenic variants in ten established breast cancer predisposition genes in a population-based case-control sample. Method: We analyzed 43,144 non-Hispanic European-ancestry individuals (20,988 controls and 22,120 cases) drawn from 7 cohorts and 2 population-based case-control studies in the CAnceR RIsk Estimates Related to Susceptibilityâ€ (CARRIERS) consortium. Targeted sequencing was performed using a dual bar-coded QIAseq panel of breast cancer predisposition genes. Variant calling was conducted with Haplotype Caller and Vardict. The PRS was calculated based on 106 common variants using effect estimates from the largest published breast cancer GWAS. Genetic status was evaluated for 10 breast cancer predisposition genes: ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, NF1, PALB2 and TP53. Lasso Penalized regression was performed to assess the combined effect on overall breast cancer of pathogenic variants and common variants (including main and interaction effects between age, family history, carrier status and PRS). The fraction of women at >2-fold increased risk (which is associated with approximately 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer) was calculated for pathogenic variant carriers and non-carriers of different family history and age groups ( 70yrs old). Results: Among non-carriers, one standard deviation change in the PRS was associated with a 1.63x change in odds of breast cancer. The best-fitting risk model did not include any PRS-by-carrier interaction terms, implying the relative risk gradient associated with PRS among women with pathogenic variants is similar to that among non-carriers. For carriers of pathogenic variants in moderate penetrance genes with no family history of breast cancer, the PRS can identify 60.6% of ATM pathogenic variant carriers and 30% of CHEK2 pathogenic variant carriers that have less than 2-fold risk of breast cancer; when carriers have a family history of breast cancer, the PRS can identify 30% of ATM pathogenic variant carriers and 11.8% of CHEK2 pathogenic variant carriers with less than 2-fold risk of breast cancer. Conclusion: In our large, population-based case-control study, the effect of the PRS among pathogenic variant carriers was not significantly different than among non-carriers. However, the PRS may be particularly important for estimating breast cancer risk among carriers of pathogenic variants in moderate penetrance genes such as CHEK2 and ATM, enabling a more precise approach for MRI screening strategy and breast cancer risk management.

Integrative Analysis of Cancer Diagnosis Studies with Composite Penalization.,"In cancer diagnosis studies, high-throughput gene profiling has been extensively conducted, searching for genes whose expressions may serve as markers. Data generated from such studies have the ""large d, small n"" feature, with the number of genes profiled much larger than the sample size. Penalization has been extensively adopted for simultaneous estimation and marker selection. Because of small sample sizes, markers identified from the analysis of single datasets can be unsatisfactory. A cost-effective remedy is to conduct integrative analysis of multiple heterogeneous datasets. In this article, we investigate composite penalization methods for estimation and marker selection in integrative analysis. The proposed methods use the minimax concave penalty (MCP) as the outer penalty. Under the homogeneity model, the ridge penalty is adopted as the inner penalty. Under the heterogeneity model, the Lasso penalty and MCP are adopted as the inner penalty. Effective computational algorithms based on coordinate descent are developed. Numerical studies, including simulation and analysis of practical cancer datasets, show satisfactory performance of the proposed methods.",2014,"Scandinavian journal of statistics, theory and applications"
Robust Registration-Based Tracking by Sparse Representation with Model Update,"Object tracking by image registration based on the Lucas-Kanade method has been studied over decades. The classical method is known to be sensitive to illumination changes, pose variation and occlusion. A great number of papers have been presented to address this problem. Despite great advances achieved thus far, robust registration-based tracking in challenging conditions remains unsolved. This paper presents a novel method which extends the Lucas-Kanade using the sparse representation. Our objective function involves joint optimization of the warp function and the optimal linear combination of the test image with a set of basis vectors in a dictionary. The objective function is regularized by l1 norm of the linear combination coefficients. It is a non-linear and non-convex problem and we minimize it by alternating between the warp function and coefficients. We thus achieve an efficient algorithm which iteratively solves the LASSO and classical Lucas-Kanade by optimizing one while keeping another fixed. Unlike existing sparsity-based work that uses exemplar templates as the object model, we explore the low-dimensional linear subspace of the object appearances for object representation. For adaptation to dynamical scenarios, the mean vector and basis vectors of the appearance subspace are updated online by incremental SVD. Experiments demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method in challenging image sequences.",2012,
The Effect of Education on Health Perception and Health Related Behavior: Evidence from the Russian Federation,"We use individual data from SAGE and RLMS surveys to infer whether education has an effect on the health of Russian citizens. Both direct and indirect ways of impact are estimated by means of the variety of econometrics methods. IV regression is used to assess the former effect which implies profound changes in understanding individualâ€™s health and how health care system works. The latter way means changes in the health-related behaviour, estimates for which are deduced by OLS. Different statistical methods like Lasso regression and Generalized Additive Model with splines are used to go far beyond OLS results. The obtained results confirm the existence and significance of both ways of impact: better educated people understand their health and bodies better and also switch to a much healthier way of life.",2016,
LassoNet: Deep Lasso-Selection of 3D Point Clouds,"Selection is a fundamental task in exploratory analysis and visualization of 3D point clouds. Prior researches on selection methods were developed mainly based on heuristics such as local point density, thus limiting their applicability in general data. Specific challenges root in the great variabilities implied by point clouds (e.g., dense vs. sparse), viewpoint (e.g., occluded vs. non-occluded), and lasso (e.g., small vs. large). In this work, we introduce LassoNet, a new deep neural network for lasso selection of 3D point clouds, attempting to learn a latent mapping from viewpoint and lasso to point cloud regions. To achieve this, we couple user-target points with viewpoint and lasso information through 3D coordinate transform and naive selection, and improve the method scalability via an intention filtering and farthest point sampling. A hierarchical network is trained using a dataset with over 30K lasso-selection records on two different point cloud data. We conduct a formal user study to compare LassoNet with two state-of-the-art lasso-selection methods. The evaluations confirm that our approach improves the selection effectiveness and efficiency across different combinations of 3D point clouds, viewpoints, and lasso selections.

Overlapping group lasso for high-dimensional generalized linear models,"Abstract Structured sparsity has recently been a very popular technique to deal with the high-dimensional data. In this paper, we mainly focus on the theoretical problems for the overlapping group structure of generalized linear models (GLMs). Although the overlapping group lasso method for GLMs has been widely applied in some applications, the theoretical properties about it are still unknown. Under some general conditions, we presents the oracle inequalities for the estimation and prediction error of overlapping group Lasso method in the generalized linear model setting. Then, we apply these results to the so-called Logistic and Poisson regression models. It is shown that the results of the Lasso and group Lasso procedures for GLMs can be recovered by specifying the group structures in our proposed method. The effect of overlap and the performance of variable selection of our proposed method are both studied by numerical simulations. Finally, we apply our proposed method to two gene expression data sets: the p53 data and the lung cancer data.",2019,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
Variable selection for joint models with time-varying coefficients,"Many clinical studies collect longitudinal and survival data concurrently. Joint models combining these two types of outcomes through shared random effects are frequently used in practical data analysis. The standard joint models assume that the coefficients for the longitudinal and survival components are time-invariant. In many applications, the assumption is overly restrictive. In this research, we extend the standard joint model to include time-varying coefficients, in both longitudinal and survival components, and we present a data-driven method for variable selection. Specifically, we use a B-spline decomposition and penalized likelihood with adaptive group LASSO to select the relevant independent variables and to distinguish the time-varying and time-invariant effects for the two model components. We use Gaussian-Legendre and Gaussian-Hermite quadratures to approximate the integrals in the absence of closed-form solutions. Simulation studies show good selection and estimation performance. Finally, we use the proposed procedure to analyze data generated by a study of primary biliary cirrhosis.",2019,Statistical Methods in Medical Research
An Improved Sparse Regularization Method for Weak Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery Based Upon Acceleration Signals,"The periodical impulses caused by the localized fault are the important feature information for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. However, it is a challenge to extract weak and sensitive fault characteristics information from non-stationary vibration signals that are often corrupted by heavy background noise, especially at the early stage of faulty development. In this paper, a novel fault diagnosis methodology is proposed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) and the improved non-convex regularization algorithm (I-NCRA) for the weak fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The proposed I-NCRA model is based on the formulation of a convex optimization problem, which consists of a signal-fidelity function and two parameterized non-convex penalty terms, and it not relies on the priori knowledge to form a training dictionary. Due to the improved non-convex penalty function induces sparsity more strongly than the L1-norm, the traditional drawbacks such as the strict convexity problem of objective function and the convergence problem of traditional non-convex regularization approach (e.g., Lp-Norm ( $0 < p < 1$ ) and reweighted L2-/L1-norm) can be addressed. Furthermore, the solution of the I-NCRA model is derived by ADMM technique; meanwhile, the strict convexity and convergence of the proposed objective cost model are also provided. Last, the diagnostic results of simulation experiment, practical rolling bearing, and gearbox experiments indicate that the proposed method is superior to the L1-norm fused lasso algorithm and the traditional spectral kurtogram method in weak fault feature extraction.",2018,IEEE Sensors Journal
A Framework for Inter-Subject Prediction of Functional Connectivity From Structural Networks,"Functional connections between brain regions are supported by structural connectivity. Both functional and structural connectivity are estimated from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and offer complementary information on brain organization and function. However, imaging only provides noisy measures, and we lack a good neuroscientific understanding of the links between structure and function. Therefore, inter-subject joint modeling of structural and functional connectivity, the key to multimodal biomarkers, is an open challenge. We present a probabilistic framework to learn across subjects a mapping from structural to functional brain connectivity. Expanding on our previous work [1], our approach is based on a predictive framework with multiple sparse linear regression. We rely on the randomized LASSO to identify relevant anatomo-functional links with some confidence interval. In addition, we describe resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in the setting of Gaussian graphical models, on the one hand imposing conditional independences from structural connectivity and on the other hand parameterizing the problem in terms of multivariate autoregressive models. We introduce an intrinsic measure of prediction error for functional connectivity that is independent of the parameterization chosen and provides the means for robust model selection. We demonstrate our methodology with regions within the default mode and the salience network as well as, atlas-based cortical parcellation.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging

Pacer: fine-grained interactive paper via camera-touch hybrid gestures on a cell phone,"PACER is a gesture-based interactive paper system that supports fine-grained paper document content manipulation through the touch screen of a cameraphone. Using the phone's camera, PACER links a paper document to its digital version based on visual features. It adopts camera-based phone motion detection for embodied gestures (e.g. marquees, underlines and lassos), with which users can flexibly select and interact with document details (e.g. individual words, symbols and pixels). The touch input is incorporated to facilitate target selection at fine granularity, and to address some limitations of the embodied interaction, such as hand jitter and low input sampling rate. This hybrid interaction is coupled with other techniques such as semi-real time document tracking and loose physical-digital document registration, offering a gesture-based command system. We demonstrate the use of PACER in various scenarios including work-related reading, maps and music score playing. A preliminary user study on the design has produced encouraging user feedback, and suggested future research for better understanding of embodied vs. touch interaction and one vs. two handed interaction.",2010,

The total complication rate across the ten included studies was 1.69%. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis shows that EUS-guided biopsy is a powerful tool for differentiating pelvic masses with a high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, it is a safe procedure with a low rate of complication, although more high-quality prospective studies are required to further validate safety. Mo1493 EUS-Guided Intratumoral Injection of CHST15 Dsrna for Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer: an Investigator-Initiated Trial Makoto Nishimura*, Naohisa Yahagi Department of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, Itabashi-ku, Japan; Cancer Center, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Japan Background: The glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate E (CS-E) is known to promote tumor invasion by cleaving CD44 on pancreatic cancer cells. Interference with CS-E has been shown to inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis in nonclinical studies. CS-E is upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissue and its biosynthesis is mediated by specific enzyme carbohydrate sulfotransferase 15 (CHST15). CHST15 mRNA is reported to be upregulated and to correlate with poor prognosis in several types of cancer. We have shown that synthesized CHST15 dsRNA can inhibit the expression of CHST15 glycogene and reduce the secretion of soluble CD44 variant both in dose-dependent manners in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. In this study, we conducted an investigator initiated trial of CHST15 dsRNA through EUS-guided intratumoral injection in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Objective: To assess safety, feasibility, and tolerability in unresectable pancreatic cancer patients treated by EUS-guided intratumoral injection of CHST15 dsRNA. Setting: Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital Patients: Patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer were enrolled. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome measures were safety, feasibility, and tolerability. Secondary outcome measures were response in tumor size, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival. Histopathologically, tumor specimens were also evaluated with CHST15 immuno-stain before and 1 month after injection. Results: A total of four stage IV pancreatic cancer patients with a median age of 76.5 years (male: femaleZ 2:2) were enrolled. Three of them had undergone standard chemotherapy including gemcitabine or S-1 regimen, and the other patient refused chemotherapy. For all patients, a total of 16 ml (250nM) of dsRNA was successfully injected into the tumor under EUS guidance using a 22 gauge needle without related adverse events. Mean tumor size changed from 32.2 mm to 30 mm in diameter one month after the first injection. Histopathologically, all patients (100%) were CHST15 positive in the primary specimen, and reduced CHST15 staining one month after the first injection was detectable, suggesting the effectiveness of dsRNA injection. One patientâ€™s specimen showed partial necrosis of the tumor. Limitations: This was a single-center clinical trial. Conclusions: This was the first-in-patient trial of EUS-guided injection of dsRNA against glycogene in unresectable pancreatic cancer in the world. A single dose administration of CHST15 dsRNA showed no drug-related adverse effects at the tested concentration. High safety and feasibility were demonstrated, which will contribute to further clinical trials investigating this anti-tumor agent. Mo1494 EUS-Guided Radiofrequency Ablation (EUS-RFA) Using a Novel Internally Cooled Needle Electrode for Pancreatic Insulinoma: a Case Series in Humans Sundeep Lakhtakia*, Mohan Ramchandani, Rajesh Gupta, Sushma Venugopal, Domenico Galasso, Nageshwar D. Reddy Digestive Endoscopy, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy; Gastroenterology and Therapeutic Endoscopy Department, Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Hyderabad, India; Gastroenterology Department, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY Background: Insulinomas are one of the most common functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). Although usually small in size, difficult to localize during surgery and with important postoperative morbidities, surgical removal is still the standard of care. A non-surgical treatment for symptoms relief is needed in patients unfit for surgical resection, or unwilling. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has already been used for localization, fine needle aspiration, tattooing and alcohol ablation of insulinoma and other PNETs. Intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been reported for insulinoma. An EUS-guided RFA (EUS-RFA) of insulinoma, when possible, may be beneficial for symptoms relief. There are no reports of EUSRFA of insulinoma. We present a case series of 3 patients who underwent EUSRFA using a novel internally cooled needle electrode. Objective: To evaluate feasibility, safety and efficacy of EUS-RFA to manage patients with symptomatic insulinoma. Setting: Tertiary care academic center.Patients: Patients presenting at our institution with symptomatic insulinoma, unfit or unwilling for surgery. Interventions: EUS-RFA of pancreatic insulinoma using a AB440 GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY Volume 81, No. 5S : 2015 novel 19G internally cooled needle electrode.Main outcome measurements: Technical success in targeting and ablating the insulinoma; adverse events; symptoms and biochemical levels improvement up to 6 months after EUS RFA. Results: Three male patients (mean age 45 years) with a single or multiple symptomatic insulinoma (Table 1) underwent EUS-RFA. All had rapid symptoms relief and biochemical markers level reduction to normal range. There were no procedure related adverse events. Patients remained symptom free at last follow-up (Table 2). Limitations: Small number of cases, single tertiary care center. Conclusions: EUS-RFA is feasible, apparently safe and effective for symptoms relief in symptomatic pancreatic insulinoma. Table 1.

Matrix-Similarity Based Loss Function and Feature Selection for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis,"Recent studies on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), diagnosis presented that the tasks of identifying brain disease status and predicting clinical scores based on neuroimaging features were highly related to each other. However, these tasks were often conducted independently in the previous studies. Regarding the feature selection, to our best knowledge, most of the previous work considered a loss function defined as an element-wise difference between the target values and the predicted ones. In this paper, we consider the problems of joint regression and classification for AD/MCI diagnosis and propose a novel matrix-similarity based loss function that uses high-level information inherent in the target response matrix and imposes the information to be preserved in the predicted response matrix. The newly devised loss function is combined with a group lasso method for joint feature selection across tasks, i.e., clinical scores prediction and disease status identification. We conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and showed that the newly devised loss function was effective to enhance the performances of both clinical score prediction and disease status identification, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.",2014,2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

"Mating Systems, Sex Change and Sexual Demography in the Rainbow Wrasse, Thalassoma lucasanum","Previous work indicates that sex change becomes less advantageous and less common in fish species which live at relatively high population densities. This study extends these observations to the abundant rainbow wrasse (Thalassoma lucasanum) of the eastern tropical Pacific. In this species, large territorial males in terminal phase coloration are uncommon, and the overwhelming majority of spawnings occur in groups of smaller initial phase males. For T. lucasanum, sex change itself is a relatively rare event; fewer than 30% of the terminal phase individuals are derived from females. The initial phase population consists of nearly 50% primary males, their theoretical maximum abundance. Laboratory experiments indicate that sex and color change is socially mediated: the largest individual changed color (and sex if she was a female) in ten groups initiated without a terminal phase male, while no transformations occurred in 15 control groups. The retention of sex-changing ability should carry little or no cost even in densely distributed populations, and can be of great advantage in any small groups that might exist. In addition to ensuring proper timing of transformation in small groups, social mediation of sex change may be of value in preventing sex change from occurring at all in situations where the costs of transformation are too great.",1982,Copeia
Identification of survival-associated alternative splicing events and signatures in adrenocortical carcinoma based on TCGA SpliceSeq data,"OBJECTIVE
To explore the correlations among alternative splicing (AS), splicing factors (SF) and survival outcome in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) patients.


RESULTS
A total of 92 ACC patients were included. Univariate analysis identified 3919 AS events significantly associated with overall survival. Lasso method followed by multivariate analysis revealed that the prognostic capacity of these survival-related AS events is satisfactory. Interestingly, we found that the area under the curve (AUC) of AA, AD, AP and RI were more than 0.9, indicating that these four types of AS were of great significance. Independent prognostic analysis showed that only the risk score was the independent risk factor of ACC survival. Finally, we constructed an interesting interaction network between AS and SF.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first and most comprehensive study to explore the aberrant AS variants in ACC, which might provide novel insights into molecular mechanism of ACC.


METHODS
The transcriptome data, clinical information and Percent Spliced In (PSI) values of the ACC were obtained from TCGA database and TCGA SpliceSeq data portal. Lasso method and uni/multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to identify survival-related AS events and develop multi-AS-based signatures. The relationship between AS events and SFs was also investigated.",2020,Aging (Albany NY)
The differential impact of state tobacco control policies on cessation treatment utilization across established tobacco disparities groups.,"Tobacco control policies are effective in promoting quit attempts and increase the likelihood that smokers use evidence-based cessation treatments (e.g., nicotine replacement therapies (NRT), non-NRT medications, behavioral treatment, and/or quitlines). However, what is less clear is how these policies might differentially impact different groups of smokers, perhaps in some cases even widening disparities in the use of evidence-based tobacco dependence treatments. This paper examined how different state-level tobacco control policies impact the use of evidence-based cessation treatments by race/ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status (SES), age, and smoking history. Participants included 9110 adult smokers reporting a past-year quit attempt within the 2010-2011 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. Lasso regression modeling was used to identify a subset of interactions between tobacco policies and individual smoker characteristics that predicted use of evidence-based cessation treatment. Significant interactions were fitted via participant-weighted generalized linear models to determine effect sizes and relations to each cessation treatment outcome. Results highlighted that various state level tobacco control policies differentially impacted the reported use of both prescription and non-prescription stop smoking medications by race/ethnicity, age, and SES. The relationship between state level tobacco control policies and the use of behavioral treatments and quitlines did not differ by smoker characteristics. In sum, tobacco control policies differentially impact the use of FDA approved stop smoking medications across different race/ethnicity, age, and SES groups. Understanding such effects can help to target interventions to ensure equal access to evidence-based tobacco dependence treatments.",2017,Preventive medicine

Design of comprehensive evaluation index system for P2P credit risk of â€œthree ruralâ€ borrowers,"In the emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) lending industry, risks such as credit risk and default risk will bring huge losses to online lending platforms and investors. Therefore, it is necessary to design a reasonable evaluation index system of credit risk to scientifically evaluate the risk level of borrowers. This paper studies the design of comprehensive evaluation index system for P2P credit risk of â€œthree ruralâ€ (i.e., agriculture, rural areas and farmers) borrowers. Concretely, we construct the feature set for P2P credit risk of â€œthree ruralâ€ borrowers. Based on the traditional index system, we add the static indexes specific to the agriculture-related borrowers and the dynamic indexes reflect the Internet as the preliminary indexes of the feature set and select the borrowers data of the â€œPterosaur loanâ€ platform as the research sample. Then, 35 borrower credit features are extracted as a feature set of credit risk. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection method based on filter and wrapper to select the main features from 35 initial borrower credit features. In the stage of filter, three filter methods are used to calculate the importance of the unbalanced features. In the stage of wrapper, a Lasso-logistic method is proposed to filter the feature subset through heuristic search algorithm. In the end, 21 main independent features are selected according to the classification accuracy, which constitute the evaluation index system of credit risk of â€œthree ruralâ€ borrowers.",2019,
A Least Squares Method for Detecting Multiple Change Points in a Univariate Time Series,"Detecting and interpreting influential turning points in time series data is a routine research question in many disciplines of applied social science research. Here we propose a method for identifying important turning points in a univariate time series. The most rudimentary methods are inadequate when the researcher lacks preexisting expectations or hypotheses concerning where such turning points ought to exist. Other alternatives are computationally intensive and dependent on strict model assumptions. Our method is fused LASSO regression, a variant of regularized least squares method, providing a convenient alternative for estimation and inference of multiple change points under mild assumptions. We provide two examples to illustrate the method in social science applications. First, we assessed the validity of our method by reanalyzing the Greenback prices data used in (Willard et al. in Am Econ Rev 86:1001â€“1017, 1996). We next used the method to identify major change points in President Clintonâ€™s approval ratings.",2018,
Prediction of best features in heterogeneous Lung adenocarcinoma samples using Least Absolute Shrinking and Selection Operator,"This study aims to create a tumor heterogeneity-based model for predicting the best features of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in multiple cancer subtypes using the Least Absolute Shrinking and Selection Operator (LASSO). The RNA-Seq raw count data of 533 LUAD samples and 59 normal samples were downloaded from the TCGA data portal. Based on consensus clustering method samples was divided into two subtypes, and clusters were validated using silhouette width. Furthermore, we estimated subtypes for the abundance of immune and non-immune stromal cell populations which infiltrated cancer tissue. We established the LASSO model for predicting each subtypeâ€™s best features. Enrichment pathway analysis was then carried out. Finally, the validity of the LASSO model for identifying features was established by the survival analysis. Our study suggests that the unsupervised clustering and Machine learning methods such as LASSO model-based feature selection can be effectively used to predict relevant genes which might play an essential role in cancer diagnosis.",2019,bioRxiv
"Iterative Hard Thresholding in GWAS: Generalized Linear Models, Prior Weights, and Double Sparsity","Background Consecutive testing of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is usually employed to identify genetic variants associated with complex traits. Ideally one should model all covariates in unison, but most existing analysis methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) perform only univariate regression. Results We extend and efficiently implement iterative hard thresholding (IHT) for multiple regression, treating all SNPs simultaneously. Our extensions accommodate generalized linear models (GLMs), prior information on genetic variants, and grouping of variants. In our simulations, IHT recovers up to 30% more true predictors than SNP-by-SNP association testing, and exhibits a 2 to 3 orders of magnitude decrease in false positive rates compared to lasso regression. We also test IHT on the UK Biobank hypertension phenotypes and the Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1966 cardiovascular phenotypes. We find that IHT scales to the large datasets of contemporary human genetics and recovers the plausible genetic variants identified by previous studies. Conclusions Our real data analysis and simulation studies suggest that IHT can (a) recover highly correlated predictors, (b) avoid over-fitting, (c) deliver better true positive and false positive rates than either marginal testing or lasso regression, (d) recover unbiased regression coefficients, (e) exploit prior information and group-sparsity and (f) be used with biobank sized data sets. Although these advances are studied for GWAS inference, our extensions are pertinent to other regression problems with large numbers of predictors.",2019,bioRxiv
Network Exploration via the Adaptive Lasso and Scad Penalties.,"Graphical models are frequently used to explore networks, such as genetic networks, among a set of variables. This is usually carried out via exploring the sparsity of the precision matrix of the variables under consideration. Penalized likelihood methods are often used in such explorations. Yet, positive-definiteness constraints of precision matrices make the optimization problem challenging. We introduce non-concave penalties and the adaptive LASSO penalty to attenuate the bias problem in the network estimation. Through the local linear approximation to the non-concave penalty functions, the problem of precision matrix estimation is recast as a sequence of penalized likelihood problems with a weighted L(1) penalty and solved using the efficient algorithm of Friedman et al. (2008). Our estimation schemes are applied to two real datasets. Simulation experiments and asymptotic theory are used to justify our proposed methods.",2009,The annals of applied statistics
Robust colour calibration of an imaging system using a colour space transform and advanced regression modelling.,"A new algorithm for the conversion of device dependent RGB colour data into device independent L*a*b* colour data without introducing noticeable error has been developed. By combining a linear colour space transform and advanced multiple regression methodologies it was possible to predict L*a*b* colour data with less than 2.2 colour units of error (CIE 1976). By transforming the red, green and blue colour components into new variables that better reflect the structure of the L*a*b* colour space, a low colour calibration error was immediately achieved (Î”E(CAL) = 14.1). Application of a range of regression models on the data further reduced the colour calibration error substantially (multilinear regression Î”E(CAL) = 5.4; response surface Î”E(CAL) = 2.9; PLSR Î”E(CAL) = 2.6; LASSO regression Î”E(CAL) = 2.1). Only the PLSR models deteriorated substantially under cross validation. The algorithm is adaptable and can be easily recalibrated to any working computer vision system. The algorithm was tested on a typical working laboratory computer vision system and delivered only a very marginal loss of colour information Î”E(CAL) = 2.35. Colour features derived on this system were able to safely discriminate between three classes of ham with 100% correct classification whereas colour features measured on a conventional colourimeter were not.",2012,Meat science
econstructing the functional connectivity of multiple spike trains sing Hawkes models,"Background: Statistical models that predict neuron spike occurrence from the earlier spiking activity of the whole recorded network are promising tools to reconstruct functional connectivity graphs. Some of the previously used methods are in the general statistical framework of the multivariate Hawkes processes. However, they usually require a huge amount of data, some prior knowledge about the recorded network, and/or may produce an increasing number of spikes along time during simulation. New method: Here, we present a method, based on least-square estimators and LASSO penalty criteria, for a particular class of Hawkes processes that can be used for simulation. Results: Testing our method on small networks modeled with Leaky Integrate and Fire demonstrated that it efficiently detects both excitatory and inhibitory connections. The few errors that occasionally occur with complex networks including common inputs, weak and chained connections, can be discarded based on objective criteria. Comparison with existing methods: With respect to other existing methods, the present one allows to reconstruct functional connectivity of small networks without prior knowledge of their properties or architecture, using an experimentally realistic amount of data. Conclusions: The present method is robust, stable, and can be used on a personal computer as a routine procedure to infer connectivity graphs and generate simulation models from simultaneous spike train",2018,
