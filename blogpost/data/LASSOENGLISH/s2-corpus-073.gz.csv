"High-dimensional Bias-corrected Inference, with Applications to fMRI Studies","In neuroimaging studies, measures of neural structure and function are used to try to predict clinical outcomes in adults. Identifying biomarkers that reflect underlying neuropathological processes can provide promising neural targets for future therapeutic interventions. This identification is typically done using linear or generalized linear models (GLM) with many covariates and relatively few subjects. Thus, regularization is used to select the salient covariates in the model. In this thesis, we compare the performance of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, adaptive LASSO regression, debiased LASSO regression, and regularized zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model in two simulation settings. The performance of LASSO regression with Poisson and Gaussian models are similar but for all these approaches the zero-inflated model outperforms the rest. We apply these approaches to the data from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study. We then study the bias correction of GLM and the application on ZIP data. We apply a decorrelated score approach to address Poisson distributed data and introduce Cornish-Fisher correction to the decorrelated score test. In high-dimension settings, the Cornish-Fisher correction can improve the performance of decorrelated score test for ZIP data.",2019,
Graphical models illustrated complex associations between variables describing human functioning.,"OBJECTIVE
To examine whether graphical modeling is a potentially useful method for the study of human functioning using data collected by means of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).


STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING
The applicability of the method was examined in a convenience sample of 616 patients from a cross-sectional multicentric study undergoing early postacute rehabilitation. Functioning was qualified using 115 second-level ICF categories. The modeling was carried out on a data set with imputed missing values. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for generalized linear models was used to identify conditional dependencies between the ICF categories. Bootstrap aggregating was used to enhance the accuracy and validity of model selection.


RESULTS
The resulting graph showed highly meaningful relationships. For example, one structure centered around speaking and included three paths addressing conversation, speech functions, and mental functions of language.


CONCLUSION
Graphical modeling of human functioning using data collected by means of the ICF yields clinically meaningful results. The structures found may be the basis for the identification of suitable targets for rehabilitation interventions, the identification of confounders and intermediate variables, and the selection of parsimonious sets of variables for multivariate epidemiological modeling.",2009,Journal of clinical epidemiology
"Vomit Apocalypse;or, Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s after Finitude","Recently Anglophone Continental philosophy has been marked by an emergent trend which goes under a variety of names, but which is perhaps best known as â€œspeculative realismâ€ (SR) (alongside such fellowtravellers as â€œobject oriented ontologyâ€). Its proponents now includeâ€”and excludeâ€”such personages as Ian Bogost, Ray Brassier, Levi Bryant, Iain Hamilton Grant, Graham Harman, Quentin Meillassoux, and Timothy Morton, among others.1 The rapid success of SR and object oriented ontology has been remarkable but also controversial: the trend has been accompanied and prosecuted by often-scathing polemics from all sides. Notably, much of the discussion has taken place onlineâ€”which perhaps makes SR the first philosophical movement of the post-convergent digital media environment.2",2013,
Development of an Experimental Laser Sintering Machine to Process New Materials like Nylon 6,"Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is an Additive Manufacturing technology which allows the production of functional polymer parts. Conventionally, Nylon 12 (PA 12), Polyamide 11 (PA 11), glassor aluminum filled materials are used. Those materials do not always meet the requirements for direct production of serial parts by laser sintering. For the so called â€œDirect Manufacturingâ€ of high quality, functional parts, the laser sintering process needs to be further developed and the choice of materials and needs to be expanded. During this research, a laser sintering machine for material qualification has been built up. The advantages are an optimized software solution, an innovative optical system with an adjustable laserspot, an alternative powder coating system and an improved temperature control. The functionality of the test equipment is proved with the standard material PA2200 and the new laser-sintering-material, Polyamide 6X (PA6X) is investigated. The required process parameters for processing PA6X are derived and the mechanical properties are determined by tensile tests.",2017,
Marine Nannoplankton from a British Columbia Fjord,"The qualitative aspects of the nannoplankton in Indian Arm, British Columbia, have been heretofore unknown, although the relative quantitative significance of this difficult group of unicellular organisms is apparent from recent primary production studies using the carbon-14 method. This qualitative study of samples collected in the spring of 1960 in Indian Arm has added a number of new records of distribution for the area (Chromulina sp., Ochromonas ?vallesiaca Chodat, Chrysochromulina sp., Thallasomonas exurgens Butcher); and has led to the discovery of several new species and genera (Chrysamoeba nana sp. nov., Microsportella gen. nov. fiordensis sp. nov., Xanthomonas gen. nov. thalassoides sp. nov., Pseudomicrosportella gen. nov. ornata sp. nov., and Anisomonas astigmatica sp. nov.). The study is being continued to determine qualitatively the seasonal and three-dimensional distribution of these and other nannoplankton in the fjord in relation to the physicalâ€“chemical aspects of the environment.",1961,Botany
Fast Algorithm for the Lasso based L1-Graph Construction,"The lasso-based L1-graph is used in many applications since it can effectively model a set of data points as a graph. The lasso is a popular regression approach and the L1-graph represents data points as nodes by using the regression result. More specifically, by solving the L1-optimization problem of the lasso, the sparse regression coefficients are used to obtain the weights of the edges in the graph. Conventional graph structures such as k-NN graph use two steps, adjacency searching and weight selection, for constructing the graph whereas the lasso-based L1-graph derives the adjacency structure as well as the edge weights simultaneously by using a coordinate descent. However, the construction cost of the lasso-based L1-graph is impractical for large data sets since the coordinate descent iteratively updates the weights of all edges until convergence. Our proposal, Castnet, can efficiently construct the lasso-based L1-graph. In order to avoid updating the weights of all edges, we prune edges that cannot have nonzero weights before entering the iterations. In addition, we update edge weights only if they are nonzero in the iterations. Experiments show that Castnet is significantly faster than existing approaches.",2016,Proc. VLDB Endow.
"High-Dimensional Sparse Matched Case-Control and Case-Crossover Data: A Review of Recent Works, Description of an R Tool and an Illustration of the Use in Epidemiological Studies","The conditional logistic regression model is the standard tool for the analysis of epidemiological studies in which one or more cases (the event of interest), are matched with one or more controls (not showing the event). These situations arise, for example, in matched caseâ€“control and caseâ€“crossover studies. In sparse and high-dimensional settings, penalized methods, such as the Lasso, have emerged as an alternative to conventional estimation and variable selection procedures. We describe the R package clogitLasso, which brings together algorithms to estimate parameters of conditional logistic models using sparsity-inducing penalties. Most individually matched designs are covered, and, beside Lasso, Elastic Net, adaptive Lasso and bootstrapped versions are available. Different criteria for choosing the regularization term are implemented, accounting for the dependency of data. Finally, stability is assessed by resampling methods. We previously review the recent works pertaining to clogitLasso. We also report the use in exploratory analysis of a large pharmacoepidemiological study.",2013,
Stable recovery of low rank matrices from nuclear norm minimization,"Low rank matrix recovery is a new topic drawing the attention of many researchers which addresses the problem of recovering an unknown low rank matrix from few linear measurements. The matrix Dantzig selector and the matrix Lasso are two important algorithms based on nuclear norm minimization. In this paper, we first prove some decay properties of restricted isometry constants, then we discuss the recovery errors of these two algorithms and give a new bound of restricted isometry constant to guarantee stable recovery, which improves the results of [11].",2015,"Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica, English Series"
"Design, Performance, and Calibration of CMS Hadron Endcap Calorimeters","Detailed measurements have been made with the CMS hadron calorimeter endcaps (HE) in response to beams of muons, electrons, and pions. Readout of HE with custom electronics and hybrid photodiodes (HPDs) shows no change of performance compared to readout with commercial electronics and photomultipliers. When combined with lead-tungstenate crystals, an energy resolution of 8% is achieved with 300 GeV/c pions. A laser calibration system is used to set the timing and monitor operation of the complete electronics chain. Data taken with radioactive sources in comparison with test beam pions provides an absolute initial calibration of HE to approximately 4% to 5%. CMS HCAL Collaboration G. Baiatian, A.

Genomic Selection for Predicting Fusarium Head Blight Resistance in a Wheat Breeding Program,"Genomic selection (GS) is a breeding method that uses markerâ€“ trait models to predict unobserved phenotypes. This study developed GS models for predicting traits associated with resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to identify 5054 singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which were then treated as predictor variables in GS analysis. We compared how the prediction accuracy of the genomic-estimated breeding values (GEBVs) was affected by (i) five genotypic imputation methods (ran dom forest imputation [RFI], expectation maximization imputation [EMI], k-nearest neighbor imputation [kNNI], singular value decomposition imputation [SVDI], and the mean imputation [MNI]); (ii) three statistical models (ridge-regression best linear unbiased predictor [RR-BLUP], least absolute shrinkage and operator selector [LASSO], and elastic net); (iii) marker density (p = 500, 1500, 3000, and 4500 SNPs); (iv) training population (TP) size (nTP = 96, 144, 192, and 218); (v) marker-based and pedigree-based relationship matrices; and (vi) control for relatedness in TPs and validation populations (VPs). No discernable differences in prediction accuracy were observed among imputation methods. The RR-BLUP outperformed other models in nearly all scenarios. Accuracies decreased substantially when marker number decreased to 3000 or 1500 SNPs, depending on the trait; when sample size of the training set was less than 192; when using pedigree-based instead of marker-based matrix; or when no control for relatedness was implemented. Overall, moderate to high prediction accuracies were observed in this study, suggesting that GS is a very promising breeding strategy for FHB resistance in wheat.",2015,The Plant Genome
"DÃ©pistage et prise en charge de la toxoplasmose maternelle et congÃ©nitale a Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","OBJECTIVES of this prospective study conducted from November 2011 to July 2013 in Bobo-Dioulasso were to evaluate seroprevalence of toxoplasma infection and to screen maternal and congenital toxoplasmosis during pergravidique monitoring. MATERIAL AND METHODS -Techniques of High Sensitivity Direct Agglutination (HSDA) and ELFA (enzyme linked fluorescent assay) respectively were used for the detection of IgG and IgM toxoplasma. The IgG avidity assay was used for the dating of seroconversion. Screening and monitoring for fetal lesions were echographic. In case of seroconversion, a prenatal treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfamide was introduced. Systematically and regularly immunoassay surveillance of newborn from cases of recent pergravidique toxoplasmosis was performed until complete and final negativity of serology. RESULTS- In total 301 pregnant were included. The overall seroprevalence was 31.9%. Three cases of seroconversion (0.9%) including two cases at the 22nd and one at the 41th week of amenorrhea were noted. Series of obstetrical echography have detected no case of fetal Toxoplasma gondii infection and no congenital toxoplasmosis was detected. CONCLUSION-This study underlines the importance of implementation of a legal disposition for screening and routine monitoring of toxoplasmosis during pregnancy. This is due to the low rate (31.9%) of toxoplasma immunity among gestante in Burkina Faso that may lead to pergravidique acute toxoplasmosis or congenital toxoplasmosis whose outcome is often fatal.",2014,
"Associations between comorbidities, their treatment and survival in patients with interstitial lung diseases â€“ a claims data analysis","BackgroundInterstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are associated with a high burden of disease. However, data on the prognostic impact of comorbidities and comorbidity-related pharmaceutical treatments in patients with various ILDs remain sparse.MethodsUsing longitudinal claims data from a German Statutory Health Insurance Fund, we assessed comorbidity in ILD subtypes and associated drug treatments. Baseline comorbidity was assessed via the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index that was amended by ILD-relevant conditions. Drug treatment was assessed on the substance level using the ATC-codes of drugs prescribed at the time of ILD diagnosis. Subsequently, the comorbid conditions (main analysis) and pharmaceuticalÂ substances (secondary analysis) with a meaningful association to survival were identified for the complete ILD cohort and within the subtype strata. For this, we applied multivariate Cox models using a LASSO selection process and visualized the findings within comorbidomes.ResultsIn the 36,821 patients with ILDs, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), arterial hypertension, and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) were the most prevalent comorbidities. The majority of patients with cardiovascular diseases received pharmaceutical treatment, while, in other relevant comorbidities, treatment quotas were low (COPD 46%, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease 65%). Comorbidities had a clinically meaningful detrimental effect on survival that tended to be more pronounced in the case of untreated conditions (e.g. hazard ratios for treated IHD 0.97 vs. 1.33 for untreated IHD). Moreover, comorbidity impact varied substantially between distinct subtypes.ConclusionsOur analyses suggest that comorbid conditions and their treatment profile significantly affect mortality in various ILDs. Therefore, comprehensive comorbidity assessment and management remains important in any ILD.",2018,Respiratory Research
The heterogeneous effects of the minimum wage on employment across states,"This paper studies the relationship between the minimum wage and the employment rate in the US using the framework of a panel structure model. The approach allows the minimum wage, along with some other controls, to have heterogeneous effects on employment across states which are classified into a group structure. The effects on employment are the same within each group but differ across different groups. The number of groups and the group membership of each state are both unknown a priori. The approach employs the C-Lasso technique, a recently developed classification method that consistently estimates group structure and leads to oracle-efficient estimation of the coefficients. Empirical application of C-Lasso to a US restaurant industry panel over the period 1990 - 2006 leads to the identification of four separate groups at the state level. The findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in the impact of the minimum wage on employment across groups, with both positive and negative effects and geographical patterns manifesting in the data. The results provide some new perspectives on the prolonged debate on the impact of minimum wage on employment.",2019,Economics Letters
Novel in-space manufacturing concepts for the development of large space telescopes,"There is a continuous demand for larger, lighter, and higher quality telescopes. Over the past several decades, we have seen the evolution from launchable 2 meter-class telescopes (such as Hubble), to today's demand for deployable 6 meter-class telescopes (such as JWST), to tomorrow's need for up to 150 meter-class telescopes. As the apertures continue to grow, it will become much more difficult and expensive to launch assembled telescope structures. To address this issue, we are seeing the emergence of new novel structural concepts, such as inflatable structures and membrane optics. While these structural concepts do show promise, it is very difficult to achieve and maintain high surface figure quality. Another potential solution to develop large space telescopes is to move the fabrication facility into space and launch the raw materials. In this paper we present initial in-space manufacturing concepts to enable the development of large telescopes. This includes novel approaches for the fabrication of the optical elements. We will also discuss potential optical designs for large space telescopes and describe their relation to the fabrication methods. These concepts are being developed to meet the demanding requirements of DARPA's LASSO (Large Aperture Space Surveillance Optic) program which currently requires a 150 meter optical aperture with a 16.6 degree field of view.",2006,
Comparing feature selection algorithms using microarray data,"Supervisory Committee Dr. M. Lesperance, Supervisor (Department of Mathematics and Statistics) Dr. M. Tsao, Departmental Member (Department of Mathematics and Statistics) Dr. J. Zhou, Departmental Member (Department of Mathematics and Statistics) In this thesis study, three different feature selection methods, LASSO, SLR, and SMLR, were tested and compared using microarray fold change data. Two real datasets were used to first investigate and compare the ability of the algorithms in selecting feature genes on data under two conditions. It was found that SMLR was quite sensitive to its parameter, and was more accurate in selecting differentially expressed genes when compared to SLR and LASSO. In addition, the model coefficients generated by SMLR had a close relationship with the magnitude of fold changes. Also, SMLRâ€™s ability in selecting differentially expressed genes with data that had more than two conditions was shown to be successful. The results from simulation experiments agreed with the results from the real dataset experiments. Additionally, it was found that different proportions of differentially expressed genes in the data did not affect the performance of LASSO and SLR, but the number of genes selected by SMLR increased with the proportion of regulated genes. Also, as the number of replicates used to build the model increased, the number of genes selected by SMLR increased. This applied to both correctly and incorrectly selected genes. Furthermore, it was found that SMLR performed the best in identifying future treatment samples.",2008,
Analytic solution and stationary phase approximation for the Bayesian lasso and elastic net,"Regression shrinkage and variable selection are important concepts in high-dimensional statistics that allow the inference of robust models from large data sets. Bayesian methods achieve this by subjecting the model parameters to a prior distribution whose mass is centred around zero. In particular, the lasso and elastic net linear regression models employ a double-exponential distribution in their prior, which results in some maximum-likelihood regression coefficients being identically zero. Because of their ability to simultaneously perform parameter estimation and variable selection, these models have become enormously popular. However, there has been limited success in moving beyond maximum-likelihood estimation and deriving estimates for the posterior distribution of regression coefficients, due to a need for computationally expensive Gibbs sampling approaches to evaluate analytically intractable partition function integrals. Here, through the use of the Fourier transform, these integrals are expressed as complex-valued oscillatory integrals over ""regression frequencies"". This results in an analytic expansion and stationary phase approximation for the partition functions of the Bayesian lasso and elastic net, where the non-differentiability of the double-exponential prior distribution has so far eluded such an approach. Use of this approximation leads to highly accurate numerical estimates for the expectation values and marginal posterior distributions of the regression coefficients, thus allowing for Bayesian inference of much higher dimensional models than previously possible.",2018,ArXiv
Component Selection and Smoothing for Nonparametric Regression in Exponential Families,"We propose a new penalized likelihood method for model selection and nonparametric regression in exponential families. In the framework of smoothing spline ANOVA, our method employs a regularization with the penalty functional being the sum of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norms of functional com- ponents in the ANOVA decomposition. It generalizes the LASSO in the linear regression to the nonparametric context, and conducts component selection and smoothing simultaneously. Continuous and categorical variables are treated in a unied fashion. We discuss the connection of the method to the traditional smooth- ing spline penalized likelihood estimation. We show that an equivalent formulation of the method leads naturally to an iterative algorithm. Simulations and examples are used to demonstrate the performances of the method.",2006,Statistica Sinica
InnovaciÃ³n en el uso de las microalgas en termalismo,"In recent years microalgae have been used in various fields such as nutrition, cosmetics, pharmacology, etc. Its use as a therapeutic resource can have an important future in marine cure and thermal therapy, due to their valuable properties. Furthermore, with the increasing of the interest for products in society, the use of microalgae can become an important area of development in the thermal and thalassotherapy centers. Marine microalgae are an important source of vitamins, pigments, proteins and other substances that could be suitable for skin care so that they could be used in the treatment of some dermatological diseases such as psoriasis and acne, and also for cellulite, dry skin, etc. In the field of Hydrotherapy it is important to use products that have been proven and characterized from the point of view of physico-chemical quality and application. The aim of this study is to compare the thermophysical properties and evaluation of skin parameters (such as hydration, elasticity and fatigue) of different peloids made of microalgae and sea water.",2014,
Cretaceous climatic reconstruction from Argentina based on palynological data,"espanolLas reconstrucciones paleoclimaticas se han llevado a cabo haciendo uso de diferentes proxies como indicadores climaticos. Teniendo en cuenta este contexto, los palinomorfos poseen un papel fundamental en el momento de realizar inferencias paleoclimaticas debido a su abundancia y distribucion en diferentes unidades geologicas que abarcan practicamente todo tipo de ambientes. Argentina tiene una gran amplitud latitudinal en Sudamerica, con diversas formaciones geologicas cretacicas que poseen registros palinologicos. Estos representan diferentes condiciones climaticas. El Cretacico fue un periodo en el que se han registrado variaciones climaticas. El objetivo principal de este trabajo es conocer las tendencias climaticas del Cretacico en Argentina, basandose en el analisis cuantitativo de miosporas consideradas indicadoras de ciertas condiciones climaticas, de diferentes unidades geologicas de Argentina. La evaluacion de las palinofloras ha sido abordada desde la bibliografia previa publicada, asi como en datos propios sin publicar. La tendencia paleoclimatica durante el Cretacico muestra que el Cretacico Temprano estuvo marcado por episodios de aridez, con altos valores de Classopollis y Gnetales. Por otra parte, el Cretacico Tardio muestra condiciones de calor y mayor humedad indicadas por los valores altos de plantas de esporas libres (especialmente Briofitas y helechos) y granos de polen de palmeras, y la disminucion hasta la ausencia de los indicadores de aridez. EnglishPaleoclimatic reconstructions have used different proxies as climate indicators. In this context, palynomorphs play a crucial role for making inferences about past climate changes because of their presence and distribution during the geologic history in almost all types of environments. Argentina has a wide latitudinal range in South America, with diverse cretaceous units yielding palynomorphs that represent different climatic conditions. The Cretaceous was a time when climate conditions showed some special variations. Different theories about the climate conditions at this time were postulated. The main aim of this contribution is to understand climate trends during the Cretaceous, based on the quantitative analysis of selected pollen and spores, considered as climate indicators, from different geological units in Argentina. The evaluation of the palynofloras has been undertaken mainly by reviewing published sources from cretaceous basins but also with our own unpublished data. The climatic trend during the Cretaceous showed that the Early Cretaceous is marked by aridity episodes with high values of Classopollis and Gnetales. In contrast, the Late Cretaceous showed warmer and more humid conditions indicated by increasing values of free-sporing plants (especially Bryophytes and ferns) and palm pollen grains, and the decrease until their absence of the aridity indicators.",2018,
The Amazonian Cowboy's Ties,"This essay seeks to portray the different uses of the lasso in a cattle breeding context. The farms are located alongside the Araguari River, in the north-eastern part of the state of AmapÃ¡ (Stoeckli, 2015). The region is marked by floodplains that are periodically flooded at certain times of the year and turn into large dry fields at others. These characteristics of the environment, added to the behaviour of the buffalo, which move as groups in search of better pastures, define the activities of the cowboys. Thus, they are daily going around different parts of the fields in order to search for and look after the cattle. Among the various technical elements that take part in the activity (Ingold, 2000), the Amazonian cowboys usually highlight the lasso as the most essential one. It is part of the cowboyâ€™s life even in the simplest activities in relation to the buffalo and horses. Thus, the lasso is used several times throughout the day of the cowboy, either to contain, to approximate, or even to control the distance of a buffalo or horse. Noteworthy, while it can keep the animals at a distance, it also connects the cowboy to the horse and the buffalo. This connection can be itself a potential danger to humans. Thus, the lasso can be understood as a form of extension of the motor action and strength of the cowboy, as well as the set formed by the cowboy and his horse. Similarly, the possibilities of action vary greatly whether the cowboy is mounted or on foot. The same can be said if the animals to be caught is cornered or in the open fields. Lastly, there is a great deal of difference between tamed animals and wilder ones.",2019,Vibrant: Virtual Brazilian Anthropology
Characterizing $L_{2}$Boosting,"We consider $L_2$Boosting, a special case of Friedman's generic boosting algorithm applied to linear regression under $L_2$-loss. We study $L_2$Boosting for an arbitrary regularization parameter and derive an exact closed form expression for the number of steps taken along a fixed coordinate direction. This relationship is used to describe $L_2$Boosting's solution path, to describe new tools for studying its path, and to characterize some of the algorithm's unique properties, including active set cycling, a property where the algorithm spends lengthy periods of time cycling between the same coordinates when the regularization parameter is arbitrarily small. Our fixed descent analysis also reveals a repressible condition that limits the effectiveness of $L_2$Boosting in correlated problems by preventing desirable variables from entering the solution path. As a simple remedy, a data augmentation method similar to that used for the elastic net is used to introduce $L_2$-penalization and is shown, in combination with decorrelation, to reverse the repressible condition and circumvents $L_2$Boosting's deficiencies in correlated problems. In itself, this presents a new explanation for why the elastic net is successful in correlated problems and why methods like LAR and lasso can perform poorly in such settings.",2012,Annals of Statistics
Design of bioactive peptides derived from CART sequence isolated from the toadfish Thalassophryne nattereri,"The emergence of bacterial resistance due to the indiscriminate use of antibiotics warrants the need for developing new bioactive agents. In this context, antimicrobial peptides are highly useful for managing resistant microbial strains. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of peptides obtained from the venom of the toadfish Thalassophryne nattereri. These peptides were active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. The primary amino acid sequences showed similarity to Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript peptides, and two peptide analogsâ€”Tn CRT2 and Tn CRT3â€”were designed using the AMPA algorithm based on these sequences. The analogs were subjected to physicochemical analysis and antimicrobial screening and were biologically active at concentrations ranging from 2.1 to 13 ÂµM. Zeta potential analysis showed that the peptide analogs increased the positive charge on the cell surface of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The toxicity of Tn CRT2 and Tn CRT3 were analyzed in vitro using a hemolytic assay and tetrazolium salt reduction in fibroblasts and was found to be significant only at high concentrations (up to 40 ÂµM). These results suggest that this methodological approach is appropriate to design novel antimicrobial peptides to fight bacterial infections and represents a new and promising discovery in fish venom.",2020,3 Biotech
Modeling association between multivariate correlated outcomes and high-dimensional sparse covariates: the adaptive SVS method,"ABSTRACT The problem of modeling the relationship between a set of covariates and a multivariate response with correlated components often arises in many areas of research such as genetics, psychometrics, signal processing. In the linear regression framework, such task can be addressed using a number of existing methods. In the high-dimensional sparse setting, most of these methods rely on the idea of penalization in order to efficiently estimate the regression matrix. Examples of such methods include the lasso, the group lasso, the adaptive group lasso or the simultaneous variable selection (SVS) method. Crucially, a suitably chosen penalty also allows for an efficient exploitation of the correlation structure within the multivariate response. In this paper we introduce a novel variant of such method called the adaptive SVS, which is closely linked with the adaptive group lasso. Via a simulation study we investigate its performance in the high-dimensional sparse regression setting. We provide a comparison with a number of other popular methods under different scenarios and show that the adaptive SVS is a powerful tool for efficient recovery of signal in such setting. The methods are applied to genetic data.",2019,Journal of Applied Statistics
Monks and sailors under the Ottoman sultans,"T J hen their empire was in its prime, the Byzantines were among V V other things very proud of their fleet, which defended them suc cessfully against the Arabs for more than three centuries. In the 10th cen tury Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenetus emphasised that the em peror of Constantinople was the lord of all seas up to the Pillars of Hercu les; in the 11th century the provincial nobleman and author Kekaumenos wrote that the glory of Byzantium was its fleet. However, at the end of the same century Byzantine thalassocracy became questionable as pirates in great numbers emerged from all sides, from West and East. Further more, first under the pressure of the Normans of Sicily and later under that of the Italian maritime states, that is Pisa, Venice and Genoa, the Byzantine merchant fleet became more and more marginal. In 1204 the fleet was unable to defend Constantinople against the crusaders. After this fatal event, which rendered the decline of the empire visible, Byzantine control over the seas lost ground to the profit of the western European states which increased their maritime power. Actually Byzan tium became dependent on the fleet of the two Italian maritime republics, Venice and Genoa, which received extensive commercial privileges from the emperor. At the end of the 13th century, Andronicus II Palaeologos realised that his impoverished empire could not sustain the necessary ex pense for the maintenance of a fleet and, early in his reign, he proceeded to its official dissolution; his contemporaries criticised his decision either with surprise or scepticism or with open disapproval.1 In the first years of the 14th century conditions at sea were dramati cally changed under the impact of a new power, that of the Turkish mari time emirates, which began to attack the islands and the littoral of the Aegean using their newly-constructed light vessels.2 Their presence con",2001,
A dynamic screening principle for the Lasso,"The Lasso is an optimization problem devoted to finding a sparse representation of some signal with respect to a predefined dictionary. An original and computationally-efficient method is proposed here to solve this problem, based on a dynamic screening principle. It makes it possible to accelerate a large class of optimization algorithms by iteratively reducing the size of the dictionary during the optimization process, discarding elements that are provably known not to belong to the solution of the Lasso. The iterative reduction of the dictionary is what we call dynamic screening. As this screening step is inexpensive, the computational cost of the algorithm using our dynamic screening strategy is lower than that of the base algorithm. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data support the relevance of this approach.",2014,2014 22nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
Implication of changing coral communities : do larval traits or habitat features drive variation in density-dependent mortality and recruitment of juvenile reef fish ?,"Many lines of evidence suggest coral communities worldwide are changing rapidly. Responses of coral reef fish populations to such changes will, in part, depend upon how vital demographic rates of fish populations respond to changing coral communities. Our previous work on the reef fish Thalassoma hardwicke suggests the strength of density-dependent mortality (a measure of â€œsite qualityâ€) is heterogeneous in space and time. Here we examine environmental features that might account for spatiotemporal variation in quality, to facilitate more accurate predictions of how T. hardwicke populations might respond to habitat degradation and/or changing coral communities. Two habitat attributesâ€”density of branching coral Pocillopora spp. and presence/absence of territorial damselfish Stegastes nigricansâ€”explained >77% of the variation in site quality. The strength of densitydependent mortality experienced by cohorts of T. hardwicke was consistently weaker at sites where S. nigricans was present, and declined with increasing coverage of Pocillopora. However, further sampling suggests that intrinsic quality of juvenile T. hardwicke covaries with these same habitat attributes: cohorts collected from sites with relatively high cover of Pocillopora had proportionally more lipids and faster otolith growth rates as larvae relative to cohorts collected from reefs with noor low coverage of Pocillopora. We expect that habitat attributes and individual traits both contribute to â€œsite qualityâ€, and suggest that a better understanding of the sources of variation in site quality (i.e., density dependence mediated by habitator individual traits) may be necessary to predict the fates of coral reef fish populations with any reasonable accuracy.",2005,
School Working Papers Series 2002 SWP 2002 / 15 eBusiness Model for Networked Learning,"Traditional distance learning has tended to be an isolated and lonely process for its users. Students received study materials by â€˜snail mailâ€™ and then worked alone on these materials. As information technology improves, however, networked learning on-line learning and flexible learning (all of which can be considered eLearning components) have become popular and offer greater opportunities to connect with others. The impetus for eLearning has also been driven by the emerging emphasis on lifelong learning â€“ learning is now recognised to be essential for all people and at every stage of life. Learning arrangements today, particularly those concerning learning at a distance, rely more on technology, which requires expertise and money and also necessitates a more business-like approach. Courses and programs can be treated as products which can be seen as important resources for learners in a â€˜networked learningâ€™ arrangement. It is essential to have a business model for â€˜networked learningâ€™. With all these elements in mind, we adapt Weill and Vitale's eBusiness model for virtual communities for networked learning in this paper. Introduction Distance learning, flexible learning, on-line learning, networked learning and e-learning are all similar in that they provide a learning environment at a distance. They all require learners who will be involved in a form of independent learning, e.g. self-motivated, self-paced and self-disciplined. The concept of distance learning was first put into practice in 1840 by Sir Issac Pitman using the opportunity of a countrywide mail delivery system. In the 1990s modern technology dramatically increased the possibilities of distance learning (Lau 2000). Three IT professionals have found that online degree programs and skills development courses do not have to be lonely experiences (Goff 2001). Ellis (1996) states that networked learning will not be straightforward to implement. The critical success factors include investments in network hardware, access to networked information resources, staff development and course design. Harasim (1999) stresses the importance of instructional design, Internet technology and course content for success in online learning programs as well as effective learning environment. Glasson (2001) suggests two challenges in e-Education: rethinking roles and rethinking content. Learners are critical and sophisticated when using Internet materials, so the content must be impressive. Therefore in the production of content there is a need for partners with technological skills, as well as partners who can provide capital. It is also suggested that artificial intelligence provides mechanisms which have the potential to support networked learning, both at the organisational and educational level (Stamatis, Kefalas & Kargidis 1999). Westera, Sloep & Gerrissen (2000) use the virtual company as an example of a networked learning environment. As Internet technology becomes increasingly popular, virtual universities have been established to meet the demand (Bergner & Bruegge 1998; Huff & Wade 2000). The private sector is interested in becoming involved in these learning programs, in the hope of increasing its contribution to society, developing a good marketing strategy, obtaining specific and appropriate training for employees and, of course, making a profit. Davis & Botkin (1994) argue that education, which was once the exclusive right of the church, changed into the hands of government and then further into large businesses because it is business itself that is most desperate to train a knowledgeable workforce. The knowledge economy requires lifelong learning, and the private sector will have to shoulder a growing responsibility for learning (Tapscott 1996). All these themes indicate an increased need for a business model for networked learning. In this paper, we adapt Weill and Vitale's eBusiness model for a virtual community and modify it for networked learning. Weill and Vitale's eBusiness model for virtual community Weill & Vitale (2001) state that e-business will change the ways in which all surviving companies do business. They define e-business as: marketing, buying, selling, delivering, servicing and payment for products, services, and information across (non-proprietary) networks linking an enterprise and its prospects, customers, agents, suppliers, competitors, allies, and complementors. (Weill & Vitale 2001:5) Nowadays businesses have been quick to recognise the potential value of virtual communities as a way of enhancing their e-business efforts. A virtual community: creates and facilitates an online community of people with a common interest, enabling interaction and service provision. (Weill & Vitale 2001:21) In the eBusiness model for Virtual Community (see Figure 1), the Firm of Interest (also the sponsor of the Virtual Community) is between the members of the community and its suppliers. Fundamental to the success of this model is that members are able to communicate with one another directly. Communication between members may be via email, bulletin boards, online chat, or web-based conferencing, which are the distinguishing features of this model. Virtual communities are positioned to benefit strongly from the â€˜network effectâ€™ (Mooreâ€™s Law), by which athecommunity becomes more valuable as more members are involved. Figure 1. Virtual Community Atomic eBusiness Model Schematic Reproduced from Weill & Vitale (2000: 204) eBusiness model for networked learning Networked learning relies on delivery technology and content. Courses and educational programs can to a large extent be seen as a â€˜service productâ€™ (Chan and Swatman 2000; Swatman and Chan 2001). Researchers have studied networked learning using a variety of theoretical concepts and research methods, but no general business model has yet been produced. An eBusiness model for networked learning is essential for this â€˜e-ageâ€™. We therefore adapt and modify Weill & Vitaleâ€™s eBusiness model for the virtual community to suit networked learning (see Figure 2). Figure 2. eBusiness Model for Networked Learning Adapted and modified from Weill & Vitale (2000: 204) Networked Learning emphasises a technology network and a network of people, ideas and discussions. Networked Learning uses the educational model of collaborative learning, a learning process which depends on interaction with others and a technology process which allows group interaction with others regardless of time and distance. Networked Learning = Collaborative Learning + Online / Computer Conferencing (Knowledge Ability 2000) There are three participants in our model of networked learning. They are a virtual team, providers and learners. The role of each is explained as follows:",2002,
SURGICAL MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL FOR MIDDLE LEVEL TRAUMATIC TETRAPLEGIA: A case for â€œSurgical Internalisationâ€ of External Splints,"In most places the surgical and rehabilitative management of tetraplegic patients is done on an ad hoc basis. We believe that the best interests of these unfortunate patients can only be served by a comprehensive surgical and rehabilitative management protocol through a dedicated team of professionals. The surgical protocol should be a basic standard programme known to the whole team. Depending on the patient's basic needs, variations to this basic surgical programme could be worked out. We propose a basic surgical programme for the mid-cervical tetraplegic patient in order to get rid of cumbersome external splints during the rehabilitative period. Substituting surgical procedures for external splints has become known as â€œinternalisation of splintsâ€. These include: 1. Motorising elbow extension using an improved bone-to-bone posterior deltoid to triceps tendon transfer. 2. Motorising forearm pronation by rerouting biceps tendon around radius. 3. Motorising thumb and finger extension, using M. brachioradialis. 4. Metacarpophalangcal finger flexion, using flexor digitorum superficialis tendon Zancolli lasso procedure (tenodesis effect). 5. Motorising distal interphalangeal finger joint flexion, using extensor carpi radialis longus transfer. 6. Thumb pinch/adduction against the fingers, rerouting flexor pollicis longus tendon to extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon, end-to-side. 7. Thumb stabilisation procedures on any one or two thumb joints. The above procedures contribute greatly to the independent function of the patient. Careful preoperative assessment and prerequisites include the patientâ€™s needs, patientâ€™s motivation, muscle power and endurance and important â€œtrick movementsâ€.",1996,Hand Surgery
Prior knowledge driven Granger causality analysis on gene regulatory network discovery,"BackgroundOur study focuses on discovering gene regulatory networks from time series gene expression data using the Granger causality (GC) model. However, the number of available time points (T) usually is much smaller than the number of target genes (n) in biological datasets. The widely applied pairwise GC model (PGC) and other regularization strategies can lead to a significant number of false identifications when n>>T.ResultsIn this study, we proposed a new method, viz., CGC-2SPR (CGC using two-step prior Ridge regularization) to resolve the problem by incorporating prior biological knowledge about a target gene data set. In our simulation experiments, the propose new methodology CGC-2SPR showed significant performance improvement in terms of accuracy over other widely used GC modeling (PGC, Ridge and Lasso) and MI-based (MRNET and ARACNE) methods. In addition, we applied CGC-2SPR to a real biological dataset, i.e., the yeast metabolic cycle, and discovered more true positive edges with CGC-2SPR than with the other existing methods.ConclusionsIn our research, we noticed a â€œ 1+1>2â€ effect when we combined prior knowledge and gene expression data to discover regulatory networks. Based on causality networks, we made a functional prediction that the Abm1 gene (its functions previously were unknown) might be related to the yeastâ€™s responses to different levels of glucose. Our research improves causality modeling by combining heterogeneous knowledge, which is well aligned with the future direction in system biology. Furthermore, we proposed a method of Monte Carlo significance estimation (MCSE) to calculate the edge significances which provide statistical meanings to the discovered causality networks.

"La querela: ""strumento"" processuale volto a finalitÃ  deflative piuttosto che alla tutela della vittima del reato. E' questo il traguardo della politica criminale italiana?","EnglishThe art. 1, paragraph 16, of l. n. 103/2017 has placed the complain to the attention of the doctrine. The government has to increase the cases of private claims against person and property offenses. The complain is now a procedural condition and the deflating purpose represents its criminal political foundation. The private initiative in many offenses decreases the importance of the subjective element in the criminal offense. The crisis in the judicial system makes it a real danger of giving up punishment for crimes to avoid the processes. The protection of the community would be more guaranteed by the transformation of criminal offenses in civil lawsuits: this would ensure undoubtedly a deflating effect without a renunciation of the punishment of unlawful conducts. italianoLa querela e un istituto che ha conosciuto alterne vicende e che e tornato allâ€™attenzione del penalista in virtu dellâ€™art. 1, co. 16, della l. n. 103/2017; la norma prevede unâ€™ampia delega al governo per un incremento consistente della perseguibilita a querela dei reati contro la persona ed il patrimonio.

A comparison of Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) diets with net samples of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) taken from the Prydz Bay region,"Samples of the stomach contents of Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica) were obtained on board ship in the Prydz Bay region of Antarctica from birds which had spontaneously regurgitated. The weight of food and the species composition of the stomach contents were measured. Antarctic krill,Euphausia superba, the sole prey item taken, were compared to krill obtained by nets in the same region as part of a large-scale krill survey. Krill from petrel stomach samples were larger in mean size than those sampled by nets. This may be attributed to selection of the larger sized krill by the petrels, it may be caused by the nets sampling different populations of krill or it may be due to net avoidance by the larger krill.",2005,Polar Biology
Adaptive Dantzig density estimation,"The aim of this paper is to build an estimate of an unknown density as a linear combination of functions of a dictionary. Inspired by CandÃ¨s and Taoâ€™s approach, we propose a minimization of the 1-norm of the coefficients in the linear combination under an adaptive Dantzig constraint coming from sharp concentration inequalities. This allows to consider a wide class of dictionaries. Under local or global structure assumptions, oracle inequalities are derived. These theoretical results are transposed to the adaptive Lasso estimate naturally associated to our Dantzig procedure. Then, the issue of calibrating these procedures is studied from both theoretical and practical points of view. Finally, a numerical study shows the significant improvement obtained by our procedures when compared with other classical procedures. RÃ©sumÃ©. Lâ€™objectif de cet article est de construire un estimateur dâ€™une densitÃ© inconnue comme combinaison linÃ©aire de fonctions dâ€™un dictionnaire.

Complete nucleotide sequence and full-length cDNA clone of S.A.AR86 a South African alphavirus related to Sindbis.,"S.A.AR86 and Girdwood S.A., two South African Sindbis-like arboviruses, are closely related antigenically to the Swedish isolate, Ockelbo82 [LundstrÃ¶m, J. O., Vene, S., Saluzzo, J. F., and Niklasson, B. (1993) Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 49(5), 531-537]. Each of these viruses is associated with human disease, and Girdwood S.A. was isolated from a human case. In addition, S.A.AR86 is unique among Sindbis-like viruses in that adult mice remain sensitive to lethal infection with S.A.AR86. The complete genomic sequences of S.A.AR86 and Girdwood S.A. were determined. The S.A.AR86 RNA genome contained 11,663 nucleotides, excluding the 5' CAP structure and 3' poly(A) tail. In comparison to the consensus sequence of the prototype Egyptian Sindbis strain AR339, S.A.AR86 differed at 5.57% of the nucleotides, including a 54-nucleotide deletion, two insertions of 6 nucleotides each, and a 3-nucleotide insertion in the 3' terminal one-third of the S.A.AR86 nsP3 gene. S.A.AR86 is one of only three alphaviruses sequenced to date that does not have an opal termination codon between the nsP3 and the nsP4 genes. These genes are separated by a cysteine codon in the S.A.AR86 genome. The genome of Girdwood S.A. was 11,717 nucleotides in length, excluding the 5' CAP and 3' poly(A) tail. Girdwood S.A. contained an opal termination codon between nsP3 and nsP4 and did not have the large 54-nucleotide deletion in nsP3, although Girdwood S.A. did contain the remaining insertions and deletions characteristic of S.A.AR86. S.A.AR86 was more closely related to Girdwood S.A. than to the Egyptian isolate, and the South African isolates as a group were more closely related to the Swedish isolate. Comparison of the S.A.AR86 sequence to that of Ockelbo82, Girdwood S.A., and Sindbis virus AR339 revealed several codons where S.A.AR86 differed from the conserved amino acid encoded by the other three viruses. These changes may be related to the ability of S.A.AR86 to initiate a lethal central nervous system infection in adult mice. To fulfill a prerequisite for testing this hypothesis, a full-length cDNA clone of S.A.AR86 was constructed from which infectious genomic RNA replicas could be derived. The sequence of this clone differed from the S.A.AR86 genomic RNA sequence at four translationally silent positions, and virus derived from the clone reproduced the adult mouse neurovirulence phenotype of its biological progenitor.",1996,Virology
Management of open information technology and systems (ITS) architectures in the Australian federal government: development of a perspectival model for information systems management,"This thesis looks at the limitations of current ITS management objective (normative) theory and develops a new Perspectival ITS Management Model so as to supplement this theory and overcome some of its limitations. The proposed Perspectival ITS Management Model is an approach to reconciliation/integration of object/subject from a phenomenological viewpoint. The development of the Perspectival ITS Management Model has been heavily influenced by the work of John Haynes (2001a). In order to investigate the applicability of the Perspectival ITS Management Model a constructionist epistemological stance is taken in the thesis, which describes an overview of current objective ITS management theory, that is analysed and focussed through a normative ITS Management Model (developed by the candidate in the early stages of the thesis). The thesis goes on to develop the objective theoretical view of the management of open systems architectures and uses this to investigate the subjective case study accounts of the management of open systems architectures from 1993-1996 in the Australian federal government. These cases are used to highlight how the Perspectival ITS Management Model can be utilised to enhance, extend and transform our understanding of ITS Management in ways that the current body of theory does not. A postscript has also been developed to illustiate how the Perspectival ITS Management Model can also be applied to the ITS management landscape (whole-of-govemment ITS outsourcing) of the Australian federal govenmient (1996 2001) after the initial open systems case study period (1993-1996).

Post-settlement emigration affects mortality estimates for two Bahamian wrasses,"Understanding the dynamics of open marine populations is inherently complex, and this complexity has led to decades of debate regarding the relative importance of pre- versus post-settlement processes in structuring these populations. Movement between patches may be an important modifier of patterns established at settlement, yet local immigration and emigration have received less attention than other demographic rates. I examined loss rates from tagged populations of juvenile wrasses (yellowhead wrasse Halichoeres garnoti and bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum) at two sites in the Bahamas. Assuming that all losses were due solely to mortality would have significantly underestimated survivorship of yellowhead wrasse by 29% and bluehead wrasse by 14%. On average, per capita mortality and emigration rates were higher for yellowhead than bluehead wrasse, but neither demographic rate differed between sites for either species. With respect to within-species density, bluehead wrasse mortality was density-dependent at the patch reef site, but mortality rates of yellowhead wrasse were consistently density-independent. Evaluating the effects of between-species density, yellowhead wrasse mortality increased with a decrease in bluehead wrasse density, but this effect was limited to the patch reef site. Emigration rates were not a function of either within-species or between-species density, but instead varied inversely with isolation distance. Numerous previous studies of coral-reef fish, conducted on patch reefs separated by only a few meters of sand and often using untagged fish, may have confounded losses due to emigration with those due to mortality. A better understanding of the factors affecting emigration in marine fishes is important to their effective management using spatial tools such as marine protected areas.",2005,Coral Reefs
Survival Risk Prediction Models of Gliomas Based on IDH and 1p/19q,"Gliomas have been classified into different molecular subtypes based on their molecular features. To explore the prognostic factors of different subtypes of gliomas, we performed a univariate survival analysis based on the RNA-seq data of 653 patients obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We identified 12205 (20.18%), 6125 (10.13%) and 5206 (8.61%) genes associated with the overall survival (OS) of the IDH-wildtype, IDH-mutation 1p/19q intact and IDH-mutation 1p/19q codeletion gliomas, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that OS related genes were mainly involved in alcoholism, systemic lupus erythematosus, hematopoietic cell lineage and diabetes. The OS related genes were further selected using Lasso regression, and three prognostic risk score models were constructed to effectively predict the OS of the patients with different subtypes of gliomas. In total, 76 signature genes were identified and were selected to construct the three models. Moreover, neither of the 76 genes overlapped between different models, which suggested the enormous difference among the three subtypes, although some signature genes (SERPINA5, RP11.229A12.2 and RP11.62F24.2) were also identified as the OS related genes in different glioma subtypes. Interestingly, five genes (RP11.229A12.2, RP11.62F24.2, C3orf67, RP11.275H4.1 and TBX3) played opposing roles (protective or risk factor) in different subtypes. Additionally, the prognosis models consisted of a substantial proportion of non-coding RNA (58.74%, 70.13% and 58.11% in the IDH-wildtype, IDH-mutation 1p/19q intact and IDH-mutation 1p/19q codeletion). Furthermore, multivariate analysis integrating clinical variables demonstrated that risk group predicted by the prognostic models was an independent prognostic factor for gliomas. In conclusion, we have constructed and validated three models that have the potential to predict the prognosis of glioma patients. The genes and pathways identified in this study require further investigation for their underlying mechanisms and potential clinical significance in improving the OS of the glioma patients.",2020,
Optimizing Quantization for Lasso Recovery,"This letter is focused on quantized compressed sensing, assuming that Lasso is used for signal estimation. Leveraging recent work, we propose a constrained Lloydâ€“Max-like framework to optimize the quantization function in this setting, and show that when the number of observations is high, this method of quantization gives a significantly better recovery rate than standard Lloydâ€“Max quantization. We support our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations.",2018,IEEE Signal Processing Letters
Concave selection in generalized linear models,"A family of concave penalties, including the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and minimax concave penalties (MCP), has been shown to have attractive properties in variable selection. The computation of concave penalized solutions, however, is a difficult task. We propose a majorization minimization by coordinate descent (MMCD) algorithm to compute the solutions of concave penalized generalized linear models (GLM). In contrast to the existing algorithms that uses local quadratic or local linear approximation of the penalty, the MMCD majorizes the negative log-likelihood by a quadratic loss, but does not use any approximation to the penalty. This strategy avoids the computation of scaling factors in iterative steps, hence improves the efficiency of coordinate descent. Under certain regularity conditions, we establish the theoretical convergence property of the MMCD algorithm. We implement this algorithm in a penalized logistic regression model using the SCAD and MCP penalties. Simulation studies and a data example demonstrate that the MMCD works sufficiently fast for the penalized logistic regression in high-dimensional settings where the number of covariates is much larger than the sample size. Grouping structure among predictors exists in many regression applications. We first propose an `2 grouped concave penalty to incorporate such group information in a regression model. The `2 grouped concave penalty performs group selection and includes group Lasso (Yuan and Lin (2006)) as a special case. An efficient algorithm is developed and its theoretical convergence property is established under certain",2012,
Works Title Pierced Lasso Topology Controls Function in Leptin Permalink,"Protein engineering is a powerful tool in drug design and therapeutics, where disulphide bridges are commonly introduced to stabilize proteins. However, these bonds also introduce covalent loops, which are often neglected. These loops may entrap the protein backbone on opposite sides, leading to a â€œknottedâ€ topology, forming a so-called Pierced Lasso (PL). In this elegant system, the â€œknotâ€ is held together with a single disulphide bridge where part of the polypeptide chain is threaded through. The size and position of these covalent loops can be manipulated through protein design in vitro, whereas nature uses polymorphism to switch the PL topology. The PL protein leptin shows genetic modification of an N-terminal residue, adding a third cysteine to the same sequence. In an effort to understand the mechanism of threading of these diverse topologies, we designed three loop variants to mimic the polymorphic sequence. This adds elegance to the system under study, as it allows the generation of three possible covalent loops; they are the original wildtype C-terminal loop protein, the fully circularized unthreaded protein, and the N-terminal loop protein, responsible for different lasso topologies. The size of the loop changes the threading mechanism from a slipknotting to a plugging mechanism, with increasing loop size. Interestingly, the ground state of the native protein structure is largely unaffected, but biological assays show that the activity is maximized by properly controlled dynamics in the threaded state. A threaded topology with proper conformational dynamics is important for receptor interaction and activation of the signaling pathways in vivo. â–  INTRODUCTION Entanglement and knots constantly occur in nature, and in the microworld, knots in DNA and homopolymers are well characterized. The more complex knots seen in proteins are harder to investigate, as proteins are heteropolymers composed of a combination of 20 different amino acids with different biophysical properties. In addition, proteins knots are often found in multimeric proteins, making the characterization of the folding mechanisms more complex. As new knotted topologies and new proteins containing knots are constantly discovered, the investigation of knots in proteins have generated intense interest. Many studies investigating this important class of proteins are becoming available. The main focus has been on the evolutionary origin, the threading mechanismîƒ•how to self-tie a protein chain into a knot, and the biological relevance and implication of a knotted topology in vivo. Efforts to study the fully untied and unfolded chain have shown that the knot remains intact in the unfolded state much longer than was first anticipated. The existence of â€œstableâ€ knots in the unfolded state together with the challenge of defining an unfolded and untied chain from an unfolded and knotted chain makes it complicated to study the untied protein in vitro, leaving the threading mechanism elusive. The main focus has been the depth of the knot and the investigation of different types of knots, from (A) a slipknotted topology, where part of the chain threads through and doubles back, (B) the simplest configuration of a trefoil knot, where the protein backbone crosses the loop three times, to more complicated knots (C) with up to five crossings of the protein backbone. In this work, we investigate loop topology on threading and function, using the elegant system that we discovered in the pleiotropic hormone leptin. This system is analogous to circular permutations where the position of the disulphide bridge actually changes the topology of the protein, changing the threaded elements. Thus, switching the disulphide bridge not only has a local effect but also alters the threading and the overall topology. Additionally, a new N-/C-terminus is introduced that potentially affects the allosteric control and thus the biological activity of the protein. In the PL topologies, the threaded topology is formed by a covalent loop, where part of the polypeptide chain is threaded through, forming what we term a Pierced Lasso (PL) topology (Figure 1). As it is hard to visualize a PL topology in a crystal structure, DabrowskiTumanski et al. developed the LassoProt web server (http:// lassoprot.cent.uw.edu.pl/), which enables analysis of biopolymers with PL topologies. The advantage of a PL topology, compared to other knotted proteins, is that the threaded topology can easily be manipulated, as the oxidation state of the Received: November 15, 2016 Revised: December 27, 2016 Published: December 30, 2016 Article",2017,
Total Variation Minimization for Compressed Sensing with â€œSmoothlyâ€ Varying Covariates,"The LASSO is a variable subset selection procedure in statistical linear regression based on sparsity promoting `1 penalization of the least-squares operator. In many applications, the design matrix has strongly correlated columns which are smoothly evolving with the column index. For such applications, the standard LASSO does not provide satisfactory solutions in practice because some incoherence is often needed for support recovery of sparse vectors. In this paper, we circumvent this problem by using a Total Variation penalty and obtain adaptive confidence intervals for the nonzero components of the signal. The relaxation parameter is calibrated by a new multiscale data acquisition scheme. This approach is illustrated by some simulations results for a source localization problem in a marine environment.",2016,2016 IEEE Intl Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and IEEE Intl Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC) and 15th Intl Symposium on Distributed Computing and Applications for Business Engineering (DCABES)
Three new species of acanthocephalans (Palaeacanthocephala) from marine fishes collected off the East Coast of South Africa.,"Three new species of acanthocephalans are described from marine fishes collected in Sodwana Bay, South Africa: Rhadinorhynchus gerberi n. sp. from Trachinotus botla (Shaw), Pararhadinorhynchus sodwanensis n. sp. from Pomadasys furcatus (Bloch et Schneider) and Transvena pichelinae n. sp. from Thalassoma purpureum (ForsskÃ¥l). Transvena pichelinae n. sp. differs from the single existing species of the genus Transvena annulospinosa Pichelin et Cribb, 2001, by the lower number of longitudinal rows of hooks (10-12 vs 12-14, respectively) and fewer hooks in a row (5 vs 6-8), shorter blades of anterior hooks (55-63 vs 98), more posterior location of the ganglion (close to the posterior margin of the proboscis receptacle vs mid-level of the proboscis receptacle) and smaller eggs (50-58 Ã— 13 Âµm vs 62-66 Ã— 13-19 Âµm). Pararhadinorhynchus sodwanensis n. sp. differs from all known species of the genus by a combination of characters. It closely resembles unidentified species Pararhadinorhynchus sp. sensu Weaver and Smales (2014) in the presence of a similar number of longitudinal rows of hooks on the proboscis (16-18 vs 18) and hooks in a row (11-13 vs 13-14), but differs in the position of the lemnisci (extend to the level of the posterior end of the proboscis receptacle or slightly posterior vs extend to the mid-level of the receptacle), length of the proboscis receptacle (910-1180 Âµm vs 1,460 Âµm) and cement glands (870-880 Âµm vs 335-350 Âµm). Rhadinorhynchus gerberi n. sp. is distinguishable from all its congeners by a single field of 19-26 irregular circular rows of the tegumental spines on the anterior part of the trunk, 10 longitudinal rows of hooks on the proboscis with 29-32 hooks in each row, subterminal genital pore in both sexes, and distinct separation of the opening of the genital pore from the posterior edge of the trunk (240-480 Î¼m) in females. Sequences for the 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA and cox1 genes were generated to molecularly characterise the species and assess their phylogenetic position. This study provides the first report based on molecular evidence for the presence of species of Transvena Pichelin et Cribb, 2001 and Pararhadinorhynchus Johnston et Edmonds, 1947 in African coastal fishes.",2019,Folia parasitologica
Whiteout: Gaussian Adaptive Regularization Noise in Deep Neural Networks,"Noise injection is an off-the-shelf method to mitigate over-fitting in neural networks (NNs). The recent developments in Bernoulli noise injection as implemented in the dropout and shakeout procedures demonstrates the efficiency and feasibility of noise injection in regularizing deep NNs. We propose whiteout, a new regularization technique via injection of adaptive Gaussian noises into a deep NN. Whiteout offers three tuning parameters, offering flexibility during training of NNs. We show that whiteout is associated with a deterministic optimization objective function in the context of generalized linear models with a closed-form penalty term and includes lasso, ridge regression, adaptive lasso, and elastic net as special cases. We also demonstrate that whiteout can be viewed as robust learning of NN model in the presence of small and insignificant perturbations in input and hidden nodes. Compared to dropout, whiteout has better performance when training data of relatively small sizes with the sparsity introduced through the l1 regularization. Compared to shakeout, the penalized objective function in whiteout has better convergence behaviors and has a tighter bound for tail probabilities. We establish theoretically that the noiseperturbed empirical loss function with whiteout converges almost surely to the ideal loss function, and the estimates of NN parameters obtained from minimizing the former loss function are consistent with those obtained from minimizing the ideal loss function. Computationally, whiteout can be incorporated in the back-propagation algorithm and is computationally efficient. The superiority of whiteout over dropout and shakeout in training NNs in classification is demonstrated using the MNIST data. keywords: (adaptive) lasso; elastic net; regularization; robustness; consistency; backpropagation âˆ—Co-first authors â€ Corresponding author email: fang.liu.131@nd.ed 1 ar X iv :1 61 2. 01 49 0v 1 [ st at .M L ] 5 D ec 2 01 6",2016,
Targeting TWIST1 through loss of function inhibits tumorigenicity of human glioblastoma,"TWIST1 (TW) is a bHLH transcription factor (TF) and master regulator of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). InÂ vitro, TW promotes mesenchymal change, invasion, and self-renewal in glioblastoma (GBM) cells. However, the potential therapeutic relevance of TW has not been established through loss-of-function studies in human GBM cell xenograft models. The effects of TW loss of function (gene editing and knockdown) on inhibition of tumorigenicity of U87MG and GBM4 glioma stem cells were tested in orthotopic xenograft models and conditional knockdown in established flank xenograft tumors. RNAseq and the analysis of tumors investigated putative TW-associated mechanisms. Multiple bioinformatic tools revealed significant alteration of ECM, membrane receptors, signaling transduction kinases, and cytoskeleton dynamics leading to identification of PI3K/AKT signaling. We experimentally show alteration of AKT activity and periostin (POSTN) expression inÂ vivo and/or inÂ vitro. For the first time, we show that effect of TW knockout inhibits AKT activity in U87MG cells inÂ vivo independent of PTEN mutation. The clinical relevance of TW and candidate mechanisms was established by analysis of the TCGA and ENCODE databases. TW expression was associated with decreased patient survival and LASSO regression analysis identified POSTN as one of top targets of TW in human GBM. While we previously demonstrated the role of TW in promoting EMT and invasion of glioma cells, these studies provide direct experimental evidence supporting protumorigenic role of TW independent of invasion inÂ vivo and the therapeutic relevance of targeting TW in human GBM. Further, the role of TW driving POSTN expression and AKT signaling suggests actionable targets, which could be leveraged to mitigate the oncogenic effects of TW in GBM.",2018,Molecular Oncology
Food and Drink: Geographical Studies II,"The study of human food and drink from a geographical viewpoint is a specialized sub-field of the overall study of geography. Such studies can be done from many directions, including social and cultural geography, economic geography, environmental geography, historical geography, and political geography. While traditionally, such geographical studies have been limited in number and variety, recently there has been a visible growth in their number and variety, and this development has occurred with geographers around the world. This compendium, the second edition, attempts to widen what the first presented, especially in regard to the developments of such food and drink studies from a more world perspective. It seems probable, too, that this ""new"" trend in food and drink studies from a geographical point of view will continue to stimulate and inspire geographers and many others.A number of different studies have been recorded here. These include books, chapters, articles from scholarly journals, dissertations, and theses. These entries also are written in many languages, though English continues to be the usual language used. TEe organization of this second collection mirrors that of the first. The entries are first arranged by region; general areas, North America, Latin America, Europe and Russia, Africa South of the Sahara, North Africa and Southwest Asia, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australasia. These regional arrangements are then further subdivided into a variety of topical listings. These include Atlases, Texts, and General Studies, Food Production and Agriculture, Meat, Seafood, and Dairy Products, Food, Globalism, and Diffusion, Social Issues and Food, Marketing and Distribution, Restaurants and Food Outlets, Wines and Spirits, Non-Alcoholic Drinks, and Plunger and Famine. Not all of these topical listings had entries found, and thus are not recorded in that case. The entries are arranged alphabetically by author's last name within each sub-category. Where there is more than one entry per author, the earliest publication is listed first, and subsequent publications are listed chronologically after the first entry.Lastly, the author won't claim that the following totally exhausts ""the"" list of all such publications in every possible publication written by a geographer on food or drink. Geographers seem to be wonderfully adept at having their work published in an amazing array of appropriate publications. It is also certain that more such publications will be written in the near and far future, as well.In addition to books, chapters, dissertations, and theses, the following scholarly journals served as sources for entries to this compendium.Acta Universitatis Carolinae, GeographicaAfrican AffairsAfrican Geographical ReviewAmerican Review of Canadian StudiesAmerican Journal of Alternative AgricultureAnnual Report, Research Center for Regional Geography, Hiroshima UniversityAnnals, Japan Association of Economic GeographersAnnals, National Association of Geographers, IndiaAnnals of the Association of American GeographersAntipodeApplied GeographerAreaArkansas Journal of GeographyAsian ProfileAustralian GeographerBritish Food JournalBulletin de lAssociation de Geographes FrancaisBulletin of the Association of North Dakota GeographersCalcutta Geographical ReviewCanadian GeographerChinese Geographical ScienceChiri Kagaku/Geographical SciencesCultural GeographiesDeccan GeographerDie ErdeEastern and Southern African Geographical JournalEcology of Food and NutritionEnvironment and Planning A, B, DEuropean Urban and Regional StudiesEurasian Geography and EconomicsFlorida GeographerFood and FoodwaysFood, Culture, and SocietyFood, Nutrition, and AgricultureFood Research Institute StudiesGeographical AnalysisGeographical BulletinGeographical CompassGeographical JournalGeographical Perspective (India)Geographical Perspectives (USA)Geographical ReviewGeographical Review of IndiaGeographical Review of JapanGeografiska Annaler A, BGeographyGeography ReviewGeojournalGeopoliticsGlobalizationsHealth and PlaceHill GeographerIndian Geographical JournalInterdisciplinary Sciences ReviewsInternational Journal of Health GeographiesIrish GeographyJinbun Chiri/Human GeographyJournal of Cultural GeographyJournal of Economic GeographyJournal of Geographical Sciences (China)Journal of GeographyJournal of Geography and Regional PlanningJournal of Geography in Higher EducationJournal of Intercultural StudiesJournal of Rural StudiesJournal of Southern African AjfairsJournal of the Geographical Association of TanzaniaJournal of the Madras Geographical AssociationJournal of Transport GeographyJournal of Tropical GeographyJournal of Urban EconomicsJournal of Wine ResearchJournal of World Intellectual PropertyKansas GeographerKomoba Studies in Human GeographyLand Degradation and DevelopmentLand Use PolicyLes Cahiers d'Outre MerMalaysian Journal of Tropical GeographyMiddle States GeographerModern ChinaNational GeographerNational Geographical Journal of IndiaNew Zealand GeographerNigerian Geographical JournalNorsk Geografisk TidsskriftNorth Carolina GeographerNorthwestern University Studies in GeographyOpen Geography JournalOriental GeographerPakistan Geographical ReviewPhilippine Geographical JournalPolitical GeographyProceedings of the Applied Geography ConferencesProceedings of the National Academy of ScienceProfessional GeographerProgress in Development StudiesProgress in Human GeographyRegional StudiesRenewable Agriculture and Food SystemsRevista GeograficaRural AfricaRural SystemsScottish Geographical JournalSingapore Journal of Tropical GeographySlavonic and Eastern European ReviewSocial and Cultural GeographerSouth African Geographical JournalSouth Australian Geographical JournalSoutheastern GeographerStreetnotesTanzania Notes and RecordsThe Geographer, AligarhTidjschrift voor Ecnomische en Sociale GeographieTourism GeographiesTransactions, Institute of British GeographersTransactions, Institute of Indian GeographersUrban GeographyUrban StudiesVinifera Wine Growers JournalYearbook, Association of Pacific Coast GeographersZambian Geographical JournalZeitschrift fur WirtschaftsgeographieGeneral StudiesAtlases, Texts, and General WorksBennett, M. â€¦",2016,Material culture

Lad-lasso: Simulation Study of Robust Regression in High Dimensional Data,"The common issues in regression, there are a lot of cases in the condition number of predictor variables more than number of observations ( ) called high dimensional data. The classical problem always lies in this case, that is multicolinearity. It would be worse when the datasets subject to heavy-tailed errors or outliers that may appear in the responses and/or the predictors. As this reason, Wang et al in 2007 developed combined methods from Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) regression that is useful for robust regression, and also LASSO that is popular choice for shrinkage estimation and variable selection, becoming LAD-LASSO. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory using LAD-LASSO in high dimensional datasets that lies outliers better than using LASSO.

Combining multidimensional genomic measurements for predicting cancer prognosis: observations from TCGA,"With accumulating research on the interconnections among different types of genomic regulations, researchers have found that multidimensional genomic studies outperform one-dimensional studies in multiple aspects. Among many sources of multidimensional genomic data, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides the public with comprehensive profiling data on >30 cancer types, making it an ideal test bed for conducting and comparing different analyses. In this article, the analysis goal is to apply several existing methods and associate multidimensional genomic measurements with cancer outcomes in particular prognosis, with special focus on the predictive power of genomic signatures. We exploit clinical data and four types of genomic measurement including mRNA gene expression, DNA methylation, microRNA and copy number alterations for breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, acute myeloid leukemia and lung squamous cell carcinoma collected by TCGA. To accommodate the high dimensionality, we extract important features using Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Squares and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso), which are representative of dimension reduction and variable selection techniques and have been extensively adopted, and fit Cox survival models with combined important features. We calibrate the predictive power of each type of genomic measurement for the prognosis of four cancer types and find that the results vary across cancers. Our analysis also suggests that for most of the cancers in our study and the adopted methods, there is no substantial improvement in prediction when adding other genomic measurement after gene expression and clinical covariates have been included in the model. This is consistent with the findings that molecular features measured at the transcription level affect clinical outcomes more directly than those measured at the DNA/epigenetic level.",2015,Briefings in bioinformatics
A Ranking Approach to Genomic Selection,"BACKGROUND
Genomic selection (GS) is a recent selective breeding method which uses predictive models based on whole-genome molecular markers. Until now, existing studies formulated GS as the problem of modeling an individual's breeding value for a particular trait of interest, i.e., as a regression problem. To assess predictive accuracy of the model, the Pearson correlation between observed and predicted trait values was used.


CONTRIBUTIONS
In this paper, we propose to formulate GS as the problem of ranking individuals according to their breeding value. Our proposed framework allows us to employ machine learning methods for ranking which had previously not been considered in the GS literature. To assess ranking accuracy of a model, we introduce a new measure originating from the information retrieval literature called normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). NDCG rewards more strongly models which assign a high rank to individuals with high breeding value. Therefore, NDCG reflects a prerequisite objective in selective breeding: accurate selection of individuals with high breeding value.


RESULTS
We conducted a comparison of 10 existing regression methods and 3 new ranking methods on 6 datasets, consisting of 4 plant species and 25 traits. Our experimental results suggest that tree-based ensemble methods including McRank, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Regression Trees achieve excellent ranking accuracy. RKHS regression and RankSVM also achieve good accuracy when used with an RBF kernel. Traditional regression methods such as Bayesian lasso, wBSR and BayesC were found less suitable for ranking. Pearson correlation was found to correlate poorly with NDCG. Our study suggests two important messages. First, ranking methods are a promising research direction in GS. Second, NDCG can be a useful evaluation measure for GS.",2015,PLoS ONE
Robust decision making and its applications in machine learning,"Decision making formulated as finding a strategy that maximizes a utility function depends critically on knowing the problem parameters precisely. The obtained strategy can be highly sub-optimal and/or infeasible when parameters are subject to uncertainty, a typical situation in practice. Robust optimization, and more generally robust decision making, addresses this issue by treating uncertain parameters as an arbitrary element of a pre-defined set and solving solutions based on a worst-case analysis. In this thesis we contribute to two closely related fields of robust decision making. 
First, we address two limitations of robust decision making. Namely, a lack of theoretical justification and conservatism in sequential decision making. Specifically, we provide an axiomatic justification of robust optimization based on the MaxMin Expected Utility framework from decision theory. Furthermore, we propose three less conservative decision criteria for sequential decision making tasks, which include: (1) In uncertain Markov decision processes we propose an alternative formulation of the parameter uncertainty â€“ the nested-set structured parameter uncertainty â€“ and find the strategy that achieves maxmin expected utility to mitigate the conservatism of the standard robust Markov decision processes. (2) We investigate uncertain Markov decision processes where each strategy is evaluated comparatively by its gap to the optimum value. Two formulations, namely minimax regret and mean-variance tradeoff of the regret, were proposed and their computational cost studied. (3) We propose a novel Kalman filter design based on trading-off the likely performance and the robustness under parameter uncertainty. 
Second, we apply robust decision making into machine learning both theoretically and algorithmically. Specifically, on the theoretical front, we show that the concept of robustness is essential to â€œsuccessfulâ€ learning. In particular, we prove that both SVM and Lasso are special cases of robust optimization, and such robustness interpretation implies consistency and sparsity naturally. We further establish a more general duality between robustness and generalizability â€“ the former is a necessary and sufficient condition to the latter for an arbitrary learning algorithm â€“ thus providing an answer to the fundamental question of what makes a learning algorithm work. 
On the algorithmic front, we propose novel robust learning algorithms that include (1) a robust classifier with controlled conservatism by extending robust SVM to a soft notion of robustness known as comprehensive robustness; (2) a High-dimensional Robust Principal Component Analysis (HR-PCA) algorithm for reducing dimensionality in the case that outlying observation exists and the dimensionality is comparable to the number of observations.",2009,
Penalized classification using Fisher's linear discriminant.,"We consider the supervised classification setting, in which the data consist of p features measured on n observations, each of which belongs to one of K classes. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical method for this problem. However, in the high-dimensional setting where p â‰« n, LDA is not appropriate for two reasons. First, the standard estimate for the within-class covariance matrix is singular, and so the usual discriminant rule cannot be applied. Second, when p is large, it is difficult to interpret the classification rule obtained from LDA, since it involves all p features. We propose penalized LDA, a general approach for penalizing the discriminant vectors in Fisher's discriminant problem in a way that leads to greater interpretability. The discriminant problem is not convex, so we use a minorization-maximization approach in order to efficiently optimize it when convex penalties are applied to the discriminant vectors. In particular, we consider the use of L(1) and fused lasso penalties. Our proposal is equivalent to recasting Fisher's discriminant problem as a biconvex problem. We evaluate the performances of the resulting methods on a simulation study, and on three gene expression data sets. We also survey past methods for extending LDA to the high-dimensional setting, and explore their relationships with our proposal.",2011,"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

The effect of surface colour on the formation of marine micro and macrofouling communities.,"The effect of substratum colour on the formation of micro- and macro fouling communities was investigated. Acrylic tiles, painted either black or white were covered with transparent sheets in order to ensure similar surface properties. All substrata were exposed to biofouling at 1â€‰m depth for 40â€‰d in the Marina Bandar al Rowdha (Muscat, Sea of Oman). Studies were conducted in 2010 over a time course of 5, 10 and 20â€‰d, and in 2012 samples were collected at 7, 14 and 21â€‰d. The densities of bacteria on the black and white substrata were similar with the exception of day 10, when the black substrata had a higher abundance than white ones. Pyrosequencing via 454 of 16S rRNA genes of bacteria from white and black substrata revealed that Alphaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant groups. SIMPER analysis demonstrated that bacterial phylotypes (uncultured Gammaproteobacteria, Actibacter, Gaetbulicola, Thalassobius and Silicibacter) and the diatoms (Navicula directa, Navicula sp. and Nitzschia sp.) contributed to the dissimilarities between communities developed on white and black substrata. At day 20, the highest amount of chlorophyll a was recorded in biofilms developed on black substrata. SIMPER analysis showed that Folliculina sp., Ulva sp. and Balanus amphitrite were the major macro fouling species that contributed to the dissimilarities between the communities formed on white and black substrata.

"Description of Litoreibacter meonggei sp. nov., isolated from the sea squirt Halocynthia roretzi, reclassification of Thalassobacter arenae as Litoreibacter arenae comb. nov. and emended description of the genus Litoreibacter Romanenko et al. 2011.","A Gram-negative, non-motile and coccoid, ovoid or rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated MA1-1(T), was isolated from a sea squirt (Halocynthia roretzi) collected from the South Sea, Korea. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain MA1-1(T) is phylogenetically closely related to Litoreibacter species and to Thalassobacter arenae. It exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 97.3, 97.1 and 97.3% to the type strains of Litoreibacter albidus, Litoreibacter janthinus and T. arenae, respectively. Strain MA1-1(T) contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone and C(18:1)Ï‰7c as the predominant fatty acid. The polar lipid profile of strain MA1-1(T) was similar to those of the type strains of L. albidus and L. janthinus. T. arenae was found to be phylogenetically and chemotaxonomically more closely related to Litoreibacter species and strain MA1-1(T) than to Thalassobacter stenotrophicus, the type species of the genus Thalassobacter. The DNA G+C content of strain MA1-1(T) was 57.9 mol%, and DNA-DNA relatedness to the type strains of the two Litoreibacter species and T. arenae was 9-14%. Differential phenotypic properties, together with the observed phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness, distinguished strain MA1-1(T) from the two Litoreibacter species and T. arenae. On the basis of the data presented, strain MA1-1(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Litoreibacter, for which the name Litoreibacter meonggei sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MA1-1(T) (â€Š=â€ŠKCTC 23699(T) â€Š=â€ŠCCUG 61486(T)).

On Model Parallelization and Scheduling Strategies for Distributed Machine Learning,"Distributed machine learning has typically been approached from a data parallel perspective, where big data are partitioned to multiple workers and an algorithm is executed concurrently over different data subsets under various synchronization schemes to ensure speed-up and/or correctness. A sibling problem that has received relatively less attention is how to ensure efficient and correct model parallel execution of ML algorithms, where parameters of an ML program are partitioned to different workers and undergone concurrent iterative updates. We argue that model and data parallelisms impose rather different challenges for system design, algorithmic adjustment, and theoretical analysis. In this paper, we develop a system for model-parallelism, STRADS, that provides a programming abstraction for scheduling parameter updates by discovering and leveraging changing structural properties of ML programs. STRADS enables a flexible tradeoff between scheduling efficiency and fidelity to intrinsic dependencies within the models, and improves memory efficiency of distributed ML. We demonstrate the efficacy of model-parallel algorithms implemented on STRADS versus popular implementations for topic modeling, matrix factorization, and Lasso.",2014,
"The corepressor N-CoR and its variants RIP13a and RIP13Delta1 directly interact with the basal transcription factors TFIIB, TAFII32 and TAFII70.","Repression of transcription by the classical nuclear receptors (e.g. TR, RAR), the orphan nuclear receptors (e.g. Rev-erbAalpha/beta), Mxi-1 and Mad bHLH-zip proteins and the oncoproteins PLZF and LAZ3/BCL6 is mediated by the corepressors N-CoR and SMRT. The interaction of the corepressors with the components involved in chromatin remodelling, such as the recruiting proteins Sin3A/B and the histone deacteylases HDAc-1 and RPD3, has been analysed in detail. The N-CoR/Sin3/HDAc complexes have a key role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. However, the interaction of these corepressors with the basal transcriptional machinery has remained obscure. In this study we demonstrated that the N-terminalrepression domains and the receptor interactiondomains (RID) of N-CoR and its splice variants, RIP13a and RIP13Delta1, directly interact with TAFII32 in vivo and in vitro . We show that interaction domain II within the N-CoR and RIP13a RID is required for the interaction with TAFII32. We also observed that N-CoR directly interacts with each of the basal factors, TFIIB and TAFII70, and can simultaneously interact with all three basal factors in a non-competitive manner. Furthermore, we provide evidence that suggests the RVR/Rev-erbbeta-corepressor complex also interacts with the general transcriptional machinery, and that the physicalassociation of TFIIB with N-CoR also occurs in the presence of Sin3B and HDAc-1. Interestingly, we observed that N-CoR expression ablated the functional interaction between TFIIB and TAFII32 that is critical to the initiation of transcription. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the N-terminal repressor region and the C-terminal RIDs are part of the corepressor contact interface that mediates the interaction with the general transcription factors, and demonstrates that TAFs can also directly interact with corepressors to mediate signals from repressors to the basal machinery. We also suggest that N-CoR interacts with the central components of the transcriptional initiation process (TFIIB, TAFs) and locks them into a non-functional complex or conformation that is not conducive to transcription.",1998,Nucleic acids research
Prediction of multiple infections after severe burn trauma: a prospective cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE
To develop predictive models for early triage of burn patients based on hypersusceptibility to repeated infections.


BACKGROUND
Infection remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity after severe trauma, demanding new strategies to combat infections. Models for infection prediction are lacking.


METHODS
Secondary analysis of 459 burn patients (â‰¥16 years old) with 20% or more total body surface area burns recruited from 6 US burn centers. We compared blood transcriptomes with a 180-hour cutoff on the injury-to-transcriptome interval of 47 patients (â‰¤1 infection episode) to those of 66 hypersusceptible patients [multiple (â‰¥2) infection episodes (MIE)]. We used LASSO regression to select biomarkers and multivariate logistic regression to built models, accuracy of which were assessed by area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and cross-validation.


RESULTS
Three predictive models were developed using covariates of (1) clinical characteristics; (2) expression profiles of 14 genomic probes; (3) combining (1) and (2). The genomic and clinical models were highly predictive of MIE status [AUROCGenomic = 0.946 (95% CI: 0.906-0.986); AUROCClinical = 0.864 (CI: 0.794-0.933); AUROCGenomic/AUROCClinical P = 0.044]. Combined model has an increased AUROCCombined of 0.967 (CI: 0.940-0.993) compared with the individual models (AUROCCombined/AUROCClinical P = 0.0069). Hypersusceptible patients show early alterations in immune-related signaling pathways, epigenetic modulation, and chromatin remodeling.


CONCLUSIONS
Early triage of burn patients more susceptible to infections can be made using clinical characteristics and/or genomic signatures. Genomic signature suggests new insights into the pathophysiology of hypersusceptibility to infection may lead to novel potential therapeutic or prophylactic targets.",2015,Annals of surgery
"Allenbatrachus, A New Genus of Indo-Pacific Toadfish (Batrachoididae)","Allenbatrachus is described as a new genus for two Indo-West Pacific species previously known as Batrichthys grunniens (Linnaeus, 1758) and Batrachus reticulatus (Steindachner, 1870). It is included in the subfamily Batrachoidinae and is separated from other genera on the basis of the following combination ofcharacters: a dorsocranium foramen behind each eye; two subopercular spines; no pectoral-fin axil foramina; raised flange on dorsal surface of maxilla; and protruding lower jaw. The two species of Allenbatrachus are redescribed and a neotype designated for Batrachus reticulatus. NEARSHORE COLLECTIONS FROM the Indo-Australian Archipelago to the Ganges River area of India may yield two species of toadfish that lack a foramen in the pectoral-fin axil. One of these species has been identified as Batrichthys grunniens by Hutchins (1981). The second species has masqueraded under the name of B. grunniens, but in fact is the species described as Batrachus reticulatus by Steindachner (1870); it has blunt, rounded teeth rather than the pointed teeth of Batrichthys grunniens. Hutchins (1981) unraveled the complex nomenclature of the toadfish species of India and correctly determined that the species described by Linnaeus (1758) as Cottus grunniens had priority over Batrachoides gangene described by Hamilton (1822). Hutchins followed Menon (1963) in utilizing South African genera (Smith 1952) for the Indian species he treated and placed grunniens in the genus Batrichthys; however, he commented that of the recognized batrachoidid genera, ""... none is apparently suitable for either of the above two Indian species."" As part of a revision of the batrachoidid genera, I have cleared and stained representatives of all described genera in the family. Examination of this material has demonstrated that Hutchins' misgivings about the use of the genus Batrichthys for grunniens is correct and neither grunniens nor reticulatus can be included in that I Manuscript accepted 10 October 1996. 2 Department ofZoology and Hawai 'i Institute ofMarine Biology, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, 2538 The Mall, Honolulu, Hawaj 'j 96822. genus or any other toadfish genus. The genus Allenbatrachus is described here for these two species. Three subfamilies of toadfishes are recognized: Thalassophryninae (Thalassophryne, Daector); Porichthyinae (Aphos, Porichthys); and Batrachoidinae (18 currently recognized genera including Allenbatrachus) (Smith 1952). The Thalassophryninae have two venomous, hollow, dorsal-fin spines; two venomous, hollow, opercular spines; no subopercular spines; and accessory upper pectoral-fin radial only slightly expanded distally. The Porichthyinae also have two dorsal-fin and two opercular spines, but not hollow and not venomous; lack subopercular spines; and distal end of accessory upper pectoral-fin radial is broadly expanded. The Batrachoidinae have three solid dorsal-fin spines; three solid opercular spines; lack venom glands; have one to three subopercular spines; and accessory upper pectoral-fin radial is rodlike or only slightly expanded distally. MATERIALS AND METHODS All counts and measurements follow Hubbs and Lagler (1964) except that the last two fin rays are not counted as one unless it is clear that they are joined at the base.

"Salsuginibacillus kocurii gen. nov., sp. nov., a moderately halophilic bacterium from soda-lake sediment.","A Gram-positive, endospore-forming, alkali-tolerant, moderately halophilic bacterium, designated strain CH9d(T), was isolated from the sediment of Lake Chagannor in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. The cells were rod-shaped and motile. Isolate CH9d(T) grew at pH 5.8-10.0 (optimally at pH 8.5), at salinities of 3-20 % (w/v) marine salts (optimally at 10.0 %, w/v) and between 20 and 50 degrees C (optimally at 37 degrees C). The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and the major respiratory isoprenoid quinone was MK-7. The predominant cellular fatty acids of strain CH9d(T) were anteiso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(17 : 0), iso-C(17 : 0) and iso-C(15 : 0) and its polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and two unknown phospholipids. The G+C content of the DNA was 44.7 mol%. Strain CH9d(T) exhibited a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity value of only 91 % with respect to Thalassobacillus devorans DSM 16966(T) and showed values below 91 % with respect to members of the genera Bacillus, Halobacillus and Marinococcus. Strain CH9d(T) could be clearly differentiated from its closest phylogenetic neighbours on the basis of several phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic features. Therefore, data from the polyphasic study support the placement of strain CH9d(T) in a novel genus and species, for which the name Salsuginibacillus kocurii gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

Taking the district of Schleswig-Flensburg as an example, the collaboration and information exchange between health and food control authorities is described. The Ministry of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Areas of Schleswig-Holstein (MLUR) received the first information about clusters of disorders with symptoms of bloody diarrhoea and HUS from the districts around Hamburg and the city of Hamburg on 19 May 2011. On the same day, the veterinary services and the service for consumer protection in the district of Schleswig-Flensburg were informed about a situation comparable to the one in the environment of Hamburg. Due to this situation, official procedures were initiated to discover the origins of this food-associated outbreak - both at the state and county level and in collaboration with the health authorities. On 1 June 2011, an initial telephone conference was held between the responsible ministries and the food inspection and health authorities of the counties and cities in order to coordinate a joint action. On 3 June 2011, the National Task Force EHEC was founded at the Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) in Berlin. By founding the National Task Force EHEC, the coordination of the clearing process was passed over to the BVL two weeks after the public health authorities had knowledge of accumulated and cross-border cases. On 7 June 2011 an employee of the district Schleswig-Flensburg was sent to the Task Force EHEC in Berlin by the MLUR. The lesson to be learned as a result of the EHEC O104:H4 outbreak is that among the â€œdangerous foodsâ€ there are more plant-based foods than often assumed. In the future this must be much more taken into account.",2011,Journal fÃ¼r Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit
Abstract LB-357: Efficient identification of tumor of unknown primary origin by its microRNA profile,"Proceedings: AACR 101st Annual Meeting 2010â€â€ Apr 17â€21, 2010; Washington, DC

Background: Carcinomas of unknown primary origin (CUP) constitute 3-5% of all newly diagnosed metastatic cancers, the primary source of which is hard to classify with current histological methods, often because CUPs are poorly differentiated. Since effective cancer treatment depends on early and proper identification of the tumor, CUP patients have poor prognosis and short survival rates. Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs play an important role in the initiation and progression of cancer, and because the expression of microRNAs is highly tissue specific, the microRNA profile of an unknown tumor can be used to identify its tissue of origin. Here, we present a microRNA based classifier, which based on a sample's microRNA profile, can predict its tissue origin with high accuracy.

Methods: Total RNA was extracted from 1115 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples, and subjected to expression analysis on an LNA (Locked Nucleic Acid) enhanced microarray platform, which allows for very sensitive and specific detection of 2090 microRNAs. Based on the microRNA expression profiles, we tested and cross-validated several classification algorithms, including KNN (K nearest neighbors), LDA (linear discriminant analysis), SVM (support vector machines) and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) to assess, which method is best suited for the current multiclass classification task.

Results: The currently best classifier for tumors of unknown primary origin is based on the LASSO algorithm, which consistently is able to identify 15 different tumor histologies with 90% or higher accuracy based on a small set of microRNAs. We are currently assessing the classifier's performance on true unknown primary tumors, where the correct diagnosis has been obtained at autopsy.

Reconstitution of a chemical defense signaling pathway in a heterologous system.,"Chemical signaling plays an important role in ecological interactions, such as communication and predator-prey dynamics. Since sessile species cannot physically escape predators, many contain compounds that deter predation; however, it is largely unknown how predators physiologically detect deterrent chemicals. Few studies have investigated ecologically relevant aversive taste responses in any predator. Our objective was to determine if a signaling pathway for detecting marine sponge-derived deterrent compounds could be reconstituted in a heterologous expression system to ultimately facilitate investigation of the molecular mechanism of such an aversive behavioral response. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) rejected artificial diets laced with sponge chemical defense compounds that were previously shown to deter a generalist marine predator, Thalassoma bifasciatum, suggesting that zebrafish can recognize deterrent compounds relevant to coral reef systems. Transcripts made from a zebrafish cDNA library were expressed in a heterologous system, Xenopus laevis oocytes, and tested for chemoreceptor activation via electrophysiology, using the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) as a reporter. Oocytes expressing gene sequences from the library and CFTR exhibited a CFTR-like electrophysiological response to formoside and ectyoplasides A and B, sponge defense compounds. Therefore, the chemical defense-activated signaling pathway can be reconstituted in Xenopus oocytes. Kinetics of the responses suggested that the responses to formoside and ectyoplasides A and B were receptor-mediated and capable of using the G(alphas) signaling pathway in this system. This bioassay has the potential to lead to the identification of genes that encode receptors capable of interacting with deterrent chemicals, which would enable understanding of predator detection of chemical defenses.",2008,The Journal of experimental biology
"Enamel drilling for canine traction: Advantages, disadvantages, description of surgical technique and biomechanics","Introduction: The management of unerupted teeth has always been considered as a challenging procedure in orthodontic practice. Within this perspective, the search for effectiveness in the procedures adopted for the management of unerupted teeth is essential, which explains the purpose of the present paper. When enamel drilling is performed, a natural structure is transfixed, which may be restored with composite material and may dispense from risky procedures such as bonding attachment technique and lasso wire technique. Objective: The present paper aims to present protocols for enamel drilling for canine traction (EDCT), specifically for maxillary canines, the most frequent teeth showing tooth position anomalies. In this paper, clinical cases with different degrees of complexities were illustrated, and, based upon the literature review and the 30 years of expertise with high rate of clinical success, advantages and disadvantages are discussed comparing EDCT and accessory bonding for canine traction (ABCT).",2011,
Effect of genotype imputation on genome-enabled prediction of complex traits: an empirical study with mice data,"BackgroundGenotype imputation is an important tool for whole-genome prediction as it allows cost reduction of individual genotyping. However, benefits of genotype imputation have been evaluated mostly for linear additive genetic models. In this study we investigated the impact of employing imputed genotypes when using more elaborated models of phenotype prediction. Our hypothesis was that such models would be able to track genetic signals using the observed genotypes only, with no additional information to be gained from imputed genotypes.ResultsFor the present study, an outbred mice population containing 1,904 individuals and genotypes for 1,809 pre-selected markers was used. The effect of imputation was evaluated for a linear model (the Bayesian LASSO - BL) and for semi and non-parametric models (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces regressions â€“ RKHS, and Bayesian Regularized Artificial Neural Networks â€“ BRANN, respectively). The RKHS method had the best predictive accuracy. Genotype imputation had a similar impact on the effectiveness of BL and RKHS. BRANN predictions were, apparently, more sensitive to imputation errors. In scenarios where the masking rates were 75% and 50%, the genotype imputation was not beneficial. However, genotype imputation incorporated information about important markers and improved predictive ability, especially for body mass index (BMI), when genotype information was sparse (90% masking), and for body weight (BW) when the reference sample for imputation was weakly related to the target population.ConclusionsIn conclusion, genotype imputation is not always helpful for phenotype prediction, and so it should be considered in a case-by-case basis. In summary, factors that can affect the usefulness of genotype imputation for prediction of yet-to-be observed traits are: the imputation accuracy itself, the structure of the population, the genetic architecture of the target trait and also the model used for phenotype prediction.",2014,BMC Genetics
Improving conditional random field model for prediction of protein-RNA residue-base contacts,"BackgroundFor understanding biological cellular systems, it is important to analyze interactions between protein residues and RNA bases. A method based on conditional random fields (CRFs) was developed for predicting contacts between residues and bases, which receives multiple sequence alignments for given protein and RNA sequences, respectively, and learns the model with many parameters involved in relationships between neighboring residue-base pairs by maximizing the pseudo likelihood function.MethodsIn this paper, we proposed a novel CRF-based model with more complicated dependency relationships between random variables than the previous model, but which takes less parameters for the sake of avoidance of overfitting to training data.ResultsWe performed cross-validation experiments for evaluating the proposed model, and took the average of AUC (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) scores. The result suggests that the proposed CRF-based model without using L1-norm regularization (lasso) outperforms the existing model with and without the lasso under several input observations to CRFs.ConclusionsWe proposed a novel stochastic model for predicting protein-RNA residue-base contacts, and improved the prediction accuracy in terms of the AUC score. It implies that more dependency relationships in a CRF could be controlled by less parameters.",2018,Quantitative Biology
Minimax regularization.,"Classical approach to regularization is to design norms enhancing smoothness or sparsity and then to use this norm or some power of this norm as a regularization function. The choice of the regularization function (for instance a power function) in terms of the norm is mostly dictated by computational purpose rather than theoretical considerations. In this work, we design regularization functions that are motivated by theoretical arguments. To that end we introduce a concept of optimal regularization called ""minimax regularization"" and, as a proof of concept, we show how to construct such a regularization function for the $\ell_1^d$ norm for the random design setup. We develop a similar construction for the deterministic design setup. It appears that the resulting regularized procedures are different from the one used in the LASSO in both setups.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
"CorrelaÃ§Ã£o entre grau de conversÃ£o, microdureza e conteÃºdo inorgÃ¢nico em compÃ³sitos","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between degree of conversion and microhardness in dental composites, as well as the effect of the inorganic content and type of photo-curing unit on these parameters. Three indirect composites (ArtglassO, SolidexO and Zeta LCO) were polymerized by means of three different laboratorial units (UniXSO, SolidiliteO and an experimental device). For each material, fifteen samples were prepared using a metal matrix. The degree of conversion was analyzed by means of infrared spectroscopy, and microhardness was also assessed. The inorganic content was measured by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The PearsonÂ’s test was carried out in order to determine correlations. The degree of conversion of ArtglassO ranged from 37.5% to 79.2%, and its microhardness, from 32.4 to 50.3 (rÂ =Â 0.904). The degree of conversion of SolidexO ranged from 41.2% to 60.4%, and its microhardness, from 33.3 to 44.1 (rÂ =Â 0.707). The degree of conversion and the microhardness of Zeta LCO ranged from 62.0% to 78.0% and from 22.6 to 33.6, respectively (rÂ =Â 0.710). It was concluded that the utilization of different photo-curing units caused variations on the degree of conversion, as a result of specific characteristics of each unit. For each material, there was strong correlation between the degree of conversion and microhardness. In addition, when different materials were compared, microhardness was more affected by filler content than by the degree of conversion.",2002,Pesquisa OdontolÃ³gica Brasileira

A Comparative Study on the Efficacy of Covered Metal Stent and Plastic Stent in Unresectable Malignant Biliary Obstruction,"BACKGROUND/AIMS
The placement of self expandable metal stent (SEMS) is one of the palliative therapeutic options for patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a covered SEMS versus the conventional plastic stent.


METHODS
We retrospectively evaluated 44 patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction who were treated with a covered SEMS (21 patients) or a plastic stent (10 Fr, 23 patients). We analyzed the technical success rate, functional success rate, early complications, late complications, stent patency and survival rate.


RESULTS
There was one case in the covered SEMS group that had failed technically, but was corrected successfully using lasso. Functional success rates were 90.5% in the covered SEMS group and 91.3% in the plastic stent group. There was no difference in early complications between the two groups. Median patency of the stent was significantly prolonged in patients who had a covered SEMS (233.6 days) compared with those who had a plastic stent (94.6 days) (p=0.006). During the follow-up period, stent occlusion occurred in 11 patients of the covered SEMS group. Mean survival showed no significant difference between the two groups (covered SEMS group, 236.9 days; plastic stent group, 222.3 days; p=0.182).

On l1 mean and variance filtering,"This paper addresses the problem of segmenting a time-series with respect to changes in the mean value or in the variance. The first case is when the time data is modeled as a sequence of independent and normal distributed random variables with unknown, possibly changing, mean value but fixed variance. The main assumption is that the mean value is piecewise constant in time, and the task is to estimate the change times and the mean values within the segments. The second case is when the mean value is constant, but the variance can change. The assumption is that the variance is piecewise constant in time, and we want to estimate change times and the variance values within the segments. To find solutions to these problems, we will study an l1 regularized maximum likelihood method, related to the fused lasso method and l1 trend filtering, where the parameters to be estimated are free to vary at each sample. To penalize variations in the estimated parameters, the l1-norm of the time difference of the parameters is used as a regularization term. This idea is closely related to total variation denoising. The main contribution is that a convex formulation of this variance estimation problem, where the parametrization is based on the inverse of the variance, can be formulated as a certain l1 mean estimation problem. This implies that results and methods for mean estimation can be applied to the challenging problem of variance segmentation/estimation.",2011,"2011 Conference Record of the Forty Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (ASILOMAR)"
Adaptive group LASSO selection in quantile models,"The paper considers a linear model with grouped explanatory variables. If the model errors are not with zero mean and bounded variance or if model contains outliers, then the least squares framework is not appropriate. Thus, the quantile regression is an interesting alternative. In order to automatically select the relevant variable groups, we propose and study here the adaptive group LASSO quantile estimator. We establish the sparsity and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator in two cases: fixed number and divergent number of variable groups. Numerical study by Monte Carlo simulations confirms the theoretical results and illustrates the performance of the proposed estimator.",2016,Statistical Papers
Model-assisted inference for treatment effects using regularized calibrated estimation with high-dimensional data,"Consider the problem of estimating average treatment effects when a large number of covariates are used to adjust for possible confounding through outcome regression and propensity score models. The conventional approach of model building and fitting iteratively can be difficult to implement, depending on ad hoc choices of what variables are included. In addition, uncertainty from the iterative process of model selection is complicated and often ignored in subsequent inference about treatment effects. We develop new methods and theory to obtain not only doubly robust point estimators for average treatment effects, which remain consistent if either the propensity score model or the outcome regression model is correctly specified, but also model-assisted confidence intervals, which are valid when the propensity score model is correctly specified but the outcome regression model may be misspecified. With a linear outcome model, the confidence intervals are doubly robust, that is, being also valid when the outcome model is correctly specified but the propensity score model may be misspecified. Our methods involve regularized calibrated estimators with Lasso penalties, but carefully chosen loss functions, for fitting propensity score and outcome regression models. We provide high-dimensional analysis to establish the desired properties of our methods under comparable conditions to previous results, which give valid confidence intervals when both the propensity score and outcome regression are correctly specified. We present a simulation study and an empirical application which confirm the advantages of the proposed methods compared with related methods based on regularized maximum likelihood estimation.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
CS Sparse K-means: An Algorithm for Cluster-Specific Feature Selection in High-Dimensional Clustering,"Feature selection is an important and challenging task in high dimensional clustering. For example, in genomics, there may only be a small number of genes that are differentially expressed, which are informative to the overall clustering structure. Existing feature selection methods, such as Sparse K-means, rarely tackle the problem of accounting features that can only separate a subset of clusters. In genomics, it is highly likely that a gene can only define one subtype against all the other subtypes or distinguish a pair of subtypes but not others. In this paper, we propose a K-means based clustering algorithm that discovers informative features as well as which cluster pairs are separable by each selected features. The method is essentially an EM algorithm, in which we introduce lasso-type constraints on each cluster pair in the M step, and make the E step possible by maximizing the raw cross-cluster distance instead of minimizing the intra-cluster distance. The results were demonstrated on simulated data and a leukemia gene expression dataset.",2019,ArXiv
"Short-term, Long-term, Social and Spatial Effects of Incentives for Pro-social Behavior: Micro Evidence from a Natural Field Experiment","We present evidence from a natural field experiment involving nearly 100,000 individuals on the mechanisms through which offering economic incentives affects pro-social behavior. Subjects offered $5, $10 and $15 gift cards to donate blood were more likely to donate, and more so the higher the reward value. The incentives had a stronger effect on older subjects, on those who had donated more often and more recently, and those with stronger extrinsic motivation; we detected no heterogeneity across gender or blood type. We also find evidence of a social spillover effect whereby subjects who were offered incentives motivated others to donate. Subjects were also more likely to spatially and temporally alter the location of their donations towards the drives offering rewards. However, the temporal effect only reduced donations immediately after the reward offer was removed but did not cause any long-term change in donations. We also find no evidence of reciprocity: subjects who received a reward by surprise were less likely to donate after the intervention than subjects who received no reward. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding and motivating pro-social behavior. * This is a revised version of a paper that was circulated with the title â€œRewarding Altruism?

Variable selection in single index varying coefficient models with LASSO,"VARIABLE SELECTION IN SINGLE IDNEX VARYING COEFFICIENT MDOELS WITH LASSO September 2015 PENG WANG, B.S., UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF CHINA Ph.D., UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST Directed by: Professor Anna Liu Single index varying coefficient model is a very attractive statistical model due to its ability to reduce dimensions and easy-of-interpretation. There are many theoretical studies and practical applications with it, but typically without features of variable selection, and no public software is available for solving it. Here we propose a new algorithm to fit the single index varying coefficient model, and to carry variable selection in the index part with LASSO. The core idea is a two-step scheme which alternates between estimating coefficient functions and selecting-and-estimating the single index. Both in simulation and in application to a Geoscience dataset, we showed that it works very well. We also presented our R package sivcm with the algorithm implemented and with ideas that can be extended beyond.",2015,
Attitudes of women and men toward contraception in a town in Burkina Faso.,Despite the great influx of data from the World Fertility Surveys the extent of knowledge and practice of contraception in African populations remains hard to evaluate and the impact of contraception on fertility levels is difficult to measure. It is often assumed that the widespread use of such traditional methods as breast feeding and abstinence in parts of Africa is evidence of contraceptive practice although they may not be intended as such. This note analyzes new qualitative research from in-depth interviews in Bukina Faso on knowledge and use of contraception and on the different attitudes of women and men toward the spacing and number of children. 80 women and their husbands from a 1981-1984 multiround infant and child mortality survey were re-interviewed for a longer more impressionistic description of their post-partum experience. The interviews concerned the circumstances customs desires and decisions that influence the conception of the next child. Latent motivations for avoiding births are different for men and women and both must be reached by action programs. Men are the decision makers but women seem to have the greatest stake and their say in the matter should increase with education. Traditional spacing behavior remains a primary concern for all. Abstinence is a prescribed mode of behavior and when contraception gets a foothold it will probably be as a substitute for abstinence. The popular interpretation of religion and what is seen as African tradition remain powerful obstacles to the use of contraception. Since both Catholics and Moslems practice abstinence--although not deliberately to avoid conception--it may be possible to change the perception of this method so that it can become a way to educate people about family planning. Contraception is very much seen as a Western import and a culturally diffused behavior. Men often demonstrate a surprising sophistication about it but often see it as a secret that should not be left indiscriminately within the reach of women or be a subject of husband-wife discussions. Knowledge of modern contraception is spreading slowly by nongovernment auspices in Bobo-Dioulasso Burkina Faso.,1986,
The Belgian sandy beach ecosystem: a review,"This paper reviews the available knowledge on sedimentology, hydrodynamics and five major ecosystem components (microphytobenthos, vascular plants, terrestrial arthropods, zoobenthos, and avifauna) of Belgian sandy beaches. It covers the area from the foredunes to the lower foreshore, takes an ecosystem approach to beaches of this specific geographic area. Morphodynamically, Belgian beaches are (ultra-)dissipative, macrotidal, and wide. Characteristic grain sizes are 160â€380 lm. The sand becomes coarser, beach slopes steeper and tidal range smaller towards the south-west, where beaches have also been frequently reshaped by human interference such as nourishment. Beach organisms are highly adapted to this unique environment and can reach high numbers. We show that even on a heavily populated coastline subjected to intense recreational and development pressure, beaches provide critical, yet threatened, habitats. Vascular plants growing near the drift line, on the dry beach and in the embryonic dunes are mostly short-lived and thalassochorous; the most common species include sea rocket (Cakile maritima), prickly saltwort (Salsola kali subsp. kali), and sea sandwort (Honckenya peploides). These zones are habitat to a highly diverse suite of terrestrial arthropods of halobiontic, halophilous and haloxene species; prominent members are sandhoppers (Talitrus saltator) and dipterans (flies). Microphytobenthos, mainly diatoms, is an important primary producer on Belgian beaches but is not well known. The meio- and macrobenthos of Belgian beaches contains specific assemblages such as the Scolelepis squamataâ€“Eurydice pulchra community of the upper intertidal zone. Birds no longer nest on the beaches itself, but Belgian sandy shores continue to function as important resting and foraging areas for birds such as the sanderling Calidris alba. We identify several human pressures on the beach ecosystems arising from recreation, beach management and fisheries.",2008,Marine Ecology
Factors associated with performing tuberculosis screening of HIV-positive patients in Ghana: LASSO-based predictor selection in a large public health data set,"BackgroundThe purpose of this study is to propose the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operators procedure (LASSO) as an alternative to conventional variable selection models, as it allows for easy interpretation and handles multicollinearities. We developed a model on the basis of LASSO-selected parameters in order to link associated demographical, socio-economical, clinical and immunological factors to performing tuberculosis screening in HIV-positive patients in Ghana.MethodsApplying the LASSO method and multivariate logistic regression analysis on a large public health data set, we selected relevant predictors related to tuberculosis screening.ResultsOne Thousand Ninety Five patients infected with HIV were enrolled into this study with 691 (63.2Â %) of them having tuberculosis screening documented in their patient folders. Predictors found to be significantly associated with performance of tuberculosis screening can be classified into factors related to the clinicianâ€™s perception of the clinical state, as well as those related to PLHIVâ€™s awareness. These factors include newly diagnosed HIV infections (nâ€‰=â€‰354 (32.42Â %), aOR 1.84), current CD4+ T cell count (aOR 0.92), non-availability of HIV type (nâ€‰=â€‰787 (72.07Â %), aOR 0.56), chronic cough (nâ€‰=â€‰32 (2.93Â %), aOR 5.07), intake of co-trimoxazole (nâ€‰=â€‰271 (24.82Â %), aOR 2.31), vitamin supplementation (nâ€‰=â€‰220 (20.15Â %), aOR 2.64) as well as the use of mosquito bed nets (nâ€‰=â€‰613 (56.14Â %), aOR 1.53).ConclusionsAccelerated TB screening among newly diagnosed HIV-patients indicates that application of the WHO screening form for intensifying tuberculosis case finding among HIV-positive individuals in resource-limited settings is increasingly adopted. However, screening for TB in PLHIV is still impacted by clinicianâ€™s perception of patientâ€™s health state and PLHIVâ€™s health awareness. Education of staff, counselling of PLHIV and sufficient financing are needed for further improvement in implementation of TB screening for all PLHIV.

Cardiac magnetic resonance of acute atrial ablation injury - impact of catheter-myocardium contact force,"Background Catheter-myocardium contact force (CF) is a major determinant of ablation lesion generation in the atrium, with higher CF associated with greater energy transfer. Previous publications have suggested that acute atrial injury can be visualized with T2-weighted (T2W) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). This study therefore sought to compare T2W images of acute ablation lesions created at low and high CF. Methods Under general anesthesia, femoral venous access was obtained in eight male Gottingen minipigs. In two animals, pre-ablation T2W CMR imaging was performed. Using fluoroscopy, a decapolar reference catheter was placed in the coronary sinus and a force-sensing ablation catheter (SmartTouch, D curve, Biosense Webster) was advanced into the right atrium. Using an electroanatomical mapping system (Carto3-MEM) the geometry of the right atrium was obtained with a 20-pole circular mapping catheter (Lasso Nav, D curve, Biosense Webster). A linear ablation lesion was created from the SVC to the IVC (30W, 48Â°C, 8 ml/min irrigation). Different target contact forces (>20 g (high force) or <10 g (low force)) were used alternately at the cranial and caudal halves of the ablation line. After the ablation procedure, the animals were immediately transferred for T2W CMR imaging of the ablation lesion. Maximal wall thickness in the posterior right atrium was measured for the caudal and cranial portions of the ablation lines. Results",2014,Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance
"On the sign recovery by LASSO, thresholded LASSO and thresholded Basis Pursuit Denoising","In the high-dimensional regression model Y = XÎ² + e, we provide new theoretical results on the probability of recovering the sign of Î² by the Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator (LASSO) and by the thresholded LASSO. It is well known that ""irrepresentability"" is a necessary condition for LASSO to recover the sign of Î² with a large probability. In this article we extend this result by providing a tight upper bound for the probability of LASSO sign recovery. This upper bound is smaller than 1/2 when the irrepresentable condition does not hold and thus generalizes Theorem 2 of Wainwright [27]. The bound depends on the tuning parameter Î» and is attained when non-null components of Î² tend to infinity; its value is equal to the limit of the probability that every null component of Î² is correctly estimated at 0. Consequently, this bound makes it possible to select Î» so as to control the probability of at least one false discovery. The ""irrepresentability"" is a stringent necessary condition to recover the sign of Î² by LASSO which can be substantially relaxed when LASSO estimates are additionally filtered out with an appropriately selected threshold. In this article we provide new theoretical results on thresholded LASSO and thresholded Basis Pursuit DeNoising (BPDN) in the asymptotic setup under which X is fixed and non-null components of Î² tend to infinity. Compared to the classical asymptotics, where X is a n Ã— p matrix and both n and p tend to +âˆž, our approach allows for reduction of the technical burden. Our main Theorem takes a simple form: When non-null components of Î² are sufficiently large, appropriately thresholded LASSO or thresholded BPDN can recover the sign of Î² if and only if Î² is identifiable with respect to the L1 norm, i.e. If XÎ³ = XÎ² and Î³ = Î² then Î³ 1 > Î² 1. To illustrate our results we present examples of irrepresentability and identifiability curves for some selected design matrices X. These curves provide the proportion of k sparse vectors Î² for which the irrep-* Corresponding author: tardivel@math.uni.wroc.pl 1 resentability and identifiability conditions hold. Our examples illustrate that ""irrepresentability"" is a much stronger condition than ""identifiability"", especially when the entries in each row of X are strongly correlated. Finally, we illustrate how the knockoff methodology [1, 8] can be used to select an appropriate threshold and that thresholded BPDN and LASSO can recover the sign of Î² with a larger probability than adaptive LASSO [32].",2019,arXiv: Methodology

CSP-TSM: Optimizing the performance of Riemannian tangent space mapping using common spatial pattern for MI-BCI,"BACKGROUND
Classification of electroencephalography (EEG) signals for motor imagery based brain computer interface (MI-BCI) is an exigent task and common spatial pattern (CSP) has been extensively explored for this purpose. In this work, we focused on developing a new framework for classification of EEG signals for MI-BCI.


METHOD
We propose a single band CSP framework for MI-BCI that utilizes the concept of tangent space mapping (TSM) in the manifold of covariance matrices. The proposed method is named CSP-TSM. Spatial filtering is performed on the bandpass filtered MI EEG signal. Riemannian tangent space is utilized for extracting features from the spatial filtered signal. The TSM features are then fused with the CSP variance based features and feature selection is performed using Lasso. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is then applied to the selected features and finally classification is done using support vector machine (SVM) classifier.


RESULTS
The proposed framework gives improved performance for MI EEG signal classification in comparison with several competing methods. Experiments conducted shows that the proposed framework reduces the overall classification error rate for MI-BCI by 3.16%, 5.10% and 1.70% (for BCI Competition III dataset IVa, BCI Competition IV Dataset I and BCI Competition IV Dataset IIb, respectively) compared to the conventional CSP method under the same experimental settings.


CONCLUSION
The proposed CSP-TSM method produces promising results when compared with several competing methods in this paper. In addition, the computational complexity is less compared to that of TSM method. Our proposed CSP-TSM framework can be potentially used for developing improved MI-BCI systems.",2017,Computers in biology and medicine
Contextual Analysis at Sagalassos,"Until recently, late antique quotidian objects were relegated to the domain of specialist studies and information relating to the context or assemblage within which the objects were found was rarely retained. The objects were studied as individual examples of form or type, rather than as part of an assemblage. The ability of archaeological evidence to contribute to the study of human behaviour largely derives from patterns in the dispersal of artefacts, however, and not simply from the objects themselves. A full description of the archaeological context of particular objects is thus required in order to maximise the recovery of data about the past. Contextual analysis, as it has been developed at Sagalassos, is used to identify human activities and their social and economic implications by carefully delineating the distribution of archaeological material, taking surrounding architecture and the process of context formation into account.",2009,Late Antique Archaeology
StudentLife: Using Smartphones to Assess Mental Health and Academic Performance of College Students,"Much of the stress and strain of student life remains hidden. The StudentLife continuous sensing app assesses the day-to-day and week-by-week impact of workload on stress, sleep, activity, mood, sociability, mental well-being and academic performance of a single class of 48 students across a 10 weeks term at Dartmouth College using Android phones. Results from the StudentLife study show a number of significant correlations between the automatic objective sensor data from smartphones and mental health and educational outcomes of the student body. We propose a simple model based on linear regression with lasso regularization that can accurately predict cumulative GPA. We also identify a Dartmouth term lifecycle in the data that shows students start the term with high positive affect and conversation levels, low stress, and healthy sleep and daily activity patterns. As the term progresses and the workload increases, stress appreciably rises while positive affect, sleep, conversation and activity drops off.

Prediction of volatility with penalized mixture distributions,"The research presented in this dissertation deals with robustness of two models describing daily realized volatility of stock market indexes, the HAR model introduced by Corsi (2009) and Lasso introduced by Tibshirani (1996). These models have been selected because of their ability to recover long memory dependence in the data. Comparison of forecast accuracy of these two models has been performed following research provided by Audrino and Knaus (2012). The results for stock market indexes obtained in this research coincide with the results reported by Corsi (2009) and Audrino and Knaus (2012). A new type of estimator, the MLE based on penalized mixture distribution was proposed and investigated for the two models explored in this thesis. This estimator can replicate nonnormal distribution of data and select appropriate mixture distribution function, which ts the analyzed data well. However, according to the empirical results described in this thesis, the new estimator doesn't improve forecast accuracy of both analyzed models for stock market indexes.",2015,

Distributed Multi-Speaker Voice Activity Detection for Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks,"A distributed multi-speaker voice activity detection (DM-VAD) method for wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) is proposed. DM-VAD is required in many signal processing applications, e.g. distributed speech enhancement based on multi-channel Wiener filtering, but is non-existent up to date. The proposed method neither requires a fusion center nor prior knowledge about the node positions, microphone array orientations or the number of observed sources. It consists of two steps: (i) distributed source-specific energy signal unmixing (ii) energy signal based voice activity detection. Existing computationally efficient methods to extract source-specific energy signals from the mixed observations, e.g., multiplicative non-negative independent component analysis (MNICA) quickly loose performance with an increasing number of sources, and require a fusion center. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a distributed energy signal unmixing method based on a source-specific node clustering method to locate the nodes around each source. To determine the number of sources that are observed in the WASN, a source enumeration method that uses a Lasso penalized Poisson generalized linear model is developed. Each identified cluster estimates the energy signal of a single (dominant) source by applying a two-component MNICA. The VAD problem is transformed into a clustering task, by extracting features from the energy signals and applying K-means type clustering algorithms. All steps of the proposed method are evaluated using numerical experiments. A VAD accuracy of $> 85 \%$ is achieved for a challenging scenario where 20 nodes observe 7 sources in a simulated reverberant rectangular room.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Charles Jesse Jones (1844-1919),"On 12 June 1879, 53-year-old Charles Jesse (""Buffalo)"" Jones left Garden City, Kansas, for the Far North to what nobody had done: capture a muskox and bring it back alive to ""civilization"". Jones was already internationally famous as ""The Savior of the American Bison"". ... At Fort Smith on the Slave River he was invited by Indians to a council. ""The muskox is sacred to us"", they warned. ""If you take muskox away, it will offend the Great Spirit. All our game will leave!"". ... He wanted muskoxen for study and use as well as display. He might even hybridize them with cattle. He advised the Indians to domesticate and propagate muskox as ordained by the Great Spirit in the White Man's Bible; then they would never starve. The Chippewas, Crees, and Slaves who comprised the council left planning how to thwart Jones. [The Indians cut the throats of the five muskoxen calves that Jones was able to capture.] Undismayed, he returned home via the Mackenzie River and Yukon gold camps, inspecting an island in the Bering Sea with a view to establishing a breeding farm for silver foxes. ... In 1902 President Theodore Roosevelt named him first game warden of the newly created Yellowstone Park. Poachers were decimating the park's wildlife. Roosevelt wanted someone who could stop them; Jones did. Soon he introduced Zane Grey to the West by taking him on a trip to lasso lions in Arizona. Grey, impressed, decided to make the West the subject of his writing and to pattern his heroes on Jones. ...

ADMM Algorithm for Graphical Lasso with an â„“âˆž Element-wise Norm Constraint,"We consider the problem of Graphical lasso with an additional lâˆž element-wise norm constraint on the precision matrix. This problem has applications in high-dimensional covariance decomposition such as in [Janzamin and Anandkumar, 2012a]. We propose an ADMM algorithm to solve this problem. We also use a continuation strategy on the penalty parameter to have a fast implemenation of the algorithm. 1 Problem The graphical lasso formulation with lâˆž element-wise norm constraint is as follows: min Î˜âˆˆR,Î˜â‰»0 âˆ’ log det(Î˜) + ã€ˆS,Î˜ã€‰+ Î³â€–Î˜âˆ’ diag(Î˜)â€–1 s.t. â€–Î˜âˆ’ diag(Î˜)â€–âˆž â‰¤ Î», (1) where â€– Â· â€–1 denotes the l1 norm, and â€– Â· â€–âˆž denotes the lâˆž element-wise norm of a matrix. For a matrix X , â€–Xâ€–âˆž = max i,j |Xij |. This formulation first appeared in [Janzamin and Anandkumar, 2012a] in the context of high-dimensional covariance decomposition. We next provide an efficient ADMM algorithm to solve (1). 2 ADMM approach The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm [Boyd et al., 2011, Eckstein, 2012] is especially suited to solve optimization problems whose objective can be decomposed into the sum of many simple convex functions. By simple, we mean a function whose proximal operator can be computed efficiently. The proximal operator of a function f is given by: Proxf (A, Î») = argmin X 1 2 â€–X âˆ’Aâ€–F + Î»f(X) (2) Consider the following optimization problem: min X,Y f(X) + g(Y ) s.t. X = Y , (3) where we assume that f and g are simple functions.

(Group 2). Both groups received spinal anaesthesia with 1.7 ml hyperbanc bupivacaine 0.75%. Visual analog pain scores at rest (RVAPS) and with movement (DVAPS) were recorded q 2 hr during the first 24 hr, then q 4 hr until discharge. Time to first walking, eating solid food, flatus, bowel movement. voiding and hospital discharge were recorded.ResultsPain scores were lower in Group 1 patients during the first 24 hr after spinal injection RVAPS 0.6 Â± 0.1 in Group 1vs 2.1 Â± 0.1 in Group 2 (mean Â± SEM), DVAPS 1.9 Â± 0.1 in Group 1 vs 4.1 Â± 0.1 in Group 2 (P < 0.0001). Times to first flatus, 36.1 hr Â± 2.9 vs 20.5 Â± 1.8 (P < 0.05) and to first bowel movement. 74.8 hr Â± 5.6vs 57.4 Â± 4 7 (P < 0.0001) were longer in Group 2 patients. There was no difference between groups in time to eating solid food, walking or hospital discharge.ConclusionMulti-modal pain therapy resulted in improved early post-operative analgesia dunng the first 24 hr after Caesarean delivery. Patients receivingiv PCA morphine followed by acetaminophen + codeine po were more likely to develop decreased bowel mobility. All patients, with one exception, achieved discharge cntena (eating solid food, absence of nausea, normal lochia. dry incision and DVAPS < 4) at 48 hr after spinal injection.RÃ©sumÃ©ObjectifComparer lâ€™efficacitÃ© dâ€™une association de mÃ©thodes analgÃ©siques avec celle de la morphine en PCA aprÃ¨s la cÃ©sarienne sous rachianesthÃ©sie.MÃ©thodesQuarante partunentes ASA 1â€“2 programmÃ©es pour une cÃ©sanenne non urgente ont Ã©tÃ© rÃ©parties alÃ©atoirement pour recevoir une analgÃ©sie combinant plusieurs mÃ©thodes (rachidienne Ã  la morphine, infiltration Ã  la bupivacaÃ¯ne du site de la laparotomie et ubiprofÃ¨ne + acÃ©taminophÃ¨nepo jusquâ€™au congÃ© (Groupe 1) ou un traitement conventionnel Ã  la morphineiv en PCA avec sevrage pour lâ€™acÃ©tammophÃ¨ne + codÃ©inepo (Groupe 2) Les deux groupes avaient reÃ§u une rachianesthÃ©sie avec 1,7 ml de buprvacaÃ¯ne 0,75% hyperbare. Les scores de douleur au repos sur une lâ€™Ã©chelle visuelle analogique (RVAPS) et avec mouvements (DVAPS) ont Ã©tÃ© enregistrÃ©s q2h pendant 24 h, ensurte q4h jusquâ€™au congÃ©. Lâ€™intervalle jusquâ€™Ã  lâ€™ambulation, lâ€™alimentation solide, la repnse des gaz et des matiÃ¨res, la miction et jusquâ€™au congÃ© hospitalier a Ã©tÃ© enregistrÃ©.RÃ©sultatsPendant la pÃ©node de 24 h suivant la rachianesthÃ©sie, les scores sur lâ€™Ã‰VA (moyenne Â±SEM) Ã©taient infÃ©neurs dans le groupe 1 Ã  ceux du groupe 2 (RVAPS 0,6 Â± 0,1 vs 2,1 Â± 0,1 et DVAPS 1.9 Â± 0.1 vs 4.1 Â± 0.1; P < 0.0001). La repnse des gaz (36.1 Â± 2.9h vs 20.5 Â± 1.8h; P < 0,05) et la premiÃ¨re selle (74.8 Â± 5.6h vs 57.4 Â± 4.7h; P < 0,0001) Ã©taient plus tardives dans le groupe 2. Le retour Ã  lâ€™alimentation solide, Ã  lâ€™ambulation et le moment du congÃ© ne diffÃ©rant pas.ConclusionLassociation de plusieurs mÃ©thodes thÃ©rapeutiques permet dâ€™amÃ©liorer lâ€™analgÃ©sie postopÃ©ratoire pendant les 24 h qui suivent la cÃ©sarienne. La PCA Ã  la morphine suivie dâ€™acÃ©taminophÃ¨ne + codÃ©inepo offre un plus grand risque de diminution de la motilitÃ© intestinale. Toutes les patientes, Ã  une exception prÃ¨s, ont atteint les cntÃ¨res du congÃ© (alimentation solide, absence de nausÃ©es, lochies normales, plate tane et DVAPS < 4) 48 h aprÃ¨s la rachianesthÃ©sie.",1997,Canadian Journal of Anaesthesia
"Motivating purchase of private label brands : Effects of Store image , price consciousness and perceived quality","1.1. Background and Context Private label Brands (PLBs) are explained as â€œstore brandsâ€, which are possessed by whole-sale or retailer (Hyman et al., 2010). According to Nielson (2014) played a significant role in Canada as well as numerous European markets. Earlier private label brands are considered as cheap, fewer quality unbranded alternatives in comparison to national brand but currently PLBs are seen as a trusted brands with equity(Cuneo, Lopez &Yague, 2012) and compete head-to-head with national brands(Huang & Huddleston, 2009). This has become apparent in current years that PLB are almost found in every category of product, as launched by retailers (Collins-Dodd & Lindley, 2003; Vahie & Paswan, 2006). According to PLMA(2015), PLBsâ€™ penetrated in Western European market and shown more than 50% of sales volume in Switzerland and Spain while shown 40% more penetration in main markets such as Austria, Portugal, Belgium , Germany and United Kingdom. Retailerâ€™s competitive strategy and differentiation can be significantly affected by PLBâ€™s from perspective of retailer (Lymperopoulos et al., 2010). Presently PLBâ€™s found in each and every category, specifically in grocery section (Lamey et al., 2007; Beneke, 2010). In reality, in the food industry, globally there is rise in the PLBâ€™s market share and penetration, while PLBs seen a good growth in food products (Lassoued and Hobbs, 2015). Retailers of numerous nations establish a optimistic brand image in terms of price they offer, promotions they generate and services they deliver sideways the brands they sell (Ailawadi and Keller, 2004). According to AC Neilson Report, 2005, 56% Indians accepted that PLBs as a better alternative in comparison to national brands. PLBs observed success in category of higher purchase, toughest in commoditydriven and where buyers perceive little differentiation. Neilson surveyed 30000 online buyers in 60 nations and shared some observations such as price plays a significant role in the purchase of PLBâ€™s and secondly consumers attracted to PLBs due to quality and value(62% buyers experienced like smart shopper while 67% feel that PLBs offers extremely better value for money. PLBsâ€™ has seen a great success in Western European market. It accounts for 33% of overall consumer packaged goods market. U K and Spain captured a 41% market of PLBs while Switzerland has captured highest share of PLB market as 45%. Need of the research: Clothes are most preferred category after FMCG/Grocery category. Retailers are gaining more profits and margins through PLBsâ€™. During earlier phase private label brands was smaller portion of retailer goods but now it takes a significant portion in merchandise. Shoppers are more eager to know about the goods of the store prior making any purchase; similar situation appears in Gujarat also. The current study focuses to get the idea about the purchase behavior of customers towards PLBsâ€™ taking into consideration some perceptual factors such as store image, price consciousness and perceived quality . Clothes are basically higher price merchandise than grocery. The present study is undertaken to understand the profile of customers visiting retail outlets like Pantaloons, West Side and Wills Lifestyle. To address this, the researcher has studied the some factors (perceptual) affecting consumers purchase intention of Gujarat State (Ahmedabad and Surat).",2018,
