"New Postcranial Elements of the Thalassodrominae (pterodactyloidea, Tapejaridae) from the Romualdo Formation (aptian-albian), Santana Group, Araripe Basin, Brazil","Tapejarids are edentate pterosaurs recovered mainly from Early Cretaceous deposits. They are diagnosed by five synapomorphies, among which only one is postcra- nial: a broad and well-developed tubercle at the ventroposte- rior margin of the coracoid. Regarding the clade Thalassodrominae, most phylogenetic studies are based on cranial elements, as postcranial skeletons of these pterosaurs are rare. Here, new postcranial material from the Romualdo Formation (Aptian-Albian) from the Araripe Basin is described. The material comprises the three posteriormost cervical vertebrae, the first seven dorsal vertebrae (fused into a notarium), both scapulocoracoids, a fragment of a ster- num, a partial right humerus, a small fragment of a 4th pha- lanx of the wing finger, a distal extremity of the right femur and the proximal portions of both tibia and fibula. Compari- sons with other specimens and morphological features exam- ined in a phylogenetic context, such as the presence of three foramina lateral and dorsal to the neural canal of the cervical vertebrae, the presence of a notarium and a pneu- matic foramen on the ventral side of the proximal portion of the humerus, allow the assignment of this specimen as Thalassodrominae indet. Regarding palaeobiogeographical aspects, to date, this clade is exclusively found in the Romu- aldo Formation. It is the most complete postcranial material assigned to the Thalassodrominae described so far.",2014,Palaeontology
Covariance and precision matrix estimation for high-dimensional time series,"We consider estimation of covariance matrices and their inverses (a.k.a. precision matrices) for high-dimensional stationary and locally stationary time series. In the latter case the covariance matrices evolve smoothly in time, thus forming a covariance matrix function. Using the functional dependence measure of Wu [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102 (2005) 14150-14154 (electronic)], we obtain the rate of convergence for the thresholded estimate and illustrate how the dependence affects the rate of convergence. Asymptotic properties are also obtained for the precision matrix estimate which is based on the graphical Lasso principle. Our theory substantially generalizes earlier ones by allowing dependence, by allowing nonstationarity and by relaxing the associated moment conditions.",2013,Annals of Statistics
Simultaneous Analysis of Lasso and Dantzig,"We exhibit an approximate equivalence between the Lasso es-timator and Dantzig selector. For both methods we derive parallel oracle inequalities for the prediction risk in the general nonparamet-ric regression model, as well as bounds on the p estimation loss for 1 â‰¤ p â‰¤ 2 in the linear model when the number of variables can be much larger than the sample size.",2007,
Down-regulation of Th2 cytokine expression by glucocorticoids in cultivated human lung mast cells*,"VOLUME 111, NUMBER 2 using dot blot analysis with the specific antibody, BB1. Ca 2+ fluxes were measured using Fluo-3. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) was measured by radio-receptor binding assay. RESULTS: Thrombin (250 U/ml) and trypsin (10 lag/ml) elevated intracetlular Ca 2Â§ ([Ca2+]i) in KU812 cells. Selective agonist peptides, to PAR-I (TFLLR, 100 gM) and PAR4 (AYPGKF, 300 ~tM) elevated [Ca2+]i but PAR2 selective peptides (SLIGRL, 50 gM and SLIGKV, 100 gM) caused no stimulation. PAR-I and PAR-4 selective peptides transiently increased IP 3 levels in KU812 cells, mRNA for PAR-I and PAR-4 was detected in KU812 cells and purified human basophils (n=3). Additionally mRNA for PAR-2 and -3 was faintly detected in one donor's basopbils. Agonist peptides failed to stimulate basogranulin release from basophils in four out of five experiments. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest the expression of PAR-1 and PAR4 by human basophils and KU812 cells. PAR-2 and PAR-3 may be expressed by basophils in some individuals. Selective stimulation of PAR1 or PAR-4 is generally insufficient to induce degranulation.

Schulman; Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA. RATIONALE: In allergen-induced asthma, mast cells play a critical role through the release of various mediators including Th2 cytokines. Glucocorticoids are used for treatment of allergic disorders; however their effects on human lung mast cell (HLMC) function have not been ftdly studied. Recently, we developed techniques to culture partially purified HLMC over months using stem cell factor and interleukin (IL)-4, in which HLMC become homogeneous, proliferate and maintain a functional phenotype equivalent to freshly isolated cells. METHODS: HLMC were cultured overnight with or without triamcinolone (10-6 M) to examine its effects on the regulation ofTh2 cytokines expression. HLMC were stimulated by antibody cross-linking of the highaffinity IgE receptor (FceRI). At 20 min post stimulation, percent histamine release (HR) was measured; at 2 hour, total cellular RNA was isolated, and reverse transcriptase/polymererase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to study cytokine gene expression. RESULTS: Spontaneous HR was 20-fold, with concurrent increases in IL-6 mRNA levels and DNA binding activity for key transcriptional regulators of the IL-6 promoter, NF-kB and AP-I. Comparisons of conditioned media and eosinophilfibroblasts co-culture using ""transwell"" barriers, indicated cell contact is unnecessary and the soluble nature of the mediators. Antibody neutralization of TGF-13 in the conditioned media produced only a 20% inhibition of fibroblast IL-6 secretion. Interestingly, neutralization of IL-113 and bFGF inhibited the IL-6 response by 60% and 15-20%, respectively. Antibody neutralization results were supported by the induction of fibroblast IL-6 secretion by recombinant IL-II3 (68-fold), TGF-I]I (2.5-tbld), and bFGF (l.5-fold). Neutralization of other potential eosinophil-derived mediators including GM-CSF, PDGF-BB, NGE and IL-4, had an insignificant effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a major role for eosinophilderived IL-113, TGF-13 and bFGF in fibroblast activation and eosinophilassociated fibrotic responses, including subepithelial fibrosis in asthma.

"A four-marker signature of TNF-RII, TGF-Î±, TIMP-1 and CRP is prognostic of worse survival in high-risk surgically resected melanoma","BackgroundE1694 tested GM2-KLH-QS21 vaccine versus high-dose interferon-Î±2b (HDI) as adjuvant therapy for operable stage IIB-III melanoma. We tested banked serum specimens from patients in the vaccine arm of E1694 for prognostic biomarkers.MethodsAushon Multiplex Platform was used to quantitate baseline serum levels of 115 analytes from 40 patients. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator proportional hazard regression (Lasso PH) was used to select markers that are most informative for relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Regular Cox PH models were then fit with the markers selected by the Lasso PH. Survival receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the ability of the models to predict 1-year RFS and 5-year OS.ResultsFour markers that include Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha Receptor II (TNF-RII), Transforming Growth Factor alpha (TGF-Î±), Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were found to be most informative for the prediction of OS (high levels correlate with worse prognosis). The dichotomized risk score based on the four markers could significantly separate the OS curves (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0005). When using the four-marker PH model to predict 5-year OS, we achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 89% (cross validated AUCâ€‰=â€‰72%). High baseline TNF-RII was also significantly associated with worse RFS. The RFS with high (above median) TNF-RII was significantly lower than low TNF-RII (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01).ConclusionsThe biomarker signature consisting of TNFR-II, TGF-Î±, TIMP-1 and CRP is significantly prognostic of survival in patients with high-risk melanoma and warrants further investigation.",2013,Journal of Translational Medicine
Functional Variable Selection for EMG-based Control of a Robotic Hand Prosthetic,"State-of-the-art robotic hand prosthetics generate finger and wrist movement through pattern recognition (PR) algorithms using features of forearm electromyogram (EMG) signals, but re- quires extensive training and is prone to poor predictions for conditions outside the training data (Peerdeman et al., 2011; Scheme et al., 2010). We propose a novel approach to develop a dynamic robotic limb by utilizing the recent history of EMG signals in a model that accounts for physiological features of hand movement which are ignored by PR algorithms. We do this by viewing EMG signals as functional covariates and develop a functional linear model that quantifies the effect of the EMG signals on finger/wrist velocity through a bivariate coefficient function that is allowed to vary with current finger/wrist position. The model is made par- simonious and interpretable through a two-step variable selection procedure, called Sequential Adaptive Functional Empirical group LASSO (SAFE-gLASSO). Numerical studies show excel- lent selection and prediction properties of SAFE-gLASSO compared to popular alternatives. For our motivating dataset, the method correctly identifies the few EMG signals that are known to be important for an able-bodied subject with negligible false positives and the model can be directly implemented in a robotic prosthetic.",2018,arXiv: Applications
Sparsistency of the Edge Lasso over Graphs,"The fused lasso was proposed recently to enable recovery of high-dimensional patterns which are piece-wise constant on a graph, by penalizing the â€˜1-norm of dierences of measurements at vertices that share an edge. While there have been some attempts at coming up with ecient algorithms for solving the fused lasso optimization, a theoretical analysis of its performance is mostly lacking except for the simple linear graph topology. In this paper, we investigate sparsistency of fused lasso for general graph structures, i.e. its ability to correctly recover the exact support of piece-wise constant graphstructured patterns asymptotically (for largescale graphs). To emphasize this distinction over previous work, we will refer to it as Edge Lasso. We focus on the (structured) normal means setting, and our results provide necessary and sucient conditions on the graph properties as well as the signal-to-noise ratio needed to ensure sparsistency. We examplify our results using simple graph-structured patterns, and demonstrate that in some cases fused lasso is sparsistent at very weak signal-to-noise ratios (scaling as p (logn)=jAj, where n is the number of vertices in the graph and A is the smallest set of vertices with constant activation). In other cases, it performs no better than thresholding the dierence",2012,
K-part Lasso based on feature selection algorithm for high-dimensional data,"Lasso is a feature selection method based on 1-norm.Compared with the existing feature selection methods,it not only selects the features with strong correlation with the class label,but also has good stability,so that it has received considerable attention.However,with a high-dimensional and large dataset,like other feature selection methods,Lasso encounters the problems of large computation and overfitting.To address this issue,this paper proposes an improved Lasso method,called K-part Lasso.The K-part Lasso method divides the feature set into K-parts.It selects the features from each feature subset,and then merges the selected features into one feature set.It selects the features from this merged feature set.Experimental results show that the K-part Lasso method can effectively deal with the high-dimensional and large sample datasets.",2012,Computer Engineering and Applications
Is radiofrequency energy a necessary and safe complement to cryotherapy for successful pulmonary vein isolation,"Abstract Introduction Pulmonary vein (PV) isolation is considered the cornerstone of atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation. PV isolation (PVI) by means of cryotherapy has emerged as a promising technique due to both a low thrombogenicity and reduced risk of PV stenosis. The evaluation (need/efficiency/safety) of hybrid therapy (defined as the use of cryotherapy followed by that of radiofrequency energy in a given patient) is the aim of the present study. Methods Thirty-four consecutive patients (26 men, mean age: 56.7Â Â±Â 9.3Â years) with symptomatic drug-refractory paroxysmal AF underwent PVI using a balloon-cryotherapy (BCT). A maximum of four cryotherapy applications was applied per PV and disconnection assessed thereafter using a circular LASSOÂ® catheter. When necessary, PV disconnection was then performed using a 4Â mm irrigated-tip catheter. All patients underwent CT-scan evaluation before discharge to detect acute PV stenosis. Results PVI could be achieved in all patients. Mean procedure duration was 230Â Â±Â 42Â min and mean fluoroscopy time was 52Â Â±Â 13Â min. Hybrid therapy was needed to achieve PVI in 26 of 34 (76%). With cryoablation solely, PVI was achieved in 90 of 136 (66%) targeted veins, efficacy being higher in superior as compared to inferior PVs (87% vs. 46%, pÂ  Conclusions Our study suggests that hybrid ablation therapy is necessary in most patients to achieve PV disconnection after a maximum of four blinded applications of balloon-cryotherapy (especially in inferior PVs), with a significant short-term success rate.",2011,The Egyptian Heart Journal
Comparison of a gradient-based and LASSO (ISTA) algorithm for sparse signal reconstruction,"Sparse signal reconstruction performed by two different algorithms is considered. First algorithm is the ISTA algorithm for LASSO minimization, while the second one is the gradient-based descent algorithm. Algorithms perform signal reconstruction in a completely different way. The ISTA algorithm reconstructs signals in the sparsity transformation domain. The gradient descent algorithm performs reconstruction in time/measurements domain, considering the missing samples as variables. Both of them use the l1-norm in minimization. Computational time and mean absolute error are used in comparison analysis presented in this paper.",2016,2016 5th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)
Metabolic reprogramming-associated genes predict overall survival for rectal cancer.,"Metabolic reprogramming has become a hot topic recently in the regulation of tumour biology. Although hundreds of altered metabolic genes have been reported to be associated with tumour development and progression, the important prognostic role of these metabolic genes remains unknown. We downloaded messenger RNA expression profiles and clinicopathological data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Gene Expression Omnibus database to uncover the prognostic role of these metabolic genes. Univariate Cox regression analysis and lasso Cox regression model were utilized in this study to screen prognostic associated metabolic genes. Patients with high-risk demonstrated significantly poorer survival outcomes than patients with low-risk in the TCGA database. Also, patients with high-risk still showed significantly poorer survival outcomes than patients with low-risk in the GEO database. What is more, gene set enrichment analyses were performed in this study to uncover significantly enriched GO terms and pathways in order to help identify potential underlying mechanisms. Our study identified some survival-related metabolic genes for rectal cancer prognosis prediction. These genes might play essential roles in the regulation of metabolic microenvironment and in providing significant potential biomarkers in metabolic treatment.",2020,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine
Pattern Recognition in Non-Stationary Environmental Time Series Using Sparse Regression,"Abstract The various real-world tasks of environmental management make it necessary to obtain the hindcasts and forecasts of natural events (wind, ocean waves and currents, sea ice, etc.) using data-driven techniques for metocean processes simulation. The models can be fitted to specific fragments of the non-stationary multivariate time series individually to reproduce metocean environment with desired characteristics. In the paper, the approach based on the LASSO regularised regression is proposed for the environmental time series clustering. It allows the identify the situations with specific interaction between variables, that can be interpreted by the values regression coefficients. The weather generator was used to produce both synthetic time series similar to the general dataset and the identified clusters. The obtained results can be used to increase the quality of the computationally lightweight environmental modelsâ€™ identification and interpretation.",2019,Procedia Computer Science
Isolation and characterization of carbazole-degrading bacteria from mangrove environment,"Carbazole is an aromatic heterocyclic organic compound usually found in river sediment that can possess to 
toxic activities that will lend serious environmental problems. This study was conducted to isolate and 
characterize carbazole-degrading bacteria from mangrove environment. The samples were collected from Bako 
National Park and the presence of carbazole-degrading bacteria was confirmed through enrichment culture of the 
samples. Screening of the bacteria was successfully done by observing the growth of the strains on ONR7a agar 
containing carbazole as sole carbon source. Four different strains of carbazole degrading bacteria that are able to 
grow on carbazole source were isolated. Isolate strains were characterized using phenotypic and molecular 
techniques. From the BLAST search, four different strains of carbazole degrading bacteria were identified as 
Sphingomonas sp., Flavobacterium sp., Gaetbulibacter sp., and Thalassospira sp. with maximum identity of 
100%, 97%, 99%, and 99% respectively. All strains appeared as a non-motile Gram-negative rod shaped 
bacterium",2012,
"Acquisition of a defended resource: a benefit of group foraging for the neotropical wrasse, Thalassoma lucasanum","SynopsisThe neotropical Pacific wrasse, Thalassoma lucasanum, forms groups of 30 to 300 individuals that overwhelm the defense of embryos by the Pacific sergeant major, Abudefduf troschelii, and thereby gain access to a food resource from which solitary individuals are effectively excluded by paternal defense. The duration of feeding by the wrasse groups and the fraction of embryos eaten in a nest are positively correlated with group size. The benefit of group foraging is probably derived from a reduction in the frequency with which group members experience attack by defending sergeant majors, as reflected in the positive correlation of group size with feeding duration. Large foraging groups only form when sergeant major embryos are present in nests, indicating that this is a primary benefit of participation in these groups for this wrasse. In contrast, in the Caribbean large foraging groups of the congeneric bluehead wrasse, T. bifasciatum, fail to form despite the presence of defended embryos of the Caribbean sergeant major, A. saxatilis. This might be due to the relatively low population densities of the Caribbean wrasse in comparison to those of the Pacific wrasse or to the relatively low densities of Caribbean sergeant major nests containing embryos at any time.",2004,Environmental Biology of Fishes
IdentificaciÃ³n y caracterizaciÃ³n de una glicina oxidasa en Marinomonas mediterranea perteneciente a una nueva familia de qinoproteÃ­nas,"Resumen Tesis doctoral de Jonatan C. Campillo Brocal para TESEO
Las L-aminoacido oxidasas (LAOs) son flavoproteinas que oxidan L-aminoacidos en posicion alfa y producen el cetoacido correspondiente, amonio y peroxido de hidrogeno, que les proporciona cierta capacidad antimicrobiana. Estan ampliamente distribuidas a lo largo de la escala evolutiva y estan implicadas en procesos como la defensa innata de peces, sistema inmune de humanos, desarrollo de biofilms bacterianos, etc. El estudio de las LAOs tiene un gran interes en campos como la biomedicina y son importantes a nivel biotecnologico, ya que pueden ser aplicadas en el desarrollo de biosensores, en la produccion de antibioticos, en biotransformaciones, etc. 
La enzima LodA sintetizada por Marinomonas mediterranea ha sido la primera aminoacido oxidasa descrita que no es una flavoproteina, sino que presenta cofactor quinonico de tipo cisteina triptofilquinona (CTQ) generado por modificacion post-traduccional de ciertos residuos en la misma proteina. LodA es una novedosa L-lisina ?-oxidasa (EC 1.4.3.20) que presenta una gran estabilidad y alta especificidad frente a L-lisina. Esta codificada por el gen lodA que forma parte del operon lod junto a lodB, gen que codifica una flavoproteina que interviene en la generacion del cofactor de LodA. El mutante LD de M. mediterranea, con una delecion del operon lod, pierde totalmente la actividad lisina oxidasa. Analisis bioinformaticos han puesto de manifiesto la presencia de varios genes similares a lodA en diversos genomas microbianos, asi como dos de ellos en el genoma de M. mediterranea, anotados como que codifican proteinas hipoteticas de funcion desconocida. Estas observaciones suponen el punto de partida de este trabajo que tiene como objetivo principal estudiar si los genes similares a lodA codifican nuevas oxidasas no caracterizadas hasta la fecha. 
En este estudio se ha identificado y caracterizado una nueva proteina en M. mediterranea con actividad glicina oxidasa (GOX) denominada GoxA, que presenta notables diferencias con las glicina oxidasas descritas en la bibliografia. Por un lado es mas especifica para la glicina, y por otro, no une FAD sino que presenta cofactor quinonico de tipo CTQ. Esta codificada por el gen goxA, uno de los dos genes similares a lodA detectados en el genoma de M. mediterranea. goxA forma un operon junto con goxB, gen que codifica una flavoproteina similar a LodB. Hemos identificado el inicio de la transcripcion, asi como la region promotora de dicho operon y se ha comparado con el del resto de oxidasas de Marinomonas. 
El operon gox ha sido expresado de forma recombinante en varias cepas de E. coli. La fusion de GoxA a una etiqueta de poli-his ha permitido la purificacion de la proteina recombinante y su posterior caracterizacion. El estudio de la regulacion del operon gox pone de manifiesto la presencia de elementos comunes que intervienen en la expresion de las actividades oxidasa de M. mediterranea, como por ejemplo el sistema de dos componentes PpoS/PpoR.
Por otro lado, hemos demostrado que tgox2, gen similar a goxA presente en el genoma de Thalassobaculum salexigens, codifica una glicina oxidasa con identicas propiedades a GoxA. Esta observacion apoya nuestra hipotesis inicial. 
Nuestro estudio revela que las proteinas similares a LodA constituyen una nueva familia de quinoproteinas con actividad oxidasa que estan ampliamente distribuidas en microorganismos. Todas ellas muestran conservados los residuos de cisteina y triptofano que forman parte del cofactor CTQ en LodA y GoxA. En definitiva, este trabajo supone una plataforma para estudiar el mecanismo de modificacion post-transcripcional implicado en la formacion del cofactor CTQ, asi como para explorar las posibles nuevas actividades de las proteinas similares a LodA/GoxA cuyo estudio puede derivar en novedosas aplicaciones biotecnologicas.
 Summary of Jonatan C. Campillo Brocal doctoral thesis for TESEO 
L-amino acid oxidases (LAOs) are flavoproteins oxidizing L-amino acids in alpha position to generate the corresponding keto acid, ammonium and hydrogen peroxide, which confers to them antimicrobial activity. They are widespread in organisms, from bacteria to mammals. They are involved in distinct processes, such as bacterial biofilm development, protection of fish skin bacterial infections and participation in the human immune system. Studying LAOs is of a broad interest in biomedicine and in relation to their biotechnological applications since they can be applied in biosensor development, antibiotics production and biotransformation. 
LodA enzyme synthetized by Marinomonas mediterranea has been the first amino acid oxidase described that is not a flavoprotein but presents a cysteine tryptophylquinone (CTQ) cofactor, which is generated by post-translational modification of residues in the same protein. LodA is a novel L-lysine epsilon-oxidase (EC 1.4.3.20) very stable and specific for L-lysine. It is encoded by lodA gene, which forms the lod operon together with lodB, gene encoding a flavoprotein related with the LodA cofactor generation. M. mediterranea strain with lod deletion, LD mutant, lacks completely lysine oxidase activity. Bioinformatics reveal diverse genes similar to lodA in different bacterial genomes, as well as two of them in M. mediterranea, which are annotated to encode hypothetical proteins with unknown function. Those observations represent the beginning of this work, which pretends to study whether operons similar to lod could encode a novel family of enzymes with amino acid oxidase activity. 
A new protein with glycine oxidase activity has been identified characterized in M. mediterranea. It is named GoxA and differs from conventional glycine oxidases in terms of substrate specificity and type of cofactor. Especially, it is much more specific for glycine and not bind FAD but contains a CTQ cofactor. GoxA is encoded by the goxA gene that forms part of an operon with a second gene, goxB, which codes for a flavoprotein necessary to generate active GoxA. We identified the initial transcription site of gox operon, as well as its promoter that exhibits potential regulatory elements. 
gox operon has been successfully expressed in various E. coli strains. Conditions for induction were optimized and GoxA fused to a poly-His tag in N-terminus was expressed. This tag, which did not affect to GOX activity, has permitted the isolation and characterization of the recombinant enzyme. Our results show that both native and recombinant proteins share similar properties. The study of gox regulation has indicated the presence of some common elements, such as the two-component regulatory system PpoS/PpoR, which are involved in the expression of every M. mediterranea oxidase. 
GOX activity has been also detected in the alphaproteobacteria Nisaea denitrificans and Thalassobaculum salexigens. In the latter, the activity was associated to TGox2, a GoxA similar protein. Both GoxA and TGox2 seem to be comparable proteins since they display similar characteristics, such as substrate specificity and CTQ cofactor presence. 
Our results have revealed the existence of a novel family of quinoproteins similar to LodA, with oxidase activity, which are widespread in many different groups of bacteria. Sequence alignment of LodA-like proteins allowed the detection of several conserved domains and residues, such as the cysteine and tryptophan that are forming part of the CTQ cofactor in LodA and GoxA. Furthermore, LodA-like proteins are encoded by an operon that contains a second gene similar to lodB, which could be related with the correct expression of the LodA-like protein located in the same operon. In conclusion, this study provides a platform to explore the potentially novel enzymatic activities of the proteins detected, the mechanisms of post-translational modifications involved in their synthesis, as well as their biological relevance.",2016,
Gene Regulatory Networks from Multifactorial Perturbations Using Graphical Lasso: Application to the DREAM4 Challenge,"A major challenge in the field of systems biology consists of predicting gene regulatory networks based on different training data. Within the DREAM4 initiative, we took part in the multifactorial sub-challenge that aimed to predict gene regulatory networks of size 100 from training data consisting of steady-state levels obtained after applying multifactorial perturbations to the original in silico network. Due to the static character of the challenge data, we tackled the problem via a sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field, which relates network topology with the covariance inverse generated by the gene measurements. As for the computations, we used the Graphical Lasso algorithm which provided a large range of candidate network topologies. The main task was to select the optimal network topology and for that, different model selection criteria were explored. The selected networks were compared with the golden standards and the results ranked using the scoring metrics applied in the challenge, giving a better insight in our submission and the way to improve it.Our approach provides an easy statistical and computational framework to infer gene regulatory networks that is suitable for large networks, even if the number of the observations (perturbations) is greater than the number of variables (genes).",2010,PLoS ONE

The Only Exit From Modern Philosophy,"Abstract This article contends that the central principle of modern philosophy is obscured by a side-debate between two opposed camps that are united in accepting a deeper flawed premise. Consider the powerful critiques of Kantian philosophy offered by Quentin Meillassoux and Bruno Latour, respectively. These two thinkers criticize Kant for opposite reasons: Meillassoux because Kant collapses thought and world into a permanent â€œcorrelateâ€ without isolated terms, and Latour because Kant tries to purify thought and world from each other rather than realizing that they are always combined in â€œhybridâ€ form. What both critiques tacitly accept is the notion that â€œthoughtâ€ and â€œworldâ€ are the two major poles of the universe. I claim that this stems from the post-Cartesian assumption that thought and world are the two basic kinds of things that exist. The name â€œonto-taxonomyâ€ is introduced for this view.",2020,Open Philosophy
Macroeconomic variable selection for creditor recovery rates,"We study the relationship between U.S. corporate bond recovery rates and macroeconomic variables used in the credit risk literature. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is used in selecting macroeconomic variables. The LASSO-selected macroeconomic variables are considered to be explanatory variables in ordinary least squares regressions, bootstrap aggregating (bagging), regression trees, boosting, LASSO, ridge regression and support vector regression techniques. We compare the out-of-sample predictive power of two types of models (LASSO-selected models with models that add principal components derived from 179 macroeconomic variables as explanatory variables). We find the recovery models with LASSO-selected macroeconomic variables outperform suggested models in the literature.",2018,Journal of Banking and Finance
Triterpene glycosides defend the Caribbean reef sponge Erylus formosus from predatory fishes,"The reef sponge Erylus formosus (Demospongiae: Geodiidae) from the Bahamas and southern Florida contains a suite of triterpene glycosides that, at a natural volumetric concentration, deters predation by the fish Thalassoma bifasciatum in laboratory assays, and a natural assemblage of reef fishes in field assays. Antifeedant metabolites were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation of extracts of E. formosus using standard chromatographic methods and identified by nuclear mag- netic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Included in the deterrent mixture from E. formosus collected in the Bahamas and Florida were at least 6 related triterpene glycosides pos- sessing identical aglycones but with different sugar residues. Two additional compounds with a penasterol triterpene core (formoside, and an N-acetyl galactosamine derivative, formoside B) were found in specimens from the Bahamas but not Florida. Formoside, while being the major deterrent metabolite of E. formosus from the Bahamas, is less potent than the other triterpene glycosides on a weight per volume basis. As a mixture, the triterpene glycosides protect E. formosus from predatory reef fishes, but when these compounds were separated into fractions some failed to deter feeding at natural concentrations. As compounds of this type are beginning to be recognized as prevalent sponge metabolites, we suggest that terpene glycosides may have important ecological functions, just as a defensive role has been ascribed to similar compounds in sea stars, sea cucumbers, and ter- restrial plants.",2000,Marine Ecology Progress Series
Cancer Subtype Discovery and Biomarker Identification via a New Robust Network Clustering Algorithm,"In cancer biology, it is very important to understand the phenotypic changes of the patients and discover new cancer subtypes. Recently, microarray-based technologies have shed light on this problem based on gene expression profiles which may contain outliers due to either chemical or electrical reasons. These undiscovered subtypes may be heterogeneous with respect to underlying networks or pathways, and are related with only a few of interdependent biomarkers. This motivates a need for the robust gene expression-based methods capable of discovering such subtypes, elucidating the corresponding network structures and identifying cancer related biomarkers. This study proposes a penalized model-based Student's t clustering with unconstrained covariance (PMT-UC) to discover cancer subtypes with cluster-specific networks, taking gene dependencies into account and having robustness against outliers. Meanwhile, biomarker identification and network reconstruction are achieved by imposing an adaptive [Formula: see text] penalty on the means and the inverse scale matrices. The model is fitted via the expectation maximization algorithm utilizing the graphical lasso. Here, a network-based gene selection criterion that identifies biomarkers not as individual genes but as subnetworks is applied. This allows us to implicate low discriminative biomarkers which play a central role in the subnetwork by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes, or have cluster-specific underlying network structures. Experiment results on simulated datasets and one available cancer dataset attest to the effectiveness, robustness of PMT-UC in cancer subtype discovering. Moveover, PMT-UC has the ability to select cancer related biomarkers which have been verified in biochemical or biomedical research and learn the biological significant correlation among genes.",2013,PLoS ONE
Effect of m6A RNA Methylation Regulators on Malignant Progression and Prognosis in Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma,"Objectives: This study aims to explore the roles of 13 m6A RNA methylation regulators in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and identify a risk signature and prognostic values of m6A RNA methylation regulators in ccRCC. Materials and Methods: RNA sequence data of ccRCC was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Differentially expressed of 13 m6A RNA methylation regulators in ccRCC stratified by different clinicopathological characteristics were unveiled using â€œlimmaâ€ package in R version 3.6.0. Cox regression and LASSO analyses were conducted to identify the powerful independent prognostic factors in ccRCC associated with overall survival (OS). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and correlation analyses of the 13 m6A RNA methylation regulators were performed using â€œSTRINGâ€ and R package, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also done using R. In addition, gene ontology (GO), GSEA and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were used to functionally annotate the differentially expressed genes in different subgroups. Results: Most of the 13 m6A RNA methylation regulators are differentially expressed in ccRCC tissue samples stratified by different clinicopathological characteristics in 537 patients. Next, a risk signature for predicting prognosis of ccRCC patients, was established based on two powerful independent prognostic m6A RNA methylation regulators (METTL14 and METTL3). Then, two subgroups (cluster1 and 2) were identified by consensus clustering to the two powerful independent factors and the cluster1 had a poorer prognosis than cluster2. Furthermore, the genes in cluster1 were significantly enriched in cancer-related pathways, biological process, and hallmarks, including â€œcell adhesion molecules (CAMs),â€ â€œleukocyte migration,â€ â€œWnt/Î²-catenin signaling,â€ and so on. Conclusion: M6A RNA methylation regulators play important roles in the initiation and progression of ccRCC and provide a novel sight to understand m6A RNA modification in ccRCC.",2020,Frontiers in Oncology

La plaque Lasso. Un implant original pour le traitement des fractures Regan-Morrey I et II de la coronoÃ¯de ulnaire,"Abstract Introduction Coronoid fractures are notoriously difficult to manage particularly when there is a small fragment. We report a retrospective analysis of our experience with consecutive type I and II Regan-Morrey coronoid fractures using a lasso plate. Hypothesis Type I and II Regan-Morrey coronoid fractures can be effectively managed using a lasso plate. Methods From October, 2011Â and December, 2013, 25Â patients (21Â males and 4Â females, mean age 40.0Â years) with type I and II Regan-Morrey coronoid fractures were treated with the open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using the lasso plate. Postoperative measurements of the elbow range of motion were recorded. Elbow function was evaluated by the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score. Results All patients were re-examined at a mean follow-up of 32.7Â months (range, 24â€“49Â months). The mean fractures healing time was 13.6Â weeks (range, 6â€“18Â weeks). The mean flexion range of the elbow was 121.8Â° (range, 90Â°â€“135Â°), and the mean extention range of the elbow was 10.6Â° (range, 0Â°â€“20Â°). The mean pronation range of the forearm was 75.8Â° (range, 65Â°â€“85Â°). The mean supination range of the forearm was 80.4Â° (range 70Â°â€“90Â°). The mean DASH score was 10.2 (range 0â€“28). The mean MEPS was 83.4 (range 55â€“95), 8Â patients (32Â %) were rated excellent, 14Â patients (56Â %) were rated good, 2 (8Â %) patients were rated fair. 1 (4Â %) patient were rated poor. No patient was seriously infected, implant breakage was found in one case. Two cases of elbow heterotopic ossification (HO) were observed. Two cases of elbow medial instability were observed. Discussion The type I and II Regan-Morrey coronoid fractures combined with the instability of the elbow should be operated. The lasso plate reduces the pressure between the wire and the insertion of capsule. A tight wire results in greater stability than ordinary suture fixation, thus enabling early functional exercise. Conclusion In the treatment of type I and II Regan-Morrey coronoid fractures, lasso plate can provide concentric fracture reduction of the elbow and stable fixation to allow for early rehabilitation. Good clinical outcomes can be anticipated. Level of evidence Level IV: retrospective study.",2017,Revue de Chirurgie OrthopÃ©dique et Traumatologique
Prediction of gene expression with cis-SNPs using mixed models and regularization methods,"BackgroundIt has been shown that gene expression in human tissues is heritable, thus predicting gene expression using only SNPs becomes possible. The prediction of gene expression can offer important implications on the genetic architecture of individual functional associated SNPs and further interpretations of the molecular basis underlying human diseases.MethodsWe compared three types of methods for predicting gene expression using only cis-SNPs, including the polygenic model, i.e. linear mixed model (LMM), two sparse models, i.e. Lasso and elastic net (ENET), and the hybrid of LMM and sparse model, i.e. Bayesian sparse linear mixed model (BSLMM). The three kinds of prediction methods have very different assumptions of underlying genetic architectures. These methods were evaluated using simulations under various scenarios, and were applied to the Geuvadis gene expression data.ResultsThe simulations showed that these four prediction methods (i.e. Lasso, ENET, LMM and BSLMM) behaved best when their respective modeling assumptions were satisfied, but BSLMM had a robust performance across a range of scenarios. According to R2 of these models in the Geuvadis data, the four methods performed quite similarly. We did not observe any clustering or enrichment of predictive genes (defined as genes with R2â€‰â‰¥â€‰0.05) across the chromosomes, and also did not see there was any clear relationship between the proportion of the predictive genes and the proportion of genes in each chromosome. However, an interesting finding in the Geuvadis data was that highly predictive genes (e.g. R2â€‰â‰¥â€‰0.30) may have sparse genetic architectures since Lasso, ENET and BSLMM outperformed LMM for these genes; and this observation was validated in another gene expression data. We further showed that the predictive genes were enriched in approximately independent LD blocks.ConclusionsGene expression can be predicted with only cis-SNPs using well-developed prediction models and these predictive genes were enriched in some approximately independent LD blocks. The prediction of gene expression can shed some light on the functional interpretation for identified SNPs in GWASs.",2017,BMC Genomics
"GiSK: making secure, reliable and scalable VO repository virtualizing generic disks in the grid","The grid has been recognized in industry as an important means of addressing issues of virtualization and distributed system management. Storage virtualization is the logical abstraction of physical storage and has tremendous potential for simplifying storage administration and reducing costs for managing diverse storage assets. In this paper, we study ways to virtualize heterogeneous storage systems in grid and introduce a new secure, reliable, and scalable VO repository system, referred as GiSK, using storage virtualization for generic disks in the grid. Through the lessons from GiSK, we identify a few important issues required to realize a storage virtualization system in the grid and suggest the ""lassoing a stake in order"" strategy for data reliability and the fine-grained access control mechanism using the GSI certificate",2005,Eighth International Conference on High-Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region (HPCASIA'05)
Problem set up and motivation,"Today, we analyze an application of random projection to compute approximate solutions of constrained least-squares problems. This method is often referred to as sketched least-squares. Suppose that we are given an observation vector y âˆˆ R n and matrix A âˆˆ R nÃ—d , and that for some convex set C âŠ‚ R d , we would like to compute the constrained least-squares solution x LS : = argmin xâˆˆC 1 2 y âˆ’ Ax 2 2 : =f (x). In general, this solution may not be unique, but we assume throughout this lecture that uniqueness holds (so that n â‰¥ d necessarily). Different versions of the constrained least-squares problem arise in many applications: â€¢ In the simplest case of an unconstrained problem (C = R d), it corresponds to the usual least-squares estimator, which has been widely studied. Most past work on sketching least-squares has focused on this case. â€¢ When C is a scaled form of the 1-ballâ€”that is, C = {x âˆˆ R d | x 1 â‰¤ R}â€”then the constrained problem is known as the Lasso. It is widely used for estimating sparse regression vectors. â€¢ The support vector machine for classification, when solved in its dual form, leads to a least-squares problem over a polytope C. Problems of the form (3.1) can also arise as intermediate steps of using Newton's method to solve a constrained optimization problem. The original problem can be difficult to solve if the first matrix dimension n is too large. Thus, in order to reduce both storage and computation requirements, a natural idea is to randomly project the original data to a lower-dimensional space. In particular, given a random sketch matrix S âˆˆ R mÃ—n , consider the sketched least-squares problem x : = argmin xâˆˆC 1 2 S(y âˆ’ Ax) 2 2 : =g(x) .",2015,
A Distributed ADMM Approach for Collaborative Regression Learning in Edge Computing,"With the recent proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT), enormous amount of data are produced by wireless sensors and connected devices at the edge of network. Conventional cloud computing raises serious concerns on communication latency, bandwidth cost, and data privacy. To address these issues, edge computing has been introduced as a new paradigm that allows computation and analysis to be performed in close proximity with data sources. In this paper, we study how to conduct regression analysis when the training samples are kept private at source devices. Specifically, we consider the lasso regression model that has been widely adopted for prediction and forecasting based on information gathered from sensors. By adopting the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we decompose the original regression problem into a set of subproblems, each of which can be solved by an IoT device using its local data information. During the iterative solving process, the participating device only needs to provide some intermediate results to the edge server for lasso training. Extensive experiments based on two datasets are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed scheme.",2019,Cmc-computers Materials & Continua
Enhancing the Lasso Approach for Developing a Survival Prediction Model Based on Gene Expression Data,"In the past decade, researchers in oncology have sought to develop survival prediction models using gene expression data. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) has been widely used to select genes that truly correlated with a patient's survival. The lasso selects genes for prediction by shrinking a large number of coefficients of the candidate genes towards zero based on a tuning parameter that is often determined by a cross-validation (CV). However, this method can pass over (or fail to identify) true positive genes (i.e., it identifies false negatives) in certain instances, because the lasso tends to favor the development of a simple prediction model. Here, we attempt to monitor the identification of false negatives by developing a method for estimating the number of true positive (TP) genes for a series of values of a tuning parameter that assumes a mixture distribution for the lasso estimates. Using our developed method, we performed a simulation study to examine its precision in estimating the number of TP genes. Additionally, we applied our method to a real gene expression dataset and found that it was able to identify genes correlated with survival that a CV method was unable to detect.",2015,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine
"Palynological and paleoenvironmental analyses of selected shale samples from Orange basin, South Africa","Core and ditch cutting of shaly samples were selected from 5 wells within the Orange Basin, South Africa. It was with a view to studying the palynological contents of the samples and to also delineate theÂ  environment and condition in which the samples were formed. The samples were prepared for palynological studies using standard extraction techniques involving HCL, HF treatments, wet sieving with 10 Î¼m polyester sieve and mounting of samples on glass slides using glycerine jelly. The samples were moderately abundant and diversified in pollen and spores. Sixty-eight palynomorphs species were identified and were used for biozonation. Two biozones were identified in this study. These were SI in Wells A_C2, A_U1 and top of Well O_A1 and SII in Wells K_BI, A_F1 and base of Well O_A1. The SI with interval between 2030 m and 4170 m was characterized by acme of Inaperturopollenites sp at 2697 m in Well O_A1. Other palynomorphs identified within the zone were Anglatisporites sp , Triporites sp and Polypodiaceoisporites retirugutus with age range of possibly between Valanghian- Barremian. The SII zone at interval of between 1330 m and 2030 m and with age range of Aptian to Albian at the base was defined by Antulsporites baculatus at 2030 m at the top of Well A_O1. This zone was further characterized by the occurrence of Klukisporites sp and Taurocusporites sp at depths of 1330 m and 1690 m in Well A_F1, respectively. The few counts of Bacutriporites sp , Classopollis sp , Polyangulatisporites sp were also recorded within the zone. The palynoflora assemblages were quantitatively dominated by brackish to fresh water swamp species such as Laevigatosporites sp , Polypodiaceoisporites sp with moderate counts of forest species such as Saptaceoideapollenite sp . The environment of deposition of the sediments was brackish to fresh water. Keywords : Palynology, Paleoenvironment, Biozonation, Orange Basin, Palynoflora",2014,Ife Journal of Science
"Intrinsic dissolution rate and solubility studies on josamycin, a macrolide antibiotic","Abstract The effect of pH on the intrinsic dissolution rate and solubility of josamycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has been investigated to determine the possible effects of the gastro-intestinal pH on absorption. The intrinsic dissolution rate ( G ) was determined in various dissolution media over a pH range of 1.2â€“7.5 using a disc rotated at 50, 100, 200 and 300 rpm at each pH. The intrinsic dissolution rate at infinite rotation speed ( G âˆž ) was determined using an extrapolation procedure described previously (Nicklasson and Brodin, Acta Pharm. Suec. , 19 (1982) 109â€“118). A plot of log G âˆž vs time was linear (linear regression equation y = 1.4288 âˆ’ 0.6007 x , correlation coeffiecient = 0.9904) with values of G âˆž ranging by a factor of > 8500 from a maximum of 5.16 mg cm âˆ’2 s âˆ’1 at pH 1.2 to 5.81 Ã— 10 âˆ’4 mg cm âˆ’2 s âˆ’1 at pH 7.5. Furthermore, comparison of G âˆž values with limits suggested by Kaplan ( Drug Metab. Rev. , 1 (1972) 15â€“34) indicates that the absorption of josamycin could be dissolution rate-limited from an environment of pH 5.4 to 7.0, and is highly likely to be dissolution rate-limited from intestinal fluid at pH values above 7.0. The solubility of josamycin was equally dependent on pH and ranged from 212 mg ml âˆ’1 (21%) at pH 5.45 to 0.18 mg ml âˆ’1 (0.018%) at pH 9.0. Josamycin has a solubility of approx. 1% at pH 6.0 and decreases with increasing pH to approx. 0.019% at pH 8.5. This suggests that the absorption of josamycin may also be solubility rate-limited particularly from an intestinal environment of pH 6.0 and above.",1992,International Journal of Pharmaceutics
Genome Size and Seed Mass Analyses in Cicer arietinum (Chickpea) and Wild Cicer Species,"The genome size of cultivated Cicer arietinum and 12 wild Cicer sp. including seven annual and five perennial species were analyzed using flow cytometry. A significant 2C genome size variation was observed among the Cicer sp. The 2C genome size ranged from 1.00 pg in wild species, Cicer judaicum, to 1.76 pg in cultivated species, C. arietinum. The wild perennial species all had a genome size ofâ€™1.6 pg. Most if not all of this genome size variation occurred among wild annual species. A significant positive correlation between 2C genome size and seed mass was observed among 12 wild Cicer sp. at a = 0.05. However, artificial selection appears to decrease nucleotype effects in cultivated C. arietinum, which resulted in no correlation between seed mass and genome size at a = 0.05. The genus Cicer belongs to family Leguminoseae, subfamily Papilionaceae, tribe Cicereae, and is well known for the cultivated taxon, C. arietinum or chickpea. Cicer arietinum is the second most widely grown annual legume crop in the world, and has been mainly cultivated in the Indian subcontinent, West Asia, North Africa, America, and Australia (Singh et al., 2008). Besides the cultivated species, this genus is known to have 43 wild species including 8 annual and 35 perennial species (Singh et al., 2008, 2014; van der Maesen, 1987). The wild Cicer sp. are commonly found in West Asia and North Africa covering Turkey in the north to Ethiopia in the south, and Pakistan in the east to Morocco in the west (Singh et al., 2008). The wild annual species such as Cicer reticulatum, Cicer echinospermum, Cicer pinnatifidum, C. judaicum, Cicer bijugum, and Cicer cuneatum are being used in breeding programs to expand chickpea genetic diversity (Ladizinsky and Adler, 1976; Pundir and Mengesha, 1995; Pundir and van der Maesen, 1983; Singh and Ocampo, 1993; van der Maesen, 1980). Knowledge of genetic relationships between the cultivatedC. arietinum and its wild relatives plays an important role in assessing the origin of C. arietinum and in using its close relatives to facilitate the transfer of agonomically useful traits into cultivated species (Singh et al., 2008). Karyotype studies in these Cicer sp. have been well documented (Galasso et al., 1996; Ladizinsky and Adler, 1976; Ohri and Pal, 1991) and showed that annual and perennial species consistently have the same chromosome number 2n = 16, with base chromosome number of 8 (Ladizinsky and Adler, 1976; Singh and Jauhar, 2005). Also, studies have reported nuclear DNA contents of annualCicer sp. (Table 1) (Arumuganathan and Earle, 1991; Galasso et al., 1996; Ohri and Pal, 1991; Ruperao et al., 2014). Despite the constant chromosome number, the amount of DNA in the species has been reported to range from 1.53 to 3.57 pg per 2C nucleus (Arumuganathan and Earle, 1991; Galasso et al., 1996; Ohri and Pal, 1991; Ruperao et al., 2014). Although this could be due to intrachromosomal DNA variation, a concomitant chromosome size variation was not observed by the previous study (Ladizinsky and Adler, 1976). This leads to speculation that there may be errors in reporting genome size variation in the genus Cicer. Giving credence to this hypothesis is that two different 2C genome sizes have been reported in C. arietinum. Ohri and Pal (1991) and Galasso et al. (1996) obtained 3.57 and 3.29 pg for 2C genome sizes of C. arietinum, respectively, whereas Arumuganathan and Earle (1991) and Ruperao et al. (2014) reported 1.53 and 1.77 pg, respectively. Given these discrepancies in the literature, it would be prudent to confirm which, if any, of these estimates is more accurate. Such estimates are critical when correlating genome size variation with phenotypic variation. The variation in genome size influences numerous cellular parameters such as chromosome size, nuclear volume, and cellular volume (Bennett, 1987; Grant, 1987), which has been called nucleotype effects (Bennett, 1972). The nucleotype effects can cause variation in phenotypic traits such as seed mass, and many previous studies have investigated the nucleotype effects on seed size and mass (Beaulieu et al., 2007; Bennett, 1987; Benor et al., 2010; Biradar et al., 1994; Chung et al., 1998; Knight and Ackerly, 2002). Most of the previous studies have indicated a positive relationship between genome size and seedmass within species and across species from the same genus and family (Benor et al., 2010; Biradar et al., 1994; Chung et al., 1998; Knight and Ackerly, 2002). However, in some cases, triangular (Bennett, 1987) and quadratic types of relationship between genome size and seed size (Beaulieu et al., 2007) were revealed in 1222 angiosperm species including, Alluium and Vicia, with species with large genomes tending to have large seed mass, whereas species with small genome sizes having either large or small seed mass. However, the correlation between genome size and seedmassmay be disrupted by years of selective breeding/ artificial selection. According to previous studies (Doebley et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2015), during the domestication of crops, the nucleotide diversity associated with the selected trait in crops is expected to be lower than that of the wild crops, due to strong selective cultivars over many years of generations. A similar result has been observed in cultivated C. arietinum. Seeds of C. arietinum can be phenotypically classified into two seed types: desi (small angular and dark colored) and kabuli (large owl-shaped cream colored) (Choudhary et al., 2012; van der Maesen, 1972). The desi types are mostly distributed in the Indian subcontinent, whereas the kabuli types are grown in the Mediterranean regions. Despite geographic divergence and phenotype differences, no significant difference in DNA content between the two seed types of C. arietinum were observed by Ohri and Pal (1991). However, until the issues of genome size estimates inC. arietinum are resolved, the reported nonassociation between genome size and seed type can be questioned. It is also important to examine the relationship between genome size and seed mass across wild Cicer sp. for developing an understanding of nucleotype effects with regard to artificial and natural selection in Cicer sp. In this study, we used flow cytometry to analyze nuclear DNA content of 13 Cicer sp. to provide valuable new genomic information for both genomic analysis and plant breeding strategies for cultivated plant improvement. Seed type and mass of Cicer sp. were investigated, and then the relationship between genome size and seed type/mass was examined within groups of cultivated C. arietinum and wild Cicer sp.

Between Anarchy and Hierarchy: Nat Loveâ€™s and Theodore Rooseveltâ€™s Manly Feelings,"Nat Loveâ€™s 1907 memoir, The Life and Adventures of Nat Love, contains a well-known and often-reproduced photograph of the author, dressed up as a cowboy with all of the ubiquitous accessories: saddle, lasso, bandana, hat, chaps, revolver, and rifle (figure 2.1). Love claims to be the real-life model for â€œDeadwood Dick,â€ and while this claim is unsubstantiated, it does give a new meaning to the dime-novel heroâ€™s black leather costume since Love, himself, was an African American born into slavery who, after emancipation, eventually made his way West to work as a cowboy. While in dime novels flexible, heroic masculinity remains bound to whiteness, Love demonstrates that cowboy masculinity can cross racial as well as class boundaries. Made in a studio with a decorative screen behind the figure, this photograph evidences the enigmatic power of cowboy masculinity in the turn-of-the-century United States. Loveâ€™s relaxed posture resonates the calm confidence often associated with the Western hero. Notably, this heroic stature is produced through Loveâ€™s use of cowboy accessories. His leg rests on his saddle, one thumb hooks into his ammunition belt, and his hand rests atop his rifle. Like T. S. Eliotâ€™s â€œStetsonâ€ or Deadwood Dickâ€™s â€œkid gloves,â€ fashion constructs cowboy masculinity, and this cowboy masculinity connotes strength and mobility.",2011,
A Multi-Stage Framework for Dantzig Selector and LASSO,"We consider the following sparse signal recovery (or feature selection) problem: given a design matrix X âˆˆ RnÃ—m (m â‰« n) and a noisy observation vector y âˆˆ Rn satisfying y = XÎ²* + e where e is the noise vector following a Gaussian distribution N(0,Ïƒ2I), how to recover the signal (or parameter vector) Î²* when the signal is sparse? 
 
The Dantzig selector has been proposed for sparse signal recovery with strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage Dantzig selector method, which iteratively refines the target signal Î²*. We show that if X obeys a certain condition, then with a large probability the difference between the solution Î² estimated by the proposed method and the true solution Î²* measured in terms of the lp norm (p â‰¥ 1) is bounded as ||Î²-Î²*||p â‰¤ (C(s-N)1/pâˆšlog m + Î”)Ïƒ, where C is a constant, s is the number of nonzero entries in Î²*, the risk of the oracle estimator Î” is independent of m and is much smaller than the first term, and N is the number of entries of Î²* larger than a certain value in the order of O(Ïƒâˆšlog m). The proposed method improves the estimation bound of the standard Dantzig selector approximately from Cs1/p âˆšlogmÏƒ to C(s-N)1/pâˆšlogmÏƒ where the value N depends on the number of large entries in Î²*. When N = s, the proposed algorithm achieves the oracle solution with a high probability, where the oracle solution is the projection of the observation vector y onto true features. In addition, with a large probability, the proposed method can select the same number of correct features under a milder condition than the Dantzig selector. Finally, we extend this multi-stage procedure to the LASSO case.",2012,J. Mach. Learn. Res.

The authors review the main types of processing classically used in survival analysis (exploratory data analysis, regression models), providing a broad panorama of conceptual schemata, including multiple outcomes models (analyses of different exits from unemployment, for example) and repeated events models (the birth of a new child in fertility histories, for example). They also mention methodologies seldom presented in connection with this type of data: algorithmic segmentation techniques (CART models) and variable selection machine learning techniques (boosting). Chapter 1 presents the main concepts and several data sets that use the discrete framework and lists the advantages of methodologies developed for it: the tied events problem that arises with several proportional hazards models, use of the general linear model, simplified interpretation of the hazard ratio (instantaneous risk). Chapter 2 discusses widely used nonparametric types of analysis, lengthof-stay tables and Kaplan-Meier analyses. The mathematic formulas are clearly explained, as are the indicators selected from demographic length-of-stay tables. Bibliographical references, functions, and packages to use with R programs are included after each section, together with exercises that apply the chapterâ€™s main concepts. Chapter 3 reviews the different types of regression models, each applied to an example, and discusses them critically. It includes a comparison with the continuous framework, together with discussions on using the Cox model. The case of time-varying covariates is also discussed in detail. But it is surprising to see no reference here to Paul D. Allisonâ€™s work. Chapter 4, a comprehensive continuation of Chapter 3, presents various tools for testing predictor significance or a modelâ€™s predictive performance. Chapter 5 further extends this presentation, applying more complex models whose effect on risk predictors may not be linear. Chapter 6 raises the question of possible interactions between predictor variables and introduces segmentation techniques (regression trees, CART method) for processing survival data collected in discrete time. Various result stabilization techniques (bagging, random forests) are explained and adapted to survival data. Chapter 7 discusses the question of variable selection (lasso method, boosting). book Reviews",2018,Population
Experimental investigation of transverse spin asymmetries in muon-p SIDIS processes: Sivers asymmetries,"The COMPASS Collaboration at CERN has measured the transver se spin azimuthal asymmetry of charged hadrons produced in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering using a 160 GeV Î¼+ beam and a transversely polarised NH 3 target. The Sivers asymmetry of the proton has been extracte d in the Bjorkenx range 0.003< x < 0.7. The new measurements have small statistical and systemat ic uncertainties of a few percent and confirm with considerably be tter accuracy the previous COMPASS measurement. The Sivers asymmetry is found to be compatible w th zero for negative hadrons and positive for positive hadrons, a clear indication of a spinorbit coupling of quarks in a transversely polarised proton. As compared to measurements at lower ener gy, a smaller Sivers asymmetry for positive hadrons is found in the region x > 0.03. The asymmetry is different from zero and positive also in the lowx region, where seaâ€“quarks dominate. The kinematic dependen ce of the asymmetry has also been investigated and results are given for various intervals of hadron and virtual photon fractional energy. In contrast to the case of the Collins asy mmetry, the results on the Sivers asymmetry suggest a strong dependence on the four-momentum transf e to the nucleon, in agreement with the most recent calculations.

Hour-ahead solar PV power forecasting using SVR based approach,"The use of solar photovoltaic (PV) in power generation has grown in the last decade. Unlike the traditional power generation methods (i.e. oil and gas), the solar output power is fluctuating and uncertain, mainly due to clouds movement and other weather factors. Therefore, in order to have a stable power grid, the electricity utilities need to forecast the solar output power, so they can prepare ahead adequately. In this work, hour-ahead solar PV power forecasting is performed using Support Vector Regression (SVR), Polynomial Regression and Lasso. The implemented regression models were tested under different feature selection schemes. These features include weather conditions (i.e. sky condition, temperature, etc.), power generated in the last few hours, day and time information. Based on the comparative results obtained, the SVR forecasting model outperforms the other two models in terms of accuracy.",2017,2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)
SimiC: A Single Cell Gene Regulatory Network Inference method with Similarity Constraints,"Motivation With the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technologies, it is now possible to acquire gene expression data for each individual cell in samples containing up to millions of cells. These cells can be further grouped into different states along an inferred cell differentiation path, which are potentially characterized by similar, but distinct enough, gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Hence, it would be desirable for scRNA-Seq GRN inference methods to capture the GRN dynamics across cell states. However, current GRN inference methods produce a unique GRN per input dataset (or independent GRNs per cell state), failing to capture these regulatory dynamics. Results We propose a novel single-cell GRN inference method, named SimiC, that jointly infers the GRNs corresponding to each state. SimiC models the GRN inference problem as a LASSO optimization problem with an added similarity constraint, on the GRNs associated to contiguous cell states, that captures the inter-cell-state homogeneity. We show on a mouse hepatocyte single-cell data generated after partial hepatectomy that, contrary to previous GRN methods for scRNA-Seq data, SimiC is able to capture the transcription factor (TF) dynamics across liver regeneration, as well as the cell-level behavior for the regulatory program of each TF across cell states. In addition, on a honey bee scRNA-Seq experiment, SimiC is able to capture the increased heterogeneity of cells on whole-brain tissue with respect to a regional analysis tissue, and the TFs associated specifically to each sequenced tissue. Availability SimiC is written in Python and includes an R API. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/jianhao2016/simicLASSO_git.

Specific Effect of Trace Metals on Marine Heterotrophic Microbial Activity and Diversity: Key Role of Iron and Zinc and Hydrocarbon-Degrading Bacteria,"Marine microbes are an important control on the biogeochemical cycling of trace metals, but simultaneously, these metals can control the growth of microorganisms and the cycling of major nutrients like C and N. However, studies on the response/limitation of microorganisms to trace metals have traditionally focused on the response of autotrophic phytoplankton to Fe fertilization. Few reports are available on the response of heterotrophic prokaryotes to Fe, and even less to other biogeochemically relevant metals. We performed the first study coupling dark incubations with next generation sequencing to specifically target the functional and phylogenetic response of heterotrophic prokaryotes to Fe enrichment. Furthermore, we also studied their response to Co, Mn, Ni, Zn, Cu (individually and mixed), using surface and deep samples from either coastal or open-ocean waters. Heterotrophic prokaryotic activity was stimulated by Fe in surface open-ocean, as well as in coastal, and deep open-ocean waters (where Zn also stimulated). The most susceptible populations to trace metals additions were uncultured bacteria (e.g., SAR324, SAR406, NS9, and DEV007). Interestingly, hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (e.g., Thalassolituus, Marinobacter, and Oleibacter) benefited the most from metal addition across all waters (regions/depths) revealing a predominant role in the cycling of metals and organic matter in the ocean.",2018,Frontiers in Microbiology
Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI-based biomarkers of therapeutic response in triple-negative breast cancer,"To cite: Golden DI, Lipson JA, Telli ML, et al. J Am Med Inform Assoc 2013;20:1059â€“1066. ABSTRACT Objective To predict the response of breast cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using features derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. Materials and methods 60 patients with triplenegative early-stage breast cancer receiving NAC were evaluated. Features assessed included clinical data, patterns of tumor response to treatment determined by DCEâ€“MRI, MRI breast imaging-reporting and data system descriptors, and quantitative lesion kinetic texture derived from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). All features except for patterns of response were derived before chemotherapy; GLCM features were determined before and after chemotherapy. Treatment response was defined by the presence of residual invasive tumor and/ or positive lymph nodes after chemotherapy. Statistical modeling was performed using Lasso logistic regression. Results Pre-chemotherapy imaging features predicted all measures of response except for residual tumor. Feature sets varied in effectiveness at predicting different definitions of treatment response, but in general, pre-chemotherapy imaging features were able to predict pathological complete response with area under the curve (AUC)=0.68, residual lymph node metastases with AUC=0.84 and residual tumor with lymph node metastases with AUC=0.83. Imaging features assessed after chemotherapy yielded significantly improved model performance over those assessed before chemotherapy for predicting residual tumor, but no other outcomes. Conclusions DCEâ€“MRI features can be used to predict whether triple-negative breast cancer patients will respond to NAC. Models such as the ones presented could help to identify patients not likely to respond to treatment and to direct them towards alternative therapies.",2013,
Shrinkage and Sparse Estimation for High-Dimensional Linear Models,"In this paper, the high-dimensional sparse linear regression model is considered, where the overall number of variables is larger than the number of observations. Many penalized regularization approaches including LASSO, group LASSO, and Elastic-Net, typically focus on selecting variables with strong effects. This may result in biased prediction, especially when weak signals outnumber strong signals. To solve this problem, we incorporate weak signals in variable selection and estimation. We propose a two-stage procedure, consisting of variable selection and post-selection estimation. The variable selection is done using the LASSO and Elastic-Net penalties to detect weak signals, whereas the post-selection estimation involves by shrinking a post-selection weighted ridge estimator in the direction of a selected candidate subset from the first stage. Monte-Carlo simulation experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of each estimator in terms of the relative mean squared error. As a particular example, we apply the proposed method to analyze the GDP growth data.",2019,
Atom Selection in Continuous Dictionaries: Reconciling Polar and SVD Approximations,"This paper deals with efficient atom selection procedure in a continuous dictionary, as required for instance in a Frank-Wolfe approach within a BLASSO problem for the one-dimensional deconvolution problem. We show that efficient maximization of a correlation between any given vector and an atom sweeping a continuous dictionary can be performed through a particular piece-wise linear approximation of dictionaries: the polar approximation. We finally identify the polar approximation as being optimal in a mean square error sense for dictionaries with raised-cosine Toeplitz kernels.",2019,"ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
"Identification of 102 Correlations between Serum Metabolites and Habitual Diet in a Metabolomics Study of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Trial.","BACKGROUND
Metabolomics has proven useful for detecting objective biomarkers of diet that may help to improve dietary measurement. Studies to date, however, have focused on a relatively narrow set of lipid classes.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to uncover candidate dietary biomarkers by identifying serum metabolites correlated with self-reported diet, particularly metabolites in underinvestigated lipid classes, e.g. triglycerides and plasmalogens.


METHODS
We assessed dietary questionnaire data and serum metabolite correlations from 491 male and female participants aged 55-75 y in an exploratory cross-sectional study within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Self-reported intake was categorized into 50 foods, food groups, beverages, and supplements. We examined 522 identified metabolites using 2 metabolomics platforms (Broad Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital). Correlations were identified using partial Pearson's correlations adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, study site, and total energy intake [Bonferroni-corrected level of 0.05/(50Â Ã—Â 522) = 1.9Â Ã—Â 10-6]. We assessed prediction of dietary intake by multiple-metabolite linear models with the use of 10-fold crossvalidation least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression.


RESULTS
Eighteen foods, beverages, and supplements were correlated with â‰¥1 serum metabolite at the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold, for a total of 102 correlations. Of these, only 5 have been reported previously, to our knowledge. Our strongest correlations were between citrus and proline betaine (rÂ =Â 0.55), supplements and pantothenic acid (rÂ =Â 0.46), and fish and C40:9Â phosphatidylcholine (PC) (rÂ =Â 0.35). The multivariate analysis similarly found reasonably large correlations between metabolite profiles and citrus (rÂ =Â 0.59), supplements (rÂ =Â 0.57), and fish (rÂ =Â 0.44).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study of PLCO participants identified many novel food-metabolite associations and replicated 5 previous associations. These candidate biomarkers of diet may help to complement measures of self-reported diet in nutritional epidemiology studies, though further validation work is still needed.",2019,The Journal of nutrition
Infinite-State Liveness-to-Safety via Implicit Abstraction and Well-Founded Relations,"We present a fully-symbolic LTL model checking approach for infinite-state transition systems. We extend liveness-to-safety, a prominent approach in the finite-state case, by means of implicit abstraction, to effectively prove the absence of abstract fair loops without explicitly constructing the abstract state space. We increase the effectiveness of the approach by integrating termination techniques based on well-founded relations derived from ranking functions. The idea is to prove that any existing abstract fair loop is covered by a given set of well-founded relations. Within this framework, \(k\)-liveness is integrated as a generic ranking function. The algorithm iterates by attempting to remove spurious abstract fair loops: either it finds new predicates, to avoid spurious abstract prefixes, or it introduces new well-founded relations, based on the analysis of the abstract lasso. The implementation fully leverages the efficiency and incrementality of the underlying safety checker IC3ia. The proposed approach outperforms other temporal checkers on a wide class of benchmarks.",2016,
"Lengthâ€“weight relationships for 21 coastal fish species of the Azores, north-eastern Atlantic","Abstract Lengthâ€“weight relationships were estimated for 21 coastal fish species of the Azores, namely Abudefduf luridus, Bothus podas, Chromis limbata, Coris julis, Diplodus sargus, Echiichthys vipera, Gaidropsarus guttatus, Labrus bergylta, Mullus surmuletus, Phycis phycis, Pomatomus saltator, Sarda sarda, Scorpaena maderensis, Scorpaena notata, Seriola rivoliana, Serranus atricauda, Sparisoma cretense, Sphyraena viridensis, Synodus saurus, Thalassoma pavo and Trachinotus ovatus . Significant lengthâ€“weight relationships were found for all species. Sexual dimorphism did not affect the lengthâ€“weight relationships, except in the cases of S. cretense and C. julis . Lengthâ€“length equations for converting size measurements (standard length (SL) and fork length (FL) to total length (TL)) are also presented for all fish species.",2001,Fisheries Research
"Co-ordination of land exploitation, exploitable farmland reserves and national planning in China","Abstract Land exploitation, as an important strategy to mitigate farmland loss and stabilize grain production, has been adopted to compensate farmland loss due to rapid urbanization in China. Bounded by the limited capacity and obvious spatial variations of national farmland reserves, it is essential to arrange land exploitation activities timely and reasonably. In this study, we propose an indicator for the status of regional land exploitation, the Exploitation Degree, to facilitate an overview of land exploitation programs in China at both provincial and prefectural levels based on project data from 2006 to 2012. To further our understanding of the regional features of land exploitation activities, we employ the Lasso model to identify and quantitatively assess influencing factors on land exploitation. Our study shows that: (1) contemporary land exploitation practices in China are significantly inconsistent across exploitable farmland reserves. Some areas are greatly over-exploited and such irrational land exploitation has been persistent; (2) related national land plans designed to guide land exploitation efforts centered on resource-rich regions and critical areas do not function as intended. Therefore, we suggest that Chinaâ¿¿s land exploitation policy shall be improved by reconsidering the orientation of land exploitation policy, coordinating land exploitation activities with productivity improvements and eco-system protection, and enhancing the power and scope of the plans in controlling and guiding land resource management.",2016,Land Use Policy
Regularization in Finite-Sample System Identification,"Finite-sample system identification (FSID) methods infer properties of stochastic dynamical systems under minimal distributional assumptions; typically they build confidence regions with rigorous non-asymptotic guarantees. Similarly to bootstrap and Monte Carlo approaches, they generate alternative samples based on some mild regularities of the random elements of the system. An arch-typical example of such regularities is the case, when the noise sequence has a jointly symmetric distribution about zero. Sign-Perturbed Sums and, its generalizations, Data Perturbation (DP) methods are recently developed FSID algorithms that can construct exact confidence regions for finite samples. They have a number of additional favorable properties, e.g., the confidence sets of SPS for linear regression problems are star convex with the least-squares estimate as a star center, as well as they are strongly consistent, meaning that the regions shrink around the true parameter, and asymptotically cannot contain false parameters (w.p.1). Regularization is an important tool in regression which helps, for example, to handle ill-posed and ill-conditioned problems, reduce over-fitting, enforce sparsity, and in general to control the shape and smoothness of the regression function. The talk will address ways to incorporate regularization techniques to FSID constructions, from standard approaches like Tikhonov regularization (ridge regression), LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), and elastic nets to regularization with suitably chosen Hilbert space norms, which also have important applications in machine learning.",2018,
Magnetic Lasso: A New Kinematic Solar Wind Propagation Method,"Solar wind propagation from the point of measurement to an arbitrary target in the heliosphere is an important input for heliospheric, planetary and cometary studies. In this paper a new kinematic propagation method, the magnetic lasso method is presented. Compared to the simple ballistic approach our method is based on reconstructing the ideal Parker spiral connecting the target with the Sun by testing a previously defined range of heliographic longitudes. The model takes into account the eventual evolution of streamâ€“stream interactions and handles these with a simple model based on the dynamic pressure difference between the two streams. Special emphasis is given to input data cleaning by handling interplanetary coronal mass ejection events as data gaps due to their different propagation characteristics. The solar wind bulk velocity is considered radial and constant. Density and radial magnetic field are propagated by correcting with the inverse square of the radial distance. The model has the advantage that it can be coded easily and fitted to the problem; itÂ is flexible in selecting and handling input data and requires little running time.",2018,Solar Physics
La destrucciÃ³n de la Biblioteca Casa de VelÃ¡zquez de Madrid durante la Guerra Civil espaÃ±ola y su posterior reconstrucciÃ³n,"espanolLa Biblioteca de la Casa de Velazquez - situada en la Ciudad Universitaria de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid - fue inaugurada el 20 de noviembre de 1928, unos anos antes del estallido de la Guerra Civil espanola, cuyo epicentro en la capital de Espana fue el recien inaugurado campus universitario. La linea del frente estaba a menos de 300 metros de la Casa y de su biblioteca. Nada se conservo de ella: ni su fondo patrimonial, ni sus catalogos, ni sus libros de registro; pues desde los primeros dias de la contienda en Madrid fue bombardeada e incendiada. Un fotografo frances - que acompanaba en la retaguardia a los soldados del ejercito de Franco - fotografio el estado de absoluto deterioro de la Casa de Velazquez al final de la contienda. A principios de los anos 50 se acordo reconstruirla en su emplazamiento original. El 14 de mayo de 1959 se volvio a inaugurar la Casa de Velazquez y, con ella, su biblioteca. Se invirtieron dos anos para aprovisionarla mediante la compra y la donacion de particulares. Destaca entre todas la realizada por el bibliofilo espanol Miguel Lasso de la Vega y Lopez de Tejada (marques del Saltillo) en marzo de 1957 EnglishThe Library of the Casa de Velazquez - Located at the University City of Complutense University of Madrid - was inaugurated on November 20, 1928, a few years before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, centered in the capital of Spain was the newly academic campus. The front fine was less than 300 meters from La Casa and its library. Nothing was kept from it: nor its endowment, or catalogs, or their logbooks; for since the early days of the war in Madrid was bombed and burned. A French photographer - in lhe rear which accompanied the soldiers of the army of Franco - photographed the state of absolute deterioration of the Casa de Velazquez at the end of the war. In the early 50s it was decided to rebuild it in its original location. On May 14, 1959 he turned to inaugurate the Casa de Velazquez and with it, his library. Two years have been spent to make deliveries by purchasing and donating individuals.

Major progress has been made in defining the structure of COPI coats, in vitro and in vivo, at resolutions as high as 9 A. Nevertheless, important questions remain unanswered, including what specific interactions stabilize COPI coats, how COPI vesicles recognize their target membranes, and how coat disassembly is coordinated with vesicle fusion and cargo delivery. Here, we use X-ray crystallography to identify a conserved site on the COPI subunit Î±-COP that binds to flexible, acidic sequences containing a single tryptophan residue. One such sequence, found within Î±-COP itself, mediates Î±-COP homo-oligomerization. Another such sequence is contained within the lasso of the ER-resident Dsl1 complex, where it helps mediate the tethering of Golgi-derived COPI vesicles at the ER membrane. Together, our findings suggest that Î±-COP homo-oligomerization plays a key role in COPI coat stability, with potential implications for the coordination of vesicle tethering, uncoating, and fusion.",2019,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Distributionally Robust Groupwise Regularization Estimator,"Regularized estimators in the context of group variables have been applied successfully in model and feature selection in order to preserve interpretability. We formulate a Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem which recovers popular estimators, such as Group Square Root Lasso (GSRL). Our DRO formulation allows us to interpret GSRL as a game, in which we learn a regression parameter while an adversary chooses a perturbation of the data. We wish to pick the parameter to minimize the expected loss under any plausible model chosen by the adversary - who, on the other hand, wishes to increase the expected loss. The regularization parameter turns out to be precisely determined by the amount of perturbation on the training data allowed by the adversary. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven (statistical) criterion for the optimal choice of regularization, which we evaluate asymptotically, in closed form, as the size of the training set increases. Our easy-to-evaluate regularization formula is compared against cross-validation, showing good (sometimes superior) performance.",2017,
Gender differences in correlations of regional white matter integrity with intelligence factor scores,"Studies have shown a correlation between white matter and intelligence. Previous work has shown a gender effect on these correlations. In this study we looked at correlations between regional white matter integrity as measured using MR Diffusion Tensor Imaging and intelligence factor scores in 40 normal control subjects. Method Subjects: The subjects were screened for medical and psychiatric illnesses including a history of head injury and substance abuse. Included were 21 males and 19 females, aged 18-35 years (mean age = 26.6, SD = 4.9; mean age for male is 26 and for female is 27). The subjects completed eight tests of the Johnson Oâ€™Connor Research Foundation: Inductive Speed (IS), Analytical Reasoning (AR), Number Series (NS), Number Facility (NF), Wiggly Block (WB), Paper Folding (PF), VerbalAssociative Memory (VAM), and Number Memory (NM). Previous research (1) showed that these tests load on four factors â€“ Speed of Reasoning (IS and AR), Numerical (NS and NF), Spatial (WB and PF), and Memory (VAM and NM) in addition to a g-factor. These tests have been used in research on various aspects of cognition and intelligence (2) . For the present study, test scores were separated for sex and age in order to eliminate nuisance variance. Imaging: Imaging was performed using a Siemens 3T Allegra MRI. DTI data were acquired using a pulsed-gradient spin-echo sequence with EPI-acquisition (TR=4100ms, TE=80ms, FOV=21cm, matrix =128x128, 28 slices, thickness=3mm skip 1mm, b-factor=1250 s/mm 2 , 12 gradient directions, 5 averages). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and directional color maps were computed using in-house software written in Matlab v7. Region of Interests (ROIs) were defined on color-coded tract directional maps by two independent raters and then averaged. Portions of the following white matter tracts were surveyed using ROIs: Cingulum Bundle, Internal Capsule, Corpus Callosum, Forceps Minor, Forceps Major, Inferior- and Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus and cortical spinal tract (Fig 1). The ROI voxel locations were used to extract the FA values, then transferred to Statistica V7.1 and merged with intelligence factor scores for correlation analysis. Results Significant correlations were found between several of the white matter tracts with the cognitive performance scores. Males: Cingulum bundle showed significant positive correlations with Reasoning-factor scores: Anterior Cingulum bundle (left: r=0.465, p<0.034), (right: r=0.496, p<0.022). Dorsal cingulum bundle (left: r=0.706, p<0.000), (right: r=0.510, p<0.018). Corpus Callosum showed significant negative correlations with different factor scores: Genu: negative correlations with Spatial factor scores (r=-0.507, p<0.019) Splenium: negative correlations with Numerical factors scores (r=-0.457, p<0.037) Forceps Major: negative correlations with g-Factor: (left: r=-0.533, p<0.013), (right: r=-0.4483, p<0.042). Females: Genu of corpus callosum was positively correlated with Memory factor scores (r=0.561, p<0.012). Left Forceps Major was positively correlated with g-Factor. Conclusions Several significant positive as well as negative correlations were detected. The locations of these correlations were also consistent with the functional architecture and the factor scores with which they were correlated. The cingulum bundle, a white matter tract inside the cingulate gyrus was positively correlated with the reasoning factor scores. The cingulate gyrus is an area in the brain that is involved with early learning and problem solving, anticipation of tasks, motivation, and modulation of emotional responses (3) . The general notion of lateralization of certain functions, such as visual-spatial ability is predominantly a right brain function whereas analytical skills reside mostly in the left brain, can also be explained by the correlations in the interhemispheric connections. Significant negative correlations with spatial and numerical factor scores were found in various areas of the corpus callosum. This supports the efficiency model (4) : pruning of inefficient connections is essential to brain development. One interpretation of these negative correlations is that they represent interference from the contralateral side of the brain. The only significant correlation detected in females were in the corpus callosum area. These correlations were positive. These findings are also consistent with a recent report on DTI/IQ correlations on a cohort of subjects aged 5-18 where correlations were mainly negative in males and positive in females as they got older",2009,
Delayed Metamorphosis with Reduced Larval Growth in a Coral Reef Fish ( Thalassoma bifasciatum ),"Analyses of daily otolith increment sequences in the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, from the San Blas Islands of Panama indicated that (1) the duration of the planktonic larval period of this species ranges from 38 to 78â€‚d, (2) those larvae with extended larval durations reach settlement size at the same age as average individuals but then remain planktonic for several more weeks, and (3) the estimated larval growth rate during this period of delayed metamorphosis (0.08â€‚mmâˆ™dâˆ’1) is distinctly lower than both the estimated growth rate before attaining settlement size (0.26â€‚mmâˆ™dâˆ’1) as well as the growth rate of juveniles after settlement (0.31â€‚mmâˆ™dâˆ’1).

IntroductionDithiocarboxylategroups are animportantclassofmultidentateligands known for their unique metal ligand interaction [1e8],organic transformation [9e11] and metal-sulphide nanoparticlesynthesis [12,13]. Although, the synthesis and reactivity of a fewnumber of transition metal dithicarboxylato complexes have beeninvestigated in the last decade [14e18], study on their derivativesand the possibility to introduce more metal binding sites on suchgroups have largely been unexplored. Compounds or ligands withmultisite coordination environment eventually facilitate the syn-thesis of multi-metallic coordinated compounds.

Survival data.,"During recent years, penalized likelihood approaches have attracted a lot of interest both in the area of semiparametric regression and for the regularization of high-dimensional regression models. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian formulation that allows to combine both aspects into a joint regression model with a focus on hazard regression for survival times. While Bayesian penalized splines form the basis for estimating nonparametric and flexible time-varying effects, regularization of highdimensional covariate vectors is based on scale mixture of normals priors. This class of priors allows to keep a (conditional) Gaussian prior for regression coefficients on the predictor stage of the model but introduces suitable mixture distributions for the Gaussian variance to achieve regularization. This scale mixture property allows to device general and adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation algorithms for fitting a variety of hazard regression models. In particular, unifying algorithms based on iteratively weighted least squares proposals can be employed both for regularization and penalized semiparametric function estimation. Since sampling based estimates do no longer have the variable selection property well-known for the Lasso in frequentist analyses, we additionally consider spike and slab priors that introduce a further mixing stage that allows to separate between influential and redundant parameters. We demonstrate the different shrinkage properties with three simulation settings and apply the methods to the PBC Liver dataset.",1995,Archives of disease in childhood
Natural Language-based Machine Learning Models for the Annotation of Clinical Radiology Reports.,"Purpose To compare different methods for generating features from radiology reports and to develop a method to automatically identify findings in these reports. Materials and Methods In this study, 96 303 head computed tomography (CT) reports were obtained. The linguistic complexity of these reports was compared with that of alternative corpora. Head CT reports were preprocessed, and machine-analyzable features were constructed by using bag-of-words (BOW), word embedding, and Latent Dirichlet allocation-based approaches. Ultimately, 1004 head CT reports were manually labeled for findings of interest by physicians, and a subset of these were deemed critical findings. Lasso logistic regression was used to train models for physician-assigned labels on 602 of 1004 head CT reports (60%) using the constructed features, and the performance of these models was validated on a held-out 402 of 1004 reports (40%). Models were scored by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and aggregate AUC statistics were reported for (a) all labels, (b) critical labels, and (c) the presence of any critical finding in a report. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1 score were reported for the best performing model's (a) predictions of all labels and (b) identification of reports containing critical findings. Results The best-performing model (BOW with unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams plus average word embeddings vector) had a held-out AUC of 0.966 for identifying the presence of any critical head CT finding and an average 0.957 AUC across all head CT findings. Sensitivity and specificity for identifying the presence of any critical finding were 92.59% (175 of 189) and 89.67% (191 of 213), respectively. Average sensitivity and specificity across all findings were 90.25% (1898 of 2103) and 91.72% (18 351 of 20 007), respectively. Simpler BOW methods achieved results competitive with those of more sophisticated approaches, with an average AUC for presence of any critical finding of 0.951 for unigram BOW versus 0.966 for the best-performing model. The Yule I of the head CT corpus was 34, markedly lower than that of the Reuters corpus (at 103) or I2B2 discharge summaries (at 271), indicating lower linguistic complexity. Conclusion Automated methods can be used to identify findings in radiology reports. The success of this approach benefits from the standardized language of these reports. With this method, a large labeled corpus can be generated for applications such as deep learning. Â© RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",2018,Radiology
A Nonconvex Variational Approach for Robust Graphical Lasso,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in problems in graph estimation and model selection, which all share very similar matrix variational formulations, the most popular one being probably GLASSO. Unfortunately, the standard GLASSO formulation does not take into account noise corrupting the data: this shortcoming leads us to propose a novel criterion, where the regularization function is decoupled in two terms, one acting only on the eigenvalues of the matrix and the other on the matrix elements. Incorporating noise information into the model has the side-effect to make the cost function non-convex. To overcome this difficulty, we adopt a majorization-minimization approach, where at each iteration a convex approximation of the original cost function is minimized via the Douglas-Rachford procedure. The achieved results are very promising w.r.t. classical approaches.",2018,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Quantile LASSO with changepoints in panel data models applied to option pricing,"Panel data are modern statistical tools which are commonly used in all kinds of econometric problems under various regularity assumptions. The panel data models with changepoints are introduced together with atomic pursuit methods and they are applied to estimate the underlying option price function. Robust estimates and complex insight into the data are both achieved by adopting the quantile LASSO approach. The final model is produced in a fully data-driven manner in just one single modeling step. In addition, the arbitrage-free scenarios are obtained by introducing a set of well defined linear constraints. The final estimate is, under some reasonable assumptions, consistent with respect to the model estimation and the changepoint detection performance. The finite sample properties are investigated in a simulation study and proposed methodology is applied for the Apple call option pricing problem.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
"Ruminant Trichostrongylids by Artl robotrys oligospora, a Predacious Fungus","Sheep and cattle are prey to many parasitic worms, including the trichostrongylid nematodes. Conventional control involves the use of anthelmintic drugs, but in this article HadjJ Abroad Hashmi and Roger Connan discuss the possible biological control of these nematodes by means of a 'livlng lasso', the predacious fungus Arthrobotrys. Trichostrongylid nematodes are a major constraint on the growth of young ruminants. In the early grazing season calves become infected with larvae that have overwintered on the pasture and as a result eggs are subsequently deposited in their faeces. As the season advances, the ambient temperature rises, and eggs develop progressively more successfully and more quickly, and from midsummer a major new peak of infective larvae appears on the pasture ~. Similar events occur on sheep pasture except that the ewes, as well as the lambs contaminate it 2. It is this new generation of infective larvae, appearing in midsummer, which normally causes disease.",1989,
Variational Bayesian Complex Network Reconstruction,"Complex network reconstruction is a hot topic in many fields. A popular data-driven reconstruction framework is based on lasso. However, it is found that, in the presence of noise, it may be inefficient for lasso to determine the network topology. This paper builds a new framework to cope with this problem. The key idea is to employ a series of linear regression problems to model the relationship between network nodes, and then to use an efficient variational Bayesian method to infer the unknown coefficients. Based on the obtained information, the network is finally reconstructed by determining whether two nodes connect with each other or not. The numerical experiments conducted with both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the new method outperforms lasso with regard to both reconstruction accuracy and running speed.",2018,ArXiv
Reducing Sampling Ratios Improves Bagging in Sparse Regression.,"Bagging, a powerful ensemble method from machine learning, improves the performance of unstable predictors. Although the power of Bagging has been shown mostly in classification problems, we demonstrate the success of employing Bagging in sparse regression over the baseline method (L1 minimization). The framework employs the generalized version of the original Bagging with various bootstrap ratios. The performance limits associated with different choices of bootstrap sampling ratio L/m and number of estimates K is analyzed theoretically. Simulation shows that the proposed method yields state-of-the-art recovery performance, outperforming L1 minimization and Bolasso in the challenging case of low levels of measurements. A lower L/m ratio (60% - 90%) leads to better performance, especially with a small number of measurements. With the reduced sampling rate, SNR improves over the original Bagging by up to 24%. With a properly chosen sampling ratio, a reasonably small number of estimates K = 30 gives satisfying result, even though increasing K is discovered to always improve or at least maintain the performance.",2018,arXiv: Machine Learning
To Tie or Not to Tie? That Is the Question,"In this review, we provide an overview of entangled proteins. Around 6% of protein structures deposited in the PBD are entangled, forming knots, slipknots, lassos and links. We present theoretical methods and tools that enabled discovering and classifying such structures. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the non-trivial topology in proteins, based on available data about folding, stability, biological properties and evolutionary conservation. We also formulate intriguing and challenging questions on the border of biophysics, bioinformatics, biology and mathematics, which arise from the discovery of an entanglement in proteins. Finally, we discuss possible applications of entangled proteins in medicine and nanotechnology, such as the chance to design super stable proteins, whose stability could be controlled by chemical potential.",2017,Polymers
ComparaciÃ³ de dos mÃ¨todes dâ€™hidrÃ²lisi Ã cida per estimar lâ€™estabilitat de la matÃ¨ria orgÃ nica en fangs de depuradora,"In Catalunya every year more than three hundred thousand tons of sewage sludge are produced, making its management a priority. One of the ways in which these wastes are given a way out is through their agricultural recovery. In order to give them an agronomic exit, these wastes must meet the requirements set by the Agencia de Residus de Catalunya. Within the requirements set by the regulatory body, a minimum stability is required by the sludge. Several methods exist to measure stability, but l'Agencia Catalana de l'Aigua uses the Klasson method (MAB 1971) to evaluate the sludge generated in Catalunya. The objective of this paper is to compare the degrees of stability obtained by analyzing nine samples of sludge and one of compost using the Klasson method (MAB 1971) and the van Soest method (Binner 1997). With the results obtained, we observe that the stability obtained by the van Soest method (Binner 1997) is significantly lower than that obtained with the Klasson method (MAB 1971). A fact that could be explained by the nitrogen content of the sludge, since Norman and Jenkyns (1934) observed that when samples with a high nitrogen content were treated with the Klasson method, a precipitate was produced that leads to an overestimation of the recalcitrant organic matter content of the sample. That said, we believe that more studies are needed to verify the reliability of the Klasson method (MAB 1971) to determine the stability of organic matter in sewage sludge",2019,
"Vandalism detection in Wikipedia: a high-performing, feature-rich model and its reduction through Lasso","User generated content (UGC) constitutes a significant fraction of the Web. However, some wiiki-based sites, such as Wikipedia, are so popular that they have become a favorite target of spammers and other vandals. In such popular sites, human vigilance is not enough to combat vandalism, and tools that detect possible vandalism and poor-quality contributions become a necessity. The application of machine learning techniques holds promise for developing efficient online algorithms for better tools to assist users in vandalism detection. We describe an efficient and accurate classifier that performs vandalism detection in UGC sites. We show the results of our classifier in the PAN Wikipedia dataset. We explore the effectiveness of a combination of 66 individual features that produce an AUC of 0.9553 on a test dataset -- the best result to our knowledge. Using Lasso optimization we then reduce our feature--rich model to a much smaller and more efficient model of 28 features that performs almost as well -- the drop in AUC being only 0.005. We describe how this approach can be generalized to other user generated content systems and describe several applications of this classifier to help users identify potential vandalism.",2011,
Sparse Super-Resolution from Laplace Measurements,"We propose a theoretical analysis of the super-resolution performance of the BLASSO â€œoff-the-gridâ€ recovery method from Laplace transform measurements. This transform is not translation invariant, thus requiring the use of theoretical and algorithmic tools that go beyond traditional deconvolution-based methods. We show that the BLASSO offers a stable and computationally tractable super-resolution of positive spikes. In particular, when the signal-to-noise ratio is of the order of 1/t2Nâˆ’1 (where t is the spacing between the N spikes to recover), the BLASSO program outputs the correct number of spikes. This result suggests that the BLASSO should be a method of choice to tackle challenging Laplace inversions, which are at the heart of recently proposed fluorescence imaging methods.",2017,
Variable selection in subdistribution hazard frailty models with competing risks data.,"The proportional subdistribution hazards model (i.e. Fine-Gray model) has been widely used for analyzing univariate competing risks data. Recently, this model has been extended to clustered competing risks data via frailty. To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been no literature on variable selection method for such competing risks frailty models. In this paper, we propose a simple but unified procedure via a penalized h-likelihood (HL) for variable selection of fixed effects in a general class of subdistribution hazard frailty models, in which random effects may be shared or correlated. We consider three penalty functions, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and HL, in our variable selection procedure. We show that the proposed method can be easily implemented using a slight modification to existing h-likelihood estimation approaches. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed procedure using the HL penalty performs well, providing a higher probability of choosing the true model than LASSO and SCAD methods without losing prediction accuracy. The usefulness of the new method is illustrated using two actual datasets from multi-center clinical trials.",2014,Statistics in medicine
DÃ©versement des poutres Ã  parois minces et Ã  sections ouvertes : aspect[s] numÃ©riques et rÃ©glementaires,"Torsional behaviour of steel beams is deeply influenced by the shape of the cross section. Thin-walled open profiles, are very common in steel constructions. The classical theory of beams of Saint Venant under-estimates the strength of such profiles. In order to obtain more realistic results, it is necessary to adopt the so-called non-uniform torsion theory of Vlassov. In the first theory, a twisting of such a shaft produce only pure shear stresses. When analysing the torsional behaviour of thin walled beams according to the second theory, we remark that in addition to the shear stresses, the additional normal stresses arising from warping are developed in the cross section. If the beam is loaded in the plane of this weak axis and is not adequately braced lateraly, the beam will bend out of plane and twist when the load has reached a critical value. This phenomenon is known as lateral buckling. The analytical and numerical methods are used to determine the critical load for beams with monosymmetric cross-sections, subjected to transversal loads and moment gradients. The analytical method is obtained from the solution of the differential equations. A general formula to obtain the elastic lateral buckling solution is presented. In the numerical method, we use the Raleigh-Ritz energy approach. Results are presented in terms of the degree of section monosymmetry, slender of the beam and load height parameter. Our results are compared with ABAQUS code and with Eurocode 3 results. The performance of these results are very satifsfactory.",1998,
Mesoscale spatiotemporal predictive models of daily human- and lightning-caused wildland fire occurrence in British Columbia,"We developed three models of daily human- and lightning-caused fire occurrence to support fire management preparedness and detection planning in the province of British Columbia, Canada, using a lasso-logistic framework. Novel aspects of our work involve (1) using an ensemble of models that were created using 500 datasets balanced (through response-selective sampling) to have equal numbers of fire and non-fire observations; (2) the use of a new ranking algorithm to address the difficulty in interpreting variable importance in models with a large number of covariates. We also introduce the use of cause-specific average spatial daily fire occurrence, termed baseline risk, as a covariate for missing or poorly estimated factors that influence human and lightning fire occurrence. All three models have strong predictive ability, with areas under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve exceeding 0.9.",2020,International Journal of Wildland Fire

Different models for prediction of radical cystectomy postoperative complications and care pathways,"Background: Radical cystectomy for bladder cancer has one of the highest rates of morbidity among urologic surgery, but the ability to predict postoperative complications remains poor. Our study objective was to create machine learning models to predict complications and factors leading to extended length of hospital stay and discharge to a higher level of care after radical cystectomy. Methods: Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, peri-operative adverse outcome variables for patients undergoing elective radical cystectomy for bladder cancer from 2005 to 2016 were extracted. Variables assessed include occurrence of minor, infectious, serious, or any adverse events, extended length of hospital stay, and discharge to higher-level care. To develop predictive models of radical cystectomy complications, we fit generalized additive model (GAM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic, neural network, and random forest models to training data using various candidate predictor variables. Each model was evaluated on the test data using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: A total of 7557 patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria, and 2221 complications occurred. LASSO logistic models demonstrated the highest area under curve for predicting any complications (0.63), discharge to a higher level of care (0.75), extended length of stay (0.68), and infectious (0.62) adverse events. This was comparable with random forest in predicting minor (0.60) and serious (0.63) adverse events. Conclusions: Our models perform modestly in predicting radical cystectomy complications, highlighting both the complex cystectomy process and the limitations of large healthcare datasets. Identifying the most important variable leading to each type of adverse event may allow for further strategies to model cystectomy complications and target optimization of modifiable variables pre-operative to reduce postoperative adverse events.",2019,Therapeutic Advances in Urology
"Aspects of the breeding biology of antarctic petrels and southern fulmars in the rauer group, east Antarctica","Breeding phenology, success and nest attendance of Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica and Southem Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides at the Rauer Group (68Â°51â€²S, 77Â°50â€²E), East Antarctica, are discussed. Most data were collected on Hop Island (68Â°50â€²S, 77Â°42â€²E) in January and February 1988, and from December 1988 to March 1989. Observations extended from the late stages of incubation to post-guard or fledging periods. Some annual breeding indices collected from 1983 onwards at census sites are compared with meteorological data and the extent of fast ice for the nearby Davis Station (68Â°35â€²E, 77Â°58â€²E). Both species had a restricted hatching period, reflecting a brief and synchronised egg-laying period, typical of other southem fulmarine petrels. Antarctic Petrel chicks hatched from 4 January (1989), and c. 90% appeared by 16 January (both years). Southern Fulmar hatching began on 21 January (1988) and almost all chicks appeared by 6 February (both years). Adult attendance at nests declined with increasing chick age. For Antarctic Petrels, this was most marked at about 11 days; no chicks had continuously attendant adults after 24 days, although adults returned to feed them. Incubation shifts in Southern Fulmars were longer than shifts following hatching and the post-guard period started, on average, 13 days after hatching. Egg and chick losses varied between years and sites. The South Polar Skua Catharacta maccormicki was apparently involved in the majority of losses. Nest sites of both species resemble those elsewhere: Southern Fulmars may require steeper sites, allowing a fall away from colonies. Antarctic Petrels are less affected by accumulation of snow or ice and shelter from katabatic winds may be important. Although weather may modify breeding success locally, annual success must depend on the ability of parents to produce eggs and feed chicks: this may be moderated by the extent and persistence of pack ice.",1992,Emu
Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation guided by Carto-Merge and Lasso catheters for the treatment of atrial fibrillation,"Objective To study the effect of circumferential pulmonary vein isolation(CPVI) guided by Carto-Merge and Lasso catheter for the treatment of atrial fibrillation(AF).Methods Fifty-six drug refractory patients(41 male) with paroxysmal AF were enrolled into this study with a mean age of(58.5Â±12.7) years.Ostia of pulmonary veins(PVs) were identified by Carto-Merge.Then circumferential pulmonary vein isolation was performed.The endpoint of ablation was abolishment or dissociation of the pulmonary vein potentials(PVPs).Results Mean distance between electroanatomic mapping points and MRI surfaces was(1.79Â±0.33) mm as a whole in this group.Abolishment or dissociation of PVPs was accomplished in 52 patients(92.9%) during the first procedure.After a mean(18.3Â±5.7) months of follow up,41 patients(73.2%) maintained sinus rhythm.Ten patients received a second ablation procedure,and 8 were free of atrial tachyarrhythmias after a mean(8.2Â±6.9) months of the second follow up.No PV stenosis was identified after ablation procedure.Conclusion Combination of Lasso catheters with Carto-Merge to guide the CPVI procedure can confirm the isolation of PVs and lower the incidence of PVs stenosis.",2007,Chinese Journal of Interventional Cardiology
Inherited thrombocytopenia and Occam's razor.,"Background: In the phase 3 ENDEAVOR trial, treatment with carfilzomib administered at 56 mg/m2 twice weekly in combination with dexamethasone (Kd56) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to treatment with bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) (Dimopoulos MA, et al. Lancet Oncol . 2016;17:27-38). In this substudy of ENDEAVOR, we used whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify genes whose baseline expression levels in CD138+ cells were predictive of PFS in patients treated with Kd56 or Vd. The objective of this study was to develop a genomic classifier that could be used to stratify patients for benefit with Kd56 or Vd therapy. Methods: Patients were randomized to receive Kd56 or Vd at a 1:1 ratio. Patients who consented for this biomarker study and provided samples (Kd56, n = 155; Vd, n = 148) were included. CD138+ cells were isolated from bone marrow aspirate collected at baseline. Sequencing libraries for isolated RNA samples were prepared using an Illumina TruSeq RNA library construction kit and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Sequencing reads were aligned against the human reference genome GRCh38 using STAR RNA-seq aligner and annotated with GENCODE v24 at the gene level. Expression counts were estimated using RSEM software and converted to counts per million for subsequent analyses using the edgeR package. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis with LASSO was used to model the relationship between patients9 baseline gene expression and PFS. A classifier was established and its predictive performance was assessed using the cross-validation scheme outlined by Simon et al (Brief Bioinform . 2011;12:203-214). The statistical significance of the cross-validated Kaplan-Meier curves and corresponding log-rank statistic was estimated by generating an approximate null distribution of the cross-validated log-rank statistic through 500 random permutations. For each permutation, the patients9 baseline gene expression profiles and treatment assignments were randomly re-shuffled against patients9 survival times and event indicators, and the same cross-validation procedures used in the model performance assessment were repeated to compute the cross-validated log-rank statistic for the permuted data. Results: Among the 303 Kd56 or Vd patients included in this biomarker study, patients in the Kd56 arm had a 58% reduced risk of progression or death compared with patients in the Vd arm (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.59; P= 4.5 x 10-7). We developed a linearized classifier using patients9 baseline gene expression (n = 303) to stratify patients for PFS benefit from Kd56 or Vd therapy. The cross-validated Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank statistic for the classifier were statistically significant at P Conclusions: We identified a classifier with a set of genes whose baseline expression could potentially be used to stratify RRMM patients for greater treatment benefit with Kd56. As only one patient cohort was used for this study, the classifier identified here should be validated in prospective studies and with independent sets of patient cohorts. Further study of this group of genes may provide additional insights into the biology of multiple myeloma and how mechanism of action differs between carfilzomib and bortezomib.

Sparse Locality Preserving Embedding,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised linear method of variables technique used in data compression, classification, and visualization[1]. The essence of PCA is to extract principal components, linear combinations of input variables that together best account for the variance in a data set. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a favored tool for supervised linear classification in many areas because of its simplicity and robustness[2]. The goal of LDA is to provide low dimensional projections of data onto the most discriminative directions. Locality preserving projection (LPP) is a recently proposed method[3], which can be regarded as the linearization of Laplacian EigenMap[4]. When applied to face recognition tasks, LPP is also called LaplacianFaces. The idea behind LPP is that it considers the manifold structure of the data set, and preserves the locality of data in the embedding space. LPP has shown the superiority in terms of image indexing and face recognition. One of the major disadvantages of these three methods is that the derived projections are linear combinations of all the original features. Hence the learned results are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called sparse locality preserving embedding (SpLPE), which is based on lasso regression framework for learning sparse projections by incorporating c 1 penalty with conventional locality preserving projections. The affinity graph constructed in LPP encodes both discriminant and geometrical structure in the data[3]. Once the Laplacian matrix is computed, we recast the generalized eigenvalue problem of LPP in the lasso regression framework to obtain sparse basis functions. The proposed SpLPE is a combination of locality preserving with sparsity. Additionally, our algorithm can be performed in either supervised or unsupervised mode.",2009,2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing
"A Flexible, Interpretable, and Accurate Approach for Imputing the Expression of Unmeasured Genes","While there are >2 million publicly-available human microarray gene-expression profiles, these profiles were measured using a variety of platforms that each cover a pre-defined, limited set of genes. Therefore, key to reanalyzing and integrating this massive data collection are methods that can computationally reconstitute the complete transcriptome in partially-measured microarray samples by imputing the expression of unmeasured genes. Current state-of-the-art imputation methods are tailored to samples from a specific platform and rely on gene-gene relationships regardless of the biological context of the target sample. We show that sparse regression models that capture sample-sample relationships (termed SampleLASSO), built on-the-fly for each new target sample to be imputed, outperform models based on fixed gene relationships. Extensive evaluation involving three machine learning algorithms (LASSO, k-nearest-neighbors, and deep-neural-networks), two gene subsets (GPL96-570 and LINCS), and three imputation tasks (within and across microarray/RNA-seq) establishes that SampleLASSO is the most accurate model. Additionally, we demonstrate the biological interpretability of this method by showing that, for imputing a target sample from a certain tissue, SampleLASSO automatically leverages training samples from the same tissue. Thus, SampleLASSO is a simple, yet powerful and flexible approach for harmonizing large-scale gene-expression data.",2020,bioRxiv

"Paleogeographic significance of the Cardium, Potamids and Foraminifera living in intra-continental salt lakes of North Africa (Sahara Quaternary, Egypt Present lakes)","The widespread Cardium (Cerastoderma) fauna of Quaternary lakes of the Sahara gave rise to the â€œSaharian seasâ€ hypothesis. Present Egyptian (Fayum, Siwa) and Algerian Holocene salt lakes show an evolution from a fresh water fauna to a Cardium, Potamids and Foraminifera fauna in spite of their considerable distance from the Mediterranean sea and their altitude above sea level. The inevitable conclusion is that thalassoid or so-called margino-littoral faunas cannot be used as indicative of sea connection, or even proximity, in ancient deposits.",1991,Journal of African Earth Sciences
"La pintura de Timantes en el cÃ­rculo cervantino: Pedro de Padilla, Lobo Lasso de la Vega y el Quijote","Most paintings from Antiquity, especially Greek ones, have disappeared. Nevertheless, we have descriptions of many of them, mostly in book 35 of Pliny the Elderâ€™s Natural History. This article studies how two paintings by Timanthes described by Pliny appeared as ekphrases in Golden Age poetry. Although there are ekphrases of Timanthes in Garcilaso and Boscan, this article focuses on two poets of the circle of Cervantes: Pedro de Padilla and Lobo Lasso de la Vega. While Padilla includes an ekphrasis of Timanthesâ€™ The Sacrifice of Iphigenia in his eclogues, Lobo Lasso de la Vega penned three poems on Greek painting, including works by Apelles, Parrhasius and Timanthes. Of the latter, he focuses on a lesser-known painting, instead of on The Sacrifice of Iphigenia: The Sleeping Cyclops. After examining these two poets, our article analyses the presence of Timanthes in Cervantesâ€™ Don Quixote. All these texts help us gather the importance of Timanthes and the literary connections his painting created in Golden Age literature.",2017,

Smooth LASSO for Classification,"The sparse model character of 1-norm penalty term of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) can be applied to automatic feature selection. Since 1-norm SVM is also designed with 1-norm (LASSO) penalty term, this study labels it as LASSO for classification. This paper introduces the smooth technique into 1-norm SVM and calls it smooth LASSO for classification (SLASSO) to provide simultaneous classification and feature selection. In the experiments, we compare SLASSO with other approaches of â€œwrapperâ€ and â€œfilterâ€ models for feature selection. Results showed that SLASSO has slightly better accuracy than other approaches with the desirable ability of feature suppression.",2010,2010 International Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence
Potential of genomic selection in perennial crops: preliminary results in the context of Eucalyptus and oil palm breeding : P-180,"The methodology of selection in plant breeding has markedly evolved with the advent of high throughput molecular technology, the increasingly reasonable cost of genotyping, and the implementation of genomic selection (GS). For perennial crops, the potential of GS is high and gives the opportunity to shorten the breeding cycle by selecting at the juvenile stage using marker information. Here we present preliminary results of GS experiments for two perennials crop, Eucalyptus and oil palm, that play an important economical role in tropical regions. In the case of Eucalyptus, a simulation study was developed to test the efficiency of GS in the frame of a recurrent selection scheme for clone production over four breeding cycles. Scenarios crossing broad sense heritabilities (HÂ²=0.6 and 0.1), dominance to additive variance ratios (R=0.1; 0.5 and 1) and training population structure were compared using Bayesian LASSO method. Models including dominance effects are all the more relevant when the R ratio and the training population size are high. The genetic gain per unit time with GS was 1.5 to 3 times higher than with phenotypic selection at mature stage for breeding and clone populations. For oil palm, we implemented a cross-validation approach with 111 individuals of the last generation of a key breeding population, evaluated through progeny tests including 40,000 individuals and genotyped with 140 microsatellites. The accuracy of GS increased when increasing the training population size and reached 0.6-0.7, according to the trait, with a 3:1 ratio for training and validation populations respectively. The small effective population size detected in this breeding population explains the good GS performance even with a limited panel of markers. Our studies based on two perennials crops presenting different biological patterns and different breeding contexts suggest very promising results of GS for long rotation plant species.

Weak genetic structure indicates strong dispersal limits: a tale of two coral reef fish,"The extent of dispersal by pelagic larvae in marine environments, including coral reefs, is central for understanding local population dynamics and designing sustainable marine reserves. We present here the first example of a clear stepping-stone genetic structure throughout the Caribbean basin for a common coral reef species, the French grunt (Haemulon flavolineatum). Analysis of microsatellite DNA markers indicated that French grunt population structure may be characterized by overlapping populations throughout the Caribbean, influenced by independent population dynamics but with no fixed geographical boundaries. In addition, different spatial genetic patterns were found in different oceanographic regions. A second species, the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), has a much longer pelagic larval duration than French grunts and showed no explicit spatial pattern of genetic variation. This finding is concordant with the hypothesis of a positive relationship between larval dispersal and duration in the plankton. While the magnitude of the genetic signal of population structure in French grunts was very low (FSTâ‰ˆ0.003), the pattern of isolation-by-distance throughout the Caribbean indicated considerable population structure with important ecological and conservation significance.",2006,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences
Estimating Disease Burden Using Google Trends and Wikipedia Data,"Data on disease burden is often used for assessing population health, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, formulating health policies, and planning future resource allocation. We investigated whether Internet usage data, particularly the search volume on Google and page view counts on Wikipedia, are correlated with the disease burden, measured by prevalence and treatment cost, for 1,633 diseases over an 11-year period. We also applied the method of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to predict the burden of diseases, using those Internet data together with three other variables we quantified previously. We found a relatively strong correlation for 39 of 1,633 diseases, including viral hepatitis, diabetes mellitus, other headache syndromes, multiple sclerosis, sleep apnea, hemorrhoids, and disaccharidase deficiency. However, an accurate analysis must consider each conditionâ€™s characteristics, including acute/chronic nature, severity, familiarity to the public, and presence of stigma.",2017,
Fishes of the Fourche River in Northcentral Arkansas,"Asurvey of the fishes of Fourche River innorthcentral Arkansas was made between June 1974 and March 1976. Field collections and literature records revealed that the river system was inhabited by 94 species of fish representing 21 families. The collected fishes represent both the Ozark and the lowland faunal groups. Fourteen species of Etheostoma and four species of Percina were collected. The records of Etheostoma asprigene and Elassoma zonatum represent extensions of the previously knownranges of these species within the state. Notums gyrinus and Etheostoma histrio were recorded from the Black River system in Arkansas for the first time since 1894. Predominant highland species of minnows included Campostoma anomalum, Dionda nubila, Notropis boops, Notropis cornutus chrysocephalus, Notropis telescopus,and Notropis zonatus.

Using LASSO to estimate marker effects for Genomic Selection,"Here we suggest a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach to estimate the marker effects for genomic selection using the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm, modified to include a crossâ€“validation step to define the best subset of markers to involve in the model. The LASSO-LARS was tested on simulated data which consisted of 5,865 individuals and 6,000 SNPs. The last generations of this dataset were the selection candidates. Using only animals from generations prior to the candidates, three approaches to splitting the population into training and validation sets for cross-validation were evaluated. Furthermore, different sizes of the validation sample were tested. Moreover, BLUP and Bayesian methods were carried out for comparison. The most reliable cross-validation method was the random splitting of overall population with a validation sample size of 50% of the reference population. The accuracy of the GEBVs (correlation with true breeding values) in the candidate population obtained by LASSO-LARS was 0.89 with 156 explanatory SNPs. This value was higher then those obtained by using BLUP and Bayesian methods, which were 0.75 and 0.84 respectively. It was concluded that LASSO-LARS approach is a good alternative way to estimate markers effects for genomic selection.",2009,Italian Journal of Animal Science
Cranial Discrete Traits in a Byzantine Population and Eastern Mediterranean Population Movements,"Abstract Since the beginning of the Holocene, the Anatolian region has been a crossroads for populations and civilizations from Europe, Asia, and the Near to Middle East, with increasing interactions since the Bronze Age. In this context, we examine cranial discrete traits from a Byzantine population from southwest Turkey, excavated at the archeological site of Sagalassos; the site displays human occupation since the 12th millennium B.P. To investigate the biological history of this population, we analyzed the frequency distribution of 17 cranial discrete traits from Sagalassos and 27 Eurasian and African populations. Ward's clustering procedure and multidimensional scaling analyses of the standardized mean measure of divergence (MMDst), based on trait frequencies, were used to represent the biological affinity between populations. Our results, considered within a large interpretive framework that takes into account the idea that populations are dynamic entities affected by various influences through time and space, revealed different strata of the Sagalassos biological history. Indeed, beyond an expected biological affinity of the Sagalassos population with eastern Mediterranean populations, we also detected affinities with sub-Saharan and northern and central European populations. We hypothesize that these affinity patterns in the Sagalassos biological package are the traces of the major migratory events that affected southwest Anatolia over the last millennia, as suggested from biological, archeological, and historical data.",2008,
Analysis of oil used in late Roman oil lamps with different mass spectrometric techniques revealed the presence of predominantly olive oil together with traces of animal fat.,"The lipid fraction of residues in ancient oil lamps found at the archaeological site of Sagalassos (south-west Turkey) was analysed by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). The identification of plant sterols and long chain alcohols suggested that a vegetable oil was used in these lamps. The lipid sample was also analysed with reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to MS with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). The identification of TAG's detected with LC-APCI-MS showed that predominantly olive oil was used as a fuel for the antique oil lamps. The presence of large quantities of multiply unsaturated triacylglycerol (TAG) and traces of saturated TAG indicated that also other oils and animal fat were added. Summarizing, the analysis of TAG's with LC-APCI-MS in lipid extracts of ancient ceramics proved to be a valuable method to reconstitute the original contents.",2001,Journal of chromatography. A

A SIPSS-Lasso-BPNN scheme for online voltage stability assessment,"Load active power at the voltage collapse point (PLL) is a useful index for online voltage stability assessment. This paper proposes a SIPSS-Lasso-BPNN scheme to offline fitting and online forecasting the load active power at the voltage collapse point PLL. The scheme consists of a SIPSS (Similarity Index of Power System State) based screening method, a Lasso (Least absolute shrinkage and select operator) method and a back propagation neural network (BPNN). The SIPSS based screening method screens the training samples according to their similarity indexes of power system states. The Lasso method selects the principal input features which are most explanatory to PLL via the shrunken regression analysis. The training samples are reduced by the above two methods. The BPNN is used to offline fit and online forecast the PLL through the reduced training samples. The test results on the New England 39 bus system shows that the SIPSS-Lasso-BPNN scheme can significantly improve the efficiency of BPNN offline training and guarantee the forecasting accuracy.",2014,2014 IEEE PES General Meeting | Conference & Exposition
Romanticism and Speculative Realism,"My essay surveys two recent philosophical strains of thoughts, Speculative Realism and Object-Oriented Ontology, in order to show their relevance to Romantic literature and culture, and the humanities more widely. I explain how Quentin Meillassoux, in his book After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency, targets â€œcorrelationism,â€ the notion that there is no access to the world except by the human mind, as the defining problem of modern thought. Romanticist Timothy Morton, springboarding from Graham Harman's Meillassoux-inspired Object-Oriented Ontology, theorizes what he calls a â€œhyperobject,â€ a non-localized object like climate change that disturbs and disrupts the supposed connection between human being and worldly phenomenon. These theories, I show, intersect with Romantic apocalyptic traditions that foresee a future paradise brought on by human action. As I read it, though, Meillassoux's Speculative Realism and Morton's hyperobjects shine a light on the largely ignored, post-apocalyptic aspects of Romantic literature in works like Shelley's â€œMont Blanc.â€ I argue that Romantic post-apocalypticism relies on Romantic irony to root us in a temporality of the present rather than a deferred vision of a utopian future.",2015,Literature Compass
What is in the news on a subject : automatic and sparse summarization of large document corpora,"News media play a significant role in our political and daily lives. The traditional approach in media analysis to news summarization is labor intensive. As the amount of news data grows rapidly, the need is acute for automatic and scalable methods to aid media analysis researchers so that they could screen corpora of news articles very quickly before detailed reading. In this paper we propose a general framework for subject-specific summarization of document corpora with news articles as a special case. We use the state-of-the art scalable and sparse statistical predictive framework to generate a list of short words/phrases as a summary of a subject. In particular, for a particular subject of interest (e.g., China), we first create a list of words/phrases to represent this subject (e.g., China, Chinas, and Chinese) and then create automatic labels for each document depending on the appearance pattern of this list in the document. The predictor vector is then high dimensional and contains counts of the rest of the words/phrases in the documents excluding phrases overlapping the subject list. Moreover, we consider several preprocessing schemes, including document unit choice, labeling scheme, tf-idf representation and L2 normalization, to prepare the text data before applying the sparse predictive framework. We examined four different scalable feature selection methods for summary list generation: phrase Co-occurrence, phrase correlation, L1-regularized logistic regression (L1LR), and L1-regularized linear regression (Lasso). We carefully designed and conducted a human survey to compare the different summarizers with human understanding based on news * Miratrix and Jia are co-first authors.",2011,
Composition and fine structural features of longitudinal veins in leaves of Thalassodendron ciliatum,"Longitudinal veins in leaf blades of the sea-grass Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forssk.) Den Hartog consist of a sheath of cells with thickened walls which encloses xylem, phloem and vascular parenchyma cells. While the xylem is reduced, phloem is well developed and consists of sieve tubes and companion cells. Two types of sieve tubes are distinguishable: those with thick walls and those with thin walls. Companion cells generally have dense cytoplasmic contents and are connected to sieve tubes by branched plasmodesmata. Vascular parenchyma cells possess an organelle-rich cytoplasm with chloroplasts as plastids. Numerous plasmodesmata interconnect contiguous vascular parenchyma cells. Plasmodesmata connecting vascular parenchyma cells to sieve tubes and companion cells are observed less frequently. Each bundle sheath cell is encased within a multilayered suberin lamella. Bundle sheath cell walls have prominent pit fields which are traversed by plasmodesmata. The plasmodesmata perforate the suberin lamella and interconnect sheath cells with contiguous vascular parenchyma and mesophyll cells. Bundle sheath cells generally possess sparse cytoplasmic contents but have relatively well developed chloroplasts. The suberin lamella appears to form an apoplastic barrier between mesophyll and vascular tissues. Structural features of the veins are compared with those found in similar veins in leaves of terrestrial monocotyledonous plants.",1983,South African Journal of Botany
Big data analytics: integrating penalty strategies,"We present efficient estimation and prediction strategies for the classical multiple regression model when the dimensions of the parameters are larger than the number of observations. These strategies are motivated by penalty estimation and Stein-type estimation procedures. More specifically, we consider the estimation of regression parameters in sparse linear models when some of the predictors may have a very weak influence on the response of interest. In a high-dimensional situation, a number of existing variable selection techniques exists. However, they yield different subset models and may have different numbers of predictors. Generally speaking, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) approach produces an over-fitted model compared with its competitors, namely the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) method and adaptive Lasso (aLasso). Thus, prediction based only on a submodel selected by such methods will be subject to selection bias.

"Guidance for decisions using the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package in stock, ecosystem, habitat and climate assessments","Abstract Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a â€œcommon currencyâ€ for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and â€œdesign principlesâ€ for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves â€œspecies ordinationâ€ of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a â€œcommon currencyâ€ approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.",2019,Fisheries Research
16S metagenomic analysis reveals adaptability of a mixed-PAH-degrading consortium isolated from crude oil-contaminated seawater to changing environmental conditions.,"A bacterial consortium, named SWO, was enriched from crude oil-contaminated seawater from Phrao Bay in Rayong Province, Thailand, after a large oil spill in 2013. The bacterial consortium degraded a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) mixture consisting of phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene (50â€¯mg L-1 each) by approximately 73%, 69%, 52%, and 48%, respectively, within 21 days. This consortium exhibited excellent adaptation to a wide range of environmental conditions. It could degrade a mixture of four PAHs under a range of pH values (4.0-9.0), temperatures (25â€¯Â°C-37â€¯Â°C), and salinities (0-10â€¯g L-1 with NaCl). In addition, this consortium degraded 20-30% of benzo[a]pyrene and perylene (10â€¯mg L-1 each), high molecular weight PAHs, in the presence of other PAHs within 35 days, and degraded 40% of 2% (v/v) crude oil within 20 days. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis demonstrated that Pseudomonas and Methylophaga were the dominant genera of consortium SWO in almost all treatments, while Pseudidiomarina, Thalassospira and Alcanivorax were predominant under higher salt concentrations. Moreover, Pseudomonas and Alcanivorax were dominant in the crude oil-degradation treatment. Our results suggest that the consortium SWO maintained its biodegradation ability by altering the bacterial community profile upon encountering changes in the environmental conditions.",2018,Journal of hazardous materials
Slope-adaptive Variable Selection via Convex Optimization.,"We introduce a new estimator for the vector of coefficients Î² in the linear model y = XÎ² + z, where X has dimensions n Ã— p with p possibly larger than n. SLOPE, short for Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation, is the solution to [Formula: see text]where Î»1 â‰¥ Î»2 â‰¥ â€¦ â‰¥ Î» p â‰¥ 0 and [Formula: see text] are the decreasing absolute values of the entries of b. This is a convex program and we demonstrate a solution algorithm whose computational complexity is roughly comparable to that of classical â„“1 procedures such as the Lasso. Here, the regularizer is a sorted â„“1 norm, which penalizes the regression coefficients according to their rank: the higher the rank-that is, stronger the signal-the larger the penalty. This is similar to the Benjamini and Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B57 (1995) 289-300] procedure (BH) which compares more significant p-values with more stringent thresholds. One notable choice of the sequence {Î» i } is given by the BH critical values [Formula: see text], where q âˆˆ (0, 1) and z(Î±) is the quantile of a standard normal distribution. SLOPE aims to provide finite sample guarantees on the selected model; of special interest is the false discovery rate (FDR), defined as the expected proportion of irrelevant regressors among all selected predictors. Under orthogonal designs, SLOPE with Î»BH provably controls FDR at level q. Moreover, it also appears to have appreciable inferential properties under more general designs X while having substantial power, as demonstrated in a series of experiments running on both simulated and real data.",2015,The annals of applied statistics

Once a model is formulated, its parameters can be estimated by optimization. Because model parsimony is important, models routinely include nondifferentiable penalty terms such as the lasso. This sober reality complicates minimization and maximization. Our broad survey stresses a few important principles in algorithm design. Rather than view these principles in isolation, it is more productive to mix and match them. A few well chosen examples illustrate this point. Algorithm derivation is also emphasized, and theory is downplayed, particularly the abstractions of the convex calculus. Thus, our survey should be useful and accessible to a broad audience.",2014,International statistical review = Revue internationale de statistique
"SEABIRDS FOUND DEAD ON NEW ZEALAND BEACHES IN 1991, AND A REVIEW OF Moms AND Sula SPECIES RECOVERIES, 1943 TO 1991","In 1991, 4780 km of coast of New Zealand were patrolled and 6955 dead seabirds were found as pan of the Beach Patrol Scheme. An unusual find was a Red-tailed Tropicbird (Phaethon mbricauda), and more than usual were found of the Antarctic Petrel (Thalassoica antarctica), White-headed Petrel (Pterodroma lessoniz), Little Black Shag (Phalacrocorax sulcirosnis) and Brown Skua (Catharacta skua Ionnberp). A summary is given of the coastal and monthly distributions of Moms and Sula species found during the 1943-1991 period. Overall, 5637 Australasian Gannets (Moms serrator) were found, mainly on beaches of the northern half of the Nonh Island. The peak period of adult recoveries was in December-February, but that of juveniles was in February-May. Both the Brown Booby (Sula leucogaster) and the Masked Booby (Sula dactylatra) are vagrants to the New Zealand mainland, with four and one individuals respectively having been found by patrollers.",1993,

Most companies share information such as products, Services, partnerships, and research and development activities on their website. All this information is much analytical opportunities provided that we can retrieve and interpret. In this context, is the content of a website can be enough to conduct a study on innovation and commercialization? Websites are sources of information available and accessible to everyone. The majority of companies with a website, the coverage of an Internet-based study is an advantage. For our research on the commercialization of nanotechnology in Canada, we recover as many data on websites of Canadian companies listed by various sources as having activities in nanotechnology. From these data we cluster companies according to their nanotechnology field using a list of keywords from scientific papers to estimate the level of advancement of Canadian companies in nanotechnology research. 
Finally thanks to several indicators of innovation and marketing we describe the current state of nanotechnology in the Canadian industry.",2015,
Proteolysis of the Native Murine IL 1Î² Precursor is Required to Generate IL 1Î² Bioactivity,"Abstract We utilized antisera specific for murine IL 1Î± and IL 1Î² proteins to characterize cellassociated IL 1 according to two distinct criteria, immunochemical detection of radiolabeled IL 1 polypeptides and inhibition of IL 1 activity in celllysates. Evidence is presented that IL 1a and IL 1Î² are each synthesized by LPS-stimulated but not by unstimulated murine macrophages and accumulate within the cell as intracellular precursors in sizes of 33 kDa and 37 kDa, respectively. As judged by the respective rates of synthesis, IL 1Î± was about 4-fold more abundant than IL 1Î². Most (â‰ª 95%) of the cell-associated IL 1 activity was inhibited in the presence of the antiserum to IL 1Î±, suggesting that the precursor of IL 1Î² is mostly biologically inactive. Incubation of cell lysates with papain but not with trypsin or plasmin markedly stimulates an increase in the level of cell-associated IL 1Î² activity and leads to the cleavage of 15-16 kDa carboxyl-terminal fragments from the IL 1Î² precursor. Together, these data indicate that proteolysis of the IL 1Î² precursor is required to generate bioactive IL 1Î² molecules and provide a basis for further investigations of the specific role of proteinases in processing the IL 1Î² precursor to a bioactive form.",1989,Immunobiology
Nearest shrunken centroids via alternative genewise shrinkages,"Nearest shrunken centroids (NSC) is a popular classification method for microarray data. NSC calculates centroids for each class and ""shrinks"" the centroids toward 0 using soft thresholding. Future observations are then assigned to the class with the minimum distance between the observation and the (shrunken) centroid. Under certain conditions the soft shrinkage used by NSC is equivalent to a LASSO penalty. However, this penalty can produce biased estimates when the true coefficients are large. In addition, NSC ignores the fact that multiple measures of the same gene are likely to be related to one another. We consider several alternative genewise shrinkage methods to address the aforementioned shortcomings of NSC. Three alternative penalties were considered: the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), the adaptive LASSO (ADA), and the minimax concave penalty (MCP). We also showed that NSC can be performed in a genewise manner. Classification methods were derived for each alternative shrinkage method or alternative genewise penalty, and the performance of each new classification method was compared with that of conventional NSC on several simulated and real microarray data sets. Moreover, we applied the geometric mean approach for the alternative penalty functions. In general the alternative (genewise) penalties required fewer genes than NSC. The geometric mean of the class-specific prediction accuracies was improved, as well as the overall predictive accuracy in some cases. These results indicate that these alternative penalties should be considered when using NSC.",2017,PLoS ONE
Navajo Settlement and Architecture in Southeastern California,"HE Navajo have probably been the subÂ­ ject of as much ethnological study as any Native ,A.iiiericaii group. Their capacity for assimilating both material and ideological culture traits from surrounding groups is well documented (Hester 19(^2; Witherspoon 1983: 5331 and. as discussed by Aberle (1963) and Witherspoon (1975), may stem from a traditionally tlexible lifestyle. This fiexibility is evidenced socioecononiically by Navajo participation in railroad construction and inaintenance from Chicago westward to California, including the Moja\e Desert, and archaeologically by the establishment of railassociated occupation sites (Kluckhohn, Hill, and Kluckhohn 1971: 320), This article deÂ­ scribes several Navajo structures in the Mojave",1985,Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology
Designs and optical tests of thermal links for an optical refrigerator,"Dielectric mirror leakage at large angles of incidence limits the effectiveness of solid state optical refrigerators due to reheating caused by photon absorption in an attached load. In this paper, we present several thermally conductive link solutions to greatly reduce the net photon absorption. The Los Alamos Solid State Optical Refrigerator (LASSOR) has demonstrated cooling of a Yb3+ doped ZBLANP glass to 208 K. We have designed optically isolating thermal link geometries capable of extending cooling to a typical heat load with minimal absorptive reheating, and we have tested the optical performance of these designs. A surrogate source operating at 625 nm was used to mimic the angular distribution of light from the LASSOR cooling element. While total link performance is dependent on additional factors, we have found that the best thermal link reduced the net transmission of photons to 0.04%, which includes the trapping mirrors 8.1% transmission. Our measurements of the optical performance of the various link geometries are supported by computer simulations of the designs using Code V, a commercially available optical modeling software package.",2008,
The Ridge Iterative Regression and the Data-Augmentation Lasso,"We propose the ridge iterative regression (RIR) and the data-augmentation lasso (DAL) to improve the ridge regression and the lasso respectively. We prove that by updating the coefficient itself, the solution of the RIR converges to that of the ordinary least squares when the design matrix \(\varvec{X}\) has full column rank. The simulations and real-world data demonstrate that the DAL often outperforms the lasso in sparsity and estimation accuracy for the coefficient and attains smaller prediction error.",2019,
Evidence-Based Assessment from Simple Clinical Judgments to Statistical Learning: Evaluating a Range of Options Using Pediatric Bipolar Disorder as a Diagnostic Challenge.,"Reliability of clinical diagnoses is often low. There are many algorithms that could improve diagnostic accuracy, and statistical learning is becoming popular. Using pediatric bipolar disorder as a clinically challenging example, we evaluated a series of increasingly complex models ranging from simple screening to a supervised LASSO regression in a large (N=550) academic clinic sample. We then externally validated models in a community clinic (N=511) with the same candidate predictors and semi-structured interview diagnoses, providing high methodological consistency; the clinics also had substantially different demography and referral patterns. Models performed well according to internal validation metrics. Complex models degraded rapidly when externally validated. NaÃ¯ve Bayesian and logistic models concentrating on predictors identified in prior meta-analyses tied or bettered LASSO models when externally validated. Implementing these methods would improve clinical diagnostic performance. Statistical learning research should continue to invest in high quality indicators and diagnoses to supervise model training.",2018,Clinical psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science
Comparing Penalized Regression Analysis of Logistic Regression Model with Multicollinearity,"The goal of this research is to estimate the parameter of the logistic regression model by penalized regression analysis which consisted of ridge regression, lasso, and elastic net method. The logistic regression is considered between a binary dependent variable and 3 and 5 independent variables. The independent variables are generated from normal distribution, contaminated normal distribution, and t distribution on correlation coefficient at 0.1, 0.5, and 0.99 or called multicollinearity problem. The maximum likelihood estimator has used as the classical method by differential the log likelihood function with respect to the coefficients. Ridge regression is to choose the unknown ridge parameter by cross-validation, so ridge estimator is evaluated by the adding ridge parameter on penalty term. Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) is added the penalty term on scales sum of the absolute value of the coefficients. The elastic net can be mixed between ridge regression and lasso on the penalty term. The criterion of these methods is compared by percentage of predicted accuracy value. The results are found that lasso is satisfied when the independent variables are simulated from normal and t distribution in most cases, and the lasso outperforms on the contaminated normal distribution.",2019,
Clarithromycin Transport by Gingival Fibroblasts and,"Macrolide antibiotics penetrate cells, but the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. The objective of this study was to characterize the mechanisms of clarithromycin uptake by gingival fibroblasts and oral epithelium. Cultured human gingival fibroblasts and SCC-25 cells were incubated with [ 3 H]-clarithromycin. We assayed clarithromycin transport by measuring cellassociated radioactivity over time. Fibroblasts and epithelial cells rapidly accumulated clarithro mycin, attaining steady-state intracellular concentrations within 15 minutes. Incubation in medium containing 2 g/mL clarithromycin yielded steady-state intracellular concentrations of 75.8 g/mL in fibroblasts and 6.6 g/mL in SCC25 cells. Clarithromycin transport exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics and was inhibited below 37Â°C. The Michaelis constants for fibro blasts and SCC-25 cells were 78.4 and 227 g/mL, respectively, while the maximum transport velocities were 264 and 381 ng/min/10 6 cells, respectively. Thus, both types of cells take up clarithromyci n via a concentrative active transport system. By increasing intracellular clarithromycin levels, this system may enhance the effectiveness of clarithromyci n against invasive periodontal pathogens.",2016,
