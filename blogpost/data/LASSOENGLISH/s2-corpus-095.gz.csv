"Structure of microcin J25, a peptide inhibitor of bacterial RNA polymerase, is a lassoed tail.","Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is a 21-amino acid peptide inhibitor active against the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of Gram negative bacteria. Previously, the structure of MccJ25 was reported to be a head-to-tail circle, cyclo(-G(1)GAGHVPEYF(10)VGIGTPISFY(20)G-). On the basis of biochemical studies, mass spectrometry, and NMR, we show that this structure is incorrect, and that the peptide has an extraordinary structural fold. MccJ25 contains an internal lactam linkage between the alpha-amino group of Gly1 and the gamma-carboxyl of Glu8. The tail (Tyr9-Gly21) passes through the ring (Gly1-Glu8), with Phe19 and Tyr20 straddling each side of the ring, sterically trapping the tail in a noncovalent interaction we call a lassoed tail.",2003,Journal of the American Chemical Society
Photoelectron Spectra of Some Bromoethylenes and 2-Bromopropene,"The photoelectron spectra of vinyl bromide, cis- and trans-1,2-dibromoethylene and 2-bromopropene have been obtained. Interaction of the bromine ""lone pair"" electrons with those in the C=C Ï€ bond is discussed. The assignments are considered in relation to the chloroethylenes. The spectra provide experimental evidence for a proposal by Klasson and Manne that previous studies have reported too many I.P.'s for some of the chloroethylenes.",1972,Canadian Journal of Chemistry
Object Definition for Aboveground Biomass and Leaf Area Index Estimation,"Objects perform better than pixels when estimating aboveground biomass and Leaf Area Index (LAI) from hyperspectral data. An essential question though, is how to define the objects. With per-pixel classification all observation units are square pixels of fixed dimensions. With objectoriented the observation units (objects) are groups of contiguous pixels. The objects can be defined either by stratification, i.e. based on an external variable (e.g. soil type), or by segmentation, i.e. based on spectral similarity. In the latter case, the maximal spectral heterogeneity defined by the user, determines the size and shape of the resulting objects. It is therefore crucial to find the optimal heterogeneity. Furthermore, the bands included in the segmentation process will have a significant effect as well. This paper aims at finding the band combination that results in optimal predictions. Optimal being defined as lowest prediction errors. A field campaign was hold to collect biomass and LAI data for over 200 plots in the Peyne catchment in southern France. These data were linked to a HyMap image. The optimal band combination will be found with Lasso regression, which is a shrinkage method. These methods put constraints not only on the prediction error, but also on the size of the regression coefficients. Particularly with intercorrelated variables this is a valuable addition since it prohibits extreme coefficient values as one obtains with regular multiple regression. Lasso regression is a special type of shrinkage method since the coefficients of less significant variables are put to zero, so band selection is performed during the analysis. The bands that are found to be significant can be used in the image segmentation, for which band selection is a prerequisite, since no selection takes place during the process. Results indicate that different object sizes do influence prediction accuracy, that those sizes are different for aboveground biomass and LAI and that the bands used in prediction are different as well.",2007,
PET/CT radiomics in breast cancer: promising tool for prediction of pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy,"PurposeTo assess the role of radiomics parameters in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.MethodsSeventy-nine patients who had undergone pretreatment staging 18F-FDG PET/CT and treatment with NAC between January 2010 and January 2018 were included in the study. Primary lesions on PET images were delineated, and extraction of first-, second-, and higher-order imaging features was performed using LIFEx software. The relationship between these parameters and pCR to NAC was analyzed by multiple logistic regression models.ResultsNineteen patients (24%) had pCR to NAC. Different models were generated on complete information and imputed datasets, using univariable and multivariable logistic regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression. All models could predict pCR to NAC, with area under the curve values ranging from 0.70 to 0.73. All models agreed that tumor molecular subtype is the primary predictor of the primary endpoint.ConclusionsOur models predicted that patients with subtype 2 and subtype 3 (HER2+ and triple negative, respectively) are more likely to have a pCR to NAC than those with subtype 1 (luminal). The association between PET imaging features and pCR suggested that PET imaging features could be considered as potential predictors of pCR in locally advanced breast cancer patients.",2019,European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging
The joint consequences of multiple components of statistical sampling designs,"Provided are astexin-1, astexin-2 and astexin-3 lasso peptides, which are based on sequences identified in Asticaccaulis excentricus, and methods of making and using same. Astexin-1 is highly polar, in contrast to many lasso peptides that are primarily hydrophobic, and has modest antimicrobial activity against Caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium related to Asticaccaulis excentricus. The solution structure of astexin-1 was determined, revealing a unique topology that is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between segments of the peptide. Astexins-2 and -3 are intracellular lasso peptides.",2002,Marine Ecology Progress Series
Civilization of Bronze Age Crete,"Usually, our knowledge of history, society, and culture is based on the written sources. However, the Minoan texts are extremely few.Â Thus, the Minoan art appears to be almost the only source of our knowledge of the Minoan civilization and culture. This paper attempts toÂ analyze the phenomenon of the Minoan art of Bronze Age Crete. Discovered by A. Evans, the Minoan civilization â€” an Aegean Bronze AgeÂ civilization â€” ï¬‚ourished on the island of Crete and some other AegeanÂ islands, in particular on Thera/Santorini with its settlement of Akrotiri. For quite a long time, the Minoan civilization had been labeled as peacefulÂ making reference to Minoan Thalassocracy, â€œPax Minoicaâ€, and a ratherÂ small number of fortiï¬cations. The lack of written information has givenÂ vent to researchersâ€™ fantasy and the idea of the Minoan culture as the Golden Age of humanity was not accidental: the Minoan artists portrayed lifeÂ as a continuous ï¬‚ow of beauty, an endless game, in which ï¬‚eeting emotionsÂ and joy become the spring of happiness. Later, the conception of peacefulÂ Minoans was re-evaluated. Evansâ€™s reconstructions were subjected to serious criticism from the standpoint of contemporary archeology. However,Â we can â€œthrow out the baby with the bath waterâ€. We do not have toÂ accept everything Evans stated about the Minoans, but we should be grateful for his profound inquiry into the unknown world of the human past.Â The Minoan art is important for contemporary humans because it drawsÂ attention to a harmonious life in the world of here and now; it carries anÂ incredible power of inspiration and beauty; it brings a feeling of lightness,Â joy and a happy ï¬‚ight of a soul into our lives. And that really matters.",2019,
The Role of Education on Behavioural Changes to Modifiable Risks Factors after Myocardial Infarction,"Documentation is the written and legal recording of the interventions that concern the patient and it includes a sequence of processes. Documentation is established with the personal record of the patient, which constitutes a base of information on the situation of his health. The importance of nursing documentation is neuralgic, provided that without it, there cannot be a complete qualitative nursing intervention and not even an effective care for the patient. In the purposes of nursing documentation are included the research on a more effective care of the already detected problems, the programming of care through the organization and modification of the plan on patientâ€™s care and the more direct communication between the professionals of the health system, who collaborate on the patientâ€™s care. The methods of documentation are multiple and among the most basic ones are the method directed towards the source or the problem, the system problem-intervention-evaluation, the focused registration, the focusing diagram, the registration by exception, the electronic files and the home documentation.

Detection Estimation and Grid matching of Multiple Targets with Single Snapshot Measurements,"In this work, we explore the problems of detecting the number of narrow-band, far-field targets and estimating their corresponding directions from single snapshot measurements. The principles of sparse signal recovery (SSR) are used for the single snapshot detection and estimation of multiple targets. In the SSR framework, the DoA estimation problem is grid based and can be posed as the lasso optimization problem. However, the SSR framework for DoA estimation gives rise to the grid mismatch problem, when the unknown targets (sources) are not matched with the estimation grid chosen for the construction of the array steering matrix at the receiver. The block sparse recovery framework is known to mitigate the grid mismatch problem by jointly estimating the targets and their corresponding offsets from the estimation grid using the group lasso estimator. The corresponding detection problem reduces to estimating the optimal regularization parameter ($\tau$) of the lasso (in case of perfect grid-matching) or group-lasso estimation problem for achieving the required probability of correct detection ($P_c$). We propose asymptotic and finite sample test statistics for detecting the number of sources with the required $P_c$ at moderate to high signal to noise ratios. Once the number of sources are detected, or equivalently the optimal $\hat{\tau}$ is estimated, the corresponding estimation and grid matching of the DoAs can be performed by solving the lasso or group-lasso problem at $\hat{\tau}$",2019,ArXiv
"Thalassobacter stenotrophicus Macian et al. 2005 is a later synonym of Jannaschia cystaugens Adachi et al. 2004, with emended description of the genus Thalassobacter.","The type strains of Jannaschia cystaugens (LMG 22015(T)) and Thalassobacter stenotrophicus (CECT 5294(T)) were analysed by means of genomic DNA-DNA hybridization, comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences and phenotypic properties determined under the same methodological conditions. J. cystaugens LMG 22015(T) showed DNA-DNA relatedness levels of 72% when hybridized with the genomic DNA of T. stenotrophicus CECT 5294(T). Sequence comparisons revealed that the 16S rRNA genes of the two strains had a similarity of 99.8%. The cellular fatty acid and polar lipid compositions of the two strains and their DNA mol% G+C contents were almost identical. Bacteriochlorophyll a (Bchl a) and polyhydroxybutyrate were produced by both strains under the same culture conditions. Their closest phylogenetic neighbours were Jannaschia helgolandensis and Jannaschia rubra; however, the low sequence similarity values (95.7-95.9%) and several important differences in phenotypic traits (ionic requirements, Bchl a production and polar lipids) support the distinction between the genera Thalassobacter and Jannaschia. Thus, we propose the unification of J. cystaugens (LMG 22015(T)) and T. stenotrophicus (CECT 5294(T)) as Thalassobacter stenotrophicus (type strain, CECT 5294(T)=DSM 16310(T)).

The T2L2 ground experiment time transfer in the picosecond range over a few kilometres,"The new generation of optical time transfer (T2L2: Time Transfer by Laser Link [1]), under development at CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) and OCA (Observatoire de la CoÌ‚te d'Azur), shall allow the synchronisation of remote ultra-stable clocks and the determination of their performances over intercontinental distances. The principle is based on the propagation of light pulses between clocks to be synchronized. T2L2 is the follow-on mission to LASSO (LAser Synchronisation from Stationary Orbit) [2, 3] with performances in the picosecond range for both stability and accuracy. T2L2 is based on a space instrumentation that includes an event timer linked to the space clock, and some laser ranging stations linked to ground clocks. In order to validate the concept and to evaluate precisely the error budget, we realized two global experiments with some prototypes of both the ground and space instrumentations. These prototypes are based on electronic event timers and photo-detection devices that we developed in the framework of T2L2 project. In 1998, we performed a first ground experiment involving two OCA's laser stations and a first prototype of the space instrumentation 2.5 km apart. Results were promising but with some limitations due to the use of a bad quartz oscillator as the space clock. A second experiment was decided in 2004 with the OCA Lunar laser ranging station and a more finalized space segment installed closed to the station. The experiment was based on a free space propagation across 10 kilometres thanks to a large corner cube placed 2.5 km away. In order to measure the noise of the link without the noise of the clocks, a third event timer was able to measure the direct phase between signal clocks of both the space and ground prototypes.",2006,Proceedings of the 20th European Frequency and Time Forum

"La RevoluciÃ³n De Mayo Y Los Intelectuales Del ""pensamiento Nacional""","We look into the various interpretations of the May Revolution that several intellectuals put forward in what we might describe roughly as the ""National Thinking"". Rodolfo Puiggros, Juan Jose Hernandez Arregui, Jorge Abelardo Ramos y Norberto Galasso have certain ideological perspectives built around popular nationalism, anti-imperialist Latinamericanism and socialist ideology. We discuss the common aspects of these authors, but the main emphasis is on the divergences between their interpretations, via a comparative study of their work. These intellectuals openly argue against the interpretation of May enshrined in the ""Official History"", questioning its main pillars. But despite the fact that they all begin from historical materialism and share a political identity (""social nationalism""), the conclusions they reach point not only to divergent perspectives but also to work done in the heat of different historical moments, and are inseparably tied to the political discourse of their time and clearly associated with the national project that they aspire to contributing to build. We shall also attempt to throw some light on these aspects. Today, within the framework of the Bicentenaries and the numerous forums and activities that seek to take a new look at our 200 years of history, we should not neglect these enriching discussions but, rather, bring them into the debate together with new research in an essential task.",2011,Revista Pilquen: SecciÃ³n Ciencias Sociales

Efficient Generalized Fused Lasso and Its Applications,"Generalized fused lasso (GFL) penalizes variables with l1 norms based both on the variables and their pairwise differences. GFL is useful when applied to data where prior information is expressed using a graph over the variables. However, the existing GFL algorithms incur high computational costs and do not scale to high-dimensional problems. In this study, we propose a fast and scalable algorithm for GFL. Based on the fact that fusion penalty is the LovÃ¡sz extension of a cut function, we show that the key building block of the optimization is equivalent to recursively solving graph-cut problems. Thus, we use a parametric flow algorithm to solve GFL in an efficient manner. Runtime comparisons demonstrate a significant speedup compared to existing GFL algorithms. Moreover, the proposed optimization framework is very general; by designing different cut functions, we also discuss the extension of GFL to directed graphs. Exploiting the scalability of the proposed algorithm, we demonstrate the applications of our algorithm to the diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and video background subtraction (BS). In the AD problem, we formulated the diagnosis of AD as a GFL regularized classification. Our experimental evaluations demonstrated that the diagnosis performance was promising. We observed that the selected critical voxels were well structured, i.e., connected, consistent according to cross validation, and in agreement with prior pathological knowledge. In the BS problem, GFL naturally models arbitrary foregrounds without predefined grouping of the pixels. Even by applying simple background models, e.g., a sparse linear combination of former frames, we achieved state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets.",2016,ACM TIST
"Seasonal and spatial dynamics of a ciliate assemblage in a warm-monomictic Lake Alchichica (Puebla, Mexico)","The distribution of the ciliate assemblage was surveyed along a depth gradient in the maar crater, athalassohaline, warm monomictic Lake Alchichica (Puebla, Mexico) from June 2003 to October 2006 (monthly).

Maurice Ravel: ""Arriere de Le Feu"" (L'Enfant et les sortileges). Leonard Bernstein: ""Glitter and be Gay"" (Candide). Count yourself fortunate if you have seen Natalie Dessay on the opera stage. There is probably no singer today or even within recent memory, aside from Teresa Stratas, who can compare to her when it comes to sheer theatrical intensity and range. Nothing could confirm that as convincingly as this video documentary which showcases the French coloratura soprano in an array of staged excerpts from some of her finest roles. Fans of Dessay will enjoy every vibrant moment of this disk, while viewers who favor safer predictability may find this to be an enlightening, if occasionally bewildering demonstration of operatic performance at its most vivid and daring. Dessay first burst into prominence in 1990, when she won a major voice competition in Vienna that led directly to a prestigious concert engagement at La Scala. What has ensued is a career that has taken the soprano to the pinnacle of her profession with glittering triumphs with most of the major opera companies of the world. Regrettably, her career also has included an unhappy hiatus of nearly two years when she developed vocal fold nodules that ultimately required surgery. Fortunately, her recovery from that setback seems to be complete and she is singing as fearlessly and impressively as ever. Dessay's voice is not particularly large nor imposing, but it has an arresting color and purity which enhances its impact even in large houses. What is more notable about her singing is her superlative musicality as well as her potent communicativeness, made possible in part by a solid-if somewhat unorthodox-vocal technique that serves her well. Dessay is a particularly unique and consummate artist in that her considerable skills as a singer and musician are combined with exceptional skills as an actress. Her first work onstage was actually in spoken theater rather than opera, and it is an artistic arena to which she hopes to return someday. In the meantime, she has combined her theatrical training and talent with her musical exploits in spectacular and uncompromising fashion. This collection showcases Dessay in staged performances spanning a decade (1993-2003) of her professional career, in seven different operatic roles plus a vocal arrangement of Johann Strauss's ""Fruhlingsstimmen Valse,"" which she sang for the party scene in a New Year's Eve Vienna State Opera performance of Die Fledermaus. That performance, one of the earliest on the disk, features astounding singing, including a lovely high A flat above high C, plus a sustained high F in the last cadence that must be heard to be believed. But far more significant than the high notes is Dessay's fleet-footed grace with even the most intricate fioritura and her uncanny ability to make these pyrotechnics sound musical and expressive. It is a telling way to open a collection that clearly has been put together as a celebration of Dessay's abilities as a singing actress. Here she is not portraying any particular character at all, but simply singing, and yet her performance enraptures us just as completely as do any of the performances that follow. It serves as a healthy reminder to the viewer that Dessay, for as incredible an actress as she might be, is also a singer of the first rank who belongs with legends like Sutherland and Sills. â€¦",2008,Journal of Singing
Self-paced Mixture of Regressions,"Mixture of regressions (MoR) is the wellestablished and effective approach to model discontinuous and heterogeneous data in regression problems. Existing MoR approaches assume smooth joint distribution for its good anlaytic properties. However, such assumption makes existing MoR very sensitive to intra-component outliers (the noisy training data residing in certain components) and the inter-component imbalance (the different amounts of training data in different components). In this paper, we make the earliest effort on Self-paced Learning (SPL) in MoR, i.e., Self-paced mixture of regressions (SPMoR) model. We propose a novel selfpaced regularizer based on the Exclusive LASSO, which improves inter-component balance of training data. As a robust learning regime, SPL pursues confidence sample reasoning. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SPMoR, we conducted experiments on both the sythetic examples and real-world applications to age estimation and glucose estimation. The results show that SPMoR outperforms the stateof-the-arts methods.",2017,
Breeding biology of high-latitude Antarctic fulmarine petrels (Procellariidae),"This paper provides basic information about the breeding biology of four species of Antarctic fulmarine petrels breeding in the Rauer Islands, East Antarctica: Antarctic fulmar Fulmarus glacialoides, Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, Cape petrel Daption capense, and snow petrel Pagodroma nivea. Timing and duration of the nesting cycle, incubation and nestling periods, and timing of breeding were determined over three consecutive breeding cycles. Comparing these data with those of other populations revealed that the duration of breeding showed little interannual and spatial variation within the four species. The length of the breeding period varied between the species, with incubation period and nesting cycle length positively related to adult body mass. Nestling period length also differed between the species but was unrelated to adult body mass. Breeding period lengths for these fulmarine petrels were shorter than those for other procellarids and albatrosses. Compressed and invariant breeding cycles of Antarctic fulmarine petrels may have evolved in response to a short season which limits breeding and to opportunities presented by highly abundant food sources.",2002,Journal of Zoology
A simple pipeline for the assessment of legacy soil datasets: An example and test with soil organic carbon from a highly variable area,"Abstract Legacy databases provide unique information on soil properties and act as a guide for the setup of monitoring processes. However, their use requires an evaluation of their drawbacks, especially when aiming to model the soil traits by depth. We set up a procedure for the integration and error correction of a soil legacy database. This database consisted of 6994 records in its original form and 6674 records after correction. These records were collected from 2886 locations in the south of Italy on a 25,711-km2 island (Sicily, Italy). Samples were taken in arable lands (5471 records), orchards, vineyards and seminatural lands (3010 records), and woodland and natural areas (1203 records). The procedure for the integration and error highlighting improved the prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC), and a general linear model with covariate selection by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) tested the procedure. We focussed on exploring the amount of legacy information as georeferenced soil properties. SOC and fine earth fractions were analysed for each sample. Bulk density was provided for only 20% of the samples. These results will help to account for the legacy data available and propose an analysis to harmonize an SOC dataset; highlight missing or incorrect data; summarize data; and offer synthesis criteria for benchmarking SOC in different land uses and pedological areas. In addition, the results may stimulate funding bodies to support research in an open data frame, which can be turned into more sustainable use of resources, improved communication between governments and farmers, and the production of standard datasets that meet and facilitate the requirements for regional agro-environmental modelling.",2019,Catena

pro-oxidants in macrophage atherogenicity,"DOI:10.1097/MOL.0000000000000287 Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, which involves interactions among serum lipoproteins and arterial wall cells. Macrophages are the predominant cells during early atherogenesis as they accumulate cholesterol and are transformed to lipid-rich foam cells. Macrophage foam cell formation involves enhanced uptake of LDL or oxidized (Ox)-LDL, increased cholesterol biosynthesis, and/or attenuated HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages [1 && ]. Oxidative stress contributes to atherosclerosis development and recent reports have improved our understanding as to how endogenous or exogenous antioxidants or pro-oxidants regulate foam cell formation and thus either attenuate or accelerate atherosclerosis progression. In a thorough investigation comparing lipid metabolism and cellular oxidative stress in lipid metabolizing cells (macrophages, liver and intestinal cells), the selective biological features of these cells, as well as their modulation by antioxidants or pro-oxidants, have been recently described. Interestingly, the antioxidative properties of the HDLassociated paraoxonase1 (PON1) were shown to be macrophage specific, as PON1 did not decrease cellular oxidative stress in the other lipid-metabolizing cells [1 && ]. PON1 is a key endogenous lipolactonase antioxidant responsible for many of the HDLâ€™s antiatherogenic characteristics, including HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Furthermore, HDL (mostly, the HDL3 subfraction) stimulated PON1 antiatherogenic biological activities in a macrophage model system, as cholesterol efflux from macrophages was significantly increased both in vivo and in vitro by a combination of HDLÃ¾PON1 in comparison with HDL or PON1 alone [2]. Interestingly, the antiatherogenic effects of HDLÃ¾PON1 were increased by exogenous antioxidants including the dietary polyphenol quercetin and the hypocholesterolemic drug simvastatin [2]. In a clinical aspect, exogenous antioxidants such as the polyphenol (punicalagin)-rich pomegranate extract together with statins were shown to synergistically reduce oxidative stress and improve lipid status",2016,
Linking Genetics of Brain Changes to Alzheimer's Disease: Sparse Whole Genome Association Scan of Regional MRI Volumes in the ADNI and AddNeuroMed Cohorts.,"BACKGROUND
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly heritable disease, but until recently few replicated genetic markers have been identified. Markers identified so far are likely to account for only a tiny fraction of the heritability of AD and many more genetic risk alleles are thought to be undiscovered.


OBJECTIVE
Identifying genetic markers for AD using combined analysis of genetics and brain imaging data.


METHODS
Imaging quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) has recently emerged as an interesting research area for linking genetics of brain changes to AD. We consider a genome-wide association scan of 109 brain-wide regional imaging phenotypes to identify genetic susceptibility loci for AD from a combined set of 1,045 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the AddNeuroMed studies. We use one-SNP-at-a-time as well as multi-SNP Hyperlasso based iQTL methods for the analysis.


RESULTS
We identified several novel markers associated with AD, namely HOMER2 (rs1256429; intronic, p = 8.7 Ã— 10â»Â¹â°), EOMES (rs2724509; flanking), JAM2 (rs2829841; intronic), and WEE1 (rs10770042; coding). The SNP rs1256429 (HOMER2) was one of the top hits in Hyperlasso as well as in the single-SNP analysis showing an association with the volume of the right thalamus and AD, a brain region reported to be linked with AD in several studies.


CONCLUSION
We believe that the markers identified in this study are novel additions to the existing list of genetic variants associated with AD which can be validated in future replicated studies.",2015,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD
Self-similar processes with independent increments,"SummaryA stochastic process {Xtâˆ¶t â‰§0} onRd is called wide-sense self-similar if, for eachc>0, there are a positive numbera and a functionb(t) such that {Xct} and {aXt+b(t)} have common finite-dimensional distributions. If {Xt} is widesense self-similar with independent increments, stochastically continuous, andX0=const, then, for everyt, the distribution ofXt is of classL. Conversely, if Î¼ is a distribution of classL, then, for everyH>0, there is a unique process {X(H)t} selfsimilar with exponentH with independent increments such thatX1 has distribution Î¼. Consequences of this characterization are discussed. The properties (finitedimensional distributions, behaviors for small time, etc.) of the process {X(H)t} (called the process of classL with exponentH induced by Î¼) are compared with those of the LÃ©vy process {Yt} such thatY1 has distribution Î¼. Results are generalized to operator-self-similar processes and distributions of classOL. A process {Xt} onRd is called wide-sense operator-self-similar if, for eachc>0, there are a linear operatorAc and a functionbc(t) such that {Xct} and {AcXt+bc(t)} have common finite-dimensional distributions. It is proved that, if {Xt} is wide-sense operator-self-similar and stochastically continuous, then theAc can be chosen asAc=cQ with a linear operatorQ with some special spectral properties. This is an extension of a theorem of Hudson and Mason [4].",1991,Probability Theory and Related Fields
"Hydrothermal andalusite and corundum in a potassic alteration zone around a proterozoic Gabbro-Tonalite-Granite intrusion NE of Persberg, Central Sweden","SummaryThe mineral associations quartz-microcline-sericite/muscovite-andalusite, corundumandalusite-kaolinite and quartz-andalusite-kaolinite occurring in potassically altered felsic metavolcanic rocks around a gabbro-tonalite-granite stock are interpreted to be of hydrothermal origin. These assemblages put constraints on the PT-conditions of intrusion of a hybrid mafic-felsic magma and associated hydrothermal alteration. Potassic alteration had a thermal maximum above 550 Â°C; subsequent argillic alteration culminated at about 450 Â°C. Pressures probably never exceeded 0.5 Kbar. The mafic-felsic intrusive was emplaced in a high-level environment and argillic alteration most likely resulted from cooler waters moving into the still hot country rocks after collapse of the hydrothermal system.ZusammenfassungDer Ursprung der Mineralassoziationen Quarz-Mikroklin-Serizit/Muskovit-Andalusit, Korund-Andalusit-Kaolinit und Quarz-Andalusit-Kaolinit, die in KaliumverÃ¤nderten felsischen Metavulkaniten um einen Gabbro-Tonalit-Granit-Stock auftre ten, wird hydrothermal gedeutet.

New Robust Variable Selection Methods for Linear Regression Models,"type=""main"" xml:id=""sjos12057-abs-0001""> Motivated by an entropy inequality, we propose for the first time a penalized profile likelihood method for simultaneously selecting significant variables and estimating unknown coefficients in multiple linear regression models in this article. The new method is robust to outliers or errors with heavy tails and works well even for error with infinite variance. Our proposed approach outperforms the adaptive lasso in both theory and practice. It is observed from the simulation studies that (i) the new approach possesses higher probability of correctly selecting the exact model than the least absolute deviation lasso and the adaptively penalized composite quantile regression approach and (ii) exact model selection via our proposed approach is robust regardless of the error distribution.

Historical biogeography of a new antitropical clade of temperate freshwater fishes,"Aim 
Any discovery of new biogeographical pattern in landlocked animals may challenge hypotheses that account for the evolution of intercontinental faunas. In this study, we examined the evolutionary origin and historical biogeography of temperate, freshwater perch-like fishes within a molecular phylogenetic framework. 
 
Location 
Temperate Eastern Eurasia, the Americas and Australia. 
 
Methods 
Data from five nuclear markers obtained from 15 targeted species and a broad sampling of percomorphs were assembled to investigate their phylogeny and historical biogeography. We (1) applied a fossil-calibrated Bayesian reconstruction to provide a phylogenetic time-scale for the diversification of the taxa, (2) inferred the evolution of habitat preference through a tree-based character reconstruction method, and (3) reconstructed the evolution of range distributions using a dispersalâ€“extinctionâ€“cladogenesis model. 
 
Results 
We recovered a new antitropical freshwater clade, Percichthyoidea, composed of Sinipercidae, Percichthyidae (including Percilia but excluding Macquaria colonorum), Elassomatidae and Centrarchidae. Our time-scale analysis indicates that the Percichthyoidea originated around the Cretaceousâ€“Palaeogene transition. Ancestral habitat reconstructions revealed only one marine-to-freshwater transition that preceded the origin of the percichthyoids; the warm-to-temperate transition occurred earlier. Ancestral-area inference indicates a wide-ranging pan-American and Eastern Eurasian distribution of the most recent common ancestor of Percichthyoidea. The initial diversification event occurred between the southern (Percichthyidae) and northern (remaining percichthyoids) clades. A second divergence occurred between Eastern Eurasia (Sinipercidae) and North America (Centrarchidae plus Elassomatidae). The trans-Pacific distribution of the Percichthyidae may have preceded the final breakup of south Gondwana. 
 
Main conclusions 
The present-day distribution of the Percichthyoidea is unique within extant fishes, comprising four trans-Pacific continental blocks across the two hemispheres. Current geological and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions may well explain the longitudinal but not the latitudinal pattern of this freshwater fish clade, as it requires a transequatorial freshwater system connecting temperate regions of South and North America during the Late Cretaceous/Palaeogene. An alternative hypothesis is discussed, in which the ancestor of the Percichthyoidea was not completely adapted to freshwater.",2014,Journal of Biogeography
-based Economy,"The development of knowledge-intensive business services in recent decades can be interpreted as one of the indicators of a transformation from an industrial economy into a knowledge-based one. Not only do quantitative measures, whether in the form of sales or employment figures (e.g. Chadwick, Glasson and Lawton Smith, 2008), undoubtedly show the expansion of these services; but also their characteristics make it clear that they significantly affect the formation and spread of knowledge throughout the economy.

Absence of exit block due to direct capture of the left atrial appendage: A visual confirmation,"Case report A 69-year-old man with symptomatic longstanding persistent AF of 2 yearsâ€™ duration underwent a hybrid AF ablation procedure. His medication consisted of flecainide, metoprolol, and warfarin. Antiarrhythmic drugs were stopped 5 days before the procedure. Via a bilateral thoracoscopic approach, we isolated the pulmonary veins (PVs) in pairs using a bipolar radiofrequency clamp (Atricure, West Chester, OH). AF organized into left atrial (LA) flutter. A His bundle catheter (St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN) and coronary sinus catheter (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) were inserted. After transseptal puncture, a long sheath (SL0; St Jude Medical) was advanced from the groin into the LA, and the patient was fully heparinized. A roofline connecting both superior PVs was made using a bipolar radiofrequency linear pen device (Atricure, West Chester, OH). Since this resulted in conversion (of LA flutter) to sinus rhythm, the flutter probably was LA roof-dependent. We then placed a circular mapping catheter (Lasso; Biosense Webster Inc, Diamond Bar, CA) at the ostium of the left superior PV (LSPV). The thoracoscopic view from the left side of the patient makes clear how the left atrial appendage (LAA) lies on top of the LSPV (Figure 1A).

Prediction of Underling Sinus Node Dysfunction during Chronic Atrial Fibrillation before Catheter Ablation Using Apnea/Hypopnea Index,"Background: Indication of ablation has been expanded to include chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF) for enabling high degree of sinus rhythm maintenance. We have encountered patients undergoing pacemaker implantation, in whom sick sinus syndrome became clinically evident after ablation. The study aims to investigate whether underling sinus node dysfunction (SND) during CAF can be predicted before deciding the indication for ablation. Methods and Results: Sixty consecutive patients with CAF who underwent ablation between January to December 2010 were enrolled in the study. Nocturnal polysomnography as well as echocardiography was performed for all patients before ablation. We used the double Lasso catheter and electro anatomical mapping guided extensive encircling pulmonary vein isolation (EEPVI). We performed electrophysiological studies after EEPVI, and SND was defined as corrected SN recovery time of â‰¥550 ms. SND was detected in 26 (43%) patients (SND group); the other patients showed normal sinus node function (NSN group). The apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was significantly greater in the SND group than in the NSN group (25.7Â±13 vs 15.8Â±10, P=0.0022). On multivariate analysis, sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) was an independent predictor of SND after ablation for CAF. Conclusion: This study suggested that underlying SND in CAF patients can be predicted by evaluating SAS before ablation.",2011,Journal of Arrhythmia

Expanding the Domain of Postinfectious Glomerulonephritis.,"To the Editor: The article on infection-related glomerulonephritis (GN) by Glassock et al emphasizes the important differences between true â€œpostinfectious GN,â€ such as poststreptococcal GN, and infectionassociated GN, such as the IgA-dominant lesion associated with ongoing staphylococcal infection. There is another category of GN that we believe should also be included in the domain of â€œpostinfectious GN,â€ which is defined by the authors as including a latent period following an infection â€œlasting more than several days and up to a few weeks, during which the patient returns to or toward his or her usual state of health; and.ends with the acute onset of features of glomerulonephritis.and often some decrease in kidney functionâ€. Recent studies suggest that infections have a much wider role in GN, not only through the serum sicknessâ€“like mechanisms reviewed in the article from Glassock et al, but also because they initiate an autoimmune response. We have recently reviewed the multiple mechanisms by which infections likely initiate many common types of autoimmune GN, including ANCA-associated vasculitis, IgA nephropathy, membranoproliferative GN type 1, and lupus nephritis. Thus, the domain of postinfectious GN extends well beyond classical poststreptococcal disease or entities such as IgA-dominant staphylococcus-associated GN. We strongly endorse the goal of better understanding and treating infection-related GN that is stated in the title of the article by Glassock et al, but to achieve this, we need to extend our thinking about postinfectious GN beyond the traditional concepts of serum sickness due to bovine serum albumin to include the role of infections initiating GN through autoimmune mechanisms.",2015,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation
User-study Based Optimization of Fast and Accurate Mahalanobis Brushing in Scatterplots,"Brushing is at the heart of most modern visual analytics solutions with coordinated, multiple views and effective brushing is crucial for swift and efficient processes in data exploration and analysis. Given a certain data subset that the user wishes to brush in a data visualization, traditional brushes are usually either accurate (like the lasso) or fast (e.g., a simple geometry like a rectangle or circle). In this paper, we now present a new, fast and accurate brushing technique for scatterplots, based on the Mahalanobis brush, which we have extended and then optimized using data from a user study. We explain the principal, sketchbased model of our new brushing technique (based on a simple click-and-drag interaction), the details of the user study and the related parameter optimization, as well as a quantitative evaluation, considering efficiency, accuracy, and also a comparison with the original Mahalanobis brush.

"Multi-modality neuroimaging brain-age in UK Biobank: relationship to biomedical, lifestyle and cognitive factors","The brain-age paradigm is proving increasingly useful for exploring aging-related disease and can predict important future health outcomes. Most brain-age research uses structural neuroimaging to index brain volume. However, aging affects multiple aspects of brain structure and function, which can be examined using multimodality neuroimaging. Using UK Biobank, brain-age was modeled in nÂ = 2205 healthy people with T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, T2âˆ—, diffusion-MRI, task fMRI, and resting-state fMRI. In a held-out healthy validation set (nÂ = 520), chronological age was accurately predicted (rÂ = 0.78, mean absolute errorÂ = 3.55Â years) using LASSO regression, higher than using any modality separately. Thirty-four neuroimaging phenotypes were deemed informative by the regression (after bootstrapping); predominantly gray-matter volume and white-matter microstructure measures. When applied to new individuals from UK Biobank (nÂ = 14,701), significant associations with multimodality brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) were found for stroke history, diabetes diagnosis, smoking, alcohol intake and some, but not all, cognitive measures (corrected p < 0.05). Multimodality neuroimaging can improve brain-age prediction, and derived brain-PAD values are sensitive to biomedical and lifestyle factors that negatively impact brain and cognitive health.",2020,Neurobiology of aging
Identification and Validation of an Individualized Prognostic Signature of Bladder Cancer Based on Seven Immune Related Genes,"Background There has been no report of prognostic signature based on immune-related genes (IRGs). This study aimed to develop an IRG-based prognostic signature that could stratify patients with bladder cancer (BLCA). Methods RNA-seq data along with clinical information on BLCA were retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and gene expression omnibus (GEO). Based on TCGA dataset, differentially expressed IRGs were identified via Wilcoxon test. Among these genes, prognostic IRGs were identified using univariate Cox regression analysis. Subsequently, we split TCGA dataset into the training (n = 284) and test datasets (n = 119). Based on the training dataset, we built a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized Cox proportional hazards regression model with multiple prognostic IRGs. It was validated in the training dataset, test dataset, and external dataset GSE13507 (n = 165). Additionally, we accessed the six types of tumor-infiltrating immune cells from Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) website and analyzed the difference between risk groups. Further, we constructed and validated a nomogram to tailor treatment for patients with BLCA. Results A set of 47 prognostic IRGs was identified. LASSO regression and identified seven BLCA-specific prognostic IRGs, i.e., RBP7, PDGFRA, AHNAK, OAS1, RAC3, EDNRA, and SH3BP2. We developed an IRG-based prognostic signature that stratify BLCA patients into two subgroups with statistically different survival outcomes [hazard ratio (HR) = 10, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.6â€“19, P < 0.001]. The ROC curve analysis showed acceptable discrimination with AUCs of 0.711, 0.754, and 0.772 at 1-, 3-, and 5-year follow-up respectively. The predictive performance was validated in the train set, test set, and external dataset GSE13507. Besides, the increased infiltration of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophage, neutrophil, and dendritic cells in the high-risk group (as defined by the signature) indicated chronic inflammation may reduce the survival chances of BLCA patients. The nomogram demonstrated to be clinically-relevant and effective with accurate prediction and positive net benefit. Conclusion The present immune-related signature can effectively classify BLCA patients into high-risk and low-risk groups in terms of survival rate, which may help select high-risk BLCA patients for more intensive treatment.",2020,Frontiers in Genetics

Sparse Regression with Multi-type Regularized Feature Modeling.,"Within the statistical and machine learning literature, regularization techniques are often used to construct sparse (predictive) models. Most regularization strategies only work for data where all predictors are of the same type, such as Lasso regression for continuous predictors. However, many predictive problems involve different predictor types. We propose a multi-type Lasso penalty that acts on the objective function as a sum of subpenalties, one for each predictor type. As such, we perform predictor selection and level fusion within a predictor in a data-driven way, simultaneous with the parameter estimation process. We develop a new estimation strategy for convex predictive models with this multi-type penalty. Using the theory of proximal operators, our estimation procedure is computationally efficient, partitioning the overall optimization problem into easier to solve subproblems, specific for each predictor type and its associated penalty. The proposed SMuRF algorithm improves on existing solvers in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This is demonstrated with an extensive simulation study and the analysis of a case-study on insurance pricing analytics.",2018,arXiv: Computation
"Gaseous emissions of nitrogen and carbon from urban vegetable gardens in Boboâ€Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) is an important livelihood strategy for the urban poor in sub-Saharan Africa and contributes to meeting increasing food demands in the rapidly growing cities. Although in recent years many research activities have been geared towards enhancing the productivity of this land-use system, little is known about turnover processes and nutrient efficiency of UPA. The aim of our study therefore was to determine horizontal fluxes of N, P, K, and C as well as gaseous N and C emissions in urban vegetable gardens of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Two gardens referred to as â€œKodeniâ€ and â€œKuinimaâ€ were selected as representative for urban and peri-urban systems classified as: (1) â€œcommercial gardening + field crops and livestock systemâ€ and (2) â€œcommercial gardening and semicommercial field crop systemâ€, respectively. A nutrient-balance approach was used to monitor matter fluxes from March 2008 to March 2009 in both gardens. Ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the respective soils were measured during the coolest and the hottest period of the day using a closed-chamber system. Annual partial balances amounted to 2056â€‰kg N haâ€“1, 615â€‰kg P haâ€“1, 1864â€‰kg K haâ€“1, and 33â€‰893â€‰kg C haâ€“1 at Kodeni and to 1752â€‰kg N haâ€“1, 446â€‰kg P haâ€“1, 1643â€‰kg K haâ€“1, and 21â€‰021â€‰kg C haâ€“1 at Kuinima. Emission rates were highest during the hot midday hours with peaks after fertilizer applications when fluxes of up to 1140 g NH3-N haâ€“1 hâ€“1, 154 g N2O-N haâ€“1 hâ€“1, 12Â 993 g CO2-C haâ€“1 hâ€“1 were recorded for Kodeni and Kuinima. Estimated annual gaseous N (NH3-N + N2O-N) and C (CO2-C + CH4-C) losses reached 419â€‰kg N haâ€“1 and 35â€‰862â€‰kg C haâ€“1 at Kodeni and 347â€‰kg N haâ€“1 and 22Â 364â€‰kg C haâ€“1 at Kuinima. For both gardens, this represented 20% and 106% of the N and C surpluses, respectively. Emissions of NH3, largely emitted after surface application of manure and mineral fertilizers, accounted for 73% and 77% of total estimated N losses for Kodeni and Kuinima. To mitigate N losses nutrient-management practices in UPA vegetable production of Bobo-Dioulasso would greatly benefit from better synchronizing nutrient-input rates with crop demands.",2012,Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science
Identification of miRNA profiling in prediction of tumor recurrence and progress and bioinformatics analysis for patients with primary esophageal cancer: Study based on TCGA database.,"OBJECT
This study focused on the identification of prognostic miRNAs for the prediction of tumor recurrence and progress in esophageal cancer.


METHODS
MiRNA profiling and clinical characteristics of esophageal cancer patients was downloaded from the TCGA database. Univariate analysis was performed to select potential prognostic miRNAs and covariates. LASSO based logistic regression was conducted to identify the prognostic miRNAs given covariates. Bioinformatics analysis including gene ontology, disease ontology and pathway enrichment analysis were performed. A nomogram was generated based on multivariate logistic regression to illustrate the association between the identified miRNAs and the risk of tumor recurrence and progress.


RESULTS
A total of 1881 miRNAs and 10 clinical characteristics were obtained from TCGA database. 18 miRNAs were finally identified in which 6 miRNAs were identified for the first time to be associated with the tumor recurrence and progress of esophageal cancer given covariates. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the identified miRNAs were associated with the tumor recurrence and progress of esophageal cancer. The association between identified miRNAs and risk of tumor recurrence and progress were presented in a nomogram.


CONCLUSION
The 6 newly identified miRNAs may be potential biomarkers for the prediction of tumor recurrence and progress of esophageal cancer.",2018,"Pathology, research and practice"

Berwin's Problem,"The title Lasso has been suggested by Tibshirani 6] as a colourful description of a technique for variable selection which requires the minimization of a sum of squares subject to an l1 bound on the solution components.

Their 16S rRNA gene sequences were identical to each other. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that they belong to the genus Thalassospira, and shared 97.5-98.3â€Š%â€‰sequence similarity to all other validly type strains of the genus Thalassospira, and the highest similarity was to the type strain Thalassospira povalilyticaZumi 95T (98.3â€Š%), followed by Thalassospira australica NP3b2T (98.2â€Š%). The digital DNA-DNA hybridization value between the two strains was 80.4â€Š%, while the values with T. povalilyticaZumi 95T and T. australica NP3b2T were only 20.5-20.7â€Š%â€‰and 20.4-20.5â€Š%, respectively. The two strains possess similar major cellular fatty acids including C18â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰7c, C16â€Š:â€Š0, C19â€Š:â€Š0Ï‰8c cyclo, C18â€Š:â€Š1 2-OH and C17â€Š:â€Š0 cyclo.

A 7-lncRNA signature associated with the prognosis of colon adenocarcinoma,"Background
Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is the most common colon cancer exhibiting high mortality. Due to their association with cancer progression, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are now being used as prognostic biomarkers. In the present study, we used relevant clinical information and expression profiles of lncRNAs originating from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, aiming to construct a prognostic lncRNA signature to estimate the prognosis of patients.


Methods
The samples were randomly spilt into training and validation cohorts. In the training cohort, prognosis-related lncRNAs were selected from differentially expressed lncRNAs using the univariate Cox analysis. Furthermore, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox analysis were employed for identifying prognostic lncRNAs. The prognostic signature was constructed by these lncRNAs.


Results
The prognostic model was able to calculate each COAD patient's risk score and split the patients into groups of low and high risks. Compared to the low-risk group, the high-risk group had significant poor prognosis. Next, the prognostic signature was validated in the validation, as well as all cohorts. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and c-index were determined in all cohorts. Moreover, these prognostic lncRNA signatures were combined with clinicopathological risk factors to construct a nomogram for predicting the prognosis of COAD in the clinic. Finally, seven lncRNAs (CTC-273B12.10, AC009404.2, AC073283.7, RP11-167H9.4, AC007879.7, RP4-816N1.7, and RP11-400N13.2) were identified and validated by different cohorts. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis of the mRNAs co-expressed with the seven prognostic lncRNAs suggested four significantly upregulated pathways, which were AGE-RAGE, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.


Conclusion
Thus, our study verified that the seven lncRNAs mentioned can be used as biomarkers to predict the prognosis of COAD patients and design personalized treatments.",2020,PeerJ

Abstract Objective : To analyze the outcomes of surgical procedures for the management of urethral strictures in three medical center of Burkina Faso. Materials and methods: we performed a retrospective descriptive and analytical study including 148 cases of urethral stricture between 1st January 2006 to 30 June 2011 in three medical centres: the CHU Yalgado Ouedraogo of Ouagadougou, the CHU Souro Sanou of Bobo-Dioulasso and the CMA Schiphra de Ouagadougou. After one month following the indwelling catheter ablation the criteria of judgment of the results were based on clinical and radiological data: i) Good results: no voiding dysfunction, absence of post voiding residual and/or normal urethrocystography, ii) failure: persistence of voiding dysfunction and/or stricture recurrence at urethrocystography. Results: The average age of the patients was 44.4 +/-16,8 years (Min 8, Max 80). In 70,3 % of the cases, the stricture was localized on anterior urethra. Cutaneous pediculate flap and the resection and end-to-end anastomosis (REEA) were the most used treatments in 58% of patients. 12 patients (8,1 %) had immediate post-operative adverses events dominated by wound infection (6,8 %, n=9). The failures rates after one month of follow-up were 13.5 %, 12.2 %, 0 % respectively for the internal endoscopic urethrotomy, REEA, and the uretroplasty by penile pediculated flap. There was no significant correlation (p=0,15) between the type of surgical treatment and the therapeutic result. Conclusion: The short and medium-term results of the surgical treatments of urethral stricture were good in our study regardless of the surgical procedure. Further Randomized studies are necessary to better estimate and compare the results of the various surgical techniques of treatment. Keywords: urethral stricture, endoscopic urethrotomy, urethroplasty, cutaneous flap",2015,
Glioblastoma and Anaplastic Astrocytoma: Differentiation Using MRI Texture Analysis,"Introduction: Glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma (ANA) are two of the most common primary brain tumors in adults. The differential diagnosis is important for treatment recommendations and prognosis assessment. This study aimed to assess the discriminative ability of texture analysis using machine learning to distinguish glioblastoma from ANA. Methods: A total of 123 patients with glioblastoma (n = 76) or ANA (n = 47) were enrolled in this study. Texture features were extracted from contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance (MR) images using LifeX package. Three independent feature-selection methods were performed to select the most discriminating parameters:Distance Correlation, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and gradient correlation decision tree (GBDT). These selected features (datasets) were then randomly split into the training and the validation group at the ratio of 4:1 and were fed into linear discriminant analysis (LDA), respectively, and independently. The standard sensitivity, specificity, the areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy were calculated for both training and validation group. Results: All three models (Distance Correlation + LDA, LASSO + LDA and GBDT + LDA) showed promising ability to discriminate glioblastoma from ANA, with AUCs â‰¥0.95 for both the training and the validation group using LDA algorithm and no overfitting was observed. LASSO + LDA showed the best discriminative ability in horizontal comparison among three models. Conclusion: Our study shows that MRI texture analysis using LDA algorithm had promising ability to discriminate glioblastoma from ANA. Multi-center studies with greater number of patients are warranted in future studies to confirm the preliminary result.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Validation of prediction models based on lasso regression with multiply imputed data,"BackgroundIn prognostic studies, the lasso technique is attractive since it improves the quality of predictions by shrinking regression coefficients, compared to predictions based on a model fitted via unpenalized maximum likelihood. Since some coefficients are set to zero, parsimony is achieved as well. It is unclear whether the performance of a model fitted using the lasso still shows some optimism. Bootstrap methods have been advocated to quantify optimism and generalize model performance to new subjects. It is unclear how resampling should be performed in the presence of multiply imputed data.MethodThe data were based on a cohort of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease patients. We constructed models to predict Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire dyspnea 6 months ahead. Optimism of the lasso model was investigated by comparing 4 approaches of handling multiply imputed data in the bootstrap procedure, using the study data and simulated data sets. In the first 3 approaches, data sets that had been completed via multiple imputation (MI) were resampled, while the fourth approach resampled the incomplete data set and then performed MI.ResultsThe discriminative model performance of the lasso was optimistic. There was suboptimal calibration due to over-shrinkage. The estimate of optimism was sensitive to the choice of handling imputed data in the bootstrap resampling procedure. Resampling the completed data sets underestimates optimism, especially if, within a bootstrap step, selected individuals differ over the imputed data sets. Incorporating the MI procedure in the validation yields estimates of optimism that are closer to the true value, albeit slightly too larger.ConclusionPerformance of prognostic models constructed using the lasso technique can be optimistic as well. Results of the internal validation are sensitive to how bootstrap resampling is performed.",2014,BMC Medical Research Methodology
"Geographic variation in size at age of the coral reef fish, Thalassoma lunare (family: Labridae) : a contribution to life history theory.","Key life history traits such as age at maturity, longevity and mortality have all shown correlations with body size. However, the relationship between age and size is particularly important as growth rates (size per time) can have a profound influence on reproductive capabilities and survival. This is especially so in the context of trade-offs between traits, where fast growth may reduce survivability. One way to test trade-offs between life history traits such as growth, reproduction and survival is to examine phenotypic correlations between distinct populations. Life history attributes of populations have been shown to vary over large geographical ranges, in particular those involving a latitudinal or altitudinal gradient. Temperature is likely to be a particularly important factor influencing life histories at these scales, especially for those animals that rely on external sources for body heat. Numerous studies of terrestrial ectotherms have shown that at higher latitudes (or altitudes) body size is often larger than that of lower latitudes. Furthermore, life history theory predicts that at higher latitudes (lower temperatures) individuals should exhibit larger final body sizes but smaller size at age (i.e. slower growth). With slower growth there is likely to be a trend towards later maturation, but greater longevity. With later maturation (at larger sizes) reproductive effort is delayed, however there is the potential for greater fecundity (assuming fecundity increases with body size). However, these theoretical predictions were yet to be tested in coral reef fish. Therefore, the objective of this project was to examine age-based parameters in discrete populations of Thalassoma lunare, a widespread and opportunistic wrasse, to evaluate whether reef fish fit predictions of traditional life history theory. Addressing this question is fundamental to our understanding of reef fish populations, the dynamics of interactions and the diversity of coral reef fish. Thalassoma lunare is widely distributed, found along much of the East Australian coastline, surrounding Pacific Islands and Indian Ocean. Thalassoma lunare is found throughout both inshore, midshelf and outer shelf reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, temperate rocky reef systems and exposed, sheltered and lagoonal sites. Therefore, it was an ideal study organism to look at regional scales for the determination of life history trade-offs in coral reef fishes. The broad aims of this project, therefore, were to 1) describe the age-based biology of T.",2004,
A Comparison of the Lasso and Marginal Regression,"The lasso is an important method for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems, with efficient algorithms available, a long history of practical success, and a large body of theoretical results supporting and explaining its performance. But even with the best available algorithms, finding the lasso solutions remains a computationally challenging task in cases where the number of covariates vastly exceeds the number of data points. 
 
Marginal regression, where each dependent variable is regressed separately on each covariate, offers a promising alternative in this case because the estimates can be computed roughly two orders faster than the lasso solutions. The question that remains is how the statistical performance of the method compares to that of the lasso in these cases. 
 
In this paper, we study the relative statistical performance of the lasso and marginal regression for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems. We consider the problem of learning which coefficients are non-zero. Our main results are as follows: (i) we compare the conditions under which the lasso and marginal regression guarantee exact recovery in the fixed design, noise free case; (ii) we establish conditions under which marginal regression provides exact recovery with high probability in the fixed design, noise free, random coefficients case; and (iii) we derive rates of convergence for both procedures, where performance is measured by the number of coefficients with incorrect sign, and characterize the regions in the parameter space recovery is and is not possible under this metric. 
 
In light of the computational advantages of marginal regression in very high dimensional problems, our theoretical and simulations results suggest that the procedure merits further study.",2012,J. Mach. Learn. Res.
Fast Exact Bayesian Inference for Sparse Signals in the Normal Sequence Model,"We consider exact algorithms for Bayesian inference with model selection priors (including spike-and-slab priors) in the sparse normal sequence model. Because the best existing exact algorithm becomes numerically unstable for sample sizes over n=500, there has been much attention for alternative approaches like approximate algorithms (Gibbs sampling, variational Bayes, etc.), shrinkage priors (e.g. the Horseshoe prior and the Spike-and-Slab LASSO) or empirical Bayesian methods. However, by introducing algorithmic ideas from online sequential prediction, we show that exact calculations are feasible for much larger sample sizes: for general model selection priors we reach n=25000, and for certain spike-and-slab priors we can easily reach n=100000. We further prove a de Finetti-like result for finite sample sizes that characterizes exactly which model selection priors can be expressed as spike-and-slab priors. Finally, the computational speed and numerical accuracy of the proposed methods are demonstrated in experiments on simulated data and on a prostate cancer data set. In our experimental evaluation we compute guaranteed bounds on the numerical accuracy of all new algorithms, which shows that the proposed methods are numerically reliable whereas an alternative based on long division is not.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
A New Species of Halichoeres (Teleostei: Labridae) from the Western Gulf of Mexico,"Abstract A new labrid fish, Halichoeres burekae, is described from specimens collected at Stetson Bank, Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS), in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico over claystone, sponge, and coral substrata. The bright purple, blue-green, and yellow body coloration, and anterior black pigmentation of the dorsal fin in the terminal male, large black irregular spot at the base of the caudal peduncle, salmon body coloration, yellow snout in the initial stage/female, and diagnostic differences in the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene separate this species from all other western Atlantic labrids. Adult H. burekae were observed in small schools along the reef crest mixed with Thalassoma bifasciatum and Chromis multilineata, and small juveniles were observed in mixed schools with juvenile Clepticus parrae. It feeds primarily on calanoid copepods and other plankton and is a close relative of H. socialis from Belize. This species is currently known from the FGBNMS and reefs off Veracruz, Mexico, in the western Gulf of Mexico.",2007,Copeia
A prognostic 4-gene expression signature for squamous cell lung carcinoma.,"Squamous cell lung carcinoma (SQCLC), a common and fatal subtype of lung cancer, caused lots of mortalities and showed different outcomes in prognosis. This study was to screen key genes and to figure a prognostic signature to cluster the patients with SQCLC. RNA-Seq data from 550 patients with SQCLC were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Genetically changed genes were identified and analyzed in univariate survival analysis. Genes significantly influencing prognosis were selected with frequency higher than 100 in lasso regression. Meanwhile, area under the curve (AUC) values and hazard ratios (HR) for seed genes were obtained with R Language. Functional enrichment analysis was performed and clustering effectiveness of the selected common gene set was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier. Finally, the stability and validity of the optimal clustering model were verified. A total of 7,222 genetically changed genes were screened, including 1,045 ones with pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, 1,746, pâ€‰<â€‰0.1, and 2,758, pâ€‰<â€‰0.2. The common gene sets with more than 100 frequencies were 14-Genes, 10-Genes and 6-Genes. Genes with pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 participated in positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade, angiogenesis, platelet degranulation, cell-matrix adhesion, extracellular matrix organization, macrophage activation, and so on. A four-gene clustering model in 14-Genes (DPPA, TTTY16, TRIM58, HKDC1, ZNF589, ALDH7A1, LINC01426, IL19, LOC101928358, TMEM92, HRASLS, JPH1, LOC100288778, GCGR) was verified as the optimal. The discovery of four-gene clustering model in 14-Genes can cluster the patient samples effectively.

Stent-graft narrowed with a lasso catheter: an adjustable TIPS reduction technique.,"The authors describe an endovascular technique to reduce shunt diameter in the management of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)-induced refractory hepatic encephalopathy. Five patients were treated with a constrained stent-graft by using a commercially available balloon-expandable stent-graft narrowed by using a lasso catheter. This offers the possibility of an adjustable reduction of the shunt diameter. All procedures were technically successful, resulting in a significant increase in the portosystemic gradient and reopacification of the intrahepatic portal vein branches, findings that correlated with clinical improvement. This technique provides the ability to titrate the portosystemic gradient to the desired endpoint during shunt reduction.",2010,Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR
Penalized regression combining the L1 norm and a correlation based penalty,"We consider the problem of feature selection in linear regression model with p covariates and n observations. We propose a new method to simultaneously select variables and favor a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The method is based on penalized least squares with a penalty function that combines the L1 and a Correlation based Penalty (CP) norms. We call it L1CP method. Like the Lasso penalty, L1CP shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero and additionally, the CP term explicitly links strength of penalization to the correlation among predictors. A detailed simulation study in small and high dimensional settings is performed. It illustrates the advantages of our approach compared to several alternatives. Finally, we apply the methodology to two real data sets: US Crime Data and GC-Retention PAC data. In terms of prediction accuracy and estimation error, our empirical study suggests that the L1CP is more adapted than the Elastic-Net to situations where p â‰¤ n (the number of variables is less or equal to the sample size). If p â‰« n, our method remains competitive and also allows the selection of more than n variables.",2014,Sankhya
Food Habits of Key Groundfish Species in the Eastern Bering Sea Slope Region,"The eastern Bering Sea continental slope region contains many groundfish species that are important to the Bering Sea ecosystem. Several studies have described the food habits of these species in the eastern Bering Sea shelf region, however few studies have been conducted for the slope region. Consequently, the food habits of the major groundfish in this region are poorly understood. The focus of this study was to identify the trophic interactions of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), and flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) in the slope region of the eastern Bering Sea. Stomach contents of 1,089 walleye pollock, 311 Pacific cod, 455 Greenland halibut, 282 arrowtooth flounder, and 366 flathead sole were examined. The general diet of each species is described and dietary variation due to predator size, depth, season, and latitude within the slope region are examined. Walleye pollock are known to be the most important prey fish in the eastern Bering Sea shelf region. In the slope region, species from the families Bathylagidae and Myctophidae were found, in addition to pollock, to be important forage fish of groundfish predators",1996,
"Early to Middle Jurassic vegetation and climatic events in the Qaidam Basin, northwest China","Abstract Jurassic deposits are well exposed in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai Province, northwest China, and are regarded as one of the most completely developed Earlyâ€“Middle Jurassic plant-bearing sequences in northern China. The Early to Middle Jurassic palynoflora in this basin shows a high diversity of spores and pollen grains, which are characterized by four palynological assemblage zones corresponding to the Pliensbachian, Toarcian, Aalenianâ€“Bajocian and Bathonian in age. Vegetation reconstruction demonstrates four vegetation types: upland coniferous forest in the Pliensbachian, coastal cheirolepidiacean forest in the Toarcian, lowland fern forest in the Aalenianâ€“Bajocian and a mixed forest in the Bathonian. Nearest living relative analysis of the major plant groups shows that the Early to Middle Jurassic vegetation in the Qaidam Basin not only consists of plants with tropicalâ€“subtropical climate requirements, but also those indicating temperate climatic conditions. In addition, bryophytes and fungi as well as Cheirolepidiaceae, which are generally considered to indicate warmer and/or drier conditions, are also documented in the palynofloras. It is suggested that a temperate to subtropical climate generally prevailed during the Early to Middle Jurassic in this basin. However, the vegetation features and the sedimentary data signify that an overall humid to semi-humid phase was punctuated by warmer and locally dry and/or arid episodes. The two higher temperature and aridity events occurred in the Toarcian and Bathonian-Callovian periods in the Qaidam Basin. These climatic events can be inferred by increase of relative abundance of Classopollis pollen, some tropicalâ€“subtropical fern spores, and the occurrences of variegated, red beds and evaporite rocks. These events may either be associated in some way with a transient global warming phenomenon due to an enhanced greenhouse effect, or be linked with intensification of a potential monsoonal circulation. Such events finally caused a weakening and even arrested coal-accumulation in the Qaidam Basin during the Toarcian and the Bathonian-Callovian intervals.",2005,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"
Prediction of Critical Clearing Time for Transient Stability Based on Ensemble Extreme Learning Machine Regression Model,"To improve the accuracy of critical clearing time (CCT) prediction model, an ensemble regression learning method is employed, and a CCT prediction method based on the ensemble extreme learning machine regression model is proposed. First, the static power flow values are utilized as the original feature set, and the least absolute shrinkage selection operator (Lasso) is used for determining the input features. The extreme learning machine, regarded as the base learner, is used to establish the mapping relationship between the input features and CCT value. On this basis, the AdaBoost.RT algorithm is employed as the ensemble regression learning framework to construct multiple base learners. When performing CCT prediction, the predicted values of each base learner are weight integration to obtain the final prediction result. Simulation results on New England 39-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2019,2019 IEEE Innovative Smart Grid Technologies - Asia (ISGT Asia)
Variable selection. Editorial.,"In the past 10 years, the development of statistical methods has been greatly shaped by the demand of analyzing high-dimensional data generated in the fields of biological and medical sciences. Variable selection is a fundamental task in analyzing modern high-dimensional data. Many papers have been devoted to this important topic. Methods such as LASSO and SCAD are now household names in the literature. This special issue comprises five invited contributions from some leading experts in this area, with emphasis on solving interesting application problems. BÃ¼hlmann, RÃ¼timann and Kalisch provided a very nice review article on two widely applicable variable selection techniques: stability selection and aggregated multiple p-values. Both techniques are based on sub-sampling and aim to control false positive selections in observational data analysis. Lu, Zhang and Zeng presented a new variable selection method that is designed to identify important variables involved in optimal treatment decision-making. Their method is based on a penalized regression framework and can be easily implemented by existing software packages. The new method is illustrated with an application to an AIDS clinical trial. Jiang, Huang and Zhang studied a new cross-validated area under the ROC curve (CV-AUC) criterion for tuning parameter selection for sparely penalized logistic regression. The CV-AUC criterion is specifically designed for optimizing the classification performance for binary outcome data. It is shown that CV-AUC outperforms other popular competitors such as AIC, BIC or E-BIC. CV-AUC is used to select genes related to cancer based on microarray data. The survey paper by Zhang and Lin focuses on six important properties for high-dimension-lowsample-size classification problems: predictability, consistency, generality, stochastic stability, robustness and interpretability/sparsity. The authors reviewed several popular classifiers and compared their performance on simulated and real data. Li and Tibshirani proposed a new method for the identification of features that are associated with an outcome variable in RNA-Seq data. Their method is non-parametric and hence more robust than those parametric competitors that are based on Poisson or negative-binomial models. The new method is general enough to be applied to data with quantitative, survival, two-class or multipleclass outcomes. We hope that the readers find this special issue interesting and inspiring. Finally, we want to thank all authors and referees for their enthusiastic support.",2013,Statistical methods in medical research
The Clinical Picture of Psychosis in Manifest Huntington's Disease: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Enroll-HD Database,"Background: Psychotic symptoms have been under-investigated in Huntington's disease (HD) and research is needed in order to elucidate the characteristics linked to the unique phenotype of HD patients presenting with psychosis. Objective: To evaluate the frequency and factors associated with psychosis in HD. Methods: Cross-sectional study including manifest individuals with HD from the Enroll-HD database. Both conventional statistical analysis (Stepwise Binary Logistic Regression) and five machine learning algorithms [Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO); Elastic Net; Support Vector Machines (SVM); Random Forest; and class-weighted SVM] were used to describe factors associated with psychosis in manifest HD patients. Results: Approximately 11% of patients with HD presented history of psychosis. Logistic regression analysis indicated that younger age at HD clinical diagnosis, lower number of CAG repeats, history of [alcohol use disorders, depression, violent/aggressive behavior and perseverative/obsessive behavior], lower total functional capacity score, and longer time to complete trail making test-B were associated with psychosis. All machine learning algorithms were significant (chi-square p < 0.05) and capable of distinguishing individual HD patients with history of psychosis from those without a history of psychosis with prediction accuracy around 71-73%. The most relevant variables were similar to those found in the conventional analyses. Conclusions: Psychiatric and behavioral symptoms as well as poorer cognitive performance were related to psychosis in HD. In addition, psychosis was associated with lower number of CAG repeats and younger age at clinical diagnosis of HD, suggesting that these patients may represent a unique phenotype in the HD spectrum.",2018,Frontiers in Neurology
A Family of Penalty Functions for Structured Sparsity,"We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. We present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode this prior knowledge by means of a set of constraints on the absolute values of the regression coefficients. This family subsumes the li norm and is flexible enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical and theoretical importance. We establish some important properties of these functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly. Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations highlight the benefit of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our approach over the Lasso and other related methods.",2010,
Nonorthogonal density-matrix perturbation theory.,"Recursive density-matrix perturbation theory [A.M.N. Niklasson and M. Challacombe, Phys. Rev.

Such properties include analytic derivatives of the energy with respect to nuclear displacement, as well as magnetic response computed with a field-dependent basis. The theory is developed in the context of linear scaling purification methods, which are briefly reviewed.",2005,The Journal of chemical physics
Light Manifesto: Non-Philosophy and Meteophilosophy,"Deleuzeâ€™s speculative suggestion on the dark precursor is not a neutral â€œcreativeâ€ cooperation with science that his â€œhybridâ€ projects of geophilosophy, schizoanalysis, and so on, were. The dark precursor is mentioned once in Difference and Repetition as a notion of a â€œvaguely scientificâ€ discipline, and there was no broad or explicit conceptual extension of it in Deleuzeâ€™s further philosophy. But at the same time, this accidental usage of the dark precursor uncovers the deep and fundamental sutures of recent speculative philosophy with the physical investigation of lightning. The fundamental questioning of philosophy, such as Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s speculative movement on â€œhyperchaos,â€ is localized within the meteorological chains of the cosmic order of the principles of lightningâ€™s genesis. In such meteophilosophy,we can find a way to suspend the transcendental limits of logocentrism, in its logo-photo-centric edition proposed by Francois Laruelle. Logo-photo-centric thought constituted by the light manifesto, or by the light as Flash, can be suspended by the anti-manifestational short-circuitsof meteophilosophyâ€™s speculative models. Such short-circuits, from the other side, constitute the core of the lightmaresof thought that did not even come to Laruelle in his non-philosophical dreams.",2019,
LASSO-type estimators for semiparametric nonlinear mixed-effects models estimation,"Parametric nonlinear mixed effects models (NLMEs) are now widely used in biometrical studies, especially in pharmacokinetics research and HIV dynamics models, due to, among other aspects, the computational advances achieved during the last years. However, this kind of models may not be flexible enough for complex longitudinal data analysis. Semiparametric NLMEs (SNMMs) have been proposed as an extension of NLMEs. These models are a good compromise and retain nice features of both parametric and nonparametric models resulting in more flexible models than standard parametric NLMEs. However, SNMMs are complex models for which estimation still remains a challenge. Previous estimation procedures are based on a combination of log-likelihood approximation methods for parametric estimation and smoothing splines techniques for nonparametric estimation. In this work, we propose new estimation strategies in SNMMs. On the one hand, we use the Stochastic Approximation version of EM algorithm (SAEM) to obtain exact ML and REML estimates of the fixed effects and variance components. On the other hand, we propose a LASSO-type method to estimate the unknown nonlinear function. We derive oracle inequalities for this nonparametric estimator. We combine the two approaches in a general estimation procedure that we illustrate with simulations and through the analysis of a real data set of price evolution in on-line auctions.",2014,Statistics and Computing
The Common Folk in the Revolution,"Books written on the Russian revolution, its causes and consequences, fill libraries. We may still learn something new about individual events and people, but it is unlikely that on the basis of untapped archives we are going to find an entirely new interpretation, or a ""golden key"" that would explain all. (The phrase ""golden key,"" of course, comes from the title of S. P. Melgunov's book, in which Melgunov claimed to find that key to Bolshevik success in German money.) Any single book on the history of the Revolution is bound to be a synthetic one, based on the work of many others. Historians have often shown an exaggerated desire to overthrow established orthodoxies, and show up their predecessors as prejudiced, wrong-headed, or at least mistaken. At times such an attitude leads to peculiar results. Surely only the desire to be original can explain the attempt of some American and British scholars to ""prove"" that Stalinist tyranny was not so bad after all, and not as many people died as it has been maintained. In his enormously long and excellent book Orlando Figes does not aim at originality at any price or pretend to find a simple explanation for complex phenomena. He is content to give credit to his predecessors where credit is due, and he usually arrives at middle-of-the-road conclusions, attempting to reconcile conflicting views. His voice is calm, his approach is rational, avoiding the unpersuasive extremes, for example, of either seeing Lenin as an evil genius or depicting him as the hero who would lead the ""class-conscious"" proletariat to victory. Indeed, one of the great merits of this book is what it manages to avoid. Freemasonry, for example, which other historians have seen as a conspiracy that overthrew the tsar and which dominated the Provisional Government in 1917, is mentioned only in two sentences. Nor is Figes interested in contributing to the fruitless and largely meaningless discussions about whether the workers possessed classor trade-union consciousness, or whether the textile workers had more or less class-consciousness than the metal workers. The picture with which the reader comes away from this book is by no means novel or particularly controversial. Prerevolutionary Russia was a backward country with a miserable peasantry on the verge of starvation, a thin veneer of European civilization, and a seemingly unbridgeable gap between the privileged and the unprivileged. The Tsarist regime, which is depicted here in the darkest colors, resisted political changes and therefore did not deserve survival. Figes disagrees with those conservative observers who saw in Stolypin a possible savior. In fact, Stolypin's reforms could not have transformed the country's social and economic system and therefore it is wrong to argue that, had the war not intervened, Russia would have followed a Western path of development. Figes has a very low regard for Nicholas II and describes him as a nonentity who during the last years of his rule surrounded himself with shady characters. It was not an accident that, during the war, cabinets",1998,The Russian Review
A CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH TO ` 0-PENALIZED REGRESSION By,"We propose a constructive approach to estimating sparse, highdimensional linear regression models. The approach is a computational algorithm motivated from the KKT conditions for the `0-penalized least squares solutions. It generates a sequence of solutions iteratively, based on support detection using primal and dual information and root finding. We refer to the algorithm as SDAR for brevity. Under a sparse Riesz condition on the design matrix and certain other conditions, we show that with high probability, the `2 estimation error of the solution sequence decays exponentially to the minimax error bound in O(log(R âˆš J)) iterations, where J is the number of important predictors and R is the relative magnitude of the nonzero target coefficients; and under a mutual coherence condition and certain other conditions, the `âˆž estimation error decays to the optimal error bound in O(log(R)) iterations. Moreover the SDAR solution recovers the oracle least squares estimator within a finite number of iterations with high probability if the sparsity level is known. Computational complexity analysis shows that the cost of SDAR is O(np) per iteration. We also consider an adaptive version of SDAR for use in practical applications where the true sparsity level is unknown. Simulation studies demonstrate that SDAR outperforms Lasso, MCP and two greedy methods in accuracy and efficiency.",2018,
Applications of L1 regularisation,"The lasso algorithm for variable selection in linear models, introduced by Tibshirani, works by imposing an $l_1$~norm bound constraint on the variables in a least squares model and then tuning the model estimation calculation using this bound. This introduction of the bound is interpreted as a form of regularisation step. It leads to a form of quadratic program which is solved by a straight-forward modification of a standard active set algorithm for each value of this bound. Considerable interest was generated by the discovery that the complete solution trajectory parametrised by this bound is piecewise linear and can be calculated very efficiently. Essentially it takes no more work than the solution of either the unconstrained least squares problem or the quadratic program at a single bound value. This has resulted in the study both of the selection problem for different objective and constraint choices and of applications to such areas as data compression and the generation of sparse solutions of very under-determined systems. One important class of generalisation is to quantile regression estimation problems. The original continuation idea extends to these polyhedral objectives in an interesting two phase procedure which involves both the constrained and Lagrangian forms of the problem at each step. However, it is significantly less computationally effective than is the original algorithm for least squares objectives. In contrast, the piecewise linear estimation problem can be solved for each value of the $l_1$~bound by a relatively efficient simplicial descent algorithm, and that this can be used to explore trajectory information in a manner which is at least competitive with the homotopy algorithm in this context. The form of line search used in the descent steps has an important bearing on the effectiveness of the algorithm. A comparison is given between the relative performance of the simplicial descent algorithm used and an interior point method on the piecewise linear estimation problem.

Associations between canopy and understory species increase along a rainshadow gradient in the Alps: habitat heterogeneity or facilitation?,"Spatialassociations among overstory and understory species tend to increase ongradients from wet to dry climates. This shift in the strength of spatialassociations has usually been attributed to shared abiotic requirements betweencanopy species and understory assemblages within communities and/or to anincrease in habitat heterogeneity in dry climates and therefore higher betadiversity. On another hand, more important positive effects of tree canopies onunderstory species in drier climates may also explain stronger associations andhigher beta diversity. We examined these three hypotheses along a strongrainshadow gradient that occurs from the wet external Alps to the dry innerAlpsby analyzing with correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysisthe species composition of 290 relevÃ©s of forests dominated to differentdegrees by Abies alba and Piceaabies.We found important differences in climatic requirements forAbies and Picea, withAbies occurring in warmer and drier habitats thanPicea. The understory species associated with these twospecies showed similar correlations with temperature but not with moisture,withunderstory species of Picea-communities having strongerxeric affinities than understory species ofAbies-communities. We found no significant associationsbetween canopy species and understory composition in the external Alps despitethe fact that Abies and Piceaoccurredin substantially different environments. In contrast,Abiesand Picea occurred in more similar environments in theinner Alps, but the understory assemblages associated with eitherAbies or Picea were significantlydifferent. This increase in canopy-understory associations was in partdetermined by strong differences in moisture between southern and northernaspects in the inner Alps, which affected both canopy and understory speciesdistributions. However, differences between the canopy effects ofPicea and Abies also appeared tocontribute to stronger associations between canopy and understory species, andconsequently to increase beta diversity. This pattern only occurred on southernaspects of the inner Alps but was highly significant. Our results suggest thatspecies distributions may be continuous on the wet ends of moisture gradientsbut discrete on dry ends. Relatively discrete communities at stressful ends ofgradients appear to develop as a result of both habitat differentiation and thepositive effects of overstory species.",2004,Plant Ecology
"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 drug resistance in a sub-set of mothers and their infants receiving antiretroviral treatment in Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso","The emergence of HIV-1 drug resistance (HIVDR) is a public health problem that affects women and children. Local data of HIVDR is critical to improving their care and treatment. So, we investigated HIVDR in mothers and infants receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) at Saint Camille Hospital of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. This study included 50 mothers and 50 infants on ART. CD4 and HIV-1 viral load were determined using FACSCount and Abbott m2000rt respectively. HIVDR was determined in patients with virologic failure using ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System kit on the 3130 Genetic Analyzer. The median age was 37.28 years in mothers and 1.58 year in infants. Sequencing of samples showed subtypes CRF02_AG (55.56%), CRF06_cpx (33.33%) and G (11.11%). M184V was the most frequent and was associated with highlevel resistance to 3TC, FTC, and ABC. Other mutations such as T215F/Y, D67N/E, K70R, and K219Q were associated with intermediate resistance to TDF, AZT, and 3TC. No mutation to LPV/r was detected among mothers and infants. The findings of HIVDR in some mothers and infants suggested the change of treatment for these persons. Introduction In 2015, the number of people living with HIV-1 worldwide was estimated at 36.7 million.1 In Sub-Saharan Africa, it is still estimated that 620 000 new HIV-1 infections occurred in 2015.1 The number of pregnant women infected with HIV in Africa in 2013 was estimated at 1.3 million.2 Despite the 40% reduction of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 in the past five years, news pediatrics infections were estimated at 220 000 in 2014 and the majority were through MTCT.3 In recent years, the hope of controlling the epidemic of HIV-1 is being thwarted by the emergence of HIV-1 drug resistance (HIVDR) to various antiretroviral (ARV) used for the treatment of HIV-1 infected patients. Factors leading to HIVDR may be related to the virus, HIV1 infected persons, and the ARV drugs or to prevention program.4 Emergence of HIVDR remains a major obstacle to the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART).5 Previous studies have shown that the prevalence of HIVDR in Burkina Faso was 12.5% in patients with virologic failure in 2009 in Ouagadougou 6 and 20.4% in patients on HAART in 2011 in BoboDioulasso and Ouagadougou.7 Pregnant women harboring HIVDR might transmit these strains to their infants.8 Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) reduces the risk of pediatric HIV-1 infection but does not completely prevent the transmission.9-11 In addition, HIV-1 infected children in the frame of PMTCT can develop resistance to ARV administered.12 Acquired HIVDR occurs due to incomplete suppression of viral replication during the administration of antiretroviral drugs to infants or by ingestion of maternal drugs through breast milk.13 Thus, in the course of PMTCT, it is possible that mothers and their infants acquire HIVDR to ARV drugs used. Describing treatment failure and drug resistance in both mother and infant in PMTCT programs is highly relevant in a context where the pediatric formula of ARV is still limited. So, the objective of this study is to describe the HIVDR in mothers and their infants receiving ART for their best care in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Materials and Methods Population study and collection of blood samples It is a cross-sectional study that included 50 HIV-1 infected mother-child pairs followed up in PMTCT program at Saint Camille Hospital of Ouagadougou from August 2014 to December 2015. Blood sampling was done in mothers one year after delivery and in infants at 12 months after ART initiation for determination of clinical, immunological and virologic parameters. Whole Blood was collected in EDTA tubes and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes. The plasma was collected into cryotubes and stored at -20Â°C until biological analysis.

Lasso and Sparsity in Statistics,"In this chapter, I discuss the lasso and sparsity, in the area of supervised learning that has been the focus of my research and that of many other statisticians. This area can be described as follows. Many statistical problems involve modeling important variables or outcomes as functions of predictor variables. One objective is to produce models that allow predictions of outcomes that are as accurate as possible. Another is to develop an understanding of which variables in a set of potential predictors are strongly related to the outcome variable. For example, the outcome of interest might be the price of a companyâ€™s stock in a weekâ€™s time, and potential predictor variables might include information about the company, the sector of the economy it operates in, recent fluctuations in the stockâ€™s price, and other economic factors. With technological development and the advent of huge amounts of data, we are frequently faced with very large numbers of potential predictor variables.",2014,
Analysis of a PAH-degrading bacterial population in subsurface sediments on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,"Abstract Little is known about the types and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) existing in the deep-sea subsurface environment, which is believed to be cold, oligothrophic and of high static pressure. PAHs in the upper layers of the water column are unavoidably subjected to degradation while they are deposited to the sea floor and become embedded in the deep-sea sediment. In this report, a high concentration of PAHs was discovered in the sediment 2.7Â m beneath the bottom surface at a water depth of 3962Â m on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). The total concentration of PAHs was 445Â ng (g dry wt sediment) -1 . Among the seven detected PAHs, the concentrations of phenanthrene (222Â ngÂ g -1 ) and fluorene (79Â ngÂ g -1 ) were relatively high. In addition, PAH-degrading bacteria were found within the sediments. As in a previously detected site on the MAR, in the PAH-enriched region of this site, a bacterium of the genus Cycloclasticus was found to be the predominant isolate detected by PCR-DGGE analysis. In addition, bacteria of the Halomonas , Marinobacter , Alcanivorax , Thalassospira and Maricaulis genera, were also included in the PAH-degrading community. In summary, a high concentration of PAHs was detected in the subsurface of the deep-sea sediment, and once again, the Cycloclasticus bacterium was confirmed to be a ubiquitous marine PAH degrader even in the subsurface marine environment. Considering the abundance of PAHs therein, biodegradation is thus thought to be inactive, probably because of the low temperature, limited oxygen and/or limited nutrients.",2010,
Bentonite as a Colloid Source in Groundwaters at Olkiluoto,"In this work bentonite was studied as a potential source of colloids in Olkiluoto groundwaters. Samples were collected at two groundwater stations, PVA1 at 37.5m dept and PVA3 at 95.6m depth, in the VLJ-tunnel. The deeper groundwater at PVA3 was more saline (2.6g/L of Cl) than the shallow at PVA1 (0.8g/L of Cl). A bentonite source had been assembled at each groundwater station so that two sample lines were available for water samples; one for collecting a sample before and the other for collecting a sample after interaction with bentonite. Before starting the actual colloid sampling groundwaters from both sample lines at both stations were analysed. Only minor alterations, mostly within the uncertainty limits of the analysis methods, were brought about in the water chemistries after interaction with the bentonite sources. The only clear changes were seen in the concentration of iron which decreased after interaction with bentonite in the groundwaters at both stations. After groundwater sampling the actual colloid sampling was performed. The water samples were collected and treated inside a movable nitrogen filled glove-box. The samples could be collected from each sampling line directly in the glove-box via two quick-couplings that had been assembled on the front face of the box. The sample lines had been assembled with 0.45Î¼m filters before entering the glove-box, because only colloids smaller than 0.45Î¼m were of interest, as they are not prone to sedimentation in slow groundwater flows and therefore could act as potential radionuclide carriers. Colloid samples were collected and treated similarly from both sampling lines at both groundwater stations. For estimating the colloid content the groundwater samples were filtered with centrifugal ultrafiltration tubes of different cut-off values (0.3Î¼m, 300kD and 10kD). The ultrafiltrations produced the colloid-containing concentrate fractions and the soluble substances-containing filtrate fractions. In addition to the ultrafiltrations some Nuclepore filter membranes with different cut-off values (0.4Î¼m, 0.2Î¼m, 0.1Î¼m and 0.05Î¼m) were prepared for SEM/EDS examination. The results of the groundwater samples collected before interaction with bentonite indicated that iron and aluminium were also associated with colloidal species, for example with SiO2, clay mineral or/and calcite colloids. The estimated size range of the colloids was from 50nm up to 400nm in PVA1 and in the more saline PVA3 up to 300nm (SEM). The estimate of Fe-associated colloids in PVA1 was 0.8mg/L and Alassociated colloids 0.004mg/L, whereas, in PVA3 the corresponding concentrations were clearly lower, 0.07mg/L and 0.001mg/L, respectively. After bentonite interaction bentonite colloids were detected (EDS) only in PVA1 groundwater. The size of the colloids varied from about 50nm up to about 200nm (SEM). However, the upper size limit was difficult to estimate due to large aggregates. No clear indication of bentonite colloids was obtained in PVA3 samples, but the element composition (EDS) indicated that minor amounts could be present. In PVA1 the estimated amount of Fe-associated colloids was 0.4mg/L and the amount of Alassociated colloids was 0.001mg/L, whereas, in PVA3 the contents were 0.06mg/L and 0.001mg/L, respectively. Overall, the estimated concentrations of colloids in the studied size range (<0.45Î¼m) were small in both groundwaters and interaction with bentonite somewhat decreased the amount of Feand Al-associated colloids. However, the decrease in the colloid amount was more prominent in the case of the fresh PVA1 groundwater, which contained a little more to begin with. The salinity of groundwater affected the amount of colloids; more saline less colloids. Bentonite colloids released from the bentonite source were detected only in the fresh PVA1 groundwater, but the amount was too small for obtaining an assessment of the concentration.",2006,
HRI Interface Usability Evaluation of Camera Placement and View for a Tele-operated Agricultural Sprayer Robot,"Current autonomous robots face efficiency and effectiveness limits when dealing with agricultural tasks due to the unpredictable and unstructured field environment. Teleoperation, i.e. directing without collocation by the farmer, could overcome these limits. This requires the design of an interface for effective and efficient human-robot collaboration. Several principles to ensure usability, guide the design of this interface. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: it reports the practical feasibility of agri-robot teleoperation as demonstrated during 2013 in Cyprus through a vineyard sprayer robot, tested extensively in open fields and greenhouses; and it reports measurements of the human robot interface. The functionality implemented allowed robot navigation and target (grape) spraying. The interface was developed following the LASSO technique and design guidelines of robot teleoperation, collected through an extensive literature review in the fields of Human-Robot Interaction and Human-Computer Interaction. During development it was tested and formatively evaluated at a special usability lab at the Hellenic Open University. The teleoperated agrirobot sprayer was implemented on a Summit XL robotic platform (Robotnik). The usability of the system was investigated by thirty farmers, technicians, and agricultural engineers who were asked to use different teleoperation interaction modes in order to navigate the robot along vineyard rows and spray grape clusters. Specifically we examined the case of tele-operating the robot using one camera (exchangeable views) versus three cameras (path view, peripheral view, and target view, all on one window). Participantsâ€™ interaction with the system was monitored and objective metrics of the effectiveness and efficiency of the human-robot collaboration were collected, such as the total number of sprayed vines and the overall time required. Participants completed a questionnaire related to their experience with the system in each interaction mode. Statistical analyses of the collected data were conducted in order to compare the different interaction modes.",2016,

From Mineralogy to Petrography: Study on the Applicability of Machine Learning,"This thesis aims to understand if it is possible to apply machine learning techniques to predict the petrographical composition of a sample of soil given its mineralogical structure. The problem formalization requires predicting, from a set of continuous attributes (mineralogical constitution), a set of continuous features (petrographical constitution). The soil samples we have at disposal, for which both mineralogical and petrographical composition are known, present two challenges: their limited quantity and the non-uniform distribution of values of their features. These distributions are gaussian or exponential. We have addressed the prediction task with both regression and classification techniques. In the second case, we have discretized petrographical attributes using a custom methodology. These procedure maps the continuous domain of the feature into a discrete one represented by intervals of values. We have used these intervals as class labels. This allows classifying a sample by indicating its possible range of values. We applied Linear, Lasso, Ridge and Support Vector Machine (SVR) as regression techniques. The classification method used is the Decision Tree. Each attribute prediction is treated as a disjointed problem: all mineralogical attributes are used to predict one petrographical feature. Furthermore, we tested a custom third approach exploiting Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) technique, which jointly forecasts all petrographical features using all mineralogical attributes. This custom methodology is considered as a regression for what concerns performances evaluation. We have designed a way to evaluate the ability of regression models to predict rare values: it consists of two visual metrics called regression-precision and regression-recall inspired by precision and recall classification metrics. In order to compare regression and classifications predictions, we discretized continuous outcomes of regression techniques using the same intervals adopted for classification labels. After this operation, we confront predictions through metrics proper of classification: precision, recall and F-measure. Results show that models perform better on exponentially distributed petrographical attributes. Linear, Lasso and Ridge regressions are more promising than Decision Tree. NMF and SVR behave the worst. In the future we will focus on the possibility to exploit some relations that partially link petrographical composition with mineralogical one, with the help of a domain expert, trying in such a way to fulfill with domain knowledge the lack of data. However, although we still have not achieved final results, our preliminary analysis reveal that there is the possibility to successfully apply regression techniques for this kind of soil analysis.",2018,
Estimating High-Dimensional Time Series Models,"We study the asymptotic properties of the Adaptive LASSO (adaLASSO) in sparse, high-dimensional, linear time-series models. We assume both the number of covariates in the model and candidate variables can increase with the number of observations and the number of candidate variables is, possibly, larger than the number of observations. We show the adaLASSO consistently chooses the relevant variables as the number of observations increases (model selection consistency), and has the oracle property, even when the errors are non-Gaussian and conditionally heteroskedastic. A simulation study shows the method performs well in very general settings. Finally, we consider two applications: in the first one the goal is to forecast quarterly US inflation one-step ahead, and in the second we are interested in the excess return of the S&P 500 index. The method used outperforms the usual benchmarks in the literature.",2012,
A Partial Least Squares based algorithm for parsimonious variable selection,"BackgroundIn genomics, a commonly encountered problem is to extract a subset of variables out of a large set of explanatory variables associated with one or several quantitative or qualitative response variables. An example is to identify associations between codon-usage and phylogeny based definitions of taxonomic groups at different taxonomic levels. Maximum understandability with the smallest number of selected variables, consistency of the selected variables, as well as variation of model performance on test data, are issues to be addressed for such problems.ResultsWe present an algorithm balancing the parsimony and the predictive performance of a model. The algorithm is based on variable selection using reduced-rank Partial Least Squares with a regularized elimination. Allowing a marginal decrease in model performance results in a substantial decrease in the number of selected variables. This significantly improves the understandability of the model. Within the approach we have tested and compared three different criteria commonly used in the Partial Least Square modeling paradigm for variable selection; loading weights, regression coefficients and variable importance on projections. The algorithm is applied to a problem of identifying codon variations discriminating different bacterial taxa, which is of particular interest in classifying metagenomics samples. The results are compared with a classical forward selection algorithm, the much used Lasso algorithm as well as Soft-threshold Partial Least Squares variable selection.ConclusionsA regularized elimination algorithm based on Partial Least Squares produces results that increase understandability and consistency and reduces the classification error on test data compared to standard approaches.",2011,Algorithms for Molecular Biology : AMB
Combinatorial selection and least absolute shrinkage via the Clash algorithm,"The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for linear regression exploits the geometric interplay of the â„“2-data error objective and the â„“1-norm constraint to arbitrarily select sparse models. Guiding this uninformed selection process with sparsity models has been precisely the center of attention over the last decade in order to improve learning performance. To this end, we alter the selection process of LASSO to explicitly leverage combinatorial sparsity models (CSMs) via the combinatorial selection and least absolute shrinkage (Clash) operator. We provide concrete guidelines how to leverage combinatorial constraints within Clash, and characterize CLASH's guarantees as a function of the set restricted isometry constants of the sensing matrix. Finally, our experimental results show that Clash can outperform both LASSO and model-based compressive sensing in sparse estimation.",2012,2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings
An Efficient Frequency Recognition Method Based on Likelihood Ratio Test for SSVEP-Based BCI,"An efficient frequency recognition method is very important for SSVEP-based BCI systems to improve the information transfer rate (ITR). To address this aspect, for the first time, likelihood ratio test (LRT) was utilized to propose a novel multichannel frequency recognition method for SSVEP data. The essence of this new method is to calculate the association between multichannel EEG signals and the reference signals which were constructed according to the stimulus frequency with LRT. For the simulation and real SSVEP data, the proposed method yielded higher recognition accuracy with shorter time window length and was more robust against noise in comparison with the popular canonical correlation analysis- (CCA-) based method and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator- (LASSO-) based method. The recognition accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR) obtained by the proposed method was higher than those of the CCA-based method and LASSO-based method. The superior results indicate that the LRT method is a promising candidate for reliable frequency recognition in future SSVEP-BCI.",2014,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine
"25 years of the UK EIA System: Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats","Abstract This paper offers a review of the UK EIA system, providing insights into its evolution and reflecting on perceptions of effectiveness of the EIA system. The work adopts a similar approach used by Glasson in 1999, where he provided a review of the first 10Â years of EIA in the UK, complimented by a SWOT analysis. In conducting the SWOT analysis, the authors make use of (1) a UK EIA survey which was conducted in 2011; (2) an interactive session organised at a 2013 workshop at the University of Liverpool on 25Â years of the EU EIA Directive; and (3) a systematic literature review of publications since 1999. The results indicate that the internal factors (i.e. strengths and weaknesses) of the EIA system have not actually changed much in the last 15Â years. Changes are more apparent for the external factors, especially with regards to opportunities. However, EIA may be suffering from a mid-life crisis at this point and a lot may be owing to perceptions towards EIA which may be influenced and inversely related to the length of experience in EIA.

Multipath Mitigation in GNSS Positioning by the Dual-Path Compression Estimation,"The combinations of triple-frequency carrier phase have been widely used for precise positioning in the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). However, the position accuracy of this system is negatively affected by multipath (MP) interference and highly kinematic problems. To bridge this gap, in this paper, a dual-path compression estimation algorithm based on generalized least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method with penalty terms is proposed to mitigate MP. We establish a linear observation model, taking into account triple-frequency carrier phase and Doppler shift. In order to improve the accuracy of the compression estimation, a small penalty term is added after the re-weighted L1 regularization. Accordingly, the linear observation model is transformed into the MP estimation model, with the weight matrix consisting of the carrier-to-noise ratio function and satellite elevation. We use the dual-path algorithm to solve the LASSO problem in the MP estimation model. QR decomposition and the specialized implementation strategy are applied to improve the dual-path LASSO with penalty (DPLP) algorithm. The results on real-world dataset show that the sparse estimation method proposed in this study can effectively reduce the carrier phase MP errors at triple-frequency so long as the number of MP-affected satellites is less than five (the visible satellites is eight-ten).",2020,IEEE Sensors Journal
Selection of components and degrees of smoothing via lasso in high dimensional nonparametric additive models,"This paper proposes a procedure for selecting components and degrees of smoothing in high dimensional nonparametric additive models. In the procedure, different components have different penalties, and all the smoothing parameters in one component have the same penalties. The idea is similar to, but in fact different from, Wang et al.'s [Wang, H., Li, G.D., Tsai, C.L., 2007. Regression coefficient and autoregressive order shrinkage and selection via the lasso. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 69, 63-78] modified lasso, which requires different penalties for different parameters. The procedure obtains the sequence of components according to the importance of these components by Efron et al.'s [Efron, B., Hastie, T., Johnstone, I., Tibshirani, R., 2004. Least angle regression. Annals of Statistics 32, 407-489] LARS. CV or BIC selector can be used to select the tuning parameters in the procedure, where some asymptotic properties are proved. Some simulation results and two examples are used to illustrate the procedure.",2008,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Landscape changes caused by high altitude ski-pistes affect bird species richness and distribution in the Alps,"Abstract There is a paucity of research on the wider landscape-level effects of ski-piste construction on alpine fauna. In this study, the response of alpine bird communities to the landscape changes induced by the construction of ski-pistes was investigated in the western Italian Alps. The aims were: (i) to test the hypothesis that ski-pistes have a detrimental effect on alpine grassland bird communities at a landscape-scale; and, (ii) to model local probability distributions of bird species according to different scenarios of ski-piste restoration and ski-piste proliferation above the treeline. Species richness and presence/absence data from point counts were analyzed in relation to GIS-derived landscape variables based on a 16Â ha hexagon grid. Predictive variables were selected through the LASSO model selection procedure, and logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of occurrence of each species in each hexagon. Grassland species richness, and probability of occurrence of water pipit, wheatear and black redstart, significantly decreased with increasing extent of ski-piste edge. Length of ski-piste edge was in the set of best models considering a large range of habitat and landscape predictors, and are therefore clearly features that exert a strong negative effect on high alpine grassland bird communities. Predictions of species occurrence were made by applying the models to different scenarios of habitat change. These showed predicted detrimental impacts of a relatively small 10% increase in ski-piste extent, but also that grassland restoration on existing ski-pistes could result in significantly increased occurrence rates of alpine grassland species. This study suggests that ski-pistes are perceived by birds as detrimental features of the alpine landscape. To minimize their impact, new, environmentallyâ€“friendly ways of constructing pistes should be developed, which could include habitat restoration and management to obtain a level of grass cover such that edges of ski-pistes are no longer perceived by birds.",2011,Biological Conservation
Acquisition of detailed models for virtual reality,"More and more archaeological sites are being reconstructed in virtual reality. The problem remains the huge effort that has to be made to obtain realistic models. Besides on-site measurements, much time is often spent in manually rebuilding the whole site with a CAD package or a 3D-modelling tool. This limits the tractable complexity. In this paper two flexible automatic 3D surface acquisition systems are used to â€œvirtualiseâ€ archaeological sites. The Roman site of Sagalassos (Southwest Turkey) is used as a test case to illustrate the potential of these new approaches. Besides the construction of a virtual site consisting of different level of details, some more applications to archaeology and conservation of heritage sites are presented.",2000,
Negative Binomial Modelling and Applications for Microbiome Count Data,"The human microbiome plays an important role in human health and disease. Identification of factors that affect the microbiome composition will eventually allow modulation of the microbiome for therapeutic purposes. The aim of this study is to find a suitable statistics distribution model for the set of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which are used to categorize bacteria based on sequence similarity, and to use these models to analyze the supra-gingival and sub-gingival plaque microbiome. We model the OTU data with a Negative Binomial (NB) distribution and fit the maximum-likelihood estimates for the NB model parameters. We then develop a gamma-prior distribution to model the underlying composition of each OTU. We use the mean of the calculated posterior distribution as an estimator of the underlying composition of each OTU, analyzing oral cavity microbiome communities based on the posterior means. Likelihood ratio tests identified NB models for some OTUs that differed significantly between sub-gingival plaques and supra-gingival plaques. We also developed a NÃ¤Ä±ve Bayes Discriminant Analysis (NBDA) approach based on the calculated NB distributions, and performed LASSO regression on the simple proportions and the estimated underlying compositions. The NBDA and LASSO approaches identified OTUs that play a critical role in classification. By replacing simple proportions with distribution models, we explore the underlying composition of OTUs better without losing too much discriminant information.",2016,
Person's discriminating visual features for recognising gender: LASSO regression model and feature analysis,"Gender is one of the demographic attributes of a person, which is considered as a soft trait in the area of biometric. Several studies have been conducted to extract gender information based on a person's face image, gait pattern, fingerprint, iris, speech and hand geometry. In this paper, we concentrate on predicting gender using a person's image aesthetic, which has never been studied before. We propose a visual preference model for discriminating males from females using LASSO regression. The preference model uses 57 dimensional feature vector containing 14 different perceptual image features. The model is evaluated on a database of 34,000 images from 170 Flickr users (110 males and 60 females). Results show that maximum and average accuracy of predicting gender are around 91.67% and 84.38%, respectively, on 100 random sampling of training and testing datasets. The proposed method outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we also address two important research questions: which f...",2017,IJBM
Comprehensive analysis of a ceRNA network reveals potential prognostic cytoplasmic lncRNAs involved in HCC progression,"The aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has drawn increasing attention in the field of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biology. In the present study, we obtained the expression profiles of lncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in 371 HCC tissues and 50 normal tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified hepatocarcinogenesis-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs, log fold changeâ€‰â‰¥â€‰2, FDR < 0.01), including 753 lncRNAs, 97 miRNAs, and 1,535 mRNAs. Because the specific functions of lncRNAs are closely related to their intracellular localizations and because the cytoplasm is the main location for competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) action, we analyzed not only the interactions among these DEGs but also the distributions of lncRNAs (cytoplasmic, nuclear or both). Then, an HCC-associated deregulated ceRNA network consisting of 37 lncRNAs, 10 miRNAs, and 26 mRNAs was constructed after excluding those lncRNAs located only in the nucleus. Survival analysis of this network demonstrated that 15 lncRNAs, 3 miRNAs, and 16 mRNAs were significantly correlated with the overall survival of HCC patients (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). Through multivariate Cox regression and lasso analysis, a risk score system based on 13 lncRNAs was constructed, which showed good discrimination and predictive ability for HCC patient survival time. This ceRNA network-construction approach, based on lncRNA distribution, not only narrowed the scope of target lncRNAs but also provided specific candidate molecular biomarkers for evaluating the prognosis of HCC, which will help expand our understanding of the ceRNA mechanisms involved in the early development of HCC.",2019,Journal of Cellular Physiology
First record of an hypopus (Acari: Hypoderatidae) from a jaeger (Aves: Charadriiformes: Stercorariidae).,"Thalassornectes (Alcidectes) aukletae, originally described from two species of auklets (Charadriiformes: Alcidae) from maritime eastern Russia, is reported from a third species of pelagic charadriiform (Stercorariidae), the pomarine jaeger, Stercorarius pomarinus (Temminck), from Florida. The specimens from the jaeger are slightly smaller, the genital apodeme is more heavily sclerotized, paired setae gm are twice as long and there are other minor variations in the idiosomal and leg chaetotaxy. These differences are not considered sufficient to warrant taxonomic separation at the species or subspecies level from the nominate species T. (A.) aukletae. The same hypopus occurring across different families of birds is unusual in the Hypoderatidae. The diversity in hosts from several orders of birds, low intensities of infection in the two species from Africa, low prevalences in alcids from Russia, and rarity of these hypoderatids in all surveyed hosts leads us to speculate that the true host affinities of species in the genus Thalassornectes are unknown. The alternative consideration is that these are simply uncommon species that are very host specific.",1995,Journal of medical entomology
Integrative approach for inference of gene regulatory networks using lasso-based random featuring and application to Psychiatric disorders,"Inferring gene regulatory networks is one of the most interesting research areas in the systems biology. Many inference methods have been developed by using a variety of computational models and approaches. In this paper, we propose two network inference methods based on a lasso-based random feature selection algorithm (LARF). There are three main contributions. First, our z score-based method to measure gene expression variations from knockout data is more effective than similar criteria of related works. Second, we confirmed that the true regulator selection can be effectively improved by LARF. Lastly, we verified that an integrative approach can clearly outperform a single method when two different methods are effectively jointed. In the experiments, our method outperformed state of the art methods on simulated data, and LARF also was applied to the inference of gene regulatory networks associated with Psychiatric disorders.",2015,
Sparse identification for nonlinear optical communication systems: SINO method.,"We introduce low complexity machine learning method method (based on lasso regression, which promotes sparsity, to identify the interaction between symbols in different time slots and to select the minimum number relevant perturbation terms that are employed) for nonlinearity mitigation. The immense intricacy of the problem calls for the development of ""smart"" methodology, simplifying the analysis without losing the key features that are important for recovery of transmitted data. The proposed sparse identification method for optical systems (SINO) allows to determine the minimal (optimal) number of degrees of freedom required for adaptive mitigation of detrimental nonlinear effects. We demonstrate successful application of the SINO method both for standard fiber communication links (over 3 dB gain) and for few-mode spatial-division-multiplexing systems.",2016,Optics express
Health conditions associated with aging and end of life of adults with Down syndrome.,"Expectations for the life course of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have changed, with life expectancy estimates increasing from 12 in 1949 to nearly 60 years of age today (Bittles & Glasson, 2004; Penrose, 1949). Along with this longer life expectancy comes a larger population of adults with DS who display premature age-related changes in their health. There is thus a need to provide specialized health care to this aging population of adults with DS who are at high risk for some conditions and at lower risk for others. This review focuses on the rates and contributing factors to medical conditions that are common in adults with DS or that show changes with age. The review of medical conditions includes the increased risk for skin and hair changes, early onset menopause, visual and hearing impairments, adult onset seizure disorder, thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea and musculoskeletal problems. The different pattern of conditions associated with the mortality of adults with DS is also reviewed.",2010,International review of research in mental retardation
Practical Stability of Synchronized Chaotic Attractors and its Control,"AbstractWe discussed the application of the concept of practical stability to chaotic synchronizedattractors located at the invariant subspaces. Additionally, we present the controlling methodwhich allows enlarging the practical stability regions. 1 Introduction One of the fundamental problems in practical applications of chaotic dynamics is the problemof stability of chaotic attractor A. e.g., chaos synchronization (Fujisaka and Yamada, 1983;Afraimovich et al., 1986; Pecora and Carroll, 1990; Anishchenko et al., 1991; Lai and Grebogi,1993; Kapitaniak, 1994; Carroll, 1995; Chen, 1996; Carroll et al., 1996; Kapitaniaak, 1996).The basin of attraction (A) is the set of points whose ! -limit set is contained in A. InMilnorâ€™s de nition (Milnor, 1985) of an attractor the basin of attraction need not include thewhole neighborhood of the attractor, i.e., we say that A is a Milnor attractor if (A) haspositive Lebesgue measure. For example, riddled basins (Alexander et al., 1992; Ott et al.,1994; Heagy et al., 1996; Kapitaniak, 1995; Kapitaniak and Chua, 1996) which have recentlybeen found in practical physical systems (they usually occur in the systems with a simple classof symmetry like most of the chaos synchronization procedures (Heagy et al., 1996; Kapitaniak,1995; Kapitaniak and Chua, 1996), have positive Lebesgue measure but do not contain anyneighborhood of the attractor. If the basin of attraction contains the neighborhood of A, thenattractor is asymptotically stable.Most of the chaotic attractors which can be met in the practical engineering systems arequasiattractors, i.e., the limiting sets enclosing the periodic orbits of di erent topological types,structurally unstable homoclinic trajectories, etc. Practical systems are mainly quasihyperbolic,i.e., many di erent types of attractors co-exist in the phase space.",1999,
Co-morbid obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression: a Bayesian network approach.,"BACKGROUND
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is often co-morbid with depression. Using the methods of network analysis, we computed two networks that disclose the potentially causal relationships among symptoms of these two disorders in 408 adult patients with primary OCD and co-morbid depression symptoms.


METHOD
We examined the relationship between the symptoms constituting these syndromes by computing a (regularized) partial correlation network via the graphical LASSO procedure, and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) via a Bayesian hill-climbing algorithm.


RESULTS
The results suggest that the degree of interference and distress associated with obsessions, and the degree of interference associated with compulsions, are the chief drivers of co-morbidity. Moreover, activation of the depression cluster appears to occur solely through distress associated with obsessions activating sadness - a key symptom that 'bridges' the two syndromic clusters in the DAG.


CONCLUSIONS
Bayesian analysis can expand the repertoire of network analytic approaches to psychopathology. We discuss clinical implications and limitations of our findings.",2017,Psychological medicine
Bistable adhesion behavior of an anisotropic particle on a sliding polymer brush.,"Bistable adhesion behavior of an anisotropic particle adsorbed on a sliding polymer brush was found by a single chain in mean field theory (SCMFT) study. Adjacent to the normal adhesion state at which the entropy is depressed, an additional abnormal adhesion state appears. The numerical results demonstrate that the physical mechanism of the bistable adhesion behavior is from the cooperation of the reptation motion of the sliding polymers and the rotating motion of the anisotropic particle. In the abnormal adhesion state, the orientational entropy of the anisotropic particle dominates the adhesion behavior, although the translational entropy is depressed. This bistable adhesion behavior works like a lasso rope in that the abnormal state provides a wide, sensitive, and responsive range, and the normal state furnishes stable adhesion depending on the particle anisotropy.",2019,Soft matter
Multiple Regression Methods Show Great Potential for Rare Variant Association Tests,"The investigation of associations between rare genetic variants and diseases or phenotypes has two goals. Firstly, the identification of which genes or genomic regions are associated, and secondly, discrimination of associated variants from background noise within each region. Over the last few years, many new methods have been developed which associate genomic regions with phenotypes. However, classical methods for high-dimensional data have received little attention. Here we investigate whether several classical statistical methods for high-dimensional data: ridge regression (RR), principal components regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLS), a sparse version of PLS (SPLS), and the LASSO are able to detect associations with rare genetic variants. These approaches have been extensively used in statistics to identify the true associations in data sets containing many predictor variables. Using genetic variants identified in three genes that were Sanger sequenced in 1998 individuals, we simulated continuous phenotypes under several different models, and we show that these feature selection and feature extraction methods can substantially outperform several popular methods for rare variant analysis. Furthermore, these approaches can identify which variants are contributing most to the model fit, and therefore both goals of rare variant analysis can be achieved simultaneously with the use of regression regularization methods. These methods are briefly illustrated with an analysis of adiponectin levels and variants in the ADIPOQ gene.",2012,PLoS ONE
"Enrichment and isolation of acid-tolerant sulfate-reducing microorganisms in the anoxic, acidic hot spring sediments from Copahue volcano, Argentina.","The geothermal Copahue-Caviahue (GCC) system (Argentina) is an extreme acidic environment, dominated by the activity of the Copahue volcano. Environments characterized by low pH values, such as volcanic areas, are of particular interest for the search of acidophilic microorganisms with application in biotechnological processes. In this work, sulfate-reducing microorganisms were investigated in geothermal acidic, anaerobic zones from GCC system. Sediment samples from Agua del LimÃ³n (AL1), Las MÃ¡quinas (LMa2), Las Maquinitas (LMi) and BaÃ±o 9 (B9-2, B9-3) were found to be acidic (pH values 2.1-3.0) to moderate acidic (5.1-5.2), containing small TOC values, and ferric iron precipitates. The organic electron donor added to the enrichments was completely oxidized to CO2. Bacteria related to 'Desulfobacillus acidavidus' strain CL4 were found to be dominant (67-83% of the total number of clones) in the enrichment cultures, and their presence was confirmed by their isolation on overlay plates. Other bacteria were also detected with lower abundance (6-20% of the total number of clones), with representatives of the genera Acidithiobacillus, Sulfobacillus, Alicyclobacillus and Athalassotoga/Mesoaciditoga. These enrichments and isolates found at low pH confirm the presence of anaerobic activities in the acidic sediments from the geothermal Copahue-Caviahue system.",2019,FEMS microbiology ecology
Technical Report on Semiautomatic Segmentation Using the Adobe Photoshop,"The purpose of this research is to enable users to semiautomatically segment the anatomical structures in magnetic resonance images (MRIs), computerized tomographs (CTs), and other medical images on a personal computer. The segmented images are used for making 3D images, which are helpful to medical education and research. To achieve this purpose, the following trials were performed. The entire body of a volunteer was scanned to make 557 MRIs. On Adobe Photoshop, contours of 19 anatomical structures in the MRIs were semiautomatically drawn using MAGNETIC LASSO TOOL and manually corrected using either LASSO TOOL or DIRECT SELECTION TOOL to make 557 segmented images. In a similar manner, 13 anatomical structures in 8,590 anatomical images were segmented. Proper segmentation was verified by making 3D images from the segmented images. Semiautomatic segmentation using Adobe Photoshop is expected to be widely used for segmentation of anatomical structures in various medical images.",2005,Journal of Digital Imaging
Naive Feature Selection: Sparsity in Naive Bayes,"Due to its linear complexity, naive Bayes classification remains an attractive supervised learning method, especially in very large-scale settings. We propose a sparse version of naive Bayes, which can be used for feature selection. This leads to a combinatorial maximum-likelihood problem, for which we provide an exact solution in the case of binary data, or a bound in the multinomial case. We prove that our bound becomes tight as the marginal contribution of additional features decreases. Both binary and multinomial sparse models are solvable in time almost linear in problem size, representing a very small extra relative cost compared to the classical naive Bayes. Numerical experiments on text data show that the naive Bayes feature selection method is as statistically effective as state-of-the-art feature selection methods such as recursive feature elimination, $l_1$-penalized logistic regression and LASSO, while being orders of magnitude faster. For a large data set, having more than with $1.6$ million training points and about $12$ million features, and with a non-optimized CPU implementation, our sparse naive Bayes model can be trained in less than 15 seconds.",2019,ArXiv
"Thalassobacillus cyri sp. nov., a moderately halophilic Gram-positive bacterium from a hypersaline lake.","A Gram-positive, moderately halophilic bacterium, designated strain HS286(T), was isolated from water of the hypersaline Lake Howz-Soltan in Iran. Cells were strictly aerobic, rod-shaped, motile and able to produce ellipsoidal endospores at a central-subterminal position in swollen sporangia. Isolate HS286(T) grew in a complex medium supplemented with 1-15 % (w/v) NaCl, with optimum growth at 8.0 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons showed that strain HS286(T) was closely related to Thalassobacillus devorans G-19.1(T) (99.4 % gene sequence similarity). The other closest species were Halobacillus yeomjeoni MSS-402(T) (96.9 %) and other species of the genus Halobacillus (with 96.7-93.5 % similarity). Strain HS286(T) had cell-wall peptidoglycan based on meso-diaminopimelic acid and MK-7 as the respiratory isoprenoid quinone. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0) (43.8 %), iso-C(16 : 0) (21.4 %), iso-C(14 : 0) (9.4 %), anteiso-C(17 : 0) (8.7 %) and iso-C(15 : 0) (7.0 %) and the polar lipid pattern consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, two phospholipids and a glycolipid. The DNA G+C content was 43.0 mol%. All of these features confirmed the placement of isolate HS286(T) within the genus Thalassobacillus. However DNA-DNA hybridization between strain HS286(T) and the only recognized species of the genus Thalassobacillus, T. devorans G-19.1(T), was 27.3 %, showing unequivocally that the novel isolate constituted a new genospecies. Strain HS286(T) could be clearly differentiated from T. devorans and other phylogenetic neighbours on the basis of several phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic features. Therefore, strain HS286(T) constitutes a novel species, for which the name Thalassobacillus cyri sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HS286(T) (=CCM 7597(T)=JCM 15722(T)).",2009,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Some of Sionâ€™s heirs and relatives,"If one adds one extra assumption to the classical Knasterâ€“ Kuratowskiâ€“Mazurkiewicz (KKM) theorem, namely that the sets Fi are convex, one gets the â€œElementaryâ€ KKM theorem; the name is due to A.

It is shown here that this Elementary KKM theorem is equivalent to Kleeâ€™s theorem, the Elementary Alexandroffâ€“ Pasynkov theorem, the Elementary Ky Fan theorem and the Sionâ€“von Neumann minimax theorem, as well as a few other classical results with an extra convexity assumption; hence the adjective â€œelementary.â€ The Sionâ€“von Neumann minimax theorem itself can be proved by simple topological arguments using connectedness instead of convexity.
