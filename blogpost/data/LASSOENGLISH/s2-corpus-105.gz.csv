Topics in forecasting with factor-augmented models,"This thesis makes three distinct contributions to the literature on factor-augmented models for forecasting economic time series using big datasets. 
The first chapter extends Diebold-Mariano-West type tests of forecast accuracy to apply to factor-augmented models where both factors and model coefficients are estimated in a rolling out-of-sample estimation procedure. This set-up poses new challenges as the sign of neither the factors nor factor-augmented model parameters are identified in different rolling windows. We propose a novel new identification strategy which removes arbitrary sign-changing in the sequence of out-of-sample parameter estimates and allows us to establish the asymptotic normality of the Diebold-Mariano test statistic. We propose a new bootstrap procedure for rolling factor estimates as existing bootstrap methods cannot deal with the generated regressor structure of the factors. 
The second chapter provides consistent information criteria for the selection of forecasting models which use both the idiosyncratic and common factor components of a big dataset. This procedure differs to existing factor-augmented model selection techniques as it depends on estimates of both the factors and the idiosyncratic components. We show that the combined estimation error vanishes at a slower rate than in the case of pure factor-augmented models in most standard economic forecasting scenarios, which makes existing information criteria inconsistent. We solve this problem by proposing modified information criteria which account for the additional source of estimation error. 
The final chapter aims to improve factor-based forecasts by 'targeting' factor estimates with two objectives: (i) so they are more relevant for a specific target variable, and (ii) so that variables with high levels of idiosyncratic noise are down-weighted prior to factor estimation. Existing targeted factor methodologies are only capable of estimating factors with one of these two objectives in mind. We suggest new Weighted Principal Components Analysis (WPCA) and Targeted Generalized PCA (TGPCA) procedures, which both use LASSO-type pre-selection.",2016,

Design Earthquakes and Seismic Demand for Pbee in Far-field and Near-source Conditions,"In this thesis the problem of identification of design earthquakes and seismic demand for performance based earthquake engineering (PBEE) is studied referring to far-field and near-source conditions. 
Ordinary probability seismic hazard analyses (PSHA), usually referred to far-field conditions, are the base of hazard evaluation of the most advanced seismic codes (e.g. Eurocode 8, 2006, CS.LL.PP. 2008, etc.). PSHA allows to identify for each considered site the probability of exceedance of different ground motion intensity measure (IM) levels in a time interval of interest: choosing a return period, and assuming as IM the elastic spectral acceleration at different structural periods, it is possible to build the uniform hazard spectrum (UHS); i.e., the response spectrum with a constant exceedance probability for all ordinates (Reiter, 1990); e.g., 10% in 50 years in the case of design for life-safety structural performance. UHS is not the only possible PSHA-based design spectrum (e.g., Baker 2011), but it is, to date, the most used basis for the definition of design seismic actions on structures. Recent studies are focused on the possibility of reducing uncertainties of PSHA analyses because it will produce a significant reduction of hazard values. Despite that, ordinary PSHA and UHS can be considered as a consolidated procedure which is not discussed here. 
If the seismic assessment of structures is carried out via non-linear dynamic analysis, knowledge of design response spectra is not enough and selecting the seismic input is seen to be one of the most critical issue which is sometimes considered more important even than structural modeling. In general, the signals that can be used for the seismic structural analysis are of three types: (1) artificial waveforms; (2) simulated accelerograms; and (3) natural records (Bommer and Acevedo, 2004). Spectrum-compatible signals of type (1) are obtained, for example, generating a power spectral density function from a code-specified response spectrum, and deriving signals compatible to that. However, this approach may lead to accelerograms not reflecting the real phasing of seismic waves and cycles of motion, and therefore energy. Simulation records (2) are obtained via modeling of the seismological source and may account for path and site effects but, they often require setting of some rupture parameters, such as the rise-time, which are hard to determine. Finally, of type (3) are ground-motion records from real events. The availability of on-line, user-friendly, databases of strong-motion recordings, and the rapid development of digital seismic networks worldwide, have increased the accessibility to recorded accelerograms, which, therefore, have become the most promising candidates for the seismic assessment of structures (Iervolino and Manfredi, 2008). 
In the code approach, selection of natural records has to identify a set compatible with the code-specified spectrum which should include implicitly information about the features of the seismogenic sources determining the seismic hazard at the construction site. Moreover, prudently, the practitioner is often required to also account explicitly for them: for example, Eurocode 8 states that accelerograms should be adequately qualified with regard to the seismogenetic features of the sources [â€¦]. In practical engineering application, accounting for seismological features of the sources is usually not compatible with information and/or ability of practitioners but, in accordance with probabilistic approach, for a given UHS, disaggregation of seismic hazard (Bazzurro and Cornell, 1999), for the exceedance return period and for the spectral ordinate of interest, allows to identify the contribution to the hazard of each seismological features considered in PSHA. Thus earthquakes dominating the hazard at the site (or design earthquakes) may be considered as the events characterized by the seismological features with the maximum contributions to the hazard (McGuire, 1995). 
In the first part of this work issues and findings related to identification of design earthquakes are taken to the Italian national level extending preliminary investigations of Convertito et al., 2009 which were referred to a case study region in the Southern Italy. In a recent work of Barani et al. (2009). disaggregation analyses of Italy were presented but different criteria for identification of design earthquakes were chosen. 
A large part of results obtained here can be considered independent from the specific sites considered and correlated to the typology of analyses: for example it is discussed how and why design earthquakes change with the spectral period (i.e., the dynamic characteristics of the considered structure), or why return period of seismic action may increase the hazard contribution of moderate events respect to the strong distant earthquakes. Moreover general trends of results for Italian sites are identified and a methodology for extracting one or more design earthquakes given disaggregation results is proposed and discussed. Finally, it is illustrated how these concepts may be easily included in engineering practice complementing design hazard maps and effectively enriching definition of seismic action with relatively small effort. The attention to the practical applicability of presented analyses is summarized in their implementation in an already existing and freely distributed software addressed to the code-based record selection (Iervolino et al., 2010 and Galasso et al. 2010). 
In the second part of the work, near-source conditions are considered analyzing the problem of rupture directivity effects. Generally speaking sites that are in a particular geometrical configuration with respect to the rupture may be reached contemporarily by seismic waves generated in different instant of time and velocity fault-normal signals may show a large pulse which occurs at the beginning of the record and contains the most of energy (Somerville et al., 1997). The results are waveforms different from ordinary ground motions recorded in the far field or in geometrical conditions not favorable with respect to directivity (Singh, 1985 and Reiter, 1990). Current attenuations laws are not able to capture such effect well but, unfortunately, it is believed that structures with dynamic behavior in a range of periods related to the pulse period may be subjected to underestimated seismic demand (Tothong and Cornell, 2006). 
So although directivity effects are known since many years to both seismologists and earthquake engineers, many aspects are still to be deepening. A systematic procedure for (i) analyzing resultant signals, (ii) studying structural effects and (iii) including these issues in hazard assessment is still far to be consolidated and as consequence, main European seismic codes do not account for the problem. 
In this work an attempt of improving each one of the previous points is presented. Regarding quantification of structural effects, a strong-motionsâ€™ American database, already classified in pulse-like and non pulse-like signals, is analyzed and three main characteristics of pulse-like records are outlined: (1) the elastic demand is generally larger than that of ordinary recordings, particularly concerning the fault-normal direction; (2) the spectral shape is non-standard with an increment of spectral ordinates in the range around the pulse period; (3) because the pulse period is generally a low frequency one (i.e., in the same order of magnitude of that of the most of common structures) the inelastic demand can be particularly high (Tothong and Luco, 2007) and developed in a comparatively short time which may facilitate fragile collapse mechanisms in structures not properly designed. 
Using previous results as benchmark, signals of the recent Lâ€™Aquila earthquake mainshock are analyzed investigating if directivity effects occurred. In particular, near-source records from the mainshock, rotated in fault-normal (FN) and fault-parallel (FP) directions, are analyzed extracting pulses with the same procedure used for the NGA dataset. Those found as likely containing velocity pulses were compared to: (1) those not identified as pulse-like; (2) the un-rotated components, and (3) to predictive models for the occurrence of directivity pulses and for the pulse period. The features of Lâ€™Aquila records were also compared to those of the NGA database to check whether they are in agreement to what expected for impulsive and non impulsive near-source records. The analyses include also rupture-rotated and vertical components of motion. 
Finally all the recent models regarding pulse-like effects (applied also in the analyses mentioned above) are used for a PSHA which is modified in order to account for near-source conditions (Iervolino and Cornell, 2008). Also disaggregation analysis is adapted to near source conditions as suggested by literatures (Thotong et al., 2007). Illustrative cases are analyzed: they can be considered as some of the first numerical applications of the most recent procedures and they are a way for identifying advantages and limits and for contributing to future improvements.",2010,
Discussion: The Dantzig selector: Statistical estimation when p is much larger than n,"1. Introduction. This is a fascinating paper on an important topic: the choice of predictor variables in large-scale linear models. A previous paper in these pages attacked the same problem using the â€œLARSâ€ algorithm (Efron, Hastie, Johnstone and Tibshirani [3]); actually three algorithms including the Lasso as middle case. There are tantalizing similarities between the Dantzig Selector (DS) and the LARS methods, but they are not the same and produce somewhat different models. We explore this relationship with the Lasso and LARS here. 2. Dantzig selector and the Lasso. The definition of the Dantzig selector (DS) in (1.7) can be re-expressed as",2007,Annals of Statistics

Network Analysis of Psychopathy in Forensic Patients,"The question of which features represent the most central components of psychopathy remains unresolved and is the subject of considerable debate. Network analysis, which is a relatively new way to conceptualize mental disorders that emphasizes complex causal systems, provides a means to graphically and quantitatively describe the centrality of the various symptoms of a disorder. We applied association and adaptive LASSO networks on two samples of forensic patients. The first sample included forensic inpatients (N = 277) who were administered the Psychopathy Checklistâ€”Revised (Hare, 2003), and the second sample included patients who previously had been civilly committed (N = 1136), who were administered the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (Hart, Cox, & Hare, 1995). The models indicated the items on the affective facet are highly central across both samples and methods, and the item â€œlack of remorseâ€ was especially central to the networks. Conversely, interpersonal, lifestyle, and antisocial facets generally resulted in low centrality in the models of both samples. Thus, the models lend support to the importance of affective deficits as the primary feature of psychopathy when psychopathy is assessed using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist measures.",2018,Journal of Abnormal Psychology

New Insights and Faster Computations for the Graphical Lasso,"We consider the graphical lasso formulation for estimating a Gaussian graphical model in the high-dimensional setting. This approach entails estimating the inverse covariance matrix under a multivariate normal model by maximizing the l1-penalized log-likelihood. We present a very simple necessary and sufficient condition that can be used to identify the connected components in the graphical lasso solution. The condition can be employed to determine whether the estimated inverse covariance matrix will be block diagonal, and if so, then to identify the blocks. This in turn can lead to drastic speed improvements, since one can simply apply a standard graphical lasso algorithm to each block separately. Moreover, the necessary and sufficient condition provides insight into the graphical lasso solution: the set of connected nodes at any given tuning parameter value is a superset of the set of connected nodes at any larger tuning parameter value.

Een blik op de mobiliteit van geiten en schapen in het antieke Sagalassos (Turkije),"Het onderstaand artikel presenteert een mobiliteitsstudie die werd uigevoerd aan de hand van een strontiumisotopenanalyse in Sagalassos (Turkije). In de eerste fase werd de strontiumsignatuur van de Sagalassosregio bepaald. Hiervoor werden slakken uit verschillende geologische ondergronden geanalyseerd, waaruit besloten kon worden dat de regio een voldoende grote variatie in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio kent. In totaal werden vier geografische groepen onderscheiden die een verschillend strontiumsignaal gaven. In de tweede fase van dit onderzoek werd er nagegaan of schapen-en geitenstalen uit de antieke site van Sagalassos mobiliteit kenden tijdens hun leven en of hun strontiumwaarden al dan niet overeenkwamen met deze uit de regio. In het kader van dit onderzoek werden verscheidene stalen genomen uit het tandemail van een tand (M3, die wordt gevormd van het eerste levensjaar tot het tweede levensjaar) van drie verschillende schapen/geiten. Uit de analyse bleek dat de waarden van deze tanden binnen het bereik van de omgeving van Sagalassos vielen. Daarnaast suggereren de strontiumwaarden van de schapen/geiten ook dat twee van de drie dieren mobiel waren tijdens hun tweede levensjaar. Ondanks de kleine dataset werden er toch beloftevolle resultaten verkregen, wat de deur opent voor verder onderzoek. This article presents a mobility study of sheep/goat, based on the analysis of strontium isotopes at Sagalassos (Turkey). The starting point of this mobility study is to stipulate the strontium signals of the region of Sagalassos. Therefore, we analysed snails, which were collected at different geological units. The area proved to have a sufficiently large variation in strontium values, whereby we could distinguish four main geographical groups that showed another strontium signal. In the second stage of our research, we investigated whether sheep/goat-samples of the ancient site did have mobility in their life and whether the strontium values of these animals corresponded with the values of the environment. For the sake of this research we analysed several samples of tooth enamel of a single tooth (M3) from three different sheep/goats. The results of this analysis show that the values of the sheep/goats fall within the range of the surroundings of Sagalassos. The strontium results of the sheep/goats also suggested that two of the three animals were mobile in the second year of their life. Despite the small dataset we obtained promising results in this study, which open the door for further research.",2012,Terra Incognita
The Oak Tatters Conundrum,"Oak tatters is a disorder that primarily affects white oaks, but also is observed on hackberry trees. Leaves of affected trees lose the majority of interveinal leaf tissue, resulting in a leaf â€˜skeleton' (Figure 1). The phenomenon was first reported in the early 1980â€™s, and has been observed in many Midwestern states. The number of trees affected varies widely from year to year, with a much higher level of incidence in 2017 than normal. The disorder occurs in both rural and urban areas and may affect single trees and those in woodlands. Symptoms usually are distributed uniformly throughout the tree, rather than being more severe on one side as usually occurs with herbicide drift.

Loss of interveinal leaf tissue typical of oak tatters. There has been relatively little research to identify the causal factor of oak tatters and the cause is still debated. The consensus among many in the forestry arena is that acetochlor and other group 15 herbicides (chloroacetamides) are responsible for the damage. Researchers at the University of Illinois sprayed several herbicides commonly used in corn production at 1, 10, and 25 percent of labeled rates on oak seedlings grown in the greenhouse (Samtani et al. 2008, 2010). Metolachlor (Dual), acetochlor (Harness), and dimethenamid-P (Outlook) caused loss of interveinal tissue (oak tatters) when applied while leaves were expanding. Several years ago I worked with Jesse Randall (ISU Natural Resource Ecology and Management) and was able to induce oak tatter symptoms with lower rates of acetochlor than used in the Illinois research. Foresters with Iowaâ€™s DNR conducted an observational study in 2007. A tree that had developed oak tatters in the past was monitored during the early growing season. Tree pollination bags were placed over several branches in late April and left for five days. The tree developed tatters except for the branches covered with bags. Concentrations of acetochlor in air and rainfall at the site were monitored from April 10 to May 18. Acetochlor concentrations peaked during the time when oak tatters appeared and concentrations of acetochlor were 3-10 times higher in leaves not protected by pollinator bags than covered ones. While research and observations suggest that the group 15 herbicides may be responsible for oak tatters, I still question their role in the problem. Oak tatters was first reported in the 1980â€™s, whereas the group 15 herbicides have been widely used in corn and soybean production since the mid 1960â€™s. Alachlor (Lasso) was used on 1.3 million and 4.0 million acres of corn in Illinois in 1971 and 1978, respectively (Gianessi 1992). Similar use patterns would have occurred in Iowa at the time. Thus, these herbicides were widely used before oak tatters was first reported. Since oak tatters appears in trees both adjacent and isolated from agricultural fields, it has been suggested that herbicide in rain or the atmosphere is responsible. The presence of herbicides in rainfall and air during peak application periods is widely documented â€“ ""Itâ€™s raining Lasso"" was a headline of a Des Moines Register article in 1991. Since the vapor pressure of alachlor is approximately 1000 times higher than acetochlor and 2/19/2019 The Oak Tatters Conundrum | Integrated Crop Management https://crops.extension.iastate.edu/cropnews/2017/06/oak-tatters-conundrum 3/4 metolachlor, rainfall and air in the 1970â€™s should have had higher concentrations of group 15 herbicides than now. Thus, it is likely that oaks were exposed to higher concentrations of group 15 herbicides prior to oak tatters being reported as a problem. Group 15 herbicides are primarily active on emerging seedlings, they generally have little effect on emerged plants. Several of the products are registered for postemergence applications in broadleaf crops, and I have never seen symptoms similar to oak tatters developing on the crops or other vegetation contacted by the spray. Pennant, a formulation of S-metolachlor registered for use in nurseries and landscapes, is approved for over-the-top applications on oaks. Research and a half-century experience in the field suggest that the group 15 herbicides should not produce the symptoms associated with oak tatters; however, scientists have been able to replicate the symptoms in the greenhouse with applications of the herbicides. This is the real mystery to me. A conundrum is defined as a confusing or difficult problem, and identifying the cause of oak tatters remains a real conundrum. While I am not willing to say that acetochlor and other group 15 herbicides cannot be involved in the development of oak tatters, the limited research that has been conducted is insufficient to confidently imply they are the primary cause of oak tatters.",2017,

Dwarf nova EZ Lyncis second visit to instability strip,"The analysis of 14 periodograms of EZ Lyn for the data spaced over 565 d in 2012--2014 (2-3.5 yr after 2010 outburst) yielded the existence of the stable signals around 100 c/d and three signals around 310 c/d, 338 c/d and 368 c/d (the corresponding periods are 864 s, 279 s, 256 s and 235 s). We interpret them as independent non-radial pulsations of the white dwarf in EZ Lyn, but a possibility that a linear combination of frequency at 100 c/d and harmonic of orbital period could produce the frequency at 368 c/d also cannot be excluded. The signal at 100 c/d was detected during the first stay in the instability strip as a transient one. The period at 338 c/d, is a known non-radial pulsation EZ Lyn entered the instability strip after the 2010 outburst. We detected the signals around 310 c/d and 368 c/d for the first time. We applied the two-dimensional least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) analysis for the first time to explore the behavior of these signals on the scale of hours for nightly runs of observations having duration of 6-12 hr. The Lasso analysis revealed the simultaneous existence of all three frequencies (310 c/d, 338 c/d and 368 c/d) for majority of nights of observations, but with variable amplitudes and variable drifts of frequencies by 2-6 percents on a time scale of ~5-7 hr. The largest drift we detected corresponded to 17.5 s in period in ~5 hours.",2014,Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan
Causal Regularization,"I argue that regularizing terms in standard regression methods not only help against overfitting finite data, but sometimes also yield better causal models in the infinite sample regime. I first consider a multi-dimensional variable linearly influencing a target variable with some multi-dimensional unobserved common cause, where the confounding effect can be decreased by keeping the penalizing term in Ridge and Lasso regression even in the population limit. Choosing the size of the penalizing term, is however challenging, because cross validation is pointless. Here it is done by first estimating the strength of confounding via a method proposed earlier, which yielded some reasonable results for simulated and real data. Further, I prove a `causal generalization bound' which states (subject to a particular model of confounding) that the error made by interpreting any non-linear regression as causal model can be bounded from above whenever functions are taken from a not too rich class. In other words, the bound guarantees ""generalization"" from observational to interventional distributions, which is usually not subject of statistical learning theory (and is only possible due to the underlying symmetries of the confounder model).",2019,ArXiv
Evaluation of Different Regularization Methods for the Extreme Learning Machine Applied to Hyperspectral Images,"During recent years, many regularization techniques have been proposed to deal with ill-posed problems related to hyperspectral image classification, in which the limited number of training samples contrasts with the very high spectral dimensionality. However, the intrinsic structure of a hyperspectral image often depends on the specific scene and spectrometer, although regularizers like Ridge, LASSO, etc, have been widely used in practical applications. Instead of imposing these regularizers to the probabilistic output of a classifier, this work evaluates the use of extreme learning machines (ELM) with output weights of a single-hidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN) regularized with Ridge and LASSO priors, respectively. Experimental results with several real hyperspectral images are conducted to compare the performance and adaptation of these two regularizers with the the original ELM in classification scenarios.",2018,IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium

Ability of Radiomics in Differentiation of Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma From Atypical Low-Grade Oligodendroglioma Using Machine-Learning Approach,"Objectives: To investigate the ability of radiomics features from MRI in differentiating anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) from atypical low-grade oligodendroglioma using machine-learning algorithms. Methods: A total number of 101 qualified patients (50 participants with AO and 51 with atypical low-grade oligodendroglioma) were enrolled in this retrospective, single-center study. Forty radiomics features of tumor images derived from six matrices were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1C) images and fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Three selection methods were performed to select the optimal features for classifiers, including distance correlation, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). Then three machine-learning classifiers were adopted to generate discriminative models, including linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and random forest (RF). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to evaluate the discriminative performance of each model. Results: Nine predictive models were established based on radiomics features from T1C images and FLAIR images. All of the classifiers represented feasible ability in differentiation, with AUC more than 0.840 when combined with suitable selection method. For models based on T1C images, the combination of LASSO and RF classifier represented the highest AUC of 0.904 in the validation group. For models based on FLAIR images, the combination of GBDT and RF classifier showed the highest AUC of 0.861 in the validation group. Conclusion: Radiomics-based machine-learning approach could potentially serve as a feasible method in distinguishing AO from atypical low-grade oligodendroglioma.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Regression Performance of Group Lasso for Arbitrary Design Matrices,"In many linear regression problems, explanatory variables are activated in groups or clusters; group lasso has been proposed for regression in such cases. This paper studies the nonasymptotic regression performance of group lasso using `1/`2 regularization for arbitrary (random or deterministic) design matrices. In particular, the paper establishes under a statistical prior on the set of nonzero coefficients that the `1/`2 group lasso has a near-optimal regression error for all but a vanishingly small set of models. The analysis in the paper relies on three easily computable metrics of the design matrix â€“ coherence, block coherence, and spectral norm. Remarkably, under certain conditions on these metrics, the `1/`2 group lasso can perform near-ideal regression even if the model order scales almost linearly with the number of rows of the design matrix.

Transient stability assessment in large-scale power systems based on the sparse single index model,"Abstract We apply a class of nonlinear semiparametric models to the problem of transient stability analysis of a large-scale power system. The mapping between the pre-contingency state and the transient stability boundary (TSB) is modelled by a block-oriented structure known as the single-index model (SIM). In this model one has a single dimensional projection that enters the unknown nonlinearity nonparametrically. Such models form a rich class of nonlinear mappings that includes classical models, e.g., linear and logistic regression, as special cases. The generalized case of the SIM is utilized that is taking into account the sparsity of the projection vector. This yields a low-dimensional nonlinear model suitable for high-dimensional data emerging in modern power systems. The parametric part of the model is obtained by the properly modified sparsity sensitive LASSO algorithm. The nonlinear nonparametric part of the model is estimated by the monotonically corrected kernel regression estimate. The precision of our modeling is verified for two fault cases of the 470-bus power system. It is shown that for the examined faults, the proposed modeling methodology exhibits a stronger prediction accuracy compared to the existing competing methods recently applied in the field, namely, kernel ridge regression, as well as LASSO linear modeling.",2020,Electric Power Systems Research
Atrium-pulmonary vein isolation by radiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and sick sinus syndrome,"Objective The ECG features and the results of atrio-vein isolations by radiofrequency catheter abaltion in patients with brady-tachy arrhythmias syndrome were summarized and analyzed.Methods Eight cases,with mean age of(60.0Â±6.8)years old,were included in this study.All had the history of refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation(AF) and sinus arrest of(5.0Â±1.9)seconds following the termination of AF on Holter recordings.Five cases had dizziness and near syncopy attacks,one had frequent syncopy attacks.Four cases received permanent dual-chamber pacemaker implantation before the procedures.After obtaining informed consent,intracardiac electrophysiologic study(EPS)were performed and the pulmonary veins(PVs)and/or superior vena cava(SVC)were electrically isolated by the radiofrequency catheter ablation technique.Results EPS showed the responsible veins for atrial fibrillation were SVC in 2 cases,LSPV in 3 and indefinable in 3.All cases underwent PVs and/or SVC isolations(10 procedures)guided by the Lasso mapping catheter.During the follow-up of(278Â±159)days,all cases had no recurrence of atrial fibrillation.Four cases without pacemaker implantations also showed normal sinus function with total heart beats of more than 90 000 in 24 hours Holter recordings and no sinus arrests were documented.Conclusion Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in some of the patients with brady-tachy syndrome can be cured by the electrical isolation of PVs and/or SVC with catheter ablation.After that,the function of sinus node associated with the frequent attack of the atrial fibrillaton can be resumed over time,which argues the necessity of the pacemaker implantation in these patients.",2003,Chinese Journal of Cardiac Arrhythmias
Breeding the Indian Verditer Flycatcher Muscicapa thalassina,"There are three flycatchers commonly known as verditer flycatchers: the Philippine, Nilgiri and of course the most familiar of all, the Indian Yerditer Flycatcher. A denizen of lightly wooded, fairly open country, the Indian Verditer is a lively and attractive bird earning its living by hawking insects from its usual perch of a bare twig. Measuring only about 15 cm (6 in.) the two races of the Indian Yerditer M. t. tbalassina and M. t. tbalassoides occupy a large range, stretching from the Himalayas to Indochina, Thailand and Malaysia as well as Sumatra and Borneo. The entire plumage of the male bird is a bright green-blue, with an even brighter color on the head and throat although the wings and tail are somewhat darker. The !oral area is made prominent by a small black patch and the under-tail coverts are highlighted by a dirty white fringe. The female resembles the male but is duller in color throughout and small white spots pepper the throat and sides of the chin. Once acclimatised the Verditer will prove reasonably hardy, but will certainly need heated winter accommodation if kept in an outside flight. The diet is fairly straight forward: I prefer a fine grade insectile mix to which I add various live foods such as meal worms, wax moth larvae, small crickets, blow flies and chrysalises. Approximately 15% of the total diet is made up of live food. Here at Sedgwick County Zoo, our pair ofYerditers are housed in an aviary measuring 3 m x 1 m x 2 m high (10 ft. x 3 ft. x 6 ft. high). It is not an outdoor flight but just one of a complex of aviaries contained within a purposely built ""off exhibit"" facility. The building' temperature is thermostatically controlled and the air humidified by means of a mister system programmed to come on three times a week for a duration of five minutes. During the summer the afternoon temperature of the building will rise to about 28Â°C (82Â° F) and the humidity level will be about 65 percent. During the winter the building will get no cooler than about 16Â°C (60Â° F). In August 1993, our pair of flycatchers successfully fledged one youngster. Their aviary was not heavily planted but merely decorated with two hanging baskets and a 1 m (3 ft.) high ficus tree. This particular pair has been in captivity for several years and has therefore become quite steady in the company of people. A more nervous or newly imported pair would certainly benefit from a thickly planted aviary, especially since in the wild the verditer flycatcher retreats to denser forests to breed. Nest building began on June 22, and lasted for 13 days. A substantial nest was built within an empty half openfronted box measuring 15 cm x 15 cm x 23 cm high (6 in. x 6 in. 9 in.). The nest itself was a full 7 cm (3 in.) deep Q) o c 5 Â§ ro :2 c-, .0 0 _g and comprised: sphagnum moss, pieces o, of fine string, leaf fragments and fine grasses. However, the major ingredient by far was wool. Bison (Bison bison) wool found scattered throughout the zoo's North American Prairie exhibit was used by the flycatchers to build almost 60% of their nest. Interestingly, the birds did appear to discriminate between nesting materials that reflected different levels of brightness. 111e whiter colored wools and plant fibers were repeatedly ignored in favor of the duller shades such as brown and green. Presumably brighter materials are considered too conspicuous to risk the safety of the nest. Throughout the nest building proces and indeed the entire nesting period, the female was extremely adept at concealing her work. Only once did I catch her red-handed and in the process of carrying (bison) wool to the nesting box. But even then when she saw me and realizing she could do nothing to disguise her activity, she froze, looking as guilty as it's possible for a bird to look while trying to remain nonchalant. Not once did I actually see her take nesting material to the box, hut her absence made her very conspicuous and it was therefore easy to surmise her labors. While she worked busily the male appeared to play no part in the nest building, although he would stand guard and alert her to the approach of danger. At such times the very rapid. loud rattle of a song was uttered. Quite a pleasant sound, this appears to be the only voice the verditer flycatcher has; I have never been able to detect any kind of a call-note. A clutch can consist of anything from three to five eggs and sometimes a pair may even only produce two. This pair laid three eggs, almost immediately after the nest was complete. Measuring about 14mm x 20mm C.56 in. x .80 in.), the eggs were devoid of markings being simply a plain, soft ivory color. Incubation began with the laying of the first egg, and the first chick hatched 14 days later. The second chick hatched just over a day after that with the third egg failing to hatch; unfortunately, it was infertile. Sadly within the first day of its life the smaller of the chicks died, but the larger of the two thrived and it fledged only 17 days after hatching. As rearing food, a variety of small live food was provided; the favorite food were flies of ""mini"" maggots. The maggots themselves, which are only about 6mm (.24 in.) long, were also popular but were only considered by the birds when all of the flies had been eaten. A satisfactory way of dispensing the flies is to offer them in a jar whose lid is perforated with a few holes. The flies then escape in small groups, slowly enough to allow the birds to catch them. One must take great care, however, that sufficient flies escape to nourish the youngsters. To guarantee an ample supply it is preferable to deliver handfuls of them to the aviary periodically, in addition to those continually emerging from the jar. Small meal worms were also provided as well as the usual insectivorous diet. All live food was generously sprinkled with calcium lactate and vionate powders. A slightly smaller edition of the adult birds, the youngster's plumage hinted at the green-blue of the future but for the present displayed mostly a dull gray-brown. It was a healthy bird and reached independence about three weeks after fledging.",1996,AFA Watchbird
Deep Residual Learning for Nonlinear Regression,"Deep learning plays a key role in the recent developments of machine learning. This paper develops a deep residual neural network (ResNet) for the regression of nonlinear functions. Convolutional layers and pooling layers are replaced by fully connected layers in the residual block. To evaluate the new regression model, we train and test neural networks with different depths and widths on simulated data, and we find the optimal parameters. We perform multiple numerical tests of the optimal regression model on multiple simulated data, and the results show that the new regression model behaves well on simulated data. Comparisons are also made between the optimal residual regression and other linear as well as nonlinear approximation techniques, such as lasso regression, decision tree, and support vector machine. The optimal residual regression model has better approximation capacity compared to the other models. Finally, the residual regression is applied into the prediction of a relative humidity series in the real world. Our study indicates that the residual regression model is stable and applicable in practice.",2020,Entropy
PERBANDINGAN ANALISIS LEAST ABSOLUTE SHRINKAGE AND SELECTION OPERATOR DAN PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES (Studi Kasus: Data Microarray),"Linear regression analysis is one of the parametric statistical methods which utilize the relationship between two or more quantitative variables. In linear regression analysis, there are several assumptions that must be met that is normal distribution of errors, there is no correlation between the error and error variance is constant and homogent. There are some constraints that caused the assumption can not be met, for example, the correlation between independent variables (multicollinearity), constraints on the number of data and independent variables are obtained. When the number of samples obtained less than the number of independent variables, then the data is called the microarray data. Least Absolute shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a statistical method that can be used to overcome the microarray, overfitting, and multicollinearity. From the above description, it is necessary to study with the intention of comparing LASSO and PLS method. This study uses coronary heart and stroke patients data which is a microarray data and contain multicollinearity. With these two characteristics of the data that most have a weak correlation between independent variables, LASSO method produces a better model than PLS seen from the large RMSEP.",2012,E-Jurnal Matematika

Analysis of Mixed Pulping Raw Materials of Eucalyptus globulus and Acacia mangium by Near Infrared Spectroscopy Technique Combined with LASSO Algorithm,"To meet the current demand in China for Eucalyptus globulus and Acacia mangium mixed pulping, a study was conducted to collect the near infrared (NIR) spectra of 150 mixed samples of E. globulus and A. mangium in which the content of E. globulus was manually controlled. After the original spectra were pretreated by first derivative and standard normal variate (SNV), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and cross-validation were used to calculate the optimal adjustment parameters of 14.30, 19.16, 12.10, and 9.74, respectively. The optimal calibration models for the content of E. globulus, holocellulose, pentosan, and acid insoluble lignin were generated. An independent verification of the calibration models showed that the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for these models was 1.59%, 0.54%, 0.66%, and 0.40%, respectively. The absolute deviation (AD) was -2.58% to 2.73%, -0.91% to 0.84%, -1.19% to 1.06%, and -0.61% to 0.64%, respectively. The prediction performance of the four models was sufficient for real-time analysis in the pulping production line. The LASSO algorithm was judged to be efficient for the prediction and analysis of mixed raw materials in pulping industry.",2018,Bioresources
Conjugate Direction Boosting,"Boosting in the context of linear regression has become more attractive with the invention of least angle regression (LARS), where the connection between the lasso and forward stagewise fitting (boosting) has been established. Earlier it has been found that boosting is a functional gradient optimization. Instead of the gradient, we propose a conjugate direction method (CDBoost). As a result, we obtain a fast forward stepwise variable selection algorithm. The conjugate direction of CDBoost is analogous to the constrained gradient in boosting. Using this analogy, we generalize CDBoost to: (1) include small step sizes (shrinkage) which often improves prediction accuracy; and (2) the nonparametric setting with fitting methods such as trees or splines, where least angle regression and the lasso seem to be unfeasible. The step size in CDBoost has a tendency to govern the degree between L0- and L1-penalization. This makes CDBoost surprisingly flexible. We compare the different methods on simulated and real datas...",2006,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
Study on Analysis and Influence Factors of Credit Card Default Prediction Model,"Credit cards are a bank business in which high income and heavy risk coexist. Along with the development of the credit card business, banks are using the Internet and mobile data to establish customer credit rating system. How to evaluate customer credit from the information that customers fill in, and how to identify the information true or false, and what type of information that customers are asked to fill are crucial for banks. Based on the credit card customer data of 2005 in Taiwan, this article established Lasso-Logistic model and random forest model to explore the key factors which effect customer credit, including individual characteristics and some objective characteristics. Through comparing the prediction accuracy of the model and F score index, we selected the model of better prediction effect to forecast the bank credit card defaults. The establishment of the credit card default prediction model and the exploration of the key factors influencing the customer credit not only have a important guidance value for banks to choose customers and design data, but also can provide certain theoretical support for the credit decisions. In addition, it has a strong theoretical and practical significance.",2016,
HaBitat USe aND SelectiON iN BirDS : FrOM tHeOrY tO MODel Fit,"Studies on habitat use and habitat selection represent a basic aspect of bird ecology, due to its importance in natural history, distribution, response to environmental changes, management and conservation. Basically, a statistical model that identifies environmental variables linked to a species presence is searched for. In this sense, there is a wide array of analytical methods that identify important explanatory variables within a model, with higher explanatory and predictive power than classical regression approaches. However, some of these powerful models are not widespread in ornithological studies, partly because of their complex theory, and in some cases, difficulties on their implementation and interpretation. Here, I describe generalized linear models and other five statistical models for the analysis of bird habitat use and selection outperforming classical approaches: generalized additive models, mixed effects models, occupancy models, binomial N-mixture models and decision trees (classification and regression trees, bagging, random forests and boosting). Each of these models has its benefits and drawbacks, but major advantages include dealing with non-normal distributions (presence-absence and abundance data typically found in habitat use and selection studies), heterogeneous variances, non-linear and complex relationships among variables, lack of statistical independence and imperfect detection. To aid ornithologists in making use of the methods described, a readable description of each method is provided, as well as a flowchart along with some recommendations to help them decide the most appropriate analysis. The use of these models in ornithological studies is encouraged, given their huge potential as statistical tools in bird ecology. KeY-WOrDS: binomial mixture models, classification trees, generalized additive models, generalized linear models, mixed models, occupancy models, regression trees. â€œHabitat selectionâ€, by contrast, refers to a hierarchical process of behavioral responses that may result in the disproportionate use of habitats to influence survival and fitness of individuals (McGarigal et al. 2016). Therefore, habitat selection refers to a process, whereas habitat use refers to the pattern resulting from habitat selection (Jones 2001). In the field, standard approaches to assess bird habitat use or selection involve: (1) sampling the presence or abundance of individuals of a species across sampling units (typically transects or point counts; Bibby et al. 2000) across different habitat types, (2) comparing presence locations with random locations where the species could potentially be present across different habitat types (useavailability or case-control approach; Jones 2001, Keating & Cherry 2004, Johnson et al. 2006), or (3) using tracking devices on individual birds to acquire location data and compare them to available locations where the species was not recorded (Burger & Shaffer 2008, Wakefield et al. 2009, Bridge et al. 2011). With the rise of powerful statistical methods and the advancement of computing facility, more complex designs have been developed Model selection in bird ecology Palacio 91 Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia 26(2): 2018 Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia 26(2): 2018 to assess habitat use and selection. For instance, these approaches can be extended to make repeated visits at the same sampling sites (temporal dependence), repeated observations on the same individuals (e.g. individuals tracked) or sampling many sites located nearby (spatial dependence). Notwithstanding, a plethora of statistical models outperforming classical linear models and which have been used for a while in other research areas (e.g. generalized linear and additive mixed models, Hastie & Tibshirani 1990, Bolker et al. 2009, Zuur et al. 2009; classification and regression trees, De'ath 2002, 2007; Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, Hirzel et al. 2002, Basille et al. 2008; quantile regression, Cade & Noon 2003; regularization methods such as ridge regression and LASSO, Reineking & SchrÃ¶der 2006, James et al. 2013; Artificial Neural Networks, Lek & GuÃ©gan 1999; Flexible Discriminant Analysis, Hastie et al. 1994; Support Vector Machines, Kecman 2005; Bayesian approaches, Ellison 2004) are still not widespread among ornithologists. Some of these methods (e.g. generalized additive models, mixed models), nevertheless, have been widely used in some particular bird groups, such as seabirds (Wakefield et al. 2009, Engler et al. 2017). This phenomenon may be partly due to their relatively complex theory, and in some cases, difficulties on their implementation and interpretation (Bolker et al. 2009, Zuur et al. 2009, Dahlgren 2010). This is accentuated for Bayesian modeling, which represents a completely different statistical paradigm (Dennis 1996, Dorazio 2016). Moreover, early-career researchers tend to be reluctant to new analytical methods, as a result of self-perceived lack of quantitative training (Barraquand et al. 2014). Despite these issues, the methods mentioned typically both offer greater insight than classical approaches and represent no longer a problem in terms of statistical assumptions (Elith et al. 2006, Bolker et al. 2009, Elith & Graham 2009, Shabani et al. 2016). From a statistical view, habitat use models aim to identify environmental variables linked to a species presence or abundance, and are species distribution models by definition (Guisan & Zimmerman 2000). On the other hand, habitat selection models link environmental variables with some proxy of fitness (nest site location, territories, reproductive output; Jones 2001). Although both types of models represent a correlative relationship between a bird species and its habitat, they are often expressed as a causal relationship, where the environment influences or explains the presence or abundance of a certain species:",2018,
Face Recognition Using Sparse Representations and Manifold Learning,"Manifold learning is a novel approach in non-linear dimensionality reduction that has shown great potential in numerous applications and has gained ground compared to linear techniques. In addition, sparse representations have been recently applied on computer vision problems with success, demonstrating promising results with respect to robustness in challenging scenarios. A key concept shared by both approaches is the notion of sparsity. In this paper we investigate how the framework of sparse representations can be applied in various stages of manifold learning. We explore the use of sparse representations in two major components of manifold learning: construction of the weight matrix and classification of test data. In addition, we investigate the benefits that are offered by introducing a weighting scheme on the sparse representations framework via the weighted LASSO algorithm. The underlying manifold learning approach is based on the recently proposed spectral regression framework that offers significant benefits compared to previously proposed manifold learning techniques. We present experimental results on these techniques in three challenging face recognition datasets.",2010,

"Oxygen and strontium isotopes as provenance indicators of fish at archaeological sites: the case study of Sagalassos, SW Turkey","Abstract In this paper, we investigate the potential use of oxygen and strontium isotope ratios (Î´ 18 O p and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) measured in archaeological fish enamel as provenance indicators. Î´ 18 O p and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr were measured in a suite of archaeological carp remains recovered from the Anatolian townsite of Sagalassos dated to the Early Byzantine period (AD 450â€“650) and compared to that of modern fish, river and lake waters from the Anatolian region. We used sequential leaches in weak acetic acid to remove diagenetic Sr from fossil tooth enamel, monitoring the effectiveness of this approach by measuring the Sr/Ca ratios of the leachates via an isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry method (ID-TIMS). Î´ 18 O p values mostly excluded a riverine origin. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of one fish overlapped with the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signatures of two lakes in the Anatolian region, and at least one lake (Golcuk) could be removed as a candidate owing to a very distinctive 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signature not found in any of the fish remains. Most of the tooth samples analyzed could not be assigned a precise geographical origin since the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios measured in enamel did not match that of any of the local lakes selected as potential origin. This result suggests that carp may have originated from lakes that have not yet been sampled, although this conclusion is not supported by other archaeological evidence. Alternatively, the lack of correspondence between lakes and fish Sr isotope ratios highlights several possible sources of uncertainties including spatial heterogeneity in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio within a lake, the contribution of dietary strontium to the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of fish tooth enamel, and post-mortem alteration of the tooth Sr isotope signal during fossilization. In spite of the high precision of the strontium isotope analyses and the wide range of variation in the surface waters of the Anatolian lakes and rivers, this method may remain limited to distinguishing between lakes situated in regions of bedrock of very distinct age and geology until these sources of uncertainty are more fully investigated.",2007,Journal of Archaeological Science
Groundwater Crustaceans as Useful Geological Tools,"Many stygobiont crustaceans presently living in continental subterranean waters are derived from ancestral coastal marine species which stay in sediments when shorelines receded far away during the geological periods of marine regression. The dispersal ability of stygobionts in continental groundwaters is especially low. Thus the present distribution of thalassoid stygobionts fits well with that of areas formerly covered by the sea; such stygobionts may provide information about the place of paleoshores, even when marine sediments were removed by erosion. The place of paleoshores of South-West Morocco are partly known from the survey and the analysis of the present regional stygofauna. The species groups resulting from the phylogenetic analysis of genera or families of thalassoid stygobionts and the analysis of their distribution, allow to date the colonization of groundwater by their marine ancestors. Thus the emersion of a Canarian island was dated by this way, as is datable the emergence of lands in Israel and Palestine. Introduction and General Background Some extant aquatic subterranean species may be used by geologists to locate the shoreline of a former transgressive sea or to date the definitive emersion of a continental sedimentary basin or of an oceanic island (STOCK, 1986; COINEAU, 1990; BOUTIN, 1993a, 1993b). Among metazoans, the crustacean group is the most diversified within groundwaters, both in plain and valley aquifers and in cave rivers or lakes. Such stygobiontic crustaceans (i.e. aquatic and subterranean) are troglobites, in karstic open water, or tiny interstitial phreatobites, in saturated porous sediments. Thalassostygobionts live in littoral marine cave or sediments and limnostygobionts occur in cave and aquifer freshwaters. Only the latter are considered hereafter. Some limnostygobionts belong to groups living also in surface freshwaters. They are derived from freshwater surface ancestors and are termed limnicoid. A well known example is that of the species of the amphipod Gammarus (CULVER et al., 1995).This kind of limnicoid stygobionts provides very few information about the period or the geological events related to the colonization of groundwaters by their ancestors, as this colonization may have occurred repeatedly at the same place and at different periods of the past, up to now. Therefore they are generally considered as uninformative for geologists. Other limnostygobionts belong to marine groups not known in freshwaters. Due to their direct marine origin they are called thalassoÃ¯d limnostygobionts (COINEAU & BOUTIN, 1992; BOUTIN, 1993a, 1993b). The marine origin of such crustaceans has been proposed for a long time (JEANNEL, 1943; DELAMARE DEBOUTTEVILLE, 1957, 1960; VANDEL, 1964, GINET & DECOU, 1977 etc...). For example, out of 350 cirolanid species (isopods), some 85% are epigean, marine or littoral, whereas the other 15% are freshwater stygobites more or less resembling their marine littoral ancestors (BOTOSANEANU, 1986). These stygobionts evolved from marine ancestral populations which first colonized littoral sediments (or sometimes littoral caves) in the Mesozoic or Cenozoic periods; thereafter they adapted to brackish water, then to freshwater and settled during a marine regression when the shoreline receded. This ""Regression model evolution"" (STOCK, 1977, 1980) was analysed and viewed as the second stage of a ""Two step model of colonization and evolution"" (BOUTIN & COINEAU, 1990; NOTENBOOM, 1991; COINEAU & BOUTIN, 1992; HOLSINGER, 1994). Thalassoid limnostygobionts consequently occur in sedimentary basins of continents formerly covered by the sea during a transgression, before the shoreline recede during the following regression. It is well known and 13th International Congress of Speleology 4th Speleological Congress of Latin AmÃ©rica and Caribbean 26th Brazilian Congress of Speleology BrasÃ­lia DF, 15-22 de julho de 2001 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------356 -------------------------------------------------------------------------www.sbe.com.br sbe@sbe.com.br generally accepted that interstitial crustaceans have very poor dispersal abilities (see for example HOLSINGER, 1986) and that stygobiontic populations stay in place and remain alive up today as ""Living fossils"" (DELAMARE DEBOUTTEVILLE & BOTOSANEANU, 1970; TERMIER, 1983), so that the most internal part of the present distribution area of a thalassoid stygobiont provides a good information about the place of the paleoshore during the maximum of the transgression (which occurred before the marine regression which will allow the colonization of groundwaters). Finally these living fossils are present markers of paleoshores. Geologists used to consider the limits of occurrence of sedimentary rocks deposited during a period of embayment as the location of the paleo-shorelines at the same period, except when there is a clear evidence of erosion of the considered layer. However in some cases these sedimentary rocks may have been completely removed by an important continental erosion. Consequently the groundwater primitively contained in these marine sedimentary formations have moved down and lasted in more ancient sediments or in the basal altered plutonic rocks, thus allowing the survival and permanence of thalassoid stygobiontic populations which remain the sole evidence of the marine transgression. Therefore the location of paleoshorelines may be inferred only from the limits of the present distribution area of these stygobionts. On the other hand the colonization of continental groundwaters by some thalassostygobiontic populations may have occured during the marine regression which resulted in the definitive emersion of a sedimentary basin (or an oceanic island when thalassoid limnostygobionts occur in groundwaters of an island). If it is possible to date this colonization i.e. the ecological change of crustacean biotopes, from coastal marine environment to continental groundwaters then it is possible to date the simultaneous marine regression. Now it is well known by paleontologists as well as by stygobiologists (DUCASSE et al., 1983; BOUTIN & COINEAU, 1991, 2000) that the evolutionary rate is faster in a changing and unstable environment, such as coastal biotopes, than in a more stable biotope like bathyal or phreatic and continental biotopes. Continental groundwater appears as a conservative environment housing a lot of ""living fossils"". Recent colonizers of groundwater which evolved for a longer time in littoral milieus than older colonizers exhibit therefore a more important morphological evolution than the more ancient colonizers, which evolved in littoral biotopes for a shorter period. It is why the phylogenetic analysis of the stygobitic species forming a genus or a family, generally shows that the most primitive lineages (monophyletic groups of species) include the species with a distribution indicating a freshwater entrance during the oldest geologic periods. In contrast, the most derived lineage comprises species, the origin of which is correlated with the latest marine regression in the study area. Therefore when the divergences of a cladogram are dated, based on biogeographic and geological data from a well known region, then it is possible to infer the date of a marine regression in another region if a new stygobiontic species of the group occurs in this new region. Moroccan stygobiontic models used in the Mediterranean Basin The geological history of Morocco is relatively well known, and two groups of stygobiontic crustaceans occur in numerous regions of this country. They are both sufficiently diversified in many species presently well known; their phylogenetic and biogeographic study provides the possibility of dating the origin of different lineages within each group. The family Metacrangonyctidae include to date more than 40 stygobiontic species of amphipods, about 36 of which occur in Morocco (MESSOULI, 1994). The cladistic analysis of the family clearly shows four lineages; three of them belong to the genus Metacrangonyx and the fourth and most derived one forms the genus Longipodacrangonyx (MESSOULI, 1988, 1994; BOUTIN, 1994b). The two more primitive lineages, morphologically well characterized, arise from a trifurcation dated from the Turonian regression (some 90 My BP), the third lineage appears later and in relation with the Senonian marine regression (70 My BP), and the last one, originating the genus Longipodacrangonyx, is related with the Lutetian regression (some 40 Ma) as the species of this genus occur only within the limits of eocene gulfs. The cirolanid isopods of the ""Typhlocirolana group"" include to date four genera and more than 25 stygobiontic species of which about 12 belong to two genera occurring in Morocco (BOUTIN, 1993a, 1993b). The cladogram of Moroccan species exhibit exactly the same topology as that of the metacrangonyctid amphipods, showing four clearly distinguishable lineages. The two more primitive lineages (having retained a number of characteristics of extant marine cirolanids) occur in regions flooded during the CenomanoTuronian times, the third lineage includes the most derived species of the genus Typhlocirolana which occurs in regions flooded during the Senonian, and the fourth lineage is formed by the genus Marocolana, whose distribution is included within the paleoshores of the Lutetian gulfs. 13th International Congress of Speleology 4th Speleological Congress of Latin AmÃ©rica and Caribbean 26th Brazilian Congress of Speleology BrasÃ­lia DF, 15-22 de julho de 2001 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------357 -------------------------------------------------------------------------www.sbe.com.br sbe@sbe.com.br The striking similarity of the two plylogenetic cladograms and that of the two area cladograms was pointed out by BOUTIN (1993a) and suggests the same historical biog",2010,
Latent Common Return Volatility Factors: Capturing Elusive Predictive Accuracy Gains When Forecasting Volatility,"In this paper, we use factor-augmented HAR-type models to predict the daily integrated volatility of asset returns. Our approach is based on a proposed two-step dimension reduction procedure designed to extract latent common volatility factors from a large dimensional and high-frequency returns dataset with 267 constituents of the S&P 500 index. In the first step, we apply either LASSO or elastic net shrinkage on estimates of integrated volatility of all constituents in the dataset, in order to select a subset of asset return series for further processing. In the second step, we utilize (sparse) principal component analysis to estimate latent common asset return factors, from which latent integrated volatility factors are extracted. Although we find limited in-sample fit improvement, relative to a benchmark HAR model, all of our proposed factor-augmented models result in substantial out-of-sample predictive accuracy improvement. In particular, forecasting gains are observed at market, sector, and individual-stock levels, with the exception of the financial sector. Further investigation of the factor structures for non-financial assets shows that industrial and technology stocks are characterized by minimal exposure to financial assets, inasmuch as forecasting gains associated with factor-augmented models for these types of assets are largely attributable to the inclusion of non-financial stock price return volatility in our latent factors.",2017,Social Science Research Network
Shrinkage and penalized likelihood as methods to improve predictive accuracy,"A review is given of shrinkage and penalization as tools to improve predictive accuracy of regression models. The James-Stein estimator is taken as starting point. Procedures covered are Pre-test Estimation, the Ridge Regression of Hoerl and Kennard, the Shrinkage Estimators of Copas and Van Houwelingen and Le Cessie, the LASSO of Tibshirani and the Garotte of Breiman. An attempt is made to place all these procedures in a unifying framework of semi-Bayesian methodology. Applications are briefly mentioned, but not amply discussed.",2001,Statistica Neerlandica
Invertebrate Faunal Diversity in Mangroves of Odisha,"Mangroves are assemblages of halophytes that grow at land-sea interface of the tropical and subtropical regions of the globe. In Odisha, mangroves are distributed in three zones - Mahanadi delta, Brahmani-Baitarani delta (Bhitarkanika mangrove) and Budhabalanga-Subarnarekha river coast (Balassore coast). Mangroves occupy about 33.7% of the total forest of Odisha.

Version 1: \(\ell _1\)-Input Regularised Quadratic MPC,"This chapter introduces the first and simpler of the proposed \(\ell _{asso}\)-MPC versions. The cost function is the same as for a standard quadratic MPC, with the addition of a 1-norm penalty on the input channels. Similar to LASSO regression and the elastic-net, it is shown that this cost function can produce (for LTI systems) sparse input predictions under certain conditions. This characteristic is then shown to result in a control law that is nonlinear, even without constraints. This is in clear contrast with LQ-MPC, the unconstrained solution of which is a constant gain. The explicit solution of \(\ell _{asso}\)-MPC for LTI systems is shown to be unique, continuous and piece-wise affine in the control error. The main feature of the control law is an implicit input dead-zone, namely, the regularised actuators being exactly at zero when the control error belongs to a certain neighbourhood of the origin. The shape and extent of this region depend on the cost function as well as the constraints. The explicit solution is computed for a small example to illustrate these properties. The solution path of \(\ell _{asso}\)-MPC is then shown to be also piece-wise affine, and it is computed by means of a single multi-parametric quadratic program.",2016,
Successive Ray Refinement and Its Application to Coordinate Descent for Lasso,"Coordinate descent is one of the most popular approaches for solving Lasso and its extensions due to its simplicity and efficiency. When applying coordinate descent to solving Lasso, we update one coordinate at a time while fixing the remaining coordinates. Such an update, which is usually easy to compute, greedily decreases the objective function value. In this paper, we aim to improve its computational efficiency by reducing the number of coordinate descent iterations. To this end, we propose a novel technique called Successive Ray Refinement (SRR). SRR makes use of the following ray continuation property on the successive iterations: for a particular coordinate, the value obtained in the next iteration almost always lies on a ray that starts at its previous iteration and passes through the current iteration. Motivated by this ray-continuation property, we propose that coordinate descent be performed not directly on the previous iteration but on a refined search point that has the following properties: on one hand, it lies on a ray that starts at a history solution and passes through the previous iteration, and on the other hand, it achieves the minimum objective function value among all the points on the ray. We propose a scheme for defining the search point and show that the refined search point can be efficiently obtained. Empirical results for real and synthetic data sets show that the proposed SRR can significantly reduce the number of coordinate descent iterations, especially for small Lasso regularization parameters.",2016,ArXiv
A Brief History of the Kkm Theory,"We review briefly the history of the KKM theory from the original KKM theorem in 1929 to the birth of the new KKM spaces. We recall Fanâ€™s works on the KKM theory from $1960s$ to $1980S_{1}^{\cdot}$ and various intersection theorems and equilibrium problems investigated by many authors. In 1983-2005, basic results in the theory was extended to convex spaces by Lassonde, to C-spaces by Horvath, and to $Garrow convex$ spaces due to Park. In 2006, we introduced the concept of abstract convex spaces $(E,\cdot D;\Gamma)$ on which we can constmct the KKM theory and study multimap classes $R\mathfrak{C}$ and $RD$ . Moreover, abstract convex spaces satisfying an abstract form of the KKM theorem and its â€œopenâ€ version are called $KKM$ spaces. We show that the class of KKM spaces are really adequate to establish the essential part of the KKM theory. Now the KKM theory becomes the study of the KKM spaces.",2011,

Integrated Analysis of the Functions and Prognostic Values of RNA Binding Proteins in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Dysregulation of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) has been found in a variety of cancers and is related to oncogenesis and progression. However, the functions of RBPs in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) remain unclear. In this study, we obtained gene expression data and corresponding clinical information for LUSC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, identified aberrantly expressed RBPs between tumors and normal tissue, and conducted a series of bioinformatics analyses to explore the expression and prognostic value of these RBPs. A total of 300 aberrantly expressed RBPs were obtained, comprising 59 downregulated and 241 upregulated RBPs. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the differentially expressed RBPs were mainly associated with mRNA metabolic processes, RNA processing, RNA modification, regulation of translation, the TGF-beta signaling pathway, and the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Nine RBP genes (A1CF, EIF2B5, LSM1, LSM7, MBNL2, RSRC1, TRMU, TTF2, and ZCCHC5) were identified as prognosis-associated hub genes by univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Kaplanâ€“Meier survival, and multivariate Cox regression analyses, and were used to construct the prognostic model. Further analysis demonstrated that high risk scores for patients were significantly related to poor overall survival according to the model. The area under the time-dependent receiver operator characteristic curve of the prognostic model was 0.712 at 3 years and 0.696 at 5 years. We also developed a nomogram based on nine RBP genes, with internal validation in the TCGA cohort, which showed a favorable predictive efficacy for prognosis in LUSC. Our results provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of LUSC. The nine-RBP gene signature showed predictive value for LUSC prognosis, with potential applications in clinical decision-making and individualized treatment.",2020,Frontiers in Genetics
Abstract 3228: Using paired tissue and serum samples to characterize human lung cancer metabolomics with 1H HRMAS MRS.,"Purpose: We used high resolution magic angle spinning proton MRS to identify metabolomic profiles of lung cancer tissue and serum samples. Previous studies have reported that profiles for lung cancer tissue may be predictive of the profiles of matched serum samples. We further searched correlations of metabolomic data with traditional histopathology from the same tissue samples, and identified serum lung cancer metabolomic markers based on matched tissue analysis. Methods: Paired tissue and serum samples from 107 patients of adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 29 serum samples from control subjects without lung disease, were analyzed. MR experiments were carried out on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer operating at 600 MHz (14.1T) and pre-cooled to 4Â°C. A 4mm zirconia rotor was used with inserts to create a 10Î¼l sample space, and D 2 O was added for 2 H field locking. Rotor spinning rate was regulated and verified by measuring the inter-SSB distances from spectra with an accuracy of 1.0Hz. A repetition time of 5s and 128 transients were used to acquire each spectrum. Spectra were collected with a spinning rate of 3600Hz, with a rotor synchronized CPMG filter to reduce broad resonances. Spectra were analyzed by an in-house MatLab based program. After spectroscopy, tissue samples were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut into sets of 5Î¼m sections at 100Î¼m intervals, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Volume percentages of histological features (cancer, stroma, necrosis, lymphatic structures, and cartilage) were quantified by a pathologist. Results: We used Lasso, a feature selection method using L1 regularized linear regression, to select a subset of peaks from the spectral results to build a linear model to predict AC/SCC readings. A 2-peak model (peaks at 2.14-2.10 and 0.89-0.89 ppm) has been identified as the most optimal model, and the predicted probability from this model agrees well with the AC/SCC readings. We used the same procedure to build predictive models for quantitative histopathology readings from serum and tissue samples. Out of the four histopathology readings (%Cancer, %Fibrosis/ Inflammation, %Necrosis and %Cartilage), we were able to build a model for %Fibrosis/Inflammation (p =1E-5) using 3 peaks from serum samples (peaks at 2.09-2.03, 1.33-1.32 and 3.27-3.24), and a model for %cancer cells (p =0.002) using one peak from tissue samples (peak at 3.73-3.71). Further data analyses are still underway. Conclusions: These preliminary results, showing the potential to predict AC/SCC status with metabolomic profiles from serum, could have important implications in the screening for lung cancer. If patients could be identified by suspicious serum metabolomic profiles, and subsequently undergo more advanced imaging, lung cancer could be diagnosed at an earlier stage where effective treatment and a good prognosis is more likely.

Juvenile convict cichlids shoaling decisions in relation to shoal size and age,"Forming social groups is a behavior that is nearly ubiquitous across the animal kingdom (Krause & Ruxton, 2002). The evolutionary benâ€ efits that drive this behavior include increased efficiency in foraging (Lachlan, Crooks, & Laland, 1998; Potts, Baken, Ortmann, Watts, & Wrangham, 2015), higher vigilance (Godin, Classon, & Abrahams, 1988), and general advantages related to predator avoidance (reâ€ viewed in Krause & Ruxton, 2002). Despite these benefits, there are also costs associated with congregating in large groups, such as greater competition for limited resources, including mates and food (Ford & Swearer, 2013), or an increased risk of disease (SeppÃ¤lÃ¤, Karvonen, & Valtonen, 2008). Based on these costs and benefits, predictions can be made reâ€ garding the optimal characteristics individuals should seek in their group mates. For example, based on the â€œdilution effect,â€ an animal should choose to be part of a larger, rather than a smaller, group beâ€ cause as numbers increase within the group, each individual is less and less likely to be the one that is targeted by a predator (Foster & Treherne, 1981).

Inference of gene regulatory networks by integrating gene expressions and genetic perturbations,"To elucidate the overall relationships between gene expressions and genetic perturbations, many approaches for SNPs to be involved in gene regulatory network (GRNs) inference have been suggested. In the most of the inferences of networks named as SNP-Gene Regulatory Networks (SGRNs) inference, pairs of SNP-gene are still separately given by performing eQTL mappings but eQTLs are not identified during network constructions. In order to build a SGRN for a given set of genes and SNPs without pre-defined eQTL information, we propose a method that is based on a structural equation model. The method consists of three steps: (i) ridge regression, (ii) elastic net regression, and (iii) iterative adaptive lasso regression. In the inference, it is assumed that each gene has a single unknown eQTL. The first two steps are to remove false positive edges keeping as many true positive edges as possible, and then lastly, final edges are selected by iterative adaptive lasso regression that iteratively gives more weight to the edge whose coefficient value is relatively high. To evaluate the performance, the method is applied to data that is randomly generated from the simulated networks and parameters. The method is also applied to psychiatric disorder data. There are three main contributions in this work. First, the proposed method provides both the gene regulatory inference and the identification of eQTL that affect genes in the network. Second, the simulation result proves that an integrative approach of multiple regression methods can effectively detect true edges as well as filter false positive edges. Lastly, it is demonstrated by applying it to psychiatric disorder data that our inference without eQTL information can discover the SGRNs that partially confirms eQTLs identified by our previous work.",2013,2013 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine
Compressive sensing-based DOA estimation using the Dantzig selector,"In this paper, a new compressive sensing (CS)-based direction of arrival (DOA) estimation technique using the Dantzig selector is proposed. The proposed scheme can identify more source signals than the number of sensors used, without requiring an a priori knowledge of the number of source signals to be estimated and without any constraint or assumption about the nature of the signal sources using a fewer number of snapshots. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared to that of the Zhang penalty-based algorithm and the MVDR A-LASSO DOA estimation technique. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is substantially lower than that of the Zhang penalty-based method or MVDR A-LASSO.",2017,2017 IEEE 60th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)
Bayesian bridge quantile regression,"ABSTRACT Regularization methods for simultaneous variable selection and coefficient estimation have been shown to be effective in quantile regression in improving the prediction accuracy. In this article, we propose the Bayesian bridge for variable selection and coefficient estimation in quantile regression. A simple and efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm was developed for posterior inference using a scale mixture of uniform representation of the Bayesian bridge prior. This is the first work to discuss regularized quantile regression with the bridge penalty. Both simulated and real data examples show that the proposed method often outperforms quantile regression without regularization, lasso quantile regression, and Bayesian lasso quantile regression.",2019,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
Relationship between the MDS-UPDRS and Quality of Life : a large international multicenter study of 3206 patients,"250 words, limit 250) Background The relationship between Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and MDS-UPDRS has not been fully studied so far. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between all MDS-UPDRS components and HRQoL in a representative international cohort of PD patients. Methods We collected demographic and disease-related data as well as MDS-UPDRS and PDQ8 scales. Data were analyzed using two hierarchical multiple regressions, first between the MDS-UPDRS Parts scores and PDQ8 and second between individual items from those Parts demonstrating significant relationship to PDQ8 in the first regression. LASSO regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between PDQ8 and all individual MDS-UPDRS items. Results A total of 3206 PD patients were included in the study. In the first regression analysis PDQ8 was significantly related to MDS-UPDRS parts I and II, but not III and IV. In the second regression model significant contributions to PDQ8 were found for Part I items Fatigue, Pain, Depressed mood, Apathy; and Part II items Dressing, Doing hobbies, Freezing, Speech and Tremor. In the LASSO analysis, five Part I, six Part II, three Part III and one Part IV items contributed to PDQ8 scores. Five items most significantly related to the model were Depressed mood, Dressing, Apathy, Pain and Fatigue. Conclusions This is so far the largest study related to HRQoL issues in PD. Restrictions in activities of daily living and non-motor symptoms significantly contribute to QoL in PD.",2018,
Estimation of formal verification cost using regression machine learning,"Formal Verification is a computationally expensive step in the verification of today's complex hardware designs. Effective results can be obtained from formal runs by planning ahead the effort and cost that are required for them. Additionally estimating in-advance the expected formal's complexity promotes a lot of potential tricks and clever setup techniques to overcome the initial push-button capacity limitation of the formal verifies and improve their capabilities to handle designs with higher complexity. This paper illustrates the application of regression machine learning (ML) techniques to build an estimation model for the cost of formal verification. Up to 10,000 formal verification runs on RTL designs with good varieties of design/properties attributes are used to learn the relationship between HW designs and the final formal cost in terms of formal run time. We demonstrate the use of Ridge-Regression to decide on the bias-variance trade-off during the regression-model design step as well as the application of Lasso-Regression for the feature selection phase. Finally a comparison between the proposed multiple linear regression approach and another non-parametric K-nearest neighbors kernel based regression technique is done to conclude on the presented work. Our results indicate how the proposed model managed to estimate with reasonable error ratio the expected formal verification effort for new-to-verify HW designs.",2016,2016 IEEE International High Level Design Validation and Test Workshop (HLDVT)

"Epidemics of Tomato torrado virus, Pepino mosaic virus and Tomato chlorosis virus in tomato crops: do mixed infections contribute to torrado disease epidemiology?","Torrado disease was first observed in protected tomato crops in the Murcia province of Spain in spring 2001, causing serious concern to regional tomato producers. The disease-causing agent was initially identified as a picornalike bipartite plant RNA virus, now known as Tomato torrado virus (ToTV), but several additional torradoviruses inducing similar disease symptoms have been described more recently. We studied the incidence of torradoviruses between 2005 and 2008 in two parts of Murcia (Spain) where tomato crops are grown commercially. We also analysed the potential association among ToTV, Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) and Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) in samples showing torrado symptoms of varying severity. ToTV was the only torradovirus found in the samples (predominantly as single infections), but double and triple infections comprising ToTV, PepMV and/or ToCV were also detected. There was no evidence of a specific association among the viruses as the frequencies of mixed infections did not deviate from those expected to occur by chance. Statisticalanalysis of the potentialassociation between torrado symptoms and the type of infection (single or multiple) was inconclusive. To determine whether co-infections with ToTV and PepMV have any marked influence on the torrado disease, we analysed torrado symptom severity and virus accumulation in tomato plants experimentally infected with ToTV-CE, PepMV-Sp13 and PepMV-PS5 in single and mixed infections. The severity of the torrado symptoms was not affected by the presence of PepMV. In single infections, the ToTV titre remained very low, reaching its maximum in the early stages of infection and declining rapidly thereafter, whereas the disease symptoms became more severe over the same timescale. In mixed infections, the accumulation of both ToTV and PepMV was altered with respect to single infections, and the magnitude of this alteration appeared to be virus and strain specific. Therefore, ToTV and PepMV mixed infections may modulate the epidemiology of both viruses in a complex way by altering virus fitness. The impact of our studies on efforts to track and prevent the spread of torrado disease is discussed.",2010,Annals of Applied Biology

Mapping Multivariate Influence of Alloying Elements on Creep Behavior for Design of New Martensitic Steels,"Heritage data for the class of 9 to 12 wt pct Cr steels are studied using data science to quantify the statistically significant relationships among multiple processing/microstructure and performance variables. The effort is undertaken to find new martensitic steels for creep life of $$10^5{{\text { hours}}}$$105hours or greater at 650Â Â°C and 100 MPa using machine learning. Linear regression and lasso regression were utilized to identify alloying elements that contribute towards better creep strength. Visualization techniques such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and pair-wire element specific comparisons were utilized to explore information gaps that exist within the data and are in conflict with existing domain knowledge. Combining all results suggest that the next alloy design to be explored should be 9 wt pct Cr with high W (2 to 3 wt pct) and high Co (2 to 3 wt pct) for creep life of $$10^5\,\,{\text { hours}}$$105hours or greater at 650Â Â°C, 100 MPa.",2019,Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A
"Predicting Persistent Opioid Use, Abuse and Toxicity Among Cancer Survivors.","BACKGROUND
While opioids play a critical role in the management of cancer pain, the ongoing opioid epidemic has raised concerns regarding their persistent use and abuse. We lack data-driven tools in oncology to understand the risk of adverse opioid-related outcomes. This project seeks to identify clinical risk factors and create a risk score to help identify patients at risk of persistent opioid use and abuse.


METHODS
Within a cohort of 106,732 Veteran cancer survivors diagnosed between 2000 and 2015, we determined rates of persistent post-treatment opioid use, diagnoses of opioid abuse or dependence, and admissions for opioid toxicity. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify patient, cancer, and treatment risk factors associated with adverse opioid-related outcomes. Predictive risk models were developed and validated using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression technique.


RESULTS
The rate of persistent opioid use in cancer survivors was 8.3% (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰8.1 - 8.4%), the rate of opioid abuse or dependence was 2.9% (95%CI=2.8-3.0%), and the rate of opioid-related admissions was 2.1% (95%CI=2.0-2.2%). On multivariable analysis, several patient, demographic, cancer and treatment factors were associated with risk of persistent opioid use. Predictive models showed a high level of discrimination when identifying individuals at risk of adverse opioid-related outcomes including persistent opioid use (area under curve [AUC]= 0.85), future diagnoses of opioid abuse or dependence (AUC=0.87) and admission for opioid abuse or toxicity (AUC=0.78).


CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates the potential to predict adverse opioid-related outcomes among cancer survivors. With further validation, personalized risk stratification approaches could guide management when prescribing opioids in cancer patients.",2019,Journal of the National Cancer Institute
Initiation of Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy in Black and White Women With Breast Cancer,"Background Adjuvant endocrine therapy reduces risk of recurrence and mortality in women with hormone receptorâ€“positive breast cancer, yet many women never initiate it. We examined the influence of race, sociocultural factors, and processâ€ofâ€care factors on initiation of adjuvant endocrine therapy in a racially diverse sample. Patients and Methods Eligible women were originally recruited for the Narrowing the Gaps in Adjuvant Therapy Study (2006â€2011). Sociocultural and processâ€ofâ€care factors were collected via telephone surveys before adjuvant therapy. Clinical factors were abstracted from charts. Penalized LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) logistic regression model was used to identify variables associated with initiation. Results Of the 270 women, 55.6% were black and the rest were white. Most women (74.8%) initiated therapy. A significant interaction (P = .008) was found between race and age. Black women aged â‰¤ 50 years had the lowest initiation (59.7%) compared to black women > 50 years (87.1%), white women â‰¤ 50 years (73.7%), or white women > 50 years (72.0%). Multivariate analysis found that younger black women exhibited a marginally higher risk of noninitiation compared to older black women. Additionally, ratings of financial access, presence of comorbidities, and levels of communication were all associated with endocrine therapy initiation. Conclusion Black women â‰¤ 50 years of age and women with financial constraints may be important subgroups for interventions. Patientâ€“provider communication appears to be an important leverage point to foster therapy uptake. Microâ€Abstract Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) is recommended for women diagnosed with hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer. AET reduces breast cancer recurrence and morality. Black women have high rates of breast cancer morality and recent reports suggest that black women with HR positive disease have higher breast cancer mortality than white women with HR positive disease. Thus, initiation of AET may be particularly important for black women with HR positive breast cancer. Information about the impact of race on initiation of AET is limited and has been inconsistent. This study focused on 270 black (n = 150) and white (n = 120) women with HR positive breast cancer. We found that the initiation of chemotherapy was related to a combination of womanâ€™s age and race rather than just her race alone. Black women (â‰¤50 years old) had the lowest rate of AET initiaiton 59.7%. The proportional representation of Black and White women in our study may have aided our ability to examine differences within subgroups rather than just between Blacks and Whites which highlights the need for diverse study samples.",2018,Clinical Breast Cancer

[Clinical usefulness of the non-invasive functional study of the lower urinary tract voiding phase as a predictor of resolution after the first endoscopic treatment of vesico-ureteral reflux in children older than 3 years.],"OBJECTIVES
To determine the usefulnessof voiding diary (VD), uroflowmetry with electromyography(UF-EMG), bladder wall thickness (before micturition)(VWTUS) and residual urine (PVR) (ultrasound measure)in predicting the outcome of the first endoscopic treatment(1ENDT) of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children> 3 years.


METHODS
Cross-sectional ambispective study of 48children with vesicoureteral reflux. Those with previousendoscopic treatment, age or neurological abnormalities and a history of urethralor abdominal surgery were excluded. The outcomevariable was the correctness (by isotopic cystography)three months after 1ENDT. Univariate and multivariateanalyses were performed through a Multilayer Perceptronnetwork and a logistic regression model EmpiricalBayesian penalized type LASSO Elastic net. Diagnosticaccuracy were determined.


RESULTS

Value of pre-therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics in predicting EGFR mutation status in patients with non-small cell lung cancer,"To assess the predictive power of pre-therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT-based radiomic features for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status in non-small cell lung cancer. Two hundred and forty-eight lung cancer patients underwent pre-therapy diagnostic 18F-FDG PET/CT scans and were tested for genetic mutations. The LIFEx package was used to extract 47 PET and 45 CT radiomic features reflecting tumor heterogeneity and phenotype. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used to select radiomic features and develop a radiomics signature. We compared the predictive performance of models established by radiomics signature, clinical variables, and their combinations using receiver operating curves (ROCs). In addition, a nomogram based on the radiomics signature score (rad-score) and clinical variables was developed. The patients were divided into a training set (n = 175) and a validation set (n = 73). Ten radiomic features were selected to build the radiomics signature model. The model showed a significant ability to discriminate between EGFR mutation and EGFR wild type, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) equal to 0.79 in the training set, and 0.85 in the validation set, compared with 0.75 and 0.69 for the clinical model. When clinical variables and radiomics signature were combined, the AUC increased to 0.86 (95% CI [0.80â€“0.91]) in the training set and 0.87 (95% CI [0.79â€“0.95]) in the validation set, thus showing better performance in the prediction of EGFR mutations. The PET/CT-based radiomic features showed good performance in predicting EGFR mutation in non-small cell lung cancer, providing a useful method for the choice of targeted therapy in a clinical setting.",2019,European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging
Efficient and Accelerated Online Learning for Sparse Group Lasso,"The batch-mode group lasso algorithms suffer from the inefficiency and poor scalability, and online learning algorithms for group lasso, is a promising tool for attacking the large-scale problem. However, the low time complexity of current online algorithm often be accompanied by low convergence rate, and the faster convergence rate is a key problem to guarantee the online learning algorithms. We develop a novel accelerated online learning algorithm to solve sparse group lasso model. The sparse group lasso model can achieve more sparsity in both the group level and the individual feature level. By adopting dual averaging method, its worst-case time complexity and memory cost at each iteration are both in the order of O (d), where d is the number of dimensions. Moreover, our online algorithm has a accelerated capability, and its theoretical convergence rate is O (1/T2) up to T-th step. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the merits of the proposed online algorithm for sparse group lasso.",2014,
Robust Nonparametric Regression via Sparsity Control With Application to Load Curve Data Cleansing,"Nonparametric methods are widely applicable to statistical inference problems, since they rely on a few modeling assumptions. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from variable selection and compressive sampling, to robustify nonparametric regression against outliers-that is, data markedly deviating from the postulated models. A variational counterpart to least-trimmed squares regression is shown closely related to an l0-(pseudo)norm-regularized estimator, that encourages sparsity in a vector explicitly modeling the outliers. This connection suggests efficient solvers based on convex relaxation, which lead naturally to a variational M-type estimator equivalent to the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). Outliers are identified by judiciously tuning regularization parameters, which amounts to controlling the sparsity of the outlier vector along the whole robustification path of Lasso solutions. Reduced bias and enhanced generalization capability are attractive features of an improved estimator obtained after replacing the l0-(pseudo)norm with a nonconvex surrogate. The novel robust spline-based smoother is adopted to cleanse load curve data, a key task aiding operational decisions in the envisioned smart grid system. Computer simulations and tests on real load curve data corroborate the effectiveness of the novel sparsity-controlling robust estimators.",2012,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Online Learning of Structured Predictors with Multiple Kernels,"Training structured predictors often requires a considerable time selecting features or tweaking the kernel. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) sidesteps this issue by embedding the kernel learning into the training procedure. Despite the recent progress towards efficiency of MKL algorithms, the structured output case remains an open research front. We propose a family of online algorithms able to tackle variants of MKL and group-LASSO, for which we show regret, convergence, and generalization bounds. Experiments on handwriting recognition and dependency parsing attest the success of the approach.",2011,
3D kinematic and dynamic analysis of the front crawl tumble turn in elite male swimmers.,"The aim of this study was to identify kinematic and dynamic variables related to the best tumble turn times (3mRTT, the turn time from 3-m in to 3-m out, independent variable) in ten elite male swimmers using a three-dimensional (3D) underwater analysis protocol and the Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) as statistical method. For each swimmer, the best-time turn was analyzed with five stationary and synchronized underwater cameras. The 3D reconstruction was performed using the Direct Linear Transformation algorithm. An underwater piezoelectric 3D force platform completed the set-up to compute dynamic variables. Data were smoothed by the Savitzky-Golay filtering method. Three variables were considered relevant in the best Lasso model (3mRTT=2.58-0.425 RD+0.204 VPe+0.0046 TD): the head-wall distance where rotation starts (RD), the horizontal speed at the force peak (VPe), and the 3D length of the path covered during the turn (TD). Furthermore, bivariate analysis showed that upper body (CUBei) and lower limb extension indexes at first contact (CLLei) were also linked to the turn time (r=-0.65 and p<0.05 for both variables). Thus the best turn times were associated with a long RD, slower VPe and reduced TD. By an early transverse rotation, male elite swimmers reach the wall with a slightly flexed posture that results in fast extension. These swimmers opt for a movement that is oriented forward and they focus on reducing the distance covered.",2012,Journal of biomechanics
"Slavery in the French Caribbean, 1625-1715: A Marxist Analysis","The exact relationship between the emergence of the Caribbean plantation slave economy and nascent capitalism is still not clear to many (see, for example, Meillassoux, 1975; 19). The Caribbean plantation colonies were based on African slave labor. They were the creation mostly of the seventeenth century. Capitalism was born from the womb of the feudal mode of production that still dominated most of Europe in the seventeenth century. The problem of the connection between slavery and nascent capitalism complicates the understanding of that stage of the transition from feudalism to capitalism that extends at least to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, when the English seized the asiento slave-delivery contract from the French. Feudal relations of production then still held sway almost everywhere in Europe, including the powerful absolutist France of Louis XIV (1643-1715)-a rising competitor in the Atlantic slave trade and a rapacious exploiter in the Caribbean of African slave labor. At that juncture, capitalist relations of production predominated only in the Netherlands, and perhaps in England after 1689. Nowhere else in the world",1986,Journal of Black Studies

[Outline of a method for estimating the economic cost of malaria: application to a rural area in Burkina Faso (West Africa)],All illnesses which incapacitate workers such as malaria cause economic losses. A method by which to precisely estimate the cost of malaria illness in rural zones was developed and applied in 3 villages of the Bobo Dioulasso region of Burkina Faso. Both direct and indirect costs comprise the overall cost of having and resolving malaria. The particular interest of the formula is in estimating the indirect cost of the disease which is the more difficult of the 2 components of total cost of accurately assess especially at the aggregate level. The model uses the following variables: the patient s age the degree of incapacity the length of illness profession income and percentage of income lost. These variables can be readily measured. During the period June-December 1992 3065 patients were registered in the 3 villages of whom 353 (11.6%) were confirmed as having malaria. 73.1% of these patients were 0-5 years old 13.9% were aged 6-15 years and 12.2% were aged 16-50 years. 73.1% were unemployed while 24.5% worked in the agricultural sector. Workers were incapacitated for an average duration of 4 days with each case incurring a cost of $11.70 comprised of $8 in direct costs and the remainder in indirect costs.,1997,Tropical Medicine & International Health
Retrograde fluoroscopy-guided trans-urethral exchange of ureteral stents: Comparison of direct grasping vs. modified snare,"BACKGROUND
Several different techniques including guide-wire lasso, simple snare, modified snare (MS) and direct grasping (DG), are available for retrograde ureteral stent retrieval and exchange. Choice among them is not always easy and depends on many different factors, including the local level of expertise.


OBJECTIVE
To compare the MS and DG during retrograde exchange of double-J ureteral stent under fluoroscopic guidance.


SETTINGS AND DESIGN
66 patients (36 men and 30 women; mean age 66.6 years) needing retrograde ureteral stent exchange were included. All stents were previously placed through an anterograde way.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Time needed to grasp each single stent was recorded as well as the complications.


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Fisher's test was used to compare procedural time in both groups; P < 0.05 was considered significant.


RESULTS
102 stents were exchanged. Mean time was 4.46 min for DG and 7.81 min for MS (P = 0.029). No significant complications were encountered.


CONCLUSIONS
Compared to the MS, the DG is easier, quicker, and less expensive.",2013,The Indian Journal of Radiology & Imaging
Transvenous extraction of a broken atrial lead embolised into the pulmonary artery using a pigtail catheter.,"A 57-year-old man with an AAI pacemaker was referred to the hospital due to suspicion of an atrial lead failure. The pacemaker was implanted 9 years earlier because of sick sinus syndrome. The atrial lead was inserted by puncture of the right subclavian vein with the pocket located at the same site. Currently the patient presented with mild asymptomatic bradycardia of 50 bpm. For 3 months he had noticed pectoral muscle contractions that depended on body position. Pacemaker control revealed atrial lead impedance exceeding 2000 Ohms and lack of either proper sensing or stimulation. Chest X-ray showed a lead breakage at the level of the right clavicle and migration of the proximal fragment of the broken lead to the left pulmonary arteries (Fig. 1). There were no significant abnormalities in echocardiogram and the patient was referred for elective transvenous lead extraction. The procedure of transvenous extraction of the broken atrial lead was conducted under general anaesthesia and consisted of the following steps. First, after percutaneous puncture of the left subclavian vein, a coronary sinus (CS) cannulation catheter (Medtronic Attain CommandÂ®, USA) was inserted to the level of the right ventricle. Then, the pigtail catheter (Abbot Laboratories, USA) was advanced and positioned in parallel to the atrial lead in the pulmonary trunk. The lead was caught with the pigtail catheter by rotating it (Fig. 2A) and pulling it down (Fig. 2B) to the vena cava superior. The lead was grabbed with the lasso wire (Fig. 2C) and pulled into the CS catheter. A Green inner (10.0/12.1-French) Byrd dilator sheath (Cook Medical, Germany) was glided down over the CS catheter (Fig. 2D), and the lead was extracted completely. The procedure, as well as the postprocedural period, was uncomplicated. The patient was discharged home in good condition on the third day after the procedure. The pulse generator and remaining proximal part of the atrial lead removal was planned as a next step procedure. Complete breakdown and migration of the lead is a rare complication of electrotherapy. The presence of a broken lead in the pulmonary arteries, although asymptomatic at the beginning, may end with perforation and, in the case of invective endocarditis when left in place, is a life-threatening and incurable condition. In situations like this, early transvenous lead extraction before any complications appear is the management of choice. Procedures with extraction of embolised leads are very difficult and should be performed in experienced centres with cardiac surgery backup. The situation is more complicated because there are no tools dedicated to that kind procedure. We present how typical instruments available in haemodynamic and electrophysiology laboratories, such as pigtail or CS catheters, may be used to achieve a successful and safe result in such a complex lead extraction.

Scalpel: Extracting Neurons from Calcium Imaging Data.,"In the past few years, new technologies in the field of neuroscience have made it possible to simultaneously image activity in large populations of neurons at cellular resolution in behaving animals. In mid-2016, a huge repository of this so-called ""calcium imaging"" data was made publicly available. The availability of this large-scale data resource opens the door to a host of scientific questions for which new statistical methods must be developed. In this paper we consider the first step in the analysis of calcium imaging data-namely, identifying the neurons in a calcium imaging video. We propose a dictionary learning approach for this task. First, we perform image segmentation to develop a dictionary containing a huge number of candidate neurons. Next, we refine the dictionary using clustering. Finally, we apply the dictionary to select neurons and estimate their corresponding activity over time, using a sparse group lasso optimization problem. We assess performance on simulated calcium imaging data and apply our proposal to three calcium imaging data sets. Our proposed approach is implemented in the R package scalpel, which is available on CRAN.",2018,The annals of applied statistics
Catheter ablation in a patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and partial anomalous pulmonary vein connection.,"A 76-year-old woman with almost daily episodes of highly symptomatic drug refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) was referred to our center for catheter ablation. The left atrium (LA) was not dilated with 39 mm. Preprocedural imaging of the patient was done using a 64-slice CT scanner. It showed an anomalous right upper pulmonary vein (RUPV) connecting to the superior vena cava (SVC) in close proximity to the branching of the inominate veins (Fig. 1A). A circular catheter-guided ablation approach with two transseptal punctures and a 3-D mapping system with image integration (Carto, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) was performed with continuous monitoring of LA-to-pulmonary-vein-conduction. Circumferential ablation lines were placed in the LA around the funnel of the 2 left PVs and the right lower PV at the LA level. Radiofrequency ablation was delivered with a 3.5 mm irrigated-tip catheter (Navistar RMT Thermocool, BiosenseWebster). The complete isolation of the left PVs and around the right lower PV was the electrophysiological endpoint. To evaluate the electrical activity of the anomalous RUPV, a 10-pole circular catheter (Lasso Catheter, Biosense Webster) was placed inside the ostium and contrast medium was delivered through a steerable sheath (Agilis, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) (Fig. 1B). The electrograms of the circular catheter in the RUPV did not show any active or passive electrical activity and, therefore, no electrical disconnection/isolation was necessary in this vein.",2011,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology
Functional Movement Screen Items Predict Dynamic Balance Under Military Torso Load.,"INTRODUCTION
Musculoskeletal injuries threaten military readiness and impose a significant financial burden. The functional movement screen (FMS), a 7-item, preparticipation screening tool, may aid in identifying compensatory movement patterns that can hinder physical performance and lead to injuries in active-duty military personnel. The primary aim of our study was to determine if items scores from the traditional FMS or a modified FMS (mFMS) obtained under loaded conditions can predict dynamic balance scores while wearing a military load.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Thirty physically active adults (19 males and 11 females) who qualified for Army basic training completed unloaded and loaded FMS testing. Loaded balance was assessed using the Y balance test and the Biodex balance system. The mFMS and both loaded balance assessment protocols included a military load consisting of a standard issue rucksack (M.O.L.L.E.), kevlar helmet, and weighted vest (massÂ =Â 24.2Â kg).


RESULTS
mFMS item scores were significantly lower than FMS scores for six of the seven movement items. Both FMS and mFMS composite scores were correlated with Y balance scores (FMS: rÂ =Â 0.53, PÂ =Â 0.003; mFMS: rÂ =Â 0.37, PÂ =Â 0.043). Participants with higher composite scores (â‰¥15) outperformed those with lower composite scores (â‰¤14) for the FMS (PÂ =0.006, dÂ =Â 1.16) and mFMS (PÂ =Â 0.031, dÂ =Â 0.75). Lasso penalized regression analyses revealed that (1) higher unloaded in-line lunge subscores predicted better Y balance scores, (2) loaded trunk stability push-up scores of three predicted worse balance on the Biodex, and (3) unloaded and loaded shoulder mobility scores of 3 predicted better performance on the Biodex balance system.


CONCLUSIONS
The in-line lunge subscore from the FMS was the strongest predictor of torso-loaded balance, and the FMS may be more appropriate than a torso-loaded FMS battery when predicting torso-loaded balance among adults with body composition and fitness profiles similar to those of entering military recruits. These findings provide evidence supporting the use of the conventional FMS to identify active-duty personnel who exhibit greater balance deficits and may develop related musculoskeletal injuries while performing operational tasks that require the transport of heavy loads over long distances.",2019,Military medicine
Linear Time-Periodic System Identification with Grouped Atomic Norm Regularization,"This paper proposes a new methodology in linear time-periodic (LTP) system identification. In contrast to previous methods that totally separate dynamics at different tag times for identification, the method focuses on imposing appropriate structural constraints on the linear time-invariant (LTI) reformulation of LTP systems. This method adopts a periodically-switched truncated infinite impulse response model for LTP systems, where the structural constraints are interpreted as the requirement to place the poles of the non-truncated models at the same locations for all sub-models. This constraint is imposed by combining the atomic norm regularization framework for LTI systems with the group lasso technique in regression. As a result, the estimated system is both uniform and low-order, which is hard to achieve with other existing estimators. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the grouped atomic norm method does not only show better results compared to other regularized methods, but also outperforms the subspace identification method under high noise levels in terms of model fitting.",2020,ArXiv
Thresholded Adaptive Validation: Tuning the Graphical Lasso for Graph Recovery,"The graphical lasso is the most popular estimator in Gaussian graphical models, but its performance hinges on a regularization parameter that needs to be calibrated to each application at hand. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration scheme for this parameter. The scheme is equipped with theoretical guarantees and motivates a thresholding pipeline that can improve graph recovery. Moreover, requiring at most one line search over the regularization path of the graphical lasso, the calibration scheme is computationally more efficient than competing schemes that are based on resampling. Finally, we show in simulations that our approach can improve on the graph recovery of other approaches considerably.",2020,
Robust regression with high-dimensional data,"In many statistical methods, complications arise when the number of dimensions d in a data set is relatively large. Due to overfitting and multicollinearity, linear regression estimates often suffer from numerical instability when the amount of predictors is large. In this research, I compare regularized regression methods that are developed to alleviate the consequences of multicollinearity and overfitting, such as ridge regression and lasso. I combine these methods with an outlier detection algorithm, developed by Rousseeuw & Van den Bossche (2016), that is capable of finding outlying cells and rows in highdimensional data sets, taking correlations between variables into account. With this combination, high-dimensional regression estimates are found that are robust to both rowwise and cellwise outliers.",2017,
Coordinate space form of interacting reference response function of jellium model of an electron liquid,"Abstract The interacting reference response function Ï‡I(k) of jellium in k space is defined, according to Niklasson (1974), in terms of the momentum distribution n(p) of the interacting electron liquid in a similar way as the Lindhard function Ï‡o(k) in terms of the Fermi distribution no(p). Here the Fourier transform FI(r) of Ï‡I(k) is investigated. Using the known analytic behaviour of n(p), the small and large r forms of FI are exhibited explicitly. In an Appendix, it is shown that a suitable model of n(p) can be constructed which interpolates between these limits. Some brief comments are added concerning the representation of FI(r) in terms of the Green function.",1995,Physics and Chemistry of Liquids
Prey naivete to invasive lionfish Pterois volitans on Caribbean coral reefs,"Native prey can be particularly vulnerable to consumption by exotic predators. Prey naivete, the failure to recognize a novel predator due to lack of recent co-evolutionary history, likely facilitates the disproportionate impact that some exotic predators exert on prey populations. Lionfish Pterois volitans, exotic predators from the Pacific, have invaded coral reefs and other coastal habitats along the western Atlantic. Prey naivete towards novel lionfish was tested in field experiments and with observations using closest approach distance as the anti-predator response. We quantified the distance of prey fishes to exotic lionfish in both the Atlantic and Pacific (invasive and native ranges of lionfish) as well as to native predators in the Atlantic. In the Atlantic, exper- iments indicated that Haemulon plumierii, prey of lionfish, generally display a closer approach distance to exotic than to native predators, and field observations of free-ranging fish revealed that at least 5 other species of small fishes (Halichoeres bivitattus, Halichoeres garnoti, Scarus tae- niopterus, Stegastes leucostictus and Thalassoma bifasciatum) also might exhibit limited predator- avoidance behaviour towards invasive lionfish. We also found that 3 families of small fish (Labri- dae, Pomacentridae and Scaridae) maintained greater distances from lionfish in the Pacific compared with the Atlantic in both experimental and field observations. These results suggest prey naivete to exotic lionfish by at least 8 species of fish (Abudefduf saxatilis, H. plumierii, H. bivitattus, H. garnoti, S. taeniopterus, Sparisoma aurofrenatum, S. leucostictus and T. bifasciatum) in the Atlantic, which could be contributing to the rapid expansion of this invasive species by enhancing its fitness and reproductive output through high predation efficiency.",2016,Marine Ecology Progress Series
Evaluation of secondary ions related to plant tissue using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator.,"With regard to life sciences, it is important to understand biological functions such as metabolic reactions at the cellular level. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) that can provide chemical mappings at 100â€‰nm lateral resolutions is useful for obtaining three-dimensional maps of biological molecules in cells and tissues. TOF-SIMS spectra generally contain several hundred to several thousand secondary ion peaks that provide detailed chemical information. In order to manage such a large number of peaks, data analysis methods such as multivariate analysis techniques have been applied to TOF-SIMS data of complex samples. However, the interpretation of the data analysis results is sometimes still difficult, especially for biological samples. In this study, TOF-SIMS data of resin-embedded plant samples were analyzed using one of the sparse modeling methods, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), to directly select secondary ions related to biological structures such as cell walls and nuclei. The same sample was measured by optical microscopy and the same measurement area as TOF-SIMS was extracted in order to prepare a target image for LASSO. The same area of the TOF-SIMS and microscope data were fused to evaluate the influence of the image fusion on the TOF-SIMS spectrum information using principal component analysis. Specifically, the authors examined onion mycorrhizal root colonized with Gigaspora margarita (an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus). The results showed that by employing this approach using LASSO, important secondary ions from biological samples were effectively selected and could be clearly distinguished from the embedding resin.",2020,Biointerphases
Warm Marine Carbonate Environments and Dolomitization,"Abstract Modern marine carbonate environments do not correspond precisely to the ancient ones, qualitatively or quantitatively. General classification of marine sediments should be redesigned to include Pelagic, Terrigenous, Volcanic and Biohermal (where ""biohermal"" is taken to mean all the sediments associated with organic reef structures, massive, clastic or chemical). Both pelagic and biohermal suites may be largely carbonate, and the others may contain smaller quantities. In origin the bulk of modern carbonates are organic or organogenic, being partly neritic, partly bathyal (pelagic). In view of the organic origin of petroleum, a basic genetic relationship exists with carbonate environments. In the past the bulk of limestones were laid down in neritic environments. Their formation would be favored by thalassocratic sea-level conditions. In these warm shallow regions large amounts of magnesium carbonate were concentrated within organic calcite crystal lattices. This is the only important source of marine magnesium carbonate, but the resultant solid solutions are unstable. This leads to mobilization of small amounts of Ca and Mg ions which, in an alkaline medium (under reducing conditions and a high pH) and an unlimited supply of additional Mg ions (from sea or connate water), provides a potential source of dolomite. Under thermodynamic control, dolomitization may proceed at any appropriate stage of diagenesis, from soon after sedimentation to the post-orogenic period.",1955,
Sparse signal recovery for WIM measurements from undersampled data through compressed sensing,"Abstract This study presents a method to recover the signal components critical for weigh-in-motion (WIM) measurements using compressed sensing. Through a comparative study, the wavelet basis â€˜bior2.4â€™ is selected to sparsely represent the measured signals. Two methods, LASSO and Partial Inversion (PartInv), are used to recover the critical pulses from numerically decimated signals. Research results show that, compared with the LASSO method, the PartInv method improves the recovering accuracy of the pulse peaks by 70% on average and enhances the measurement reliability. This study offers a method of recovering the critical pulses for WIM and other types of measurements from undersampled signals. The proposed method enables the equipment designed for low-frequency measurements to achieve satisfactory measurements that requires a much higher sampling frequency. It has the potential to reduce the cost, energy, data storage, and data transmission requirements in practical implementations of undersampled WIM strain measurements and others.",2020,Measurement
Exploring the LASSO as a Pruning Method,"In this study, the efficiency of various pruning algorithms were investigated, with an emphasis on regularization methods. Pruning is a method which aims to remove excess objects from a neural network. In particular, this included the LASSO (Least Asbolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and the extensions derived from it, which were compared with other methods, including optimal brain damage and the elastic net. Initially, this was implemented for MLPs, but the same methods were extended to CNNs with some alterations for increased computational efficiency. Pruning was then implemented on the level of weights, neurons as well as filters. It was concluded that the LASSO tends to yield a superior sparsity on the level of weights, but the group LASSO's ability to select variables simultaneously is a worthwhile addition. Also, optimal results can be obtained by combining both while regularizing the cost function.",2019,

Trahit sua quemque voluptas. The multidimensional satisfaction of foreign tourists visiting Italy,"Abstract Is everyone truly drawn by his or her own delight ? Tourist satisfaction - and hence the attractiveness of key tourism destinations - is a multifaceted phenomenon, the understanding of which requires fully integrated and multidimensional interpretative frameworks. Assuming that tourist satisfaction plays a crucial role in defining the present and future of any tourism product or service, we focus on the perception that foreign visitors have of Italy as tourism destination by adopting a multidimensional approach that is based on quantitative information derived from official statistics. Using microdata from the Survey on International Tourism conducted by the Bank of Italy in 2016, the perceived quality of Italian tourism was assessed using an original framework grounded in the counting approach proposed by Chakravarty and D'Ambrosio (2006) and the dominance criterion introduced by Lasso de la Vega (2010). This methodology allows evaluation of the satisfaction of specific subgroups of tourists and analyses differences in perceived quality that is attributable to specific sociodemographic traits. By investigating multiple aspects of tourist satisfaction with a common interpretative framework, the empirical results of this study constitute an advanced knowledge for evaluation of the efficiency of policies promoting tourism attractiveness in Italy.",2019,Socio-economic Planning Sciences
How to approach reentrant atrial tachycardia after atrial fibrillation ablation.,"A 63-year-old male patient was admitted for catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). On echocardiography, the left atrial (LA) size was 48 mm and the left ventricular function was normal. After electric cardioversion, ipsilateral pulmonary veins (PVs) were circumferentially ablated in sinus rhythm using double-Lasso (Lasso, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA) technique.1â€“3 Both ipsilateral PVs were simultaneously isolated. Two years later, the patient was admitted for the ablation of recurrent, drug-resistant atrial tachycardia (AT) (Figure 1A).



Figure 1. 
A , Twelve-lead electrogram of the clinical atrial tachycardia. B , Entrainment mapping at right inferior pulmonary vein (RIPV) showed that postpacing interval tachycardia cycle length was 10 ms. RA indicates right atrium; CS, coronary sinus.



The baseline tachycardia cycle length (TCL) was 350 ms. A 20-pole mapping catheter (Irvine Biomedical Inc, Irvine, CA) was inserted through the right jugular vein and positioned in the coronary sinus (CS). An 8-mm-tip ablation catheter (Japan Lifeline Inc, Tokyo, Japan) was advanced into the LA through a transseptal puncture. Mapping during AT revealed the resumption of conduction in the right PVs. On entrainment mapping, the Î” post pacing interval (PPI-TCL) was found to be 120, 70, 56, and 10 ms at the low lateral right atrium, anterior LA, bottom of LA, and left septum near the right PVs, respectively. On activation mapping using a 3D electroanatomic mapping system (Carto, Biosense Webster), earliest atrial activation was observed on the roof of right superior vein and the latest at the bottom of right inferior vein. Successful entrainment from the superior and inferior veins revealed that both sites were within the tachycardia circuit (Figure 1B and 2A). Entrainment from the LA septum near the right PVs demonstrated that septal myocardium was also a part of the reentrant circuit.

Sparse identification for nonlinear optical communication systems : SINO method,"We introduce a low complexity machine learning method method (based on lasso regression, which promotes sparsity, to identify the interaction between symbols in different time slots and to select the minimum number relevant perturbation terms that are employed) for nonlinearity mitigation. The immense intricacy of the problem calls for the development of ""smart"" methodology, simplifying the analysis without losing the key features that are important for recovery of transmitted data. The proposed sparse identification method for optical systems (SINO) allows to determine the minimal (optimal) number of degrees of freedom required for adaptive mitigation of detrimental nonlinear effects.

Efficient Sparsity Estimation via Marginal-Lasso Coding,"This paper presents a generic optimization framework for efficient feature quantization using sparse coding which can be applied to many computer vision tasks. While there are many works working on sparse coding and dictionary learning, none of them has exploited the advantages of the marginal regression and the lasso simultaneously to provide more efficient and effective solutions. In our work, we provide such an approach with a theoretical support. Therefore, the computational complexity of the proposed method can be two orders faster than that of the lasso with sacrificing the inevitable quantization error. On the other hand, the proposed method is more robust than the conventional marginal regression based methods. We also provide an adaptive regularization parameter selection scheme and a dictionary learning method incorporated with the proposed sparsity estimation algorithm. Experimental results and detailed model analysis are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods.",2014,
BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL VARIATION BETWEEN THE MUCUS AND THE STING VENOM FROM THE CATFISH Cathorops spixii,"Thalassophryne nattereri, popularly known as Niquim is responsible for many accidents in fishermen in the Northeast of Brazil. The Niquim venom provoked pain, edema, transitory ischemia and alteration in the renal function. In this work, we have examined the action of T. nattereri antivenom on renal effects caused by T. nattereri fish venom. Isolated kidneys from Wistar rats of 240-280g weight were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 6% of bovine serum albumin. The parameters studied included perfusion pressure (PP), renal vascular resistance (RVR), urinary flow (UF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The Niquim venom (3mg/mL), antivenom (3mg/mL) alone or antivenom plus Niquim were added to the system 30 minutes after the beginning of each experiment. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and Bonferoni test with (*p&lt;0.05). The antivenom reverted the increase in PP (control = 110.2 Â± 3.7mmHg; niquim = 148.2 Â± 6.9mmHg*; antivenom=126.8Â±6.7mmHg), RVR (control=5.48Â±0.53mmHg/mL/g/min; niquim=7.75Â±0.7mmHg/mL/g/min*; antivenom=6.86Â±0.4mmHg/mL/g/min*), UF (control = 0.16 Â± 0.02mL/g/min; niquim = 0.40 Â± 0.08mL/g/min*; antivenom=012Â±0.013mL/g/min), GFR (control=0.69Â±0.08mL/g/min; niquim=2.47Â±0.69mL/g/min*; antivenom=0.51Â±0.06mL/g/min) promoted by Thalassophryne nattereri fish venom. In conclusion, the antivenom was able to inhibit the effects induced by Thalassophryne natterer venom in the isolated kidney.",2007,
How did the Commedia dell'arte cross the Alps to Bavaria?,"From the 1570s onwards, the commedia dell'arte was spread throughout Europe by mixed-gender travelling troupes of professional Italian actors. Records suggest that even before that it was a popular and established feature of Bavarian court festivities. This article examines ways in which it could have reached Bavaria by such an early date. In particular, it focuses on the possible role in this diffusion of the musician Orlando di Lasso, and of Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria, whose journal of his journey to Italy to represent his family at the Medici court wedding of 1565 contains descriptions of theatrical performances.",1991,Theatre Research International
Bayesian quantile regression for single-index models,"Using an asymmetric Laplace distribution, which provides a mechanism for Bayesian inference of quantile regression models, we develop a fully Bayesian approach to fitting single-index models in conditional quantile regression. In this work, we use a Gaussian process prior for the unknown nonparametric link function and a Laplace distribution on the index vector, with the latter motivated by the recent popularity of the Bayesian lasso idea. We design a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference. Careful consideration of the singularity of the kernel matrix, and tractability of some of the full conditional distributions leads to a partially collapsed approach where the nonparametric link function is integrated out in some of the sampling steps. Our simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the Bayesian method versus the frequentist approach. The method is further illustrated by an application to the hurricane data.",2013,Statistics and Computing
CT-based radiomic model predicts high grade of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,"PURPOSE
To compare the predictive models that can incorporate a set of CT image features for preoperatively differentiating the high grade (Fuhrman III-IV) from low grade (Fuhrman I-II) clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).


MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and fourteen patients with ccRCC treated with a partial or radical nephrectomy were enrolled in the training cohort. The six non-texture features, including Pseudocapsule, Round mass, maximal tumor diameter (Diametermax), intratumoral artery (Arterytumor), enhancement value of the tumor (TEV) and relative TEV (rTEV), were assessed for each tumor. The texture features were extracted from the CT images of the section with the largest area of renal mass at both corticomedullary and nephrographic phases. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to screen the most valuable texture features to calculate a texture score (Texture-score) for each patient. A logistic regression model was used in the training cohort to discriminate the high from low grade ccRCC at nephrectomy. The predictors would include all non-texture features in Model 1, all non-texture features and Texture-score in Model 2, and Texture-score in Model 3. The performance of the predictive models were tested and compared in an independent validation cohort composed of 92 cases with ccRCC.


RESULTS
Inter-rater agreement was good for each non-texture feature and Texture-score (the concordance correlation coefficient or Kappa coefficientâ€¯>â€¯0.70). The Texture-score was calculated via a linear combination of the 4 selected texture features. The three models shown good discrimination of the high from low grade ccRCC in the training cohort and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.826 in Mode 1, 0.878 in Model 2 and 0.843 in Model 3, and a significant different AUC was found between Model 1 and Model 2. Application of the predictive models in the validation cohort still gave a discrimination (AUCâ€¯>â€¯0.670), and the Texture-score based models with or without the non-texture features (Model 2 and 3) showed a better discrimination of the high from low grade ccRCC (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.05).


CONCLUSION
This study presented the Texture-score based models can facilitate the preoperative discrimination of the high from low grade ccRCC.",2018,European journal of radiology
[In vivo sensitivity of Plasmodium faciparum to chloroquine and sulfadoxine pyrimethamine in the Bobo Dioulasso region (1998-2001): risk factors associated with treatments failures to the two drugs].,"The therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) was determined over a 4 year period (1998-2001) in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, with an analysis of the risk factors associated to treatment failures to the 2 drugs. In total, 2008 children (6 months-15 years old) attending in 4 health centres (1 urban and 3 rural) were included in the study. Children were alternatively allocated to either CQ or SP The WHO 14-days in vivo field test was carried out. PCV was measured at day 0 and 14. CQ treatment failure was 24.4% (229/940), most of them being late failures. Between 1998 and 2001 a significant increase in CQ treatment failure (p < 0.001) was observed. SP showed a good efficacy with a total treatment failure of 4.4% (33/749). However; a significant increase of resistance to this drug (p=0.001) was also observed between 1998 and 2001. Among children with anaemia at day 0.85% (23/27) were no more anaemic by day 14 in the SP group, while in the CQ group the proportion was lower; 69% (27/39). However the difference between the two drugs was not significant (p > 0.1). Univariate analysis showed that the site, the age of children, the time of recruitment and the parasitaemia were significantly associated with CQ treatment failure. In the multivariate analysis these 4 variables remain significantly and independently associated with the risk of CQ treatment failure. After adjusting for the effect of the 3 other factors, the risk of treatment failure was reduced by half in rural area compared to urban area as well as in children of 5-15 years of age compared to those under 5. The risk of treatment failure was significantly increased in 2000-2001 (OR = 1.66, p < 0.05) as compared to the 2 previous years (1998-1999). It was also twice higher in children with parasitaemia > or = 16,000/microl than in those having a lower parasitaemia. For SP we have not observed such connexions with the univariate and multivariate analysis.",2006,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique
Chemical Therapeutics The HSP 70 and Autophagy Inhibitor Pi fi thrin-m Enhances the Antitumor Effects of TRAIL on Human Pancreatic Cancer,"TRAIL and agonistic death receptor-specific antibodies can induce apoptosis in cancer cells with little cytotoxicity to normal cells. To improve TRAIL-induced antitumor effects, we tested its effectiveness in combination with pifithrin (PFT)-m, which has the potential to inhibit HSP70 function and autophagy, both of which participate in TRAIL resistance in cancer cells. Among the four humanpancreatic cancer cell lines tested, MiaPaca-2, Panc-1, and BxPC-3 cells showed varying sensitivities to TRAIL. In MiaPaca-2 and Panc-1 cells, knockdown of HSP70 or beclin-1, the latter an autophagy-related molecule, by RNA interference augmented TRAIL-induced antitumor effects, decreasing cell viability, and increasing apoptosis. On the basis of these findings, we next determined whether the TRAIL-induced antitumor effects could be augmented by its combination with PFT-m. The combination of TRAIL plus PFT-m significantly decreased the viability and colony-forming ability ofMiaPaca-2 andPanc-1 cells comparedwith cells treatedwith either agent alone.When applied alone, PFT-m increasedAnnexinVÃ¾ cells in both caspase-dependent and -independentmanners. It also promotedTRAIL-induced apoptosis and arrested cancer cell growth. Furthermore, PFT-m antagonizedTRAILassociated NF-kB activation in cancer cells. In a xenograft mouse model, combination therapy significantly inhibitedMiaPaca-2 tumor growth compared with treatment with either agent alone. The results of this study suggest protective roles for HSP70 and autophagy in TRAIL resistance in pancreatic cancer cells and suggest that PFT-m is a promising agent for use in therapies intended to enhance the antitumor effects of TRAIL. Mol Cancer Ther; 12(4); 341â€“51. 2013 AACR. Introduction Members of the TNF cytokine family, such as TNF-a and the Fas ligand, play important roles in inflammation and immunity (1). However, their use in anticancer therapy is limited because they cause severe cytotoxicity to normal cells. In contrast, TRAIL, a member of the TNF superfamily, can induce apoptosis in cancer cells while causing almost no cytotoxicity to normal cells (2). Therefore, TRAIL has been applied for several clinical trials (3, 4). TRAIL binds to death receptors (DR) and activates caspases, leading to apoptosis. However, some cancer cells acquire TRAIL resistance (5). The binding of TRAIL to death receptors activates NF-kB, PKC, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and AKT signaling (6, 7), thereby promoting cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance. Notably, activation of NF-kB signaling is an important TRAIL resistance mechanism (6, 8). Indeed, combination therapy with TRAIL plus NF-kB inhibitors has been reported to be a promising treatment strategy (9â€“11). Cancer cells acquire therapy resistance through a variety of mechanisms. One is increased expression of HSP70 (12). In contrast to the very low level in unstressed normal cells, HSP70 expression is rapidly increased in response to various stresses (13, 14). Importantly, increased expression of HSP70 in cancer cells has been reported to be associated with malignant features and poor prognosis in patients with cancer (15). Autophagy, meanwhile, has received much attention as a mechanism of therapy resistance in cancer cells. Its fundamental role in cells is cytoprotection under starvation and stress conditions (16), but this protective function can render cancer cells therapyresistant (17). Indeed,many reports suggest that inhibition of autophagy in cancer cells can restore their susceptibility to anticancer therapy (18â€“20). Recently, we reported that autophagy inhibits apoptosis of human prostate and breast cancer cells treatedwith an innate adjuvant receptor ligand (21, 22). These lines of evidence suggest that HSP70 and autophagy are promising targets for therapies intended to enhance TRAIL-induced antitumor effects, something that has not yet been fully investigated. Pifithrin (PFT)-m (2-phenylethynesulfonamide)was initially identified as a small-molecule inhibitor of p53 binding to mitochondria (23).

In addition, it induces altered autophagy, leading to inhibition of the later autophagic pathway. Furthermore, PFT-m inhibits the degradation of IkBa, resulting in inhibition of the NF-kB pathway. This information led us to test the possibility that PFT-m enhances TRAIL-induced antitumor effects in human pancreatic cancer. In this study, after confirming that HSP70 and autophagy play protective roles in TRAIL-induced antitumor effects, we showed that the combination of TRAIL and PFT-m decreased the viability and colony-forming ability of pancreatic cancer cells and increased their cell death. Using a xenograft mouse model, we also showed that the combination therapy significantly decreased pancreatic tumor growth as compared with treatment with either agent alone. These results suggest that PFT-m is a promising enhancer of TRAIL-induced antitumor effects on human pancreatic cancer. Materials and Methods",2013,
