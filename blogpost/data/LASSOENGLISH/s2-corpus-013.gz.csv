Computational prediction of microRNAs in marine bacteria of the genus Thalassospira,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key players in regulation of gene expression at post-transcription level in eukaryotic cells. MiRNAs have been intensively studied in plants, animals and viruses. The investigations of bacterial miRNAs have gained less attention, except for the recent studies on miRNAs derived from Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 and Escherichia coli DH10B. In this study, high-throughput sequencing approach was employed to investigate the miRNA population in bacteria of the genus Thalassospira using both the miRDeep2 and CID-miRNA methods. A total of 984 putative miRNAs were identified in 9 species of the genus Thalassospira using both miRDeep and CID-miRNA analyses. Fifty seven conserved putative miRNAs were found in different species of the genus Thalassospira, and up to 6 miRNAs were found to be present at different locations in the T. alkalitolerans JCM 18968T, T. lucentensis QMT2T and T. xianhensis P-4T. None of the putative miRNAs was found to share sequence to the reported miRNAs in E. coli DH10B and S. mutans ATCC 25175. The findings provide a comprehensive list of computationally identified miRNAs in 9 bacterial species of the genus Thalassospira and addressed the existing knowledge gap on the presence of miRNAs in the Thalassospira genomes.",2019,PLoS ONE
"Chaxapeptin, a Lasso Peptide from Extremotolerant Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii Strain C58 from the Hyperarid Atacama Desert.","Lasso peptides are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that possess a unique ""lariat knot"" structural motif. Genome mining-targeted discovery of new natural products from microbes obtained from extreme environments has led to the identification of a gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of a new lasso peptide, designated as chaxapeptin 1, in the genome of Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii strain C58 isolated from the Atacama Desert. Subsequently, 1 was isolated and characterized using high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The lasso nature of 1 was confirmed by calculating its nuclear Overhauser effect restraint-based solution structure. Chaxapeptin 1 displayed a significant inhibitory activity in a cell invasion assay with human lung cancer cell line A549.",2015,The Journal of organic chemistry
Hybrid Single Node Genetic Programming for Symbolic Regression,"This paper presents a first step of our research on designing an effective and efficient GP-based method for symbolic regression. First, we propose three extensions of the standard Single Node GP, namely 1 a selection strategy for choosing nodes to be mutated based on depth and performance of the nodes, 2 operators for placing a compact version of the best-performing graph to the beginning and to the end of the population, respectively, and 3 a local search strategy with multiple mutations applied in each iteration. All the proposed modifications have been experimentally evaluated on five symbolic regression benchmarks and compared with standard GP and SNGP. The achieved results are promising showing the potential of the proposed modifications to improve the performance of the SNGP algorithm. We then propose two variants of hybrid SNGP utilizing a linear regression technique, LASSO, to improve its performance. The proposed algorithms have been compared to the state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods that also make use of the linear regression techniques on four real-world benchmarks. The results show the hybrid SNGP algorithms are at least competitive with or better than the compared methods.",2016,Trans. Comput. Collect. Intell.
Low sample size and regression: A Monte Carlo approach,"This article performs simulations with different small samples considering the regression techniques of OLS, Jackknife, Bootstrap, Lasso and Robust Regression in order to stablish the best approach in terms of lower bias and statistical significance with a pre-specified data generating process -DGP-. The methodology consists of a DGP with 5 variables and 1 constant parameter which was regressed among the simulations with a set of random normally distributed variables considering samples sizes of 6, 10, 20 and 500. Using the expected values discriminated by each sample size, the accuracy of the estimators was calculated in terms of the relative bias for each technique. The results indicate that Jackknife approach is more suitable for lower sample sizes as it was stated by Speed (1994), Bootstrap approach reported to be sensitive to a lower sample size indicating that it might not be suitable for stablish significant relationships in the regressions. The Monte Carlo simulations also reflected that when a significant relationship is found in small samples, this relationship will also tend to remain significant when the sample size is increased.",2019,
Bayesian regularization in regression models for survival data,"This thesis is concerned with the development of flexible continuous-time survival models based on the accelerated failure time (AFT) model for the survival time and the Cox relative risk (CRR) model for the hazard rate. The flexibility concerns on the one hand the extension of the predictor to take into account simultaneously for a variety of different forms of covariate effects. On the other hand, the often too restrictive parametric assumptions about the survival distribution are replaced by semiparametric approaches that allow very flexible shapes of survival distribution. We use the Bayesian methodology for inference. The arising problems, like e. g. the penalization of high-dimensional linear covariate effects, the smoothing of nonlinear effects as well as the smoothing of the baseline survival distribution, are solved with the application of regularization priors tailored for the respective demand. 
The considered expansion of the two survival model classes enables to deal with various challenges arising in practical analysis of survival data. For example the models can deal with high-dimensional feature spaces (e. g. gene expression data), they facilitate feature selection from the whole set or a subset of the available covariates and enable the simultaneous modeling of any type of nonlinear covariate effects for covariates that should always be included in the model. The option of the nonlinear modeling of covariate effects as well as the semiparametric modeling of the survival time distribution enables furthermore also a visual inspection of the linearity assumptions about the covariate effects or accordingly parametric assumptions about the survival time distribution. 
In this thesis it is shown, how the p>n paradigm, feature relevance, semiparametric inference for functional effect forms and the semiparametric inference for the survival distribution can be treated within a unified Bayesian framework. Due the option to control the amount of regularization of the considered priors for the linear regression coefficients, there is no need to distinguish conceptionally between the cases p n. To accomplish the desired regularization, the regression coefficients are associated with shrinkage, selection or smoothing priors. Since the utilized regularization priors all facilitate a hierarchical representation, the resulting modular prior structure, in combination with adequate independence assumptions for the prior parameters, enables to establish a unified framework and the possibility to construct efficient MCMC sampling schemes for joint shrinkage, selection and smoothing in flexible classes of survival models. The Bayesian formulation enables therefore the simultaneous estimation of all parameters involved in the models as well as prediction and uncertainty statements about model specification. 
The presented methods are inspired from the flexible and general approach for structured additive regression (STAR) for responses from an exponential family and CRR-type survival models. Such systematic and flexible extensions are in general not available for AFT models. An aim of this work is to extend the class of AFT models in order to provide such a rich class of models as resulting from the STAR approach, where the main focus relies on the shrinkage of linear effects, the selection of covariates with linear effects together with the smoothing of nonlinear effects of continuous covariates as representative of a nonlinear modeling. Combined are in particular the Bayesian lasso, the Bayesian ridge and the Bayesian NMIG (a kind of spike-and-slab prior) approach to regularize the linear effects and the P-spline approach to regularize the smoothness of the nonlinear effects and the baseline survival time distribution. To model a flexible error distribution for the AFT model, the parametric assumption for the baseline error distribution is replaced by the assumption of a finite Gaussian mixture distribution. For the special case of specifying one basis mixture component the estimation problem essentially boils down to estimation of log-normal AFT model with STAR predictor. In addition, the existing class of CRR survival models with STAR predictor, where also baseline hazard rate is approximated by a P-spline, is expanded to enable the regularization of the linear effects with the mentioned priors, which broadens further the area of application of this rich class of CRR models. Finally, the combined shrinkage, selection and smoothing approach is also introduced to the semiparametric version of the CRR model, where the baseline hazard is unspecified and inference is based on the partial likelihood. 
Besides the extension of the two survival model classes the different regularization properties of the considered shrinkage and selection priors are examined. The developed methods and algorithms are implemented in the public available software BayesX and in R-functions and the performance of the methods and algorithms is extensively tested by simulation studies and illustrated through three real world data sets.",2013,
Individual Classification of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease with Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful non-invasive method to study white matter integrity, and is sensitive to detect differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Diffusion MRI may be able to contribute towards reliable diagnosis of AD. We used diffusion MRI to classify AD patients (N=77), and controls (N=173). We use different methods to extract information from the diffusion MRI data. First, we use the voxelwise diffusion tensor measures that have been skeletonised using tract based spatial statistics. Second, we clustered the voxel-wise diffusion measures with independent component analysis (ICA), and extracted the mixing weights. Third, we determined structural connectivity between Harvard Oxford atlas regions with probabilistic tractography, as well as graph measures based on these structural connectivity graphs. Classification performance for voxel-wise measures ranged between an AUC of 0.888, and 0.902. The ICAclustered measures ranged between an AUC of 0.893, and 0.920. The AUC for the structural connectivity graph was 0.900, while graph measures based upon this graph ranged between an AUC of 0.531, and 0.840. All measures combined with a sparse group lasso resulted in an AUC of 0.896. Overall, fractional anisotropy clustered into ICA components was the best performing measure. These findings may be useful for future incorporation of diffusion MRI into protocols for AD classification, or as a starting point for early detection of AD using diffusion MRI.",2017,Alzheimer's & Dementia
"Microbulbifer agarilyticus sp. nov. and Microbulbifer thermotolerans sp. nov., agar-degrading bacteria isolated from deep-sea sediment.","Nine agar-degrading strains, designated JAMB A3T, JAMB A7, JAMB A24, JAMB A33, JAMB A94T, JAMM 0654, JAMM 0793, JAMM 1327 and JAMM 1340, were isolated from deep-sea sediment in Suruga Bay and Sagami Bay and off Kagoshima, Japan. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the strains were found to be closely affiliated with members of the genera Microbulbifer and Thalassomonas. The hybridization values for DNA-DNA relatedness between two of these strains and Microbulbifer reference strains were significantly lower than that accepted as the phylogenetic definition of a species. On the basis of their distinct taxonomic characteristics, six of the isolated strains represent two novel species of the genus Microbulbifer, for which the names Microbulbifer agarilyticus sp. nov. (type strain JAMB A3T =JCM 14708T =DSM 19200T) and Microbulbifer thermotolerans sp. nov.

The Evolution and Functional Diversification of the Deubiquitinating Enzyme Superfamily,"Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules are attached to and removed from cellular proteins in a dynamic and highly regulated manner. Deubiquitinating enzymes are critical to this process, and the genetic catalogue of deubiquitinating enzymes expanded greatly over the course of evolution. Extensive functional redundancy has been noted among the 93 members of the human deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) superfamily. This is especially true of genes that were generated by duplication (termed paralogs) as they often retain considerable sequence similarity. Because complete redundancy in systems should be eliminated by selective pressure, we theorized that many overlapping DUBs must have significant and unique spatiotemporal roles that can be evaluated inanevolutionary context.Wehavedeterminedtheevolutionaryhistoryof theentire classofdeubiquitinatingenzymes, including the sequence and means of duplication for all paralogous pairs. To establish their uniqueness, we have investigated cell-type specificity in developmental and adult contexts, and have investigated the coemergence of substrates from the same duplication events. Our analysis has revealed examples of DUB gene subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, and nonfunctionalization.",2017,Genome Biology and Evolution
Learning Sparse Dynamical Systems from a Single Sample Trajectory,"This paper addresses the problem of identifying sparse linear time-invariant (LTI) systems from a single sample trajectory generated by the system dynamics. We introduce a Lasso-like estimator for the parameters of the system, taking into account their sparse nature. Assuming that the system is stable, or that it is equipped with an initial stabilizing controller, we provide sharp finite-time guarantees on the accurate recovery of both the sparsity structure and the parameter values of the system. In particular, we show that the proposed estimator can correctly identify the sparsity pattern of the system matrices with high probability, provided that the length of the sample trajectory exceeds a threshold. Furthermore, we show that this threshold scales polynomially in the number of nonzero elements in the system matrices, but logarithmically in the system dimensions â€” this improves on existing sample complexity bounds for the sparse system identification problem. We further extend these results to obtain sharp bounds on the â„“âˆž-norm of the estimation error and show how different properties of the systemâ€”such as its stability level and mutual incoherencyâ€”affect this bound. Finally, an extensive case study on power systems is presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed estimation method.",2019,2019 IEEE 58th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)
"Irregular schooling behavior and abandonment of mimicry by the Sabertooth Blenny (Blenniidae) in Cabo Pulmo National Park, Gulf of California, Mexico","Plagiotremus azaleus (the Sabertooth Blenny; Fig. 1a) is an obligate scale-eating blenny (Hobson 1968) endemic to and widespread in the tropical eastern Pacific. Like many members of Tribe Nemophini (Blenniidae), P. azaleus typically relies on mimicry to gain access to potential prey fishes (Smith-Vaniz 1976). Throughout its range, the model of this aggressive mimic is the initial phase of Thalassoma lucasanum (the Cortez Rainbow Wrasse). At several sites throughout the Gulf of California, we have observed P. azaleus in its typical mimic capacity, resembling its model in both appearance and behavior. On these reefs, P. azaleus is significantly outnumbered by T. lucasanum, with an average of more than 160 wrasses per blenny (2009 belt transect survey data). Distinguishing between the two is not difficult as the blennies are more slender and utilize anguilliform rather than labriform swimming, as in the wrasses. This typical difference in densities is not surprising given the necessary prevalence of the model and scarcity of the mimic in evolutionarily stable aggressive mimicry systems. In summer and fall 2010, at reef sites in Cabo Pulmo National Park (CPNP), we observed several aggregations of P. azaleus ranging in number from 10 to 20 individuals and one group of well over 100 blennies (Fig. 1b). In contrast to our observations elsewhere, these blennies greatly outnumbered T. lucasanum, did not school with it, and did not display the dark coloration typical of individuals engaged in mimicry (Fig. 1). Instead, blennies from these groups aggressively attacked large fishes, including top predators such as Mycteroperca rosacea (Leopard Grouper) and Lutjanus novemfaciatus (Dog Snapper), in such large numbers and with such ferocity that they affected the behaviors and movements of these much larger fishes, displacing them from the area. How a species that typically relies on mimicry can maintain such high local abundances without resembling its model is paradoxical. CPNP has been closed to fishing for 15 years and has some of the highest densities of reef fishes in the tropical eastern Pacific (2009 belt transect data). Perhaps these local abundances of potential prey allow for the large numbers of P. azaleus that we observed, even when they seemingly no longer utilize mimicry to gain access to food resources.",2010,Coral Reefs
Time course of markers of tissue repair after ablation of atrial fibrillation and their relation to left atrial structural changes and clinical ablation outcome.,"BACKGROUND
Radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) creates left atrial (LA) tissue damage with a subsequent healing process. We sought to prospectively assess the time course of biomarkers of tissue repair after ablation and to evaluate their association with clinical variables.


METHODS
30 consecutive patients (57.9 Â± 1.7 yrs, 63% males) with paroxysmal AF underwent a CARTO-guided LA circumferential ablation, Lasso-guided segmental pulmonary vein isolation and ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGF-Î²1), both key regulators of tissue repair, and the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), reflecting collagen synthesis, were determined in blood samples before and 6h, 1, 2, 7, 30, 90 and 180 days post-ablation.


RESULTS
All markers showed a significant ablation-induced up-regulation (MMP-9: 1.8 Â± 0.1-fold, TGF-Î²1: 2.4 Â± 0.4-fold, PIIINP: 1.3 Â± 0.1-fold). MMP-9 was significantly up-regulated until day 90, TGF-Î²1 only on day 2. PIIINP increased from day 2 to 7. The area under the curve (AUC) of MMP-9 and TGF-Î²1 correlated with the ablation-induced reduction of LA volume (both p<0.05). The AUC of MMP-9 was additionally associated with the amount of radiofrequency energy delivered during ablation (p < 0.05). At 12 months of follow-up 57% of patients were free of AF off antiarrhythmic drugs. The AUC of PIIINP independently predicted recurrent AF (p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Markers of healing showed a significant up-regulation after AF ablation detectable for up to 90 days. A more pronounced up-regulation of MMP-9 or TGF-Î²1 is associated with a greater reduction of LA size. High PIIINP levels after ablation predict a poor ablation outcome.",2011,International journal of cardiology
Fusion of Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data for Landscape Visual Quality Assessment,"Landscape visual quality is an important factor associated with daily experiences and influences our quality of life. In this work, the authors present a method of fusing airborne hyperspectral and mapping light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data for landscape visual quality assessment. From the fused hyperspectral and LiDAR data, classification and depth images at any location can be obtained, enabling physical features such as land-cover properties and openness to be quantified. The relationship between physical features and human landscape preferences is learned using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The proposed method is applied to the hyperspectral and LiDAR datasets provided for the 2013 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest. The results showed that the proposed method successfully learned a human perception model that enables the prediction of landscape visual quality at any viewpoint for a given demographic used for training. This work is expected to contribute to automatic landscape assessment and optimal spatial planning using remote sensing data.",2014,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing
Variable Selection in Logistic Regression Model,"Variable selection is one of the most important problems in pattern recognition. In linear regression model, there are many methods can solve this problem, such as Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and many improved LASSO methods, but there are few variable selection methods in generalized linear models. We study the variable selection problem in logistic regression model. We propose a new variable selection method-the logistic elastic net, prove that it has grouping effect which means that the strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The logistic elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the LASSO is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the case when p is more larger than n. The advantage and effectiveness of this method are demonstrated by real leukemia data and a simulation study.",2015,Chinese Journal of Electronics
A Multivariate Adaptive Stochastic Search Method for Dimensionality Reduction in Classification T,"High-dimensional classification has become an increasingly important problem. In this paper, we propose a â€œMultivariate Adaptive Stochastic Searchâ€ (MASS) approach which first reduces the dimension of the data space and then applies a standard classification method to the reduced space. One key advantage of MASS is that it automatically adjusts to mimic variable selection type methods, such as the Lasso, variable combination methods, such as PCA, or methods that combine these two approaches. The adaptivity of MASS allows it to perform well in situations where pure variable selection or variable combination methods fail. Another major advantage of our approach is that MASS can accurately project the data into very lowdimensional non-linear, as well as linear, spaces. MASS uses a stochastic search algorithm to select a handful of optimal projection directions from a large number of random directions in each iteration. We provide some theoretical justification for MASS and demonstrate its strengths on an extensive range of simulation studies and real world data sets by comparing it to many classical and modern classification methods.",2009,
"Reproductive phenology across the lunar cycle: parental decisions, offspring responses, and consequences for reef fish.","Most organisms reproduce in a dynamic environment, and life-history theory predicts that this can favor the evolution of strategies that capitalize on good times and avoid bad times. When offspring experience these environmental changes, fitness can depend strongly upon environmental conditions at birth and at later life stages. Consequently, fitness will be influenced by the reproductive decisions of parents (i.e., birthdate effects) and developmental decisions (e.g., adaptive plasticity) of their offspring. We explored the consequences of these decisions using a highly iteroparous coral reef fish (the sixbar wrasse, Thalassoma hardwicke), and in a system where both parental and offspring environments vary with the lunar cycle. We tested the hypotheses that (1) reproductive patterns and offspring survival vary across the lunar cycle and (2) offspring exhibit adaptive plasticity in development time. We evaluated temporal variation in egg production from Feb-June 2017, and corresponding larval developmental histories (inferred from otolith microstructure) of successful settlers and surviving juveniles that were spawned during that same period. We documented lunar-cyclic variation in egg production (most eggs were spawned at the new moon). This pattern was at odds with the distribution of birthdates of settlers and surviving juveniles -- most individuals that successfully survived to settlement and older stages were born during the full moon. Consequently, the probability of survival across the larval stage was greatest for offspring born close to the full moon, when egg production was at its lowest. Offspring also exhibited plasticity in developmental duration, adjusting their age at settlement to settle during darker portions of the lunar cycle than expected given their birthdate. Offspring born near the new moon tended to be older and larger at settlement, and these traits conveyed a strong fitness advantage (i.e., a carry-over effect) through to adulthood. We speculate that these effects (1) are shaped by a dynamic landscape of risk and reward determined by moonlight, which differentially influences adults and offspring, and (2) can explain the evolution of extreme iteroparity in sixbars.",2020,Ecology
"Rivulus torrenticola n. sp. (Actinopterygii: Cyprinodontiformes: Rivulidae), a new killifish from highlands in the Guyana shield","Rivulus torrenticola n. sp. is described from small tributaries of the Kamarang River, which itself is a left bank tributary of the Mazaruni River in Guyana. R. torrenticola is a small, non-annual species. Males are distinguished from other Rivulus spp. by their long dorsal, anal and pelvic fins, by their truncate caudal fin and by their two longitudinal, dark lines on the body. Females have rounded fins and dark pigment on the body. They lack a so-called Rivulus-spot. R. torrenticola is reminiscent of R. gransabanae Lasso et al., 1992, with which it was likely encountered around Imbamadai.",2000,
Ultrahigh Dimensional Feature Screening via RKHS Embeddings,"Feature screening is a key step in handling ultrahigh dimensional data sets that are ubiquitous in modern statistical problems. Over the last decade, convex relaxation based approaches (e.g., Lasso/sparse additive model) have been extensively developed and analyzed for feature selection in high dimensional regime. But in the ultrahigh dimensional regime, these approaches suer from several problems, both computationally and statistically. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Hilbert space embedding based approach to independence screening for ultrahigh dimensional data sets. The proposed approach is model-free (i.e., no model assumption is made between response and predictors) and could handle non-standard (e.g., graphs) and multivariate outputs directly. We establish the sure screening property of the proposed approach in the ultrahigh dimensional regime, and experimentally demonstrate its advantages and superiority over other approaches on several synthetic and real data sets.",2013,
Anatomical Arthroscopic Anterior Talofibular Ligament Repair and Reconstruction Using a Free Tendon,"Arthroscopic techniques for anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) repair and reconstruction have been developed in recent years. We simultaneously performed anatomical arthroscopic ATFL repair and reconstruction using a free tendon graft. The ATFL remnant is carefully dissected only at the footprint of the superior limb of the ATFL, and a bone tunnel is created on each side of the fibula and talus. A soft suture anchor with 2 sets of threads is inserted into the fibular tunnel. One set of threads is used to grab the ATFL remnant via a lasso-loop technique, whereas the other set of threads is used to introduce the ATFL graft. The graft is first fixed with a screw in the talar tunnel. Subsequently, the ATFL remnant and the graft are tightened simultaneously by pulling the 2 sets of suture anchor threads at the fibular tunnel and are fixed with a screw. This technique provides the possible advantages of remnant preservation and promotion of load sharing by the repaired ATFL remnant and the reconstructed ATFL graft.",2020,Arthroscopy Techniques
Cross-comparison of inference methods for Gaussian Graphical Model Bachelor â€™ s Project Mathematics,"In Gaussian graphical modeling statistics and graph theory go hand in hand. With applications in many fields this widely applied technique is used to estimate the partial correlations among variables of a given dataset. This thesis covers four of the popular approaches within Gaussian graphical modeling, the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, the Lasso (inclusion of the `1term), the shrinkage and the bootstrap approach. These four methods will be cross compared on the basis of several tests. These tests cover the accuracy of the estimation, the computational speed and the user friendliness of each method. The first test is based on randomly generated datasets of which the true partial correlations are know. Every tested method is then applied to two datasets extracted from the R package â€™GeneNetâ€™. In the last section of this thesis it is concluded that, despite a high demand on the computational cost, the Lasso approach supplies the user with the most accurate estimation. However it has to be noted that it is suspected that the shrinkage approach did not achieve its full potential due to mistakes made along the journey of programming.",2018,
"Stratigraphy, palynology, and conchostracans of a Lower Cretaceous sequence at the CaÃ±adÃ³n CalcÃ¡reo locality, Extra-Andean central Patagonia: age and palaeoenvironmental significance","Abstract The first palynologic record in a Lower Cretaceous sequence at the Canadon Calcareo locality of Extra-Andean central Patagonia is presented. It contributes a more precise chronology and palaeoenvironmental characterization of the sequence. The conchostracan faunal records support the palynologic results. Sedimentary environments are studied in relation to a tectogenetic development model. Detailed measurement of stratigraphic/sedimentologic sections in the field was complemented by sampling for palynology, conchostracans and sedimentary facies/microfacies analysis. The depositional environment is lacustrine/palustrine in the lower part, grading to fluvial. The middle and upper sections of the unit are fluvial and characterized by prevailing sandstones, conglomerates and tuffs. Dominant genera of the palynoflora are Classopollis and Callialasporites , with an incipient presence of Cyclusphaera . The prevalence of the thermophilous genus Classopollis indicates warm climatic conditions, and the high frequency and diversity of trilete spores, corresponding to a hygrophile vegetation of ferns and bryophytes, indicates locally humid conditions. The fauna of conchostracans identified is composed of species of the genera Nemestheria ( Zhestheria ), Pseudestherites , Euestheria ?, and probably Congestheriella . A Valanginian age is inferred for the middle part of the sequence.",2009,Cretaceous Research
Using Exploratory Data Mining to Identify Important Correlates of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury Frequency,"Objective: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) has been linked to many adverse outcomes, with more frequent NSSI increasing the likelihood of impairment, severity, and more serious self-harming behavior (e.g., suicidality). Despite the determined importance of NSSI frequency in understanding the severity of oneâ€™s behavior, there is still a need to identify which constructs may be influential in predicting frequency. The current study aimed to fill this gap by identifying which correlates are most important in relation to NSSI frequency through 2 exploratory data mining methods. Method: Seven hundred twelve undergraduate students with a history of NSSI completed self-report measures of NSSI behavior, suicidality, cognitiveâ€“affective deficits, and psychopathology symptomology. Results: Both exploratory data mining methodsâ€”lasso regression and random forestsâ€”demonstrated number of NSSI methods to be the factor with the most importance in relation to lifetime NSSI frequency. Once this variable was removed, suicide plan and depressive symptomology were significant correlates across methods. Conclusions: The current findings support the literature concerning the relationship between NSSI frequency and NSSI methods but also implicate suicide plans, an often-overlooked factor, and depression in NSSI severity.",2018,Psychology of Violence
Field attempt to assess the mating competitiveness of sterile males produced by crossing 2 member species of the Anopheles gambiae complex.,"In laboratory experiments sterile males produced by crossing member species of the Anopheles gambiae complex competed very successfully with normal males for normal females and the latter when mated with sterile males laid sterile eggs.A field trial was arranged in a small isolated village near Bobo-Dioulasso, Upper Volta; the trial took place at the end of the rainy season against a declining population of species A. Sterile males were produced from the cross between species B males and An. melas females; this cross yielded an F(1) generation mainly composed of sterile males with a sporadic occurrence of a sometimes significant proportion of females which were reproductively normal.The F(1) generation was reared to pupae and these were released into existing breeding places and later from artificial containers.Some 300 000 pupae were so released over a period of 2 months and adult collections were made periodically from inside houses and from outside shelters after releases started. Of the males caught, 75% proved to be sterile while nearly 6% of normal-looking ovipositions failed to hatch. However 2.5% of them proved to be from hybrid females and not from species A females. In control villages, 1.35% of normal-looking ovipositions did not hatch.It was concluded from this field trial that the sterile males were not mating on any significant scale with the natural species A females. This could have been due to a number of factors but the most important is considered to be an ethological one-a mating barrier preventing mating between introduced sterile males and natural females. This is strongly expressed under natural conditions but not operative in the limited confines of a cage. The use of a cross between two species against a third species may well have enhanced this barrier.",1970,Bulletin of the World Health Organization
Fast local linear regression with anchor regularization,"Regression is an important task in machine learning and data mining. It has several applications in various domains, including finance, biomedical, and computer vision. Recently, network Lasso, which estimates local models by making clusters using the network information, was proposed and its superior performance was demonstrated. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective local model training algorithm called the fast anchor regularized local linear method (FALL). More specifically, we train a local model for each sample by regularizing it with precomputed anchor models. The key advantage of the proposed algorithm is that we can obtain a closed-form solution with only matrix multiplication; additionally, the proposed algorithm is easily interpretable, fast to compute and parallelizable. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FALL compares favorably in terms of accuracy with the state-of-the-art network Lasso algorithm with significantly smaller training time (two orders of magnitude).",2020,ArXiv

Distribution of spores and pollen grains in the Upper Gondwana strata of India,"Abstract The distributional pattern of the dispersed spores and pollen grains in the Upper Gondwana strata of the Salt Range (West Pakistan), Rajmahal Series (India), Andigama shales (Ceylon), and Jabalpur Series (India), ranging from Liassic to Lower Cretaceous, has been given. Six distinct palynological assemblages (see Fig.2, Aâ€“F) have been biostratigraphically studied and analysed. Each assemblage seems to be quite characteristic for its associated horizon and is easily distinguishable mostly at generic level. The Salt Range assemblage (Liassic) is dominated by Classopollis and Perinopollenites whereas the Rajmahal assemblages (Middle-Upper Jurassic) possess mostly cycadophytic and non-saccate pollen grains, together with a representation of pteridophytic spores. In the assemblage of Andigama Shale (Uppermost Jurassic), pteridophytic spores with a dominance of Contignisporites cooksonii constitute the most striking feature. The palynological changes in the Jabalpur Series (Lower Cretaceous) as compared to the Jurassic assemblages are distinct and have been discussed later on. From the preliminary and broader comparative analysis of different assemblages incorporated in this paper, it seems possible that palynological studies on the Upper Gondwana sediments of India can be successfully applied for finer separation of the strata.",1970,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
Graph structure inference for high-throughput genomic data,"Graph Structured Inference For High-Throughput Genomic Data Hui Zhou Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies enable us to study a large number of biomarkers and use their information collectively. Based on highthroughput experiments, there are many genome-wide networks constructed to characterize the complex physical or functional interactions between the biomarkers. To identify outcome-related biomarkers, it is often advantageous to make use of the known relational structure, because graph structured inference introduces smoothness and reduces complexity in modelling. In this dissertation, we propose models for high-dimensional epigenetic and genomic data that incorporate the network structure and update the network structure based on empirical evidence. In the first part of this dissertation, we propose a penalized conditional logistic regression model for high dimensional DNA methylation data. DNA methylation of CpG sites within genes are often correlated and the number of CpG sites typically far outnumbers the sample size. The new penalty function combines the truncated lasso penalty and a graph fuse-lasso penalty to induce parsimonious and consistent models, and to incorporate the CpG sites network structure without introducing extra bias. An efficient minorization-maximization algorithm that utilizes difference of convex programming and alternating direction method of multipliers is presented. Extensive simulations demonstrated superior performance of the proposed method compared to several existing methods in both model selection consistency and parameter estimation accuracy. We also applied the proposed method to a matched case-control breast invasive carcinoma methylation data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), generated from both Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 (HM27) and HumanMethylation450 (HM450) Beadchip. The proposed method identified several outcome-related CpG sites that have been missed by the existing methods. In the latter part of this dissertation, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical graphstructured model that integrates a priori network information with empirical evidence. Empirical data may suggest modifications to the given network structure, which could lead to new and interesting biological findings when the prior knowledge on the graphical structure among the variables is limited or partial. We present the full hierarchical model along with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling inference procedure. Using both simulations and brain aging gene pathway data, we showed that the new method can identify discrepancy between data and a prior known graph structure and suggest modifications and updates. Motivated by methylation and gene expression data, the two models we propose in this thesis make use of the available structure in the data and produce better inferential results. The proposed methods can be applied to a wider range of problems.",2014,
Oribatid Mites from Marine Littoral and Freshwater Habitats in India with Remarks on World Species of Thalassozetes (Acari: Oribatida),"This work deals with 4 species of oribatid mites found in marine coastal and semi-aquatic, freshwater habitats during a flood in India. Species of the small oribatid mite genus, Thalassozetes (Ameronothroidea: Selenoribatidae), mostly inhabit and are typical of marine littoral zones in the tropics and subtropics. In the present paper, we propose a newly revised diagnosis for this genus, and describe a new species, Thalassozetes tenuisetosus sp. nov., collected from marine coastal areas of western India (Goa, Arabian Sea). The description is based on adult and juvenile specimens. A diagnostic key to adults of known species of Thalassozetes in the world is provided along with a summary of their geographical distributions. In addition, supplementary descriptions of 3 known species, Peloribates kaszabi Mahunka, 1988, Scheloribates latipes (C. L. Koch, 1844), and Pergalumna cf. foveolata Hammer, 1973 found among weeds and sediments of the Karamana River of Trivananthapuram (Trivandrum), Kerala, India, during a flood are given with respective illustrations. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/49.6/839.pdf.",2010,Zoological Studies
Les Ã©conomies urbaines subsahariennes et le problÃ¨me de la mobilisation de ressources via le secteur informel,"Based on the recent studies of the local economies in Western Africa and on survey data about the informal sector of Bobo-Dioulasso city (Burkina Faso), this work aimed to contribute to the reflection on the mobilisation of the fiscal resources in the average cities for financing city development. It confirms the marginality of local budgets in regard to the rawlocal product and the communal expenditure which increased with the decentralisation. Thismarginality of local budgets is mainly the consequence of the ineffectiveness of the fiscal administrations in the informal sector. Actually the informal sector is very heterogeneous anddifficult to encircle compared to the modern one. But, it's possible to overcome this difficultyas proved by typological analyses of the informal sector â€“ realised by means of the method ofhierarchical classification coupled with an analysis of multiple correspondences â€“ because inthis sector there are homogeneous subgroups for which an adequate policy of support or a fiscalone can be applied. Built for this occasion, the optimisation model gives a theoretical esquireto the problems of the taxability of micro-units. This model allows to analyse these problemsand to propose strategies of taxation of the informal units going in the direction of an adaptedfiscal policy. This model deserves to be completed and improved, by introducing for examplemechanisms of instigation, penalty or deterrence to enrich the analysis. (Full text in French)",2001,
Multivariate statistical methods for estimating grassland leaf area index and chlorophyll content using hyperspectral measurements,"Grassland habitat covers about one-quarter of the Earthâ€™s land surface, providing significant contribution to the worldâ€™s total agricultural production, plant biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. The advent of hyperspectral remote sensing and the future launch of planned spaceborne hyperspectral missions will open up new possibilities over conventional multispectral RS to better quantify grassland characteristics. Hyperspectral data, while rich in information, presents a challenge for analysis due to its high dimensionality and multicollinearity. This present study investigated three promising high dimensional multivariate regression models namely partial least squares regression (PLSR), regularization and shrinkage method Lasso, and nonparametric Random Forest (RF) regression, to estimate grassland leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll using field canopy hyperspectral measurements (n=185). For each regression model, three spectral transformations namely continuum-removal, firstderivative, and pseudo-absorbance were evaluated.",2015,
Investigation of Acute Toxicity and Neurotropic Properties of the Flowers' Dense Extracts of Tawny Daylily (hemerocallis Fulva L.) and Hybrid Daylily (hemerocallis Hybrida Var. Â«stella De OroÂ»),"INVESTIGATION OF ACUTE TOXICITY AND NEUROTROPIC PROPERTIES OF THE FLOWERS'Â  DENSE EXTRACTS OF TAWNY DAYLILY (HEMEROCALLIS FULVA L.) AND HYBRID DAYLILY (HEMEROCALLIS HYBRIDA VAR. Â«STELLA DE OROÂ») S. M. Marchyshyn 1 , O. V. Zarichanska 2 , S. Yu. Cholach 1 I. Horbachevsky Ternopil State Medical University 1 Vinnytsia National Memorial Medical University by M. I. Pyrohov 2 Introduction. Â In modern conditions almost no one person is able to avoid stressful situations that lead to manifestations of functional disorders of the central nervous system - neuroses. Anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances and disorder of emotional sphere due to the prevalence among the population gain significant measures. In accordance with the urgency of the problem, the search for safety and effective remedies for correction of mild neurosisâ€™ manifestations among the preparations of plant origin is promising. From the literature sources, it is known that preparations from flowers of Daylily genus plants ( Hemerocallis L.) show effects on the nervous system and are used in traditional medicine in China, Japan and North America for the treatment of depression, insomnia and other psycho-emotional disorders. Previously we performed a comprehensive phytochemical study of plant raw materials of two species of daylilies â€“ tawny daylily ( Hemerocallis fulva L.) and hybrid daylily ( Hemerocallis hybrida var. â€œStella De Oroâ€ ). Analysis of quantitative composition and qualitative content of biologically active substances of two investigated dayliliesâ€™ species demonstrates the appropriateness of the creation of phytosubstances on their base and investigation of phytosubstancesâ€™ pharmacological properties. The purpose of these studies was to determine the safety of thick extracts from flowers of tawny daylily and hybrid daylily, to establish the influence of extracts on behavioral responses and emotional state, depressive behavior and physical endurance of laboratory mice. Investigation methods. The investigation was conducted on 48 male white nonlinear mice weighing 18-25 grams, which were divided into 8 groups (n = 6): Group 1 â€“ intact control; 2-5 groups â€“ animals, injected with thick extracts from flowers of tawny daylily and hybrid daylily variety â€œ Stella De Oro â€ in the form of aqueous solutions intragastric at doses 100 and 250 mg / kg. 6-7 comparison groups received medication according to the behavioral model: imipramine (solution for injection â€œMelipramineâ€, Egis, Hungary) 25 mg / kg (for Porsoltâ€™s test of antidepressant activity); 2-etyltiobenzimidazole hydrobromide â€“ the active component of actoprotective drugs â€œBemitylâ€ and â€œMetaprotâ€ at dose 50 mg / kg (for test of actoprotective effect). To determine the effect of daylilies flowersâ€™ extracts on behavioral responses and emotional state of intact animals common open field test was used without medicinal preparationâ€™s control. Results and discussions. Investigation of acute toxicity has shown safety of both extracts samples â€“ at dose 5000 mg / kg these substances did not cause any symptoms of poisoning. In open field behavioral test extract from tawny daylilyâ€™s flowers in dose 100 mg / kg shown pronounce stimulating effect; extract from hybrid daylilyâ€™s flowers in dose 250 mg / kg elucidated sedative activity. In behavioral despairâ€™s test with immobilization the extract of hybrid daylilyâ€™s flowers in dose of 250 mg / kg shown distinct antidepressant properties, which are close to the level of activity of tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. Tawny daylily and hybrid daylily flowersâ€™ extracts at both investigated doses had no effect on physical endurance of mice in the forced swim test with a load, whereas reference-medication shown expressive actoprotective effect. Conclusions. The acute toxicity of the dense extracts from flowers of tawny daylily and hybrid daylily of â€œ Stella De Oro â€ variant has been determined for the first time; the investigated substances were assigned to the 5 th classof substancesâ€™ toxicity according to the classification of Hodge and Sterner (practically non-toxic substances â€“ LD 50 > 5000 mg/kg). The effect of investigated extracts on behavioral reactions and emotional condition, depressive behavior and physical endurance of laboratory mice has been defined using behavioral tests. Diverse and expressive influence of investigated thick extracts on central nervous system and physical endurance of laboratory mice has been elucidated. References Azymova Yu. E.

Online Hyperparameter Search Interleaved with Proximal Parameter Updates,"There is a clear need for efficient algorithms to tune hyperparameters for statistical learning schemes, since the commonly applied search methods (such as grid search with N-fold cross-validation) are inefficient and/or approximate. Previously existing algorithms that efficiently search for hyperparameters relying on the smoothness of the cost function cannot be applied in problems such as Lasso regression. 
In this contribution, we develop a hyperparameter optimization method that relies on the structure of proximal gradient methods and does not require a smooth cost function. Such a method is applied to Leave-one-out (LOO)-validated Lasso and Group Lasso to yield efficient, data-driven, hyperparameter optimization algorithms. 
Numerical experiments corroborate the convergence of the proposed method to a local optimum of the LOO validation error curve, and the efficiency of its approximations.",2020,ArXiv

Near-ideal behavior of compressed sensing algorithms,"Compressed sensing theory addresses the problem of recovering a nearly sparse signal from a noise-corrupted linear measurement of far smaller dimension. In some recent papers, it is shown that the LASSO algorithm exhibits near-ideal behavior, in the following sense: If x is a sparse signal, and if an estimate x-hat of x is found using LASSO, then the Euclidean norm of the residual error is bounded by a universal constant times the error achieved by an â€œoracleâ€ that knows the support set of x. The LASSO algorithm has been generalized in several directions such as the group LASSO, the sparse group LASSO, either without or with tree-structured overlapping groups, and most recently, the sorted LASSO. This raises the question as to which if any of these algorithms also exhibits near-ideal behavior. In this paper we present a unified theory by showing that any algorithm exhibits near-ideal behavior in the above sense, provided that three conditions are satisfied: (i) the norm used to define the sparsity index is â€œdecomposable,â€ (ii) the penalty norm that is minimized in an effort to enforce sparsity is gamma-decomposable, and (iii) a â€œcompressibility conditionâ€ in terms of a group restricted isometry property is satisfied. Our results imply that the group LASSO, and the sparse group LASSO (with some permissible overlap in the groups), as well as the sorted â„“1-norm minimization all exhibit near-ideal behavior. Explicit bounds on the residual error are derived that contain previously known results as special cases.",2014,53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control
The hydrocarbon biodegradation potential of Faroe-Shetland Channel bacterioplankton,"The Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC) is an important gateway for dynamic water exchange between the North Atlantic Ocean and the Nordic Seas. In recent years it has also become a frontier for deep-water oil exploration and petroleum production, which has raised the risk of oil pollution to local ecosystems and adjacent waterways. In order to better understand the factors that influence the biodegradation of spilled petroleum, a prerequisite has been recognized to elucidate the complex dynamics of microbial communities and their relationships to their ecosystem. This research project was a pioneering attempt to investigate the FSCâ€™s microbial community composition, its response and potential to degrade crude oil hydrocarbons under the prevailing regional temperature conditions. Three strategies were used to investigate this. Firstly, high throughput sequencing and 16S rRNA gene-based community profiling techniques were utilized to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of the FSC bacterioplankton. Monitoring proceeded over a period of 2 years and interrogated the multiple water masses flowing through the region producing 2 contrasting water cores: Atlantic (surface) and Nordic (subsurface). Results revealed microbial profiles more distinguishable based on water cores (rather than individual water masses) and seasonal variability patterns within each core. Secondly, the response of the microbial communities to crude oil was investigated in laboratory-based microcosms. Microbial communities from all water masses exhibited hydrocarbon biodegradation activity at average FSC temperatures (4Â°C), albeit with markedly delayed and potentially slower response in comparison to those exposed to moderate control temperatures (20Â°C). A collection of bacterial isolates, comprising of 230 FSC strains with putative hydrocarbonoclastic activity was created, which included psychrotolerant members belonging to the genera Marinobacter, Pseudoalteromonas, Cycloclasticus, Halomonas, Thalassolituus and Glaciecola. Lastly, a sophisticated molecular technique called DNA-based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) was used to directly target and identify hydrocarbon-degrading taxa that may not be easily amenable to cultivation. Using DNA-SIP, hydrocarbonoclastic FSC strains affiliated with the genera Phaeobacter and Lentibacter were identified, along with strains affiliated with known hydrocarbon-degraders from the genera Thalassolituus, Alcanivorax, Oleispira, Glaciecola, Marinobacter and Cycloclasticus. Correlating the findings from all three experiments, revealed that ~41% of the baseline FSC microbial community constituted bacteria affiliated to genera with hydrocarbon-degrading capacities. Their response to the presence of hydrocarbons, however, appeared to be largely influenced by temperature. This work is the first to establish a microbial baseline for the FSC and to investigate the microbial repose to crude oil in the water column of the region. Results are expected to contribute to the development of biotechnologies and oil-spill mitigation strategies tailored for the FSC region in the event of an oil spill.",2017,
Bayesian lasso binary quantile regression,"In this paper, a Bayesian hierarchical model for variable selection and estimation in the context of binary quantile regression is proposed. Existing approaches to variable selection in a binary classification context are sensitive to outliers, heteroskedasticity or other anomalies of the latent response. The method proposed in this study overcomes these problems in an attractive and straightforward way. A Laplace likelihood and Laplace priors for the regression parameters are proposed and estimated with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The resulting model is equivalent to the frequentist lasso procedure. A conceptional result is that by doing so, the binary regression model is moved from a Gaussian to a full Laplacian framework without sacrificing much computational efficiency. In addition, an efficient Gibbs sampler to estimate the model parameters is proposed that is superior to the Metropolis algorithm that is used in previous studies on Bayesian binary quantile regression. Both the simulation studies and the real data analysis indicate that the proposed method performs well in comparison to the other methods. Moreover, as the base model is binary quantile regression, a much more detailed insight in the effects of the covariates is provided by the approach. An implementation of the lasso procedure for binary quantile regression models is available in the R-package bayesQR.",2013,Computational Statistics

As is well known, if only one scalar ï¬eld isnon-minimally coupled, then one may perform a conformal transformation to a newframe in which both the gravitational portion of the Lagrangian and the kinetic termfor the (rescaled) ï¬eld assume canonical form. We examine under what conditionsthe gravitational and kinetic terms in the Lagrangian may be brought into canonicalform when more than one scalar ï¬eld has non-minimal coupling.

Isolation and identification of moderately halophilic bacteria producing hydrolytic enzymes from the largest hypersaline playa in Iran,"Iran has many hypersaline environments, both the permanent and seasonal ones. One of the seasonal hypersaline lakes in the central desert zone is Aran-Bidgol Lake in which microbial diversity has not been characterized, thus the potential usage of this microbial community in biotechnology remained unknown. In this study, screening the halophilic hydrolytic enzyme-producing bacteria from different areas of this lake led to isolation of 61 gram-positive and 22 gram-negative moderately halophilic bacteria. These bacterial isolates were shown to produce a wide variety of hydrolytic enzymes including DNase, inulinase, amylase, lipase, pectinase, protease, chitinase, pullulanase, cellulase, and xylanase. The most common enzymes were DNase and inulinase in gram-positive bacteria, lipase in gram-negative bacteria, and pullulanase and cellulase in gram-positive cocci. Interestingly, combined hydrolytic activates were observed in some isolates. According to their phenotypic characteristics and comparative partial 16S rRNA sequence analysis, the moderately halophilic strains belonged to the genera Halobacillus, Thalassobacillus, Bacillus, Salinicoccus, Idiomarina, Salicola, and Halomonas.",2013,Microbiology
"[Experimental poisoning of carp fingerlings (Cyprinus carpio L.) with the herbicidal preparation, lasagrin (alachlor)].","The acute intoxication of K1 carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) with the herbicide preparation lassagrin (alachlor) was studied under experimental conditions in a laboratory. Used were a total of 360 young carps of 10 g each, measuring 9-10 cm. The experiments were carried out in 30-1 glass aquariums that were preliminary filled with water that was adequately heated and deprived of chlorine at pH = 6.9, T0C = 18-20 degrees C, O2 = 10.4 mg/1; hardness = 1.5 German degrees. The preparation was directly placed in the aquariums in eleven concentrations. The following characteristic symptoms of intoxication were established: higher irritability of the nervous system with superactivity, lack of coordination and orientation, depression in later hours, loss of sight, disturbed pigmentation. No morphologic changes were found at necropsy. Determined was the concentration at which 50% of the test material died at the 96th hour of exposure: LC50/TLm/=4.67 mg, the interval of dependability at 95% probability being 4.04-5.30. Both toxicometry data and intoxication symptoms with the use of lassagrin (alachlor, lasso) made it reasonable to believe that the preparation could be referred to poisons having resorptive action so far as carps are concerned.",1978,Veterinarno-meditsinski nauki
Model selection with lasso-zero: adding straw to the haystack to better find needles,"The high-dimensional linear model $y = X \beta^0 + \epsilon$ is considered and the focus is put on the problem of recovering the support $S^0$ of the sparse vector $\beta^0.$ We introduce lasso-zero, a new $\ell_1$-based estimator whose novelty resides in an ""overfit, then threshold"" paradigm and the use of noise dictionaries for overfitting the response. The methodology is supported by theoretical results obtained in the special case where no noise dictionary is used. In this case, lasso-zero boils down to thresholding the basis pursuit solution. We prove that this procedure requires weaker conditions on $X$ and $S^0$ than the lasso for exact support recovery, and controls the false discovery rate for orthonormal designs when tuned by the quantile universal threshold. However it requires a high signal-to-noise ratio, and the use of noise dictionaries addresses this issue. The threshold selection procedure is based on a pivotal statistic and does not require knowledge of the noise level. Numerical simulations show that lasso-zero performs well in terms of support recovery and provides a good trade-off between high true positive rate and low false discovery rate compared to competitors.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Dynamics of social networks of urban informal entrepreneurs in an African economy,"AbstractThis paper carries out an analysis of the formation and transformation of social relations and networks of access to resources in the professional trajectory of micro-entrepreneurs operating in an urban informal African economy. The analysis of social networks is rooted in Granovetterâ€™s structural embeddedness framework combined with the dynamic and discursive conception of social relations of Harisson White (embeddedness and decoupling). Life stories of micro and small entrepreneurs in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina-Faso) are analyzed by mixing qualitative and quantitative methods. Results suggest that the construction of social networks and interpersonal relations of access to resources is a long-term process. A co-construction of social networks and economic activity is observed; it challenges the argument that social capital is a substitute for a lack of personal resources. The growth of small and micro activities is linked to the professionalization and stabilization of a social network, and even to...",2018,Review of Social Economy
"Changing relationship with the land and one another in PindoyÃº, Paraguay","This thesis is about agricultural transition in the face of globalization in the community of PindoyÃº, Paraguay. Utilizing the extended case study method, the experiences of people of PindoyÃº are documented through partcipant observation, individual and household interviews, and auto-ethnographies in order to illuminate theory on the articulation of modes of production, moral economy, and Marxist ecology. Rooted in Meillassouxâ€™s understanding of the domestic mode of production and Wolpeâ€™s extended view of the articulated modes of production, it argues that people in PindoyÃº are participating in the capitalist mode of production while also practicing values incongruent with capitalist production. Findings suggest that values and social norms are institutionalized in PindoyÃº through the policies and projects of community groups, which serve as a reproductive mechanism for an alternative mode of production. These values have been historically practiced and remain within the communityâ€™s collective memory. The findings have implications for community development projects and policies in rural Paraguay and contribute to theory in Marxist anthropology.",2015,
An Empirical Analysis of Funding Costs Spillovers in the Euro-Zone with Application to Systemic Risk,"We propose a framework for estimation of spillovers between funding costs of individual banks. The estimation proceeds in three steps: First, using data from liquidity auctions of the European Central Bank, we estimate the funding costs in a given week for each individual bank. In the second step, we apply the adaptive elastic net (a LASSO type estimator) to this panel to estimate the financial network. Finally, using the estimated network we propose new measures of the systemicness and vulnerability of each bank. Our measure of systemicness has quite a natural interpretation, since it can roughly be viewed as the total externality a bank would impose on the funding costs of all other banks in the system. We estimate that most of the banks have fairly weak links and, therefore, if one were to suffer an adverse shock there would likely be a rather limited effect on the other ones. On the other hand, there are a few banks that are quite central: an increase in their funding costs would result in a very significant increase (up to 95 bp per 100 bp shock) in the funding costs of the other banks. Our vulnerability scores estimated using data from 2007-2008 are positively correlated with the probability of a bank being bailed out later.",2015,National Bureau of Economic Research
A drifter of Dadaist persuasion,"1.1. Abstractions. Both my parents were very deeply involved in the scene of Italian contemporary art, over the span of several decades. Both of them studied Architecture in the late 1950s and early 1960s at the Politecnico in Milan. My mother, who had been a student Ernesto Nathan Rogers, collaborated with some of the most visible figures in architecture and graphic design of the time: Konrad Wachsmann, Ignazio Gardella, Albe Steiner. My father became a colleague of Umberto Eco and TomÃ¡s Maldonado at the experimental university program in the arts, the DAMS of Bologna. My parents were also painters, and their art was frequently inspired by mathematical themes (Figure 1 and Figure 2). In the 1970s, both before and after my parents divorced, our house was frequented by a circle of artists, designers, and various communist intellectuals. I grew up surrounded by contemporary art, well versed in its history and meaning. I grew up listening to atonal 20th century classical music: by the time I was in my early teens, my favorite composers were Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Iannis Xenakis, Giacinto Scelsi, Pierre Boulez. Later in my teens I discovered early music: Carlo Gesualdo, Luca Marenzio, Orlando di Lasso. I never came to terms with the Romanticism, which remains incomprehensible to me to this day. My taste in the visual arts was largely influenced by the artistic movements that surrounded me in my early years: my fatherâ€™s Abstractism was close to the currents of Op Art and Kinetic Art and to the Ulm school of Design. My motherâ€™s Conceptual Art was informed by Dadaism and Minimalism, and by Semiotics. I could relate deeply to the Russian Avant-garde and the painters of the Bauhaus period, as well as to the Abstract Expressionism of postwar America.",2015,
Bayesian neural networks increasingly sparsify their units with depth,"We investigate deep Bayesian neural networks with Gaussian priors on the weights and ReLU-like nonlinearities, shedding light on novel sparsity-inducing mechanisms at the level of the units of the network, both pre-and post-nonlinearities. The main thrust of the paper is to establish that the units prior distribution becomes increasingly heavy-tailed with depth. We show that first layer units are Gaussian, second layer units are sub-Exponential, and we introduce sub-Weibull distributions to characterize the deeper layers units. Bayesian neural networks with Gaussian priors are well known to induce the weight decay penalty on the weights. In contrast, our result indicates a more elaborate regularization scheme at the level of the units, ranging from convex penalties for the first two layers-weight decay for the first and Lasso for the second to non convex penalties for deeper layers. Thus, despite weight decay does not allow for the weights to be set exactly to zero, sparse solutions tend to be selected for the units from the second layer onward. This result provides new theoretical insight on deep Bayesian neural networks, underpinning their natural shrinkage properties and practical potential.",2018,ArXiv
Development of novel prognostic models for predicting complications of urethroplasty,"Introduction and objectiveTo identify predictors of thirty-day perioperative complications after urethroplasty and create a model to predict patients at increased risk.MethodsWe selected all patients recorded in the National Surgery Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) from 2005 to 2015 who underwent urethroplasty, determined by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. The primary outcome of interest was a composite 30-day complication rate. To develop predictive models of urethroplasty complications we used random forest and logistic regression with tenfold cross-validation employing demographic, comorbidity, laboratory, and wound characteristics as candidate predictors. Models were selected based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, with the primary measure of performance being the area under curve (AUC).ResultsWe identified 1135 patients who underwent urethroplasty and met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 53Â years with 84% being male. The overall incidence of complications was 8.6% (nâ€‰=â€‰98). Patients who experienced a complication more commonly had diabetes, a preoperative blood transfusion, preoperative sepsis, lower hematocrit and albumin, as well as a longer operative time (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). LASSO logistic and random forest logistic models for predicting urethroplasty complications had an AUC (95% CI) 0.73 (0.58â€“0.87), and 0.48 (0.33â€“0.68), respectively. The variables that were determined to be most important and included in the predictive models were operative time, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification and preoperative laboratory values (white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, platelets).ConclusionOur predictive models of complications perform well and may allow for improved preoperative counseling and risk stratification in the surgical management of urethral stricture.",2018,World Journal of Urology
A Critical Review on Socio-Economic Consideration in Nepalese Environmental Impact Assessment,"Nepal enters into the federal state from a long unitary system of governance. With this changing governance system, there is high level of development aspiration and demand of people. Government of Nepal, Province and Local Government are planning to carry out development activities in an accelerating pace with the goal of high-level economic growth. In an era where global population growth continues to increase geometrically and development is inevitable (MEA, 2005), there has been a consensus to pursue sustainable development by harmonizing development with the environment (Glasson et al, 2012). One of the tools recommended in achieving the goal of sustainable development is Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) (Jay et al, 2007). The effectiveness of EIA has been given great attention by EIA practitioners, academics and policy makers (Sandham and Pretorius, 2008) through examining the quality of EIA (Fuller, 1999; Cashmore et al, 2002).",2019,
"Biodiversity of Archaea and floral of two inland saltern ecosystems in the Alto VinalopÃ³ Valley, Spain","BackgroundThe extraction of salt from seawater by means of coastal solar salterns is a very well-described process. Moreover, the characterization of these environments from ecological, biochemical and microbiological perspectives has become a key focus for many research groups all over the world over the last 20 years. In countries such as Spain, there are several examples of coastal solar salterns (mainly on the Mediterranean coast) and inland solar salterns, from which sodium chloride is obtained for human consumption. However, studies focused on the characterization of inland solar salterns are scarce and both the archaeal diversity and the plant communities inhabiting these environments remain poorly described.ResultsTwo of the inland solar salterns (termed Redonda and Penalva), located in the Alto VinalopÃ³ Valley (Alicante, Spain), were characterized regarding their geological and physico-chemical characteristics and their archaeal and botanical biodiversity. A preliminary eukaryotic diversity survey was also performed using saline water. The chemical characterization of the brine has revealed that the salted groundwater extracted to fill these inland solar salterns is thalassohaline. The plant communities living in this environment are dominated by Sarcocornia fruticosa (L.) A.J. Scott, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum (Moris) K. Koch, Suaeda vera Forsk. ex Gmelin (Amaranthaceae) and several species of Limonium (Mill) and Tamarix (L). Archaeal diversity was analyzed and compared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular phylogenetic techniques. Most of the sequences recovered from environmental DNA samples are affiliated with haloarchaeal genera such as Haloarcula, Halorubrum, Haloquadratum and Halobacterium, and with an unclassified member of the Halobacteriaceae. The eukaryote Dunaliella was also present in the samples.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this study constitutes the first analysis centered on inland solar salterns located in the southeastern region of Spain. The results obtained revealed that the salt deposits of this region have marine origins. Plant communities typical of salt marshes are present in this ecosystem and members of the Halobacteriaceae family can be easily detected in the microbial populations of these habitats. Possible origins of the haloarchaea detected in this study are discussed.",2010,Saline Systems
A tribute to Hai-yan Wang (1937-2014).,"Ming-hui Zhao Renal Division, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China Correspondence: Ming-hui Zhao, Renal Division, Peking University First Hospital, No. 8 Xishiku Street, Beijing 100034, China. E-mail: mhzhao@bjmu. edu.cn I t is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of Professor Hai-yan Wang on 11 December 2014 at the age of 77. Behind this internationally renowned name was a woman of great will, enthusiasm, and outstanding intelligence. She became one of the very few who helped give birth, growth, and strength to modern nephrology in China. Hai-yan Wang was born on 8 July 1937 in Qing-dao, Shan-dong Province, China. She graduated from Beijing Medical College in 1959 and started her career as a nephrologist under the mentorship of the late Professor Shu-xian Wang, founder of modern nephrology in China. From 1980 to 1983, she was a pioneering visiting scholar, under the supervision of Professor R. Glassock and Professor W. Border at the University of California, Los Angeles. Hai-yan was a lifelong tenured professor of medicine at Peking University First Hospital and president of the Peking University Institute of Nephrology. She was a well-known leading physician-scientist, recognizing the heterogeneity of various causes of intrinsic acute renal failure and improving the concept of primary glomerulonephritis in China in the 1980s. At the same time, her work in establishing a clinical database and biobank on various kidney diseases played a fundamental role in future translational studies. Aside from these successes, she launched clinical epidemiology in China involving chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury. Not only did she build one of the most successful renal programs at Peking University First Hospital, but she also trained many nephrologists throughout the country. In 2013, she was awarded the International Society of Nephrology Roscoe R. Robinson Award and the first ISN Pioneer in Nephrology Award for her outstanding contributions to nephrology education and the development of modern nephrology in China. Professor Hai-yan Wang was very active in the academic area of national and international nephrology as well as internal medicine. She served as Council member of the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) (2004â€“2008), ISN executive councilor (2006â€“2008), and chair of the ISN East Asia Committee (2004â€“2013) and was a member of the ISN 0by25 advisory group. She was vice president of the Chinese Medical Association (1999â€“2009), president of the Chinese Society of Internal Medicine (2000â€“ 2008), and president of the Chinese Society of Ne phrology (1992â€“1998).

Robust Estimation Of Hi-C Contact Matrices Using Fused Lasso Reveals Preferential Insulation Of Super-Enhancers By Strong TAD Boundaries,"The metazoan genome is compartmentalized in megabase-scale areas of highly interacting chromatin known as topologically associating domains (TADs), typically identified by computational analyses of Hi-C sequencing data. TADs are demarcated by boundaries that have been shown to be largely conserved across cell types and even across species. Increasing evidence suggests that the seemingly invariant TADs may exhibit some plasticity in certain cases and their boundary strength can vary. However, a genome-wide characterization of TAD boundary strength in mammals is still lacking. In this study, we use fused two-dimensional lasso as a machine-learning method to first improve Hi-C contact matrix reproducibility and subsequently categorize TAD boundaries based on their strength. We demonstrate that increased boundary strength is associated with elevated levels of CTCF and that TAD boundary insulation scores may differ across cell types. Intriguingly, we also found that super-enhancer elements are preferentially insulated by strong boundaries. Presumably, genetic or epigenetic inactivation of strong boundaries may lead to loss of insulation around super-enhancers, disrupt the physiological transcriptional program and cause disease.",2017,bioRxiv
On Performance of Shrinkage Methods â€“ A Monte Carlo Study,"Multicollinearity has been a serious problem in regression analysis, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression may result in high variability in the estimates of the regression coefficients in the presence of multicollinearity. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) methods is a well established method that reduces the variability of the estimates by shrinking the coefficients and at the same time produces interpretable models by shrinking some coefficients to exactly zero. We present the performance of LASSO -type estimators in the presence of multicollinearity using Monte Carlo approach. The performance of LASSO, Adaptive LASSO, Elastic Net, Fused LASSO and Ridge Regression (RR) in the presence of multicollinearity in simulated data sets are compared Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) criteria. A Monte Carlo experiment of 1000 trials was carried out at different sample sizes n (50, 100 and 150) with different levels of multicollinearity among the exogenous variables (Ï = 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9). The overall performance of Lasso appears to be the best but Elastic net tends to be more accurate when the sample size is large.",2015,International journal of statistics and applications
Pathway-Structured Predictive Model for Cancer Survival Prediction: A Two-Stage Approach,"Heterogeneity in terms of tumor characteristics, prognosis, and survival among cancer patients has been a persistent problem for many decades. Currently, prognosis and outcome predictions are made based on clinical factors and/or by incorporating molecular profiling data. However, inaccurate prognosis and prediction may result by using only clinical or molecular information directly. One of the main shortcomings of past studies is the failure to incorporate prior biological information into the predictive model, given strong evidence of pathway-based genetic nature of cancer, i.e. the potential for oncogenes to be grouped into pathways based on biological functions such as cell survival, proliferation and metastatic dissemination. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage procedure to incorporate pathway information into the prognostic modeling using large-scale gene expression data. In the first stage, we fit all predictors within each pathway using penalized Cox model (Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net) and Bayesian hierarchical Cox model. In the second stage, we combine the cross-validated prognostic scores of all pathways obtained in the first stage as new predictors to build an integrated prognostic model for prediction. We apply the proposed method to analyze breast cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), predicting overall survival using clinical data and gene expression profiling. The data includes ~20000 genes mapped into 109 pathways for 505 patients. The results show that the proposed approach not only improves survival prediction compared with the alternative analysis that ignores the pathway information, but also identifies significant biological pathways.",2016,bioRxiv
Bayesian Iterative Adaptive Lasso Quantile Regression,"Based on the Bayesian adaptive Lasso quantile regression (Alhamzawi et al., 2012), we propose the iterative adaptive Lasso quantile regression, which is an extension to the Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm (Sun et al., 2010). The proposed method is demonstrated via simulation studies and a real data set. Results indicate that the new algorithm performs quite good in comparison to the other existing methods.",2017,IOSR Journal of Mathematics

Asymptotically Linear Estimators of the Precision Matrix,"This chapter looks at two approaches towards establishing confidence intervals for the entries in high-dimensional precision matrix. The first approach is based on the graphical Lasso, whereas the second one invokes the square-root node-wise Lasso as initial estimator. In both cases the one-step adjustment or â€œde-sparsifying stepâ€ is numerically very simple. Under distributional and sparsity assumptions, the de-sparsified estimator of the precision matrix is asymptotically linear. Here, the conditions are stronger when using the graphical Lasso than when using the square-root node-wise Lasso",2016,

Skull Retrieval for Craniosynostosis Using Sparse Logistic Regression Models,"Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of the bones of the calvaria resulting in abnormal skull shapes that can be associated with increased intracranial pressure. While craniosynostoses of multiple different types can be easily diagnosed, quantifying the severity of the abnormality is much more subjective and not a standard part of clinical practice. For this purpose we have developed a severity-based retrieval system that uses a logistic regression approach to quantify the severity of the abnormality of each of three types of craniosynostoses. We compare several different sparse feature selection techniques: L1 regularized logistic regression, fused lasso, and clustering lasso (cLasso). We evaluate our methodology in three ways: 1) for classification of normal vs. abnormal skulls, 2) for comparing pre-operative to post-operative skulls, and 3) for retrieving skulls in order of abnormality severity as compared with the ordering of a craniofacial expert.",2012,Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

The Complexity and Fragility of Early Iron Age Urbanism in West-Central Temperate Europe,"The development of large agglomerations is one of the most important phenomena in later Eurasian prehistory. In west-central temperate Europe, the origins of urbanism have long been associated with the oppida of the second to first centuries BC. However, large-scale excavations and surveys carried out over the last two decades have fundamentally modified the traditional picture of early centralization processes. New results indicate that the first urban centres north of the Alps developed over time between the end of the seventh and the fifth century BC in an area stretching from Bohemia to southern Germany and Central France. Sites such as the Heuneburg, ZÃ¡vist, Mont Lassois and Bourges produce evidence of a process of differentiation and hierarchization in the pattern of settlement that was concurrently an expression of, and a catalyst for, increasing social inequality. Although contacts with the Mediterranean world would certainly have played a role in such processes, endogenous factors were primarily responsible for the development of these early Central European agglomerations. This paper summarizes recent fieldwork results, showing the heterogeneity and diversity of Early Iron Age central places and outlining their diachronic development. The fragility and ephemeral character of these centres of power and their territories is highlighted. Their demise was followed by a period of decentralization that constitutes a prime example of the non-linear character of history.",2017,Journal of World Prehistory

Modeling High-Dimensional Multichannel Brain Signals,"Our goal is to model and measure functional and effective (directional) connectivity in multichannel brain physiological signals (e.g., electroencephalograms, local field potentials). The difficulties from analyzing these data mainly come from two aspects: first, there are major statistical and computational challenges for modeling and analyzing high-dimensional multichannel brain signals; second, there is no set of universally agreed measures for characterizing connectivity. To model multichannel brain signals, our approach is to fit a vector autoregressive (VAR) model with potentially high lag order so that complex lead-lag temporal dynamics between the channels can be captured. Estimates of the VAR model will be obtained by our proposed hybrid LASSLE (LASSOÂ $$+$$+Â LSE) method which combines regularization (to control for sparsity) and least squares estimation (to improve bias and mean-squared error). Then we employ some measures of connectivity but put an emphasis on partial directed coherence (PDC) which can capture the directional connectivity between channels. PDC is a frequency-specific measure that explains the extent to which the present oscillatory activity in a sender channel influences the future oscillatory activity in a specific receiver channel relative to all possible receivers in the network. The proposed modeling approach provided key insights into potential functional relationships among simultaneously recorded sites during performance of a complex memory task. Specifically, this novel method was successful in quantifying patterns of effective connectivity across electrode locations, and in capturing how these patterns varied across trial epochs and trial types.",2017,Statistics in Biosciences

CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION The work described i n t h i s t h e s i s commenced i n 1970 when a number of c o u n t r i e s , p a r t i c u l a r l y the U.S.A. and Japan, were i n t r o d u c i n g much s t r i c t e r c o n t r o l s over the emission of sulphur dioxide from s t a t i o n a r y sources, i . e . e l e c t r i c i t y generating s t a t i o n s and other i n d u s t r i a l p l a n t .

Of the many methods of achieving a r e d u c t i o n i n sulphur d i o x i d e emissions, i t was decided t o study some of the r e a c t i o n s and re a c t a n t s associated with, the use of a l k a l i n e e a r t h metal compounds. This was a n a t u r a l c o n t i n u a t i o n of the extensive work already c a r r i e d out i n these l a b o r a t o r i e s by Glasson^'^ and the more l i m i t e d studies c a r r i e d 2 3 out by the present author ' , Dry processes of f l u e gas d e s u l p h u r i s a t i o n have the advantage t h a t i t should be possi b l e t o t r e a t the f l u e gas w i t h o u t causing a large r e d u c t i o n i n temperature, as occurs w i t h wet scrubbing methods; the problems associated w i t h lack of plume buoyancy, v ^ i c h occur when the gas temperature becomes too low, would be avoided.

"Ability of Pederson cleaner shrimp to remove juveniles of the parasitic cymothoid isopod, Anilocra haemuli, from the host.","Eight species of prospective cleaners, four fishes (sharknosed goby Gobiosoma evelynae, and juveniles of bluehead (wrasse) Thalassoma bifasciatum, Spanish hogfish Bodianus rufus and gray angelfish Pomaccanthus arcuatus) and four shrimps (cleaner shrimp Lysmata grabhami, Pederson cleaner shrimp Periclimenes pedersoni, banded coral shrimp Stenopus hispidus and golden coral shrimp Stenopus scutellatus) were evaluated in aquaria for their ability to remove newly settled juveniles of the fish-parasitic cymothoid isopod Anilocra haemuli from French grunts Haemulon flavolineatum. Periclimenes pedersoni removed all isopods almost immediately. No other cleaners removed any isopods over a 24 hr challenge period.

A novel variable-separation method based on sparse representation for stochastic partial differential equations,"In this paper, we propose a novel variable-separation (NVS) method for generic multivariate functions. The idea of NVS is extended to to obtain the solution in tensor product structure for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). 
Compared with many widely used variation-separation methods, NVS shares their merits but has less computation complexity and better efficiency. 
NVS can be used to get the separated representation of the solution for SPDE in a systematic enrichment manner. 
No iteration is performed at each enrichment step. This is a significant improvement compared with proper generalized decomposition. Because the stochastic functions of the separated representations obtained by NVS depend on the previous terms, this impacts on the computation efficiency and brings great challenge for numerical simulation for the problems in high stochastic dimensional spaces. 
In order to overcome the difficulty, we propose an improved least angle regression algorithm (ILARS) and a hierarchical sparse low rank tensor approximation (HSLRTA) method based on sparse regularization. For ILARS, we explicitly give the selection of the optimal regularization parameters at each step based on least angle regression algorithm (LARS) for lasso problems such that ILARS is much more efficient. 
HSLRTA hierarchically decomposes a high dimensional problem into some low dimensional problems and brings an accurate approximation for the solution to SPDEs in high dimensional stochastic spaces using limited computer resource. 
A few numerical examples are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.",2016,arXiv: Numerical Analysis
Integrated Framework for Selection of Additive and Nonadditive Genetic Markers for Genomic Selection.,"Genomic selection is a modified form of marker-assisted selection in which the markers from the whole genome are used to estimate the genomic-estimated breeding value (GEBV). Several estimators are available to estimate GEBV. These estimators are able to capture either additive genetic effects or nonadditive genetic effects. However, there is hardly any procedure available that could capture both the effects simultaneously. Therefore, this study has been conducted to develop an integrated framework that is able to capture both additive and nonadditive effects efficiently. This integrated framework has been developed after evaluating existing additive and nonadditive models for marker selection. Furthermore, two efficient additive and nonadditive methods, that is, sparse additive models (SpAM) and Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (HSIC LASSO), have been combined to select both additive and nonadditive genetic markers for estimation of GEBV. The performance of the proposed framework has been evaluated on the basis of prediction accuracy, fraction of correctly selected features, and redundancy rate, along with standard error of mean for estimation of GEBV, compared with the individual performances of SpAM and HSIC LASSO separately. The newly developed framework is found to be satisfactory in terms of its performance and found to be robust for estimation of GEBV.",2019,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology
Asymptotically exact error analysis for the generalized equation-LASSO,"Given an unknown signal x<sub>0</sub> âˆˆ R<sup>n</sup> and linear noisy measurements y = Ax<sub>0</sub> + Ïƒv âˆˆ R<sup>m</sup>, the generalized â„“<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>-LASSO solves xÌ‚ := arg min<sup>x</sup> 1/2âˆ¥y-Ax âˆ¥<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + ÏƒÎ»f(x). Here, f is a convex regularization function (e.g. â„“<sub>1</sub>-norm, nuclearnorm) aiming to promote the structure of x<sub>0</sub> (e.g. sparse, lowrank), and, Î» â‰¥ 0 is the regularizer parameter. A related optimization problem, though not as popular or well-known, is often referred to as the generalized â„“<sub>2</sub>-LASSO and takes the form xÌ‚Ì‚Ì‚ := arg min<sub>x</sub> âˆ¥y-Axâˆ¥<sub>2</sub> +Î»f(x), and has been analyzed by Oymak, Thrampoulidis and Hassibi. Oymak et al. further made conjectures about the performance of the generalized â„“<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>-LASSO. This paper establishes these conjectures rigorously. We measure performance with the normalized squared error NSE(Ïƒ) := âˆ¥x-x<sub>0</sub>âˆ¥<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>/(mÏƒ<sup>2</sup>). Assuming the entries of A are i.i.d. Gaussian N (0,1/m) and those of v are i.i.d. N(0,1), we precisely characterize the â€œasymptotic NSEâ€ aNSE := lim<sub>Ïƒâ†’0</sub> NSE(Ïƒ) when the problem dimensions tend to infinity in a proportional manner. The role of Î», f and x<sub>0</sub> is explicitly captured in the derived expression via means of a single geometric quantity, the Gaussian distance to the subdifferential. We conjecture that aNSE = sup<sub>Ïƒ>0</sub> NSE(Ïƒ). We include detailed discussions on the interpretation of our result, make connections to relevant literature and perform computational experiments that validate our theoretical findings.",2015,2015 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)
Thromboembolic Risks of the Procedural Process in Second-Generation Cryoballoon Ablation Procedures: Analysis From Real-Time Transcranial Doppler Monitoring,"Background Atrial fibrillation ablation is associated with substantial risks of silent cerebral events (SCEs) or silent cerebral lesions. We investigated which procedural processes during cryoballoon procedures carried a risk. Methods and Results Forty paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients underwent pulmonary vein isolation using second-generation cryoballoons with single 28-mm balloon 3-minute freeze techniques. Microembolic signals (MESs) were monitored by transcranial Doppler throughout all procedures. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was obtained pre- and post-procedure in 34 patients (85.0%). Of 158 pulmonary veins, 152 (96.2%) were isolated using cryoablation, and 6 required touch-up radiofrequency ablation. A mean of 5.0Â±1.2 cryoballoon applications was applied, and the left atrial dwell time was 76.7Â±22.4 minutes. The total MES counts/procedures were 522 (426â€“626). Left atrial access and Flexcath sheath insertion generated 25 (11â€“44) and 34 (24â€“53) MESs. Using radiofrequency ablation for transseptal access increased the MES count during transseptal punctures. During cryoapplications, MES counts were greatest during first applications (117 [81â€“157]), especially after balloon stretch/deflations (43 [21â€“81]). Preâ€“ and postâ€“pulmonary vein potential mapping with Lasso catheters generated 57 (21â€“88) and 61 (36â€“88) MESs. Reinsertion of once withdrawn cryoballoons and subsequent applications produced 205 (156â€“310) MESs. Touch-up ablation generated 32 (19â€“62) MESs, whereas electric cardioversion generated no MESs. SCEs and silent cerebral lesions were detected in 11 (32.3%) and 4 (11.7%) patients, respectively. The patients with SCEs were older than those without; however, there were no significant factors associated with SCEs. Conclusions A significant number of MESs and SCE/silent cerebral lesion occurrences were observed during second-generation cryoballoon ablation procedures. MESs were recorded during a variety of steps throughout the procedure; however, the majority occurred during phases with a high probability of gaseous emboli.",2017,Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology
Beamforming With Small-Spacing Microphone Arrays Using Constrained/Generalized LASSO,"In this letter, we develop an approach to the design of beamformers with small-spacing uniform linear microphone arrays by incorporating sparseness constraints for attenuating scattered interference incident from some pre-specified ranges of directions of arrival. The design process is formulated as a constrained LASSO problem. By adjusting the value of a tuning parameter, the proposed method can make compromises among three important yet conflicting (especially at low frequencies) performance measures of small-spacing microphone arrays, i.e., the directivity factor (DF), which quantifies the array spatial gain, the white noise gain (WNG), which evaluates the robustness of the beamformer, and the signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) gain with respect to scattered interference. Simulation results illustrate the properties of the developed approach.",2020,IEEE Signal Processing Letters
The Double Dantzig G,"The Dantzig selector (Candes and Tao, 2007) is a new approach th t as been proposed for performing variable selection and model fitting on linear regression models. It uses anL1 penalty to shrink the regression coefficients towards zero, in a similar fashion to the Lasso. While both the Lasso and Dantzig select or potentially do a good job of selecting the correct variables, several researcher s ave noted that they tend to over shrink the final coefficients. This results in an unfortu nate tradeoff. One can either select a high shrinkage tuning parameter that produces an accurate model but poor coefficient estimates or a low shrinkage tuning parameter th at produces more accurate coefficients but includes many irrelevant variables. W e propose a new approach called the â€œDouble Dantzigâ€. The Double Dantzig has two key a dvantages over both the Dantzig selector and the Lasso. First, we demonstrate th it can select the correct model without over shrinking the coefficient estimates. Sec ond, it can be applied to all standard generalized linear model response distributi ons. In addition we develop a path algorithm to simultaneously compute the coefficient e stimates for all values of the tuning parameter, making our approach computationally efficient. A detailed simulation study is performed which illustrates the advantage s of the Double Dantzig in relation to other possible methods. Finally, we demonstrat e the Double Dantzig on several real world data sets. Some key words : Dantzig Selector; Double Dantzig; Generalized Linear Mod els; Lasso; Variable",2007,

Machine Learning to Predict In-hospital Morbidity and Mortality after Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Recently, successful predictions using machine learning (ML) algorithms have been reported in various fields. However, in traumatic brain injury (TBI) cohorts, few studies have examined modern ML algorithms. To develop a simple ML model for TBI outcome prediction, we conducted a performance comparison of nine algorithms: ridge regression, LASSO regression, random forest, gradient boosting, extra trees, decision tree, Gaussian naÃ¯ve Bayes, multinomial naÃ¯ve Bayes, and support vector machine. Fourteen feasible parameters were introduced in the ML models, including age, Glasgow coma scale, systolic blood pressure, abnormal pupillary response, major extracranial injury, computed tomography findings, and routinely collected laboratory values (glucose, C-reactive protein, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products). Data from 232 TBI patients were randomly divided into a training sample (80%) for hyperparameter tuning and validation sample (20%). The bootstrap method was used for validation. Random forest demonstrated the best performance for in-hospital poor outcome prediction and ridge regression for in-hospital mortality prediction: the mean statistical measures were 100% sensitivity, 72.3% specificity, 91.7% accuracy, and 0.895 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC); and 88.4% sensitivity, 88.2% specificity, 88.6% accuracy, and 0.875 AUC, respectively. Based on the feature selection method using the tree-based ensemble algorithm, age, Glasgow coma scale, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, and glucose were identified as the most important prognostic factors for poor outcome and mortality. Our results indicated the relatively good predictive performance of modern ML for TBI outcome. Further external validation is required for more heterogeneous samples to confirm our results.",2019,Journal of neurotrauma
Feature selection and tumor classification for microarray data using relaxed Lasso and generalized multi-class support vector machine.,"At present, the study of gene expression data provides a reference for tumor diagnosis at the molecular level. It is a challenging task to select the feature genes related to the classification from the high-dimensional and small-sample gene expression data and successfully separate the different subtypes of tumor or between the normal and patient. In this paper, we present a new method for tumor classification-relaxed Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and generalized multi-class support vector machine (rL-GenSVM). The tumor datasets are firstly z-score normalized. Secondly, using relaxed Lasso to select feature gene sets on training set, and finally, generalized multi-class support vector machine (GenSVM) serves as a classifier. We select four two-class datasets and four multi-class datasets for experiments. And four classifiers are used to predict and compare the classification accuracy on test set. To compare with other proposed methods, we obtain satisfactory classification accuracy by 10-fold cross-validation on all samples of each dataset. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper selects fewer feature genes and achieves higher classification accuracy. rL-GenSVM uses regularization parameters to avoid overfitting and can be widely applied to high-dimensional and small-sample tumor data classification. The source code and all datasets are available at https://github.com/QUST-AIBBDRC/rL-GenSVM/.",2019,Journal of theoretical biology
Modelling Recovery Rates for Non-Performing Loans,"Based on a rich dataset of recoveries donated by a debt collection business, recovery rates for non-performing loans taken from a single European country are modelled using linear regression, linear regression with Lasso, beta regression and inflated beta regression. We also propose a two-stage model: beta mixture model combined with a logistic regression model. The proposed model allowed us to model the multimodal distribution we found for these recovery rates. All models were built using loan characteristics, default data and collections data prior to purchase by the debt collection business. The intended use of the models was to estimate future recovery rates for improved risk assessment, capital requirement calculations and bad debt management. They were compared using a range of quantitative performance measures under K-fold cross validation. Among all the models, we found that the proposed two-stage beta mixture model performs best.",2019,
Short-term travel time prediction by deep learning: A comparison of different LSTM-DNN models,"Predicting short-term travel time with considerable accuracy and reliability is critically important for advanced traffic management and route planning in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Short-term travel time prediction uses real travel time values within a sliding time window to predict travel time one or several time step(s) in future. However, the nonstationary properties and abrupt changes of travel time series make challenges in obtaining accurate and reliable predictions. Recent achievements of deep learning approaches in classification and regression shed a light on innovations of time series prediction. This study establishes a series of long short-term memory neural networks with deep neural layers (LSTM-DNN) using 16 settings of hyperparameters and investigates their performance on a 90-day travel time dataset from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Then competitive LSTM-DNN models are tested along with linear models such as linear regression, Ridge and Lasso regression, ARIMA and DNN models under 10 sets of sliding windows and predicting horizons via the same dataset. The results demonstrate the advantage of LSTM-DNN models while showing different characteristics of these deep learning models with different settings of hyperparameters, providing insights for optimizing the structures.",2017,2017 IEEE 20th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)
Effect of Operating Parameters on Performance of Nanofiltration of Sugar Beet Press Water,"Abstract Sugar beet press water is one of the main wastewater in the sugar industry, which presently returned to the diffuser with no further treatment. Some form of treatment, such as pretreatment with membrane may however, improved the output efficiency of sugar plants. In this study, nanofiltration membrane (AFC80) were used to investigate the permeate flux, fouling percent and rejection percent of most important molassogenic ions (sodium and potassium) and sucrose. Sugar beet press water was provided by Abkoh sugar beet factory. The effect of operating parameters such as temperature (at levels of 25,40and 55Â Â°C), trans membrane pressure (at levels of 10,15and 20Â bar) on nanofiltration performance (permeate flux, fouling and rejection) were investigated. The results show that maximum permeate flux is obtained at 55Â Â°C and 20Â bar, while the average value is 49.27 kgm-2h-1. The minimum permeate flux is obtained at 25Â Â°C and 10Â bar, and the average value in this conditions is 14.63 kgm-2h-1. Maximum and minimum fouling are reached at 55Â Â°C and 20Â bar and 25Â Â°C and 15Â bar, respectively. Furthermore maximum rejection of sodium and potassium (84.3% and 72.5% respectively) is obtained at 25Â Â°C and 20Â bar, and minimum of rejection of sodium and potassium (74.3% and 69.05% respectively) is obtained on 55Â Â°C and 10Â bar. For all operating conditions, sucrose rejection was exceeded 95%. Variation in operating conditions had no significant effect on sucrose rejection.",2011,Procedia food science
"LASSO, Two-Way and GPS Time Comparisons: A (Very) Preliminary Status Report","Abstract : This very preliminary report briefly presents the first results on the time transfer experiments between TUG (Graz, Austria) and OCA (Grasse, France) using common view GPS, and two-way stations at both sites. The present data, providing a rms of the clock offsets of 2 to 3 nanoseconds for a three months period, have to be further analysed before any conclusions on the respective precision and accuracy of these techniques can be drawn. Two years after its start, the LASSO experiment is finally giving its first results at TUG and OCA. The first analysis of three common sessions permitted us to conclude that the LASSO package on board of Meteosat P2 is working satisfactorily, and that time transfer using this method should provide clock offsets at better than 1 nanosecond precision, and clock rates at better then 10(-12) s/s in a 5 to 10 minutes session. A new method for extracting this information from the raw data sent by LASSO should enhance the performances of this experiment, exploiting the stability of the on-board oscillator.",1990,
The Danish chronic subdural hematoma studyâ€”predicting recurrence of chronic subdural hematoma,"BackgroundAnÂ increasing incidence of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) and an unchanging high recurrence rate of 10â€“20% call for individualized treatment. The aim of this study was to establish individualized prediction models for the risk of recurrence treating death as a competing risk.MethodsA retrospective national cohort of unilateral CSDH was included for analysis. Using competing risk survival analysis, we tested whether available covariates were associated with the risk of recurrence. We further established a pre- and a postoperative prediction model, where predictors were chosen using a LASSO approach. The models were visualized in nomograms. Predictive performance was evaluated by c index and calibrations plots.ResultsA total of 763 patients with surgically evacuated unilateral CSDH were included for analysis. The recurrence rate was 14% while 12% of patients died during follow-up (1Â year). In our association model, hematoma size, drain type, drainage time, presence of complications, and Glasgow Coma Score were significantly associated to recurrence. Subdural drain was associated with a lower recurrence risk than subgaleal drain. The preoperative model included hematoma size, hematoma density, and history of hypertension. The postoperative model included further drain type, drainage time, and surgical complications.ConclusionThe nomograms allow easy assessment of the recurrence risk for the individual patient, providing a better possibility for individual adjustment of treatment and follow-up. The predictive performance indicates that significant unaccounted or unknown factors still remain. The association test found passive subdural drain superior to passive subgaleal drain in minimizing the risk of CSDH recurrence.",2019,Acta Neurochirurgica
bilities of peptide-based [ 1 ] rotaxanes : molecular grafting onto lasso peptide sca ff olds â€ ,"The chemical synthesis of peptide-based [1]rotaxanes (lasso peptides) was achieved by [2]rotaxane formation followed by two chemoselective ligation reactions. Our approach enabled incorporation of various peptide sequences into a common rotaxane structure. The synthetic lasso peptides were characterized by NMR, chromatography, and partial degradation by proteases. A linear peptide epitope grafted onto the rotaxane scaffold showed significantly improved proteolytic stability.",2017,
Group subset selection for linear regression,"Two fast group subset selection (GSS) algorithms for the linear regression model are proposed in this paper. GSS finds the best combinations of groups up to a specified size minimising the residual sum of squares. This imposes an l0 constraint on the regression coefficients in a group context. It is a combinatorial optimisation problem with NP complexity. To make the exhaustive search very efficient, the GSS algorithms are built on QR decomposition and branch-and-bound techniques. They are suitable for middle scale problems where finding the most accurate solution is essential. In the application motivating this research, it is natural to require that the coefficients of some of the variables within groups satisfy some constraints (e.g. non-negativity). Therefore the GSS algorithms (optionally) calculate the model coefficient estimates during the exhaustive search in order to screen combinations that do not meet the constraints. The faster of the two GSS algorithms is compared to an extension to the original group Lasso, called the constrained group Lasso (CGL), which is proposed to handle convex constraints and to remove orthogonality requirements on the variables within each group. CGL is a convex relaxation of the GSS problem and hence more straightforward to solve. Although CGL is inferior to GSS in terms of group selection accuracy, it is a fast approximation to GSS if the optimal regularisation parameter can be determined efficiently and, in some cases, it may serve as a screening procedure to reduce the number of groups.",2014,Comput.

"Culture, Pregnancy and Childbirth in Uganda: Surviving the Womenâ€™s Battle","In Uganda, there are diverse and distinct cultures, and people give specific expressions or attach particular interest to basic events in life such as pregnancy and childbirth. Although much is known about the clinical aspects of conception, pregnancy, birth and the postpartum, it is widely believed that these events are greatly influenced by, among others, social and cultural beliefs, including gender and power relations and differences in roles and status between the sexes (Vlassoff and Bonilla 1994 Ubot 1992 Koblinsky and Anne 1993 Caldwell and Caldwell 1990 Mukhopadhyay and Higgins 1988). Socio-cultural expectations, such as the desire to have a large number of children or deliver children of a particular sex, and also the meaning of birthing, are key motivations for child bearing and getting pregnant. These also bring with them associated health risks (Kyomuhendo 2003 Ntozi 1990).",2009,
"Highâ€dimensional QSAR prediction of anticancer potency of imidazo[4,5â€b]pyridine derivatives using adjusted adaptive LASSO","In high-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies, identifying relevant molecular descriptors is a major goal. In this study, a proposed penalized method is used as a tool for molecular descriptors selection. The method, called adjusted adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (AALASSO), is employed to study the high-dimensional QSAR prediction of the anticancer potency of a series of imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives. This proposed penalized method can perform consistency selection and deal with grouping effects simultaneously. Compared with other commonly used penalized methods, such as LASSO and adaptive LASSO with different initial weights, the results show that AALASSO obtains the best predictive ability not only by consistency selection but also by encouraging grouping effects in selecting more correlated molecular descriptors. Hence, we conclude that AALASSO is a reliable penalized method in the field of high-dimensional QSAR studies",2015,Journal of Chemometrics
Adaptive Robust Methodology for Parameter Estimation and Variable Selection,"The dissertation consists of three distinct but related projects. We consider regression model fitting, variable selection in regression, and autocorrelation estimation in time series. In each procedure we formulate the problem in terms of minimizing an objective function which adapts to the given data. First we propose a robust M-estimation procedure for regression. The main purpose of the proposed methodology is to develop a procedure that adapts to light/heavy tailed, symmetric/asymmetric distributions with/without outliers. We focus on studying the properties of the maximum likelihood estimator of the asymmetric exponential power distribution, a broad distribution class that holds both Normal and asymmetric Laplace distributions as special cases. The proposed methodology unifies least squares and quantile regression in a data driven manner to capture both tail decay and asymmetry of the underlying distributions. Finite sample performance of the method is exhibited via extensive Monte Carlo simulation and real data applications. Second, we capitalize on the success of the proposed method and extend it to a variable selection procedure that selects the important predictors under a sparse setting. Quantile regression Lasso, i.e., quantile regession with L1 norm on the regression coefficients for regularization is a robust technique to perform variable selection. However which quantile should be adopted is unclear. The proposed methodology introduces a way to choose the most â€œinformativeâ€ quantile of interest that is used in the adaptive quantile regression Lasso. A modified BIC criterion is used to select the optimal tuning parameter. The proposed procedure selects the quantile based on the log-likelihood of the asymmetric Laplace distribution, and aims to perform the best quantile regression Lasso which is confirmed in both simulation study and a real data analysis. Third, we focus on alleviating the underestimation issue of the sample autocorrelation in linear stationary time series. We first formulate autocorrelation estimation into a least squares prob-",2017,
Extraction of the inner coil of a pacemaker lead slid into the pulmonary artery.,"A patient required lead extraction for chronic draining sinus, due to abandoned leads. Preoperatively, the chest film showed a filament in the right pulmonary artery: it was the inner coil of an old atrial lead that, while remaining anchored to the auricle, slid outside the outer coil. By right subclavian approach, the old ventricular lead and the outer coil of the atrial lead were removed. Then, by right jugular approach, the freely floating end of the inner atrial coil was grasped by a pig-tail catheter, drawn back into the superior vena cava, exteriorized by a Lasso catheter, and finally extracted.",2007,Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE
Too many covariates and too few cases? - a comparative study.,"Prior research indicates that 10-15 cases or controls, whichever fewer, are required per parameter to reliably estimate regression coefficients in multivariable logistic regression models. This condition may be difficult to meet even in a well-designed study when the number of potential confounders is large, the outcome is rare, and/or interactions are of interest. Various propensity score approaches have been implemented when the exposure is binary. Recent work on shrinkage approaches like lasso were motivated by the critical need to develop methods for the p >> n situation, where p is the number of parameters and n is the sample size. Those methods, however, have been less frequently used when pâ‰ˆn, and in this situation, there is no guidance on choosing among regular logistic regression models, propensity score methods, and shrinkage approaches. To fill this gap, we conducted extensive simulations mimicking our motivating clinical data, estimating vaccine effectiveness for preventing influenza hospitalizations in the 2011-2012 influenza season. Ridge regression and penalized logistic regression models that penalize all but the coefficient of the exposure may be considered in these types of studies.

Oscillation of Metropolis-Hastings and simulated annealing algorithms around LASSO estimator,"In this work we study, as the temperature goes to zero, the oscillation of a family of Gibbs measures around LASSO estimator.

Finally we apply these results to analyse the convergence of Metropolisâ€“Hastings and simulated annealing algorithms.",2017,Math. Comput. Simul.
Educational debts incurred by racism and sexism in studentsâ€™ beliefs about physics,"The American Physical Society calls on its members to improve the diversity of physics by supporting an inclusive culture that encourages women and people of color to become physicists. Becoming a physicist demands a set of beliefs about what it means to learn and do physics. Rather than physics courses and degree programs supporting students in developing these beliefs, evidence shows that physics education filters out students without sufficient beliefs. To better understand the role of beliefs in the lack of diversity in physics, we investigated the intersectional nature of race/racism and gender/sexism in inequities in student beliefs towards learning and doing physics using a critical quantitative intersectionality framework. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine studentsâ€™ beliefs as measured by the Colorado learning attitudes about science survey. The data came from the LASSO database and included 1248 students in 29 calculus-based mechanics courses. Like prior studies, we found that beliefs either did not change or slightly decreased for most groups. Results identified large differences across intersecting race and gender groups. White students, particularly White men, tended to have more expert-like beliefs than any other group of students. Physics instruction must address these educational debts to move toward an inclusive culture supportive of diverse students and professionals.",2020,

High-dimensional compositional microbiota data: state-of-the-art of methods and software implementations,"Compositional data (CoDa) consist of a collection of nonnegative measurements that sum to a constant value, typically, proportions that sum to 1. Because knowing the sum, one component can be determined from the sum of the remainder, the parts that make up the composition are mathematically and statistically dependent. This distinct structure complicates analysis and does not allow standard statistical analyses. Aitchison (JRSS-B, 1982) and Egozcue and colleagues (Math. Geol., 2003), among others, provided a framework to analyze CoDa by mapping data from the constrained simplex space to the Euclidian space using nonlinear transforms such as the log-odds or the isometric log-ratio transforms. The increasing quality/reducing cost of high-throughput sequencing technology, in particular, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the bacterial component of the human microbial community (microbiota), has enabled researchers to investigate human diseases. Subsequently, microbiota has been associated with numerous diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, cancer and cystic fibrosis. Because of the compositional structure and the high-dimensional data generated by microbiota sequencing, there is also a parallel development of specific statistical analysis methods and computational tools. Microbiota are usually measured as relative abundance of species and analyzed as CoDa. The objectives of this work are the following: - First, to review theory and usage of CoDa analysis in the microbiota setting, with particular emphasis on recent proposals adapted to high-dimensional problems (e.g. supervised â€“constrained Lasso, hierarchical Lasso, kernel methods, sPLS, or unsupervised â€“ PCoA, PCA, Sparse inverse covariance estimation).- Second, to investigate the current state-of-the-art software implementations (basically, R packages: compositions, vegan, ALDex2, PERMANOVA, MiRKAT, MixMC . . . )- Third, using toy examples and publicly available data (the 16S data from the Koren and colleaguesâ€™ study in March 2011â€™s PNAS, available in the MixMC R package), to implement and evaluate those methods with publicly available codes. Evaluation criteria are mainly based oncomputational and practical aspects.",2017,
Hyperspectral data compression using lasso algorithm for spectral decorrelation,"Among discrete orthogonal transforms, Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) achieves the most optimal spectral decorrelation for hyperspectral data compression with minimum mean square error. A common approach for those spectral decorrelation transform techniques such as KLT is to select m coefficient using some threshold value and then treating the rest of the coefficients as zero, this will result in loss of information. In order to preserve more information on small target data, this paper focused on a new technique called joint KLT-Lasso. The Lasso was applied to KLT coefficient. Sparse loadings were obtained using the Lasso constraint on KLT regression coefficients and more coefficients were shrunk to exact zero. The goal of our new method is to introduce a limit on the sum of the absolute values of the KLT coefficients and in which some coefficients consequently become zero without using any threshold value. A simulation on different hyperspectral data showed encouraging results.",2014,

Systematic Comparison of Machine Learning Methods for Identification of miRNA Species as Disease Biomarkers,"Micro RNA (miRNA) plays important roles in a variety of biological processes and can act as disease biomarkers. Thus, establishment of discovery methods to detect disease-related miRNAs is warranted. Human omics data including miRNA expression profiles have orders of magnitude with much more number of descriptors (p) than that of samples (n), which is so called â€œp > > n problemâ€. Since traditional statistical methods mislead to localized solutions, application of machine learning (ML) methods that handle sparse selection of the variables are expected to solve this problem. Among many ML methods, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) give a few variables from the result of supervised learning with endpoints such as human disease statuses. Here, we performed systematic comparison of LASSO and MARS to discover biomarkers, using six miRNA expression data sets of human disease samples, which were obtained from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We additionally conducted partial least square method discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), as a control traditional method to evaluate baseline performance of discriminant methods. We observed that LASSO and MARS showed relatively higher performance compared to that of PLS-DA, as the number of the samples increases. Also, some of the identified miRNA species by ML methods have already been reported as candidate disease biomarkers in the previous biological studies. These findings should contribute to the extension of our knowledge on ML method performances in empirical utilization of clinical data.",2015,
Variable Selection underMeasurement Error: Comparingthe Performance of SubsetSelection and Shrinkage Methods,"In order to compare the performances of subset selection methods best subset and stepwise selection with shrinkage methods ridge and lasso under measurement error, I studied their median mean-squared errors of predictions and average number of zero-covariates of resulting models. I simulated data for a small number of large effects, a small to moderate number of medium-sized effects and a large number of small effects for three different kinds of classical measurement error. Cases were additional measurement error with homoscedastic, additional with heteroscedastic, and multiplicative with homoscedastic error structure. Underlying relationship between response and latent variables was linear. For the first case predictions based on both shrinkage methods show the tendency to have lower median MSEâ€™s than subset selection methods. On a confidence level of 90%, ridge performs significantly better than best subset for all three kinds of effects. It was evident that with both non-present and present error subset selection methods tend to return more sparse models in average than lasso. Still there was no overall tendency for the models to inor exclude more variables. The second case where the error structure was heteroscedastic and dependant on the latent variable shows similar results. Generally with shrinkage methods there tend to be more accurate predictions than with subset selection. Ridge returns significantly lower median MSEâ€™s than best subset on a 90% confidence level for all analysed effects; with medium-sized and small effects, lasso does so as well. Again, both subset selection methods return more parsimonious models in average than lasso even under measurement error. With a multiplicative measurement error and constant variance there was no significant difference (confidence level 95%) between the median MSEâ€™s of the methods, for any kind of effect used. Unlike in the additive cases, compared to non-present measurement error there wasnâ€™t as much change in which methods performed best or worst. The average number of zero-coefficients didnâ€™t change as drastically as well; subset selection methods keep to return more parsimonious models. Concluding: when it is known or assumed that classical measurement error is present, best subset should probably avoided as it was shown that this method sometimes results in significantly higher MSEâ€™s than other methods. For more accurate predictions shrinkage methods tend to suit best; for sparse models stepwise selection does.",2016,
Surgical reconstruction in intrinsic palsy of the fingers. A study of hundred cases.,"The authors analyze the results obtained by surgical treatment in 100 cases of intrinsic palsy of the hand. The distribution of the surgical procedures performed under regional anesthesia was as follows: Brand II: 41, Palande's lasso: 14, Zancolli: 15, Palande: 13, Littler: 13, Brand I: 2. Results were satisfactory in 74 p. cent, unchanged in 20 p. cent and poor in 6 p. cent of cases. The analysis of this series showed a significant difference in the results obtained in the little finger with better results when Palande's and the lasso procedures were used (for the hand in the lumbrical and open positions).

Phase separationâ€”a strategy to resist autophagic degradation under heat stress,"Stress spans our whole lives. When exposed to stressful conditions, every life, from a worm to a human, adjusts its internal properties to adapt to new environments. This principle applies to adults, and is also essential during development in animals. Dr. Zhang and coworkers from Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences made a remarkable discovery showing that heat-stress-triggered accumulation of PGL granules is an adaptive response to maintain embryonic viability (Figure 1). Their work was published in the September 6th issue of Cell, entitled â€œmTOR regulates phase separation of PGL granules to modulate their autophagic degradationâ€ (Zhang et al., 2018). Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a physical chemistry phenomenon, has been recently recognized as a general mechanism to drive the assembly of many membrane-less compartments in cells, including mitotic spindles, nucleoli, various cellular bodies and RNA-enriched granules (e.g., P granules, stress granules), and signal transduction machineries (e.g., postsynaptic densities (PSD), T cell signaling pathway) (Banani et al., 2017; Bergeron-Sandoval et al., 2016; Hyman et al., 2014; Shin et al., 2017). With distinct components and defined boundaries, these membrane-less compartments act as unique reaction chambers by condensing functionally-linked biomolecules in a spatiotemporal manner in living cells for specific cellular functions. The condensed biomolecules within these liquid-like compartments are dynamic, undergoing rapid exchanges with the surrounding environment, and thus are sensitive to environmental changes or stimulating signals. Such phase-separated, liquid-like structures can transit into more complicated stable structures by further recruiting related components (Zeng et al., 2018), and can also convert into less dynamic gel-like or even solid-state structures (Patel et al., 2015). However, few pieces of work elucidated the relationship between the biophysical properties of droplets with their biological functions. Additionally, a hardened gellike state does not always mean a less dynamic and functionally impaired state. Mutations in FUS lead to liquid-tosolid phase transition and accelerated stress granule accumulation, which is likely associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis (Patel et al., 2015). Whereas during PSD formation, recruiting more PSD components drives the liquid phase to semi-glassor solid-like networks, but such PSD networks are still dynamic and critical for synaptic plasticity (Zeng et al., 2018). In this study, the authors show that PGL-1 and PGL-3, key components of the germline P granule, undergo LLPS in vitro, and the receptor protein SEPA-1 promotes the PGL-1/3 condensates to form PGL granules. The scaffold protein EPG-2 non-homogeneously coats the surface of the SEPA-1/ PGL-1/-3 droplets through SEPA-1, thus reducing the size of droplets, in part by inhibiting the droplet fusion. EPG-2 decoration somehow converts the liquid phase PGL granules into less dynamic gel-like structures, and leads to their au-",2018,Science China Life Sciences
Penalized Variable Selection Procedure for Cox Models with Semiparametric Relative Risk.,"We study the Cox models with semiparametric relative risk, which can be partially linear with one nonparametric component, or multiple additive or nonadditive nonparametric components. A penalized partial likelihood procedure is proposed to simultaneously estimate the parameters and select variables for both the parametric and the nonparametric parts. Two penalties are applied sequentially. The first penalty, governing the smoothness of the multivariate nonlinear covariate effect function, provides a smoothing spline ANOVA framework that is exploited to derive an empirical model selection tool for the nonparametric part. The second penalty, either the smoothly-clipped-absolute-deviation (SCAD) penalty or the adaptive LASSO penalty, achieves variable selection in the parametric part. We show that the resulting estimator of the parametric part possesses the oracle property, and that the estimator of the nonparametric part achieves the optimal rate of convergence. The proposed procedures are shown to work well in simulation experiments, and then applied to a real data example on sexually transmitted diseases.",2010,Annals of statistics
"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induces gonad reversal in a protogynous fish, the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum (Teleostei, Labridae).","Female to male successive hermaphroditism (protogyny) is common in several groups of marine fish. Thalassoma bifasciatum, the bluehead wrasse (Labridae), found in the reefs of the Caribbean normally undergoes sex reversal after receiving behavioral cues. This report deals with the successful use of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in inducing gonad reversal in this species. Eighty percent (n = 40) of the treated fish showed signs of reversal in 1-6 weeks; only 11% (n = 54) of the control (nontreated) group showed signs of reversal during the same period. The number of fish undergoing reversal increased with the length of the treatment period, 55% after 1 week, 100% after 6 weeks. A bluehead color pattern, typical of the terminal male phase, also appeared more frequently in the longer treated groups. To determine the efficacy of hCG in inducing gonad reversal, morphological criteria for reversal had to be established. For the majority of treated fish, the presence of both spermatogenic cysts and degenerating oocytes was sufficient to label these gonads unambiguously as undergoing reversal. However, at the extremes of this process, i.e., onset (early) and endpoint (late) stages, ambiguity could arise in identifying a gonad as undergoing reversal, and, therefore, key criteria were established for these stages. In our hands, the most consistent and reliable criterion for the early stage reversal was appearance of male germ line cells, clusters of ""spermatogonial-like"" cells. For the late stage, recognizable remnants of late-state oocytes had to be present. Some details of the histological changes that occur during early, middle, and late stages of reversal are also described. It is suggested that these results with hCG shed new light on the endocrine control of gonad reversal in T. bifasciatum.",1989,The Journal of experimental zoology

Foreword to the Research Front on â€˜Mineralâ€“Organic Interactions in Aqueous Systemsâ€™,"The mineralâ€“water interface exhibits great diversity in surface functional group composition and associated reactivity towards inorganic and organic solutes that occur in natural soil, sediment and water. Chemical processes of environmental significance involving oxidationâ€“reduction, adsorptionâ€“desorption, and dissolutionâ€“nucleation are promoted by these interfaces because of their propensity for acidâ€“base, ionor ligandexchange, and redox reactions.Mineral surface hydroxyl groups of iron, aluminium and manganese (oxyhydr)oxides and siloxane groups of layered aluminosilicates, for example, are known to exhibit a range in affinities for reactionwith protons, hydroxyl ions, metals, oxyanions, and aqueous organic species and their complexes. The environmental implications of mineral surface chemistry are manifold and diverse. They include atmospheric CO2 drawdown associated with silicate mineral dissolution, removal from solution of adsorptive metal and oxyanion contaminants, nutrient retention for plant growth and organic matter stabilisation against microbial biodegradation. Through a combination of macroscopic experiments, molecular spectroscopy studies, and molecular modelling, environmental chemists are developing an improved understanding of the molecular-scale controls over the rates and extents of mineral surface reactions. This Research Front presents six contributions discussing various aspects of mineral surface reactions and their environmental relevance using experimental, spectroscopic and simulation methods. The Research Front begins with a review by Casey on the mechanisms and kinetics of ligand exchange reactions at mineral surfaces. This paper discusses reactivity trends for ligand and oxygen isotope exchanges in nanometresized molecular clusters and larger mineral structures from the perspective of coordination chemistry. It provides examples of how an understanding of exchange reactions in the molecular clusters can shed light on reaction kinetics of broad environmental relevance, such as those for mineral dissolution and metalâ€“ligand complex formation in aqueous solutions. The second paper, a review by Stack and Kent, discusses how computational modelling, specifically molecular dynamics and quantum chemical simulations, can be used to build insightful kinetic models of mineral surface reactions. Illustrative examples are presented for water ligand exchange, adsorption, crystal growth, dissolution and electron transfer. Interfacial reactions are strongly affected by the speciation of aqueous phase reactants as shown in the third paper, authored by Carbonaro and Stone. This study, which evaluates mineralsurface-mediated rates of Cr oxidation to Cr during surface reaction with hydrous Mn oxide, shows that Cr-chelating ligands alter the pH-dependent kinetics of oxidation. This is important, because most soil systems contain natural organic matter (NOM) that can form stable complexes with polyvalent metals. The fourth paper by Pasakarnis et al. builds on prior work of the Scherer group demonstrating electron transfer between adsorbed Fe and underlying Fe oxide surfaces. In the former paper, the authors obtained a combination of isotopic and spectroscopic data that show that introduction of NOM components can alter the Fe atom exchange rate â€“ an observation that the authors argue has potential relevance to long-term, mineralassociated stabilisation of organic matter in soils. The issue of NOM stabilisation at mineral surfaces is explored further in the paper by Chen and Sparks. Employing STXM-NEXAFS spectroscopy to assess organo-mineral associations in soils from reducing environments depleted of Fe oxides, they found that NOM composition was highly variable at the submicrometre scale and exhibited no discernible pattern with inorganic element distributions. The sixth and final paper of the Research Front focuses on the role of mineral surface chemistry in adsorption of novel energetic compounds, a diverse class of emerging organic contaminants. The findings of Linker et al., highlight the importance of compatibility between the functional group chemistries of adsorbate and adsorbent in controlling the extent and hysteresis of the adsorption reaction. Although this Research Front only â€˜scratches the surfaceâ€™ of work pertaining to the mineralâ€“organic interface, I hope that it represents the multitude of interactions that are being probed using complementary experimental and modelling approaches. I thank all of the authors for their valuable contributions to this important area of research.",2015,Environmental Chemistry
Local likelihood disease clustering: development and evaluation,"This paper illustrates a method based on local likelihood (LL) for detecting disease clusters. The approach is based on estimating a lasso distance for each region: within which regions are considered to be clustered. An important advantage in implementing this approach is that it does not require any special Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm, e.g., reversible jump MCMC, which is essential in hidden Markov model approach. Another advantage is that extending the model to incorporate covariates is straightforward. We illustrate three ways of doing this by using Eastern Germany lip cancer data. By using simulated data, we have made a comparison with the BYM model [Besag et al. (1991) Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, 43, 1â€“59] and the mixture model [Lawson and Clark (2002) Disease Mapping and Risk Assessment for Public Health, Chapman and Hall]. We also did a limited examination of the ability of the LL model to recover true relative risk under different priors for lasso parameter. In order to check the edge effects, which has been overlooked in many spatial clustering models for disease mapping but deserves special attention as it lacks observable neighbors, we have adapted here a simple approach to observe the changes in relative risks when the edge regions are omitted.",2005,Environmental and Ecological Statistics
