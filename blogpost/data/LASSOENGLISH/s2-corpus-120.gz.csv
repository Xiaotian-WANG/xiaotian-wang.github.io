Tailored Graphical Lasso for Data Integration in Gene Network Reconstruction,"Conventional differential gene expression analysis by methods such as SAM (Chu et al., 2001), studentâ€™s t-test and Empirical Bayes (Efron et al., 2001) often searches for statistically significant genes without considering the interactions among them. Approaches based on network models provide a way to study these interactions, and by assuming a Gaussian graphical model a gene association network may be estimated from genomic data based on the non-zero entries of the inverse covariance matrix. Inferring such biological networks is challenging because of the high dimensionality of the problem, making traditional estimators unsuitable. The graphical lasso, proposed by Friedman et al. (2008), is constructed for the estimation of sparse inverse covariance matrices in Gaussian graphical models in such situations, using L1-penalization on the matrix entries. Extentions of the graphical lasso include the weighted graphical lasso (Li and Jackson, 2015), in which prior biological knowledge is incorporated into the model. There are however problems with this approach, as it naÃ¯vely forces prior information into the model even if it worsens the results. Further, if an associated network is used as the prior the method often fails to utilize the information efficiently. We propose modifications to this method that aim to handle prior information of unknown accuracy. As a result, we get a method that utilizes useful prior knowledge more efficiently yet does not involve any risk of loss of accuracy should the prior information be wrongful.",2019,
Delayed Surgical Reconstruction of a Peroneal Tendon Rupture in an Accessory Os PeroneumA Rare Differential Diagnosis in Chronic Ankle Pain.,"A fracture of the os peroneum is a rare cause of ankle and foot pain and is often overlooked and not assumed. Only a few case reports have discussed the different etiologies, options for diagnosis, and therapeutic interventions for acute cases. We present a case of delayed diagnosis of an os peroneum fracture due to a distortion of the ankle that occurred during air sports. Initial diagnostic testing with magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a rupture of the peroneus longus tendon with no pathologic abnormalities at the peroneus brevis tendon. During surgery, a combination of an os peroneum fracture and a peroneus brevis tendon split was found and was successfully treated with bone and tendon repair using a lasso stich technique.",2016,Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association
News and Comments,"Clinical Update: ImpactofHIV Protease Inhibitorson the TreatmentofHIV-Infected Tuberculosis Patients withRijampin In 1995and 1996,the Foodand Drug Administration (FDA)approvedthree products in the new proteaseinhibitorclass of drugs saquinavir, ritonavir, and indinavir. Anotherdrug in thisclassof agents, nelfinavir (Viracept, Agouron Pharmaceuticals), is expectedto be available soon.All four drugs,whichinhibitHIV proteaseand thus interfere withviralmaturation and replication, are the most potentantiretroviral agentsavailable to treatpatientswith HIV. However, theseproteaseinhibitors interactwith rifamycin derivatives, such as rifampin and rifabutin. Rifamycins accelerate the metabolism of proteaseinhibitors (through induction of hepaticP450cytochrome oxidases), resulting in subtherapeutic concentrations of the proteaseinhibitors. In addition, proteaseinhibitors retardthe metabolism of rifamycins, resulting in increasedserumconcentrations of rifamycins and the likelihood of increaseddrug toxicity. . Currently, the manufacturers' productlabeling for protease inhibitors contraindicates, does not recommend, or discourages theconcurrent administration of rifampin and proteaseinhibitors. Becauseof the common association of TB and HIV infection, an increasing numberof patients probably will be considered candidates for rifampin and protease inhibitors.In addition, all HIV-infected patientsat risk for TB infection should be evaluated and administered isoniazid for preventive treatment if indicated,regardless of theirstatusfor beingprescribed proteaseinhibitor therapy. For HIV-infected patients diagnosed withdrug-susceptible TB and for whomproteaseinhibitortherapyis beingconsidered, thesuggested management strategyis to completeTB treatment witha regimen containing rifampin beforestarting therapywitha proteaseinhibitor. The duration of thisanti-TB regimen is at least6 months, and therapy should be administered following currentguidelines published by the American ThoracicSocietyand the Centersfor DiseaseControland Prevention (CDC).Antiretroviral agentsother than protease inhibitors may be used concurrently with this regimen. Directly observedtherapy is routinely recommended for the treatment ofTB to ensureadherence with the recommended regimen. Amongpatientswho adhereto therapy, four-drug regimens are expectedto be effectiveeven in thoseinfected with strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid or streptomycin alone.However, the management of patientswithdrug-resistant TB shouldbe evaluatedon a case-by-case basisand individualized on the basisof drug-susceptibility studies. Thereare threeoptionsfor managing HIV-infected patientswithTB who are undergoing proteaseinhibitor therapy whenTB is diagnosed. Becausethe risksand benefitsof all theseoptionsare unknown, cliniciansshouldindividualize decisions on a case-by-case basis. OptionI. Thisoptioninvolves discontinuing therapy with the protease inhibitorand completing a short(minimum 6 mo) courseofTB treatmentwitha regimencontaining rifampin. This anti-TB regimenshould be administered following currentguidelines published by the American ThoracicSocietyand the CDC,and the duration of therapy shouldbe prolonged in patients withslow or suboptimal responses. Proteaseinhibitortherapy may be resumedwhen treatment with rifampin is discontinued. Antiretroviral agentsother than proteaseinhibitors may be used concurrently withrifampin. Although the risksassociated witha completediscontinuation of protease inhibitortherapywhileundergoing TB treatment are unclear, they may be serious; however, the risksand complications associated withTB treatment regimens thatdo not includerifampinare known.Therefore, nonrifampin-containing regimens are not recommended for the treatment of rifampin-susceptible TB. OptionII. To minimize the interruption of protease inhibitortherapy, .one optionis to use a four-drug TB treatment regimenthat includesrifampinfor a minimumof 2 monthsand untilbacteriologic response is achieved(i.e.,sputumconversion to culture-negative status), and the resultsfromsusceptibility testingare available. Afterbacteriologic responseand drug susceptibility have beendocumented (usually3 mo), treatment may be modified to a 16-month continuation-phase regimen consisting of isoniazid 15mg/kgand ethambutol 50 mg/kgtwo times per week.This regimen allowsthe reintroduction of proteaseinhibitor therapy. Someexpertsconsultedfor this reportrecommended addinga thirddrug, suchas streptomycin, duringthiscontinuation phaseif the infecting organismis not resistant to the drug.OptionII cannotbe recommendedfor patientswith provenisoniazid-resistant TB. OptionIII.The other management optionis to continueproteaseinhibitortherapywith indinavir 800 mg q8h and administer a four-drug, 9monthTB treatment regimen containing daily rifabutin 150mg instead of rifampin. When thisoptionis usedfor TB management, clinicians shouldconductcarefulmonitoring, possibly including measuring serum concentrations of rifabutin. An international multicenter studyindicated thata 6-monthregimen containing rifabutin, at the dailydosageof either 150or 300 mg, was as effective for treating TB as a similarregimen containing rifampin. In a smallclinicaltrial,a rifabutin-containing regimen waseffective in TB in patients coinfected with HIY. In addition, limiteddata frompharmacokinetic studiessuggestthat the combination of rifabutin 150mg/dand indinavirresulted in acceptable concentrations of bothdrugs.OptionIII cannotbe recommended for patientsundergoing therapy with ritonavir or saquinavir. For thesepatients, the decision to changethe prescribed proteaseinhibitorto indinavirand to prescribe rifabutin forTB therapy shouldbe made in consultation withan expert in the useof proteaseinhibitors to manageHIV infection. NeitheroptionII noroptionIII has beenstudiedin largeclinicaltrials of HIV-infected patients or patientsundergoing protease inhibitortherapy duringTB treatment. For thesereasons, if eitherof theseoptionsare selected for managing patientswithTB, the CDC recommends the followinginterimguidelines untiladditional data are available and formal guidelines are issued: (1) on initiation of therapy, performfrequent bacteriologic evaluations to document sputumconversion to culture-negativestatus,and aftercultureconversion, to detectany possible treatment failures; (2) extendtheduration of therapy to at least 18monthsfor option II or 9 monthsfor optionIII; (3) useonly indinavirwithoptionIII; (4)carefullymonitorfor drug toxicity; (5) usedirectlyobservedtherapy throughout; and (6) reevaluate periodically duringthe first2 yearsafter completion of therapy(including an assessment of bacteriologic statusat 6 mo) and instructpatients to promptly reportsymptoms compatible with relapseof TB. The management of HlV-infected patientsdiagnosedwithdrug-resistant TB or diagnosed clinically withTB but without cultureand susceptibility-testing resultsshouldbe evaluated on a case-by-case basisand performed in consultation witha TB expert. Interactions betweenprotease inhibitors and the rifamycins also have complicated prophylaxis and treatment for disseminated Mycobacterium aviumcomplex(MAC)disease. Rifabutin is one of thedrugsrecommendedfor MAC prophylaxis. According to the manufacturer of indinavir,rifabutin at half the dose (150 mg)can be usedfor MAC prophy-",1997,Annals of Pharmacotherapy
A novel SCCA approach via truncated â„“1-norm and truncated group lasso for brain imaging genetics,"Motivation
Brain imaging genetics, which studies the linkage between genetic variations and structural or functional measures of the human brain, has become increasingly important in recent years. Discovering the bi-multivariate relationship between genetic markers such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and neuroimaging quantitative traits (QTs) is one major task in imaging genetics. Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) has been a popular technique in this area for its powerful capability in identifying bi-multivariate relationships coupled with feature selection. The existing SCCA methods impose either the â„“ 1 -norm or its variants to induce sparsity. The â„“ 0 -norm penalty is a perfect sparsity-inducing tool which, however, is an NP-hard problem.


Results
In this paper, we propose the truncated â„“ 1 -norm penalized SCCA to improve the performance and effectiveness of the â„“ 1 -norm based SCCA methods. Besides, we propose an efficient optimization algorithms to solve this novel SCCA problem. The proposed method is an adaptive shrinkage method via tuning Ï„ . It can avoid the time intensive parameter tuning if given a reasonable small Ï„ . Furthermore, we extend it to the truncated group-lasso (TGL), and propose TGL-SCCA model to improve the group-lasso-based SCCA methods. The experimental results, compared with four benchmark methods, show that our SCCA methods identify better or similar correlation coefficients, and better canonical loading profiles than the competing methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods in discovering interesting imaging genetic associations.

Machine Learning Assisted MRI Characterization for Diagnosis of Neonatal Acute Bilirubin Encephalopathy,"Background: The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosis of neonatal acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) in newborns has been limited by its difficulty in differentiating confounding image contrast changes associated with normal myelination. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of building a machine learning prediction model based on radiomics features derived from MRI to better characterize and distinguish ABE from normal myelination. Methods: In this retrospective study, we included 32 neonates with clinically confirmed ABE and 29 age-matched controls with normal myelination. Radiomics features were extracted from the manually segmented region of interest (ROI) on T1-weighted spin echo images, followed by the feature selection using two-sample independent t-test, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression, and Pearson's correlation matrix. Additional feature quantifying the relative mean intensity of ROI was defined and calculated. A prediction model based on the selected features was built to classify ABE and normal myelination using multiple machine learning classifiers and a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the prediction performance with the area under the curve (AUC) and feature importance ranked based on the Fisher score. Results: Among 1319 radiomics features, one radiologist-defined intensity-based feature and 12 texture features were selected as the most discriminative features. Based on these features, decision trees had the best classification performance with the largest AUC of 0.946, followed by support vector machine (SVM), tree-bagger, logistic regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, discriminant analysis, and k-nearest neighborhood (KNN), which have an AUC of 0.931, 0.925, 0.905, 0.891, 0.883, and 0.817, respectively. The relative mean intensity outperformed other 12 texture features in differentiating ABE from controls. Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrated a new strategy of characterizing ABE-induced intensity and morphological changes in MRI, which are difficult to be recognized, interpreted, or quantified by the routine experience and visual-based reading strategy. With more quantitative and objective measurements, the reported machine learning assisted radiomics features-based approach can improve the diagnosis and support clinical decision-making.",2019,Frontiers in Neurology
Real time change-point detection in a model by adaptive LASSO and CUSUM,"In this paper, the CUSUM test statistic based on adaptive LASSO residuals is proposed and studied for detecting in real time a change-point in a linear model with a large number of explanatory variables. 
Under null hypothesis that the model does not change, the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is determined. Under alternative hypothesis that at some unknown observation there is a change in model, the proposed test statistic converges in probability to $\infty$. These results allow to build an asymptotic critical region. Next, in order to improve the test statistic performance a modified test statistic is proposed. 
Simulation results, using Monte Carlo technique, illustrate the performance of the proposed test statistic. We also compare it with the classical CUSUM test statistic.",2015,
How innovation platforms can facilitate sustainable intensification? Insights from multi-level systems research in West-Africa,"As new instruments for agricultural policies, innovation platforms (IP) are experienced for over a decade. They reflect the evolutions in frameworks for thinking the drivers of agricultural development. Notably, researchers are supposed to become actors among others and no more be the only ones to produce useful knowledge. In West Africa, IPs are mainly promoted in two forms: ""value chains approach-based"" IP that aim at improving productivity, competitiveness and markets, and ""agricultural research-oriented"" IP that aim at designing and transferring new agricultural practices. In both cases, researchers still face many demands for designing, implementing or facilitating IPs. In order to explore the pertinence of these instruments as regards sustainable intensification processes (SI) in west-African savannah, the ASAP research platform gathering five national and international research centers (IER, IDR, CIRAD, CIRDES, INERA) organized a seminar in Bobo-Dioulasso in 2013. The objectives were to take stock of i) systems research results on innovation processes that contribute to SI, ii) lessons from the experimentations of IPs set up in different countries (Burkina, Mali, Niger, Senegal). Then we explored the possible functions of IPs in SI processes and we examined implications for researchers to achieve the high expectations that are being laid at their door. Two main functions have been identified, according to the nature of innovations and the step of SI process itself: 1) either SI is breaking with the dominant agricultural model. IP functions are threefold: give sense to SI; create multi-actor partnerships based on long-term commitment to change and a way to collectively go-on through adaptive management; facilitate farmer-led innovation processes. 2) Or SI is in continuity with dominant agricultural dynamics. IP mainly aims at accelerating innovation processes through the facilitation of informal multi-actor arrangements and of knowledge exchanges between converging local innovation systems. We showed how the diversity of systems research methods produced by ASAP research platform enables to produce useful tools and knowledge to help the implementation of these different IPs. However we also highlighted a number of areas for future research and capacity building issues for researchers if they are to play their part to the full. (Resume d'auteur)",2015,
Intelligent modeling of rheological and thermophysical properties of green covalently functionalized graphene nanofluids containing nanoplatelets,"Abstract Regarding the importance of accurate predictions in industrial applications, this research aims to investigate the ability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to carry out modeling and multi-criteria optimization of the rheological and thermophysical properties of an environmentally-friendly covalently functionalized nanofluid containing graphene nanoplatelets (CGNPs). In this contribution, different ANN structures are assessed and the NNs with 2-7-1, 2-4-1, 2-7-1 and 2-5-1 structures having a linear transfer function (purelin) and a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid (tansig) transfer function in the output and hidden layer are found to give the least difference between the network outputs and the experimental data for the thermal conductivity, viscosity, specific heat capacity, and density, respectively. Moreover, new correlations for thermal conductivity and viscosity of the nanofluid are proposed and the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) methods are also presented for comparative purposes. It is observed that all models performed in a very comparable fashion, giving an idea of the easy nature of the problem. So it is recommended to train simple linear models like LASSO or SVM for such problems and perhaps the complex NNs are not necessary in some cases of practical prediction applications such as cooling or heating systems containing nanofluids. Furthermore, finding the optimal conditions is another crucial aspect of engineering problems. In this regard, a multi-criteria optimization of the hydrothermal characteristics of the nanofluid (i.e., to find the optimal cases with highest thermal conductivity and the relatively least viscosity) is conducted using the genetic algorithm coupled with a compromise programming approach.",2018,International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer
"Systematics and Ecology of a New Species of Seagrass (Thalassodendron, Cymodoceaceae) from Southeast African Coasts","Abstract.â€ƒ Tropical seagrass communities are one of the most productive aquatic ecosystems on earth. A high diversity of seagrass species occurs in southeastern Africa; however, these marine angiosperms are among the least studied in the world. To address this, we have revised Thalassodendron Hartog (Cymodoceaceae), one of the most representative seagrasses in these coastal waters. Morpho-anatomical analyses, complemented with field data, reveal that specimens from rocky habitats present a number of distinguishing characters (e.g., rhizome internode lengths, leaf epidermal cells, and flower structures) that recommend their exclusion from the species T. ciliatum (Forssk.) Hartog. A new species from rocky habitats, T. leptocaule Maria C. Duarte, Bandeira & Romeiras, is thus described and illustrated, with the type from Mozambique, and an identification key for the investigated taxa is presented.",2012,
Composite quantile regression and variable selection of the partial linear single-index models,"In this paper, we propose a composite minimizing average check loss estimation(CMACLE) method for the composite quantile regression(CQR) of the partial linear single-index model(PLSIM) by local linear method. Based on constructive approach, the estimators by CMACLE are able to achieve the best convergence rate. The asymptotical normalities of the estimators are also derived. Meanwhile, the asymptotic efficiency of the CQR estimation relative to the mean regression are investigated. Further more, we propose a variable selection method for the CQR of PLSIM by combining the CMACLE procedure with the adaptive LASSO penalized method. The oracle properties of the proposed variable selection method are also established. Simulations with various non-normal errors and a real data analysis are conducted to assess the finite sample property of the proposed estimation and variable selection methods.",2014,
A New Narrow-Toed Frog from Andean Ecuador (Leptodactylidae: Eleutherodactylus),"Eleutherodactylus elassodiscus sp. nov. is found at intermediate elevations (1700-2600 m) on the northern Amazonian slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes. The species is distinctive in having non-dilated digital pads, the thumb longer than the second finger, and smooth skin on the venter. Its closest ally is probably E. nigrovittatus. E. elassodiscus is structurally intermediate between the predominantly tropical lowland E. binotatus group and some elements of the Andean genus Niceforonia (e.g. N. flavomaculata).",1973,Copeia
Gorgonolaureus bicornutus sp. nov (Crustacea: Thecostraca: Ascothoracida) from off South-East Taiwan with notes on morphology and distribution.,"A new ascothoracidan species, Gorgonolaureus bicornutus sp. nov., has been discovered off south-eastern Taiwan at a depth of 227 m. Five females were found in permanent cysts on the branches of a plexaurid octocoralian alcyonacean (former ""gorgonian""), Echinogorgia sp. These specimens are assigned to the genus Gorgonolaureus on account of their having an enlarged and inflated carapace with a long, slit-like aperture, long dorsal thoracic horns, no filamentary appendages associated with the first pair of thoracopods, and rudimentary telsonic spines. Gorgonolaureus bicornutus differs from its congeners in having two long, naked dorsal horns on thoracomeres 2 and 3, the number of seminal receptacles in the thoracopods, and the higher number of stout setae on the fifth antennular segment. The characters that unite the genus Gorgonolaureus are redefined as follows: i) the absence of filamentary appendages associated with the first pair of thoracopods; ii) the possession of 1-3 dorsal horns distributed singly among thoracomeres 1-3; iii) the absence of prominent proximal teeth medially on the mandibles; iv) the possession of short or rudimentary telsonic spines; and v) host preference, with most species infecting octocorals of the suborder Halaxonia (mostly of the family Plexauridae) and never the calcaxonian families Chrysogorgiidae and Isididae. The gorgonian-infecting genera Gorgonolaureus and Isidascus are Tethyan relics that have survived only in the Western Pacific and the Eastern Atlantic, respectively, while their relatives in the genera Cardomanica and Thalassomembracis have disjunct Western Atlantic/Western Pacific distributions, thus exemplifying a major pattern of Tethyan reliction.",2015,Zootaxa
Short-Term Demand Prediction Method for Online Car-Hailing Services Based on a Least Squares Support Vector Machine,"The purpose of this paper is to study the short-term demand prediction for online car-hailing services problem. Prediction of short-term network car demand can provide many benefits such as an increase in the income of network car drivers. In addition, demand prediction is an important resource for recommendation systems, carpooling systems, and network car scheduling; and therefore, predicting the demand for network cars has great significance. In the last few decades, scholars have studied various problems related to short-term demand prediction for online car-hailing services based on clustering algorithms and regression algorithms. However, these studies are still problematic because the accuracy of demand prediction is not high enough. Therefore, this paper studies a method of improving the accuracy and the efficiency of demand prediction. Due to the high prediction accuracy and the fast training efficiency of least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), a short-term demand prediction method for online car-hailing services based on LS-SVM is proposed. The modeling process involves selecting the dependent and independent variables, the basic principles of the LS-SVM, the kernel function and superparameter, model training, and prediction. In a numerical experiment, we use network car order data as the network car demand data to test the model. We show that the experimental results with the LS-SVM method implemented in this paper and then compare the model with lasso linear regression, nearest neighbor regression, decision tree regression, and neural network. The experimental results show that the short-term demand prediction model for online car-hailing services based on LS-SVM performs better than the other methods.",2019,IEEE Access

Long intergenic non-coding RNA detection benefited from integrative modeling of (Epi)genomic data,"Prediction of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) is a prerequisite to analyze sequence features of non-coding RNAs and explore their regulatory function. Genomic sequence features provide fundamental backgrounds for lincRNA predictions, due to that sequence information at least partially aids such predictions. However, genomic sequence alone seems to reach an end involving sensitivity for lincRNA prediction in eukaryotes. Chromatin factors leave marks that can be captured by high-throughput approaches such as ChIP-seq are also important features, as revealed by previous studies. We demonstrate that the performance of lincRNA predictions can be improved when incorporating both high-throughput chromatin modification and genomic sequence features by logistic regression with LASSO regularization. The discriminating features include H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K9me3, Open Reading Frames and several repeat elements. Importantly, chromatin information is suggested to be complementary to genomic sequence information, highlighting the importance of an integrated model. We also show that the lincRNA expression specificity can be efficiently modeled by the chromatin data with same developmental stage. The study not only supports the biological hypothesis that chromatin factors can regulate developmental-stage-specific expression of lincRNAs, also reveals the discriminating features between lincRNA and coding genes.",2013,2013 10th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)
LASSO based Resample Model Averaging for Genetic Association Studies,"JEREMY A. SABOURIN: LASSO based Resample Model Averaging for Genetic Association Studies. (Under the direction of Andrew B. Nobel and William Valdar.) Significance testing one SNP at a time has proven useful for identifying genomic regions that harbor variants affecting human disease. In theory, simultaneous modeling of multiple loci should help when considering complex diseases affected by multiple predictors. However, they are typically applied in an ad hoc fashion: conditioning on the top SNPs, with limited exploration of the model space and no assessment of how sensitive model choice was to sampling variability. Formal alternatives exist but are seldom used. When considering complex traits in humans, the genetic model is most often assumed to be additive only SNP effects. When non-additive effects such as dominance or overdominance are present, additive only models can be underpowered. We first present LLARRMA, a resample model averaging based method using the LASSO that allows for additive. It estimates for each SNP, the probability that it would be included in a multiple SNP model in alternative realizations of the data. We show that under simulations based on real GWAS data, that LLARRMA identifies a set of candidates that is enriched for causal loci relative to single locus analysis. We next generalize the resample model averaging framework and present LLARRMAdawg, a generalized resample model averaging based method using the group LASSO that allows for additive and non-additive SNP effects. We show that under simulations based on real GWAS data, that LLARRMA-dawg identifies a set of candidates that is enriched for causal loci relative to LLARRMA in the presence of non-additive effects. We examine how the framework for LLARRMA-dawg can be extended to other problems where multiple model predictors are required to model the effects of a single variable. The final portion of this dissertation describes additional information that one may explore from resample model averaging. Specifically, we examine how one can identify response specific variable relationships based on the models selected under resampling. This give the researcher further information about the predictors than the standard pairwise correlation structure which does not account for the response.",2013,
"Thalassospira alkalitolerans sp. nov. and Thalassospira mesophila sp. nov., isolated from a decaying bamboo sunken in the marine environment, and emended description of the genus Thalassospira.","Two marine bacteria, designated strains MBE#61(T) and MBE#74(T), were isolated from a piece of sunken bamboo in the marine environment in Japan. Both of these strains were Gram-stain-negative, but had different cell shapes: MBE#61(T) was spiral, whereas MBE#74(T) was rod-shaped. The temperature, pH and salt concentration ranges for growth of strain MBE#61(T) were 4-38 Â°C (optimal at 32 Â°C), pH 4.5-11.0 (optimal at pH 7.0-8.0) and 1-11â€Š% (optimal at 2â€Š%) NaCl, whereas those of strain MBE#74(T) were 4-36 Â°C (optimal at 30 Â°C), pH 4.0-10.5 (optimal at pH 7.0-8.0) and 1-12â€Š% (optimal at 4â€Š%) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that both strains belong to the genus Thalassospira within the class Alphaproteobacteria. Similarity between the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain MBE#61(T) and those of the type strains of species of the genus Thalassospira was 97.5-99.0â€Š%, and that of strain MBE#74(T) was 96.9-98.6â€Š%; these two isolates were most closely related to Thalassospira lucentensis QMT2(T). However, the DNA-DNA hybridization values between T. lucentensis QMT2(T) and strain MBE#61(T) or MBE#74(T) were only 16.0â€Š% and 7.1â€Š%, respectively. The DNA G+C content of strain MBE#61(T) was 54.4 mol%, and that of strain MBE#74(T) was 55.9 mol%. The predominant isoprenoid quinone of the two strains was Q-10 (MBE#61(T), 97.3â€Š%; MBE#74(T), 93.5â€Š%). The major cellular fatty acids of strain MBE#61(T) were C18â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰7c (31.1â€Š%), summed feature 3 comprising C16â€Š:â€Š0Ï‰7c/iso-C15â€Š:â€Š0 2-OH (26.1â€Š%) and C16â€Š:â€Š0 (20.9â€Š%); those of strain MBE#74(T) were C16â€Š:â€Š0 (26.2â€Š%), C17â€Š:â€Š0 cyclo (19.9â€Š%) and C18â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰7c (12.1â€Š%). On the basis of these results, strain MBE#61(T) and strain MBE#74(T) are considered to represent novel species of the genus Thalassospira, for which names Thalassospira alkalitolerans sp. nov. and Thalassospira mesophila sp. nov. are proposed.

Differentially Expressed lncRNAs in Gastric Cancer Patients: A Potential Biomarker for Gastric Cancer Prognosis,"Current studies indicate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are frequently aberrantly expressed in cancers and implicated with prognosis in gastric cancer (GC). We intended to generate a multi-lncRNA signature to improve prognostic prediction of GC. By analyzing ten paired GC and adjacent normal mucosa tissues, 339 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified as the candidate prognostic biomarkers in GC. Then we used LASSO Cox regression method to build a 12-lncRNA signature and validated it in another independent GEO dataset. An innovative 12-lncRNA signature was established, and it was significantly associated with the disease free survival (DFS) in the training dataset. By applying the 12-lncRNA signature, the training cohort patients could be categorized into high-risk or low-risk subgroup with significantly different DFS (HR = 4.52, 95%CI= 2.49-8.20, P < 0.0001). Similar results were obtained in another independent GEO dataset (HR=1.58, 95%CI=1.05 - 2.38, P=0.0270). Further analysis showed that the prognostic value of this 12-lncRNA signature was independent of AJCC stage and postoperative chemotherapy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of combined model reached 0.869. Additionally, a well-performed nomogram was constructed for clinicians. Moreover, single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) showed that a group of pathways related to drug resistance and cancer metastasis significantly enriched in the high risk patients. A useful innovative 12-lncRNA signature was established for prognostic evaluation of GC. It might complement clinicopathological features and facilitate personalized management of GC.",2017,Journal of Cancer
TraRECo: a greedy approach based de novo transcriptome assembler with read error correction using consensus matrix,"BackgroundThe challenges when developing a good de novo transcriptome assembler include how to deal with read errors and sequence repeats. Almost all de novo assemblers utilize a de Bruijn graph, with which complexity grows linearly with data size while suffering from errors and repeats. Although one can correct the errors by inspecting the topological structure of the graph, this is not an easy task when there are too many branches. Two research directions are to improve either the graph reliability or the path search precision, and in this study, we focused on the former.ResultsWe present TraRECo, a greedy approach to de novo assembly employing error-aware graph construction. In the proposed approach, we built contigs by direct read alignment within a distance margin and performed a junction search to construct splicing graphs. While doing so, a contig of length l was represented by a 4 Ã— l matrix (called a consensus matrix), in which each element was the base count of the aligned reads so far. A representative sequence was obtained by taking the majority in each column of the consensus matrix to be used for further read alignment. Once the splicing graphs had been obtained, we used IsoLasso to find paths with a noticeable read depth. The experiments using real and simulated reads show that the method provided considerable improvement in sensitivity and moderately better performance when comparing sensitivity and precision. This was achieved by the error-aware graph construction using the consensus matrix, with which the reads having errors were made usable for the graph construction (otherwise, they might have been eventually discarded). This improved the quality of the coverage depth information used in the subsequent path search step and finally the reliability of the graph.ConclusionsDe novo assembly is mainly used to explore undiscovered isoforms and must be able to represent as many reads as possible in an efficient way. In this sense, TraRECo provides us with a potential alternative for improving graph reliability even though the computational burden is much higher than the single k-mer in the de Bruijn graph approach.",2018,BMC Genomics
Analysis of Penalized Regression Methods in a Simple Linear Model on the High-Dimensional Data,"Shrinkage methods for linear regression were developed over the last ten years to reduce the weakness of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with respect to prediction accuracy. And, high dimensional data are quickly growing in many areas due to the development of technological advances which helps collect data with a large number of variables. In this paper, shrinkage methods were used to evaluate regression coefficients effectively for the high-dimensional multiple regression model, where there were fewer samples than predictors. Also, regularization approaches have become the methods of choice for analyzing such high dimensional data. We used three regulation methods based on penalized regression to select the appropriate model. Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net have desirable features; they can simultaneously perform the regulation and selection of appropriate predictor variables and estimate their effects. Here, we compared the performance of three regular linear regression methods using cross-validation method to reach the optimal point. Prediction accuracy using the least squares error (MSE) was evaluated. Through conducting a simulation study and studying real data, we found that all three methods are capable to produce appropriate models. The Elastic Net has better prediction accuracy than the rest. However, in the simulation study, the Elastic Net outperformed other two methods and showed a less value in terms of MSE.",2019,American Journal of Theoretical and Applied Statistics

Automated reconstruction of 3D scenes from sequences of images,"Modelling of 3D objects from image sequences is a challenging problem and has been an important research topic in the areas of photogrammetry and computer vision for many years. In this paper, a system is presented which automatically extracts a textured 3D surface model from a sequence of images of a scene. The system can deal with unknown camera settings. In addition, the parameters of this camera are allowed to change during acquisition (e.g., by zooming or focusing). No prior knowledge about the scene is necessary to build the 3D models. Therefore, this system offers a high degree of flexibility. The system is based on state-of-the-art algorithms recently developed in computer vision. The 3D modelling task is decomposed into a number of successive steps. Gradually, more knowledge of the scene and the camera setup is retrieved. At this point, the obtained accuracy is not yet at the level required for most metrology applications, but the visual quality is very convincing. This system has been applied to a number of applications in archaeology. The Roman site of Sagalassos (southwest Turkey) was used as a test case to illustrate the potential of this new approach.",2000,Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing
"The effects of testosterone implants on ovarian morphology in the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum (Bloch) (Teleostei: Labridae)","The effects of exogenous testosterone pellet implants at 21 and 40 days on the ovary of Thalassoma bifasciatum, a protogynous marine fish, are described. The characteristic markings of the terminal blue phase appeared by 4 to 5 days and were complete by 18 days. There was no shift in sex ratio in the treated fish when compared to an untreated control group. None of the ovaries showed signs of precocious transformation, i.e., spermatogenic tissue was lacking, and there was no evidence of duct formation. Instead, however, the ovaries of the treated fish showed marked degenerative changes characterized by oocyte breakdown, fat infiltration, vacuolization, the accumulation of fibrous PAS+ material and the appearance of small eosinophilic cells. 
 
 
 
These findings conflict with earlier studies on the same organism that employed different procedures. However, they resemble more closely the results obtained from work on another protogynoid, the ricefield eel, Monopterus albus. They add new light on the role of sex hormones in the reversal process of T. bifasciatum and hermaphroditic fishes in general.",1988,Journal of Fish Biology

SigLASSO: a LASSO approach jointly optimizing sampling likelihood and cancer mutation signatures,"Multiple mutational processes drive carcinogenesis, leaving characteristic signatures on tumor genomes. Determining the active signatures from the full repertoire of potential ones can help elucidate the mechanisms underlying cancer initiation and development. This involves decomposing the frequency of cancer mutations categorized according to their trinucleotide context into a linear combination of known mutational signatures. We formulate this task as an optimization problem with L1 regularization and develop a software tool, sigLASSO, to carry it out efficiently. First, by explicitly adding multinomial sampling into the overall objective function, we jointly optimize the likelihood of sampling and signature fitting. This is especially important when mutation counts are low and sampling variance, high, such as the case in whole exome sequencing. sigLASSO uses L1 regularization to parsimoniously assign signatures to mutation profiles, leading to sparse and more biologically interpretable solutions. Additionally, instead of hard thresholding and choosing a priori, a discrete subset of active signatures, sigLASSO fine-tunes model complexity parameters, informed by the scale of the data and prior knowledge. Finally, it is challenging to evaluate sigLASSO signature assignments. To do this, we construct a set of criteria, which we can apply consistently across assignments.",2018,bioRxiv
Data-driven Optimal Transport Cost Selection for Distributionally Robust Optimization,"Some recent works showed that several machine learning algorithms, such as square-root Lasso, Support Vector Machines, and regularized logistic regression, among many others, can be represented exactly as distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems. The distributional uncertainty set is defined as a neighborhood centered at the empirical distribution, and the neighborhood is measured by optimal transport distance. In this paper, we propose a methodology which learns such neighborhood in a natural data-driven way. We show rigorously that our framework encompasses adaptive regularization as a particular case. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that our proposed methodology is able to improve upon a wide range of popular machine learning estimators.",2019,
"Estratigrafia e correlaÃ§Ãµes da Bacia de Pouso Alegre, transiÃ§Ã£o NeoproterozÃ³ico-Cambriano, Minas Gerais, Brasil","Remnants of Pouso Alegre and other essentially terrigenous basin deposits occur along the Ribeira Belt from Minas Gerais to Parana State. Analysis of sedimentary facies and depositional systems allowed discrimination of three stratigraphic units represented by deposits related to subaerial alluvial fans, fan-delta and proximal shelf. ln subaqueous environments these deposits were reworked by tidal currents and by normal or, eventually, storm waves. The acritarchs Soldadophycus bossii GAUCHER et al. 1996, Soldadophycus major GAUCHER 2000 e Symplassosphaeridium sp. were identified in the prodeltaic sediments, denoting participation of relatively oxygenated marine waters during sedimentation. Taking into account stratigraphic, paleontological and geochronological parameters, it is proposed that a correlation exists with the other basins along the Ribeira Belt, as well with others in Africa and South America. A palaeotectonic and palaeogeographic model was adapted to the evolution of the Westem Gondwana during the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian transition, in a scenario where cratonic blocks, tectonic collage and opening and closing of the oceans interacted. After the Varanger glacial event (ca 600 Ma) and the rising of the planet temperatures, ocean levels were also rising. Brazilides Ocean waters penetrated the southem subsiding areas af the Ribeira Belt and became a base leveI for infillings of strike-slip basins in the occidental areas of the Mantiqueira Orogen. Concomitant to these epicontinental basin infillings, sedimentation was also taking place in passive basins ofthe cratonic marginal areas. The connection between the Brazilides and Adamastor oceans allowed dispersion of similar microfossils, mainly Cloudina, in almost all basins. Convergence of cratonic blocks and closure ofthe oceans near 530 Ma allowed basin inversions, as revealed by isotopic signatures ofbasement and basin rocks.",2001,
Ultrahigh Dimensional Variable Selection for Interpolation of Point Referenced Spatial Data: A Digital Soil Mapping Case Study,"Modern soil mapping is characterised by the need to interpolate point referenced (geostatistical) observations and the availability of large numbers of environmental characteristics for consideration as covariates to aid this interpolation. Modelling tasks of this nature also occur in other fields such as biogeography and environmental science. This analysis employs the Least Angle Regression (LAR) algorithm for fitting Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized Multiple Linear Regressions models. This analysis demonstrates the efficiency of the LAR algorithm at selecting covariates to aid the interpolation of geostatistical soil carbon observations. Where an exhaustive search of the models that could be constructed from 800 potential covariate terms and 60 observations would be prohibitively demanding, LASSO variable selection is accomplished with trivial computational investment.",2016,PLoS ONE
Pulmonary vein isolation by high-intensity focused ultrasound: first-in-man study with a steerable balloon catheter.,"BACKGROUND
High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) applied via a steerable balloon catheter (ProRhythm, Ronkonkoma, NY) is a novel technology for pulmonary vein (PV) isolation.


OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to assess the short-term and long-term success rates of PV isolation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) using the steerable HIFU balloon catheter.


METHODS
A total of 15 patients (7 female), mean age 59 +/- 8 years, with a long (8 +/- 5 years) history of drug-refractory, symptomatic paroxysmal AF were enrolled. After double transseptal puncture, a lasso catheter and the 16F HIFU balloon catheter (11F shaft) were inserted into the left atrium (LA). After PV angiography, phrenic nerve (PN) pacing (10 V, 2.9 ms) was conducted. In case of PN capture at the right superior PV ostium, patients were excluded (n = 3). To achieve complete PV isolation, HIFU was repeatedly applied with an acoustic power of 45 W for 40 to 90 seconds. Follow-up included telephonic interviews, transtelephonic Holter electrocardiogram, and office visits after 1, 3, and 6 months.


RESULTS
Complete electrical PV isolation was achieved in 41 of 46 (89%) PVs. Median follow-up time was 387 days (range 120 to 424 days). Seven of 12 (58%) patients were free of AF without antiarrhythmic drugs. In 2 patients, only a single AF episode was documented, resulting in an overall chronic success of 75%. Despite negative PN pacing, 2 patients experienced right-sided PN palsy, which had not resolved after 12 months.


CONCLUSION
In patients with paroxysmal AF, acute PV isolation can be achieved in 89% using a steerable HIFU balloon; 58% of all patients were free of AF and 75% reached the primary end point defined as a reduction of AF episodes to less than 50%. However, further studies need to improve identification of patients at risk for PN palsy.",2007,Heart rhythm
Preconditioning to comply with the Irrepresentable Condition,"Preconditioning is a technique from numerical linear algebra that can accelerate algorithms to solve systems of equations. In this paper, we demonstrate how preconditioning can circumvent a stringent assumption for sign consistency in sparse linear regression. Given $X \in R^{n \times p}$ and $Y \in R^n$ that satisfy the standard regression equation, this paper demonstrates that even if the design matrix $X$ does not satisfy the irrepresentable condition for the Lasso, the design matrix $F X$ often does, where $F \in R^{n\times n}$ is a preconditioning matrix defined in this paper. By computing the Lasso on $(F X, F Y)$, instead of on $(X, Y)$, the necessary assumptions on $X$ become much less stringent. 
Our preconditioner $F$ ensures that the singular values of the design matrix are either zero or one. When $n\ge p$, the columns of $F X$ are orthogonal and the preconditioner always circumvents the stringent assumptions. When $p\ge n$, $F$ projects the design matrix onto the Stiefel manifold; the rows of $F X$ are orthogonal. We give both theoretical results and simulation results to show that, in the high dimensional case, the preconditioner helps to circumvent the stringent assumptions, improving the statistical performance of a broad class of model selection techniques in linear regression. Simulation results are particularly promising.",2012,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Pierced Lasso Bundles Are a New Class of Knot-like Motifs,"A four-helix bundle is a well-characterized motif often used as a target for designed pharmaceutical therapeutics and nutritional supplements. Recently, we discovered a new structural complexity within this motif created by a disulphide bridge in the long-chain helical bundle cytokine leptin. When oxidized, leptin contains a disulphide bridge creating a covalent-loop through which part of the polypeptide chain is threaded (as seen in knotted proteins). We explored whether other proteins contain a similar intriguing knot-like structure as in leptin and discovered 11 structurally homologous proteins in the PDB. We call this new helical family class the Pierced Lasso Bundle (PLB) and the knot-like threaded structural motif a Pierced Lasso (PL). In the current study, we use structure-based simulation to investigate the threading/folding mechanisms for all the PLBs along with three unthreaded homologs as the covalent loop (or lasso) in leptin is important in folding dynamics and activity. We find that the presence of a small covalent loop leads to a mechanism where structural elements slipknot to thread through the covalent loop. Larger loops use a piercing mechanism where the free terminal plugs through the covalent loop. Remarkably, the position of the loop as well as its size influences the native state dynamics, which can impact receptor binding and biological activity. This previously unrecognized complexity of knot-like proteins within the helical bundle family comprises a completely new class within the knot family, and the hidden complexity we unraveled in the PLBs is expected to be found in other protein structures outside the four-helix bundles. The insights gained here provide critical new elements for future investigation of this emerging class of proteins, where function and the energetic landscape can be controlled by hidden topology, and should be take into account in ab initio predictions of newly identified protein targets.",2014,PLoS Computational Biology
"Long term picoplankton dynamics in a warm-monomictic, tropical high altitude lake","Long term analyses of the microbial loop, centred on the picoplankton dynamics, were carried out over a five-year (1998 to 2002) period in Lake Alchichica (Puebla, Mexico), a high altitude tropical athalassohaline lake. The hydrodynamics of the lake followed a warm-monomictic pattern with mixing at a minimum temperature during the early dry season while the stratification was pronounced in the late dry season and throughout the rainy season; anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion lasted <9 months. The annual mean concentrations of chlorophyll-a were below 4 Î¼g L-1 in 1998, 1999 and 2001, however, 6.1 and 5.2 Î¼g L-1 in 2000 and 2002, respectively. Total picoplankton, TPP, displayed a temporal pattern that followed the mixing-stratification cycle. The highest TPP values (the whole water column â‰¥5Ã—106 cells mL-1) were found during mixing and early stratification (January-March). The minimum numbers were present during late stratification (October-November). The maximum TPP numbers were observed within the layer 0-20 m, which corresponded to the epilimnion during the stratification period. Neither the thermocline nor the deep chlorophyll maximum showed an elevated TPP concentration. In the hypolimnion, TPP numbers were low (frequently <1Ã—106 cells mL-1) apparently as a result of the long period of anoxia. Notwithstanding autotrophic picoplankton (APP) contributed even â‰¥30% of TPP (2001 to 2002); no significant correlation was found between TPP and chlorophyll-a.",2009,Journal of Limnology
Gamma Response Regression with Percentile Lasso and Ridge to Estimate Extreme Rainfall,"An extreme rainfall can cause flood or drought and so it is necessary to develop a prediction model to anticipate the impact of extreme rainfall phenomenon. The statistical downscaling is one of the existing methods to analyze the rainfall data based on Global Circulation Model (GCM) output. The rainfall data can be Gamma distribution because the data can be zero or more than zero. The extreme rainfall data could be in the tail of Gamma distribution and so General Linier Model (GLM) with Gamma response variable.The GCM output is usually high dimensional data and multicollinearity. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) and ridge penalty included in a model can overcome such problems. The value of optimum penalty can be estimated using cross validation. However, the method is very sensitive tothe k-fold size and the results are unstable. This weakness is overcome by repeating cross validation and finding some percentiles. This paper discusses a regression model with the response of Gamma distribution to predict extreme rainfall based on the25th,50th,75th,90th,and95thpercentiles. The result shows that,based on the value of root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), the model with lasso (RMSEP=48.42 mm/month) on percentile 75th is better than that with ridge (RMSEP=50.44 mm/month) on percentile 25th.",2016,
415 The association between world development indicators per country and gender ratio in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a big data approach analysis,"Background and aims Systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) are characterised by a wide spectrum of demographic patterns with respect to the ethnic differences, age at diagnosis and especially gender distribution. Studying the distribution of these diseases across geographic regions using a big data-driven approach may help obtain a more â€œhigh-definition resolutionâ€ of these complex diseases. Methods We explored the potential of the Google search engine to collect and merge 133 SLE cohorts (>100 patients) reported in the Pubmed library. The country indicators are subclassified into 20 specific topics.Statistically-significant correlations were further corrected according to the Lasso statistical model (LC). Results We found statistical correlations in the following areas: Education, Environment, Infrastructure, Economy and Growth, Health, Private sector, Public sector and Social Protection and Labour. A higher F:M ratio was found in countries who had a higher frequency of women in tertiary education/academic staff ,female legislators, higher% of CO2 emissions from electricity/heat, higher% of terrestrial and marine protected areas and of taxes. In contrast, a lower F:M ratio was found in countries who had a higher frequency of women in unemployment and countries with a higher out-of-pocket health expenditure for private healthcare Conclusions There is a clear trend of association between the percentage of women diagnosed with SLE and some indicators of development of each country. The gap between women and men diagnosed with SLE is wider in countries with the highest frequencies of women working and women with high study degrees, and those countries with more taxes and a higher percentage of protected geographical areas.",2017,Lupus science & medicine

Original article The LocaLisa system as the key to shortening the procedure duration and fluoroscopy time during ablation of atrial fibrillation,"Background: Ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) can be difficult and time-consuming. Systems facilitating catheter navigation may be helpful. Aim: To compare the efficacy of the LocaLisa system with the conventional mapping/ablation approach to radiofrequency (RF) ablation of AF. Methods: Group 1, consisting of 64 patients (48 male; aged 51.5Â±10.6 years), underwent segmental isolation of the pulmonary veins with the Lasso catheter and the LocaLisa system. Group 2, consisting of 64 patients (44 male, aged 51.4Â±11.0 years), had RF ablation guided by means of a conventional fluoroscopy-based approach. Clinical and procedural data were analysed. Results: Nine patients from group 1 and three patients from group 2 had persistent AF. In group 1 the mean number of isolated veins was 3.98Â±0.96, while in group 2 â€“ 4.0Â±0.95 (NS). In group 1 cavotricuspid isthmus lines were created in four patients and lines in the roof of the left atrium in two patients. One patient needed slow pathway ablation. In group 2 six patients had ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus and a line was created at the roof of the left atrium in one patient. Two patients had ectopic activity ablated in the crista terminalis. Procedure times were 131.6Â±40.3 and 170.0Â±56.5 min (p Conclusions: The LocaLisa navigation system makes it possible to shorten both the duration of the procedure and the total fluoroscopy time during ablation of AF.",2008,Kardiologia Polska
Inferring metabolite interactomes via molecular structure informed Bayesian graphical model selection with an application to coronary artery disease,"Introduction While the generation of reference genomes facilitates the elucidation of gene-phenome associations, reference models of the metabolome that are specific to organism, sample type (e.g. plasma, serum, urine, cell-culture), and state (including disease), remain uncommon. In studying heart disease in humans, a reference model describing the relationships between metabolites in plasma has not been determined but would have great utility as a reference for comparing acute disease states such as myocardial infarction. Materials and Methods We present a methodology for deriving probabilistic models that describe the partial correlation structure of metabolite distributions (â€œinteractomesâ€) from metabolomics data. As determining partial correlation structures requires estimating p*(p-1)/2 parameters for p metabolites, the dimension of the search space for parameter values is immense. Consequently, we have developed a Bayesian methodology for the penalized estimation of model parameters in which the magnitude of penalization is drawn from probability distributions with hyperparameters linked to molecular structure similarity. In our work, structural similarity was determined as the Tanimoto coefficient of algorithmically-generated â€œatom colorsâ€ that capture the local structure around each atom within each structure. A Gibbs sampler (a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique) was implemented for simulating the posterior distribution of model parameters. We have made software for implementing this methodology publicly available via the R package BayesianGLasso. Results / Conclusions First, we demonstrate robust performance of our methodology (sensitivity, specificity, and measures of accuracy) for recovering the true underlying partial correlation structure over simulated datasets (with simulated metabolite abundances and simulated known structural similarity). We then present an interactome model for stable heart disease inferred from non-targeted mass spectrometry data via this methodology. Inspection of the local graph topology about cholate reveals probabilistic interactions with other primary bile acids, secondary bile acids, and many steroid hormones sharing the same precursors.",2018,bioRxiv
Fine mapping and subphenotyping implicates ADRA1B gene variants in psoriasis susceptibility in a Chinese population.,"AIM
A genomic region on 5q33.3 lies between and encompasses the IL12B and PTTG1 genes, and contains many potential psoriasis causal variants. We aimed to further examine the influence of variants in and around this region.


MATERIALS & METHODS
We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-based regression analysis to assess independent contributions of 2171 variants to psoriasis susceptibility and tested them for association with different clinical psoriasis subtypes.


RESULTS
We found that ADRA1B gene variants contribute to psoriasis in Chinese population. ADRA1B gene variants have a stronger association with moderate-to-severe disease group and an earlier age at onset of psoriasis than IL-12B and PTTG1 variants.


CONCLUSION
The association of variants in the ADRA1B gene with psoriasis could explain why variants in the IL-12B, ADRA1B and PTTG1 gene regions are associated with psoriasis.",2019,Epigenomics

Development and validation of a simple-to-use nomogram for predicting refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children.,"OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to develop and validate a simple-to-use nomogram for predicting refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (RMPP) in children.


METHODS
A total of 73 children with RMPP and 146 children with general Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia were included. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were obtained. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to determine optimal predictors. The nomogram was plotted by multivariable logistic regression. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility.


RESULTS
The LASSO regression analysis identified lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, neutrophil ratio, and high fever as significant predictors of RMPP. This nomogram-illustrated model showed good discrimination, calibration, and clinical value. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the nomogram was 0.884 (95% CI, 0.823-0.945) in the training set and 0.881 (95% CI, 0.807-0.955) in the validating set. Calibration curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed good consistency between the predictions of the nomogram and the actual observations, and decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram was clinically useful.


CONCLUSION
A simple-to-use nomogram for predicting RMPP in early stage was developed and validated. This may help physicians recognize RMPP earlier.",2020,Pediatric pulmonology
Adaptive multinomial regression with overlapping groups for multi-class classification of lung cancer,"Multi-class classification has attracted much attention in cancer diagnosis and treatment and many machine learning methods have emerged for addressing this issue recently. However, class imbalance and gene selection problems occur in classifying lung cancer data. In this paper, an adaptive multinomial regression with a sparse overlapping group lasso penalty is proposed to perform classification and grouped gene selection for lung cancer gene expression data. An overlapped grouping strategy with biological interpretability is proposed, which highlights the importance of gene groups from the minority classes. By using the conditional mutual information, the gene significance within each group is evaluated and the data-driven weights are constructed. Based on the grouping strategy and constructed weights, a regularized adaptive multinomial regression is presented and the solving algorithm is developed, which can not only select the important gene groups for each class in performing multi-class classification, but also adaptively select important genes within each group. The experiment results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the other 6 methods on classification accuracy, and the selected genes are disease-causing genes for lung cancer.",2018,Computers in biology and medicine
"The nematode assemblage of a coastal lagoon (Lake Varano, southern Italy): ecology and biodiversity patterns","This study was conducted in Lake Varano (southern Italy) in order to determine the environmental parameters that influence nematode taxonomic and functional diversity and how they influence them, and to classify for the first time the ecological quality status of a transitional environment. The general composition and level of taxonomic diversity were comparable with those reported for transitional environments worldwide. Principal component analysis revealed that the main environmental factors controlling the assemblages in terms of both composition and biological traits were grain size, organic matter, pollution load index and, only secondarily, salinity. Molgolaimus allgeni, Terschellingia longicaudata and Leptolaimus luridus showed higher values in relation to silt, organic matter and pollution load index, while Axonolaimus caudostriatus, Odontophora wieseri, Paramonhystera pellucida and Paracanthonchus longicaudatus showed higher values in relation to the redox potential and sand percentage. Salinity was detected as an influencing parameter only secondarily and particularly for Calomicrolaimus honestus, Daptonema normandicum, Thalassomonhystera parva and Sabatieria pulchra . With respect to functional traits, the trophic groups seemed to be mainly related to sediment type, which is in turn reflected by the nature of the available food. The maturity index, as well as c-p classes, did not always permit a clear interpretation of the interaction between anthropogenic and natural factors. However, the greater influence of the San Antonino and San Francesco Canals was perfectly revealed by the nematode assemblage. In accordance with the current ecological quality classes, Lake Varano can mainly be classified as having good to poor ecological quality status.",2014,Scientia Marina
Partial least squares method based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator,"In many multivariate statistical techniques, a set of linear functions of the original variables is produced. But this kind of model derived is difficult to interpret, Such as principle component regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR), they cannot select variables. The approach least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) can easily produce sparse solutions and select variables during estimate parameters. This article proposes a new technique for interpretation based on these properties, it's a combination of partial least squares (PLS) and LASSO and can easily interpret regression models. This method will be more favorable for large number of variables compared to PLS.",2010,2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering(ICACTE)
"Winogradskyella psychrotolerans sp. nov., a marine bacterium of the family Flavobacteriaceae isolated from Arctic sediment.","A novel Gram-negative, rod-coccus shaped, non-motile, strain, RS-3(T), was isolated from a sediment sample collected from the marine transect of Kongsfjorden, Ny-Ã…lesund, Svalbard, Arctic. Colonies and broth cultures were yellowish in colour due to the presence of carotenoids. Strain RS-3(T) was positive for oxidase, aesculinase, caseinase, gelatinase and urease activities and negative for amylase, catalase, lipase, lysine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, DNase and Î²-galactosidase activities. The predominant fatty acids were iso-C15â€Š:â€Š0 (18.0), anteiso-C15â€Š:â€Š0 (16.8), iso-C15â€Š:â€Š1 G (14.2), anteiso-C15â€Š:â€Š1 A (6.0) and iso-C15â€Š:â€Š0 3-OH (6.8). Strain RS-3(T) contained MK-6 (72.42â€Š%) and MK-7 (27.58â€Š%) as the major respiratory quinones and phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified aminolipids and two unidentified lipids make up the polar lipid composition. The DNA G+C content of strain RS-3(T) was 34.7Â±1.2 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that Winogradskyella pacifica and Winogradskyella thalassocola are the most closely related species with sequence similarities to the type strains of these species of 98.5 and 97.7â€Š%, respectively. However, DNA-DNA hybridization with Winogradskyella pacifica KCTC 22997(T) and Winogradskyella thalassocola DSM 15363(T) showed a relatedness of 22 and 42.5â€Š% with respect to strain RS-3(T). Based on the DNA-DNA hybridization values, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics and phylogenetic inference, strain RS-3(T) is proposed as a novel species of the genus Winogradskyella, for which the name Winogradskyella psychrotolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Winogradskyella psychrotolerans sp. nov. is RS-3(T) (â€Š=â€ŠCIP 110154(T)â€Š=â€ŠNBRC 106169(T)).

Enhancing Teaching and Learning TEL 0009,"Engineering is sometimes called the ""Swiss army knife"" of degrees because graduates are employed in so many sectors, and demand for Ontario's engineering programs is increasing at an annual rate of 6 â€“ 9%. Similarly, engineering technology college diplomas are experiencing significant growth, leading to an ever-higher demand for improved pathways between institutions. Engineering now represents the fourth largest group of college-university transfers in the Province. Transfer routes directly from colleges into accredited engineering programs is challenging, but this presentation will introduce a collaborative project between the Lassonde School of Engineering and Seneca College to develop innovative BScTech programs characterized by: â€” Multiple entry and exit points; â€” Transparent and seamless pathways that optimize student success; â€” Well-defined sets of learning outcomes; â€” Diploma, undergraduate and graduate level courses recognized by both institutions and used as building blocks within multiple programs in both institutions; â€” A required experiential learning component.",2014,
Method of integrated resort treatment of patients with degree i-ii obesity,"FIELD: medicine. SUBSTANCE: invention refers to medicine, namely to therapy, balneotherapy. The method involves prescribing keeping diet No.8, taking radon baths. Individual patient's sensitivity to radon procedures shall be determined at first. That is ensured by measuring blood pressure and pulse rate on an empty stomach before taking a bath. Then the patient takes a bath with mineral water of thermal radon sources at water temperature approximately 38Â°C and has a rest for 30 minutes. Then blood pressure and pulse rate are measured once more. If observing pulse being unchanged or changed by Â±10 beat/min and systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure being changed by Â±10 mm Hg, the type I reaction is stated in the patient. If pulse is found to be changed by Â±20 beat/min, and systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure has been changed by Â±15 mm Hg, the type II reaction is observed. If pulse has been changed by Â±30 beat/min, and systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure has been changed by Â±20 mm Hg, the type III reaction is observed. The type I reaction requires the following bath-taking scheme: the first procedure - 5 minutes, the second one - 8 minutes, the third one - 10 minutes, all the following procedures - for 15 minutes. The type II reaction requires the following bath-taking scheme: the first procedure - 5 minutes, the second one - 8 minutes, the third one - 10 minutes, all the following procedures - for 12 minutes. The type III reaction requires the following bath-taking scheme: the first procedure - 5 minutes, the second one - 8 minutes, the third one - 10 minutes, all the following procedures - for 10 minutes. Radon bath is taken for two days running followed by the two-day pause. Before noon, two hours after breakfast, the patient moderately drinks radon water 200 ml, swims in the swimming pool for 40 minutes and undergoes a detensor-therapy. During afternoon, two hours after dinner, the patient moderately drinks radon water 200 ml and takes a bath with radon water; then a resonant-acoustic fluctuations procedure follows. The therapeutic course includes 10-15 baths. On the bath-free days, intestinal lavage is prescribed before noon, and hydromassage and body and face thalassotherapy are used during afternoon. EFFECT: method provides manifested body weight reduction ensured by normalising action of external respiratory function and lipid metabolism. 3 cl, 1 tbl",2011,
Reactivity of acid gas pollutants with Ca(OH)2 at low temperature in the presence of water vapour,"The reactivity of Ca-based sorbents with acid gases (specifically SO2, HCl and NO2) at low temperature has been a subject of interest in the last decades, since it constitutes the fundamental reactive system in a number of technologies aimed at the reduction of acid gas emission from industrial combustors or incinerator plants. However, a complete understanding of the chemistry involved still presents unsolved challenges. This thesis has been devoted to provide new insight on the kinetic modeling and reaction mechanism of the system Ca(OH)2-SO2 (+NO2) and direct evidence of the role of water on them. The mechanistic pathways of the Ca(OH)2-NO2 (+SO2) and Ca(OH)2-HCl systems are also discussed.
The experimental breakthrough curves of SO2 obtained from a Ca(OH)2 bed reactor are successfully simulated by a semi-empirical kinetic model (DM-ISCM). This model takes into account (1) the deactivation of the reagent surface as the reaction product deposits on the surface and (2) an outward solid-state diffusion of hydrated Ca2+ and HO- ions from the inner Ca(OH)2/CaSO3(1/2)H2O interface to the outer CaSO3(1/2)H2O/gas one.
The examination of Ca(OH)2 single crystals reacted with SO2 by atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveals that the reaction product crystallizes forming needle-like features irrespective of the RH at which reaction takes place. Furthermore, the AFM explorations provide evidence of product crystal (CaSO3(1/2)H2O) mobility on the surface of the reactant crystal and further product crystal aggregation, as long as the crystal is in contact with water vapor. This finding suggests that once a product crystal is formed during the reaction, it is removed from its position, and consequently, new surface of Ca(OH)2 is opened up for further reaction.
A reaction mechanism that might be consistent with the DM-ISCM and AFM results would consist of the following steps: (1) formation of an adsorbed water layer on the reagent surface; (2) hydration of SO2 with adsorbed water molecules to form SO2zH2O complexes; (3) reaction of the complexes with Ca(OH)2 to form the reaction product CaSO3(1/2)H2O by a solid-state mechanism; (4) diffusion of product crystallites and rearrangement of the reacted surface to form needle-like features; (5) ionic solid-state diffusion or reaction with residual active surface. Although in all the steps the adsorbed water could play a role, the most relevant one that might account for the outstanding effect of the RH on the reactivity of the system could be step (4). It could be proposed that product crystallites diffusion is promoted by the formation of H-bonds.
On the other hand, the mechanistic pathway proposed for the system Ca(OH)2-NO2 is based on redefining the reactions that take place in aqueous solution, but considering their solid state character. It consists of two consecutive reactions: (1) NO2 reacts with Ca(OH)2 to give Ca(NO3)2 and Ca(NO2)2; (2) the product Ca(NO2)2 further reacts with adsorbed water to form NO and Ca(NO3)2. Furthermore, when SO2 is also present in the gas phase, a redox reaction between CaSO3 and NO2 could also occur. These reactions are consistent with the results from solid analyses and they seem to be promoted by adsorbed water. Moreover, the formation of Ca(NO3)2 and Ca(NO2)2 hygroscopic salts might account for the strong enhancement of the ability of Ca(OH)2 to capture SO2 under the presence of NO2. The SO2 experimental breakthrough curves obtained in these conditions are also reasonably well described by the DM-ISCM.
Regarding the Ca(OH)2-HCl system, a possible mechanistic pathway consistent with our experimental results and the those seemingly diverse from literature concerns two consecutive reactions: (1) formation of Ca(OH)Cl, and (2) final formation of CaCl2 from the reaction between Ca(OH)Cl and HCl. A kinetic control of these reactions might be suggested, that is, depending on the experimental conditions, the second reaction does not take place. This second reaction is only expected to be promoted at high HCl concentrations and temperatures and/or at high reaction times.
"" RESUM EN CATALA:
En les ultimes decades, la continua i creixent demanda de qualitat de vida, juntament amb un progressiu i sostingut increment de la poblacio mundial, ha generat un fort creixement de lactivitat industrial i del transport. Aquesta situacio ha originat una emissio massiva de contaminants a latmosfera, alterant-ne la seva composicio i causant aixi efectes nocius en el medi ambient i en la salut humana. Tradicionalment, tant la legislacio nord-americana com leuropea shan centrat en la contaminacio causada per la pluja acida i per lanomenat smog fotoquimic. La pluja acida pot originar-se a partir de lemissio directa de gasos acids forts, com el HCl, pero la major part es produida indirectament per lemissio daltres gasos com el SO2 i el NO2 El SO2 i el HCl atmosferics soriginen basicament a partir de la combustio de materials solids que contenen sofre o clor, respectivament. En aquest sentit, la principal font demissio del SO2 son les centrals termiques de combustio de carbo el petroli tambe pot contenir sofre-, pero tambe sen pot generar a partir daltres processos com el refinat del petroli i les plantes incineradores.
Una de les alternatives mes utilitzades per a reduir les emissions de gasos acids generats en fonts estacionaries son les tecnologies de control post-combustio, que consisteixen en laddicio de solids alcalins en el corrent gasos per a neutralitzar els seus components gasosos acids. Aquest proces genera productes solids amb un potencial contaminant molt menor que lassociada als seus precursors gasosos.
En moltes daquestes tecnologies safegeix aigua de diferents formes en el proces, ja que la reaccio de neutralitzacio dels gasos acids safavoreix en la seva presencia. Depenent de la quantitat daigua i forma que sintrodueixi en el proces i del punt dinsercio del solid adsorbent en les centrals termiques, les tecnologies es poden classificar en metodes humits i metodes secs, que al mateix temps es poden que es poden dividir en tres grups: injeccio al forn, Spray dry scrubbing i injeccio dadsorbent sec .
En els darrers anys sha dut a terme una recerca intensiva a escala de laboratori i de planta pilot per a la determinacio de lefecte de les diferents variables de proces en els processos in-duct -temperatura, humitat relativa, area superficial del solid adsorbent i relacio calci/sofre- sobre la capacitat dels solids per a retenir SO2. En canvi, shan publicat pocs estudis centrats en la cinetica i mecanismes de reaccio que intervenen en aquests processos. La manca destudis de les reaccions implicades es mes acusada en aquelles parts dels processos on laigua interve en forma vapor, com es en els collectors de particules de les centrals termiques normalment filtres de manigues- i en els conductes on les temperatures son suficientment elevades per a que laigua es trobi en forma vapor.

"Occurrence of natural Anopheles arabiensis swarms in an urban area of Bobo-Dioulasso City, Burkina Faso, West Africa.","The swarming behaviour of natural populations of Anopheles arabiensis was investigated by conducting transect surveys on 10 consecutive days, around dusk, from March to April and from September to October 2012 in Dioulassoba, a district of Bobo-Dioulasso city in Burkina Faso (West Africa). Swarms were observed outside, around identified larval breeding sites on the banks of the Houet River, as well as in the open-air courtyards found at the centre of many homes in the region. Swarms were found to occur in open sunlit spaces, mostly located above physical or visual cues somehow visually distinct from the surrounding area. Overall 67 and 78 swarms were observed, respectively, during the dry season (March-April) and the rainy season (September-October) of 2012, between 1.5m and 4.5m above the ground at their centre. 964 mosquitoes were collected and analysed from dry season swarms, of which most were male, and all were An. arabiensis, as were the few resting mosquitoes collected indoors. Larvae collected from breeding sites found on the banks of the Houet River mostly consisted of An. arabiensis and only a minority of Anopheles coluzzii (formerly identified as An. gambiae M form). Of 1694 mosquitoes analysed from 78 swarms in the rainy season collections, a few An. gambiae (formerly known as An. gambiae S form) males were identified, and the remainders were An. arabiensis. The majority of larvae collected during the wet season from the same breeding sites were identified as An. arabiensis followed by An. coluzzii and An. gambiae. The same pattern of species composition was observed in resting mosquitoes, though the proportion of An. arabiensis was less overwhelming. These data support the conclusion that An. arabiensis is the most prevalent species in this area, though the difference in species composition when using different population sampling techniques is noteworthy. Further studies are required for more detailed investigations of male dispersal, feeding behaviour and mating patterns in this urban setting.",2014,Acta tropica
A hybrid regression technique for house prices prediction,"Usually, House price index represents the summarized price changes of residential housing. While for a single family house price prediction, it needs more accurate method based on location, house type, size, build year, local amenities, and some other factors which could affect house demand and supply. With limited dataset and data features, a practical and composite data pre-processing, creative feature engineering method is examined in this paper. The paper also proposes a hybrid Lasso and Gradient boosting regression model to predict individual house price. The proposed approach has recently been deployed as the key kernel for Kaggle Challenge â€œHouse Prices: Advanced Regression Techniquesâ€.

Does Patronage Still Drive Politics for the Rural Poor in the Developing World? A Comparative Perspective from the Livestock Sector,"Is the analysis of patronâ€client networks still important to the understanding of developing country politics or has it now been overtaken by a focus on â€˜social capitalâ€™? Drawing on seventeen country studies of the political environment for livestock policy in poor countries, this article concludes that although the nature of patronage has changed significantly, it remains highly relevant to the ways peasant interests are treated. Peasant populations were found either to have no clear connection to their political leaders or to be controlled by political clientage. Furthermore, communities â€˜freeâ€™ of patronâ€ clienttiestothecentregenerallyarenotbetterrepresentedbypoliticalassociations but instead receive fewer benefits from the state. Nonetheless, patterns ofclientagearedifferentfromwhattheywerefortyyearsago.First,patronage chains today often have a global reach, through trade, bilateral donor governmentsandinternationalNGOs.Second,theresourcesthatfuelpoliticalclientage today are less monopolistic and less adequate to the task of purchasing peasant political loyalty. Thus the bonds of patronage are less tight than they were historically. Third, it follows from the preceding point and the greater diversity of patrons operating today that elite conflicts are much more likely to create spaces in which peasant interests can eventually be aggregated into autonomous associations with independent political significance in the national polity. NGOs are playing an important role in opening up this political space although at the moment, they most often act like a new type of patron.",2010,Development and Change

METAGENOMIC BARCODING OF MICROBIOMES FROM SEAGRASS FOUND IN COASTAL KENYA USING 16S rRNA SEQUENCING,"Sea grasses are unique flowering plants that live entirely in the marine environment. They form large meadows that provide habitats for marine life and physical anchoring systems. Microbes have been found to have a significant effect on many eukaryotic organismsâ€™ health and has been proposed to be used as an indicator which can guide its sustainable exploitation. For economic exploitation of this resource, such as by establishing a healthy sea grass stand that can be harvested for human snack, livestock feed or fertilizer, its sustainability needs to assessed. This study proposed to characterize the abundance and diversity of microbiomes associated with Thalassodendron ciliatum, and Enhalus acoroides; leaves and roots and their surrounding water and sediment. Environmental DNA samples were extracted from the target microbiomes of the 2 species, using Mobio DNA extraction kits, PCR amplified using universal 16S primers, the amplicons purified and submitted to 16S sequencing. The resulting cleaned sequences were analyzed using the Quantitative Insight Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) bioinformatics pipeline. Overall, the most dominant phyla associated with both species was Proteobacteria, Bacteriodes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria Caldithrix and Acidobacteria. E. acoroides associated samples showed higher organism diversity compared to T. ciliatum associated samples, in all alpha diversity metrics. Beta diversity analyses showed that, rhizosphere samples tended to cluster closer together than phyllosphere samples, but water sample replicates did not group together at all in both sites on the PCoA plot. E. acoroides associated samples exhibited higher proportions of microbes present in primary nutrient cycles, and fewer microbes associated with pathogenicity and heavy metals than T. ciliatum associated samples. Fecal indicator bacteria were absent at both sampling sites. T. ciliatum will serve better as fertilizer than animal feed due to the relatively high proportion of suspected pathogenic bacteria genera as well as decomposer bacteria present in its microbiomes. E. acoroides, will be more feasible as human and animal feed due to the virtual absence of pathogenic bacteria genera and observed presence of large numbers of bacteria associated with primary nutrient cycles.",2017,

Weak Fault Detection for Gearboxes Using Majorization-Minimization and Asymmetric Convex Penalty Regularization,"It is a primary challenge in the fault diagnosis community of the gearbox to extract the weak fault features under heavy background noise and nonstationary conditions. For this purpose, a novel weak fault detection approach based on majorizationâ€“minimization (MM) and asymmetric convex penalty regularization (ACPR) is proposed in this paper. The proposed objective cost function (OCF) consisting of a signal-fidelity term, and two parameterized penalty terms (i.e., one is an asymmetric nonconvex penalty regularization term, and another is a symmetric nonconvex penalty regularization term).To begin with, the asymmetric and symmetric penalty functions are established on the basis of an L1-norm model, then, according to the splitting idea, the majorizer of the symmetric function and the majorizer of the asymmetric function are respectively calculated via the MM algorithm. Finally, the MM is re-introduced to solve the proposed OCF. As examples, the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method is verified through simulated data and gearbox experimental real data. Meanwhile, a comparison with the state of-the-art methods is illustrated, including nonconvex penalty regularization (NCPR) and L1-norm fused lasso optimization (LFLO) techniques, the results indicate that the gear chipping characteristic frequency 13.22 Hz and its harmonic (2f, 3f, 4f and 5f) can be identified clearly, which highlights the superiority of the proposed approach.",2018,Symmetry
A Geostatistical Framework for Heterogeneous Spatial Data Fusion,"This paper proposes a geostatistical framework of spatial data fusion for spatial prediction and uncertainty modeling, while accounting for varieties of spatial heterogeneities and complex spatial dependencies. Within this proposed framework, spatial variables are characterized via spatial covariance functions, which measure the spatial dependencies of pair-wise locations and project heterogeneous spatial data into a unified space of similarity (or kernel space). The representation of spatial covariance thus provides a convenient venue to integrate heterogeneous data source while taking into account spatial dependencies. We show that the probability distribution at target locations given the neighboring observations can be represented as a generalized linear combination of spatial covariance functions between the target and observed locations. For parameter estimation, a recently proposed group LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)) approach is adopted to prevent the model from over-fitting. Case studies are conducted to showcase the advantages of the proposed framework.",2014,
Non-negative Iterative Convex Refinement Approach for Accurate and Robust Reconstruction in Cerenkov Luminescence Tomography.,"Cerenkov luminescence tomography (CLT) is a promising imaging tool for obtaining three-dimensional (3D) non-invasive visualization of the in vivo distribution of radiopharmaceuticals. However, the reconstruction performance remains unsatisfactory for biomedical applications because the inverse problem of CLT is severely ill-conditioned and intractable. In this study, therefore, a novel non-negative iterative convex refinement (NNICR) approach was utilized to improve the CLT reconstruction accuracy, robustness as well as the shape recovery capability. The spike and slab prior information was employed to capture the sparsity of Cerenkov source, which could be formalized as a non-convex optimization problem. The NNICR approach solved this non-convex problem by refining the solutions of the convex sub-problems. To evaluate the performance of the NNICR approach, numerical simulations and in vivo tumor-bearing mice models experiments were conducted. Conjugated gradient based Tikhonov regularization approach (CG-Tikhonov), fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm based Lasso approach (Fista-Lasso) and Elastic-Net regularization approach were used for the comparison of the reconstruction performance. The results of these experiments demonstrated that the NNICR approach obtained superior reconstruction performance in terms of location accuracy, shape recovery capability, robustness and in vivo practicability. It was believed that this study would facilitate the preclinical and clinical applications of CLT in the future.",2020,IEEE transactions on medical imaging
Integrative Bayesian variable selection with gene-based informative priors for genome-wide association studies,"BackgroundGenome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) are typically designed to identify phenotype-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) individually using univariate analysis methods. Though providing valuable insights into genetic risks of common diseases, the genetic variants identified by GWAS generally account for only a small proportion of the total heritability for complex diseases. To solve this â€œmissing heritabilityâ€ problem, we implemented a strategy called integrative Bayesian Variable Selection (iBVS), which is based on a hierarchical model that incorporates an informative prior by considering the gene interrelationship as a network. It was applied here to both simulated and real data sets.ResultsSimulation studies indicated that the iBVS method was advantageous in its performance with highest AUC in both variable selection and outcome prediction, when compared to Stepwise and LASSO based strategies. In an analysis of a leprosy caseâ€“control study, iBVS selected 94 SNPs as predictors, while LASSO selected 100 SNPs. The Stepwise regression yielded a more parsimonious model with only 3 SNPs. The prediction results demonstrated that the iBVS method had comparable performance with that of LASSO, but better than Stepwise strategies.ConclusionsThe proposed iBVS strategy is a novel and valid method for Genome-wide Association Studies, with the additional advantage in that it produces more interpretable posterior probabilities for each variable unlike LASSO and other penalized regression methods.",2014,BMC Genetics

Online Group Feature Selection,"Online feature selection with dynamic features has become an active research area in recent years. However, in some real-world applications such as image analysis and email spam filtering, features may arrive by groups. Existing online feature selection methods evaluate features individually, while existing group feature selection methods cannot handle online processing. Motivated by this, we formulate the online group feature selection problem, and propose a novel selection approach for this problem. Our proposed approach consists of two stages: online intra-group selection and online inter-group selection. In the intra-group selection, we use spectral analysis to select discriminative features in each group when it arrives. In the inter-group selection, we use Lasso to select a globally optimal subset of features. This 2-stage procedure continues until there are no more features to come or some predefined stopping conditions are met.

We consider estimating structured VAR (vector auto-regressive model), where the structure can be captured by any suitable norm, e.g., Lasso, group Lasso, order weighted Lasso, etc. In VAR setting with correlated noise, although there is strong dependence over time and covariates, we establish bounds on the non-asymptotic estimation error of structured VAR parameters. The estimation error is of the same order as that of the corresponding Lasso-type estimator with independent samples, and the analysis holds for any norm. Our analysis relies on results in generic chaining, subexponential martingales, and spectral representation of VAR models. Experimental results on synthetic and real data with a variety of structures are presented, validating theoretical results.",2016,
Dictionary Learning-Based MR Image Reconstruction in the Presence of Speckle Noise: Greedy Versus Convex,"The trend of acquiring samples at a rate far below Nyquist rate is termed as compressive sensing (CS). CS enables the accurate recovery of signals/images by exploiting the underlying sparsity in either transform or signal domain. CS is useful in reducing acquisition time in MR imaging. In this paper, CS based on dictionary learning has been applied for MR imaging in the presence of speckle noise. Performance of two classes of sparse recovery techniques, namely convex optimization and greedy iterative algorithms, has been investigated and compared, when employed for the sparse coding stage of an adaptive patch-based dictionary. Two greedy algorithms, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP), are considered and contrasted with convex techniques: basis pursuit (BP) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Experimentation has been done on spine, knee, and brain image by varying the speckle noise variance, sparsity threshold per patch for various sampling schemes. Results show that convex techniques achieve higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) than greedy algorithms in the presence of high noise.",2019,
Randomized pick-freeze for sparse Sobol indices estimation in high dimension,"This article investigates selection of variables in high-dimension from a non-parametric regression model. In many concrete situations, we are concerned with estimating a non-parametric regression function f that may depend on a large number p of inputs variables. Unlike standard procedures, we do not assume that f belongs to a class of regular functions (Holder, Sobolev, ...), yet we assume that f is a square-integrable function with respect to a known product measure. Furthermore, observe that, in some situations, only a small number s of the coordinates actually affects f in an additive manner. In this context, we prove that, with only ð’ª(s logâ€‰p ) random evaluations of f , one can find which are the relevant input variables with overwhelming probability. Our proposed method is an unconstrained l 1 -minimization procedure based on the Sobolâ€™s method. One step of this procedure relies on support recovery using l 1 -minimization and thresholding. More precisely, we use a thresholded-LASSO to faithfully uncover the significant input variables. In this frame, we prove that one can relax the mutual incoherence property (known to require ð’ª(s 2 logâ€‰p ) observations) and still ensure faithful recovery from ð’ª(s Î± logâ€‰p ) observations for any 1 â‰¤ Î± â‰¤ 2.",2014,Esaim: Probability and Statistics
Aggregation of supports along the Lasso path,"In linear regression with fixed design, we propose two procedures that aggregate a data-driven collection of supports. The collection is a subset of the $2^p$ possible supports and both its cardinality and its elements can depend on the data. The procedures satisfy oracle inequalities with no assumption on the design matrix. Then we use these procedures to aggregate the supports that appear on the regularization path of the Lasso in order to construct an estimator that mimics the best Lasso estimator. If the restricted eigenvalue condition on the design matrix is satisfied, then this estimator achieves optimal prediction bounds. Finally, we discuss the computational cost of these procedures.",2016,
Mothers' Views of Childhood Diseases in Bobo-Dioulasso,"This paper attempts to identify local perceptions beliefs and practices that contribute to the persistence of infectious diseases in Bobo-Dioulasso a town of Burkina Faso in Sub-Saharan Africa. The research is based on data from an infant and child mortality survey of 8000 children born in 1982 and on transcripts from interviews with 76 of their mothers. Mothers commonly attributed diarrhea-related diseases to ""the qualities of the milk"" and to particularities of sexual behavior. There was no understanding of the infectious nature of diarrheas. The non-use of latrines by children and the disposition of feces in Bobo-Dioulasso contributes to the prevalence of infection. Public health would benefit from a better popular understanding of the transmission of disease. None of the women in the qualitative survey mentioned oral rehydration therapy (ORT) as a treatment of diarrhea although primary health care in Burkina Faso uses ORT as a priority strategy. The advantages of educating women in the relation between breastfeeding supplementation abstinence and disease go beyond the reduction of gastro-intestinal ailments. The belief that one should wean a child when sexual relations resume may among some populations remove some of the contraceptive effect of prolonged breastfeeding and hasten the next birth. It is clear that traditional medicine competes with modern medicine in the treatment of diseases in Bobo-Dioulasso. Such competition leads to the low use of the modern health facilities and contributes to the persisting high childhood morbidity and mortality. It is naive to assume that imported innovations like modern medicine will be automatically adopted. In spite of the fact that it is free immunization is not used by many people for their children. Policy makers should make extra efforts to reach and involve the local population in the development of new programs.",1987,

Weighted composite quantile regression for single-index models,"In this paper we propose a weighted composite quantile regression (WCQR) estimation for single-index models. For parametric part, the WCQR is augmented using a data-driven weighting scheme. With the error distribution unspecified, the proposed estimators share robustness from quantile regression and achieve nearly the same efficiency as the semiparametric maximum likelihood estimator for a variety of error distributions including the Normal, Studentâ€™s t, Cauchy distributions, etc. Furthermore, based on the proposed WCQR, we use the adaptive-LASSO to study variable selection for parametric part in the single-index models. For nonparametric part, the WCQR is augmented combining the equal weighted estimators with possibly different weights. Because of the use of weights, the estimation bias is eliminated asymptotically. By comparing asymptotic relative efficiency theoretically and numerically, WCQR estimation all outperforms the CQR estimation and some other estimate methods. Under regularity conditions, the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimations are established. The simulation studies and two real data applications are conducted to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.",2016,J. Multivar. Anal.
Prefix Continuity and Global Address Autoconfiguration in Ipv 6 Ad Hoc Networks,"Ad hoc networks are formed by the spontaneous collaboration of wireless nodes when no networking infrastructure is available. When communication to the Internet is desired, one or more nodes must act as gateways for the ad hoc network. In this case, global addressing of ad hoc nodes is required. This article presents a protocol which can be used by an ad hoc node to dynamically select a gateway and create an associated IPv6 global address. The core of our proposal is the concept ofprejix continuity. By building and maintaining a forest of logical spanning trees, our proposal ensures that there exists, between a node A and its gateway G, a path of nodes such that each node on this path uses the same prefix P as the node A and its gateway G. This concept results in an organized ad hoc network, in the sense that sub-networks (with respect to prefixes) are automatically created and dynamically maintained when multiple gateways are available. Moreover, the concept of prefix continuity ensures that each subnetwork forms a connected graph of nodes which all use an identical prefix. In contrast to traditional wired networks, this feature is not trivial in ad hoc networks. +The initial (long) version of this paper, as originally submitted and accepted for the MedHocNet'O5 workshop, is available at http://cn.cs.unibas.ch/pub/ t ~ a r t of this work was carried out during the tenure of an ERClM fellowship (see http://w.ercim.org for details).

Effects of Eight Herbicides on In Vitro Hatching of Heterodera glycines.,"Laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate effects of selected herbicides on hatching of free eggs of the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines. The herbicides used were Atrazine (atrazine), Basagran (bentazon), Bladex (cyanazine), Blazer (acifluorfen), Command (clomazone), Lasso (alachlor), Sonalan (ethalfluralin), and Treflan (trifluralin). Treatments comprised two concentrations of commercial herbicide formulations and deionized water and 3.14 mM zinc sulfate as negative and positive controls, respectively. Eggs were extracted from females and cysts, surface disinfested, and incubated in herbicide or control solutions at 25 +/- 2 C in darkness. Hatched second-stage juveniles were counted every other day for 24 days. Hatching of H. glycines eggs in 50 and 500 mug/ml Blazer was 42 to 67% less than that in deionized water and 6l to 78% less than that in zinc sulfate solution. Zinc sulfate significantly increased hatching activity in 50 mug/ml but not 500 mug/ml Blazer. The other herbicides tested at various concentrations had no significant effect on egg hatching. The specific component of Blazer inhibiting egg hatching is unknown. Suppression of hatching by Blazer indicates that this postemergence soybean herbicide may have a potential role in managing H. glycines.",1993,Journal of nematology
English Nominalization Paradoxes.,"English nominalizations turn verbs and adjectives into nouns systematically, but their meanings can change unpredictably. In the United States, college composition handbooks urge students to avoid using nominalizations, but elsewhere secondary students learn to write them responsibly and to recognize being manipulated when reading them. Nominalizations abound in business, science, and humanities and in textbooks and handbooks because they organize, generalize, classify, shorten explanations, maintain group identity, and display unchallengeable authority. They develop and build on previous knowledge, yet their assumptions increase comprehension difficulties. Furthermore, they can hide relevant information harmful to the writer's position. They contribute to coherence and lexical density but present special problems for second language learners. Tabulations of nearly 2,400 nominalizations in five morphological patterns show varying proportions in the opening paragraphs of 216 articles in a wide range of current periodicals as well as in compositions by first-year students in a community college. The use of nominalizations raises questions for education, for government publications, and also for some forward-looking scientists. (Contains a table of data and 18 references.)

A Low-Complexity Algorithm for Neighbor Discovery in Wireless Networks,"We study a neighbor discovery problem in wireless networks for which each node wishes to identify the so-called neighboring nodes within a single-hop communication. This problem can be optimally addressed using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, but its implementation is notoriously difficult in practice. In this letter, we present a low-complexity algorithm consisting of two stages: 1) we solve such problem using LASSO estimator that is a convex relaxation of MAP estimator to encourage a sparse solution; and 2) we find a desired binary vector (e.g., indicator of neighbor nodes) by taking a â€œhard-decisionâ€ with threshold, carefully chosen by exploiting fading statistics. Finally, we provide some numerical results to confirm that the proposed algorithm performs quite well.",2014,IEEE Communications Letters
Unknown Sparsity in Compressed Sensing: Denoising and Inference,"The theory of compressed sensing (CS) asserts that an unknown signal x Ïµ Rp can be accurately recovered from an underdetermined set of n linear measurements with n â‰ª p provided that x is sufficiently sparse. However, in applications, the degree of sparsity IlxIl<sub>0</sub> is typically unknown, and the problem of directly estimating IlxIl<sub>0</sub> has been a longstanding gap between theory and practice. A closely related issue is that IlxIl<sub>0</sub> is a highly idealized measure of sparsity, and for real signals with entries not equal to 0, the value IlxIl<sub>0</sub> = p is not a useful description of compressibility. In our previous conference paper [1] that examined these problems, we considered an alternative measure of soft sparsity, IlxIl<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>/IlxIl<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, and designed a procedure to estimate IlxIl<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>/IlxIl<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> that does not rely on sparsity assumptions. This paper offers a new deconvolution-based method for estimating unknown sparsity, which has wider applicability and sharper theoretical guarantees. In particular, we introduce a family of entropy-based sparsity measures sq(x) = (IlxIl<sub>q</sub>/IlxIl<sub>1</sub>)<sup>(q/1-q)</sup> parameterized by q Ïµ [0, âˆž]. This family interpolates between IlxIl<sub>0</sub> = s<sub>q</sub>(x) and IlxIl<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>/IlxIl<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> = s<sub>2</sub>(x) as q ranges over [0, 2]. For any q Ïµ (0, 2] \ 111, we propose an estimator sÌ‚<sub>q</sub>(x) whose relative error converges at the dimension-free rate of 1/âˆšn, even when p/n â†’ âˆž. Our main results also describe the limiting distribution of sÌ‚<sub>q</sub>(x), as well as some connections to basis pursuit denosing, the Lasso, deterministic measurement matrices, and inference problems in CS.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
On the Limited Potential of Azorean Fleshy Fruits for Oceanic Dispersal,"How plants arrived to originally sterile oceanic islands has puzzled naturalists for centuries. Dispersal syndromes (i.e., diaspore traits that promote dispersal by long-distance dispersal vectors), are generally considered to play a determinant role in assisting island colonization. However, the association between diaspore traits and the potential vectors by which diaspores are dispersed is not always obvious. Fleshy fruits, in particular, are considered to have evolved to promote the internal dispersal of seeds by frugivores (endozoochory), however some fleshy fruits can also float in saltwater, and thus be potentially transported by oceanic current (thalassochory). We performed saltwater floatation and viability experiments with fruits of the 14 European fleshy-fruited species that naturally colonized the Azores archipelago (North Atlantic Ocean). We show that only Corema album (a berry) and Juniperus oxycedrus (a fleshy cone) floated for as long as 60 days, the estimated minimum time needed to reach the Azores by oceanic currents. Regardless the floatation potential, exposure to saltwater largely reduced the viability of most seeds of the 14 species (46% of viability decline within 15 days and 77% within 60 days of immersion), including those of Corema album (61%) and Juniperus oxycedrus (83%). Floatability and viability trials suggest that while some fleshy-fruited species might have arrived to the Azores by oceanic currents, such would have required extreme meteorological events that could largely reduce the duration of the trip. Thus, the alternative hypothesis that fleshy-fruited species were mostly dependent on animal dispersers (endozoochory) to colonize these remote islands is reinforced.",2015,PLoS ONE
Sparse Learning in Gaussian Chain Graphs for State Space Models,"The graphical lasso is a popular method for estimating the structure of undirected Gaussian graphical models from data by penalized maximum likelihood. This paper extends the idea of structure estimation of graphical models by penalized maximum likelihood to Gaussian chain graph models for state space models. First we show how the class of linear Gaussian state space models can be interpreted in the chain graph set-up under both the LWF and AMP Markov properties, and we demonstrate how sparsity of the chain graph structure relates to sparsity of the model parameters. Exploiting this relation we propose two different penalized maximum likelihood estimators for recovering the chain graph structure from data depending on the Markov interpretation at hand. We frame the penalized maximum likelihood problem in a missing data set-up and carry out estimation in each of the two cases using the EM algorithm. The common E-step is solved by smoothing, and we solve the two different M-steps by utilizing existing methods from high dimensional statistics and convex optimization.",2018,
AcSel: selecting variables with accuracy in correlated datasets,"With the emergence of high-throughput technologies, it is possible to measure large amounts of data relatively at low cost. Such situations arise in many fields from sciences to humanities, and variable selection may be of great help to answer challenges that are specific to each of them. Variable selection may allow to know, among all measured variables, which are of interest and which are not. A lot of methods have been proposed to handle this issue, with the Lasso and other penalized regression as special cases. These methods fail in some cases and linear correlation between explanatory variables is the most common of these, especially in big datasets. In this article, we introduce AcSel, a wrapping algorithm able to enhance the accuracy of any variable selection method. To achieve this result, we use intensive computational simulations.",2015,arXiv: Computation
Quantile regression and variable selection of single-index coefficient model,"In this paper, a minimizing average check loss estimation (MACLE) procedure is proposed for the single-index coefficient model (SICM) in the framework of quantile regression (QR). The resulting estimators have the asymptotic normality and achieve the best convergence rate. Furthermore, a variable selection method is investigated for the QRSICM by combining MACLE method with the adaptive LASSO penalty, and we also established the oracle property of the proposed variable selection method. Extensive simulations are conducted to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed estimation and variable selection procedure under various error settings. Finally, we present a real-data application of the proposed approach.",2017,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
Genomic prediction and genomic variance partitioning of daily and residual feed intake in pigs using Bayesian Power Lasso models,"Improvement of feed efficiency is essential in pig breeding and selection for reduced residual feed intake (RFI) is an option. The study applied Bayesian Power LASSO (BPL) models with different power parameter to investigate genetic architecture, to predict genomic breeding values, and to partition genomic variance for RFI and daily feed intake (DFI). A total of 1272 Duroc pigs had both genotypic and phenotypic records for these traits. Significant SNPs were detected on chromosome 1 (SSC 1) and SSC 14 for RFI and on SSC 1 for DFI. BPL had similar accuracy and bias as GBLUP but power parameters had no effect on predictive ability. Genomic variance partitioning showed that SNP groups either by position (intron, exon, downstream, upstream and 5â€™UTR) or by function (missense and protein-altering) had similar average explained variance per SNP, except that 3â€™UTR had a higher value.",2014,

Graphical lasso and thresholding: Conditions for equivalence,"Graphical lasso is a popular method for learning the structure of an undirected graphical model, which is based on an l1 regularization technique. This method aims to find the conditional independence between the entries of a random vector by learning the sparsity pattern of the inverse correlation matrix from a limited number of samples. Graphical lasso is computationally expensive for large-scale problems. A numerically-cheap heuristic method for finding a graphical model is to simply threshold the sample correlation matrix. Recently, we have observed that the computationally-heavy graphical lasso and the simple thresholding method would produce the same solution for functional MRI data, electrical circuit data and many random systems, provided that a sparse graph is sought. The objective of this work is to develop a rigorous mathematical foundation for that observation. More precisely, we systematically study the relationship between these two methods by introducing the notions of sign-consistent and inverse-consistent matrices. We prove that thresholding and graphical lasso are equivalent if: (i) a certain matrix formed based on the sample correlation matrix is both sign-consistent and inverse-consistent, (ii) the gap between the largest thresholded and the smallest un-thresholded entries of the sample correlation matrix is not too small. We demonstrate the above conditions on acyclic graphs. These conditions are expected to be satisfied for sufficiently sparse graphical models.",2016,2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)
Computational methods for the identification and quantification of microbial organisms in metagenomes,"Metagenomics allows analyzing genomic material taken directly from the environment. In contrast to classical genomics, no purification of single organisms is performed and therefore the extracted genomic material reflects the composition of the original microbial community. The possible applications of metagenomics are manifold and the field has become increasingly popular due to the recent improvements in sequencing technologies. One of the most fundamental challenges in metagenomics is the identification and quantification of organisms in a sample, called taxonomic profiling. In this work, we present approaches to the following current problems in taxonomic profiling: First, differentiation between closely related organisms in metagenomic samples is still challenging. Second, the identification of novel organisms in metagenomic samples poses problems to current taxonomic profiling methods, especially when there is no suitable reference genome available. The contribution of this thesis comprises three major projects. First, we introduce the Genome Abundance Similarity Correction (GASiC) algorithm, a method that allows differentiating between and quantifying highly similar microbial organisms in a metagenomic sample. The method first estimates the similarities between the available reference genomes with a simulation approach. Based on the similarities, GASiC corrects the observed abundances of each reference genome using a nonnegative lasso approach. In several experiments we showed that the abundance estimates are highly accurate and reduce the error compared to current approaches by 5% to 60%. The approach was also successfully applied to metaproteomics. In the second project, we developed a statistical framework to fit mixtures of discrete distribution functions to the histograms of sequencing coverage depth after mapping metagenomic reads to reference genomes. We tailored a family of distributions for this particular application and modified the expectation-maximization algorithm to also fit discrete distributions when maximum likelihood estimation of the distribution parameters is not directly possible. The most important application of our framework is the genome validity score that measures how suitable a reference genome is for a particular (metagenomic) dataset. In the third project, we developed a taxonomic profiling tool, called MicrobeGPS. In contrast to previous approaches, MicrobeGPS identifies and characterizes organisms in a metagenome even if there are no suitable reference genomes available. Distances to existing reference genomes are measured with the genome validity score",2014,
Evaluation of Risk Factors for Parametrization of Cancer Models,"Cancer is the second most cause of death in Austria and around 38000 people are diagnosed with cancer each year [1]. The goal of this paper is to analyze methods for evaluation of risk factors in order to parametrize a micro simulation model for cancer prevalence. The focus of this paper is on modeling the survival time. This is done by the methods of survival analysis and model selection. Firstly, the survival function is estimated by the Kaplan-Meier estimate. Afterwards, a Cox proportional hazards regression is performed with all possible sets of parameters. These models are tested by twos with the likelihood ratio test in order to compare them. Another approach is the so-called Lasso method. This method puts a constraint on the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients and in most cases forces some of the coefficients to go to zero. The Akaike Information Criterion is also applied. All three methods are compared and the parameters which are supported, at least to a certain extent, by all of them are included in the estimation of the survival time of the prevalence model.",2015,Simul.

SCAD-penalized quantile regression for high-dimensional data analysis and variable selection,"type=""main""> The present penalized quantile variable selection methods are only applicable to finite number of predictors or do not have oracle property associated with estimator. This technique is considered as an alternative to ordinary least squares regression in case of the outliers and the heavy-tailed errors existing in linear models. The variable selection through quantile regression with diverging number of parameters is investigated in this paper. The convergence rate of estimator with smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty function is also studied. Moreover, the oracle property with proper selection of tuning parameter for quantile regression under certain regularity conditions is also established. In addition, the rank correlation screening method is used to accommodate ultra-high dimensional data settings. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate finite performance of the proposed estimator. The results of real data reveal that this approach provides substantially more information as compared with ordinary least squares, conventional quantile regression, and quantile lasso.",2015,Statistica Neerlandica
Geographically weighted elastic net logistic regression,"AbstractThis paper develops a localized approach to elastic net logistic regression, extending previous research describing a localized elastic net as an extension to a localized ridge regression or a localized lasso. All such models have the objective to capture data relationships that vary across space. Geographically weighted elastic net logistic regression is first evaluated through a simulation experiment and shown to provide a robust approach for local model selection and alleviating local collinearity, before application to two case studies: county-level voting patterns in the 2016 USA presidential election, examining the spatial structure of socio-economic factors associated with voting for Trump, and a species presenceâ€“absence data set linked to explanatory environmental and climatic factors at gridded locations covering mainland USA.
 The approach is compared with other logistic regressions. It improves prediction for the election case study only which exhibits much greater spatial heterogeneity in the binary response than the species case study. Model comparisons show that standard geographically weighted logistic regression over-estimated relationship non-stationarity because it fails to adequately deal with collinearity and model selection. Results are discussed in the context of predictor variable collinearity and selection and the heterogeneities that were observed. Ongoing work is investigating locally derived elastic net parameters.

Consistent Parameter Estimation for LASSO and Approximate Message Passing,"We consider the problem of recovering a vector $\beta_o \in \mathbb{R}^p$ from $n$ random and noisy linear observations $y= X\beta_o + w$, where $X$ is the measurement matrix and $w$ is noise. The LASSO estimate is given by the solution to the optimization problem $\hat{\beta}_{\lambda} = \arg \min_{\beta} \frac{1}{2} \|y-X\beta\|_2^2 + \lambda \| \beta \|_1$. Among the iterative algorithms that have been proposed for solving this optimization problem, approximate message passing (AMP) has attracted attention for its fast convergence. Despite significant progress in the theoretical analysis of the estimates of LASSO and AMP, little is known about their behavior as a function of the regularization parameter $\lambda$, or the thereshold parameters $\tau^t$. For instance the following basic questions have not yet been studied in the literature: (i) How does the size of the active set $\|\hat{\beta}^\lambda\|_0/p$ behave as a function of $\lambda$? (ii) How does the mean square error $\|\hat{\beta}_{\lambda} - \beta_o\|_2^2/p$ behave as a function of $\lambda$? (iii) How does $\|\beta^t - \beta_o \|_2^2/p$ behave as a function of $\tau^1, \ldots, \tau^{t-1}$? Answering these questions will help in addressing practical challenges regarding the optimal tuning of $\lambda$ or $\tau^1, \tau^2, \ldots$. This paper answers these questions in the asymptotic setting and shows how these results can be employed in deriving simple and theoretically optimal approaches for tuning the parameters $\tau^1, \ldots, \tau^t$ for AMP or $\lambda$ for LASSO. It also explores the connection between the optimal tuning of the parameters of AMP and the optimal tuning of LASSO.",2015,ArXiv
Near-ideal model selection by '1 minimization,"We consider the fundamental problem of estimating the mean of a vector y = X +z, where X is an n p design matrix in which one can have far more variables than observations and z is a stochastic error term|the so-called â€˜p > nâ€™ setup. When is sparse, or more generally, when there is a sparse subset of covariates providing a close approximation to the unknown mean vector, we ask whether or not it is possible to accurately estimate X using a computationally tractable algorithm. We show that in a surprisingly wide range of situations, the lasso happens to nearly select the best subset of variables. Quantitatively speaking, we prove that solving a simple quadratic program achieves a squared error within a logarithmic factor of the ideal mean squared error one would achieve with an oracle supplying perfect information about which variables should be included in the model and which variables should not. Interestingly, our results describe the average performance of the lasso; that is, the performance one can expect in an vast majority of cases where X is a sparse or nearly sparse superposition of variables, but not in all cases. Our results are nonasymptotic and widely applicable since they simply require that pairs of predictor variables are not too collinear.",2008,
Limit behavior of Koiter model for long cylindrical shells and Vlassov model,"We propose in this article to consider the limit behavior of the Koiter shell model when one of the characteristic length of the middle surface becomes very large with respect to the other. To do this, we perform a dimensional analysis of Koiter formulation which involves dimensionless numbers characterizing the geometry and the loading. Once reduced to a one-scale problem corresponding to thin-walled beams (long cylindrical shell), using asymptotic expansion technique, we address the limit behavior of Koiter model when the aspect ratio of the shell tends to zero. We prove that at the leading order, Koiter shell model degenerates to a one dimensional thin-walled beam model corresponding to the Vlassov one. Moreover, we obtain a general analytical expression of the geometric constants involved, that improves the empirical expression given by Vlassov.",2010,International Journal of Solids and Structures
Recognizing Human Interactions Using Group Feature Relevance in Multinomial Kernel Logistic Regression,"We propose a supervised approach incorporating group feature sparsity in multi-class kernel logistic regression (GFR-MKLR). The need for group sparsity arises in several practical situations where a subset of a set of factors can explain a predicted variable and each factor consists of a group of variables. We apply our approach for predicting human interactions based on body parts motion (e.g., hands, legs, head, etc.) where image features are organised in groups corresponding to body parts. Our approach, leads to sparse models by assigning weights to groups of features having the highest discrimination between different types of interactions. Experiments conducted on the UT-Interaction dataset have demonstrated the performance of our method with regard to stat-of-art methods. Introduction Models with sparsity constraint on solutions plays a central role in many high-dimensional classification problems (Hastie et al. 2015; Tibshirani 1996). In some cases, explanatory variables can be grouped together into separate factors influencing prediction of classes (Rao et al. 2016). This is the case, for example, in real world human activities captured in videos where a single activity can be decomposed into co-occurring actions performed by different persons (e.g., hand shaking, hugging, meeting, etc.) (Noceti et al. 2014). Each action, performed by the person, incurs the motion of different body parts depending on the gestures performed in the action (Aggarwal et al. 2011). Therefore, having sparse classification models selecting features at the gesture level is an important issue for better activity recognition. Sparse models usually prevent over-fitting and lead to more interpretable solutions in high-dimensional machine learning problems (Hastie et al. 2015; Rao et al. 2016). Group sparsity has been proposed in the past mainly as an extension to the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method (Tibshirani et al. 1996; Yuan et al. 2006). Contrarily to LASSO which performs feature selection for individual features, group LASSO performs selection for entire groups of variables, where each group constitutes a separate explanatory factor (Hastie et al. 2015). Copyright c âƒ 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. In particular, it can be assumed that the optimal sparsity will tend to involve clusters or groups of coefficients, corresponding to preexisting groups of features (Yuan et al. 2006). While the form of the groups can be a priori known (e.g., in activity recognition, a group can correspond to all features associated with a part of the body performing a gesture), the subset of groups that is relevant to the classification task at hand can be unknown. Recently, group LASSO methods have enjoyed a tremendous success in high dimensional classification problems (Vincent et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2013). It remains, however, that most proposed methods are limited to binary classification based on linear models. One of the earliest work on two person interaction recognition using motion trajectories was proposed by Datta et al. (Datta et al. 2002). This method tracks the trajectories of different parts of the body, then tries to dissociate violent from non-violent actions. In (Park et la. 2003), a hierarchical Bayesian network (BN) is proposed for interaction recognition. In this method, low-level nodes of the network are used to represent the pose of body parts, whereas high-level nodes estimate the overall body pose. (Ryoo et al. 2009) designed a method to measure structural similarity between sets of spatiotemporal features extracted from two videos. The authors then derived a kernel for action classification based on support vector machines (SVM). In the same vein, (Slimani et al. 2014) designed a correlation matrix between spatiotemporal features used to represent and classify interactions between persons using SVM. In (Meng et al. 2012), location and appearance of human joints are combined for interaction representation, which are then classified using SVM. Similarly to our approach, (Yuan et al. 2012) groups trajectories of densely-sampled key points in videos to form interaction components. Then, different interactions are compared using a spatiotemporal context kernel plugged in an SVM classifier. In (Do and Pustejovsky 2017), authors propose a compact representation for human-object interactions by comparing quantitative and qualitative features at two levels: frame level features (by visualizing human and objet trajectories) and event level (by summarizing the change between first, middle and last frames across event duration). These methods, however, incorporate sparsity at the level of interaction representation, whereas our method focuses on integrating sparsity in the classification stage of interactions. In this paper, we are interested in extending group sparsity in a multi-class setting for recognizing activities involving interactions between two individuals. Building on the success of kernel-based classification methods applied to single action recognition in videos (e.g., walking, sitting, etc.) (e.g., walking, sitting, etc.) (Aggarwal et al.2011; Schuldt et al. 2004), we propose a sparse model based on multinomial kernel logistic regression for recognition of activities involving interactions between persons. We represent motion of each moving person by tracking trajectories of key joints over the video frames. A group of features is defined for each trajectory and the concatenation of the group of features gives the final representation of each interaction. The direction of the trajectories generated by the persons are different among different types of interactions. To emphasize these differences and select the most discriminative trajectories, group of features weighting is integrated in kernel logistic regression instead of weighting each feature as in the case of LASSO. We show that our algorithm yields better results in comparison with several recent methods. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides details about interaction representation. Section 3 presents the proposed model for interaction classification. Section 4 presents some experimental results. We conclude the paper with a conclusion and future work perspectives. Interaction representation and classification In our method, we represent interactions using features extracted from the motion of human joints. On the constructed feature space, interaction recognition is performed using sparse multinomial kernel logistic regression. In the following section, we first describe human interaction representation. Then, we give the details of the proposed classification model based on group sparsity. The outline of the steps of our method is shown in Figure 1. Interaction representation For an input video with T frames, we extract the trajectory for all key points corresponding to a set of human joints J. For this purpose, we track each joint over video frames Ft, t âˆˆ {1, ..., T} using the algorithm proposed in (Yang et al. 2011). There are a total of 7 joints in the following order: head (H), right shoulder (RS), left shoulder (LS), right hand (RH), left hand (LH), right foot (RF) and left foot (LF), which are tracked over the video frames. The concatenation of joint locations (l1, l2, ..., lT ) with lt = (xt, yt) form the interaction trajectories trJi , i âˆˆ {1, ..., 14} (7 trajectories per person). In order to eliminate false joints detections over frames, we use a median filter to smooth the resulting trajectories. The static joints which give points or small trajectories are retained since the goal is to prove the implication or not of a joint movement to discriminate between different interactions. Figure 2 shows examples of extracted trajectories for punch, kick and point interactions. From each trajectory trJi , two features are computed to describe joints shape and motion. Given a trajectory of length T, its shape is described by : (âˆ†l1,âˆ†l2, ...,âˆ†lTâˆ’1), with âˆ†lt = (âˆ†lxt ,âˆ†lyt) = (xt+1âˆ’xt, yt+1âˆ’yt). The final displacement vectors according to the coordinates x and y are normalized as follow: Dx,y = (âˆ†l1,âˆ†l2, ...,âˆ†lTâˆ’1) âˆ‘Tâˆ’1 j=1 âˆ¥âˆ†ljâˆ¥ , (1) The normalized histogram of displacement HOD is then obtained by concatenating the histograms of Dx and Dy as follow HOD = [HODx,HODy].The motion of each trajectory is described by a local curvature in space and time coordinates, respectively, x,y and t (Rao et al. 2002). The curvature Ct at each frame t is defined in Eq. (2) Ct = x â€² ty â€²â€² t âˆ’ y â€² tx â€²â€² t (x â€²2 t + y â€²2 t + 1) 3/2 , (2) with, x â€² t, y â€² t, x â€²â€² t andy â€²â€² t are the first and second order temporal derivatives of the trajectory position, with: x â€² t = âˆ†lxt , y â€² t = âˆ†lyt , x â€²â€² t = âˆ†x â€² t, y â€²â€² t = âˆ†y â€² t and âˆ†t = 1 knowing that the trajectories are extracted over successive frames. The shape and the motion of the given trajectory is then described by a concatenation of normalized histogram of displacement and curvature to form a group of features: [HOD,HOC]. Finally, for each video two descriptors per trajectory are concatenated following a certain spatial order starting from right to left and from up to bottom as follow: [(HODtrH , HOCtrH )(p1), (HODtrRS ,HOCtrRS )(p1), ..., (HODtrLF ,HOCtrLF )(p1),HOD(trH ,HOCtrH )(p2), ..., (HODtrLF ,HOCtrLF )(p2)], p1 and p2 refers to person 1 and person 2 in a current video frame. Interaction classification Since each interaction is represented by a group of features of each trajectory, we aim in this section to discriminate between activities by weighting a discriminant group of features according to their contribution. This work is an extension of our previous work (Ouyed et Allili. 2014), instead of weighting individual features in a multinomial kernel logistic regression the weights are attributed for a group of features which refers to a trajectory descriptors. details of",2018,
Membership Affinity Lasso for Fuzzy Clustering,"Fuzzy clustering generates a membership vector for each data point in the dataset to indicate its belongingness to different clusters. This procedure can be regarded as an encoding process and the obtained vectors of memberships are the new representations of original data. Naturally, the affinities between new representations or the vectors of memberships should be consistent with the ones between original data points. For example, the data points close to each other should also take similar membership vectors. Such constraints on the affinities of memberships are valuable prior knowledge that should be imposed to the objective function of fuzzy clustering for better performance. To this end, we introduce the membership affinity lasso for fuzzy clustering in this paper. Utilizing alternating direction method of multipliers, an efficient approach is derived to optimize the general membership affinity lasso regularized fuzzy clustering model in offline manner. As illustrative examples, three new fuzzy clustering algorithms with the membership affinity lasso are proposed. Experiments on the synthetic and real data demonstrate the superiority and flexibility of the proposed algorithms.",2020,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems
Predicting EMG Data from M1 Neurons with Variational Bayesian Least Squares,"An increasing number of projects in neuroscience requires the statistical analysis of high dimensional data sets, as, for instance, in predicting behavior from neural firing or in operating artificial devices from brain recordings in brain-machine interfaces. Linear analysis techniques remain prevalent in such cases, but classical linear regression approaches are often numerically too fragile in high dimensions. In this paper, we address the question of whether EMG data collected from arm movements of monkeys can be faithfully reconstructed with linear approaches from neural activity in primary motor cortex (M1). To achieve robust data analysis, we develop a full Bayesian approach to linear regression that automatically detects and excludes irrelevant features in the data, regularizing against overfitting. In comparison with ordinary least squares, stepwise regression, partial least squares, LASSO regression and a brute force combinatorial search for the most predictive input features in the data, we demonstrate that the new Bayesian method offers a superior mixture of characteristics in terms of regularization against overfitting, computational efficiency and ease of use, demonstrating its potential as a drop-in replacement for other linear regression techniques. As neuroscientific results, our analyses demonstrate that EMG data can be well predicted from M1 neurons, further opening the path for possible real-time interfaces between brains and machines.",2005,
Microevolutionary processes in the stygobitic genus Typhlocirolana ( Isopoda Flabellifera Cirolanidae ) as inferred by partial 12 S and 16 S rDNA sequences,"Morocco is one of the regions of the world where many interesting discoveries have recently been made in the field of stygobiology, particularly concerning the cirolanid isopod fauna. One of the most interesting, variable and wide spread of these taxa is the perimediterranean stygobitic genus Typhlocirolana Racovitza, 1905, which has colonized the continental groundwater of Israel, Sicily, Spain, the Balearic Islands, Algeria and Morocco with several species. More populations have recently been found in Morocco, in some southern regions around Agadir, in High Atlas valleys near Marrakech and in the northeastern part of the country close to Oujda. The populations of these zones are not yet described and are the subject of this molecular analysis, together with other already designated species. To investigate the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history of the Typhlocirolana populations inhabiting the western Mediterranean basin, we analysed DNA sequences from the mitochondrial 12S and 16S rDNA genes. The molecular data were also used to infer the mechanisms driving the evolution of this thalassoid limnostygobitic cirolanid taxon, considered a good paleogeographic indicator because of its poor dispersion abilities. Vicariance because of paleogeographic events in the western Mediterranean basin played a prime evolutionary role in the Cirolanidae, as already suggested by morphological and ecological studies. Application of a molecular clock provided a time framework of the microevolutionary events occurring in Typhlocirolana populations over the last 40 myr.",2004,
Tropical Transpacific Shore Fishes,"Tropical transpacific fishes occur on both sides of the world's largest deep--water barrier to the migration of marine shore organisms, the 4,000-- to 7,000--km--wide Eastern Pacific Barrier (EPB). They include 64 epipelagic oceanic species and 126 species of shore fishes known from both the tropical eastern Pacific (TEP) and the central and West Pacific. The broad distributions of 19 of 39 circumglobal transpacific species of shore fishes offer no clues to the origin of their TEP populations; TEP populations of another 19 with disjunct Pacific distributions may represent isthmian relicts that originated from New World populations separated by the closure of the Central American isthmus. Eighty species of transpacific shore fishes likely migrated eastward to the TEP, and 22 species of shore fishes (12 of them isthmian relicts) and one oceanic species likely migrated westward from the TEP. Transpacific species constitute ~12% of the TEP's tropical shore fishes and 15--20% of shore fishes at islands on the western edge of the EPB. Eastward migrants constitute ~7% of the TEP's shore--fish fauna, and a similar proportion of TEP endemics may be derived from recent eastward immigration. Representation of transpacific species in different elements of the TEP fauna relates strongly to adult pelagic dispersal ability-they constitute almost all the epipelagic oceanic species, ~25% of the inshore pelagic species, but only 10% of the demersal shore fishes. Taxa that have multiple pelagic life--history stages are best represented among the transpacific species. Among demersal teleosts that have pelagic larvae, pelagic spawners are better represented than demersal spawners among transpacific species, perhaps because offshore larval development and longer pelagic larval durations provide the former with greater dispersal capabilities. There are strong phylogenetic effects on representation in the transpacific fauna: (1) elasmobranchs are proportionally better represented than teleosts, even teleosts with more pelagic life--history stages; (2) a pelagic juvenile stage with great dispersal potential allows tetraodontiforms that produce demersal or pelagic eggs to be well represented; and (3) various speciose central Pacific families with ""adequate"" larval dispersal characteristics lack transpacific species. El NiÃ±os potentially enhance eastward migration by increasing eastward flow and halving transit times across the EPB. However, that effect may be offset by low productivity and high temperatures in those eastbound flows. There is little clear evidence of strongly increased migration across the EPB during El NiÃ±os, including recent extreme events (1982--1983 and 1997--1998). During such events shore fishes in the TEP experience range expansions and become locally abundant at marginal areas such as the Galapagos, changes that can be confused with increased migration across the EPB. Although there is a strong bias toward eastward migration among the transpacific shore fishes, there likely is much more westward migration than previously realized: 20--25% of transpacific species may have migrated in that direction. Stronger eastbound than westbound currents can account for this bias. Westward migrants have better developed pelagic dispersal characteristics than many eastward migrants, suggesting that westward migration is more difficult. Many westward migrants associate with flotsam and flotsam--mediated migration is more likely to be westward. All westward migrants occur at Hawai'i, but only about one--fifth of them at the Marquesas. This bias may be due to: HawaiÃ”i being a larger target and in the path of most of the flotsam dispersal from the TEP; an eastward current that impinges on the Marquesas, reducing westward arrivals; and most propagules dispersing toward the tropical Marquesas originating in the temperate eastern Pacific. However, the Hawaiian Islands also are much better sampled than the Marquesas. Although the TEP reef--fish fauna may be depauperate relative to that of the Indo--Malayan ""center of diversity,"" it is as rich as the faunas of islands on the western side of the EPB. Hence a preponderance of eastward migration does not represent a response to a richness gradient across that barrier. There is little evidence that a paucity of ecological groups in the native TEP fauna is primarily responsible for the structure of the eastward--migrant fauna. Rather, eastward migrants may simply represent a cross section of those in the donor fauna, tempered by phylogenetic variation in dispersal ability. Because few central Pacific fishes can live only on live corals and coral reefs, the rarity of such reefs in the TEP is unlikely to strongly limit eastward migration. Differences between oceanic and adjacent continental reef--fish faunas in the West Pacific indicate that each is strongly tied to its respective habitat. Hence, the rarity in the TEP of the (overwhelmingly) most abundant habitat present in the central Pacific-tropical oceanic reefs-may strongly limit migration in both directions across the EPB: there is little suitable habitat for eastward migrants in the TEP and few suitable species and tiny source populations for westward migrants. The global effects that oceanic/continental habitat differences have on reef--fish biogeography need further assessment. Genetic data on ~18% of the transpacific species indicate: that conspecific populations of oceanic species (especially) and shore fishes are genetically well connected across the EPB; that circumtropical taxa in the TEP include isolated isthmian relicts and recent eastward migrants; that all five TEP species of one circumtropical genus (Thalassoma) were derived by several eastward invasions after the closure of the Isthmus of Panama; that some isolated Hawaiian central Pacific populations were established by postisthmian invasion from the TEP; and that Indo--central Pacific species unsuspectedly can co--occur with their endemic sibling sisters in the TEP. Genetic data support distributional data that indicate a strong preponderance of eastward migration across the EPB but also more westward migration than previously thought. Future genetic studies should resolve a question that distributional data cannot: how many widespread presumed eastward--migrant transpacific species actually originated by westward migration from the TEP?",2004,Pacific Science
Novel Multiple miRNA-Based Signatures for Predicting Overall Survival and Recurrence-Free Survival of Colorectal Cancer Patients,"BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer (CRC) has become a heavy health burden around the world, accounting for about 10% of newly diagnosed cancer cases. In the present study, we aimed to establish the miRNA-based prediction signature to assess the prognosis of CRC patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 451 CRC patients' expression profiles and clinical information were download from the TCGA database. LASSO Cox regression was conducted to construct the overall survival (OS)- and recurrence-free survival (RFS)-associated prediction signatures, by which CRC patients were divided into low- and high-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to explore the discriminatory ability and stability of the signatures. Functional enrichment analyses were performed to identify the probable mechanisms. RESULTS miRNA-216a, miRNA-887, miRNA-376b, and miRNA-891a were used to build the prediction formula associated with OS, while miR-1343, miR-149, miR-181a-1, miR-217, miR-3130-1, miR-378a, miR-542, miR-6716, miR-7-3, miR-7702, miR-677, and miR-891a were obtained to construct the formula related to RFS. K-M curve and ROC curve revealed the good discrimination and efficiency of OS in the training (P<0.001, AUC=0.712) and validation cohorts (P=0.019, AUC=0.657), as well as the results of RFS in the training (P<0.001, AUC=0.714) and validation cohorts (P=0.042, AUC=0.651). The function annotations for the targeted genes of these miRNAs show the potential mechanisms of CRC. CONCLUSIONS We established 2 novel miRNA-based prediction signatures of OS and RFS, which are reliable tools to assess the prognosis of CRC patients.",2019,Medical Science Monitor : International Medical Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research
"RNA-Seq Based Transcriptome Assembly: Sparsity, Bias Correction and Multiple Sample Comparison","Author(s): Li, Wei | Advisor(s): Jiang, Tao | Abstract: RNA-Seq, or deep-sequencing of RNAs, is a new technology for transcriptome profiling using second generation sequencing. RNA-Seq has been widely used to identify and quantify transcriptomes at an unprecedented high resolution and low cost. An important computational problem arising from RNA-Seq is transcriptome assembly, in which the structures of transcripts (and their expression levels) are inferred simultaneously from RNA-Seq data. RNA-Seq transcriptome assembly allows for the detection of structural and quantitative changes of transcripts between samples, paving the way for novel biological discoveries. However, the problem of RNA-Seq transcriptome assembly is challenging because: (i) the complicated alternative splicing patterns of some genes result in a huge number of possible transcripts, (ii) different kinds of biases in RNA-Seq reads (including sequencing, positional and mappability biases) decrease the accuracy of assembly and expression level estimation algorithms, and (iii) the existing assembly tools can only reconstruct transcripts from a single sample, leading to a high false positive rate for comparing RNA-Seq experiments from multiple samples. We propose three different algorithms to address these challenges. First, we design a transcriptome assembly tool, IsoLasso, that balances different objectives (prediction accuracy, sparsity, interpretation) and takes advantage of the sparsity of expressed transcripts. Second, we use the quasi-multinomial distribution to model the RNA-Seq biases, and design a new algorithm, CEM, to handle different biases in both transcriptome assembly and transcript expression level estimation. Finally, we propose a multiple-sample transcriptome assembly tool, ISP, to assemble transcripts directly from RNA-Seq data of multiple samples. ISP reaches an improved performance compared to the assembly tools that consider one sample at a time, and helps to improve the accuracy of downstream differential analysis of transcriptomes between samples.",2012,
"SuRF: a New Method for Sparse Variable Selection, with Application in Microbiome Data Analysis","In this paper, we present a new variable selection method for regression and classification purposes. Our method, called Subsampling Ranking Forward selection (SuRF), is based on LASSO penalised regression, subsampling and forward-selection methods. SuRF offers major advantages over existing variable selection methods in terms of both sparsity of selected models and model inference. We provide an R package that can implement our method for generalized linear models. We apply our method to classification problems from microbiome data, using a novel agglomeration approach to deal with the special tree-like correlation structure of the variables. Existing methods arbitrarily choose a taxonomic level a priori before performing the analysis, whereas by combining SuRF with these aggregated variables, we are able to identify the key biomarkers at the appropriate taxonomic level, as suggested by the data. We present simulations in multiple sparse settings to demonstrate that our approach performs better than several other popularly used existing approaches in recovering the true variables. We apply SuRF to two microbiome data sets: one about prediction of pouchitis and another for identifying samples from two healthy individuals. We find that SuRF can provide a better or comparable prediction with other methods while controlling the false positive rate of variable selection.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Identification of optimal prediction models using multi-omic data for selecting hybrid rice,"Genomic prediction benefits hybrid rice breeding by increasing selection intensity and accelerating breeding cycles. With the rapid advancement of technology, other omic data, such as metabolomic data and transcriptomic data, are readily available for predicting breeding values for agronomically important traits. In this study, the best prediction strategies were determined for yield, 1000 grain weight, number of grains per panicle, and number of tillers per plant of hybrid rice (derived from recombinant inbred lines) by comprehensively evaluating all possible combinations of omic datasets with different prediction methods. It was demonstrated that, in rice, the predictions using a combination of genomic and metabolomic data generally produce better results than single-omics predictions or predictions based on other combined omic data. Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) appears to be the most efficient prediction method compared to the other commonly used approaches, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), stochastic search variable selection (SSVS), support vector machines with radial basis function and epsilon regression (SVM-R(EPS)), support vector machines with radial basis function and nu regression (SVM-R(NU)), support vector machines with polynomial kernel and epsilon regression (SVM-P(EPS)), support vector machines with polynomial kernel and nu regression (SVM-P(NU)) and partial least squares regression (PLS). This study has provided guidelines for selection of hybrid rice in terms of which types of omic datasets and which method should be used to achieve higher trait predictability. The answer to these questions will benefit academic research and will also greatly reduce the operative cost for the industry which specializes in breeding and selection.",2019,Heredity
What explains health in persons with low vision,"Background 
Visual impairment is associated with important limitations in functioning. The international Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) relies on a globally accepted framework for classifying problems in functioning and contextual factors such as environmental factors and personal factors, that might influence functioning. Its comprehensive perspective, including biological, individual and social aspects of health, enables the ICF to describe the whole health experience of persons with visual impairment (PVI). The objectives of this study are (1) to analyze whether ICF can be used to comprehensively describe the problems in functioning of PVI and the environmental factors that influence their lives and (2) to select the ICF categories that best capture self-perceived health of PVI. 
 
Methods 
Data from persons with visual impairment (VI) (Visual acuity â‰¤ 20/63) were collected, including socio-demographic data, vision-related data, the Extended ICF Checklist and the visual analogue scale of the EuroQol-5D, to assess self-perceived health. Patients included in the study furthermore had to be at least 18 years old, had to be informed about the study and understand its purpose as well as sign the informed consent form. Data were collected by two medical researchers in the Eye Clinic of the Ludwig-Maximilian-University Munich, Germany. Descriptive statistics and a group Lasso regression were performed. The main outcome measures were functioning defined as impairments in Body functions, Body structures, limitations in Activities and restrictions in Participation, influencing Environmental factors and self-perceived health. 
 
Results 
66 females and 39 males with VI with a mean age of 63 years at interview were included in the study. The mean time since diagnosis was 17 years. In total, 120 ICF categories covering a broad range of Body functions, Body structures, aspects of Activities and Participation and Environmental factors were identified. Thirteen ICF categories that best capture self-perceived health were selected based on the Group Lasso regression. While Activities-and-Participation categories were selected most frequently, the greatest impact on self-perceived health was found in Body-functions categories. 
 
Conclusion 
The ICF can be used as a framework to comprehensively describe the problems of persons with VI and the Environmental factors which influence their lives. 
There are plenty of ICF categories, Environmental-factors categories in particular, which are relevant to persons with VI, but have hardly ever been taken into consideration in literature and VI-specific, patient-reported outcome measures.",2016,
Sparse Estimation and Inference for Censored Median Regression.,"Censored median regression has proved useful for analyzing survival data in complicated situations, say, when the variance is heteroscedastic or the data contain outliers. In this paper, we study the sparse estimation for censored median regression models, which is an important problem for high dimensional survival data analysis. In particular, a new procedure is proposed to minimize an inverse-censoring-probability weighted least absolute deviation loss subject to the adaptive LASSO penalty and result in a sparse and robust median estimator. We show that, with a proper choice of the tuning parameter, the procedure can identify the underlying sparse model consistently and has desired large-sample properties including root-n consistency and the asymptotic normality. The procedure also enjoys great advantages in computation, since its entire solution path can be obtained efficiently. Furthermore, we propose a resampling method to estimate the variance of the estimator. The performance of the procedure is illustrated by extensive simulations and two real data applications including one microarray gene expression survival data.",2010,Journal of statistical planning and inference
"Sparse multiple factor analysis to integrate genetic data, neuroimaging features, and attentionâ€deficit/hyperactivity disorder domains","OBJECTIVES
We proposed the application of a multivariate cross-sectional framework based on a combination of a variable selection method and a multiple factor analysis (MFA) in order to identify complex meaningful biological signals related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and hyperactivity/inattention domains.


METHODS
The study included 135 children from the general population with genomic and neuroimaging data. ADHD symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire based on ADHD-DSM-IV criteria. In all analyses, the raw sum scores of the hyperactivity and inattention domains and total ADHD were used. The analytical framework comprised two steps. First, zero-inflated negative binomial linear model via penalized maximum likelihood (LASSO-ZINB) was performed. Second, the most predictive features obtained with LASSO-ZINB were used as input for the MFA.


RESULTS
We observed significant relationships between ADHD symptoms and hyperactivity and inattention domains with white matter, gray matter regions, and cerebellum, as well as with loci within chromosome 1.


CONCLUSIONS
Multivariate methods can be used to advance the neurobiological characterization of complex diseases, improving the statistical power with respect to univariate methods, allowing the identification of meaningful biological signals in Imaging Genetic studies.",2018,International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research
Methods for Analysis of Big Data.: A Combination of the Lasso Method and the Case-Crossover Design for Investigating Potential Drug Side Effects on Myocardial Infarction,"The current master thesis was written during the academic year 2013 âˆ’ 2014 at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). It concerns the im- plementation of the case-crossover design in a combination with the lasso method, for investigating potential effects of a set of drugs on myocardial infarction. The datasets that were used in the analysis were generated based on information about the usage frequencies of the drugs in the period from 2008 to 2012. Furthermore, the thesis provides a brief explanation of how the lasso method can be used in the case of generalized linear models, as well as the case-crossover design. The main analysis was based on two datasets such that probably weak aspects of the lasso could be discovered. Another aspect of the current thesis was the implementation of the relatively new inference method for the lasso, as well as the implementa- tion of two forms of the lasso method: simple lasso and bootstrap lasso. Finally, the current thesis shows, with numerical results, that the bootstrap form of lasso is an effective variable selection method, and that the lasso inference is not yet sufficiently developed.",2014,
Non-Gaussian spatial modeling in index flood estimation,"Index flood estimation is important in regionalization procedure to solve an issue of ungauged catchment that has received great attention among hydrologists. The UK index flood estimation model known as the FEH-QMED model is a well established one with nonlinear effect of explanatory variables identified. However the shortcomings of current research in literature such as not taking into account a spatial dependency and non-Gausianity that exist in the flooding data motivated us to investigate further. This thesis aims to improve the existing methodology in index flood estimation model, where FEH-QMED model is chosen as the benchmark. Three objectives that have been developed in this thesis are: (i) to explore the shortcomings of the current research with a possibly improved model in estimating the UK index flood, (ii) to develop a more efficient statistical model in estimating the index flood that better fits the UK flooding data, and (iii) to discover more relevant predictive catchment characteristics that may improve the index flood estimation model. To answer the objectives, statistical methods have been proposed and applied into the UK flooding data analysis to establish new index flood regression models detailedly discussed in chapters of the thesis respectively. In Chapter 2 we apply the spatial additive and spatial error analyses into the UK flooding data to explore possibly improved models for the UK index flood estimation. Chapter 3 proposes a new spatial error model with skewed normal distribution for residuals and develops a maximum likelihood computational algorithm to apply into the UK flooding data for the purpose of establishing a new index flood estimation model. Chapter 4 is focused on model selection of index flood estimation model by proposing a panelized likelihood estimation method that utilizes adaptive Lasso as a regularization tool in variable selection of all available catchment characteristics in the UK flooding data source. We also present the simulations to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed statistical methods. In comparison study, AIC scores have been used as model selection criteria, while to measure the performance of different models, the percentage improvement in mean square prediction error relative to the updated FEH-QMED model in Kjeldsen and Jones (2010) is applied. The obtained results demonstrate that the skewed spatial error flood model that is established by using statistical method suggested in Chapter 4 outperforms the others and can significantly improve the FEH-QMED model in estimating the UK index flood.",2018,

Alternative strategies for selecting subsets of predicting SNPs by LASSO-LARS procedure,"BackgroundThe least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) can be used to predict SNP effects. This operator has the desirable feature of including in the model only a subset of explanatory SNPs, which can be useful both in QTL detection and GWS studies. LASSO solutions can be obtained by the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm. The big issue with this procedure is to define the best constraint (t), i.e. the upper bound of the sum of absolute value of the SNP effects which roughly corresponds to the number of SNPs to be selected. Usai et al. (2009) dealt with this problem by a cross-validation approach and defined t as the average number of selected SNPs overall replications. Nevertheless, in small size populations, such estimator could give underestimated values of t. Here we propose two alternative ways to define t and compared them with the ""classical"" one.MethodsThe first (strategy 1), was based on 1,000 cross-validations carried out by randomly splitting the reference population (2,000 individuals with performance) into two halves. The value of t was the number of SNPs which occurred in more than 5% of replications. The second (strategy 2), which did not use cross-validations, was based on the minimization of the Cp-type selection criterion which depends on the number of selected SNPs and the expected residual variance.ResultsThe size of the subset of selected SNPs was 46, 189 and 64 for the classical approach, strategy 1 and 2 respectively. Classical and strategy 2 gave similar results and indicated quite clearly the regions were QTL with additive effects were located. Strategy 1 confirmed such regions and added further positions which gave a less clear scenario. Correlation between GEBVs estimated with the three strategies and TBVs in progenies without phenotypes were 0.9237, 0.9000 and 0.9240 for classical, strategy 1 and 2 respectively.ConclusionsThis suggests that the Cp-type selection criterion is a valid alternative to the cross-validations to define the best constraint for selecting subsets of predicting SNPs by LASSO-LARS procedure.",2012,BMC Proceedings
Salty worlds underwater.,"Yakimov and colleagues (2015) present in this issue of Environmental Microbiology the analysis of life under one of the most extreme environments on Earth: a submarine anoxic hypersaline lake, located in the Eastern Mediterranean basin. This work opens up fascinating questions regarding the geochemical windows for microbial extremophiles, the evolution and dispersal of communities in such physically isolated environments, and the metabolisms and stress tolerance mechanisms of their inhabitants. However, the interest of this work goes beyond microbial ecology and will likely have an impact on the search for extra-terrestrial life. Deep down, thousands of metres below sea level, the Mediterranean Sea harbours hypersaline lakes derived from the dissolution of evaporites formed during the Messinian salinity crisis. Geologists use that name to refer to the desiccation events that took place in the Mediterranean about 6 million years ago which resulted in a massive precipitation of sea salts that gave rise to evaporitic rocks of different compositions (De Lange et al., 2008). Due to several geological processes in the Mediterranean Ridge, some of these Messinian evaporites ended up dissolved in submarine brine lakes within confined depressions. These extreme systems, known as â€˜deep hypersaline anoxic lakesâ€™ (DHALs), have salt concentrations 5â€“10 times higher than seawater, lack oxygen and light, and are exposed to high pressure. Given their high density, DHALs are separated from the overlaying seawater by a thin and normally very stable chemo/redox/pycnocline characterized by a stratified succession of different electron donors and acceptors that can support a diverse microbial community. These transition zones are normally enriched in comparison to overlying seawater and underlying brines (Mapelli et al., 2012). In fact, some DHALS and their overlying seawater can be populated by a diverse community of extremely halophilic microbes, including lineages that were originally discovered in these systems, which so far remain uncultured. This is the case for instance of the euryarchaea MSBL-1 (a putative group of methanogens) or the bacteria KB-1, which have been shown to establish trophic cooperation (Yakimov et al., 2013). Since the 1980s (De Lange and Ten Haven, 1983), a total of eight DHALs have been discovered on the Mediterranean floor (Fig. 1), although microbiology studies started only a decade ago (Van der Wielen et al., 2005). These DHALs differ in their salt composition and, accordingly, in their microbial communities. It was the study of one such system, the Discovery basin, that set the limits of life in MgCl2-containing environments. In a seminal paper, Hallsworth and colleagues (2007) showed that it is MgCl2 and not salt concentration per se that restricts life in many hypersaline environments. This is due to the effects that different salts can have on cells. Although all solutes reduce water availability (i.e. water activity), some, like MgCl2, can act as chaotropes, weakening electrostatic interactions and hence destabilizing biological molecules. Others, like NaCl, are kosmotropes that strengthen these interactions and stabilize macromolecules. By monitoring signatures of life at the 0.05â€“5.05 M MgCl2 seawater : brine interface of the Discovery basin, the authors showed that chaotropicity, rather than water activity reduction, inhibited life by denaturing biological molecules. These authors stated that, in the absence of kosmotropes, the upper MgCl2 concentration for life is about 2.3 M, although they left the door open to the existence of life at higher concentrations in the presence of stabilizing solutes. In this issue, a team including many of the authors of Hallsworth and colleagues (2007) shows that indeed life can exist above the MgCl2 limit provided that other kosmotropic salts compensate for its chaotropic effects (Yakimov et al., 2015). These authors describe the exciting discovery of Lake Kryos, a new DHAL, so far the largest athalassohaline formation on Earth, with a salinity of 47% and around 4.3 M MgCl2. Together with the Discovery basin and the Antarctic Don Juan pond, these are the three saltiest aquatic habitats described so far on our planet. Lake Kryos has a composition similar to the *For correspondence. E-mail anton@ua.es; Tel. 34 965903870; Fax 34 965909569. bs_bs_banner",2015,Environmental microbiology
Exact Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Truncated Multivariate Gaussians,"We present a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from multivariate Gaussian distributions in which the target space is constrained by linear and quadratic inequalities or products thereof. The Hamiltonian equations of motion can be integrated exactly and there are no parameters to tune. The algorithm mixes faster and is more efficient than Gibbs sampling. The runtime depends on the number and shape of the constraints but the algorithm is highly parallelizable. In many cases, we can exploit special structure in the covariance matrices of the untruncated Gaussian to further speed up the runtime. A simple extension of the algorithm permits sampling from distributions whose log-density is piecewise quadratic, as in the â€œBayesian Lassoâ€ model.",2012,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
Warming-related shifts in the distribution of two competing coastal wrasses.,"Warming induces organisms to adapt or to move to track thermal optima, driving novel interspecific interactions or altering pre-existing ones. We investigated how rising temperatures can affect the distribution of two antagonist Mediterranean wrasses: the 'warm-water' Thalassoma pavo and the 'cool-water' Coris julis. Using field surveys and an extensive database of depth-related patterns of distribution of wrasses across 346 sites, last-decade and projected patterns of distribution for the middle (2040-2059) and the end of century (2080-2099) were analysed by a multivariate model-based framework. Results show that T.Â pavo dominates shallow waters at warmest locations, where C.Â julis locates deeper. The northernmost shallow locations are dominated by C.Â julis where T.Â pavo abundance is low. Projections suggest that the W-Mediterranean will become more suitable for T.Â pavo whilst large sectors of the E-Mediterranean will be unsuitable for C.Â julis, progressively restricting its distribution range. These shifts might result in fish communities' re-arrangement and novel functional responses throughout the food-web.",2016,Marine environmental research
Flexible Collaborative Estimation of the Average Causal Effect of a Treatment using the Outcome-Highly-Adaptive Lasso,"Many estimators of the average causal effect of an intervention require estimation of the propensity score, the outcome regression, or both. For these estimators, we must carefully con- sider how to estimate the relevant regressions. It is often beneficial to utilize flexible techniques such as semiparametric regression or machine learning. However, optimal estimation of the regression function does not necessarily lead to optimal estimation of the average causal effect. Therefore, it is important to consider criteria for evaluating regression estimators and selecting hyper-parameters. A recent proposal addressed these issues via the outcome-adaptive lasso, a penalized regression technique for estimating the propensity score. We build on this proposal and offer a method that is simultaneously more flexible and more efficient than the previous pro- posal. We propose the outcome-highly-adaptive LASSO, a semi-parametric regression estimator designed to down-weight regions of the confounder space that do not contribute variation to the outcome regression. We show that tuning this method using collaborative targeted learning leads to superior finite-sample performance relative to competing estimators.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
ASICS: an automatic method for identification and quantification of metabolites in complex 1D 1H NMR spectra,"IntroductionExperiments in metabolomics rely on the identification and quantification of metabolites in complex biological mixtures. This remains one of the major challenges in NMR/mass spectrometry analysis of metabolic profiles. These features are mandatory to make metabolomics asserting a general approach to test a priori formulated hypotheses on the basis of exhaustive metabolome characterization rather than an exploratory tool dealing with unknown metabolic features.ObjectivesIn this article we propose a method, named ASICS, based on a strong statistical theory that handles automatically the metabolites identification and quantification in proton NMR spectra.MethodsA statistical linear model is built to explain a complex spectrum using a library containing pure metabolite spectra. This model can handle local or global chemical shift variations due to experimental conditions using a warping function. A statistical lasso-type estimator identifies and quantifies the metabolites in the complex spectrum. This estimator shows good statistical properties and handles peak overlapping issues.ResultsThe performances of the method were investigated on known mixtures (such as synthetic urine) and on plasma datasets from duck and human. Results show noteworthy performances, outperforming current existing methods.ConclusionASICS is a completely automated procedure to identify and quantify metabolites in 1H NMR spectra of biological mixtures. It will enable empowering NMR-based metabolomics by quickly and accurately helping experts to obtain metabolic profiles.",2017,Metabolomics
Breeding Biology of an Interior Least Tern (Sterna Antillarum Athalassos) Colony in Childress County of North Texas,"This study documented nest success, nest initiation chronology and nest site selection for interior least terns (Sterna antillarum athalassos) along the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River in Childress County, Texas during 1998. Terns experienced a 65% nest success rate (Mayfield estimate 71%) and clutch sizes ranged from 1 -3 eggs (x = 2.25) for 20 nests. Seventy percent of all nests were initiated during the first 20 days of June, which coincided with the highest number of adult terns observed on the study site. All nests were found on gravel/sand bars in the river basin; 25% were placed on gravel and 75% were placed on sand. Sixty-five percent of tern nests were located within IS cm of driftwood and/or rocks, but nests were not more frequently associated with objects than random sites (P > 0.05). Nests were generally > 10 m from vegetative cover and 200 m from surface water. However, habitat variables (i.e., distances to upland, mudflat, water and vegetative cover) did not vary (P > 0.05) between nests and random sites nor between successful and nonsuccessful nests. This colony of interior least terns was last documented in the mid 1980s and evidently has some degree of stability. Conservation efforts should focus on protecting, restoring and enhancing riparian wetland habitats in the High and Rolling Plains of Texas for this endangered species.",2003,Texas Journal of Science
Study of the Hydrophilic Properties of Toughened Glass,"In this study, we assessed the hydrophilic characteristics of the surface of toughened glass used in smartphones by investigating the optical properties and contact angle characteristics of the plasma device. In this study, the characteristics were different depending on the partial pressure of the gas, input voltage, and degree of ionization of argon gas. In this study, the surface of the toughened glass became more hydrophilic, as indicated by contact angle and light spectrum, after plasma treatment than before the treatment.Keywords: Atmospheric pressure, Plasma, Hydrophilic, Contact angle, Toughened glassOCIS codes: (240.0240) Optics at Surfaces; (240.6680) Surface plasmons",2013,Korean Journal of Optics and Photonics
A 6-gene leukemic stem cell score identifies high risk pediatric acute myeloid leukemia,"Recently, mRNA-expression signature enriched in LSCs was used to create a 17-gene leukemic stem cell (LSC17) score predictive of prognosis in adult AML. By fitting a Cox-LASSO regression model to the clinical outcome and gene-expression levels of LSC enriched genes in 163 pediatric participants of the AML02 multi-center clinical trial (NCT00136084), we developed a six-gene LSC score of prognostic value in pediatric AML (pLSC6). In the AML02 cohort, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of patients within low-pLSC6 group (nâ€‰=â€‰97) was 78.3 (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰70.5â€“86.9%) as compared with 34.5(95% CIâ€‰=â€‰24.7â€“48.2 %) in patients within high-pLSC6 group (nâ€‰=â€‰66 subjects), pâ€‰<â€‰0.00001. pLSC6 remained significantly associated with EFS and overall survival (OS) after adjusting for induction 1-MRD status, risk-group, FLT3-status, WBC-count at diagnosis and age. pLSC6 formula developed in the AML02 cohort was validated in the pediatric AML-TARGET project data (nâ€‰=â€‰205), confirming its prognostic value in both single-predictor and multiple-predictor Cox regression models. In both cohorts, pLSC6 predicted outcome of transplant patients, suggesting it as a useful criterion for transplant referrals. Our results suggest that pLSC6 score holds promise in redefining initial risk-stratification and identifying poor risk AML thereby providing guidance for developing novel treatment strategies.",2019,Leukemia
Left atrial circumferential ablation of pulmonary veins for atrial fibrillation guided by EnSite NavX mapping system and circle mapping catheter,"Objective To study the effectiveness of left atrial circumferential ablation of pulmonary veins for atrial fibrillation(AF) guided by EnSite NavX mapping system,and circle mapping catheter(Lasso).Methods Seventeen patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF were included.Real time 3-dimensional left artial(LA) and pulmonary veins(PVs) maps were constructed through EnSite-NavX mapping system,and Lasso.Isolation of pulmonary veins was performed by encircle the left and right side PVs at a distance of 1 to 2 cm away from the ostium of PVs.Results Seventeen patients all reached the endpoint of ablation completely.The mean procedure time and fluoroscopy time were(226.1Â±36.2) minutes and (41.3Â±12.8) minutes,respectively.Mean radiofrequency energy delivery time was(61.9Â±15.4) minutes.After 60 days,recurrence of AF occurred in two patients,of whom one received a repeat ablation successfully.During 4~30 months of follow-up,fourteen patients(82.3%) were free of AF without any antiarrhythmic drugs.Recurrence of AF occurred in three(17.7%) patients with less times and duration of attack and effectively controlled by amiodarone.No complications occurred during the procedure and the follow-up period.Conclusion Pulmonary veins circumferential linear ablation of atrial fibrillation guided by EnSite-NavX mapping system and Lasso is effective and safe.",2008,Jiangsu Medical Journal

Bayesian sequential sparse sampling,We consider the sequential reconstruction of source waveforms under a sparsity constraint from a Bayesian perspective. We assume that the wave field that is observed by a sensor array is from a spatially sparse source distribution. A spatially weighted Laplace-like prior is assumed for the source distribution and the corresponding weighted LASSO cost function is derived. We demonstrate the sequential sparse sampling using a line array and track the direction of arrival. In a real world example we track a source using a 2D array.,2013,Journal of the Acoustical Society of America
