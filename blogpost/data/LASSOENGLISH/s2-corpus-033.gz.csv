Role of alcohol in clinical nephrology,"SummaryDifferent nephrological derangements are observed in severe alcoholics. Until now the direct toxicity of ethanol is only shown in the fetal alcohol syndrome with various malformations of the genitourinary tract. In the adult the kidney is often involved in the development, maintenance and counterregulation of complex electrolyte disturbances like phosphate and potassium hypoglycemia etc. The alcohol associated retention of urate, induced by hyperlactatemia and/or increasedÎ²-hydroxybutyrate concentration is only rarely complicated by urate nephropathy. Alcohol intoxication (acute and chronic) predisposes to rhabdomyolysis with the risk of acute renal failure. There are some hints that chronic alcoholism with myopathy increases the vulnerability of the kidney for further toxic agents. In rats glycerol induced renal failure is enhanced by alcohol pretreatment. Finally, regular alcohol consumption raises the blood pressure, which per se is a risk factor for renal damage.ZusammenfassungNephrologisch wichtige StÃ¶rungen des schwereren Alkoholismus manifestieren sich auf verschiedenen Ebenen. Eine direkte SchÃ¤digung der Nieren und abfÃ¼hrenden Harnwege ist bislang ausschlieÃŸlich bei alkoholischer Embryopathie nachgewiesen. Beim Erwachsenen dominieren unspezifische und komplexe ElektrolytstÃ¶rungen mit Akzentuierung im Alkohol-Entzugssyndrom. Die Niere ist nicht selten primÃ¤re Ursache verschiedener StÃ¶rungen, sie trÃ¤gt ferner zur â€” oft inadÃ¤quaten â€” Kompensation extrarenal entstandener StoffwechselstÃ¶rungen (z.B. Phosphatmangel, HypoglykÃ¤mie) bei. Der alkoholassoziierten Uratretention, hervorgerufen durch HyperlaktatÃ¤mie oder ErhÃ¶hung derÎ²-HydroxybuttersÃ¤ure, kommt â€” wegen meist mÃ¤ÃŸiger AusprÃ¤gung â€” fÃ¼r die Entwicklung einer hyperurikÃ¤mischen Nephropathie nur geringe Bedeutung zu. AlkoholexzeÃŸ (akut oder chronisch) prÃ¤disponiert zur Rhabdomyolyse mit konsekutivem Nierenversagen. MÃ¶glicherweise ist bei schwerem Alkoholismus und Myopathie die VulnerabilitÃ¤t der Nieren fÃ¼r andere Noxen gesteigert. Bei der Ratte wird das Glyzerin-induzierte akute Nierenversagen durch Alkoholvorbehandlung verstÃ¤rkt.

An ensemble approach to improved prediction from multitype data,"We have developed a strategy for the analysis of newly available binary data to improve outcome predictions based on existing data (binary or non-binary). Our strategy involves two modeling approaches for the newly available data, one combining binary covariate selection via LASSO with logistic regression and one based on logic trees. The results of these models are then compared to the results of a model based on existing data with the objective of combining model results to achieve the most accurate predictions. The combination of model predictions is aided by the use of support vector machines to identify subspaces of the covariate space in which specific models lead to successful predictions. We demonstrate our approach in the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and traditional clinical risk factors for the prediction of coronary heart disease.",2008,arXiv: Applications
Lazy selection: a scribble-based tool for smart shape elements selection,"This paper presents Lazy Selection, a scribble-based tool for quick selection of one or more desired shape elements by roughly stroking through the elements. Our algorithm automatically refines the selection and reveals the user's intention. To give the user maximum flexibility but least ambiguity, our technique first extracts selection candidates from the scribble-covered elements by examining the underlying patterns and then ranks them based on their location and shape with respect to the user-sketched scribble. Such a design makes our tool tolerant to imprecise input systems and applicable to touch systems without suffering from the fat finger problem. A preliminary evaluation shows that compared to the standard click and lasso selection tools, which are the most commonly used, our technique provides significant improvements in efficiency and flexibility for many selection scenarios.",2012,ACM Trans.

Disease cluster detection: a critique and a Bayesian proposal.,"This paper reviews issues in the analysis of non-focussed clustering, and proposes a novel approach to cluster modelling that can be used in a surveillance context. The novel approach involves the use of local likelihood models for the analysis of clustering in small area health data. Local likelihood is used when interdependence between data events at locations is modelled directly, as opposed to the modelling of a hidden process of cluster centres. This approach allows the use of conventional posterior sampling. It also allows a less parameterized approach to the form of clusters detected. The idea of a spatially dependent lasso which provides the local maxima for the aggregation of locations is considered as an approximation. The methods are applied to a well known data set and compared with Satscan, and a conditional logistic Bayesian model.",2006,Statistics in medicine
Sustainable source of omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid from metabolically engineered Yarrowia lipolytica: from fundamental research to commercial production,"The omega-3 fatty acids, cis-5, 8, 11, 14, and 17-eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5; EPA) and cis-4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19-docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6; DHA), have wide-ranging benefits in improving heart health, immune function, mental health, and infant cognitive development. Currently, the major source for EPA and DHA is from fish oil, and a minor source of DHA is from microalgae. With the increased demand for EPA and DHA, DuPont has developed a clean and sustainable source of the omega-3 fatty acid EPA through fermentation using metabolically engineered strains of Yarrowia lipolytica. In this mini-review, we will focus on DuPontâ€™s technology for EPA production. Specifically, EPA biosynthetic and supporting pathways have been introduced into the oleaginous yeast to synthesize and accumulate EPA under fermentation conditions. This Yarrowia platform can also produce tailored omega-3 (EPA, DHA) and/or omega-6 (ARA, GLA) fatty acid mixtures in the cellular lipid profiles. Fundamental research such as metabolic engineering for strain construction, high-throughput screening for strain selection, fermentation process development, and process scale-up were all needed to achieve the high levels of EPA titer, rate, and yield required for commercial application. Here, we summarize how we have combined the fundamental bioscience and the industrial engineering skills to achieve large-scale production of Yarrowia biomass containing high amounts of EPA, which led to two commercial products, New Harvestâ„¢ EPA oil and VerlassoÂ® salmon.",2014,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology
Identification of clinically relevant features in hypertensive patients using penalized regression: a case study of cardiovascular events,"Appropriate management of hypertensive patients relies on the accurate identification of clinically relevant features. However, traditional statistical methods may ignore important information in datasets or overlook possible interactions among features. Machine learning may improve the prediction accuracy and interpretability of regression models by identifying the most relevant features in hypertensive patients. We sought the most relevant features for prediction of cardiovascular (CV) events in a hypertensive population. We used the penalized regression models least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and elastic net (EN) to obtain the most parsimonious and accurate models. The clinical parameters and laboratory biomarkers were collected from the clinical records of 1,471 patients receiving care at Mostoles University Hospital. The outcome was the development of major adverse CV events. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed alone and with penalized regression analyses (LASSO and EN), producing three models. The modeling was performed using 10-fold cross-validation to fit the penalized models. The three predictive models were compared and statistically analyzed to assess their classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, discriminative power, and calibration accuracy. The standard Cox model identified five relevant features, while LASSO and EN identified only three (age, LDL cholesterol, and kidney function). The accuracies of the models (prediction vs. observation) were 0.767 (Cox model), 0.754 (LASSO), and 0.764 (EN), and the areas under the curve were 0.694, 0.670, and 0.673, respectively. However, pairwise comparison of performance yielded no statistically significant differences. All three calibration curves showed close agreement between the predicted and observed probabilities of the development of a CV event. Although the performance was similar for all three models, both penalized regression analyses produced models with good fit and fewer features than the Cox regression predictive model but with the same accuracy. This case study of predictive models using penalized regression analyses shows that penalized regularization techniques can provide predictive models for CV risk assessment that are parsimonious, highly interpretable, and generalizable and that have good fit. For clinicians, a parsimonious model can be useful where available data are limited, as such a model can offer a simple but efficient way to model the impact of the different features on the prediction of CV events. Management of these features may lower the risk for a CV event. Graphical Abstract In a clinical setting, with numerous biological and laboratory features and incomplete datasets, traditional statistical methods may ignore important information and overlook possible interactions among features. Our aim was to identify the most relevant features to predict cardiovascular events in a hypertensive population, using three different regression approaches for feature selection, to improve the prediction accuracy and interpretability of regression models by identifying the relevant features in these patients.

Integrating full spectrum of sequence features into predicting functional microRNA-mRNA interactions,"MOTIVATION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in general biological processes and diseases pathogenesis. Identifying miRNA target genes is an essential step to fully understand the regulatory effects of miRNAs. Many computational methods based on the sequence complementary rules and the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles have been developed for this purpose. It is noted that there have been many sequence features of miRNA targets available, including the context features of the target sites, the thermodynamic stability and the accessibility energy for miRNA-mRNA interaction. However, most of current computational methods that combine sequence and expression information do not effectively integrate full spectrum of these features; instead, they perceive putative miRNA-mRNA interactions from sequence-based prediction as equally meaningful. Therefore, these sequence features have not been fully utilized for improving miRNA target prediction.


RESULTS
We propose a novel regularized regression approach that is based on the adaptive Lasso procedure for detecting functional miRNA-mRNA interactions. Our method fully takes into account the gene sequence features and the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles. Given a set of sequence features for each putative miRNA-mRNA interaction and their expression values, our model quantifies the down-regulation effect of each miRNA on its targets while simultaneously estimating the contribution of each sequence feature to predicting functional miRNA-mRNA interactions. By applying our model to the expression datasets from two cancer studies, we have demonstrated our prediction results have achieved better sensitivity and specificity and are more biologically meaningful compared with those based on other methods.

The acquisition of axioms for ontology learning using named entities,"Domain ontologies facilitate the organization, sharing, and reuse of domain knowledge. The construction of ontologies from text deals with the extraction of concepts and relations from text collection. A huge challenge is the learning of more expressive ontologies which includes relations such as disjointness or equivalence between classes. In our work, we exploit a text collection written in English with occurrence of named entities giving information about individuals in an specific domain knowledge for generating axioms. The co-ocurrence in texts of named entities is exploited to establish axiomatic relations between classes such as subClassOf, disjointWith, and equivalentClass; as well as between individuals as sameIndividualAs and differentFrom by using the instanceOf relation. For this purpose, a Named Entity Recognition tool was used for the identification of instanceOf relation, the linguistic context where the classes co-occur was extracted for the identification of axioms. The experiments were made on a text collection about the tourist domain. The results show that named entities provide good evidence for the identification of axiomatic relations.",2016,IEEE Latin America Transactions
Estimating detection efficiency in the absence of satellites: ENTLN detection efficiency in 2015 and 2016,"To estimate the detection efficiency of a ground based lightning location system, typically the ground based locations are compared to those seen by satellite. This works well because the detection efficiency of the satellite is relatively uniform with space, and reasonably good. However, this technique does not work for the 2015 or 2016 calendar years because the LIS satellite used is no longer in orbit, and has only recently been replaced by ISS-LIS. In this study, we will investigate applying a machine learning regression algorithm Lasso to lightning parameters determined by ENTLN to see if it is possible to estimate the detection efficiency of the network without satellite data.",2017,2017 International Symposium on Lightning Protection (XIV SIPDA)
Comments on: â„“1-penalization for mixture regression models,"We would like to wholeheartedly congratulate Professors Stadler, Buhlmann and van de Geer for an interesting and important paper on developing the L1 regularization theory and methodology in finite mixture regression (FMR) models. An innovated reparametrization scheme is introduced to ensure equivariance under affine transformations and enhance the performance. Some nonasymptotic oracle inequalities on the average excess risk of the Lasso-type estimator are established in high dimensions, where the number of covariates can be much larger than the sample size. The authors also introduce an efficient EM-type algorithm combined with an improved coordinate descent for implementation. We appreciate the opportunity to comment on several aspects of this paper.",2010,TEST
Electricity Price Forecasting using Sale and Purchase Curves: The X-Model,"Our paper aims to model and forecast the electricity price by taking a completely new perspective on the data. It will be the first approach which is able to combine the insights of market structure models with extensive and modern econometric analysis. Instead of directly modeling the electricity price as it is usually done in time series or data mining approaches, we model and utilize its true source: the sale and purchase curves of the electricity exchange. We will refer to this new model as X-Model, as almost every deregulated electricity price is simply the result of the intersection of the electricity supply and demand curve at a certain auction. Therefore we show an approach to deal with a tremendous amount of auction data, using a subtle data processing technique as well as dimension reduction and lasso based estimation methods. We incorporate not only several known features, such as seasonal behavior or the impact of other processes like renewable energy, but also completely new elaborated stylized facts of the bidding structure. Our model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of the electricity price, which is especially useful for predicting huge price spikes. Using simulation methods we show how to derive prediction intervals for probabilistic forecasting. We describe and show the proposed methods for the day-ahead EPEX spot price of Germany and Austria.",2015,Energy Economics
Evaluating Loop Heat Pipe Performance Improvement Using Circumferential Grooves,"The loop heat pipe (LHP) technology development has to deal with the growing need of high heat flux dissipation and several issues related to space qualification and integration, along with the miniaturization of this device. As some design limitations are faced related to the maximum heat flux able to be managed by LHPs, improvements on their capillary evaporator design can result on a gain on its capability of heat management along with a substantial decrease on the heat source temperature, which is very desirable, as well as the use of alternative working fluids. Thus, this work presents an investigation of LHPs that operate with acetone as working fluid, for maximum operational heat loads of 80 W, where the results of life tests performed in laboratory conditions are presented. Two identical LHPs were designed and tested, where one presents the classic design of a capillary evaporator primary wick with axial grooves, while the other presents the design of circumferential grooves. For the same active length, there has been a gain of 20% on the contact area when using circumferential grooves on the primary wick, resulting in better thermal performance. Upon operating at its maximum designed heat load, the heat source temperature for the evaporator with a primary wick with circumferential grooves shows temperatures up to 50% lower then when using the one with axial grooves, which is a major gain on the overall LHP performance. Loop Heat Pipe Design Considerations The development of the loop heat pipe (LHP) technology for specific space applications has resulted in great advances regarding the design of capillary evaporators able to promote the heat management at lower heat source temperatures. As informations regarding the capillary evaporator design and optimization is not easily available, some features have to be implemented and tested in order to verify whether they will give the required results. One of the most used configuration in capillary evaporators with an integral compensation chamber (CC) applies axial grooves on the primary wick outer diameter. Depending on the design of the primary wick a certain number of grooves can be implemented in order to result in a better thermal performance for the LHP. Several authors have reported this kind of primary wick configuration and how reliable the thermal behavior in LHPs can be achieved (Delil et al., 2003; Ku and Rodriguez, 2003; Riehl, 2004; Maydanik, 2005, Vlassov and Riehl, 2005). However, details on the primary wick exact geometry and features are rare as this represents the most important component of the capillary evaporator itself. Other characteristics on the evaporator design are also important, such as the secondary wick geometry and the internal surface of the capillary evaporator. In this case, micro-machining of the internal surface of the evaporator can promote a better heat transfer capability to this device. The secondary wick, being a challenging component to be simulated in order to obtain the correct influence of this part on the entire LHP behavior, also requires an special design as presented by Ku et al. (2001) when an arterial secondary wick was applied. Even though great advances on the development of LHPs have been observed during the last decade, the design of those devices still rely on the designer experience. With the continuous development of the LHP technology performed in this institute, geometric features were applied to the capillary evaporator design in order to obtain a better thermal performance. Some geometric changes were applied in order to compared the results with classical capillary evaporator design. The features applied are related to circumferential grooves machined on the primary wick outer diameter, as well as microgrooves on the evaporator inner diameter and a secondary wick made of stainless steel screen mesh with arterial grooves. The results gathered with this new capillary evaporator design implemented in a LHP were compared to the results previously presented for another LHP that has axial grooves machined on the primary wick outer diameter (Riehl and Siqueira, 2005). Extensive life tests using this new geometry were performed for a LHP using acetone as the working fluid with an interest in qualifying this fluid for future space applications. Thus, this paper presents the performance improvement achieved with this new capillary evaporator design, as well as presents the comparison with previous results related to the life tests of another LHP. Improvement on the Capillary Evaporator Design The most used internal configuration for capillary evaporators for both loop heat pipes and capillary pumped loops presents axial grooves machined on the primary wick outer surface. In this case, the groove geometry must be able to give a reliable operation to the device, collecting the vapour properly and not presenting localized dryout. However, depending on the primary wick outer diameter, it is not possible to make the required grooves and, sometimes, capillary evaporators with axial grooves can present a thermal behaviour that is not in agreement to what has been expected. Such a behaviour was found on a previous design named TCD-LHP2 where axial grooves were machine on the primary wick outer diameter. Even though the device would present a reliable operation, the capillary evaporator and operation temperatures were very close to the limit imposed by the project (Riehl and Siqueira, 2005 and 2006). As a better thermal performance was necessary, some modifications on the internal geometry of the capillary evaporator were performed for this new device that has been under life tests in laboratory conditions, named here as TCD-LHP3. The capillary evaporator for this LHP presents the following features: primary wick with circumferential grooves machined on its outer surface with a single axial groove for vapour collection, microgrooves machined on the evaporator inner diameter and arteries made on the secondary wick structure. Differently from the TCD-LHP2 capillary evaporator design, which presented around 1,500 microgrooves per meter, the new design, here called as TCD-LHP3, was considerably improved as it presents around 2,500 microgrooves per meter (0.2 mm wide, 0.2 mm in depth). This change was considered necessary after some calculations in order to improve the heat transfer mechanism between the evaporator housing and the saturated working fluid. However, the most important change made on the TCD-LHP3 capillary evaporator was related to its primary and secondary wick structures. Even though the arteries of the secondary wick and micro-grooves on the evaporator inner surface seem to increase the thermal performance of the LHP, the circumferential grooves were found to highly contribute to this improvement. The geometry with circumferential grooves machined on the wickâ€™s outer surface and only one axial groove responsible for the vapor collection was simulated and implemented in the capillary evaporator design. The characteristics of the circumferential grooves were also changed in order to accommodate a more effective geometry, which was proved to show better thermal behavior during the simulations (Riehl, 2002; Vlassov and Riehl, 2006). The machining process was much easier with the circumferential grooves as well as the wickâ€™s insertion in the evaporator housing. With this new geometry, more grooves and greater contact area between the wick and the evaporator housing were achieved for the same active length used with the TCD-LHP2 design as well. Figure 1a presents the circumferential grooves machined on a UHMW polyethylene and sintered nickel. It is very important to point that after the machining process to make the grooves, the wick structures were verified in microscope to certify that the pores were not closed. Figure 1b shows the arteries made on the secondary wick structure.",2006,
Forecasting crude oil prices with a large set of predictors: Can LASSO select powerful predictors?,"Abstract In this paper, we use two prevailing shrinkage methods, the lasso and elastic net, to predict oil price returns with a large set of predictors. The out-of-sample results indicate that the lasso and elastic net models outperform a host of widely used competing models in terms of out-of-sample R-square and success ratio. In an asset allocation exercise, a meanâ€“variance investor obtains positive and sizeable economic gains based on the return forecasts of the lasso and elastic net methods relative to both the benchmark forecasts and competing forecasts. We further investigate the source of predictability from a variable selection perspective. The lasso and elastic net methods are found to select powerful predictors and the ones that can provide complementary information. The OLS regression models based on the selected predictors also exhibit better out-of-sample performances than the competing models. In addition, our results are robust to various settings.",2019,Journal of Empirical Finance
Adaptively Thresholded Lasso for Gene Regulatory Networks 3 standard techniques for analysis of VAR models,"Discovering regulatory interactions from time course gene expression data constitutes a canonical problem in functional genomics and systems biology. The framework of graphical Granger causality allows one to estimate such causal relationships from these data. In this study, we propose an adaptively thresholding estimates of Granger causal effects obtained from the lasso penalization method. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed technique, and discuss the advantages it offers over competing methods, such as the truncating lasso. Its performance and that of its competitors is assessed on a number of simulated settings and it is applied on a data set that captures the activation of T-cells.",2011,
Lasso-type recovery of sparse representations for high-dimensional data,"The Lasso [28] is an attractive technique for regularization and variable selection for high-dimensional data, where the number of predictor variables p is potentially much larger than the number of samples n. However, it was recently discovered [23, 38, 39] that the sparsity pattern of the Lasso estimator can only be asymptotically identical to the true sparsity pattern if the design matrix satisfies the so-called irrepresentable condition. The latter condition can easily be violated in applications due to the presence of highly correlated variables. Here we examine the behavior of the Lasso estimators if the irrepresentable condition is relaxed. Even though the Lasso cannot recover the correct sparsity pattern, we show that the estimator is still consistent in the â€˜2-norm sense for fixed designs under conditions on (a) the number sn of non-zero components of the vector n and (b) the minimal singular values of the design matrices that are induced by selecting of order sn variables. The results are extended to vectors in weak â€˜q-balls with 0 < q < 1.

Indiaâ€™s Mid-day Meal Program and Schooling: an Evaluation Based on Machine Learning,"Using state-level data on Indiaâ€™s Mid-Day Meal program (school lunch program for children) we scrutinize if funds disbursed and food-grains supplied for the purpose can actually serve as good determinants of number of children covered (fed) by the scheme (our dependent variable). Our standard regression studies find that the effect of food-grain supplied has statistically significant effect on the dependent variable while the marginal effects of funds/money disbursed is not statistically significant. Using LASSO based Machine Learning techniques and after controlling for several correlated variables and state level factors we find that both policy variables - funds and food-grains however act as good out-of-sample predictors of number of children being covered. Evaluation of out-of-sample prediction performance of regression models and covariates is a very important but mostly an uncharted territory in development economics. Note that funds are used partly to provide fixed costs of the food service provided, and therefore it is not surprising that the coefficient estimate of this covariate (i.e., its marginal effect on dependent variable) does not appear to be statistically significant; but it can still act as a good overall predictor for our dependent variable.",2018,Applied Econometrics and International Development

Computing the Density Matrix in Electronic Structure Theory on Graphics Processing Units.,"The self-consistent solution of a SchrÃ¶dinger-like equation for the density matrix is a critical and computationally demanding step in quantum-based models of interatomic bonding. This step was tackled historically via the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. We have investigated the performance and accuracy of the second-order spectral projection (SP2) algorithm for the computation of the density matrix via a recursive expansion of the Fermi operator in a series of generalized matrix-matrix multiplications. We demonstrate that owing to its simplicity, the SP2 algorithm [Niklasson, A. M. N. Phys. Rev. B2002, 66, 155115] is exceptionally well suited to implementation on graphics processing units (GPUs). The performance in double and single precision arithmetic of a hybrid GPU/central processing unit (CPU) and full GPU implementation of the SP2 algorithm exceed those of a CPU-only implementation of the SP2 algorithm and traditional matrix diagonalization when the dimensions of the matrices exceed about 2000 Ã— 2000. Padding schemes for arrays allocated in the GPU memory that optimize the performance of the CUBLAS implementations of the level 3 BLAS DGEMM and SGEMM subroutines for generalized matrix-matrix multiplications are described in detail. The analysis of the relative performance of the hybrid CPU/GPU and full GPU implementations indicate that the transfer of arrays between the GPU and CPU constitutes only a small fraction of the total computation time. The errors measured in the self-consistent density matrices computed using the SP2 algorithm are generally smaller than those measured in matrices computed via diagonalization. Furthermore, the errors in the density matrices computed using the SP2 algorithm do not exhibit any dependence of system size, whereas the errors increase linearly with the number of orbitals when diagonalization is employed.",2012,Journal of chemical theory and computation
A Study for the Drivers of Movie Box-office Performance,"This study analyzed the relationship between key film and a box office record success factors based on movies released in the first quarter of 2013 in Korea. An over-fitting problem can happen if there are too many explanatory variables inserted to regression model; in addition, there is a risk that the estimator is instable when there is multi-collinearity among the explanatory variables. For this reason, optimal variable selection based on high explanatory variables in box-office performance is of importance. Among the numerous ways to select variables, LASSO estimation applied by a generalized linear model has the smallest prediction error that can efficiently and quickly find variables with the highest explanatory power to box-office performance in order.",2013,

Smooth Image-on-Scalar Regression for Brain Mapping,"Brain mapping is an emerging tool in neurology and psychiatry researches for the realization of data-driven personalized medicine in the big data era. Taking images as responses, it learns the statistical links between brain images and subject level features. 
It is common practice to denoise the image before conducting any analysis, but at the risk of losing signals on small regions during the smooth stage. In this paper we propose {\it Smooth Image-on-scalar Regression} (SIR), a novel method for recovering the true association between an image outcome and scalar predictors. The estimator is achieved by minimizing a fidelity term plus a total variation (TV) regularization on the predicted mean image across all subjects. The proposed method bears connection to function-on-scalar regression with splines and graph fused lasso problems. We propose a provable convergent algorithm for the parameter estimation, which is efficient and can be easily combined with off-the-shell graph fused lasso solvers. The statistical consistency of the estimator is presented via an oracle inequality. 
Simulation results demonstrate that SIR outperforms existing methods, and is especially effective in recovering signals in heterogeneous region sizes.

Editorial Introduction,"T he following essays are attempts to take seriously Iain Hamilton Grantâ€™s claim in the above passage that â€œSchelling is a contemporary philosopher.â€ Schelling is read in dialogue with key figures in the canon of European philosophy and critical theory (Badiou, ChatÌ‚elet, Deleuze, de Man, Meillassoux, Merleau-Ponty, Simondon, Å½izÄ›k, Malabou), as well as in light of recent trends in analytic philosophy (Brandomian pragmatism, powers-based metaphysics and semantic naturalism) â€“ and such readings are not meant merely to highlight Schellingian influences or resonances in contemporary thinking, but rather to challenge and interrogate current orthodoxies by insisting upon the contemporaneity of Schellingian speculation. To quote Grant once more, â€œSchellingianism is resurgent every time philosophy reaches beyond the Kant-inspired critique of metaphysics, its subjectivist-epistemological transcendentalism, and its isolation of physics from metaphysicsâ€ (5). Speculative philosophy is not dead; it is, in fact, enjoying quite a notorious renaissance â€“ and the rehabilitation of Schellingianism has played a substantive role in this. Two decades ago, F.W.J. Schellingâ€™s name first resurfaced as a resource for contemporary philosophising in Slavoj Å½izÄ›kâ€™s The Indivisible Remainder, and Å½izÄ›kâ€™s strategy of redeploying Schellingian themes for contemporary ends has continued to play a role, more or less subterranean, in the writings of many since (Gabriel, Laruelle, Nancy). However, it was in 2006 with the publication of Grantâ€™s Philosophies of Nature after Schelling that Schelling was most fully revived as a dialogue-partner for contemporary thinking. Grant recapitulates the famous passage from the Freiheitsschrift in which Schelling bemoans the lack of a concept of nature in post-Cartesian philosophies by extending it to all post-Kantian philosophies and even Schelling scholarship itself. Thus, Grant speaks of â€œall post-Cartesian European",2016,Angelaki
Pre-existent left atrial scarring in patients undergoing pulmonary vein antrum isolation: an independent predictor of procedural failure.,"OBJECTIVES
The goal of this study was to assess the impact of left atrial scarring (LAS) on the outcome of patients undergoing pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) for atrial fibrillation (AF).


BACKGROUND
Left atrial scarring may be responsible for both the perpetuation and genesis of AF.


METHODS
A total of 700 consecutive patients undergoing first-time PVAI were studied. Before ablation, extensive voltage mapping of the left atrium (LA) was performed using a multipolar Lasso catheter guided by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). Patients with LAS were defined by a complete absence of electrographic recording by a circular mapping catheter in multiple LA locations, and this was validated by electroanatomic mapping. All four pulmonary vein antra and the superior vena cava were isolated using an ICE-guided technique. Patients were followed at least nine months for late AF recurrence. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the predictive value of LAS and other variables on outcome.


RESULTS
Of 700 patients, 42 had LAS, which represented 21 +/- 11% of the LA surface area by electroanatomic mapping. Patients with LAS had a significantly higher AF recurrence (57%) compared with non-LAS patients (19%, p = 0.003). Also, LAS was associated with a significantly larger LA size, lower ejection fraction, and higher C-reactive protein levels. Univariate analysis revealed age, nonparoxysmal AF, and LAS as predictors of recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed LAS as the only independent predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 9.4; p = 0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
Pre-existent LAS in patients undergoing PVAI for AF is a powerful, independent predictor of procedural failure. Left atrial scarring is associated with a lower EF, larger LA size, and increased inflammatory markers.",2005,Journal of the American College of Cardiology
Enhancing the fundamental limits of sparsity pattern recovery,"Abstract Detecting the sparsity pattern or support set of a sparse vector from a small number of noisy linear measurements is a challenging problem in compressed sensing. This paper considers the problem of support recovery when statistical side information is available. From the standard linear and noisy measurement model with arbitrary sensing matrix and Gaussian additive noise and by exploiting the side information, a new linear model is derived which benefits from a larger sample size. The common potential benefits of the increase in the number of samples are revealed. The stability guarantees are then analyzed based on the new model. Two decoding schemes are taken for the support recovery task from the new framework, namely, Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Joint-Typicality (JT) decoding. Performance bounds of the support recovery from the new framework are developed and upper bounds are derived on the error probability of these decoders when they are fed with the prior knowledge which is the statistical properties of the new measurement noise. Finally, an extension is provided for when the noise is non-Gaussian. The results show that with the aid of the prior knowledge and using the new framework one can push the performance limits of the sparsity pattern recovery significantly. The approach is supported by extensive simulations including extension of LASSO to the new framework.",2017,Digit. Signal Process.
Variable selection in heterogeneous datasets: A truncated-rank sparse linear mixed model with applications to genome-wide association studies,"A fundamental and important challenge in modern datasets of ever increasing dimensionality is variable selection, which has taken on renewed interest recently due to the growth of biological and medical datasets with complex, non-i.i.d. structures. NaÃ¯vely applying classical variable selection methods such as the Lasso to such datasets may lead to a large number of false discoveries. Motivated by genome-wide association studies in genetics, we study the problem of variable selection for datasets arising from multiple subpopulations, when this underlying population structure is unknown to the researcher. We propose a unified framework for sparse variable selection that adaptively corrects for population structure via a low-rank linear mixed model. Most importantly, the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of individual relationships in the data and adaptively selects a covariance structure of the correct complexity. Through extensive experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of this framework over existing methods. Further, we test our method on three different genomic datasets from plants, mice, and humans, and discuss the knowledge we discover with our model.",2017,Proceedings.

Dangers of doing right things in a wrong place.,"This story began in 2006, when Iain Chalmers, discussing the obligation of authors of systematic reviews to detect plagiarism, used the example of plagiarizer Asim Kurjak from Croatia.1 Journal editors who were confronted with plagiarism developed methods of handling cases of plagiarism years ago, and more general regulations in relation to research misconduct were prepared.2 In the Croatian case, some journals did what they ought to do: the Croatian Medical Journal (CMJ) checked all publications by A. Kurjak, found duplicate publications and marked them as retracted in MEDLINE. Now of 252 publications by A. Kurjak as they appear in MEDLINE only 2 articles retracted by CMJ are marked as â€˜retractedâ€™. It is the visible tip of an iceberg of plagiarism.

Implications of genomic selection for obtaining F2:3 families of tomato,"Abstract Selection plays an important role into breeding programs since it increases the population genotypic mean for a trait. In tomato, the generation and evaluation of large populations is an activity carried out by the breeder which produces increases in cost and time. The objective of this research was to compare the accuracy of phenotypic and marker-based selection for six traits related to fruit in a segregating population as well as to study the performance of several models of genomic selection. Results of the evaluation of six quantitative traits indicated that the prediction accuracies using ridge regression and Bayesian LASSO were greater in comparison to that obtained by multiple linear regression for the situations proposed. During the selection of the best genotypes at both F2 and F3 generations, in general, the phenotypic selection had higher genetic gains than those obtained by the strategies based on genomic selection and marker assisted selection.",2016,Scientia Horticulturae
Incorporating Prior Knowledge into Regularized Regression,"Motivation Associated with genomic features like gene expression, methylation, and genotypes, used in statistical modeling of health outcomes, there is a rich set of meta-features like functional annotations, pathway information, and knowledge from previous studies, that can be used post-hoc to facilitate the interpretation of a model. However, using this meta-feature information a-priori rather than post-hoc can yield improved prediction performance as well as enhanced model interpretation. Results We propose a new penalized regression approach that allows a-priori integration of external meta-features. The method extends LASSO regression by incorporating individualized penalty parameters for each regression coefficient. The penalty parameters are in turn modeled as a log-linear function of the meta-features and are estimated from the data using an approximate empirical Bayes approach. Optimization of the marginal likelihood on which the empirical Bayes estimation is based is performed using a fast and stable majorization-minimization procedure. Through simulations, we show that the proposed regression with individualized penalties can outperform the standard LASSO in terms of both parameters estimation and prediction performance when the external data is informative. We further demonstrate our approach with applications to gene expression studies of bone density and breast cancer.

Techniques on semiautomatic segmentation using the Adobe Photoshop,"The purpose of this research is to enable anybody to semiautomatically segment the anatomical structures in the MRIs, CTs, and other medical images on the personal computer. The segmented images are used for making 3D images, which are helpful in medical education and research. To achieve this purpose, the following trials were performed. The entire body of a volunteer was scanned to make 557 MRIs. On Adobe Photoshop, contours of 19 anatomical structures in the MRIs were semiautomatically drawn using MAGNETIC LASSO TOOL and manually corrected using either LASSO TOOL or DIRECT SELECTION TOOL to make 557 segmented images. In a likewise manner, 13 anatomical structures in the 8,590 anatomical images were segmented. Also 12 anatomical structures in the 790 brain anatomical images and 10 anatomical structures in the 640 heart anatomical images were segmented. Proper segmentation was verified by making 3D images from the segmented images. The semiautomatic segmentation using Adobe Photoshop is expected to be widely used for segmentation of the anatomical structures in various medical images.",2005,"Proceedings of 7th International Workshop on Enterprise networking and Computing in Healthcare Industry, 2005.

Regression and independence based variable importance measure,"Abstract Evaluating the importance of input (predictor) variables is of interest in many applications of statistical models. However, nonlinearity and correlation among variables make it difficult to measure variable importance accurately. In this work, a novel variable importance measure, called regression and independence based variable importance (RIVI), is proposed. RIVI is designed by integrating Gaussian process regression (GPR) and Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) so that it is applicable to nonlinear systems. The results of two numerical examples demonstrate that RIVI is superior to several conventional measures including the Pearson correlation coefficient, PLS-Î², PLS-VIP, Lasso, HSIC, and permutation importance with random forest in the variable identification accuracy.",2020,Comput.

Sparsity by Worst-Case Penalties,"This paper proposes a new interpretation of sparse penalties such as the elastic-net and the group-lasso. Beyond providing a new viewpoint on these penalization schemes, our approach results in a unified optimization strategy. Our experiments demonstrate that this strategy, implemented on the elastic-net, is computationally extremely efficient for small to medium size problems. Our accompanying software solves problems very accurately, at machine precision, in the time required to get a rough estimate with competing state-of-the-art algorithms. We illustrate on real and artificial datasets that this accuracy is required to for the correctness of the support of the solution, which is an important element for the interpretability of sparsity-inducing penalties.",2012,arXiv: Machine Learning
Graph classification based on sparse graph feature selection and extreme learning machine,"Identification and classification of graph data is a hot research issue in pattern recognition. The conventional methods of graph classification usually convert the graph data to the vector representation and then using SVM to be a classifier. These methods ignore the sparsity of graph data, and with the increase of the input sample, the storage and computation of the kernel matrix will cost a lot of memory and time. In this paper, we propose a new graph classification algorithm called graph classification based on sparse graph feature selection and extreme learning machine. The key of our method is using the lasso to select features because of the sparsity of graph data, and extreme learning machine(ELM) is introduced to the following classification task due to its good performance. Extensive experimental results on a series of benchmark graph data sets validate the eff ectiveness of the proposed methods.",2017,Neurocomputing

We derive theoretical results establishing various types of consistency. In particular, we derive conditions under which the Lasso estimator for the autoregressive coefficients is model selection consistent, estimation consistent and prediction consistent.

Standardized phenotyping: advantages to horticulture - introduction to the workshop.,"New and emerging DNA sequencing technologies have recently accelerated the pace of gene discovery. Phenotypes are the expression of genotypes and reveal gene function. As such, phenotypes provide the crucial link between sequence variation and biological function. As a result of the relative ease in obtaining vast quantities of genomic data, phenotypic information is not keeping pace with the explosion in available genomic information. The lack of reliable and available phenotypic data may limit the use of statistical methods to identify the associations between phenotypic and genotypic (or genomic) data, thus hindering our understanding of the genetic basis of biological processes. Sequence data reveal high levels of genomic syntenies that suggest conservation of gene order, content, and function among phylogenetically related groups. Although it is possible to assign putative gene function based on reported function in other plants and, in some instances, other organisms, inferences should be validated by experimental genetic analysis. Only approximately two-thirds of genes have an assigned biochemical function and a small percentage of these genes are associated with a phenotype (Bochner, 2003). This â€˜â€˜phenotype gap,â€™â€™ first described in mouse research (Brown and Peters, 1996), is a major challenge in biological understanding of plant processes and translational genomics. This gap must be filled by developing a coordinated effort to standardize phenotyping protocols across personnel, seasons, regions, and institutions and apply uniform phenotypic nomenclature to facilitate database searches, comparisons, and extrapolations. Standardized phenotypic protocols are the prerequisite for the production of a so-called â€˜â€˜phenomic mapâ€™â€™ in which every identified gene is defined by at least one phenotype. Such a system of comparative phenomics would facilitate the progression of knowledge throughout model biological systems in plants and from other well-studied organisms. As research projects become more nationally and internationally integrated, the need for standardized data collection and documentation has grown. We highlight several projects and germplasm centers that have recognized the need for developing standardized phenotyping protocols and the associated nomenclature, annotation, and databases for enabling comparative phenomics. This workshop on standardized phenotyping and the advantages it provides for horticultural crops was held at the 2009 American Society for Horticultural Science Annual Conference in St. Louis, MO, and was organized by the Genetics and Germplasm Working Group. The objectives of the workshop were to 1) describe phenotyping efforts in diverse horticultural disciplines; 2) relate advantages for using standardized phenotyping for broad applicability in research and breeding programs; 3) emphasize the importance of standardization for genomics applications; and 4) give an update on standardized ontology for horticultural crops. Each of the five presentations was recorded and has been made available at http://www.ashs.org/db/horttalks/ listing2.lasso. The five presentations include examples, advantages, constraints, and recommendations of/for the use standardized phenotyping in horticulture. The first speaker, Joseph Postman, related how â€˜â€˜Standardized plant disease evaluations will enhance resistance gene discovery.â€™â€™ He emphasized the value of using standardized numerical ratings and reference cultivars to record resistant and tolerant individuals. Jay Scott in â€˜â€˜Phenotyping of tomato for SolCAP and onward into the voidâ€™â€™ and Jim Luby (for Cameron Peace and coworkers) in â€˜â€˜Standardized phenotyping of apple texture for improved breeding and research efficiencyâ€™â€™ spoke of ongoing funded research programs in Solanaceae and Rosaceae, respectively, that have sought to use standardized recording methods across laboratories and locations to document germplasm performance. David Rudell presented â€˜â€˜Standardized postharvest quality and biochemical phenotyping for precise population comparisonâ€™â€™ and described the value of standardization when documenting postharvest quality attributes in fruit in a quantitative manner. Gayle Volk concluded the workshop with a presentation â€˜â€˜Advantages for the use of standardized phenotyping in the National Plant Germplasm Systemâ€™â€™ that stressed the advantages and benefits for programs that overcome the difficulties involved in standardization, including examples from both the mammalian and plant systems.

Morphological and Genetic Characterization of the First Species of Thalassodrilides (Annelida: Clitellata: Naididae: Limnodriloidinae) from Japan,"A species of marine limnodriloidine oligochaete, Thalassodrilides cf. briani

The present material agrees with the original description of T. briani, which was first found at Hong Kong, with the exception that the copulatory sacs are oval; not slender. Despite the lack of genetic data for the Hong Kong population, we conclude that the Japanese specimens are conspecific with it, or at least very closely related, based on morphological considerations. This is the first record of the genus Thalassodrilides

in Japan. The phylogenetic relationships between T. cf. briani and three other species of Thalassodrilides are estimated, based on partial DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and the complete nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region, using two members of the closely related genus Doliodrilus Erseus, 1984 as outgroups. The genetic analysis shows that T. cf. briani is a species delimited by both mitochondrial and nuclear data, and clearly separated from at least its closely related congeners in the Northwest Atlantic (Caribbean and adjacent areas).",2016,
Shifts in gut microbiome and metabolome are associated with risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation,"Specific alterations of gut microbiota (GM) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, including elevated microbial diversity, particularly perturbed composition, imbalanced microbial function, and associated metabolic pattern modifications have been described in our previous report. The current work aimed to assess the association of GM composition with AF recurrence (RAF) after ablation, and to construct a GM-based predictive model for RAF. Gut microbial composition and metabolic profiles were assessed based on metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic analyses. Compared with non-AF controls (50 individuals), GM composition and metabolomic profile were significantly altered between patients with recurrent AF (17 individuals) and the non-RAF group (23 individuals). Notably, discriminative taxa between the non-RAF and RAF groups, including the families Nitrosomonadaceae and Lentisphaeraceae, the genera Marinitoga and Rufibacter, and the species Faecalibacterium sp. CAG:82, Bacillus gobiensis, and Desulfobacterales bacterium PC51MH44, were selected to construct a taxonomic scoring system based on LASSO analysis. An elevated area under curve (0.954) and positive net reclassification index (1.5601) for predicting RAF compared with traditional clinical scoring (AUC=0.6918) were obtained. The GM-based taxonomic scoring system theoretically improves the model performance. These data provide novel evidence that supports incorporating the GM factor into future recurrent risk stratification.",2020,bioRxiv
Contest For Seascape: Local Thalassocracies and Sino-Indian Trade Expansion in the Maritime Southeast Asia During the Early Premodern Period,"The focus of this paper is to examine the response of local thalassocracies during the expansion of Indian and Chinese trade to maritime Southeast Asia during the transitional era between the end of the ancient and the beginning of the premodern period, with the particular focus on the contesting seascape among local the emporiums. This study is significant to be conducted since the role of local initiatives in international maritime trade during the early maritime relations between India and China is still not widely known. The historical narrative on the part of Southeast Asian people in the maritime trade relations between India and China is still vague. For this purpose, this article will address some of the issues related to the role of local emporium in the contexts of the expansion of the two giants, India and China, to the Southeast Asian maritime world and how sea space contestation occurred not only between India and China but also among local powers that wanted to control international maritime trade relations between India and China.",2018,Journal of Marine and Island Cultures
Measurement error in Lasso: Impact and likelihood bias correction,"Regression with the lasso penalty is a popular tool for performing dimension reduction when the number of covariates is large. In many applications of the lasso, like in genomics, covariates are subject to measurement error. We study the impact of measurement error on linear regression with the lasso penalty, both analytically and in simulation experiments. A simple method of correction for measurement error in the lasso is then considered. In the large sample limit, the corrected lasso yields sign consistent covariate selection under conditions very similar to the lasso with perfect measurements, whereas the uncorrected lasso requires much more stringent conditions on the covariance structure of the data. Finally, we suggest methods to correct for measurement error in generalized linear models with the lasso penalty, which we study empirically in simulation experiments with logistic regression, and also apply to a classification problem with microarray data. We see that the corrected lasso selects less false positives than the standard lasso, at a similar level of true positives. The corrected lasso can therefore be used to obtain more conservative covariate selection in genomic analysis.",2015,Statistica Sinica
"Sewage pollution and the infaunal benthos of Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong","Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong, receives 800 million litres Â· dayâˆ’1 of untreated sewage from 3.6 million people, but is flushed by tidal currents at velocities up to 1.1 m Â· sâˆ’1. Two replicate Smith-McIntyre grab samples were collected at 66 stations in August 1979, yielding a total of 5797 animals belonging to 68 species. Agglomerative hierarchical classification was used to delineate five station groups; a sixth group contained four stations where no fauna were found. All but one of the groups inhabited fine sediments (> 70% silt-clay) and could be placed along a gradient conforming to the typical pattern of organic pollution effects found in boreal and temperate waters. Abiotic areas, found in enclosed typhoon shelters, were successively replaced by a very poor fauna, a peak of opportunists, an ecotone point and a transition to normal fauna. The peak of opportunists was dominated by the oligochaete Thalassodrilides gurwitschi (Hrabe); the polychaetes Capitella capitata (Fabricius) and Minuspio cirrifera (Wiren) were also numerous. Overall abundance was low (784 individuals Â· mâˆ’2) compared with opportunists in boreal and temperate waters. The remaining station group was found in coarser sediments (<40% silt-clay) and an inflexion was observed in the log-normal distribution of individuals per species. Dominant species included the bivalve Tapes philippinarum (Adams & Reeve) and the polychaete Minuspio cirrifera; overall abundance was high (1103 individuals Â· mâˆ’2). In general, pollution was assessed by the pattern of changes in number of species, abundance, biomass, diversity and evenness, by log-normal distributions of individuals per species, and by the indicator species M. cirrifera. When compared with earlier (1976) data, community conditions were generally similar but the abundance of individual species varied greatly and M. cirrifera was absent. The severely polluted area was â‰ˆ 15 km2; this is similar in extent to offshore discharge sites and indicates the importance of tidal flushing in this inshore channel.",1983,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology
Os primeiros vestÃ­gios da esportivizaÃ§Ã£o das prÃ¡ticas equestres em Porto Alegre,"O presente estudo tem por objetivo compreender como as praticas equestres incorporaram elementos de esportivizacao, em Porto Alegre, entre meados do seculo XIX e o inicio do seculo XX. Para tanto, as praticas equestres foram tratadas como praticas culturais que produzem representacoes; assim, para a realizacao desta pesquisa historica, foram analisadas informacoes coletadas em jornais e revistas porto-alegrenses que circulavam no periodo, como o Almanaque Esportivo do Rio Grande do Sul, a Revista Sportiva, a Revista do Globo, o Correio do Povo e a Gazeta de Porto Alegre.

O cavalo, para a identidade do sul-rio-grandense, representa um de seus simbolos, uma vez que sempre se associaram, ao longo da historia do Rio Grande do Sul. A parceria entre homem e animal esta presente, tambem, nos momentos de lazer e diversao. As fontes revelaram que, no contexto predominantemente rural, em Porto Alegre, na segunda metade do seculo XIX, emergiram as primeiras praticas equestres com elementos de esportivizacao. Neste periodo, ja ocorriam, na cidade, praticas esportivas com a participacao do cavalo, como, por exemplo, as â€œcarreiras em cancha retaâ€, o turfe, e as touradas. Dentre estas, destacam-se o turfe como exemplo de praticas equestres que desenvolveram propriedades caracteristicas de esporte moderno. Outras praticas equestres, relacionadas com a raca equina crioula, procuravam reproduzir o trabalho campeiro dos pampas sul-rio-grandenses, o qual ocorria ja desde o seculo XVI. Algumas destas praticas sao: o Freio de Ouro, o Tiro de Laco e o Crioulaco, as quais tambem despontavam elementos de esportivizacao.(AU) This study aims to understand how equestrian practices have incorporated sportivization elements, in Porto Alegre, between the mid-nineteenth century and the early twentieth century. For that, equestrian practices were treated as cultural practices producing representations; thus, to accomplish this historical research, information collected from newspapers and magazines that circulated in Porto Alegre in the period were analyzed, such as the Sports Almanac of Rio Grande do Sul, Sportiva Magazine, Globo Magazine, Correio do Povo and Gazeta de Porto Alegre. Equestrian practices are cultural practices that are historically related with the the sociocultural setting configuration of Porto Alegre. The horse, for the identity of Rio Grande do Sul, is one of its symbols, since they have been always associated, throughout its history. The partnership between man and animal is also present in moments of relaxation and enjoyment. Sources revealed that within the predominantly rural context, in Porto Alegre, in the second half of the nineteenth century, the first equestrian practices with sportivization elements emerged. In this period, in the city, sports practices involving the horse were already occuring, for example, â€œstraight line horse racesâ€, turf, and bullfighting. Among these, we highlight turf as an example of an equestrian practice that has developed features properties of a modern sport. Other equestrian practices, related to the equine breed Crioulo, sought to reproduce the field work of Rio Grande do Sulâ€™s pampas, which have occurred since the sixteenth century. Some of these practices are: the Golden Bridle, the shot of Lasso with Horse and the shot of Lasso with Crioulo Horse, which also sprouted sportivization elements.(AU)",2014,
Association between biomarkers and clinical characteristics in chronic subdural hematoma patients assessed with lasso regression,"Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is characterized by an ""old"" encapsulated collection of blood and blood breakdown products between the brain and its outermost covering (the dura). Recognized risk factors for development of CSDH are head injury, old age and using anticoagulation medication, but its underlying pathophysiological processes are still unclear. It is assumed that a complex local process of interrelated mechanisms including inflammation, neomembrane formation, angiogenesis and fibrinolysis could be related to its development and propagation. However, the association between the biomarkers of inflammation and angiogenesis, and the clinical and radiological characteristics of CSDH patients, need further investigation. The high number of biomarkers compared to the number of observations, the correlation between biomarkers, missing data and skewed distributions may limit the usefulness of classical statistical methods. We therefore explored lasso regression to assess the association between 30 biomarkers of inflammation and angiogenesis at the site of lesions, and selected clinical and radiological characteristics in a cohort of 93 patients. Lasso regression performs both variable selection and regularization to improve the predictive accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model. The results from the lasso regression showed analysis exhibited lack of robust statistical association between the biomarkers in hematoma fluid with age, gender, brain infarct, neurological deficiencies and volume of hematoma. However, there were associations between several of the biomarkers with postoperative recurrence requiring reoperation. The statistical analysis with lasso regression supported previous findings that the immunological characteristics of CSDH are local. The relationship between biomarkers, the radiological appearance of lesions and recurrence requiring reoperation have been inclusive using classical statistical methods on these data, but lasso regression revealed an association with inflammatory and angiogenic biomarkers in hematoma fluid. We thus suggest that lasso regression should be a recommended statistical method in research on biological processes in CSDH patients.",2017,PLoS ONE
Stability selection for metabolomics data,"In the field of metabolomics, one aims to obtain a holistic view of all small molecules (metabolites), hopefully providing information on relevant biological processes in the system under study. Data are typically measured by hyphenated mass-spectrometry based detection, leading to thousands of variables for every sample. In the typical patient-control context, this means that we are performing many tests to find relevant differences between the two classes, with the unavoidable risk of false positives, or, alternatively, very little power. Stability selection (Meinshausen and Buehlmann, 2010), using the lasso as a primary variable selection method, provides a way to avoid many of the false positives in biomarker identification by repeatedly subsampling the data, and only considering those variables as putative biomarkers that consistently show up as important. In our own work, we have shown that also selecting the largest coefficients in non-sparse regression models such as PLS works well, when combined with the stability selection framework (Wehrens et al. 2011). We support these claims with the analysis of several experimental and simulated data sets. In particular, the BioMark package for R (Wehrens and Franceschi, 2012), implementing stability selection as well as Higher Criticism thresholding, contains an experimental spike-in data set from the area of metabolomics, which can aid in further algorithm testing and development. From these analyses, it follows that stability selection is a very general and robust framework for variable selection.",2013,
An ensemble method to predict target genes and pathways in uveal melanoma,"Abstract Objective This work proposes to predict target genes and pathways for uveal melanoma (UM) based on an ensemble method and pathway analyses. Methods: The ensemble method integrated a correlation method (Pearson correlation coefficient, PCC), a causal inference method (IDA) and a regression method (Lasso) utilizing the Borda count election method. Subsequently, to validate the performance of PIL method, comparisons between confirmed database and predicted miRNA targets were performed. Ultimately, pathway enrichment analysis was conducted on target genes in top 1000 miRNA-mRNA interactions to identify target pathways for UM patients. Results: Thirty eight of the predicted interactions were matched with the confirmed interactions, indicating that the ensemble method was a suitable and feasible approach to predict miRNA targets. We obtained 50 seed miRNA-mRNA interactions of UM patients and extracted target genes from these interactions, such as ASPG, BSDC1 and C4BP. The 601 target genes in top 1,000 miRNA-mRNA interactions were enriched in 12 target pathways, of which Phototransduction was the most significant one. Conclusion: The target genes and pathways might provide a new way to reveal the molecular mechanism of UM and give hand for target treatments and preventions of this malignant tumor.",2018,Open Life Sciences
Parameterless Optimal Approximate Message Passing,"Iterative thresholding algorithms are well-suited for high-dimensional problems in sparse recovery and compressive sensing. The performance of this class of algorithms depends heavily on the tuning of certain threshold parameters. In particular, both the final reconstruction error and the convergence rate of the algorithm crucially rely on how the threshold parameter is set at each step of the algorithm. In this paper, we propose a parameter-free approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm that sets the threshold parameter at each iteration in a fully automatic way without either having an information about the signal to be reconstructed or needing any tuning from the user. We show that the proposed method attains both the minimum reconstruction error and the highest convergence rate. Our method is based on applying the Stein unbiased risk estimate (SURE) along with a modified gradient descent to find the optimal threshold in each iteration. Motivated by the connections between AMP and LASSO, it could be employed to find the solution of the LASSO for the optimal regularization parameter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work concerning parameter tuning that obtains the fastest convergence rate with theoretical guarantees.",2013,ArXiv

We used Poisson regression and survival analysis techniques to identify factors associated with prevalent and incident GW. Results At enrolment, GW prevalence was 1.6% (8/492) among HIV seronegative, and 6.6% (18/273) among HIV-1 seropositive women (p 200 cells/Î¼l and 15.6 per 100 py among HIV-1 positive women with a CD4 count â‰¤200 cells/Î¼l (ptrend<0.001). Incidence was 3.6 per 100 py for women on HAART. At baseline, prevalent GW were strongly associated with smoking (adjusted OR 4.78, 95% CI 1.53â€“14.97; p=0.007). During follow-up, being HIV-1 infected with baseline CD4 â‰¤200 cells/Î¼l was the factor most strongly associated with incident GW (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 11.82, 95% CI 3.74â€“37.38; p<0.001). Concurrent bacterial vaginosis (aIRR 2.38, 95% CI 1.35â€“4.19; p=0.003), and genital ulceration (aIRR 3.34, 95% CI 1.49â€“7.49; p=0.003) were also associated with incident GW. There was weak evidence that concurrent HAART was protective against incident GW (aIRR 0.50, 95% CI 0.19â€“1.29; p=0.15). Conclusions Genital warts occur much more frequently among HIV-1 infected women, particularly those with lower CD4 counts. HAART may be protective against GW.",2009,

Major depressive disorder subtypes to predict long-term course.,"BACKGROUND
Variation in the course of major depressive disorder (MDD) is not strongly predicted by existing subtype distinctions. A new subtyping approach is considered here.


METHODS
Two data mining techniques, ensemble recursive partitioning and Lasso generalized linear models (GLMs), followed by k-means cluster analysis are used to search for subtypes based on index episode symptoms predicting subsequent MDD course in the World Mental Health (WMH) surveys. The WMH surveys are community surveys in 16 countries. Lifetime DSM-IV MDD was reported by 8,261 respondents. Retrospectively reported outcomes included measures of persistence (number of years with an episode, number of years with an episode lasting most of the year) and severity (hospitalization for MDD, disability due to MDD).


RESULTS
Recursive partitioning found significant clusters defined by the conjunctions of early onset, suicidality, and anxiety (irritability, panic, nervousness-worry-anxiety) during the index episode. GLMs found additional associations involving a number of individual symptoms. Predicted values of the four outcomes were strongly correlated. Cluster analysis of these predicted values found three clusters having consistently high, intermediate, or low predicted scores across all outcomes. The high-risk cluster (30.0% of respondents) accounted for 52.9-69.7% of high persistence and severity, and it was most strongly predicted by index episode severe dysphoria, suicidality, anxiety, and early onset. A total symptom count, in comparison, was not a significant predictor.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite being based on retrospective reports, results suggest that useful MDD subtyping distinctions can be made using data mining methods. Further studies are needed to test and expand these results with prospective data.",2014,Depression and anxiety
Managing a Linked Open Ontology Cloud for the Web of Data,"Web of Data is rapidly becoming a backbone of Digital Libraries. Here data is collected into Linked (Open) Data (LOD) clouds. The idea is that if cross-domain heterogeneous content can be made interoperable in the cloud, then datasets will enrich each other semantically across data silos, enabling more comprehensive and intelligent services for human end-users and web services. A prerequisite for data interoperability is that the domain-specific ontologies used in data annotations in different domains are interoperable, too. This paper argues that Linked (Open) Ontology (LOO) clouds are needed in addition to LOD clouds. A LOO cloud needs, aside from traditional data mapping relations used in LOD clouds (e.g., owl:sameAs), transitive hierarchical relations (e.g., rdfs:subClassOf) between the component ontologies, which need to be managed carefully across ontology boundaries. We present a process model for maintaining a cloud of interlinked light-weight ontologies, based on legacy thesauri, where transitivity of rdfs:subClassOf relations within and across ontologies is of concern. The model has been used and evaluated in practice in building a cloud called KOKO of fifteen ontologies, with a total of 45,000 concepts, forming a basis for the Finnish national cross-domain Linked Data architecture. KOKO has been published as a web service and is in use in various fields of the society, for both data indexing and semantic search and linking. 1 Why Linked Open Ontology Cloud? Libraries, museums, archives, governments, media companies, and other organizations have been using domain-specific thesauri, subject headings, and classifications for content indexing (annotation) for decades. With the stronger need on cross-domain interconnectivity brought forth by the Web of Data [8] and the Semantic Web1, interoperability between semantically heterogeneous data repositories of different distributed content providers has become a critical challenge of research and practise. Enabling the different domain-specific vocabularies to link to one another in meaningful ways would allow the different organizations to benefit from each otherâ€™s work by enriching a common pool of linked knowledge [10]. The Web of Data movement2 has focused efforts on building cross-domain interoperability by creating and using (typically) owl:sameAs mappings between the 1 http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ 2 http://linkeddata.org/ datasets in the Linked Open Data (LOD) Cloud. However, when linking data, not only data but also ontologies are needed for interoperability, and this calls for more refined ontology alignment techniques [6] than when mapping data instances only. The research hypothesis of this paper is that the LOD cloud needs to be complemented by developing a light-weight â€œLinked Open Ontology Cloudâ€ (LOO). The idea of LOO is to provide a shared cross-domain ontology for data annotations. Developing such a linked structure based on domain-specific ontologies is in many ways different from linking datasets. A major difference between using LOD and LOO clouds is that in LOO the linked structure is used for reasoning based on vocabularies. Most fundamentally, subclass reasoning is typically used in applications. Even this simple task needs special consideration at the ontology boundaries, otherwise cross-domain reasoning and ontology-based query/document expansion [2,11] in applications, a major use case for ontologies, may fail [9]. For example, assume that the concept â€œMirrorâ€ is present in an ontology A of daily utensils and has the subclass â€œMake-up-mirrorâ€, and that in a related ontology B of furniture, the class Mirror is used as a subclass of the class Furniture a:Make-up-mirror rdfs:subClassOf a:Mirror . # Utensils ont. A b:Mirror rdfs:subClassOf b:Furniture . # Furniture ont. B a:Mirror owl:sameAs b:Mirror . # Mapping A and B Reasoning and query expansion may work fine in A and B separately, but when using A and B linked together with the owl:sameAs mapping, expanding a search query for â€œfurnitureâ€ would return falsely make-up mirrors (in addition to pieces of furniture). Even in this fundamental case of subclass reasoning, larger contexts have to be considered when linking ontologies. There are also other difficulties specific to developing a LOO cloud. For example, the principle of dividing a shared concept C into subclasses in different ontologies may be different (e.g., â€œclothesâ€ may divided into subclasses based on the gender or the age of their wearers). Then, from a human perspective, C may have a confusing mixture of subclasses in the linked ontology, hampering its use in user interfaces (e.g., as a search facet). Addressing issues like these is hard to automate, and therefore LOO development in practice requires more coordination of collaboration between the developers of linked ontologies than between the developers of linked datasets of instances. The good news is, however, that in this way better quality links can be created, which is becoming a more and more critical issue of Linked Data. Coordinating collaboration also facilitates larger scale ontology development, prevents creating interoperability problems to be solved afterwards, and minimizes redundant ontology development work in overlapping areas of ontologies. To test and evaluate these hypotheses in practise, a LOO cloud called KOKO of cross-domain ontologies (e.g., health, cultural heritage, agriculture, seafaring, government, defense, etc.) has been realized in Finland on a national level during the FinnONTO project (2003â€“2012) and is now being maintained and developed further by the National Library of Finland. The system is based on transforming a set of 15 legacy thesauri in use into light-weight ontologies and interlinking them with each other, and more ontologies are being integrated into the system. The result is KOKO, a harmonized global ontology of some 45,000 concepts aligned into a single hierarchy. From the end-userâ€™s viewpoint, KOKO ontology is seen and used as a single ontology without boundaries; for the ontology developers, domain boundaries are needed in order to divide responsibilities of distributed ontology work based on domain expertize needed in different parts of the KOKO cloud. KOKO ontology has been published and is in use as a service in the national ontology library system ONKI3 [21,22]. ONKI has currently some 11,000 unique monthly human users and over 400 registered API users. Several issues need to be taken into account when moving from developing individual thesauri into developing and maintaining a cloud of interlinked ontologies. In this paper the following challenges are discussed, and a model addressing these questions is presented, using the KOKO ontology cloud as a case study. â€“ Creation of ontologies. How is an existing legacy thesaurus transformed into an ontology? How is a new ontology mapped into the linked ontology system? How are the URIs of the concepts formed? â€“ Development of ontologies. How are the overlapping parts of ontologies recognized in order to minimize the duplicate work of the ontology developers? How are the changes in one ontology communicated to other ontologies? How are the errors and other quality issues recognized in a system of several ontologies? â€“ Publication of ontologies. How should the linked ontology system be presented to the end-user in order to make it comprehensible? What kind of services for using the ontologies are needed for different user groups? In the following, Section 2 presents our model for creating and updating a LOO cloud. Then Section 3 discusses the development cycle of the LOO the cloud and Section 4 the publication process. Finally, contributions of the paper are summarized and related work presented in Section 5. 2 Model for Managing Linked Ontologies Our ontology development work started by a small field study on how thesauri in use are actually developed. The result was that thesauri are typically developed by independent expert groups focusing on concepts in their own domains of interest, with little collaboration between the groups. The situation seems to be more or less similar in other countries, too. Obviously, this model leads to redundant work in developing overlapping areas of thesauri and, at the same time, to interoperability problems between the thesauri, since different parties define their concepts without considering each othersâ€™ choices. To address these problems we propose below a more coordinated collaborative process model for developing a LOO cloud. Pre-processing Phase First, existing thesauri and ontologies are selected for building blocks of the ontology cloud. A thesaurus is converted into RDF format using a shared ontology schema and aligned with a general upper ontology (GUO). Aligning domain ontologies with GUO forms a basis for interoperability by providing a complete hierarchy and is much easier to maintain than direct mappings between domain ontologies [7].",2013,
Painting and Plurality,"The images: can we picture to ourselves, when we hear of a plurality of images, not a collection of discrete individual images but an abundance unsurveyable and without internal differentiation? Just as one hears in so many languages of the waters: die WÃ¤sser, les eaux. . . . In the flux of experience it may be no more possible to isolate a singular â€œimageâ€ than it is to isolate a singular â€œwater.â€ The waters, according to Roberto Calasso in his meditation on Hindu mythology, Ka, symbolize the glittering flow of inner images, the ceaseless proliferation of specters and simulacra, that constitutes consciousness.1 Nevertheless, in the most prevalent theories of images developed by theology, by classical epistemology, by the academies of art, premodern and modern alike, and by anthropology, the image is paradigmatically still, framed, and graspable. The image stands alone, outside time. Whereas in experience, which is a flow of images in time, every image is in the process of becoming another image, for percepts, memories, and dreams are images generated and coordinated by the body.

"Influence of Late Cretaceous Climate Change to Extinction of Dinosaurs in Jiayin Area of Heilongjiang,Analyzed by Spore and Pollen","The Jiayin area of Heilongjiang Province is the first fossil dinosaur locality in China.Many fossils have been found from this area but lacking reasonable explanation to the living environment and extinction causes of the dinosaurs.The Late Cretaceous dinosaur-bearing strata have been divided in ascending order as the Yong'an,Taipinglinchang,Yuliangzi and Furao formations.The strata contain abundant dinosaurs and sporopollen fossils,and the Polypodiaceaesporites-Monosulcites-Beaupreaidites,Cyathidites-Taxodiaceaepollenites-Aguilapollenites and Classopollis-Ephedripites-Sphagnumsporites assemblages have been recognized.The fossil assemblages and sedimentary records show that the Jiayin area was generally in subtropical climate during Late Cretaceous.The assemblage variation of spore and pollen indicates a change from warm humid to dry hot climates.Abundance of salt-alkaline megatherm Classopollis-Ephedripites assemblage in a limited time illustrates a short duration of dry hot climate by latest Cretaceous.Such extreme climatic change and ecologic overturn are possible causes of the dinosaur extinction in the study area.Other factors,such as asteroid impact and large(volcanic)(eruption) triggering global mass extinction caused the regional climate change.",2006,
"NSABP B-41, a Randomized Neoadjuvant Trial: Genes and Signatures Associated with Pathologic Complete Response.","PURPOSE
In NSABP B-41, pathologic complete response (pCR) was associated with prolonged survival among women with HER2-positive operable breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and lapatinib, trastuzumab, or the combination. We used a large human breast cancer gene expression panel to select candidate prognostic biomarkers for pCR among women treated with trastuzumab in NSABP B-41.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Eligible patients had a baseline pre-adjuvant treatment core biopsy sample, known pCR status, and no withdrawal of consent. We analyzed extracted RNA using the human nCounterÂ® Breast Cancer 360â„¢ gene expression panel. Gene counts were normalized to housekeeping genes and transformed into logarithmic scale with base two. To screen for candidate genes and meta-gene signatures prognostic of pCR, we used univariate logistic regression. Variable selection was done by multivariable logistic regression with lasso regularization.


RESULTS
Analyses of data from 130 patients revealed that a composite of gene expression from 19 genes and one gene signature appeared to predict pCR in women with HER2-positive early- stage breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab-containing regimens. The identified genes are involved in important pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, adhesion and migration, estrogen receptor signaling, DNA damage and repair, apoptosis, and proliferation. The AUC from a 10-fold cross validation on predicting pCR, with these 20 genomic markers in a logistic regression model, was 0.73.


CONCLUSIONS
The expression level of ERBB2, ESR1, and few other genomic markers was highly predictive of pCR after trastuzumab-containing regimens. These findings need to be validated and calibrated in future studies.",2020,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research
Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infection in HIV-1-infected women taking antiretroviral therapy: a prospective cohort study from Burkina Faso,"OBJECTIVES
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) are common sexually transmitted infections (STI). We assessed the cumulative risk of NG and CT in a cohort of HIV-1-infected high-risk women taking antiretrovirals over 4 years in Burkina Faso.


METHODS
Between March 2007 and February 2011, participants were followed every 3-6 months. At each visit, participants underwent a gynaecological examination with collection of cervical and vaginal swabs. Random-effects logistic regression models were used to analyse associations of NG and CT infection with behavioural and biological factors.


RESULTS
172 women had samples tested for NG and CT during the study period, in a total of 1135 visits. NG was detected in 6.4% of women (11/172, 95% CI 2.7 to 10.1) at a rate of 2.76 cases (95% CI 1.53 to 4.99) per 100 person-years. CT was detected in 1.7% (3/172, 95% CI 0 to 3.7) of women at a rate of 0.75 cases (95% CI 0.24 to 2.34) per 100 person-years. The majority of women were asymptomatic (9/14). In the multivariable model, the presence of NG or CT was associated with tobacco use (aOR=11.85, 95% CI 1.13 to 124.17), and concurrent genital HIV-1 RNA shedding (aOR=4.78, 95% CI 1.17 to 19.46). Higher levels of education (aOR=0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.92), and age greater than 35 years (aOR=0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.92) were associated with lower odds of infection.


CONCLUSIONS
The risk of NG or CT infection remains low among high-risk women in Bobo-Dioulasso. This provides some evidence that antiretroviral use does not contribute to behavioural disinhibition. The asymptomatic nature of most infections underscores the need for regular screening and treatment of STIs in core groups.",2014,Sexually Transmitted Infections
Microbial diversity within the Trichodesmium holobiont.,"Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in the genus Trichodesmium play a critical role in the productivity of the tropical and subtropical oligotrophic oceans. The ecological success of these populations is likely associated with the diverse microbial interactions occurring within the Trichodesmium holobiont, especially between Trichodesmium and heterotrophic bacterial epibionts. Yet, the composition of the Trichodesmium holobiont and the processes governing microbial assemblage are not well documented. Here, we used high-resolution 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing to examine the diversity of Trichodesmium and associated epibionts across different ocean regions and colony morphologies (puffs and rafts). Trichodesmium Clade I (i.e., T. thiebautii-like) dominated the colonies in all ocean basins regardless of morphology, although the Trichodesmium community structure significantly varied between morphologies in some regions. On average, Alphaproteobacteria (i.e., Thalassobius), Gammaproteobacteria (i.e., Pseudoalteromonas), Sphingobacteria (i.e., Microscilla and Vibrio) and Flavobacteria dominated the epibiont communities, but community composition and structure significantly differed between regions. Epibionts from the two colony morphologies were taxonomically and functionally distinct in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. These findings suggest that the colony types might define two distinct niches and that epibiont assemblage might be driven in part by selective processes, where epibionts are selected according to their influence on colony metabolism.",2016,Environmental microbiology
Lassoing the HAR Model: A Model Selection Perspective on Realized Volatility Dynamics,"Realized volatility computed from high-frequency data is an important measure for many applications in finance, and its dynamics have been widely investigated. Recent notable advances that perform well include the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model which can approximate long memory, is very parsimonious, is easy to estimate, and features good out-of-sample performance. We prove that the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) recovers the lags structure of the HAR model asymptotically if it is the true model, and we present Monte Carlo evidence in finite samples. The HAR model's lags structure is not fully in agreement with the one found using the Lasso on real data. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that there are two clear breaks in structure for most of the assets we consider. These results bring into question the appropriateness of the HAR model for realized volatility. Finally, in an out-of-sample analysis, we show equal performance of the HAR model and the Lasso approach.",2016,Econometric Reviews
Parallel and Distributed Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe Algorithms,"We study parallel and distributed Frank-Wolfe algorithms; the former on shared memory machines with mini-batching, and the latter in a delayed update framework. In both cases, we perform computations asynchronously whenever possible. We assume block-separable constraints as in Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe (BCFW) method (Lacoste-Julien et al., 2013), but our analysis subsumes BCFW and reveals problemdependent quantities that govern the speedups of our methods over BCFW. A notable feature of our algorithms is that they do not depend on worst-case bounded delays, but only (mildly) on expected delays, making them robust to stragglers and faulty worker threads. We present experiments on structural SVM and Group Fused Lasso, and observe significant speedups over competing state-of-the-art (and synchronous) methods.",2016,
Intravascular ultrasound ablation and imaging catheter for treatment of atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects 1% of the population and is associated with stroke and death. AF is often triggered by foci and reentrant pathways located near the pulmonary vein. Clinical studies show that circumferential pulmonary vein ablation destroys these electrical pathways, thereby eliminating AF (Pappone, C. et al., 2003). Currently, radiofrequency (RF) electrodes are used for such treatment. However, these procedures take over 7 hours and have <80% long term success. RF burn patterns often have discontinuities, which means that electrical pathways are still intact to trigger AF. Balloon and lasso catheters have been suggested to create a continuous circumferential burn, but are not successful because it can be difficult for the catheters to form good contacts with the tissue. Intravascular ultrasound arrays can be precisely electronically steered, making it easier to produce continuous burn patterns. The same array could also image the region of interest to position the burn correctly. While large external ultrasound transducers have been used ex vivo to ablate cardiac tissue (Strickberger, A.S. et al., 1999), external ultrasound for heart procedures is difficult because air in the lungs deflects much of the ultrasound. We propose the use of an intravascular linear ultrasound array placed at the end of a catheter. We present calculations, designs, and a proof of concept experiment demonstrating the feasibility of such an intravascular ablation system.",2004,"IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium, 2004"

"Juvenile Groundfish Habitat in Kachemak Bay, Alaska, During Late Summer","We investigated the habitat of juvenile groundfishes in relation to depth, water temperature, and salinity in Kachemak Bay, Alaska. Stations ranging in depth from 10 to 70 m and with sand or mudâ€“sand substrates were sampled with a small-meshed beam trawl in Augustâ€“September of 1994 to 1999. A total of 8,201 fishes were captured, comprising at least 52 species. Most fishes (91%) had a total length 5% of the total catch) were flathead sole Hippoglossoides elassodon, slim sculpin Radulinus asprellus, Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis, and arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias. Depth accounted for most of the spatial variability in juvenile groundfish abundance, and neither temperature nor salinity was correlated with fish abundance. Juvenile groundfishes concentrated in either shallow ( 20 m) or deep (50â€“70 m) water, with co-occurrence of some species between 30â€“40 m. Shallow fishes were the rock soles, Pacific halibut, and great sculpin Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. Deep species were flathead sole, slim sculpin, spinycheek starsnout Bathyagonus infraspinatus, rex sole Glyptocephalus zachirus, tadpole sculpin Psychrolutes paradoxus, and whitebarred prickleback Poroclinus rothrocki. This 6-year study provides baseline data on relative abundance and distribution of juvenile groundfishes in Kachemak Bay and may provide a useful tool for predicting the presence of species in similar habitats in other areas of Alaska.

"Escaping Slavery and Building Diasporic Communities in French Soudan and Senegal, Ca. 1880-1940 *","Too little is known of the fate of formerly enslaved populations in the aftermath of slavery, especially in French West Africa, where slavery was abolished in 1905.1 Even less is known about slaves who obtained their freedom before the official end of slavery. Indeed, even before the French colonial authorities abolished slavery, many slaves had begun to escape. While some slaves gained their freedom by paying a ransom to their masters, many others used the new venues of emancipation offered by the French authorities, such as settling in liberty villages or being recruited in the French army. Some were eventually able to return to their homelands.2 Others founded new independent villages in the region where they had been enslaved, or migrated to wealthier areas, such as the Senegambian peanut basin.In the 1880s, most populations in Western Sudan still found themselves caught in a stranglehold between Samori Ture's troops in the South and Ahmadu's military control in the East. When Samori Ture's wars devastated the regions of Wasulu and Sikasso in Southern Mali in the 1880s-1890s, these regions became some of the main suppliers of slaves in Western Sudan.3 Samori had built a vast empire in West Africa by the end of the nineteenth century that stretched at its height from Sierra Leone to Ivory Coast. Samori started fighting the French colonial conquest in 1880, but French military campaigns conducted by Marechal Gallieni against Samori and Ahmadu Seku in 1886-1888 allowed the French to establish bases in the region.4 Indeed, Ahmadu Seku, the son of El Hajj Umar Tall and inheritor of the Tukulor Empire in 1864, was only able to contain the French military encroachment until the mid-1880s. Continuous struggles with his relatives over his father's inheritance weakened Ahmadu Seku's position in the region, while Samori had already reached Bamako in 1883 and was pushing the Tukulor toward Segu. In 1884, Ahmadu Seku launched a successful attack in Kaarta against his brother Muhammad al-Muntaga, henceforth ruling Kaarta from Nioro.5 With the aim of fighting Samori, Ahmadu Seku finally signed a treaty with the French in 1887 that would ultimately turn the Tukulor Empire into a French protectorate, leading later to the creation of the colony of French Sudan. Samori was eventually captured by the French and deported to Gabon in 1898, where he died in 1900.6Waves of refugees and slaves were often scattered along the same routes in Western Sudan in this context of intense warfare and uncertainty. People fled before the progress of Samori's troops. They sought refuge in neighboring regions, sometimes securing the protection of the French in the military posts of Kayes, Medine, Bafoulabe, or Kita, while many others were captured and sold into slavery. Refugees who escaped enslavement were nevertheless, as outsiders, often viewed as of possible slave origin by the local landlords upon their arrival in a new village.7 Western Sudan had a long, skillful, and ambiguous use of the landlord-stranger relationship. It consisted of reciprocal obligations allowing protection for strangers and travellers but also creating dependency and vassalage akin to servitude, especially in times of uncertainty.8 Meillassoux argues that the fundamental distinction between ""kin"" and ""alien"" is a question not of blood relation but of ""congeneration"" or being born and growing up together in the same social and economic networks.9 Deprived of kinship relations in the new host society, these outsiders were assigned a status almost equivalent to that of slave, except that they could leave at any moment. The similarities of status between aliens and slaves are not surprising here. As asserted by Kopytoff and Miers, as well as Meillassoux, slavery is, in many African societies, the opposite of kinship.10 Thus, strangers were most often only offered to marry slave women; the children would be subsequently considered as slaves, except when the husband was able to redeem his wife. â€¦",2015,International Journal of African Historical Studies

Integrated models for the prediction of late genitourinary complaints after high-dose intensity modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: making informed decisions.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
To develop predictive models for late radiation-induced hematuria and nocturia allowing a patient individualized estimation of pre-treatment risk.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We studied 262 PCa patients treated with curative intensity modulated radiotherapy to the intact prostate or prostate bed. A total of 372 variables were used for prediction modeling, among which 343 genetic variations. Toxicity was scored using an in-house developed toxicity scale. Predictor selection is achieved by the EMLasso procedure, a penalized logistic regression method with an EM algorithm handling missing data and crossvalidation avoiding overfit. Model performance was expressed by the area under the curve (AUC) and by sensitivity and specificity.


RESULTS
Variables of the model predicting late hematuria (36/262) are bladder volume receiving â©¾75 Gy, prostatic transurethral resection and four polymorphisms. (AUC = 0.80, sensitivity = 83.3%, specificity = 61.5%). The AUC drops to 0.67 when the genetic markers are left out. The model that predicts for late nocturia (29/262) contains the minimal clinical target volume (CTV) dose, the CTV volume and three polymorphisms (AUC = 0.76, sensitivity = 75.9%, specify = 67.4%).

Intra- and inter-rater reliability of digital image analysis for skin color measurement.,"BACKGROUND
We determined the intra- and inter-rater reliability of data from digital image color analysis between an expert and novice analyst.


METHODS
Following training, the expert and novice independently analyzed 210 randomly ordered images. Both analysts used Adobe(Â®) Photoshop lasso or color sampler tools based on the type of image file. After color correction with Pictocolor(Â®) in camera software, they recorded L*a*b* (L*=light/dark; a*=red/green; b*=yellow/blue) color values for all skin sites. We computed intra-rater and inter-rater agreement within anatomical region, color value (L*, a*, b*), and technique (lasso, color sampler) using a series of one-way intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs).


RESULTS
Results of ICCs for intra-rater agreement showed high levels of internal consistency reliability within each rater for the lasso technique (ICC â‰¥ 0.99) and somewhat lower, yet acceptable, level of agreement for the color sampler technique (ICC = 0.91 for expert, ICC = 0.81 for novice). Skin L*, skin b*, and labia L* values reached the highest level of agreement (ICC â‰¥ 0.92) and skin a*, labia b*, and vaginal wall b* were the lowest (ICC â‰¥ 0.64).


CONCLUSION
Data from novice analysts can achieve high levels of agreement with data from expert analysts with training and the use of a detailed, standard protocol.",2013,Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging
The Personal of the Event: Subjectivity and the English Civil War,"This is a text based examination of modes of politicization in Early Modern England, up to and including the English Civil War. It places subjectivity in a framework constructed around the work of Alain Badiou, Quentin Meillassoux, and Jacques Derrida in order to create new readings of English newsbooks from the 1620s and the political interventions of John Lilburne and Marchamont Nedham in the 1640s.",2013,
Gender classification and manifold learning on functional brain networks,"9 A pipeline for automatic semantic annotation of human connectomics revealed by diffusion tractography Introduction Predictive modelling of functional connectomes from structural connectomes explores commonalities across multi-modal imaging data [1]. Brain structure not only constrains but also shapes functional connectomes. We exploit this property to devise a statistically sound way, based on a connectivity identification framework. This applies the Randomised Lasso (RL) principle to sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA) [2], and transports functional connectomes on a common Riemannian manifold to retain their symmetric positive definite (SPD) geometry [3]. This framework highlights the structural connections that are consistently selected in predicting functional connectomes, across microstructural indices. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are derived from the conventional tensor model, whereas intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF), orientation dispersion index (ODI), the concentration parameter (Kappa) and the volume fraction of the isotropic compartment (ISO) are derived from a more biophysically plausible model based on Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) [4]. Methods NODDI data were obtained from 19 healthy volunteers on a 1.5T Siemens scanner based on three shells of Diffusion Weighted (DW)-MRI with b=2400smm-2, b=800smm-2 and b=300smm-2 were acquired with 240x240x150mm FOV, voxel size of 2.5x2.5x2.5mm and TR/TE=8300/98ms. Resting-state (rs)-fMRI were acquired: TR/TE=2160/30msec, effective voxel size 4.03.33.3mm, FOV 210210120mm. We run probabilistic tractography on the data acquired with b=2400smm-2, and we obtain the streamlines that connect each pair of cortical FreeSurfer regions. For each pair of regions we average the microstructural indices to obtain brain connectomes based on number of streamlines (NSTREAMS) and weighted averages of FA, MD, ICVF, ODI, Kappa and ISO, fig.1. Functional connectivity matrices are estimated as the normalised inverse of the covariance of the averaged fMRI time-series within each region, fig.2. We learn the relationship between microstructural indices (X) and rs-fMRI (Y) across subjects based on sCCA. sCCA extracts sparse vectors that are multiplied by X and Y 1 to maximize their linear relationship. sCCA is applied on vectorised versions of functional and structural connectivity across subjects. However, there is no guarantee that the results from linear operations on the elements of a SPD matrix will also lie on an SPD manifold. A solution is to project each functional con-nectome into a common tangent space (SPD-sCCA), which is constructed based on the average precision matrix. To alleviate the dependence of the extracted connections on the regularisation parameter we use RL [5]. Results Based on leave-one-out cross-validation, we â€¦",2015,
Sparse Group Fused Lasso for Model Segmentation,"This article introduces the sparse group fused lasso (SGFL) as a statistical framework for segmenting high dimensional regression models. To compute solutions of the SGFL, a nonsmooth and nonseparable convex program, we develop a hybrid optimization method that is fast, requires no tuning parameter selection, and is guaranteed to converge to a global minimizer. In numerical experiments, the hybrid method compares favorably to state-of-the-art techniques both in terms of computation time and accuracy; benefits are particularly substantial in high dimension. The hybrid method is implemented in the R package sparseGFL available on the author's Github page. The SGFL framework, presented here in the context of multivariate time series, can be extended to multichannel images and data collected over graphs.",2019,arXiv: Computation
The 2-codeword screening test for lasso problems,"Solving a lasso problem is a practical approach for acquiring a sparse representation of a signal with respect to a given dictionary. Driven by the demand for sparse representations over large-scale data in machine learning and statistics, we explore lasso screening tests. These enhance solution efficiency via the elimination of codewords absent in the optimal solution prior to detailed computation. On basis of the concept of a region test and the recently introduced dome test, we propose the 2-codeword test, which uses two codewords together in a correlation screening test. In addition to the rejection rate as the performance measure, we introduce an innovative way to access the performance of a screening test, called the uncertainty measure, via a comparison with the optimal test.",2013,"2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing"
Metagenomics of polar marine sediments: study of microbial biodiversity and isolation of new biocatalysts for use in industrial processes,"Marine bioprospecting is a highly topical research subject since the marine ecosystem is a relatively unexplored source of enzymes with potential biocatalytic activity. Development of new biocatalysts from marine extreme environments, such as Polar Regions, can be considered value-added. In fact, there is an increasing demand in bio discovering powerful biocatalysts for biotechnological applications in terms of esterase/lipases from cold environments. This is due to their salt tolerance,
hyperthermostability, barophilicity, cold adaptivity, substrate specificity and affinity.
The first session of the research project was focused on functional-based screening method to screen a collection of 100 marine bacteria isolated from Svalbard and Lofoten islands for their ability to produce a broad spectrum of cold-active enzymes.The isolated bacteria were classified by 16S rRNA sequencing and the phylogenetic distribution of the detected activities was evaluated with the interest for finding new cold-active biocatalysts.
In the second session of the project, a gene encoding for an esterase was amplified by PCR from a bacterial sequenced genome belonging to Thalassospira sp.
GB04J01. After cloning and gene heterologous expression in E. coli, the recombinant protein was obtained as high level in soluble form and then purified to homogeneity.
A full structural and functional protein characterization was carried on and in addition, the enzyme was able to form diamond crystals which diffracted at 1.7 A.
This was the first biochemical characterization and structural analysis of a cold-active esterase isolated from the genus Thalassospira.
A parallel session of the project was aimed at identifying and at characterizing a new cold-active and salt tolerant esterase isolated from Arctic metagenomic libraries.
Taking advantage of an â€œomicâ€ technique, such as Metagenomics, it was possible to access to unculturable microbes in such extreme environment, the Arctic.
A fosmid containing an ORF encoding a gene with potential esterase/lipase activity was detected by functional screening on tributyrin agar plates. The positive clones
employing the largest halo size were sequenced and a gene encoding a putative lipase was found.
Gene cloning and expression were followed by a production of the recombinant protein in a soluble form. A biochemical approach highlighted protein features with a functional characterization methodology.
To achieve the summarized results several expertise in different research fields were required. The research activity was realized through short exchanges of researchers
between Italy and Norway. This research project and the data obtained strongly represent a contribution to enhance the market of cold-active lipolytic enzymes of white biotechnology field as powerful biocatalysts.",2014,
Using Definitive Screening Designs to Identify Active First- and Second-Order Factor Effects,"Definitive screening designs (DSDs) were recently introduced by Jones and Nachtsheim (2011b). The use of three-level factors and the desirable aliasing structure of the DSDs make them potentially suitable for identifying main effects and second-order terms in one stage of experimentation. However, as the number of active effects approaches the number of runs, the performance of standard model-selection routines will inevitably degrade. In this paper, we characterize the ability of DSDs to correctly identify first- and second-order model terms as a function of the level of sparsity, the number of factors in the design, the signal-to-noise ratio, the model type (unrestricted or following strong heredity), the model-selection technique, and the number of augmented runs. We find that minimum-run-size DSDs can be used to identify active terms with high probability as long as the number of effects is less than or equal to about half the number of runs and the signal-to-noise ratios for the active effects are above about 2.0. We also find that if minimum-run-size designs are augmented with four or more runs, the number of model terms that can be identified with high probability increases substantially. Among the model-selection methods investigated, we found that both Lasso and the Gaussâ€“Dantzig selector (both based on AICc) can be used to effectively identify active model terms in the presence of unrestricted models. For models following strong heredity, the SHIM method developed by Choi et al. (2010) was the best among methods tested that were designed for the strong-heredity case.",2017,Journal of Quality Technology
Learning high-dimensional graphical models with regularized quadratic scoring,"Pairwise Markov Random Fields (MRFs) or undirected graphical models are parsimonious representations of joint probability distributions. Variables correspond to nodes of a graph, with edges between nodes corresponding to conditional dependencies. Unfortunately, likelihood-based learning and inference is hampered by the intractability of computing the normalizing constant. This paper considers an alternative scoring rule to the log-likelihood, which obviates the need to compute the normalizing constant of the distribution. We show that the rule is a quadratic function of the natural parameters. We optimize the sum of this scoring rule and a sparsity-inducing regularizer. For general continuous-valued exponential families, we provide theoretical results on parameter and edge consistency. As a special case we detail a new approach to sparse precision matrix estimation whose theoretical guarantees match that of the graphical lasso of Yuan and Lin (2007), with faster computational performance than the glasso algorithm of Yuan (2010). We then describe results for model selection in the nonparametric pairwise graphical model using exponential series. The regularized score matching problem is shown to be a convex program; we provide scalable algorithms based on consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (Boyd et al. (2011)) and coordinate-wise descent.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
The Economics of Kinship,"The study of kinship systems in Africa has, for a long time, contributed a great deal to the anthropological study of kinship in general. Much of this kinship theory has been concerned with the formal properties of kinship systems: the semantic content of kinship nomenclature; or concerns such as the nature of rules governing descent, residence, and affinity. If the study of such properties in and of themselves has done a great deal to refine descriptive techniques, it has provided little in the way of explanation. Early anthropologists such as Morgan (1963 [1877]) attempted to relate such formal attributes of kinship systems to other features of societies, particularly the economic domain. Unfortunately, the discredit which such theories earned in the twentieth century tended to discourage anthropologists from making comparative causal generalization. As the titles of the three books in question might suggest, the trend has happily been reversed. Indeed, Cuisenier, Goody, and Meillassoux use a cross-cultural framework of one kind or another to discuss the relationship of economic to kinship systems. Moreover, all three have done field work in the African continent: Cuisenier among Arabs in northern Tunisia; Goody among the LoDagaa and Gonja of northern Ghana; and Meillassoux among the Guro of Ivory Coast, as well as among a variety of groups in modern Mali. All three books compare, in one way or another, African societies with societies in other continents. The similarities, however, are in fact far less striking than the differences in aims, theoretical frameworks, and methods of comparison; each represents an entirely different style of approach to the problem. Cuisenier's book is the only one which relies principally on the author's own field work. Whereas the first half deals with Turkey, the second is concerned with Tunisia. In each case, the author deals with not one but a number of different",1978,African Studies Review
Conjugate direction boosting for regression,"Boosting in the context of linear regression has gained additional attraction by the invention of least angle regression (LARS), where the connection between the lasso and forward stagewise fitting (boosting) was established. Earlier it has been found that boosting is a functional gradient optimization. Instead of the gradient method, we propose a conjugate direction method to minimize the residual sum of squares as a function of the regression coefficients. The result is a fast forward variable selection algorithm (CDBoost). The addition of shrinkage (small step-sizes) is only possible with an adjustment in form of a restart condition. For infinitesimal shrinkage this leads to an algorithm between forward stagewise fitting (boosting) and least angle regression. In particular, it also employs variable selection. While least angle regression seems to be restricted to linear regression, we can easily generalize our approach to arbitrary learners (fitting methods) like trees or splines, as for boosting. The learner is used to produce vectors of fitted values which can then be linearly fitted by CDBoost. The different methods are compared on simulated and real datasets. CDBoost achieves the best predictions mainly in complicated settings with correlated covariates, where it is difficult to assign how much a covariate contributes to the response. The gain of CDBoost over boosting is especially high in low and mid noise problems.",2004,
Radiomics signature for prediction of lateral lymph node metastasis in conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma,"PURPOSE
Preoperative neck ultrasound (US) for lateral cervical lymph nodes is recommended for all patients undergoing thyroidectomy for thyroid malignancy, but it is operator dependent. We aimed to develop a radiomics signature using US images of the primary tumor to preoperatively predict lateral lymph node metastasis (LNM) in patients with conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma (cPTC).


METHODS
Four hundred consecutive cPTC patients from January 2004 to February 2006 were enrolled as the training cohort, and 368 consecutive cPTC patients from March 2006 to February 2007 served as the validation cohort. A radiomics signature, which consisted of 14 selected features, was generated by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model in the training cohort. The discriminating performance of the radiomics signature was assessed in the validation cohort with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).


RESULTS
The radiomics signature was significantly associated with lateral cervical lymph node status (p < 0.001). The AUC of its performance in discriminating metastatic and non-metastatic lateral cervical lymph nodes was 0.710 (95% CI: 0.649-0.770) in the training cohort and was 0.621 (95% CI: 0.560-0.682) in the validation cohort.


CONCLUSIONS
The present study showed that US radiomic features of the primary tumor were associated with lateral cervical lymph node status. Although their discriminatory performance was slightly lower in the validation cohort, our study shows that US radiomic features of the primary tumor alone have the potential to predict lateral LNM.",2020,PLoS ONE
The Oblique Mattress Lasso-Loop Stitch for Arthroscopic Capsulolabral Repair.,"Arthroscopic capsulolabral repair during shoulder stabilization surgery requires the use of suture anchors. Several arthroscopic suturing techniques for capsulolabral repair have been described, and each carries very specific advantages and disadvantages with regard to risk, patient satisfaction, and functional outcomes. The purpose of this report is to describe the oblique mattress lasso-loop stitch. This stitch (1) provides strong initial fixation of the labrum, (2) establishes labral height and allows for larger capsular plication if needed, (3) prevents the suture from cutting through the radial fibers of the glenoid labrum, (4) prevents knot migration to the articular side and loosening of the knot, and (5) requires fewer implants and preserves glenoid bone stock by increasing the amount of labrum and capsule that can be reattached to the glenoid with a single-loaded suture anchor.",2016,Arthroscopy techniques
Exploiting Sparse User Activity in Multiuser Detection,"The number of active users in code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems is often much lower than the spreading gain. The present paper exploits fruitfully this a priori information to improve performance of multiuser detectors. A low-activity factor manifests itself in a sparse symbol vector with entries drawn from a finite alphabet that is augmented by the zero symbol to capture user inactivity. The non-equiprobable symbols of the augmented alphabet motivate a sparsity-exploiting maximum a posteriori probability (S-MAP) criterion, which is shown to yield a cost comprising the â„“2 least-squares error penalized by the p-th norm of the wanted symbol vector (p = 0, 1, 2). Related optimization problems appear in variable selection (shrinkage) schemes developed for linear regression, as well as in the emerging field of compressive sampling (CS). The contribution of this work to such sparse CDMA systems is a gamut of sparsity-exploiting multiuser detectors trading off performance for complexity requirements. From the vantage point of CS and the least-absolute shrinkage selection operator (Lasso) spectrum of applications, the contribution amounts to sparsity-exploiting algorithms when the entries of the wanted signal vector adhere to finite-alphabet constraints.",2011,IEEE Transactions on Communications

Plant colonization across the GalÃ¡pagos Islands: Success of the sea dispersal syndrome,"A new approach for investigating evidence for the capacity of plant colonization between islands and the success of plant morphological traits associated with seed dispersal is presented. As colonization is the result of dispersal and establishment, oceanic archipelagos provide an ideal spatio-temporal system in which to analyse plant dispersal traits related to current distributions of species across islands. The Galapagos archipelago comprises 12 islands > 10 km 2 that harbour 403 native angiosperms, of which 313 native species occupy lowland habitats that are present on all islands. We inferred the minimum number of colonization events within the archipelago for the species (289 lowland species) present on more than one island (floristic analysis). The distribution (number of islands) of species across the islands was slightly left-skewed, with 58% of all lowland species being present on one to six islands. The success of dispersal syndromes (i.e. morphological trait sets of the diaspores associated with dispersal) favourable to inter-island dispersal (medium-distance dispersal, MDD) was also analysed (syndrome analysis). In particular, the 289 lowland species were classified into four dispersal groups (syndromes): sea (thalassochory), wind (anemochory), and animal interior (endozoochory) or animal exterior (epizoochory). Most species (N = 174, 55.6%), however, displayed no traits related to MDD (unspecialized diaspores). Analyses of the distribution of syndrome traits across the 289 lowland native species and 12 islands revealed that: (1) species with one or more of the four MDD syndromes did not have broader distributions than those with unspecialized diaspores; (2) species with sea dispersal traits were the most broadly distributed; and (3) a net loss of dispersability for diaspore traits (from non-endemic natives to endemic species) was not supported for the whole flora by our analyses. In summary, our analyses showed that species with sea-drifting diaspore traits were significantly associated with the success of plant colonization across the Galapagos Islands.

Endoscopic management and prevention of migrated esophageal stents.,"The use of self-expandable metallic stents has increased recently to palliate inoperable esophageal neoplasia and also in the management of benign strictures. Migration is one of the most common complications after stent placement and the endoscopist should be able to recognize and manage this situation. Several techniques for managing migrated stents have been described, as well as new techniques for preventing stent migration. Most stents have a ""lasso"" at the upper flange which facilitates stent repositioning or removal. An overtube, endoloop and large polypectomy snare may be useful for the retrieval of stents migrated into the stomach. External fixation of the stent with Shim's technique is efficient in preventing stent migration. Suturing the stent to the esophageal wall, new stent designs with larger flanges and double-layered stents are promising techniques to prevent stent migration but they warrant validation in a larger cohort of patients.",2014,World journal of gastrointestinal endoscopy
Techniques to cope with missing data in hostâ€“pathogen protein interaction prediction,"MOTIVATION
Approaches that use supervised machine learning techniques for protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction typically use features obtained by integrating several sources of data. Often certain attributes of the data are not available, resulting in missing values. In particular, our host-pathogen PPI datasets have a large fraction, in the range of 58-85% of missing values, which makes it challenging to apply machine learning algorithms.


RESULTS
We show that specialized techniques for missing value imputation can improve the performance of the models significantly. We use cross species information in combination with machine learning techniques like Group lasso with â„“(1)/â„“(2) regularization. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on two PPI prediction problems. In our first example of Salmonella-human PPI prediction, we are able to obtain high prediction accuracies with 77.6% precision and 84% recall. Comparison with various other techniques shows an improvement of 9 in F1 score over the next best technique. We also apply our method to Yersinia-human PPI prediction successfully, demonstrating the generality of our approach.

An efficient algorithm for sparse inverse covariance matrix estimation based on dual formulation,"Estimating large and sparse inverse covariance matrix plays a fundamental role in modern multivariate analysis, because the zero entries capture the conditional independence between pairs of variables given all other variables. This estimation task can be realized by penalizing the maximum likelihood estimation with an adaptive group lasso penalty imposed directly on the elements of the inverse, which allows the estimated to have a blockwise sparse structure that is particularly useful in some applications. In the paper, we are particularly interested in studying the implementation of optimization algorithms for minimizing a class of log-determinant model. This considered minimization model, one the one hand, contains a large number of popular sparse models as special cases, but on the other hand, it poses more challenges especially in high-dimensional situations. Instead of targeting the challenging optimization problem directly, we employ the symmetric Gaussâ€“Seidel (sGS) iteration based alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to tackle the 3-block nonsmooth dual program. By choosing an appropriate proximal term, it was shown that the implemented sGS-ADMM is equivalent to the 2-block ADMM, so its convergence is followed directly from some existing theoretical results. Numerical experiments on synthetic data and real data sets, including the performance comparisons with the directly extended ADMM, demonstrate that the implemented algorithm is effective in estimating large and sparse inverse covariance matrices.",2018,Comput.

Understanding ceramic variability: an archaeometrical interpretation of the Classical and Hellenistic ceramics at DÃ¼zen Tepe and Sagalassos (Southwest Turkey),"Within the aim of contributing to the artisanal craft history at Sagalassos (SW-Turkey), an archaeometric programme including thin section analysis, ICP-MS and multivariate statistics was developed to define the variability on a provenance and/or technological scale of the Classical/Hellenistic ceramic assemblage of Sagalassos and Duzen Tepe. The obtained data were used to evaluate the extent and variation of local pottery production. Petrographic and geochemical analysis as a grouping technique proves to be conditional for documenting the variation in ceramic wares present on both archaeological sites. Elemental evidence supports local production activities between Classical and Hellenistic times, documenting a deliberate change in treatment of raw materials during the Late Hellenistic period in function of ware groups.",2011,Journal of Archaeological Science
Extended Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregression : macroeconomic forecasting with the Lasso,"This paper considers macroeconomic forecasting with a large number of predictor variables. We propose an extended factor-augmented vector autoregressive model (EFAVAR), that describes the joint dynamics of macro variables, latent factors and high-dimensional predictors. Furthermore, We employ a factor model to obtain a small number of principal-component-based factor estimates which can represent common movement of informational data. Meanwhile, we utilize the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) to select a few of the most relevant observed predictors, which can capture idiosyncratic fluctuation of data. Then, the multi-step-ahead forecasts can be constructed using a handful of estimated factors and selected predictors. In addition, we investigate the consistency of Lasso estimate and forecasting accuracy in the theoretical perspective. Also, we examine the predictive performance by a small Monte Carlo study and an empirical analysis, and conclude that EFAVAR shows some improvements in comparison to other model candidates.",2016,

"Think global, act local when estimating a sparse precision matrix","Substantial progress has been made in the estimation
of sparse high dimensional precision matrices from scant datasets.
This is important because precision matrices underpin common tasks
such as regression, discriminant analysis, and portfolio
optimization. However, few good algorithms for this task exist
outside the space of L1 penalized optimization approaches like
GLASSO. This thesis introduces LGM, a new algorithm for the
estimation of sparse high dimensional precision matrices. Using the
framework of probabilistic graphical models, the algorithm performs
robust covariance estimation to generate potentials for small
cliques and fuses the local structures to form a sparse yet
globally robust model of the entire distribution. Identification of
appropriate local structures is done through stochastic discrete
optimization. The algorithm is implemented in Matlab and
benchmarked against competitor algorithms for an array of synthetic
datasets. Simulation results suggest that LGM may outperform GLASSO
when model sparsity is especially important and when variables in
the dataset belong to a number of closely related (if unknown)
groups.",2016,
Machine learning prediction of coordination energies for alkali group elements in battery electrolyte solvents.,"We combined a data science-driven method with quantum chemistry calculations, and applied it to the battery electrolyte problem. We performed quantum chemistry calculations on the coordination energy (Ecoord) of five alkali metal ions (Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) to electrolyte solvent, which is intimately related to ion transfer at the electrolyte/electrode interface. Three regression methods, namely, multiple linear regression (MLR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and exhaustive search with linear regression (ES-LiR), were employed to find the relationship between Ecoord and descriptors. Descriptors include both ion and solvent properties, such as the radius of metal ions or the atomic charge of solvent molecules. Our results clearly indicate that the ionic radius and atomic charge of the oxygen atom that is connected to the metal ion are the most important descriptors. Good prediction accuracy for Ecoord of 0.127 eV was obtained using ES-LiR, meaning that we can predict Ecoord for any alkali ion without performing quantum chemistry calculations for ion-solvent pairs. Further improvement in the prediction accuracy was made by applying the exhaustive search with Gaussian process, which yields 0.016 eV for the prediction accuracy of Ecoord.",2019,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP
Solution of linear ill-posed problems using random dictionaries,"In the present paper we consider application of overcomplete dictionaries to solution of general ill-posed linear inverse problems. In the context of regression problems, there have been enormous amount of effort to recover an unknown function using such dictionaries. One of the most popular methods, Lasso and its versions, is based on minimizing empirical likelihood and, unfortunately, requires stringent assumptions on the dictionary, the, so called, compatibility conditions. While these conditions may be satisfied for the functions in the original dictionary, they usually do not hold for their images due to contraction imposed by the linear operator. Pensky (2016) showed that this difficulty can be bypassed by inverting each of the dictionary functions and matching the resulting expansion to the true function. However, even then the approach requires a compatibility condition which is difficult to check. In the present paper, we propose a solution which utilizes structured and unstructured random dictionaries, the technique that have not been applied so far to the solution of ill-posed linear inverse problems. We put a theoretical foundation under the suggested methodology and study its performance via simulations.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory
The physical and mechanical properties of composite cements manufactured with calcareous and clayey Greek diatomite mixtures,"The aim of the present study is to test diatomite rocks as alternative pozzolanic materials that could be used for the manufacturing of pozzolanic cements in Greece. The diatomite rocks used occur in Samos Island and in the Elassona, Greece. The Samos diatomites were mainly consisted of calcite and opal-A, whereas the Elassona diatomite consisted of opal-A, clay minerals, feldspars and quartz. As a result, the Samos samples were rich in CaO and SiO2, while the Elassona ones were rich in SiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3. The specific surface of the laboratory-produced cements was high, with the grindability of the Elassona diatomites being lower than that of Samos. The water demand of all blended cements was higher than that of the laboratory produced OPC. The late compressive strength of most diatomite cements studied was improved with respect to the lab OPC.",2005,Cement & Concrete Composites
The Royal Chapel in the Time of the Habsburgs: Music and Court Ceremony in Early Modern Europe (review),"many of the discussions in the book familiar. Nonetheless, they take a new form in this work. The chapter on â€˜Theories of the Affections and Imitationâ€™, for instance, begins with the debate between Stoic philosophers, who deplored the passions, and the acceptance of the passions by Aristotle and the Epicureans. Palisca traces the reception of these philosophies across a great geographical and chronological expanse, drawing upon the writings of Lorenzo Valla (De voluptate (Paris, 1512)), Juan Luis Vives (De anima et vita libri tres (Basle, 1538)), and Galenic philosophers, and moving forward gracefully through Athanasius Kircher (Musurgia universalis (Rome, 1650)), Marin Mersenne (Harmonie universelle (Paris, 1636)), and Descartes (Passions de lâ€™aâ€œ me (Paris, 1649). He ends with the eighteenth-century theories of imitation generated by French critics such as Jean-Laurent Lecerf de laVieÂ¤ ville. In a book that covers so much territory, the arguments are necessarily condensed. But they are always perceptive. And whereas Palisca intentionally glosses over unresolved controversiesÃ§such as â€˜whether the church modes functioned in secular polyphonic music as they did in the sacred sphereâ€™ (p. 71)Ã§he does at least signal those matters still up for debate. The book is highly readable, with details relegated to ample footnotes. A handy appendix provides a chronological list of the principal treatises cited in the text. Primary sources are cited very fully in clear translations in the body of the text, with the original language in footnotes. Given that many of these works are not available in modern translation, Paliscaâ€™s book presents a valuable group of source readings with intelligent explanations. Although the book includes relatively few musical examples, Paliscaâ€™s knowledge of the repertory is always in evidence, and references to the compositions of Josquin, Orlando di Lasso, Claudio Monteverdi, and many others abound. Teachers will find in this book the dependability Palisca brought to the educational projects that engaged him at various points in his careerÃ§his Prentice-Hall textbook on Baroque Music, his editions of Donald J. Groutâ€™s History of Western Music, The Norton Anthology of Western Music he designed to accompany it, and dozens of articles for the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. For students new to sixteenthand seventeenth-century theory, it would serve nicely as a companion volume to The Norton Anthology. Specialists in other fields will find in this book a useful introduction to humanism and music (chs. 5 and 6), theories of dramatic music (ch. 7), and discussions of the role of the senses (ch. 3) and science (ch. 8) in the formulation of music theory. While a handful of scholars outside musicology have taken interest in early modern music theory (Ann Moyer, Timothy J. Reiss, and Downing Thomas, for instance), more often than not, music receives cursory or superficial treatment by those outside the discipline. Music and Ideas is a wonderful contribution to early modern studies, one that promises to broaden interest in music theory among those who work on the histories of science, politics, aesthetics, poetics, and philosophy. Paliscaâ€™s book is engaging reading for those who already know the subject, accessible to interested non-specialists, and indispensable for students. At a reasonable price, even in cloth, it deserves to make its way quickly into many classrooms and personal libraries.

The solution path of the generalized lasso,"We present a path algorithm for the generalized lasso problem. This problem penalizes the $\ell_1$ norm of a matrix D times the coefficient vector, and has a wide range of applications, dictated by the choice of D. Our algorithm is based on solving the dual of the generalized lasso, which greatly facilitates computation of the path. For $D=I$ (the usual lasso), we draw a connection between our approach and the well-known LARS algorithm. For an arbitrary D, we derive an unbiased estimate of the degrees of freedom of the generalized lasso fit. This estimate turns out to be quite intuitive in many applications.",2011,Annals of Statistics
Lead toxicity in seawater teleosts: A morphofunctional and ultrastructural study on the gills of the Ornate wrasse (Thalassoma pavo L.).,"Lead is one of the most alarming toxic pollutants for the environment due to its acute toxicity and high bioaccumulation tendency. Despite legislative efforts, world lead production has more than doubled since the early 1970s to 2016. Due to extensive exploitation and human activity, the coastal and estuarine regions belong to marine environments that are mostly and more rapidly deteriorated by pollutants including lead. A limited number of studies examined the effects of lead in fishes, compared to other aquatic models and even fewer studies have been dedicated to seawater fishes especially regarding Pb adsorption and accumulation in specific organs. Fish gills, key compartments involved in several crucial functions such as gas exchange, osmoregulation, and excretion, are also the organs in which Pb is mainly accumulated. Herein, we investigated the morphofunctional and ultrastructural modifications in the gills of a marine teleost (Thalassoma pavo) after acute exposure (48, 96, 192â€‰h) to three lead concentrations. We showed that pathological alterations can be detected in all the examined samples. The most common modifications observed were: the curling of the lamellae and the dilation of their apical tips, the lamellar edema, the proliferation and the hypertrophy of CCs, the progressive epithelial disorganization with detachment of the epithelium from connective tissue. This study also demonstrates that there is a weak influence on the expression pattern of Na+/K+-ATPase and AQP3 biomarker enzymes while high metallothioneins expression has been observed. The described alterations may adversely affect gas exchange and ionic balance, with a long chain of cascading effects. This is the first evidence of the effects exerted by lead on gills of seawater fishes that highlights the harmful properties of this metal, even at low concentration.",2019,Aquatic toxicology
"Simbiose de limpeza de Thalassoma Noronhanum (Boulenger, 1890) (Labridae) na reserva biolÃ³gica do Atol das Rocas, Rio Grande do Norte, Brasil","Cleaner fishes remove ectoparasites, injured tissue, mucus and scales from the body surface of other fishes. This habit is important for the maintenance and health of reef fish species. This cleaning interactions is known for about 100 species of fish, distributed in 19 families. The Noronha wrasse, Thalassoma noronhanum (Boulenger, 1890) is a reef-associated labrid endemic to the Brazilian coast, being regarded as a planktivore, a zoobenthivore, and a cleaner of several reef fishes. Was recorded cleaning 9 client fish species at Atol das Rocas Biological Reserve. The cleaning symbiosis occurred daily, between the 06:13 and 18:15h, in definitive and conspicuous places called stations of cleanness, having been more frequent the low tides. In the stations, the majority of the clients observed in the cleaning events was herbivores (66,7%), followed for the carnivores (22,3%) and planktivorous (11,0%).",2006,
An R Package flare for High Dimensional Linear Regression and Precision Matrix Estimation,"This paper describes an R package named flare, which implements a family of new high dimensional regression methods (LAD Lasso, SQRT Lasso, `q Lasso, and Dantzig selector) and their extensions to sparse precision matrix estimation (TIGER and CLIME). These methods exploit different nonsmooth loss functions to gain modeling flexibility, estimation robustness, and tuning insensitiveness. The developed solver is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is further accelerated by the multistage screening approach. The package flare is coded in double precision C, and called from R by a user-friendly interface. The memory usage is optimized by using the sparse matrix output. The experiments show that flare is efficient and can scale up to large problems.",2012,
On the l 1l q Regularized Regression,"In this paper we consider the problem of grouped variable selection in high-dimensional regression using `1-`q regularization (1 â‰¤ q â‰¤ âˆž), which can be viewed as a natural generalization of the `1-`2 regularization (the group Lasso). The key condition is that the dimensionality pn can increase much faster than the sample size n, i.e. pn Ã€ n (in our case pn is the number of groups), but the number of relevant groups is small. The main conclusion is that many good properties from `1-regularization (Lasso) naturally carry on to the `1-`q cases (1 â‰¤ q â‰¤ âˆž), even if the number of variables within each group also increases with the sample size. With fixed design, we show that the whole family of estimators are both estimation consistent and variable selection consistent under different conditions. We also show the persistency result with random design under a much weaker condition. These results provide a unified treatment for the whole family of estimators ranging from q = 1 (Lasso) to q = âˆž (iCAP), with q = 2 (group Lasso)as a special case. When there is no group structure available, all the analysis reduces to the current results of the Lasso estimator (q = 1).",2015,
Potential Environmental Factors Affecting Oil-Degrading Bacterial Populations in Deep and Surface Waters of the Northern Gulf of Mexico,"Understanding bacterial community dynamics as a result of an oil spill is important for predicting the fate of oil released to the environment and developing bioremediation strategies in the Gulf of Mexico. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the roles of temperature, water chemistry (nutrients), and initial bacterial community in selecting oil degraders through a series of incubation experiments. Surface (2 m) and bottom (1537 m) waters, collected near the Deepwater Horizon site, were amended with 200 ppm light Louisiana sweet crude oil and bacterial inoculums from surface or bottom water, and incubated at 4 or 24Â°C for 50 days. Bacterial community and residual oil were analyzed by pyrosequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. The results showed that temperature played a key role in selecting oil-degrading bacteria. Incubation at 4Â°C favored the development of Cycloclasticus, Pseudoalteromonas, Sulfitobacter, and Reinekea, while 24Â°C incubations enhanced Oleibacter, Thalassobius, Phaeobacter, and Roseobacter. Water chemistry and the initial community also had potential roles in the development of hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial communities. Pseudoalteromonas, Oleibacter, and Winogradskyella developed well in the nutrient-enriched bottom water, while Reinekea and Thalassobius were favored by low-nutrient surface water. We revealed that the combination of 4Â°C, crude oil and bottom inoculum was a key factor for the growth of Cycloclasticus, while the combination of surface inoculum and bottom water chemistry was important for the growth of Pseudoalteromonas. Moreover, regardless of the source of inoculum, bottom water at 24Â°C was a favorable condition for Oleibacter. Redundancy analysis further showed that temperature and initial community explained 57 and 19% of the variation observed, while oil and water chemistry contributed 14 and 10%, respectively. Overall, this study revealed the relative roles of temperature, water chemistry, and initial bacterial community in selecting oil degraders and regulating their evolution in the northern Gulf of Mexico.",2017,Frontiers in Microbiology
"Relationships Between Social, Physical, and Psychological Factors inÂ Older Persons: Frailty as an Outcome in Network Analysis.","OBJECTIVE
Frailty is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by social, physical, and psychological stressors. Network analysis is a graphical statistical technique that can contribute to the understanding of this complex, multifactorial phenomenon. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between social, physical, and psychological factors and frailty in older persons.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional study.


SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS
A total of 2588 community-dwelling older persons from the FIBRA (Frailty in Brazilian Older Persons) 2008 to 2009 study.


MEASURES
Participants were assessed for sociodemographic variables, physical and mental health, and the frailty phenotype. Partial correlation network analysis with the Graphical Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (glasso) estimator was performed to determine the relationships between social, physical, and psychological factors and frailty.


RESULTS
Mean participant age was 72.31Â years, 7.0% were frail, and 50.6% were prefrail. In the network structure, frailty correlated most strongly with physical and psychological factors such as diabetes and depression and exhibited greater proximity to physical factors such as disability, urinary incontinence, and cardiovascular risk as measured by waist-to-hip ratio.


CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
The analytical strategy used can provide information for specific subpopulations of interest and here confirmed that frailty is not uniformly determined but associated with different psychological and physical health factors, thereby allowing better understanding and management of this condition.",2020,Journal of the American Medical Directors Association
A new perspective on least squares under convex constraint,"Consider the problem of estimating the mean of a Gaussian random vector when the mean vector is assumed to be in a given convex set. The most natural solution is to take the Euclidean projection of the data vector on to this convex set; in other words, performing ""least squares under a convex constraint."" Many problems in modern statistics and statistical signal processing theory are special cases of this general situation. Examples include the lasso and other high-dimensional regression techniques, function estimation problems, matrix estimation and completion, shape-restricted regression, constrained denoising, linear inverse problems, etc. This paper presents three general results about this problem, namely, (a) an exact computation of the main term in the estimation error by relating it to expected maxima of Gaussian processes (existing results only give upper bounds), (b) a theorem showing that the least squares estimator is always admissible up to a universal constant in any problem of the above kind and (c) a counterexample showing that least squares estimator may not always be minimax rate-optimal. The result from part (a) is then used to compute the error of the least squares estimator in two examples of contemporary interest.",2014,Annals of Statistics
