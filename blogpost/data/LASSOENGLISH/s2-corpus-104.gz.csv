A Fast Algorithm for Detecting Gene-gene Interactions in Genome-wide Association Studies.,"With the recent advent of high-throughput genotyping techniques, genetic data for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become increasingly available, which entails the development of efficient and effective statistical approaches. Although many such approaches have been developed and used to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with complex traits or diseases, few are able to detect gene-gene interactions among different SNPs. Genetic interactions, also known as epistasis, have been recognized to play a pivotal role in contributing to the genetic variation of phenotypic traits. However, because of an extremely large number of SNP-SNP combinations in GWAS, the model dimensionality can quickly become so overwhelming that no prevailing variable selection methods are capable of handling this problem. In this paper, we present a statistical framework for characterizing main genetic effects and epistatic interactions in a GWAS study. Specifically, we first propose a two-stage sure independence screening (TS-SIS) procedure and generate a pool of candidate SNPs and interactions, which serve as predictors to explain and predict the phenotypes of a complex trait. We also propose a rates adjusted thresholding estimation (RATE) approach to determine the size of the reduced model selected by an independence screening. Regularization regression methods, such as LASSO or SCAD, are then applied to further identify important genetic effects. Simulation studies show that the TS-SIS procedure is computationally efficient and has an outstanding finite sample performance in selecting potential SNPs as well as gene-gene interactions. We apply the proposed framework to analyze an ultrahigh-dimensional GWAS data set from the Framingham Heart Study, and select 23 active SNPs and 24 active epistatic interactions for the body mass index variation. It shows the capability of our procedure to resolve the complexity of genetic control.",2014,The annals of applied statistics
Machine Learning of Lithium Diffusivity Dataset by Molecular Dynamics Simulations for Inorganic Oxide Crystals,"Toward development of next-generation all solid rechargeable batteries, it is essential to improve lithium ion conductivity of solid electrolytes. Attempts have been made to discover good lithium ionic conductor for decades. However, most of good solid-state conductors are non-oxides, mainly sulfides. No oxides are known which have sufficient ionic conductivity and wide electric window for practical use [1]. It seems very difficult to explore good oxide-based lithium ion conductors just by conventional trials-and-error ways from huge variety of chemical composition and structures. It should therefore be useful to construct a prediction model of ionic diffusivity from fundamental information of the compounds, such as chemical composition and crystal structure. In the group of the present authorsâ€™, theoretical prediction of the lithium conductivity of the LISICON type oxides was systematically made by combining a large set of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning of experimental data [2]. In the present study, we aim to expand the chemical compositional and structural space of target materials. We use empirical-potential molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations for various oxides in order to construct a database of lithium ion diffusivity (DLi), which is then applied to machine learning to construct a prediction model. Firstly, 797 ternary and quaternary compounds containing lithium and oxygen were taken from ICSD database (FIZ Karlsruhe). MD simulations were performed using Buckingham-type potentials implemented in the GULP code [3]. Simulation temperature was as high as 1600 K in order to reduce any atomic ordering effects. Time step was 5 fs and the total number of steps was 200,000 (1ns). Diffusion coefficient of each ion was then calculated. Some compounds were excluded from the dataset when diffusivity of other ions than lithium was noticed. We found that many of well-known lithium ionic conductors, for example Li0.62La1.12TiO3 (LLTO) and Li7La3Zr2O12 (garnet type) [1], show high DLi(1600K) by the present calculations. Secondary, we apply machine learning technique to all data in order to construct a prediction model. Logarithm of the diffusion coefficient, log DLi(1600K), was used as the target variable. Two types of descriptor set are considered. One contains variables related to crystalline density and composition, for example volume per atom and fraction of lithium. The other contains variables generated from partial radial distribution functions in addition to the former descriptor set. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) [4] is chosen to construct the prediction model. Using LASSO, descriptors can be reasonably selected. Figure 1 compares regression results for two descriptor sets. Root mean square (RMS) error is 0.27 for log DLi(1600K) with the second model, while it is 0.41 with the first model. This means the inclusion of the structural information notably improves the quality of the model.",2018,
"Politics , Institutions , and Trade âˆ— In","A vast literature on international trade predicts that political institutions affect both the choice of trade partners (extensive margin) and trade volumes (intensive margin). Yet most analyses ignore the former margin, while their estimates of the latter neglect nontrading pairs and thereby suffer from selection bias. Also, the data on individual features of multifaceted political institutions are highly collinear, which impedes estimating their separate effects. We develop and implement a two-stage Bayesian LASSO estimator that lets us use detailed measures of institutional features, with highly disaggregated product-level trade flows encompassing over one hundred and thirty countries over a half century. We find that political institutions matter more for the extensive than the intensive margin, and that democratic political institutions are not always trade promoting; although trade appears to be fostered by political stability, other features of democracies â€“ party competition and open executive recruitment â€“ inhibit trade.",2016,
Chemometrics and direct injection analysis of volatile compounds by PTR-TOF-MS: a tool for metabolomic investigations,"Sample classification and â€œexplanatoryâ€ variable selection is a cutting edge problem in metabolomics. Among direct injection methods for the detection of volatile compounds, Proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) is becoming more and more spread, especially after the coupling with time of flight detectors (PTR-TOF-MS). PTR-MS was proposed almost two decades ago for the rapid and high sensitivity monitoring of volatile compounds. It was immediately evident that food science and technology was one of its most interesting field of application given the role that volatile compounds play in food production, storage and consumption. We show that modern chemometric and data mining techniques, such as Random Forest, Partial Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, are well suited for addressing multiclass problems starting from fruit flavour profiles (by GC-MS) or fingerprints (by PTR-TOF-MS). Marker identification is successfully performed by recursive strategies such as Random Forest Recursive Feature Elimination. Moreover, regression methods, for instance LASSO and PLS, proved to be useful to link headspace, nose-space and sensory data from different analysis techniques. We present results from metabolomic studies by GC-MS and PTR-TOF-MS on i) raspberries: several cultivars having diverse levels of Botrytis susceptibility have been classified by the mentioned chemometric strategies and markers of Botrytis resistance have been identified; ii) apple cultivars and clones: markers for the discrimination of the apple clones based on their flavour profile have been identified; iii) grana cheeses and olive oils: we investigate the link between GC-MS profiles and PTR-TOF-MS fingerprint. Through these examples we will discuss the characteristics of the proposed strategy and show that it can provide a powerful tool for metabolomic.",2012,
Enumeration of Distinct Support Vectors for Model Selection,"In ordinary machine learning problems, the learning algorithm outputs a single model that optimizes its learning objective function, and doesnâ€™t consider the other models. In contrast, recently, some methods for enumerating multiple models are presented. For example, Hara and Maehara presented an algorithm for Lasso (AAAIâ€™17), while, Ruggieri for decision tree learning (ICMLâ€™17). In this paper, we extend the algorithm of Hara and Maehara, we present an efficient algorithm for the K-best model enumeration problem in the training of Support Vector Machines (SVM). This algorithm is, given a non-negative number K > 0, enumerating K-best models that have distinct support vectors in the descending order of the values of the objective function of SVM. By experiments on synthetic and real datasets, we evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm.",2018,
Application of Multi-task Lasso Regression in the Parametrization of Stellar Spectraâ˜†â˜†â˜†,"The multi-task learning approaches have attracted the increasing attention in the ï¬elds of machine learning, computer vision, and artiï¬cial intelligence. By utilizing the correlations in tasks, learning multiple related tasks simultaneously is better than learning each task independently. An efficient multi-task Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection and Operator) regression algorithm is proposed in this paper to estimate the physical parameters of stellar spectra. It not only can obtain the information about the common features of the different physical parameters, but also can preserve effectively their own peculiar features. Experiments were done based on the ELODIE synthetic spectral data simulated with the stellar atmospheric model, and on the SDSS data released by the American large-scale survey Sloan. The estimation precision of our model is better than those of the methods in the related literature, especially for the estimates of the gravitational acceleration (lg g) and the chemical abundance ([Fe/H]). In the experiments we changed the spectral resolution, and applied the noises with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) to the spectral data, so as to illustrate the stability of the model. The results show that the model is inï¬‚uenced by both the resolution and the noise. But the inï¬‚uence of the noise is larger than that of the resolution. In general, the multi-task Lasso regression algorithm is easy to operate, it has a strong stability, and can also improve the overall prediction accuracy of the model.",2015,Chinese Astronomy and Astrophysics
Abstract 2415: GBM exhibits phenotypic microheterogeneity and harbors pre-existing multi- resistant clones with a mesenchymal transition signature,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains in the group of incurable malignancies, with a median survival of 15 months. Intratumoral heterogeneity is a key factor driving relapse by providing the basis for escape of therapy-resistant cells. While the heterogeneous genomic and transcriptomic landscape of cancers is currently thoroughly characterized, phenotypic heterogeneity within tumors is less well understood. The overall goal in this study was to identify pre-existing treatment resistant clones with disease relapse potential and biomarkers linked to resistance vs sensitivity. To enable functional studies of isolated tumor clones we adopted an in vitro subcloning strategy. An adherent glioma neural stem cell culturing protocol was used to enrich for cells with stem-like properties and to permit efficient phenotypic screening. We established six libraries of clonal cell cultures from fresh GBM surgical specimens, corresponding to five different patient tumors. In all 708 clonal cultures were expanded. These were considered representatives of the self-renewing compartment within the tumor cell population. We found a remarkable variation in drug and radiation response within the clone libraries. A striking observation was that clones resistant to one drug, also tended to be resistant to most of the drugs we used, regardless of the drug9s mechanism of action. This indicates that resistance in large parts is mediated by a general mechanism. Most clones carried genetic aberrations that were unique or found only in a few clones but it was primarily the transcriptome data that demonstrated a clear link to the phenotypic data. A continuous gradient between multi-resistance and sensitivity was found to be connected to a gradual transition between a mesenchymal (MES), in resistant clones, and a more proneural (PN) and proliferative character in sensitive clones. The continuous distributions and lack of discrete groups in clonal response phenotypes and in linked signatures points to a general cell-state related resistance mechanism. We also found that resistant clones had a lower methylation level in promoters of known master regulators of MES subtype associated genes. This indicates that the phenotypic heterogeneity is driven by fluctuations in the epigenetic status. Taken together, our findings imply that intratumoral heterogeneity in GBM includes general clonal resistance mechanisms among glioma- initiating cells driven by epigenetic mechanisms. This evokes hope that new therapeutic approaches involving epigenetic reprogramming can be applied to sensitize cells toward conventional treatment.

Beyond â„“1-norm minimization for sparse signal recovery,"Sparse signal recovery has been dominated by the basis pursuit denoise (BPDN) problem formulation for over a decade. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that outperforms BPDN in finding sparse solutions to underdetermined linear systems of equations at no additional computational cost. Our algorithm, called WSPGL1, is a modification of the spectral projected gradient for â„“1 minimization (SPGL1) algorithm in which the sequence of LASSO subproblems are replaced by a sequence of weighted LASSO subproblems with constant weights applied to a support estimate. The support estimate is derived from the data and is updated at every iteration. The algorithm also modifies the Pareto curve at every iteration to reflect the new weighted â„“1 minimization problem that is being solved. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that the sparse recovery performance of our algorithm is superior to that of â„“1 minimization and approaches the recovery performance of iterative re-weighted â„“1 (IRWL1) minimization of CandeÌ€s, Wakin, and Boyd, although it does not match it in general. Moreover, our algorithm has the computational cost of a single BPDN problem.",2012,2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)
Mandated Choice for Organ Donation-Reply,"In Reply. â€”Dr Block laments the large number of people waiting for organ transplants and urges ""[p]rompt institution of definitive policy."" Precisely because we share his concern we called for judicious trials of mandated choice, along with research to understand the empirical and ethical dimensions of donation decisions. Theoretical musings about individual autonomy and speculation about why families and health professionals behave as they do have served us poorly thus far. Drs Glasson and Orentlicher claim that we suggest that the Council supports financial incentives because they impose new legal liabilities. We made no such suggestion. We reported this implication of future contracts for organs because it is prominently mentioned by the most vigorous advocate of future contracts for organs, 1 and it was excluded from the Council's report. 2 We believe that physicians have a legitimate interest in knowing about such a significant implication of a policy being proposed",1995,JAMA
PENALIZED SELECTION OF VARIABLE CONTRIBUTING TO ENHANCED SEED YIELD IN MUNGBEAN (Vigna radiata L.),"Penalized regression methods for simultaneous variable selection and coefficient estimation have received a great deal of attention in recent years. Especially those based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), that involves penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients. The ordinary least square and LASSO methods were used for selection of most significant traits contributing towards seed yield in mungbean plants with 18 morphological and yield associated traits and to develop the prediction model . Bayesian information criterion was applied to choose minimum tuning parameter. Results indicated that dry weight biomass and harvest index were highly significant characters towards seed yield while days to maturity, days to flowering, number of nodes per plant, pods per plant and degree of indetermination had a significant affect on response variable. Based on the results, it was rational to conclude that high yield of mungbean crop could be obtained by selecting the breading materials with these important characters on seed yield.",2014,Pakistan Journal of Agricultural Sciences

Signal Enhancement of Cadmium in Lettuce Using Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy Combined with Pyrolysis Process,"Fast detection of heavy metals in lettuce is significant for food market regulation and the control of heavy metal pollution. Advanced methods like laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technology have been tried to determine the cadmium (Cd) content. To retard the negative effect of complex matrix composition from samples and improve quantitative performance of LIBS technology, the pyrolysis process combined with LIBS was adopted to determine the cadmium (Cd) content of lettuce. Adaptive iteratively reweighted penalized least squares (airPLS) was used to preprocess the LIBS spectra and solve the baseline drift. For multivariate linear regression based on the three selected Cd emission lines correlation coefficient in the prediction set Rp2 increased from 0.9154 to 0.9969, and the limit of detection (LOD) decreased from 9.1 mg/kg to 0.9 mg/kg after the pyrolysis process. The partial least squares (PLS) regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied to construct calibration models based on full spectra. In addition, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was implemented to choose limited lines to predict the Cd content. The PLS model with the pyrolysis process obtained the best results with Rp2 = 0.9973 and LOD = 0.8 mg/kg. The results indicated that the pyrolysis method could enhance the spectral signal of cadmium and thus significantly improve the analysis results for all the models. It is shown in this experiment that proper sample preprocessing could effectively amplify the Cd signal in LIBS and make LIBS measurement an efficient method to assess Cd contamination in the vegetable industry.",2019,Molecules

Evolution of the magnitude of stroke at the teaching hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso,"Background Strokes are more and more frequent in the world, particularly in Africa. The evolution of their magnitude remains still poorly documented in the context of Burkina Faso, particularly in Bobo-Dioulasso. That is why this study was conducted to clarify the epidemiology of stroke and its risk factors in order to raise the alarm. Objective Investigate the evolution of the magnitude of stroke and its risk factors at the Teaching Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso between 2009 and 2013. Methods It was a descriptive transversal type, retrospective collection, covering the period from January 1st 2009 to December 31st 2013. It focused on the medical records of adults admitted to hospital for stroke with (confirmed cases) or without brain scanner confirmation (not confirmed cases). Results The number of the included cases was 967. The average age was 61.06Â years more or less 14.35Â years, with a sex ratio of 1.58. They were on average 05.55% of admissions annually within the services involved in their care. Their number and their proportion among admissions have increased in overall during the period. Confirmed cases represented 34.23% of all the cases, with 38.37% of hemorrhagic strokes. When they had been well documented, the risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking and diabetes were found respectively in 75.80%, 22.46% and 07.46% of all cases. The frequency of arterial hypertension and diabetes had an overall growing trend also. Conclusion Strokes are more and more frequent in Bobo-Dioulasso, just like its main risk factors high blood pressure and diabetes. It is urgent to prevent the latter in order to reduce the extent of the stroke.",2017,Revue D Epidemiologie Et De Sante Publique
Improving Human-Robot Interaction through Interface Evolution,"In remote robot operations, the human operator(s) and robot(s) are working in different locations that are not within line of sight of each other. In this situation, the humanâ€™s knowledge of the robotâ€™s surroundings, location, activities and status is gathered solely through the interface. Depending on the work context, having a good understanding of the robotâ€™s state can be critical. Insufficient knowledge in an urban search and rescue (USAR) situation, for example, may result in the operator driving the robot into a shaky support beam, causing a secondary collapse. While the robotâ€˜s sensors and autonomy modes should help avoid collisions, in some cases the human must direct the robotsâ€˜ operation. If the operator does not have good awareness of the robotâ€™s state, the robot can be more of a detriment to the task than a benefit. The humanâ€™s comprehension of the robotâ€™s state and environment is known as situation awareness (SA). Endsley developed the most generally accepted definition for SA: â€œThe perception of elements in the environment within a volume of time and space [Level 1 SA], the comprehension of their meaning [Level 2 SA ] and the projection of their status in the near future [Level 3 SA]â€ (Endsley, 1988). Drury, Scholtz, and Yanco (2003) redefined this definition of situation awareness to make it mo re specific to robot operations, breaking it into five categories: human-robot awareness (the humanâ€™s understanding of the robot), human-human awareness, robot-human awareness (the robotâ€™s information about the human), robot-robot awareness, and the humansâ€™ overall mission awareness. In this chapter, we focus on two of the five types of awarene ss that relate to a case in which one human operator is working with one robot: human-robot awareness and the humanâ€™s overall mission awareness. Adams (2007) discusses the implications for human-unmanned vehicle SA at each of the three levels of SA (perception, comprehension, and projection). In Drury, Keyes, and Yanco (2007), human-robot awareness is further decomposed into five types to aid in assessing the operatorâ€™s understanding of the robot: location awareness, activity awareness, surroundings awareness, status awareness and overall mission awareness (LASSO). The two types that are primarily addressed in this chapter are location awareness and surroundings awareness. Location awareness is the operatorâ€™s knowledge of where the robot is situated on a larger scale (e.g., knowing where the robot is from where it started or that it is at a certain point on a map). Surroundings awareness is the knowledge the operator has of the robotâ€™s circumstances in a local sense, such as when there is an",2010,
Existence d'un Ã©quilibre de Nash dans un jeu discontinu,"In this paper, we present a more simple and independent proof of Reny's theorem (1998), on the existence of a Nash equilibrium in discontinue game, with a better-reply secure game in a Hausdorff topological vector space stronger than Reny's one. We will get the equivalence if the payoff function is upper semi-continuous like in the second Reny's example. Our proof is based on a new version of the existence of maximal element of Fan-Browder given by Deguire and Lassonde (1995). Reny's proof used a lemma of approximation of payoff function by a continuous sequence and show the existence of Nash equilibrium by the existence of equilibrium in mixed strategy proved in continuous game by the classical result.",2005,

For three days T. ciliatum was exposed to Diuron, Fusillade (Forte) and 2, 4-D amine, either individually or in combination. The toxic effects were investigated by measuring the effective quantum yield through rapid light curves and the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), before and after exposure at intervals of 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hrs. During the recovery phase both Fv/Fm and effective quantum yield were measured after 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hrs. Results revealed an inhibition of both ETRmax and Fv/Fm after diuron exposure. No effect on ETRmax and Fv/Fm were observed when T. ciliatum was exposed to Fusilade Forte and 2, 4-D amine. Any combination of the herbicides that involved Diuron showed inhibition both in ETRmax and Fv/Fm. Exposure to a combination of Fusilade Forte and 2,4-D amine had no effect on both ETRmax and Fv/Fm of T. ciliatum. It is concluded that, diuron is toxic to T. ciliatum at a concentration which can be found in a polluted environment while the other herbicides did not show inhibition of the parameters measured.

Effectiveness of horizontal personal sound systems for listeners of variable heights,"Standard surround systems for generation of isolated wideband soundfields employ uniformly-spaced array of speakers in the horizontal plane. For these systems, the evaluation of sound reproduction with height is important due to listener's variable heights. Previous work demonstrated that controlling both the speakers' location and their complex weights using two-stage Lasso-LS pressure matching optimization allows isolated sound reproduction with limited number of speakers within the speakers' plane. This work demonstrates that deployment of this technique can also give up to 24dB in suppression of sound at heights between zero and one meter from speakers' plane over single-stage LS using e.g. 90 speakers in a semicircular array.",2013,"2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing"
Opatija: Spa Tradition Transforming into Modern Health Tourism?,"When it comes to tradition, there are few Croatian seaside resorts that could compete with Opatija. However, it would be wrong to think that the story about Opatija starts with tourism. Actually, the town had had a long and intriguing history before the first guests and caterers arrived. The first mention of the abbey of St. Jacob (the contemporary name of the town, Opatija, is a Croatian word for â€œabbeyâ€) can be found in the Liber civilium sive notificationum of the Rijeka notary Antonio de Renno de Mutina, and is dated May 1439 (1). For the next hundred years, the abbey was owned by the Benedictine order and protected by an agreement with the authorities of the nearby town of Kastav. After the abbey had passed into the hands of the Augustine order from Rijeka, at about the mid of the 16th century, Kastav allowed the first families to settle the margins of the abbey land. The inflow of settlers from the nearby hills, but also from Friuli, Istria, Dalmatia, Montenegro, Italy, Slovenia, and Austria has not ceased since (2). 
 
The transformation of a fishermenâ€™s and sailorsâ€™ village into a seaside health resort began in the late 1830s with the â€œdiscoveryâ€ of Opatija by Iginio Scarpa, a rich and influential merchant from Rijeka, who arrived to Opatija by the then new coastal road. Scarpa, amazed by the vegetation and peace, bought a terrain and built a villa (or reconstructed an existing building), called Angiolina after his deceased wife. The guests of the Scarpa family included an Austrian ex-emperess, Croatian vice-roy Jelacic, and the botanist Noe, as well as some of the great medical authorities of the time, who gave their contribution to the spread of Opatija's fame. Leopold Schrotter Kristelli, the founder of the first Laryngology Chair in Vienna, proved the beneficial effects of the high concentrations of sea aerosol in the air of Opatija; Robert Virchow was amazed by the subtropical vegetation; Bavarian Max Joseph Ortel, the founder of diphtheria spore and laryngostroboscope, initiated the arrangement of a wide net of wood paths, intended and carefully gauged for cardiac rehabilitation patients; Theodor Billroth promoted Opatija in his famous letters and chose it even for his temporary residence and death; Julius Glax, the then European top authority in balneology, accepted the offer of Friedrich Schulerâ€™s Sudbahn Gesellschaft and became the president of the Opatija Health-Resort Committee. Opatija was officially proclaimed Kurort (spa) in 1889. The result of these promotion activities was that, within some thirty years, Opatija became the second most visited resort in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, ranked only after Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary). By 1914, seven sanatoria and two institutes became active, as well as five open sea baths, and several closed facilities offering the modern hydrotherapeutic procedures (3). 
 
Even the first Opatija's hotel, the Quarnero (Kvarner, opened in 1884) was originally designed to be a sanatorium for the â€œchest-diseasedâ€ (4). Very soon about 1888, the Quisisana of Ignaz Schwarz and the Army-Officers' Sanatorium (K.u.k. Offizier-Kurhaus) were opened in the Slatina area (about 1888) (5). Shortly before the end of the 19th century, the Hungarian doctor Kalman SzegÅ‘ opened a sanatorium on the other side of the town. The SzegÅ‘ Sanatorium included four buildings â€“ sanatorium for adults; childrenâ€™s sanatorium (with 30 rooms); building with medical studios, x-ray apparatus, laboratory and a play hall; and a gymnastic hall with sunbathing space (6). Other sanatoria were run by Dr Mahler (for heart diseased), Dr Schalk, and others. Dr Stephan Isor Stein, in his sanatorium, opened in 1904, offered something different â€“ his Zander Institute, aimed for the therapy by particularly designed system of muscular exercises (7). 
 
The main therapy in the majority of the sanatoria and many private boarding houses, however, was based on hydropathic procedures. Five open public sea baths were arranged: Tomasevac (probably around 1883), Angiolina-Bad (lost in fire in 1989), Crnikovica (during the Italian era, Bagno dei Legionari), Slatina Bad (lost in a storm in 1979), and Quitta Bad (sacrificed in 1981 for the construction of the Admiral Hotel). In 1902, the first closed public bath, Ludwig Viktor Bad, was opened in the center of the town. The building was equipped with a 10â€‰Ã—â€‰15 m swimming pool (connected by a glass corridor with the Stephanie Hotel â€“ now the Imperial Hotel), combined-baths devices, such as Scotch shower and vibratory massage, baths with extracts (Extract-Bader), two-cell baths (Zweizellen-Bader), carbon-acid baths (Kohlen-Saure-Bader), sitting baths (Sitz-Bader), cold procedures, electric and light baths, and others. In the attic, the reservoirs with cold, warm, and sea water were stored (8). 
 
Water was not used only to dip in it; the ancient practice of drinking spa water was also continued. The Bavarian Professor M. J. Ortel launched the idea that â€œone has to drink cold water until he has too much, and bath in it until he becomes blueâ€ (Kaltwassertrinken bis zum Ubermas und Kaltwasserbaden bis zum Verblauen). Dietetic cures, advertised in Opatija were the kefir cure (against constipation), the milk cure (in acute and chronic renal diseases), and the grapes cure (Traubenkuren: up to 3 kg grapes per day, as a diuretic and purgative, as well as a cure for intestinal and gall-bladder diseases (2). 
 
Pneumatic inhalation was also applied, as well as inhalation of oxygen, sea aerosol, and etheric oils. Facilities in Opatija also provided treatment with thorium- and radium-isotope rays, x-rays, UV and blue light, Finsen phototherapy, darsonvalization, gymnastics, and all kinds of massage. The concept of â€œwalking therapy,â€ designed by Munde and Ortel, was introduced, consisting of short walks, which were sometimes combined with swimming but never too exhaustive or taken immediately after meal. The paths all around Opatija were precisely marked, graded, and various itineraries recommended to various categories of heart disease convalescents (9). 
 
There were also those who invented â€œcold water,â€ such as the Opatija practitioner Geza Fodor, Assistant Professor at the Pest University. Fodor prepared a commercial cocktail of an attractive name â€“ Marina â€“ actually made of nothing but filtered, sterilized, and CO2-impregnated sea water. An entire â€œphilosophyâ€ was developed on how Marina should be diluted with sweet water, added to milk, how long it should be drunk before or after meal, how it can be used warm to treat diarrhea, or at room temperature in other cases, or how it is efficient in treating diabetes or tuberculosis. Other Opatija's original preparations were mostly promoted by pharmacists, like Erenyi's Diana Franzbranntwein, Sternbach's Ovol tablets, or the Laurol preparation (10). 
 
Altogether, about sixty physicians, mostly highly specialized professionals from Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Poland, Bohemia, and Romania started their medical practice in Opatija. Emergency service (Rettungsgesellschaft) was organized in 1894, thanks to Dr Jaromir von Mundy, only eleven years after such practice was established in Vienna. The Opatija Golden Book of Guests testifies on the visits of emperors, kings, dukes, Nobel-prize winners, and dozens of well-known names from politics and arts (5). 
 
The â€œItalian Era,â€ lasting from 1918 until 1943, brought significant stagnation to Opatija. The 1930s showed signs of the restoration of tourism, but these lasted too briefly. After the Second World War and post-war difficulties, other type of guests started arriving to Opatija. A second golden era in the health resort came in the 1960s with Prof. Cedomil Plavsicâ€™s cardio-rehabilitation programs, which once again attracted the world medical authorities to Opatija's new hospital institution â€“ Thalassotherapia. In 1998, this institution became the Croatian Ministry of Health Referal Center for Health Tourism (2). 
 
A general opinion prevails that tradition is a blessed source of wealth and ideas, but tradition can also be viewed as a burden imposing architectonic, economic, and many other limitations, and often (too) high quality standards. Modern Opatija is faced with precisely this kind of dilemma and it will depend on the visionary capacities of local planners whether the richness of Opatija's tradition will be used as the foundation for the town's future, or the heritage will perish, opening place for new, developmental strategies which are not based on tradition. Both modern marketing and modern medicine impose the need for quick and continuous re-adjustments in health tourism. Tradition, on the other hand, offers an inexhaustible source of ideas and solutions that make the crucial difference between a successful and an unsuccessful destination.",2007,Croatian Medical Journal
2 Logistic Group Lasso 2 . 1 Model Setup,"The Group Lasso is an extension of the Lasso to do variable selection on (predefined) groups of variables in linear regression models. The estimates have the attractive property of being invariant under groupwise orthogonal reparametrizations. We extend the Group Lasso to logistic regression models and present an efficient algorithm, especially suitable for high-dimensional problems, which can also be applied to generalized linear models to solve the corresponding convex optimization problem. The Group Lasso estimator for logistic regression is shown to be statistically consistent even if the number of predictors is much larger than sample size but with sparse true underlying structure. We further use a two-stage procedure which aims for sparser models than the Group Lasso, leading to improved prediction performance for some cases. Moreover, due to the two-stage nature, the estimates can be constructed to be hierarchical. The methods are used on simulated and real datasets about splice site detection in DNA sequences.",2007,
A further analysis of robust regression modeling and data mining corrections testing in global stocks,"In this analysis of the risk and return of stocks in global markets, we build a reasonably large number of stock selection models and create optimized portfolios to outperform a global benchmark. We apply robust regression techniques, LAR regression, and LASSO regression modeling to estimate stock selection models. Markowitz-based optimization techniques is used in portfolio construction within a global stock universe. We apply the Markowitzâ€“Xu data mining corrections test to a global stock universe. We find that (1) robust regression applications are appropriate for modeling stock returns in global markets; (2) weighted latent root regression robust regression techniques work as well as LAR and LASSO-Regressions in building effective stock selection models; (3) meanâ€“variance techniques continue to produce portfolios capable of generating excess returns above transactions costs; and (4) our models pass several data mining tests such that regression models produce statistically significant asset selection for global stocks. Recent Sturdy-Regression modeling technique may offer the greatest potential for further research for statistically based stock selection modeling.",2020,Annals of Operations Research

Efficient Estimation of Pathwise Differentiable Target Parameters with the Undersmoothed Highly Adaptive Lasso,"We consider estimation of a functional parameter of a realistically modeled data distribution based on observing independent and identically distributed observations. We define an $m$-th order Spline Highly Adaptive Lasso Minimum Loss Estimator (Spline HAL-MLE) of a functional parameter that is defined by minimizing the empirical risk function over an $m$-th order smoothness class of functions. We show that this $m$-th order smoothness class consists of all functions that can be represented as an infinitesimal linear combination of tensor products of $\leq m$-th order spline-basis functions, and involves assuming $m$-derivatives in each coordinate. By selecting $m$ with cross-validation we obtain a Spline-HAL-MLE that is able to adapt to the underlying unknown smoothness of the true function, while guaranteeing a rate of convergence faster than $n^{-1/4}$, as long as the true function is cadlag (right-continuous with left-hand limits) and has finite sectional variation norm. The $m=0$-smoothness class consists of all cadlag functions with finite sectional variation norm and corresponds with the original HAL-MLE defined in van der Laan (2015). 
In this article we establish that this Spline-HAL-MLE yields an asymptotically efficient estimator of any smooth feature of the functional parameter under an easily verifiable global undersmoothing condition. A sufficient condition for the latter condition is that the minimum of the empirical mean of the selected basis functions is smaller than a constant times $n^{-1/2}$, which is not parameter specific and enforces the selection of the $L_1$-norm in the lasso to be large enough to include sparsely supported basis. We demonstrate our general result for the $m=0$-HAL-MLE of the average treatment effect and of the integral of the square of the data density. We also present simulations for these two examples confirming the theory.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
NETS: Network Estimation for Time Series,"This work proposes novel network analysis techniques for multivariate time series. We define the network of a multivariate time series as a graph where vertices denote the components of the process and edges denote non zero long run partial correlations. We then introduce a two step LASSO procedure, called NETS, to estimate high dimensional sparse Long Run Partial Correlation networks. This approach is based on a VAR approximation of the process and allows to decompose the long run linkages into the contribution of the dynamic and contemporaneous dependence relations of the system. The large sample properties of the estimator are analysed and we establish conditions for consistent selection and estimation of the non zero long run partial correlations. The methodology is illustrated with an application to a panel of U.S. bluechips.",2018,Journal of Applied Econometrics
Machine Learning-Based Financial Statement Analysis,"This paper explores the application of machine learning methods to financial statement analysis. We investigate whether a range of models in the machine learning repertoire are capable of forecasting the sign and magnitude of abnormal stock returns around earnings announcements based on financial statement data alone. We find random forests and recurrent neural networks to outperform deep neural networks and linear models such as OLS and Lasso. Using the models' predictions in an investment strategy we find that random forests dominate all other models and that non-linear methods perform relatively better for predictions of extreme market reactions, while the linear methods are relatively better in predicting moderate market reactions. Analysing the underlying economic drivers of the performance of the random forests, we find that the models select as most important predictors accounting variables commonly used to forecast free cash flows and firm characteristics that are known cross-sectional predictors of stock returns.",2020,
Optimal decisions with multiple agents of varying performance,"In this dissertation, I look at four distinct systems that all embody a similar challenge to modeling complex scenarios from noisy multidimensional historical data. In many scenarios, it is important to form an opinion, make a prediction, implement a business decision, or make an investment based upon expected future system behavior. All systems embody an amount of uncertainty, and quantify- ing that uncertainty using statistical methods, allows for better decision making. Three distinct scenarios are discussed with novel application of statistical methods to best quantify the endogenous uncertainty and aid in optimal decision making. Two chapters focus on predicting the winners of a horse race, one on predicting movement of a stock index, and the fourth on molding response from an online advertising effort. The first horse racing chapter uses a hierarchical Bayesian approach to model- ing running speed, using a novel grouping of races into ""profiles"" and then pooling information across those profiles to improve predictive accuracy. The second horse racing chapter implements a novel conditional logistic regression that is modified by frailty parameter derived from winning payoff, and then regularized with a LASSO. High speed parallel algorithms, running on a GPU, were hand coded to optimize tuning LASSO parameters in rapid time. The chapter on stock index prediction explores the application of ensemble filters. I show how an ensemble of filters on individual member stocks is a better predictor of index direction than a filter directly on the index. The chapter on advertising explores how the clicks and sales from an Ad- Words campaign may be modeled with a re-paramaterized Beta distribution to better capture variance. Empirical data from a live campaign is studied, with a hierarchical Bayesian framework for brand features solved using a Metropolis within Gibbs algorithm.",2013,
"Soil Nutrient Detection for Precision Agriculture Using Handheld Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Multivariate Regression Methods (PLSR, Lasso and GPR)","Precision agriculture (PA) strongly relies on spatially differentiated sensor information. Handheld instruments based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) are a promising sensor technique for the in-field determination of various soil parameters. In this work, the potential of handheld LIBS for the determination of the total mass fractions of the major nutrients Ca, K, Mg, N, P and the trace nutrients Mn, Fe was evaluated. Additionally, other soil parameters, such as humus content, soil pH value and plant available P content, were determined. Since the quantification of nutrients by LIBS depends strongly on the soil matrix, various multivariate regression methods were used for calibration and prediction. These include partial least squares regression (PLSR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (Lasso), and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The best prediction results were obtained for Ca, K, Mg and Fe. The coefficients of determination obtained for other nutrients were smaller. This is due to much lower concentrations in the case of Mn, while the low number of lines and very weak intensities are the reason for the deviation of N and P. Soil parameters that are not directly related to one element, such as pH, could also be predicted. Lasso and GPR yielded slightly better results than PLSR. Additionally, several methods of data pretreatment were investigated.",2020,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)"
"Exact post-selection inference, with application to the lasso","We develop a general approach to valid inference after model selection. In a nutshell, our approach produces post-selection inferences with the same frequency guarantees as those given by data splitting but are more powerful. At the core of our framework is a result that characterizes the distribution of a post-selection estimator conditioned on the selection event. We specialize the approach to model selection by the lasso to form valid condence intervals for the selected coecients and test whether all relevant variables have been included in the model.",2016,Annals of Statistics
2007 guideline for the management of ureteral calculi.,"TheAmericanUrologicalAssociationNephrolithiasis Clinical Guideline Panel was established in 1991. Since that time, the Panel has developed three guidelines on the management of nephrolithiasis, the most recent being a 2005 update of the original 1994 Report on the Management of Staghorn Calculi [1]. The European Association of Urology began their nephrolithiasis guideline project in 2000, yielding the publication of Guidelines on Urolithiasis, with updates in 2001 and 2006 [2]. While both documents provide useful recommendations on the management of ureteral calculi, changes in shock-wave lithotripsy technology, endoscope design, intracorporeal lithotripsy techniques, and laparoscopic expertise have burgeoned over the past five to ten years. Under the sage leadership of the late Dr. JosephW. Segura, the AUA Practice Guidelines Committee suggested to both the AUA and the EAU that they join efforts in developing the first set of internationally endorsed guidelines focusing on the changes introduced in ureteral stone management over the last decade. We therefore dedicate this report to the memory of Dr. Joseph W. Segura whose vision, integrity, and perseverance led to the establishment of the first international guideline project. This joint EAU/AUA Nephrolithiasis Guideline Panel (hereinafter the Panel) performed a systematic review of the English language literature published since 1997 and a comprehensively analyzed outcomes data from the identified studies. Based on their findings, the Panel concluded that when removal becomes necessary, SWL and ureteroscopy remain the two primary treatment modalities for the management of symptomatic ureteral calculi. Other treatments were reviewed, including medical expulsive therapy to facilitate spontaneous stone passage, percutaneous antegrade ureteroscopy, and laparoscopic and open surgical ureterolithotomy. In concurrence with the previously published guidelines of both organizations, open stone surgery is still considered a secondary treatment option. Blind basketing of ureteral calculi is not recommended.

Sampling for Estimation of Catch Composition in Bering Sea Trawl Fisheries,"uses the NOAA Technical Memorandum series to issue informal scientific and technical publications when complete formal review and editorial processing are not appropriate or feasible. Documents within this series reflect sound professional work and may be referenced in the formal scientific and technical literature. Management of groundfish fisheries in Alaska is based on annual, seasonal, or fishery-and vessel-specific catch limits. Limits include both total allowable catch quotas for major species and incidental catch limits for many non-target species, including prohibited species such as Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). Fisheries are managed in near-real time based on industry reports and data collected by at-sea observers. Estimates of both the total catch for sampled hauls and the species composition of individual hauls are based on randomly selected samples collected by observers. The precision and accuracy of observer sampling are, therefore, of considerable importance to both industry and regulators of these fisheries. Accuracy of sample composition estimates is particularly critical where total catch is estimated for individual vessels or small fleet sectors; variability in estimates can have large effects on catch accounting. We present results of two studies conducted in the eastern Bering Sea aboard commercial trawl catcher/processors. These two studies had three common goals: 1) To evaluate alternatives for selection of catch composition samples, 2) To check for possible biases associated with sample selection, and 3) To estimate the precision of catch composition estimates based on selected samples. The first study, conducted in 1999 aboard the FV American No. 1, used modified standard observer sample collection methods and looked for evidence of mechanical sorting or stratification of species during net retrieval and catch handling aboard the vessel. Samples for this study were selected systematically throughout the haul. These sample-based catch estimates were compared to catch estimates based on processed catch product for targeted species, and to censuses of catch for non-target species. For this study, target species included walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), yellowfin sole (Limanda iii aspera), flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon), and Alaska plaice (Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus). Non-target species included in the study were Pacific halibut, skates (Raja sp. and Bathyraja sp.), Tanner crab (Chinoecetes bairdi), snow crab (Chinoecetes opilio), and red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus). The second study, aboard the FV Seafisher in 2005, tested an automated catch sampling and monitoring system as a means to limit mechanical sorting and to remove potential bias from the sample selection process. â€¦",2009,
Comparison of Univariate and Multivariate Calibration Methods for Geological Trace Elements with Handheld Xrf,"Introduction: Laboratory x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy is a reliable and established technique in geochemical analysis. Recently, handheld XRF (hXRF) spectrometers have become available, and their capacity for rapid, in situ analysis has great potential for use in both Earth and planetary science. However, available technology focuses on mining and industrial applications, and is not yet well-suited for geochemistry. Moreover, calibration techniques that work well for high resolution lab XRF may not be as well-suited for the handheld units. Currently, there are few hXRF calibration curves that relate spectral intensity to element concentration for geologically relevant elements and matrices. To realize the full potential of hXRF for planetary science, expanded calibration curves based on geological standards are needed. Here we present preliminary results of univariate and multivariate analysis (MVA) methods to create calibration curves for trace elements with the Olympus Innov-X DELTA Premium hXRF. Samples and Methods: Samples used in this study were pressed powder pellets from the collections of rock powder standards in the Mount Holyoke College Mineral Spectroscopy Laboratory [1]. About 600 samples in this collection are different rock types doped with up to 10 wt.% of varying trace elements [24]; remaining samples are previously-studied rock powders from various localities. In this study, 805 samples were analyzed using the Olympus DELTA Premium hXRF. The instrument fires two beams on each run, with Beam 1 for heavy element analysis and Beam 2 for light element analysis, resulting in a total of 1610 spectra. Elements studied are listed in Table 1. Univariate. PolyReg-CV, a web interface (http://bregman.cs.umass.edu:5693), was used to create univariate calibrations with â‰¤ 3 polynomial degrees; cross-validated leave one out root mean square errors (LOO RMSE-CV) were then calculated. Univariate calibrations were based on the area of an elementâ€™s KÎ± peak using the Summed Area algorithm [6]. L-Î± and M-Î± peaks were also analyzed for heavy elements. Multivariate. The lab website Project Superman [6] (nemo.cs.umass.edu:54321) was used to process the data and create multivariate calibrations. Only spectra with concentrations of the element at close to naturally-occurring levels (typically <5000 ppm) were included in calibrations. Both Lasso [7] and Partial Least Squares (PLS) [8] models were considered. To determine the most relevant channels on the spectrum for predicting element concentration, a Lasso model was trained with Î± = 1000 and the coefficients were plotted along the spectrum, as shown in Figure 1 for Ga. The higher the absolute value of the coefficient (ratioed to the intensity at that channel), the more important that channel is to the calibration. Through trial and error modeling, peaks occurring near those critical channels were used to determine which combination of spectral ranges yielded calibrations with the lowest LOO RMSE-CV. Results and Discussion: Univariate models consistently yielded lower errors, although multivariate models occasionally prevailed (Table 1). When multivariate models were more accurate than univariate models, however, it was often by a small margin, while univariate models surpassed multivariate models sometimes by more than 300% (Figure 2).

"Views of women and men in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, on three forms of female genital modification","Abstract This paper is about how female circumcision/female genital mutilation (FC/FGM) was viewed by women and men aged 18â€“89 in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, now that it has been against the law for almost 15 years. The findings come from 11 months of field research, participant observation and interviews in 2008. The practice of FC/FGM was an important issue in Bobo-Dioulasso, even though prevalence seems to be falling. The most important argument for continuing it was not a traditional role, but the need to control female sexuality â€“ regarded as very active â€“ not to negate it, but to ensure morally acceptable behaviour. When I talked about female genital cosmetic surgery it emerged that Bobolaise women used various substances to enhance sexual pleasure for men, both to keep the relationship and to protect the gifts and money many women needed to survive and for their children. FC/FGM was seen as a socio-cultural obligation, necessary to achieve a respectable status. Other forms of genital modification were seen as a means of satisfying male sexual needs, though vaginal tightening to hide sexual experience was also a way of demonstrating respectability. What emerged overall is that Bobolaises had their own perspectives about all the forms of female genital modification that were discussed. RÃ©sumÃ© Cet article dÃ©crit l'idÃ©e que les femmes et les hommes Ã¢gÃ©s de 18â€“89 ans se font de l'excision/la mutilation sexuelle fÃ©minine Ã  Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, alors qu'elle est dÃ©sormais illÃ©gale depuis prÃ¨s de 15 ans. Ces conclusions proviennent d'une recherche de terrain de 11 mois, d'observation participante et d'entretiens en 2008. La mutilation sexuelle fÃ©minine Ã©tait un problÃ¨me important Ã  Bobo-Dioulasso, mÃªme si sa prÃ©valence semble diminuer. L'argument le plus important pour la poursuivre n'Ã©tait pas son rÃ´le traditionnel, mais la nÃ©cessitÃ© de contrÃ´ler la sexualitÃ© fÃ©minine, considÃ©rÃ©e trÃ¨s active, non pas de la nier, mais de garantir un comportement moralement acceptable. Quand j'ai parlÃ© de chirurgie plastique des organes gÃ©nitaux fÃ©minins, il est apparu que les Bobolaises utilisaient diffÃ©rentes substances pour augmenter le plaisir masculin, Ã  la fois dans le but de garder leur partenaire et conserver les cadeaux et l'argent dont beaucoup de femmes ont besoin pour survivre et pour leurs enfants. La mutilation sexuelle fÃ©minine Ã©tait considÃ©rÃ©e comme une obligation socioculturelle, nÃ©cessaire pour jouir d'un statut respectable. D'autres formes de modification gÃ©nitale Ã©taient jugÃ©es comme un moyen de satisfaire les besoins sexuels masculins, mÃªme si le rÃ©trÃ©cissement vaginal pour cacher l'expÃ©rience sexuelle Ã©tait aussi une maniÃ¨re pour la femme de dÃ©montrer sa respectabilitÃ©. Il est apparu dans l'ensemble que les Bobolaises avaient leurs propres opinions sur toutes les formes de modification gÃ©nitale fÃ©minine Ã©voquÃ©es. Resumen En este artÃ­culo se examina la manera en que la circuncisiÃ³n femenina/mutilaciÃ³n genital femenina (CF/MGF) era vista por mujeres y hombres de 18 a 89 aÃ±os de edad, en Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, ahora que ha sido ilegal por casi 15 aÃ±os. Los hallazgos provienen de 11 meses de investigaciÃ³n en el campo, observaciÃ³n participante y entrevistas realizadas en 2008. La prÃ¡ctica de CF/MGF era un asunto importante en Bobo-Dioulasso, aunque la prevalencia parece haber disminuido. El argumento mÃ¡s importante para continuarla no era su funciÃ³n tradicional, sino la necesidad de controlar la sexualidad femenina â€“ considerada como muy activa â€“ no negarla, pero sÃ­ asegurar comportamiento moralmente aceptable. Cuando hablÃ© sobre cirugÃ­a cosmÃ©tica de los genitales femeninos, resultÃ³ que las mujeres de Bobolaise utilizaban diversas sustancias para realizar el placer sexual de los hombres, tanto para mantener la relaciÃ³n como para proteger los regalos y el dinero que muchas mujeres necesitaban para sobrevivir y para sus hijos. La CF/MGF era vista como una obligaciÃ³n sociocultural, necesaria para lograr una condiciÃ³n social respetable. Otras formas de modificaciÃ³n genital eran consideradas un medio de satisfacer las necesidades sexuales del hombre, aunque apretar la vagina para ocultar la experiencia sexual tambiÃ©n era una manera de demostrar respetabilidad. En general, se determinÃ³ que las personas de Bobolaise tenÃ­an sus propias perspectivas sobre todas las formas de modificaciÃ³n genital femenina discutidas.",2010,Reproductive Health Matters
Sparse Semiparametric Nonlinear Model with Application to Chromatographic Fingerprints.,"Traditional Chinese herbal medications (TCHMs) are comprised of a multitude of compounds and the identification of their active composition is an important area of research. Chromatography provides a visual representation of a TCHM sample's composition by outputting a curve characterized by spikes corresponding to compounds in the sample. Across different experimental conditions, the location of the spikes can be shifted, preventing direct comparison of curves and forcing compound identification to be possible only within each experiment. In this article we propose a sparse semiparametric nonlinear modeling framework for the establishment of a standardized chromatographic fingerprint. Data-driven basis expansion is used to model the common shape of the curves while a parametric time warping function registers across individual curves. Penalized weighted least squares with the adaptive lasso penalty provides a unified criterion for registration, model selection, and estimation. Furthermore, the adaptive lasso estimators possess attractive sampling properties. A back-fitting algorithm is proposed for estimation. Performance is assessed through simulation and we apply the model to chromatographic data of rhubarb collected from different experimental conditions and establish a standardized fingerprint as a first step in TCHM research.",2014,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Two-stage variable selection for molecular prediction of disease,"A two-stage predictor strategy is introduced in the context of high dimensional data (large p, small n). Here the focus application is a medical one: prediction of symptomatic infection given molecular expression levels in blood. The first stage of the two-stage predictor uses the previously introduced method of Predictive Correlation Screening (PCS) to select a subset of genes that are important in the prediction of symptom scores. Selected genes are used in the second stage to learn a predictor for the prediction of symptom scores. Under sampling budget constraints we derive the optimal sample allocation rules to the first and second stages of the two-stage predictor. Superiority of the proposed predictor relative to the well known method of LASSO is shown via experiment.",2013,2013 5th IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)
Inferring regulatory networks using a hierarchical Bayesian graphical Gaussian model,"In this paper, we propose a new formalism based on graphical Gaussian model (GGM) to infer genetic regulatory networks. A hierarchical Bayesian prior for the precision matrix of the GGM is introduced to impose a bias toward sparse graph structure. We show that the MAP estimation of the undirected graph can be readily obtained by a variant of the well-known Lasso regression algorithm. Then we integrate the estimated graph with the â€œCHIp-Chipâ€ protein-binding location data to infer the regulatory networks using a post-processing algorithm. Compared to extant Bayesian network (BN) models for similar tasks, our formalism captures statistical dependencies among genes that are more prevalent and plausible in the biological system. Our approach is also capable of modeling partial correlations between mRNA levels and therefore goes beyond clustering-based approaches. We applied our method to an expression microarray data (more than 6000 genes) together with a genome-wide location analysis data (more than 100 TFs). Evaluated on the consistency with the GO annotations, our method achieves a significantly better performance than clustering and BN learning algorithms in discovering genetic regulatory modules.",2005,

The Genesis of the Transcendental: How to make a Realist Speculation out of Absolute Idealism,"Continental philosophy has recently been shaken by the so called â€œspeculative realismâ€ movement. What is actually at stake in this philosophical tendency is a â€œspeculative turnâ€, trying to access the real as the condition of both our conditioned knowledge and the existence of subject-independent objects. Accordingly, speculative realism tries to provide a non-idealist solution to the typically post-Kantian problem of the genesis of the transcendental. In the first part of this paper I will show how Quentin Meillassoux, Ray Brassier, Iain Hamilton Grant â€“ three of the participants of the workshop that gave â€œSpeculative Realismâ€ its name on April 2007 at Goldsmith University of London â€“ propose to overcome the circle of correlation, specifically in the form created by Fichte, so as to access the in-itself as a reality which is completely independent of thought, while being able to ground the possibility of its existence. In the second part I will compare their different strategies and consider some issues that, in my opinion, are problematical as non-correlationist solutions. Finally, in the last part, I will propose a rough account of the direction that I mean to take towards solving the problem of the genesis of the transcendental.",2015,
Optimizing Trait Predictability in Hybrid Rice Using Superior Prediction Models and Selective Omic Datasets,"Hybrid breeding has dramatically boosted yield and its stability in rice. Genomic prediction further benefits rice breeding by increasing selection intensity and accelerating breeding cycles. With the rapid advancement of technology, other omic data, such as metabolomic data and transcriptomic data, are readily available for predicting genetic values (or breeding values) for agronomically important traits. In the current study, we searched for the best prediction strategy for four traits (yield, 1000 grain weight, number of grains per panicle and number of tillers per plant) of hybrid rice by evaluating all possible combinations of omic datasets with different prediction methods. We conclude that, in rice, the predictions using the combination of genomic and metabolomic data generally produce better results than single-omics predictions or predictions based on other combined omic data. Inclusion of transcriptomic data does not improve predictability possibly because transcriptome does not provide more information for the trait than the sum of genome and metabolome; rather, the computational complexity is substantially increased if transcriptomic data is included in the models. Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) appears to be the most efficient prediction method compared to the other commonly used approaches, including LASSO, SSVS, SVM-RBF, SVP-POLY and PLS. Our study has provided a guideline for selection of hybrid rice in terms of which types of omic datasets and which method should be used to achieve higher trait predictability.",2018,bioRxiv
Comparison of iterated single-step and Bayesian regressions on genomic evaluations for age at 100 kg in swine.,"The effects of modified single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) iterations on GEBV and SNP were investigated using 85,388 age at 100 kg phenotypes from the BRF SA breeding program Landrace pure line animals, off-tested between 2002 and 2013. Pedigree data comprised animals born between 1999 and 2013. A total of 1,068 animals were assigned to the training population, in which all of them had genotypes, original and corrected age at 100 kg phenotypes, and weighted deregressed proof records. A total of 100 genotyped animals, with high accuracy age at 100 kg estimated breeding values, were assigned to the validation population. After applying the quality control workflow, a set of 41,042 SNP was used for the analysis. Standard and modified ssGBLUP, BayesCÏ€, and Bayesian Lasso were compared, and their predictive abilities were accessed by approximate true and GEBV correlations. Modified ssGBLUP iteration effects on SNP estimates and GEBV were relevant, in which assigned differential weights and shrinkage caused important losses on ssGBLUP predictive ability for age at 100 kg GEBV. Even though ssGBLUP accuracy can be equal or better than the compared Bayesian methods, additional gains can be obtained by correctly identifying the number of iterations required for best ssGBLUP performance.",2015,Journal of animal science
A generalized Dantzig selector with shrinkage tuning,"The Dantzig selector performs variable selection and model fitting in linear regression. It uses an L 1 penalty to shrink the regression coefficients towards zero, in a similar fashion to the lasso. While both the lasso and Dantzig selector potentially do a good job of selecting the correct variables, they tend to overshrink the final coefficients. This results in an unfortunate trade-off. One can either select a high shrinkage tuning parameter that produces an accurate model but poor coefficient estimates or a low shrinkage parameter that produces more accurate coefficients but includes many irrelevant variables. We extend the Dantzig selector to fit generalized linear models while eliminating overshrinkage of the coefficient estimates, and develop a computationally efficient algorithm, similar in nature to least angle regression, to compute the entire path of coefficient estimates. A simulation study illustrates the advantages of our approach relative to others. We apply the methodology to two datasets. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.",2009,Biometrika
Estimating Dynamic Functional Brain Connectivity With a Sparse Hidden Markov Model,"Estimating dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) of the brain from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can reveal both spatial and temporal organization and can be applied to track the developmental trajectory of brain maturity as well as to study mental illness. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is regarded as a promising task since it reflects the spontaneous brain activity without an external stimulus. The sliding window method has been successfully used to extract dFNC but typically assumes a fixed window size. The hidden Markov model (HMM) based method is an alternative approach for estimating time-varying connectivity. In this paper, we propose a sparse HMM based on Gaussian HMM and Gaussian graphical model (GGM). In this model, the time-varying neural processes are represented as discrete brain states which are described with functional connectivity networks. By enforcing the sparsity on the precision matrix, we can get interpretable connectivity between different functional regions. The optimization of our model can be realized with the expectation maximization (EM) and graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (glasso) algorithms. The proposed model is validated on both simulated blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) time series and rs-fMRI data. Results indicate that the proposed model can capture both stationary and abrupt brain activity fluctuations. We also compare dFNC patterns between children and young adults from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) study. Both spatial and temporal behavior of the dFNC are analyzed and compared. The results provide insight into the developmental trajectory across childhood and motivate further research on brain connectivity.",2020,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
Fish community structure on coral habitats with contrasting architecture in the Tropical Eastern Pacific,"Reefscape architecture, shaped by dominant coral morphologies, can play a major role in determining the structure and composition of fish assemblages by affecting niche and resource availability and mediating interspecific interactions. To explore the role of dominant coral morphologies on reef fish communities, we carried out a comparative study of the fish community associated with a Massive Coral Community (MCC) and a Branching Coral Community (BCC) at Gorgona Island, Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP). On each community, the benthic substrate was assessed through the â€œchain transect methodâ€ while the fish assemblage was evaluated through visual surveys on belt transects. We found differences between both fish assemblages in terms of the abundance, diversity ( Hâ€™ ), and evenness (J â€™ ). The BCC, despite being formed by morphologically complex pocilloporid colonies, had a simple and relatively flat architecture that attracted principally small and territorial fishes. Significant higher abundances ofÂ  Chromis atrilobataÂ  andÂ  Thalassoma lucasanum Â at the BCC boosted the total fish abundance but caused low fish evenness and diversity. Conversely the MCC, composed of massive coral species with considerable sizes and diversity of shapes, held a complex and high-relief reefscape capable of sustaining a more diverse and even fish community, although with the same species richness as the BCC. Fishes with large sizes, roving behavior and piscivore-feeding preferences were especially attracted to the MCC. Although, massive coral species are important in determining a diverse and complex reefscape architecture, both dominant coral morphologies (massive and branching) attract and provide resources to different types of fish according to their size, mobility and trophic group. Our results suggest that a loss of massive coral species and a community shift towards stress-resistant taxa (such asÂ  PocilloporaÂ  spp. ) , could alter the structure and function of fish assemblages in the TEP due to the habitat loss for large, mobile and piscivore species.

Total chemical synthesis of lassomycin and lassomycin-amide.,Herein we report a practical synthetic route to the lasso peptide lassomycin () and C-terminal variant lassomycin-amide (). The biological evaluation of peptides and against Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed that neither had any activity against this bacterium. This lack of biological activity has led us to propose that naturally occurring lassomycin may actually exhibit a standard lasso peptide threaded conformation rather than the previously reported unthreaded structure.,2016,Organic & biomolecular chemistry
From Convenient Ally To Right-Hand Man: Christian-Muslim Alliances In the Legend of Bernardo del Carpio,"Abstract:One of the ubiquitous features of the legend of Bernardo del Carpio is the hero's presence in the defeat of Charlemagne's troops at Roncesvalles, often in alliance with Marsilio, Muslim King of Zaragoza. Lucas de Tuy's Chronicon mundi (c. 1239) is the first textual witness to Bernardo's participation in the battle, with Rodrigo JimÃ©nez de Rada, the anonymous author of the Poema de FernÃ¡n GonzÃ¡lez, and Alfonso X's chroniclers making similar connections. Later authors continue to link Bernardo to Roncesvalles, with poets such as Gabriel Lobo Lasso de la Vega dedicating several romances to the battle. However, despite rather consistent representations of Bernardo's participation in the battle, descriptions of the Muslim army's role vary widely. The present study analyzes how thirteenth-and sixteenth-century chroniclers and authors manipulated the Muslim presence in the battle of Roncesvalles according to their overarching purposes, ideologies, and cultural milieus.",2017,"La corÃ³nica: A Journal of Medieval Hispanic Languages, Literatures, and Cultures"
Untrained acquisition of /s/ in a phonologically disordered child.,"The untrained /s/ productions of a phonologically disordered child were followed over a period of several months as she produced /s/ in imitated words and in spontaneous connected speech. For this child, as has been reported in the literature for children acquiring phonology normally, /s/ occurred earliest in the word-final position, appearing in word-initial position only several weeks later. Two word-medial, or intervocalic, contexts were compared: (a) monomorphemic words in which /s/ is word- and morpheme-medial (e.g., lasso); and (b) bimorphemic words in which /s/ is word-medial but morpheme-final (e.g., missing). In this latter group, a grammatical inflection or morpheme was added to a morpheme that ends with /s/. Correct responses to the intervocalic position where /s/ occurred at a morpheme boundary (i.e., in inflected morphemes) occurred earlier and more frequently than responses to single-morpheme intervocalic position. The variability of the child's productions over time is examined and discussed.",1984,The Journal of speech and hearing disorders

The LASSO risk: asymptotic results and real world examples,"We consider the problem of learning a coefficient vector x0 âˆˆ â„N from noisy linear observation y = Ax0 + w âˆˆ â„n. In many contexts (ranging from model selection to image processing) it is desirable to construct a sparse estimator $\hat x$. In this case, a popular approach consists in solving an l1-penalized least squares problem known as the LASSO or Basis Pursuit DeNoising (BPDN). 
 
For sequences of matrices A of increasing dimensions, with independent gaussian entries, we prove that the normalized risk of the LASSO converges to a limit, and we obtain an explicit expression for this limit. Our result is the first rigorous derivation of an explicit formula for the asymptotic mean square error of the LASSO for random instances. The proof technique is based on the analysis of AMP, a recently developed efficient algorithm, that is inspired from graphical models ideas. 
 
Through simulations on real data matrices (gene expression data and hospital medical records) we observe that these results can be relevant in a broad array of practical applications.",2010,
Sparse Oracle Inequalities for Variable Selection via Regularized Quantization,"We give oracle inequalities on procedures which combines quantization and variable selection via a weighted Lasso $k$-means type algorithm. The results are derived for a general family of weights, which can be tuned to size the influence of the variables in different ways. Moreover, these theoretical guarantees are proved to adapt the corresponding sparsity of the optimal codebooks, if appropriate. Even if there is no sparsity assumption on the optimal codebooks, our procedure is proved to be close to a sparse approximation of the optimal codebooks, as has been done for the Generalized Linear Models in regression. If the optimal codebooks have a sparse support, we also show that this support can be asymptotically recovered, giving an asymptotic upper bound on the probability of misclassification. These results are illustrated with Gaussian mixture models in arbitrary dimension with sparsity assumptions on the means, which are standard distributions in model-based clustering.",2014,arXiv: Statistics Theory
A differential-geometric approach to generalized linear models with grouped predictors,"We propose an extension of the differential-geometric least angle regression method to perform sparse group inference in a generalized linear model. An efficient algorithm is proposed to compute the solution curve. The proposed group differential-geometric least angle regression method has important properties that distinguish it from the group lasso. First, its solution curve is based on the invariance properties of a generalized linear model. Second, it adds groups of variables based on a group equiangularity condition, which is shown to be related to score statistics. An adaptive version, which includes weights based on the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence, improves its variable selection features and is shown to have oracle properties when the number of predictors is fixed.",2016,Biometrika

Efficacy and safety of mass cataract surgery campaign in a developing country.,"PURPOSE
To determine the visual outcomes achieved in terms of efficacy and safety during a mass eye surgery campaign in a low-income developing country.


METHODS
Three hundred fifteen eyes of 305 patients underwent extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation in a prospective, analytical, experimental, and nonrandomized study on patients who underwent cataract surgery during the campaign that two Spanish nongovernmental organizations conducted in December 2008 in a district hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso).


RESULTS
Mean age was 61.97 Â± 14.39 years. The mean uncorrected distance visual acuity before surgery was 2.17 Â± 0.7 (20/3000), which improved to 0.86 Â± 0.64 logMAR (20/150) 3 months after cataract surgery. The mean spherical equivalent at 3 months was -0.87 Â± 1.90 diopters. The corrected distance visual acuity was 0.52 Â± 0.44 logMAR (20/60) 3 months after surgery, 68.7% of the patients had good visual outcomes, and 9.16% had poor outcomes. A total of 41.4% of the operated eyes showed a spherical equivalent within Â± 1.00 diopter of emmetropia. The most common intraoperative complication was posterior capsule rupture (incidence, 2.9%, 9 of 315), and the most serious complication was expulsive hemorrhage (incidence, 0.3%, 1 of 315). Three months after surgery, 2.9% (9 of 315) of the eyes was affected by posterior capsular opacity.


CONCLUSIONS
A mass cataract campaign performed in a developing country with the proper technique and standardized protocols of action improved the visual outcome of the patients. The rate of incidence of extracapsular extractions is comparable to that estimated for developed countries.",2013,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry
Measuring nonclassical correlations of two-photon states,"RCPTM, Joint Laboratory of Optics of Palacky University andInstitute of Physics of Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic,17. listopadu 12, 772 07 Olomouc, Czech Republic(Dated: May 30, 2013)The threshold between classical and nonclassical two-qubit states is drawn at the place whenthese states can no longer be described by classical correlations, i.e., quantum discord or entangle-ment appear. However, to check if the correlations are classical (in terms of quantum discord andentanglement) it is sucient to witness the lack of quantum discord because its zero value impliesthe lack of entanglement. We explain how the indicator of quantum discord introduced by Girolamiand Adesso [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 150403 (2012)] can be practically measured in linear-opticalsystems using standard beam splitters and photon detectors. We study the eciency of the setupassuming both ideal and real components and show that the eciency of the proposed implemen-tation is better than the full two-photon quantum tomography. Thus, we demonstrate that a classof experiments previously available on NMR platform can be implemented in optical systems.",2013,Physical Review A
"Waste Not, Want Not: A Case of a Terrible Triad Injury of the Elbow Where a Non Salvageable Radial Head Was Used as a Source of Bone Graft for a Contra Lateral Intra-Articular Distal Radius Fracture","We present a case of a 37 year old male who sustained bilateral upper limb injuries following a mountain biking accident. He sustained a terrible triad injury of the elbow on the left side and an intra-articular distal radius fracture on the right side. The elbow was reduced emergently and placed in a backslab on the day of injury. There was a two week delay before definitive treatment could be carried out. The terrible triad injury was treated with a suture lasso technique to the coronoid fragment, a radial head excision and arthroplasty and a lateral collateral ligament reconstruction. The excised radial head was used as a source of bone graft and used to fill the intra-articular defect on the contra-lateral side in the distal radius using a K wire and plaster immobilisation. Although by no means unique we believe this case highlights an important point to remind surgeons that in multiply injured patients where some of their own bone needs to be excised it can be used as a valuable source of autograft for other injuries.",2017,Orthopedics and Rheumatology Open access Journal
Improved Model-Free Gait Recognition Based on Human Body Part,"Gait recognition aims to identify people through the analysis of the way they walk. The challenge of model-free based gait recognition is to cope with various intra-class variations such as clothing variations, carrying conditions, and angle variations that adversely affect the recognition performance. This chapter proposes a method to select the most discriminative human body part based on group Lasso of motion to reduce the intra-class variation so as to improve the recognition performance. The proposed method is evaluated using CASIA gait database (dataset B), and the experimental results suggest that our method yields 88.75 % of Correct Classification Rate (CCR) when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.",2017,
Analyses and applications of optimization methods for complex network reconstruction,"Abstract Inferring the topology of a network from observable dynamics is a key topic in the research of complex network. With the observation error considered, the topology inferring is formulated as a connectivity reconstruction problem that can be solved through optimization estimation. It is found that the different optimization methods should be selected to deal with the different degrees of noise, different scales of observable time series and such other situations when it comes to the problem of connectivity reconstruction, which has not been analyzed and discussed before yet. In this paper, four regression methods, namely least squares, ridge, lasso and elastic net, are used to solve the problem of network reconstruction in different situations. In particular, a further analysis is made of the effects of each regression method on the network reconstruction problem in detail. Through simulation of a variety of artificial and real networks, as it has turned out, the four regression methods are effective in respect to network reconstruction when certain conditions are respectively satisfied. Based on the experimental results, it is possible to reach some interesting conclusions that can guide our readers to know the internal mechanisms for network reconstruction and choose the appropriate regression method in accordance with the actual situation and existing knowledge.",2020,Knowl.

MiRNA expression patterns are associated with tumor mutational burden in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Background: Tumor mutational burden (TMB) has emerged as an independent biomarker to predict patient responses to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a crucial role in the regulation of anticancer immune responses, but the association of miRNA expression patterns and TMB is not clear in LUAD. Methods: Differentially expressed miRNAs in samples with high TMB and low TMB samples were screened in the LUAD dataset in The Cancer Genome Atlas. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was applied to develop a miRNA-based signature classifier for predicting TMB levels in the training set. An test set was used to validate this classifier. The correlation between the miRNA-based classifier index and the expression of three immune checkpoints (PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4) were explored. Functional enrichment analysis was carried out of the miRNAs included in the miRNA-based signature classifier. Results: Twenty-five differentially expressed miRNAs were used to establish a miRNA-based signature classifier for predicting TMB level. The accuracy of the 25-miRNA-based signature classifier was 0.850 in the training set, 0.810 in the test set and 0.840 in the total set. This miRNA-based signature classifier index showed a low correlation with PD-1 and PD-L1, and no correlation with CTLA-4. Enrichment analysis for these 25 miRNA revealed they are involved in many immune-related biological processes and cancer-related pathways. Conclusion: MiRNA expression patterns are associated with tumor mutational burden and a miRNA-based signature classifier may serve as a biomarker for prediction of TMB levels in LUAD.",2019,Oncoimmunology
Genetic control of tracheid properties in Norway spruce wood,"âž¢ Through the use of genome-wide association (GWAS) mapping it is possible to establish the genetic basis of phenotypic trait variation. Our GWAS study presents the first such an effort in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L). Karst.) for the traits related to wood tracheid characteristics. âž¢ The study employed an exome capture genotyping approach that generated 178 101 high quality Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from 40 018 probes within a population of 517 Norway spruce mother trees. We applied a LASSO based association mapping method using a functional multi-locus mapping approach that utilizes latent traits, with a stability selection probability method as the hypothesis testing approach to determine significant Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs). Expression of the identified candidate genes was examined using publicly available spruce databases. âž¢ The analysis have provided 31 loci and 26 mostly novel candidate genes, majority of which showing specific expression in wood-forming tissues or high ubiquitous expression, potentially controlling tracheids dimensions, their cell wall thickness and microfibril angle. Among most promising candidates, the analysis identified Picea abies BIG GRAIN 2 (PabBG2) with predicted function in auxin transport and sensitivity, and MA_373300g0010 - similar to wall-associated receptor kinases (WAKs), both associated to cell wall thickness. âž¢ The results demonstrate feasibility of GWAS to identify novel candidate genes controlling industrially-relevant tracheid traits in Norway spruce. The presence of many traits with several significant QTLs supports the notion that the majority of these traits are polygenic in nature.",2019,bioRxiv
Hierarchy-Debug: a scalable statistical technique for fault localization,"Considering the fact that faults may be revealed as undesired mutual effect of program predicates on each other, a new approach for localizing latent bugs, namely Hierarchy-Debug, is presented in this paper. To analyze the vertical effect of predicates on each other and on program termination status, the predicates are fitted into a logistic lasso model. To support scalability, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to cluster the predicates according to their presence in different executions. Considering each cluster as a pseudo-predicate, a distinct lasso model is built for intermediate levels of the hierarchy. Then, we apply a majority voting technique to score the predicates according to their lasso coefficients at different levels of the hierarchy. The predicates with relatively higher scores are ranked as fault relevant predicates. To provide the context of failure, faulty sub-paths are identified as sequences of fault relevant predicates. The grouping effect of Hierarchy-Debug helps programmers to detect multiple bugs. Four case studies have been designed to evaluate the proposed approach on three well-known test suites, Space,Â Siemens, and Bash. The evaluations show that Hierarchy-Debug produces more precise results compared with prior fault localization techniques on the subject programs.",2013,Software Quality Journal
Diversity and Abundance of Oil-Degrading Bacteria and Alkane Hydroxylase (alkB) Genes in the Subtropical Seawater of Xiamen Island,"In this report, the diversity of oil-degrading bacteria and alkB gene was surveyed in the seawater around Xiamen Island. Forty-four isolates unique in 16S rRNA sequence were obtained after enrichment with crude oil. Most of the obtained isolates exhibited growth with diesel oil and crude oil. alkB genes were positively detected in 16 isolates by degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR). And for the first time, alkB genes were found in bacteria of Gallaecimonas, Castellaniella, Paracoccus, and Leucobacter. Additional 29 alkB sequences were retrieved from genomic DNA of the oil-degrading communities. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the obtained alkB genes formed five groups, most of which exhibited 60â€“80% similarity at the amino acid level with sequences retrieved from the GenBank database. Furthermore, the abundance of alkB genes in seawater was examined by real-time PCR. The results showed that alkB genes of each group in situ ranged from about 3â€‰Ã—â€‰103 to 3â€‰Ã—â€‰105 copies Lâˆ’1, with the homologs of Alcanivorax and Pseudomonas being the most predominant. Bacteria of Alcanivorax, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas are important oil degraders in this area; while those frequently reported in other area, like Oleiphilus spp., Oleispira spp., and Thalassolituus spp. were not found in our report. These results indicate that bacteria and genes involved in oil degradation are quite diverse, and may have restriction in geographic distribution in some species.",2010,Microbial Ecology
Robust group lasso: Model and recoverability,"Abstract This paper considers the problem of recovering a group sparse signal matrix Y = [ y 1 , â‹¯ , y L ] from sparsely corrupted measurements M = [ A ( 1 ) y 1 , â‹¯ , A ( L ) y L ] + S , where A ( i ) 's are known sensing matrices and S is an unknown sparse error matrix. A robust group lasso (RGL) model is proposed to recover Y and S through simultaneously minimizing the l 2 , 1 -norm of Y and the l 1 -norm of S under the measurement constraints. We prove that Y and S can be exactly recovered from the RGL model with high probability for a very general class of A ( i ) 's.",2018,Linear Algebra and its Applications
Development of a statistical model for discrimination of rupture status in posterior communicating artery aneurysms,"BackgroundIntracranial aneurysms at the posterior communicating artery (PCOM) are known to have high rupture rates compared to other locations. We developed and internally validated a statistical model discriminating between ruptured and unruptured PCOM aneurysms based on hemodynamic and geometric parameters, angio-architectures, and patient age with the objective of its future use for aneurysm risk assessment.MethodsA total of 289 PCOM aneurysms in 272 patients modeled with image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were used to construct statistical models using logistic group lasso regression. These models were evaluated with respect to discrimination power and goodness of fit using tenfold nested cross-validation and a split-sample approach to mimic external validation.ResultsThe final model retained maximum and minimum wall shear stress (WSS), mean parent artery WSS, maximum and minimum oscillatory shear index, shear concentration index, and aneurysm peak flow velocity, along with aneurysm height and width, bulge location, non-sphericity index, mean Gaussian curvature, angio-architecture type, and patient age. The corresponding area under the curve (AUC) was 0.8359. When omitting data from each of the three largest contributing hospitals in turn, and applying the corresponding model on the left-out data, the AUCs were 0.7507, 0.7081, and 0.5842, respectively.ConclusionsStatistical models based on a combination of patient age, angio-architecture, hemodynamics, and geometric characteristics can discriminate between ruptured and unruptured PCOM aneurysms with an AUC of 84%. It is important to include data from different hospitals to create models of aneurysm rupture that are valid across hospital populations.",2018,Acta Neurochirurgica
The relationship between mass spectrometry bacterial markers and percentage of weight loss during detoxification therapy programs,"Objective: to assess the relationship between mass spectrometry markers of microbiota and the percentage of weight loss during detoxification therapy programs. We investigated 20 middle-aged patients who were enrolled in 7-days detoxification programs in Kivach clinic (Russia,Karelia). Besides performing routing clinical tests we evaluated patients' microbiota using blood mass spectrometry assay before starting the treatment. Detoxification therapy included indirect tubeless liver and gallbladder cleansing with choleretic herbal medicines; colon cleansing using hardware techniques and probiotics; improvement of excretory function of kidneys using phytopreparations; infra-red sauna and thalassotherapy; aquatic exercise; enteral sorption; action on the lymphatic drainage by physiotherapy techniques and phytopreparations. The percentage of weight loss during the detoxification therapy program varied from 1.6% to 5.2%. This parameter wasnâ€™t related to age and body mass index of patients. Meanwhile, the percentage of weight loss correlated inversely with the serum levels of mass spectrometry markers of Clostridium ramosum (Spearmen's correlation coefficient, rs=-0.465,p=0.045), Clostridium perfringens (rs=-0.489,p=0.033), Clostridium coccoides (rs=-0.574,p=0.010), Prevotella (rs=-0.607,p=0.006), Actinomyces viscosus (rs=-0.466,p=0.044) and bacterial plasmalogen (rs=-0.467,p=0.044). The results of the study suggest that the increase in Clostridium ramosum, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium coccoides, Prevotella and Actinomyces viscosus markers is associated with lower percentage of weight loss during detoxification therapy programs.",2016,Journal of International Society of Microbiota
Pigments and Iodine Content of Some Seagrasses along the Egyptian Red Sea Coast,"Pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and p-carotene) and iodine concentrations were determined in five species of seagrasses (Halophila stipulacea, Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis. Thalassodendron ciliatum and Thalassia hemprichii) collected from sixteen sites along the Red Sea, Gulf of Aqaba and Suez Gulf. Chlorophyll a has the highest average concentration of pigments investigated (5.066 mg/lOOgm), while very low contents of P-carotene with an average of 0.0004 mg/lOOgm were recorded, The minimum concentrations of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and P-carotene were recognized at Ras Abu Somah site, while the maximum was found at El Kafrawy Project (12.158 mg/lOOgm) H. stipulacea had the highest values of Chlorophyll a, while H. Uninervis had the highest concentration of Chlorophyll b (10.918 mg/100gm): High significant correlation was found between Chlorophyll a and Chlorophyll, b (r = 0.779). Low iodine contents were found in the investigated seagrass species, ranged from 0.021 for T. ciliatum to 0.038 g/lOOgm for H. uninervis, with an average of 0.031 g/lOOgm. The highest mean of iodine contents within seagrasses species was recorded in T. hemprichiL while their lowest mean was recognized in T. ciliatyjci&fExcQpX for the highest reading of T. ciliatum (0.026 g/lOOgm) at Ras Burkha (Gulf of Aqaba), all the minimum and maximum values of iodine in the studied seagrasses were recorded at the Red Sea Proper sites.",2007,Egyptian journal of aquatic biology and fisheries
Homo Africanus: Antiquus or Oeconomicus? Some Interpretations of African Economic History,"We are referring to interpretations which, especially during the 1950s and 1960s, have focused on the nature of the economic process within so-called ""primitive"" societies (the antiquus argument), and the extent to which conventional economic theory can be applied in the study of them (the oeconomicus argument). The present interpretations are related to an earlier controversy about the ""true nature"" of the economies of antiquity, which began to emerge from as early as 1864-67, when Karl Rodbertus' Economic Life in Classical Antiquity appeared. In his ""modern"" analysis, Rodbertus argued that a monetarized economy required a different social structure from that of an economy in kind. In 1941, Michael Rostovtzeffs Social and Economic History of the Hellenistic World (Oxford, 1941), another book in the ""moder"" genre, reinforced the earlier view by suggesting that ""the difference between the economic life of this [Hellenistic] period and that of the modern world is only quantitative not qualitative"" (p. 335). Before Rostovtzeff's book, however, the issue had already been joined by the publication of Karl Biicher's Die Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft (Tubingen: Verlag der H. Lauppschen, 1893), which linked economic life in the ancient world to primitive (antiquus) economies. Since then, the controversy has considered the antiquus arguments of Bronislaw Malinowski, Argonauts of the Western Pacific (New York: E. P. Dutton & Co., 1922), and Richard Thurwald, Economics in Primitive Communities (Oxford University Press, 1932) on the one hand; and the oeconomicus analyses of Firth and Herskovits etc., on the other hand. During the 1960s, the debate continued mainly between George Dalton, one of the main proponents of the antiquus tradition, and his opponents in Current Anthropology and the American Anthropologist. For a review of the main issues see Raymond Firth, ed., Themes in Economic Anthropology (London: Tavistock, 1967); Edward E. LeClaire and Harold K. Schneider, eds., Economic Anthropology: Readings in Theory and Analysis (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1968); and throughout this article. Recently, voices of the French structuralist, neo-Marxist economic anthropologists have been added to the debate. See for example, Maurice Godelier, Rationalite et Irrationalite en Economie (Paris: Frangois Maspero, 1966); Horizon, Trajets Marxistes en Anthropologie (Paris: Francois Maspero, 1973); and Claude Meillassoux, ""Essai d'Interpretation de Ph6nomene Economique dans les Societes Traditionnelles d'Auto-Subsistance,"" Cahiers d'Etudes Africaines, no. 4 (Dec. 1960), 38-67, and throughout this article.",1977,Comparative Studies in Society and History
Geopolitical transformations in the Caucasian-Caspian region,"eopolitics, the major theoretical propositions of which were formulated in detail in the 19th20th centuries by its founding fathers (Ratzel, Kjellen, Mackinder, Mahan, Spykeman, Haushoffer, Schmitt, and others), is based on the fundamental dualism of Tellurocracy (Land) and Thalassocracy (Sea) as two opposing ontological and epistemological concepts. â€œLand,â€ â€œTellurocracy,â€ or â€œSupremacy on the Landâ€ as a paradigmatic matrix of a wide variety of civilizations is associated with stable spaces and their quality orientations and descriptions realized in the domination of the whole over parts, conservatism, hierarchy, and strict legal norms which rule large human communities: clans, tribes, peoples, states, and empires. â€œSea,â€ â€œThalassocracy,â€ or â€œSupremacy on the Seaâ€ is a civilizational type based on the domination of parts over the whole, individualism, liberalism, relative ethnic and legal norms, and the priority of nomadism and seafaring over the settled way of life. â€œMarine culturesâ€ develop and change their external features easily while preserving the inner identity of their basic principles. The larger part of human history has been unfolding under conditions of small-scale confrontation between the state-territorial units of both orientations. Whereby this dualism was concentrated along sea coasts and at river mouths and basins (Rome vs. Carthage, Sparta vs. Athens, etc.). By the beginning of the Christian era, political forms and improved technical transportation means created a stable geopolitical picture of the world, which Halford Mackinder depicted on his map. â€œLandâ€ became associated with the inland expanses of Northeast Eurasia (which coincided, on the whole, with the territory occupied consecutively by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, the â€œThird Romeâ€), while â€œSeaâ€ was identified with the coastal zones of the Eurasian continent and the New World colonized by the European maritime powers during the Age of Geographic Discoveries (the Anglo-Saxon world, â€œNew Carthageâ€). The war of position that filled the 18th and 19th centuries with its geopolitical content was waged by Thalassocratic Britain against continental powers",2005,Central Asia and the Caucasus
Late effects in head and neck radiotherapy Development of a multivariable normal tissue complication probability ( NTCP ) model for tube feeding dependence after curative radiotherapy / chemo-radiotherapy in head and neck cancer,"Background and purpose: Curative radiotherapy/chemo-radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) may result in severe acute and late side effects, including tube feeding dependence. The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to develop a multivariable normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model for tube feeding dependence 6 months (TUBEM6) after definitive radiotherapy, radiotherapy plus cetuximab or concurrent chemoradiation based on pre-treatment and treatment characteristics. Materials and methods: The study included 355 patients with HNC. TUBEM6 was scored prospectively in a standard follow-up program. To design the prediction model, the penalized learning method LASSO was used, with TUBEM6 as the endpoint. Results: The prevalence of TUBEM6 was 10.7%. The multivariable model with the best performance consisted of the variables: advanced T-stage, moderate to severe weight loss at baseline, accelerated radiotherapy, chemoradiation, radiotherapy plus cetuximab, the mean dose to the superior and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle, to the contralateral parotid gland and to the cricopharyngeal muscle. Conclusions: We developed a multivariable NTCP model for TUBEM6 to identify patients at risk for tube feeding dependence. The dosimetric variables can be used to optimize radiotherapy treatment planning aiming at prevention of tube feeding dependence and to estimate the benefit of new radiation technologies. 2014 The Authors.

Head and neck cancer (HNC) can have a profound impact on swallowing function [1â€“5]. The treatment of these patients with radiotherapy (RT), chemoradiation (CRT) or radiotherapy plus cetuximab (CetRT) may further affect swallowing function, eventually leading to tube feeding dependence. Incidences of tube feeding dependence at 2 years after treatment of up to 51% have been reported [6â€“10]. Ronis et al. showed that at 1 year after treatment, the presence of a feeding tube was the most powerful predictor of quality of life in HNC patients [11], thus indicating the clinical importance of preventing tube feeding dependence. One strategy for preventing swallowing dysfunction is to reduce the dose to anatomical structures that are important for swallowing by using advanced radiation delivery techniques such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) [12â€“18]. However, radiotherapy treatment optimization requires information on the most important doseâ€“volume parameters. A multivariable model is used for this purpose. However, no multivariable normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models have yet been published on tube feeding dependence after curative RT or CRT for HNC. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to develop a multivariable NTCP model for tube feeding dependence. 96 Prediction model for tube feeding dependence Materials and methods",2014,

"The role of iron species on the competition of two coastal diatoms, Skeletonema costatum and Thalassosira weissflogii","Abstract. Coastal diatoms are often exposed to macronutrient (N and P) and Fe enrichment. However, how these exposures influence on Fe biogeochemical cycle and then on diatom interspecific competition is unknown. In this study, two non-toxic coastal diatoms, Skeletonema costatum and Thalassosira weissflogii were exposed to N, P, and Fe enrichment for four-day. The growth of algae was co-controlled by macronutrient and Fe species (Fe (III)-EDTA, Fe(OH)3, dissolved, colloidal, and particulate Fe from culture medium). The influence of Fe species on algal cell density was more significant than macronutrient. When S. costatum coexisted with T. weissflogii, their cell density ratios were ranged between 5.57â€“7.03 times, indicating that S. costatum was more competitive than T. weissflogii. There were not significant correlation between cell density ratio and iron requirement, including iron adsorption and absorption per cell, iron adsorption and absorption by all algal cells. As Fe complexing ligands, algal exudates can promote diatom growth itself and such promotion on S. costatum was more obvious than that on T. weissflogii. Iron species was a key determinant on interspecific competition of coastal diatom, and the degree of bioavailability was described as follows: dissolved iron from own exudates > colloidal iron from own exudates > particulate iron from own exudates > particulate iron from another algal exudates > colloidal iron from another algal exudates > dissolved iron from another algal exudates > Fe (III)-EDTA> Fe (OH)3.",2013,Biogeosciences Discussions
Taming the Factor Zooâˆ—,"The asset pricing literature has produced hundreds of potential risk factors. Organizing this â€œzoo of factorsâ€ and distinguishing between useful, useless, and redundant factors require econometric techniques that can deal with the curse of dimensionality. We propose a model-selection method to systematically evaluate the contribution to asset pricing of any new factor, above and beyond what a high-dimensional set of existing factors explains. Our methodology explicitly accounts for potential model-selection mistakes, unlike the standard approaches that assume perfect variable selection, which rarely occurs in finite sample and produces a bias due to the omitted variables. We apply our procedure to a set of factors recently discovered in the literature. We show that several factors â€“ such as profitability and investments â€“ have statistically significant explanatory power beyond the hundreds of factors proposed in the past. In addition, we show that our risk price estimates and their significance are stable, whereas the model selected by simple LASSO is not.",2017,
Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks from Genetic Perturbations with Linear Regression Model,"It is an effective strategy to use both genetic perturbation data and gene expression data to infer regulatory networks that aims to improve the detection accuracy of the regulatory relationships among genes. Based on both types of data, the genetic regulatory networks can be accurately modeled by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). In this paper, a linear regression (LR) model is formulated based on the SEM, and a novel iterative scheme using Bayesian inference is proposed to estimate the parameters of the LR model (LRBI). Comparative evaluations of LRBI with other two algorithms, the Adaptive Lasso (AL-Based) and the Sparsity-aware Maximum Likelihood (SML), are also presented. Simulations show that LRBI has significantly better performance than AL-Based, and overperforms SML in terms of power of detection. Applying the LRBI algorithm to experimental data, we inferred the interactions in a network of 35 yeast genes. An open-source program of the LRBI algorithm is freely available upon request.",2013,PLoS ONE
"An Integrated Campaign Against Riverine Tsetse, Glossina palpalis gambiensis and Glossina tachinoides, by Trapping, and the Release of Sterile Males","The combination of a trapping system of insecticide impregnated screens and biconical traps followed by the release of sterile males led to the complete control of Glossina palpalis gambiensis and Glossina tachinoides in the agro-pastoral zone of Sideradougou. This area, situated south of Bobo Dioulasso, Upper Volta, in the Guinea savannah, covers an area of approx. 3000 km2. Along more than 650 km of rivers, bordered by gallery forests and infested by riverine tsetse, 6500 impregnated screens were placed during 4 months of the dry season, followed by the release of sterile males in the rainy season. For release purposes, colonies of 150,000 producing females of G.p. gambiensis and 85,000 females of G. tachinoides were maintained in industrial colonies on artificial membranes. Reinvasion of the project area was prevented by two barriers consisting of biconical traps impregnated with synthetic pyrethroid in one and simple biconical capture traps in the other. The screens reduced the initial fly population by 94% and permitted the release of only 35 sterile males per km of river to attain the planned ratio of seven sterile males to one wild male. Regular surveys showed that, after 4 months of release of sterile males, the relic fly population was constantly decreasing and tending towards disappearance. p ]An economic evaluation based on the production costs of the sterile males together with the costs of field operations showed that this combination of two non-pollutant methods was competitive with other methods of tsetse control.RÃ©sumÃ©Lâ€™emploi simultanÃ© dâ€™Ã©crans attractifs imprÃ©gnÃ©s dâ€™insecticide et de piÃ¨ges biconiques, suivi de lÃ¢chers de mÃ¢les stÃ©riles, a permis le contrÃ´le de G.p. gambiensis et de G. tachinoides dans la zone agro-pastorale de SidÃ©radougou. p ]Cette zone, situÃ©e dans la savane GuinÃ©enne, au sud de Bobo-Dioulasso (Haute-Volta), couvre une surface approx. de 3000 km2. p ]Plus de 650 km de riviÃ¨res, bordÃ©es de forÃªts galeries infestÃ©es par les glossines riveraines, ont Ã©tÃ© traitÃ©s par les mÃ©thodes suivantes: 6500 Ã©crans imprÃ©gnÃ©s, placÃ©s pendant 4 mois de saison sÃ¨che, auxquels ont fait suite les lÃ¢chers de mÃ¢les stÃ©riles pendant la saison des pluies.

"Seasonal nekton assemblages in a flooded coastal freshwater marsh, Southwest Louisiana, USA","Marsh flooding and drying may be key factors affecting seasonal nekton distribution and density because habitat connectivity and water depth can impact nekton accessibility to the marsh surface. Recent studies have characterized freshwater nekton assemblages in marsh ponds; however, a paucity of information exists on the nekton assemblages in freshwater emergent marshes. The principal objectives of this study are to characterize the seasonal nekton assemblage in a freshwater emergent marsh and compare nekton species composition, density, and biomass to that of freshwater marsh ponds. We hypothesize that 1) freshwater emergent marsh has lower taxa richness than freshwater marsh ponds; and 2) freshwater emergent marsh has a lower seasonal density and biomass than freshwater marsh ponds. Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis and least killifish Heterandria formosa were abundant species in both habitats while some abundant species (e.g., banded pygmy sunfish Elassoma zonatum) in freshwater ponds were absent in freshwater emergent marsh. Our data did not support our first and second hypotheses because taxa richness, seasonal density and biomass between freshwater emergent marsh and ponds did not statistically differ. However, freshwater emergent marsh was dry during the summer months and thus supports no fish species during this period. Additional long-term research on the effects of flow regime in the freshwater marsh on nekton assemblages would potentially improve our understanding of nekton habitat requirements.",2013,Open Journal of Ecology
Feature selection and validated predictive performance in the domain of Legionella pneumophila: a comparative study,"BackgroundGenetic comparisons of clinical and environmental Legionella strains form an essential part of outbreak investigations. DNA microarrays often comprise many DNA markers (features). Feature selection and the development of prediction models are particularly challenging in this domain with many variables and comparatively few subjects or data points. We aimed to compare modeling strategies to develop prediction models for classifying infections as clinical or environmental.MethodsWe applied a bootstrap strategy for preselecting important features to a database containing 222 Legionella pneumophila strains with 448 continuous markers and a dichotomous outcome (clinical or environmental). Feature selection was done with 50 bootstrap samples resulting in a top 10 of most important features for each of four modeling techniques: classification and regression trees (CART), random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Validation was done in a second bootstrap re-sampling loop (200Ã—) for evaluation of discriminatory model performance according to the AUC.ResultsThe top 5 of selected features differed considerably between the various modeling techniques, with only one common feature (â€œLePn.007B8â€). The mean validated AUC-values of the SVM model and the CART model were 0.859 and 0.873 respectively. The LASSO and the RF model showed higher validated AUC-values (0.925 and 0.975 respectively).ConclusionsIn the domain of Legionella pneumophila, which comprises many potential features for classifying of infections as clinical or environmental, the RF and LASSO techniques provide good prediction models. The identification of potentially biologically relevant features is highly dependent on the technique used, and should hence be interpreted with caution.",2016,BMC Research Notes
Traceability of Blood Transfusions and Reporting of Adverse Reactions in Developing Countries: A Six-Year Postpilot Phase Experience in Burkina Faso,"Traceability is an essential tool for haemovigilance and transfusion safety. In Burkina Faso, the implementation of haemovigilance has been achieved as part of a pilot project from 2005 to 2009. Our study aims to evaluate the traceability of blood transfusions and reporting of adverse reactions over the 6-year postpilot phase. A cross-sectional study including all blood units ordered between 2010 and 2015 has been conducted in public and private health care facilities supplied with blood products by the transfusion center of Bobo-Dioulasso. The complete traceability was possible for 83.5% of blood units delivered. Adverse reactions were reported in 107 cases representing 2.1/1,000 blood units per annum. Transfusions of wrong blood to wrong patient were reported in 13 cases. Our study shows that the haemovigilance system in Burkina Faso must be improved. Healthcare workers have to be sensitized on how traceability and haemovigilance could impact the quality of care provided to patients.",2018,Advances in Hematology

"Evolution and hydrocarbon habitat of the South Turgay Basin, Kazakhstan","The South Turgay Basin is a Mesozoic intracontinental rift with a Lower Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous fill. It is underlain by a basement complex 
comprising Precambrian metamorphics and Palaeozoic carbonates and clastics, and 
was formed as a result of right lateral movement on the Karatauâ€“Talassoâ€“Fergana 
Fault. Four principal graben systems are found in the basin. These are the Ariskum, Akshabulak, Sarylan and Bozingen grabens. The graben fill is represented by up to 5 km of dominantly continental sediments, with lacustrine, alluvial and fluvial units, with a series of gross fining-upwards sequences in the Lower to Middle Jurassic (syn-rift) and Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous (post-rift). Marginal marine conditions began to become established during the Apto-Albian with a marine transgression from the west. Tertiary regional uplift resulting from the Indiaâ€“Eurasia collision stripped off later deposits. Recoverable hydrocarbons in the order of 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent have been proven to date in the large Kumkol Field and a number of smaller pools.",2000,Petroleum Geoscience
Arthroscopic Double-Layer Lasso Loop Technique to Repair Delaminated Rotator Cuff Tears.,"PURPOSE
To evaluate the arthroscopic double-layer lasso loop repair technique for delaminated posterosuperior rotator cuff tears.


METHODS
Forty-one patients underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated posterosuperior rotator cuff tear by the double-layer lasso loop technique. Their preoperative and postoperative clinical and functional scores were compared to evaluate surgical outcomes. The prerequisite for inclusion was a minimum follow-up period of 2Â years. We excluded patients with a history of shoulder surgery before the double-layer lasso loop repair.


RESULTS
StatisticallyÂ significant improvements (P < .001) were found in the Constant score (54 vs 83) and University of California, Los Angeles functional score (6.4 vs 9.5). Pain and strength improved according to the Jobe test, bear-hug test, belly-press test, Gerber lift-off test, and external rotation test (P < .001). No significant difference in strength was noted between the operated and nonoperated sides. There was only 1 complete rerupture (3.1%), whereas 5 patients (15.6%) had partial ruptures.


CONCLUSIONS
The arthroscopic double-layer lasso loop repair technique for delaminated posterosuperior rotator cuff tears is an effective procedure. Our series showed a low rerupture rate. At a mean follow-up of 44Â months, postoperative recovery with resultant functional, pain, and patient satisfaction scores was good to excellent and was comparable with the nonoperated side.

The Derivation and Validation of a Geriatric-Sensitive Perioperative Cardiac Risk Index (GSCRI),"Author(s): Alrezk, Rami | Advisor(s): Elashoff, David; Hu, Perry | Abstract: Surgical patients age 65 and over face a high risk of cardiac complications. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) and the Gupta Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA) are widely used to predict perioperative cardiac risk but they are not specifically designed to predict that risk in geriatric patients. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a geriatric-sensitive cardiac risk index (GSCRI). Three variables were selected using Lasso regression in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) 2013 with the addition of four clinically significant variables. The model was developed using the NSQIP 2013 geriatric cohort (N=485,426) (172,905 age â‰¥ 65) and validated on the NSQIP 2012 geriatric cohort (N=485,426) (210,914 age â‰¥ 65). The Area under the Curve (AUC) for the NSQIP 2012 geriatric cohort for three indices was compared. Gupta MICA had an AUC of 0.70 and the RCRI had an AUC of 0.63. Our GSCRI model showed better performance with an AUC of 0.76",2016,
The Benefit of Group Sparsity in Group Inference with De-biased Scaled Group Lasso,"We study confidence regions and approximate chi-squared tests for variable groups in high-dimensional linear regression. When the size of the group is small, low-dimensional projection estimators for individual coefficients can be directly used to construct efficient confidence regions and p-values for the group. However, the existing analyses of low-dimensional projection estimators do not directly carry through for chi-squared-based inference of a large group of variables without inflating the sample size by a factor of the group size. We propose to de-bias a scaled group Lasso for chi-squared-based statistical inference for potentially very large groups of variables. We prove that the proposed methods capture the benefit of group sparsity under proper conditions, for statistical inference of the noise level and variable groups, large and small. Such benefit is especially strong when the group size is large.",2014,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Bi-level variable selection via adaptive sparse group Lasso,"Penalization has been extensively adopted for variable selection in regression. In some applications, covariates have natural grouping structures, where those in the same group have correlated measurements or related functions. Under such settings, variable selection should be conducted at both the group-level and within-group-level, that is, a bi-level selection. In this study, we propose the adaptive sparse group Lasso (adSGL) method, which combines the adaptive Lasso and adaptive group Lasso (GL) to achieve bi-level selection. It can be viewed as an improved version of sparse group Lasso (SGL) and uses data-dependent weights to improve selection performance. For computation, a block coordinate descent algorithm is adopted. Simulation shows that adSGL has satisfactory performance in identifying both individual variables and groups and lower false discovery rate and mean square error than SGL and GL. We apply the proposed method to the analysis of a household healthcare expenditure data set.",2015,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation

"The predatorâ€™s new clothes: juvenile Plectropomus maculatus, a mimic of Scolopsis monogramma","Mimicry is a commonstrategyamongcoral reeffishes that use diversemorphological features and behaviors to avoid predators or to increase successful foraging. Juvenile coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) strongly rely on coral habitat for food, shelter, andnurserygrounds (Wen et al. 2012) and have been hypothesized to mimic poisonous pufferfish. Coral trout Plectropomus laevis, P. leopardus, and P. maculatus are mimics of Canthigaster valentini and Canthigaster papua based on their color pattern, divergent diets, and â€˜â€˜scullingâ€™â€™ swimming behavior (Frisch 2006). These juvenile Plectropomus fishes might benefit by resembling the poisonous pufferfishes (Batesian mimicry) and by increased access to prey (aggressivemimicry).Here,we report another mimicry case of juvenile coral trout. Plectropomusmaculatus resembles juvenileScolopsis monogramma. Both inhabit shallow living Acropora coral in Great Keppel Islands, Great Barrier Reefs (Fig. 1a).Weobserved this juvenileP.maculatuswith similar body colorations as S.monogramma (Fig. 1b), including a greenish-gray body color, a distinct black stripe from snout to tail. In addition, this mimicry of coral troutalsodisplaysontogeneticchangesas inFrisch (2006),and theblackstripewasmuchclearerat3 cmTLthenstarted todisappear at 15 cmTL (Fig. 1c, d).We hypothesized that this juvenileP.maculatus individual displays aggressivemimicry of S. monogramma as the latterâ€™s benthic crustaceandiet allows theirmimics to strike preygobids andblenniids. Similar cases of aggressivemimicmodelswere also recorded in Serranids, such as juvenile of Anyperodon leucogrammicus andHalichoeres leucurus, Mycteroperca tigris and Thalassoma bifasciatum (Randall, 2005). To our knowledge, this is the first report of juvenile P. maculatusmimicking S. monogramma; however, the actual mimetic relationship between these two species is still unclear. Further investigations of the behavior, relative abundance, and habitat preference of P. maculatus and S. monogramma are needed to verify these observations.",2018,Coral Reefs
"Phenanthro[1.10]-annelated [3.3.3]propellanes by cyclodehydrogenation reactions of mono-, di-, and tribenzylidenetriptindanes","The synthesis of [3.3.3]propellanes 18, 19, and 3 bearing one, two, or three [1,10]-fused phenanthrene units instead of a simple benzene ring has been performed. Starting from tryptindan-9-one 4, the hitherto unknown tryptindane-9,10-dione 5 and tryptindane-9,10,11-trione 10, the corresponding mono-, di-, and tribenzylidenetriptindanes 7, 9, and 13 have been prepared. In all three cases. the stereoisomers bearing cis-oriented benzylidene groups. i.e., (Z)-stilbene units. are formed predominantly. The monostilbene (Z)-7 and the tristilbene (Z,Z,Z)-13 were obtained in pure form and their stereochemistry was fully characterized. Photocyclodehydrogenation of 7 under Mallory-Katz conditions gave dibenzo(phenanthro-[1,10])[3.3.3]propellane 18 in an almost quantitative yield, irrespective of the stereoisomeric composition of 7. In contrast, photocyclodehydrogenation of distilbene 9 gave the unusual propellane-fused elassovalene 20 in a moderate yield, and the expected benzodi-(phenanthro-[1,10])[3.3.3]propellane 19 was only obtained in a low yield. As an extreme case, tristilbene (Z,Z,Z)-13 eluded the desired threefold photolytic cyclodehydrogenation; however, catalytic cyclodehydrogenation by Pt/Al2O3/Ti at 310 degrees C furnished the threefold acephenanthrylene 3 in a yield of 18%.",1999,European Journal of Organic Chemistry
Collaborative hierarchical sparse modeling,"Sparse modeling is a powerful framework for data analysis and processing. Traditionally, encoding in this framework is done by solving an â„“1-regularized linear regression problem, usually called Lasso. In this work we first combine the sparsity-inducing property of the Lasso model, at the individual feature level, with the block-sparsity property of the group Lasso model, where sparse groups of features are jointly encoded, obtaining a sparsity pattern hierarchically structured. This results in the hierarchical Lasso, which shows important practical modeling advantages. We then extend this approach to the collaborative case, where a set of simultaneously coded signals share the same sparsity pattern at the higher (group) level but not necessarily at the lower one. Signals then share the same active groups, or classes, but not necessarily the same active set. This is very well suited for applications such as source separation. An efficient optimization procedure, which guarantees convergence to the global optimum, is developed for these new models. The underlying presentation of the new framework and optimization approach is complemented with experimental examples and preliminary theoretical results.",2010,2010 44th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)
"Patterns in tropical seagrass photosynthesis in relation to light, depth and habitat","Seagrass meadows across north-eastern Australia, survive a range of environmental conditions in coastal bays, reefs, estuarine and deepwater habitats through adaptation of a range of structural, morphological and physiological features. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of spatial features (habitat type, site and depth) and photon flux on the photosynthetic performance of 11 tropical seagrass species. Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry was used to generate rapid light curves from which measures of maximal electron transport rate (ETRmax), photosynthetic efficiency (?), saturating irradiance (Ek) and effective quantum yield (?F/Fm?) were derived. The amount of light absorbed by leaves (absorption factor) was also determined for each population. In intertidal habitats many seagrass species exhibited typical sun-type responses with a close coupling of both ETRmax and Ek with photon flux. Photosynthetic performance ranged from minima in Thalassodendron ciliatum to maxima in Syringodium isoetifolium. The absence of a coupling between photosynthetic performance and photon flux in subtidal populations was most likely due to highly variable light climates and possible light attenuation, and hence the photo-biology of estuarine and deepwater seagrasses exhibited photosynthetic responses indicative of light limitation. In contrast seagrass species from shallow reef and coastal habitats for the most part exhibited light saturation characteristics. Of all the variables examined ETRmax, Ek and ?F/Fm? were most responsive to changing light climates and provide reliable physiological indicators of real-time photosynthetic performance of tropical seagrasses under different light conditions.",2007,Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science
Development and validation of the immune signature to predict distant metastasis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND
The tumor immune microenvironment has clinicopathological significance in predicting prognosis and therapeutic efficacy. We aimed to develop an immune signature to predict distant metastasis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).


METHODS
Using multiplexed quantitative fluorescence, we detected 17 immune biomarkers in a primary screening cohort of 54 NPC tissues presenting with/without distant metastasis following radical therapy. The LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) logistic regression model used statistically significant survival markers in the training cohort (n=194) to build an immune signature. The prognostic and predictive accuracy of it was validated in an external independent group of 304 patients.


RESULTS
Eight statistically significant markers were identified in the screening cohort. The immune signature consisting of four immune markers (PD-L1+ CD163+, CXCR5, CD117) in intratumor was adopted to classify patients into high and low risk in the training cohort and it showed a high level of reproducibility between different batches of samples (r=0.988 for intratumor; p<0.0001). High-risk patients had shorter distant metastasis-free survival (HR 5.608, 95%â€‰CI 2.619 to 12.006; p<0.0001) and progression-free survival (HR 2.798, 95%â€‰CI 1.498 to 5.266; p=0Â·001). The C-indexes which reflected the predictive capacity in training and validation cohort were 0.703 and 0.636, respectively. Low-risk patients benefited from induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (IC+CCRT) (HR 0.355, 95%â€‰CI 0.147 to 0.857; p=0Â·021), while high-risk patients did not (HR 1.329, 95% CI 0.543 to 3.253; p=0Â·533). To predict the individual risk of distant metastasis, nomograms with the integration of both immune signature and clinicopathological risk factors were developed.


CONCLUSIONS
The immune signature provided a reliable estimate of distant metastasis risk in patients with NPC and might be applied to identify the cohort which benefit from IC+CCRT.",2020,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer
Speaker adaptation based on regularized speaker-dependent eigenphone matrix estimation,"Eigenphone-based speaker adaptation outperforms conventional maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) and eigenvoice methods when there is sufficient adaptation data. However, it suffers from severe over-fitting when only a few seconds of adaptation data are provided. In this paper, various regularization methods are investigated to obtain a more robust speaker-dependent eigenphone matrix estimation. Element-wise l1 norm regularization (known as lasso) encourages the eigenphone matrix to be sparse, which reduces the number of effective free parameters and improves generalization. Squared l2 norm regularization promotes an element-wise shrinkage of the estimated matrix towards zero, thus alleviating over-fitting. Column-wise unsquared l2 norm regularization (known as group lasso) acts like the lasso at the column level, encouraging column sparsity in the eigenphone matrix, i.e., preferring an eigenphone matrix with many zero columns as solution. Each column corresponds to an eigenphone, which is a basis vector of the phone variation subspace. Thus, group lasso tries to prevent the dimensionality of the subspace from growing beyond what is necessary. For nonzero columns, group lasso acts like a squared l2 norm regularization with an adaptive weighting factor at the column level. Two combinations of these methods are also investigated, namely elastic net (applying l1 and squared l2 norms simultaneously) and sparse group lasso (applying l1 and column-wise unsquared l2 norms simultaneously). Furthermore, a simplified method for estimating the eigenphone matrix in case of diagonal covariance matrices is derived, and a unified framework for solving various regularized matrix estimation problems is presented. Experimental results show that these methods improve the adaptation performance substantially, especially when the amount of adaptation data is limited. The best results are obtained when using the sparse group lasso method, which combines the advantages of both the lasso and group lasso methods. Using speaker-adaptive training, performance can be further improved.",2014,"EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing"
Orlando di Lasso and the commedia dell'arte,"In addition to his prodigious musical achievements, Orlando di Lasso has earned a significant place in theatre history through his involvement with the commedia dell'arte, as director, composer and writer, but also as a comic actor who mastered several demanding stage roles. This article examines Lasso's contribution to the early history of the commedia dell'arte and suggests ways in which a Flemish musician based in Bavaria might have acquired, as early as the 1560s, acting skills which evidently did not compare unfavourably with those of contemporary Italian professionals.

Complex multitask Bayesian compressive sensing,"An effective complex multitask Bayesian compressive sensing (CMT-BCS) algorithm is proposed to recover sparse or group sparse complex signals. The existing multitask Bayesian compressive sensing (MT-CS) algorithm is powerful in recovering multiple real-valued sparse solutions. However, a large class of sensing problems deal with complex values. A simple approach, which decomposes a complex value into independent real and imaginary components, does not take into account the group sparsity of these two components and thus yields poor recovery performance. In this paper, we first introduce the CMT-BCS algorithm that jointly treats the real and imaginary components, and then derive a fast and accurate algorithm for the estimation of the prior parameters by solving a surrogate convex function. The proposed CMT-BCS algorithm achieves effective complex sparse signal recovery and outperforms MT-CS and complex group Lasso.",2014,"2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Functional connectivity analysis for thalassemia disease based on a graphical lasso model,"Thalassemia is a congenital disorder of hemoglobin synthesis which can lead to thromboembolic events and stroke in the brain. In this work we propose to use a functional connectivity model to discriminate between control and diseased subjects. Our connectivity measure is based on functional magnetic resonance imaging, and hence common variations of the blood oxygenation level in spatially distant areas. Analyzing this connectivity could highlight abnormal neuronal activation and provide us with a descriptor (bio-marker) of the disease. To estimate the connectivity, we propose a robust learning scheme based on the graphical lasso model, whose hyperparameter is validated within a cross-validation scheme. To analyze model fit, we transfer the mean connectivity from the control group to the thalassemic patient group. Our null hypothesis is that the model learned on control subjects is perfectly adequate (in the maximum likelihood sense) to describe the patients. The results of the permutation test suggest that the some patients with thalassemia do not have the same connectivity structure as the control.",2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)
Learning to Forget: A Rite of Adolescence?,"As a young boy growing up in an Italian immigrant neighborhood in New York City during the early 1900s, Leonard Covello recalled bringing home an elementary school report card for his father to sign. But a conflict between family and school quickly surfaced in their tenement household when the father spotted a different spelling of his last name. ""What is this 'Leonard Covello'?"" the father exclaimed. ""What happened to the i in Coviello?"" A silence fell over the family. ""From Leonardo to Leonard I can follow,"" the father continued. ""A perfectly natural process. In America anything can happen and does happen. But you don't change a family name. A name is a name. What happened to the i?"" Leonard defended his teacher's actions. ""Mrs. Cutter took it out,"" he explained. ""Every time she pronounced Coviello it came out Covello. So she took out the i. That way it's easier for everybody."" ""And what has this Mrs. Cutter got to do with my name?"" the father demanded. ""What difference does it make?"" Leonard shot back, one of the first times that he ever dared to oppose his father. ""It's more American. The i doesn't help anything."" Leonard watched as his father bitterly fumed over the school's intrusion into their family life, then shrugged his shoulders in resignation, signed the report card, and slid it back across the table to his son. This initial conflict between family and school grew larger over the years, particularly when Leonard and his adolescent peers moved on to a newer, more encompassing institution: the American high school. ""We soon got the idea that 'Italian' meant something inferior, and a barrier was erected between children of Italian origin and their parents,"" he wrote.

Single and joint effects of regional- and local-scale variables on tropical seagrass fish assemblages,"Seagrass beds are highly important for tropical ecosystems by supporting abundant and diverse fish assemblages that form the basis for artisanal fisheries. Although a number of local- and regional-scale variables are known to influence the abundance, diversity and assemblageÂ structure of seagrass-associated fish assemblages, few studies have evaluated the relative and joint (interacting) influences of variables, especially those acting at different scales. Here, we examined the relative importance of local- and regional-scale factors structuring seagrass-associated fish assemblages, using a field survey in six seagrass (Thalassodendron ciliatum) areas around Unguja Island (Zanzibar, Tanzania). Fish density and assemblage structure were mostly affected by two regional-scale variables; distance to coral reefs, which positively affected fish density, and level of human development, which negatively affected fish density. On the local scale, seagrass biomass had a positive (but weaker) influence on fish density. However, the positive effect of seagrass biomass decreased with increasing level of human development. In summary, our results highlight the importance of assessing how multiple local and regional variables, alone and together, influence fish communities, in order to improve management of seagrass ecosystemsÂ and their services.",2014,Marine Biology
AXIOpedia : Enriching DBpedia with OWL Axioms from Wikipedia,"The Semantic Web relies on the creation of rich knowledge bases which link data on the Web. Having access to such a knowledge base enables significant progress in difficult and challenging tasks such as semantic annotation and retrieval. DBpedia, the RDF representation of Wikipedia, is considered today as the central interlinking hub for the emerging Web of data. However, DBpedia still displays some substantial limitations such as the lack of class definitions and the lack of significant taxonomical links. The objective of this work is to enrich DBpedia with OWL-defined classes and taxonomical links using open information extraction from Wikipedia. We propose a pattern-based approach that relies on SPARQL to automatically extract axioms from Wikipedia definitions. We run the system on 12,901,822 Wikipedia pages (including disambiguation pages).

Modern pollen studies in the territory of Sagalassos (Southwest Turkey) and their use in the interpretation of a Late Holocene pollen diagram.,"Modern pollen precipitation studies were carried out on a regional scale in the territory of the classical city of Sagalassos (Southwest Turkey). 57 moss cushions and 7 soil samples from different vegetation types were analysed palynologically. The resulting pollen spectra were grouped into 14 vegetation groups, which were examined using discriminant analysis and principal components analysis. These numerical procedures are applied to display the structure in the data set in a comprehensive way. Some of the modern spectra groups seem to be well-defined, whereas others are difficult to distinguish from each other. After the relationships between the modern pollen spectra had been analysed, the fossil data from a core from the marsh of Gravgaz were added to the data set so that any similarities between fossil and modern spectra could be seen. A joint principal components analysis of the modern and fossil pollen spectra revealed that the pollen spectra from the earliest (ca. 2600-2500 BP; Cal. 830-590 BC till 790-520 BC) and the latest (starting at ca. 1300 BP; Cal. 660-780 AD) pollen assemblage zones have modern counterparts. On the other hand, the pollen spectra from the pollen assemblage zone dominated by Artemisia (ca. 2500-2300 BP; Cal. 790-520 BC till 410-210 BC) and from the pollen assemblage zone that indicated the practice of arboriculture (ca. 2300-1300 BP; Cal. 410-210 BC till 660-780 AD) have no close modern analogues, although individual tabulated pollen percentages revealed some similarities with some modern spectra groups.",2001,Review of palaeobotany and palynology
Rufomycin Targets ClpC1 Proteolysis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. abscessus,"ClpC1 is an emerging new target for the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections, and several cyclic peptides (ecumicin, cyclomarin A, and lassomycin) are known to act on this target. This study identified another group of peptides, the rufomycins (RUFs), as bactericidal to M. tuberculosis through the inhibition of ClpC1 and subsequent modulation of protein degradation of intracellular proteins. Rufomycin I (RUFI) was found to be a potent and selective lead compound for both M. tuberculosis (MIC, 0.02â€‰Î¼M) and Mycobacterium abscessus (MIC, 0.4â€‰Î¼M). Spontaneously generated mutants resistant to RUFI involved seven unique single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations at three distinct codons within the N-terminal domain of clpC1 (V13, H77, and F80). RUFI also significantly decreased the proteolytic capabilities of the ClpC1/P1/P2 complex to degrade casein, while having no significant effect on the ATPase activity of ClpC1. This represents a marked difference from ecumicin, which inhibits ClpC1 proteolysis but stimulates the ATPase activity, thereby providing evidence that although these peptides share ClpC1 as a macromolecular target, their downstream effects are distinct, likely due to differences in binding.",2019,Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy
"Updated worldwide survey on the methods, efficacy, and safety of catheter ablation for human atrial fibrillation.","BACKGROUND
The purpose of this study was to provide an updated worldwide report on the methods, efficacy, and safety of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF).


METHODS AND RESULTS
A questionnaire with 46 questions was sent to 521 centers from 24 countries in 4 continents. Complete interviews were collected from 182 centers, of which 85 reported to have performed 20,825 catheter ablation procedures on 16,309 patients with AF between 2003 and 2006. The median number of procedures per center was 245 (range, 2 to 2715). All centers included paroxysmal AF, 85.9% also included persistent and 47.1% also included long-lasting AF. Carto-guided left atrial circumferential ablation (48.2% of patients) and Lasso-guided ostial electric disconnection (27.4%) were the most commonly used techniques. Efficacy data were analyzed with centers representing the unit of analysis. Of 16,309 patients with full disclosure of outcome data, 10 488 (median, 70.0%; interquartile range, 57.7% to 75.4%) became asymptomatic without antiarrhythmic drugs and another 2047 (10.0%; 0.5% to 17.1%) became asymptomatic in the presence of previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs over 18 (range, 3 to 24) months of follow-up. Success rates free of antiarrhythmic drugs and overall success rates were significantly larger in 9590 patients with paroxysmal AF (74.9% and 83.2%) than in 2800 patients with persistent AF (64.8% and 75.0%) and 1108 patients with long-lasting AF (63.1% and 72.3%) (P<0.0001). Major complications were reported in 741 patients (4.5%).


CONCLUSIONS
When analyzed in a large number of electrophysiology laboratories worldwide, catheter ablation of AF shows to be effective in approximately 80% of patients after 1.3 procedures per patient, with approximately 70% of them not requiring further antiarrhythmic drugs during intermediate follow-up.",2010,Circulation.
