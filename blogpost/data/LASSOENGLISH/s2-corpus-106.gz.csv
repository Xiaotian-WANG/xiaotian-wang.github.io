Modeling Item-item Similarities for Personalized Recommendations on Yahoo! Front Page,"We consider the problem of algorithmically recommending items to users on a Yahoo! front page module. Our approach is based on a novel multilevel hierarchical model that we refer to as a User Profile Model with Graphical Lasso (UPG). The UPG provides a personalized recommendation to users by simultaneously incorporating both user covariates and historical user interactions with items in a model based way. In fact, we build a per-item regression model based on a rich set of user covariates and estimate individual user affinity to items by introducing a latent random vector for each user. The vector random effects are assumed to be drawn from a prior with a precision matrix that measures residual partial associations among items. To ensure better estimates of a precision matrix in high-dimensions, the matrix elements are constrained through a Lasso penalty. Our model is fitted through a penalized-quasi likelihood procedure coupled with a scalable EM algorithm. We employ several computational strategies like multi-threading, conjugate gradients and heavily exploit problem structure to scale our computations in the E-step. For the M-step we take recourse to a scalable variant of the Graphical Lasso algorithm for covariance selection. Through extensive experiments on a new data set obtained from Yahoo! front page and a benchmark data set from a movie recommender application, we show that our UPG model significantly improves performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods in the literature, especially those based on a bilinear random effects model (BIRE). In particular, we show that the gains of UPG are significant compared to BIRE when the number of users is large and the number of items to select from is small. For large item sets and relatively small user sets the results of UPG and BIRE are comparable. The UPG leads to faster model building and produces outputs which are interpretable.",2011,The Annals of Applied Statistics
Deaeration apparatus and method for venting a housing and supporting fan,"There is a venting device, and a method for venting a housing, in particular a printing machine housing will be described. The venting device comprises a first fan, a second fan, a flow chamber with an inlet opening and an exit opening, and a riser tube, which are arranged in ventilation direction in the order of the first blower inlet port, the flow chamber exit port, second fan and riser. At least one constantly at least partly open equalizing opening which has a greater flow resistance than the inlet opening of the flow chamber, connects the flow chamber between Einblassoffnung and exit opening with the surroundings. In the venting process in normal operation housing air is passed by means of a first blower out of the housing through an inlet opening in a flow chamber, and the housing air is passed through an outlet opening from the flow chamber by means of a second blower through a riser pipe into the environment. The second fan draws over at least a constantly at least partly open-equalizing opening which connects the flow chamber between inlet opening and outlet opening with the environment, ambient air and passes it on together with the housing air through the riser pipe. The at least one compensation opening has a larger flow resistance than the inlet opening of the flow chamber. Further, a fan support is described with a suction port, a flow chamber, a blower and an exhaust port which are arranged in the order named. The blower is disposed such that it can generate an air flow from the intake port through the flow chamber to the outlet port, and there is at least a constantly at least partly open-equalizing opening is provided which connects the flow chamber between the intake opening and the blower with the environment. The at least one compensation opening has a larger flow resistance than the suction opening.",2009,
Cell membrane GM 1 ganglioside is a functional coreceptor for fibroblast growth factor 2,"Free gangliosides bind fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), thus preventing cell interaction and biological activity of the growth factor in endothelial cells. Here we investigated the role of cellassociated gangliosides in mediating the biological activity of FGF2. Treatment of endothelial cells of different origin with the ganglioside biosynthesis inhibitors fumonisin B1, D-threo-1-phenyl2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol or D-1-threo-1-phenyl2-hexa-decanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol-HCl, impairs their capacity to proliferate when exposed to FGF2. Also, the mitogenic activity of FGF2 is inhibited by the GM1-binding cholera toxin B subunit (CTB). Conversely, overloading of endothelial GM 7373 cell membranes with exogenous GM1 causes a 10-fold increase of the mitogenic potency of FGF2. 125I-FGF2 binds to cell membrane GM1 (Kd 5 3 nM) in complex ganglioside/heparan sulfate-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1-pgsA745 cell mutants that were overloaded with exogenous GM1. Moreover, FGF2 competes with FITC-CTB for the binding to cell membrane GM1 in different CHO cell lines independently of their capacity to express heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Conversely, CTB inhibits cell proliferation triggered by FGF2 in CHO cells overexpressing the tyrosine kinase FGF receptor 1. Finally, GM1-overloading confers to FGF receptor 1-transfected, complex ganglioside-deficient CHO-K1 cell mutants the capacity to proliferate when stimulated by FGF2. This proliferation is inhibited by CTB. Cell proliferation triggered by serum or by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is instead independent of the cell membrane ganglioside milieu. In conclusion, cell membrane GM1 binds FGF2 and is required for the mitogenic activity of the growth factor. Our data indicate that cell-associated gangliosides may act as functional FGF2 co-receptors in different cell types.",2002,
Comparative Evaluation of Effectiveness of Different Motor Muscles in Modified Lasso Procedure for Correction of Finger Clawing,"A retrospective study was carried out to compare the effectiveness of different muscles as motors in modified lasso procedures for correction of finger clawing in leprosy. It was observed that palmaris longus and extensor carpi radialis longus were more suitable than the flexor digitorum superficialis. In some patients, removal of superficialis is associated with complications which could not be predicted before surgery. Extensor carpi radialis longus has advantages over palmaris longus in selected cases.",2003,Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume)
Income Distribution and Economic Development: Insights from Machine Learning,"In the literature on inequality and economic development, the overwhelming focus is on the Gini coefficient, a single statistic for the entire income distribution. In this paper, we question this singular focus on the Gini coefficient and evaluate the relative importance of a host of income distribution measures. We draw upon recent advances in causal inferences with high dimensional sparse models that apply insights from machine learning for more robust causal inferences. In a predictive framework, we show that LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) chooses only the headcount measure of poverty as the key income distribution statistic in predicting schooling, institutional quality, and per capital income. Next we show that causal inferences with post-LASSO models, that help guard against omitted variable bias and model selection mistakes, also indicate the fraction of population living in poverty matters much more strongly for development outcomes than does the Gini coefficient. Finally, instrumental variable estimates in conjunction with post-LASSO models show that compared to the Gini coefficient, poverty is more strongly associated with schooling and per capita income, but not for institutional quality. At the very least, our results imply that the causal link from inequality (as measured by Gini) to development outcomes is tenuous.",2016,
Patient Specific Surgical Simulation System for Procedures in Colonoscopy,"We have assembled a preliminary environment for simulating tasks that are performed in colonoscopy to provide a professional learning experience. Different commercial endoscopy simulators exist and provide realistic interfaces, but none of these products are able to simulate realistic soft tissue deformations using patient specific preoperative CT or MRI colon datasets. Colon models are represented as deformable objects within physically-based modeling simulation system. The simplified mass-spring system models an object as a collection of point masses connected by linear springs in a mesh structure. We can import patient specific high resolution meshes from MRI and CT abdominal examinations into a system that models objects with different physical properties for interaction with both non-force-feedback and haptic devices. The score tip of the colonoscope with instrument channel, irrigation, lens and light is modeled and the working channel allows interactions with different instruments as an endoscopic biopsy forceps and a snare (lasso tool) for polyp extraction. This virtual reality system for simulating virtual colonoscopy and polyp extraction can be used to simulate diverse procedures on a variety of pathologies in a novel physical environment and hopefully can shorten training periods and reduce complications.",2001,
A large cohort study identifying a novel prognosis prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma through machine learning strategies,"BackgroundPredicting lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) risk is crucial in determining further treatment strategies. Molecular biomarkers may improve risk stratification for LUAD.MethodsWe analyzed the gene expression profiles of LUAD patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We initially used three distinct algorithms (sigFeature, random forest, and univariate Cox regression) to evaluate each geneâ€™s prognostic relevance. Survival related genes were then fitted into the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model to build a risk prediction model for LUAD. After 100,000 times of calculation and model construction, a 16-gene-based prediction model capable of classifying LUAD patients into high-risk and low-risk groups was successfully built.ResultsUsing a combined strategy, we initially identified 2472 significant survival-related genes. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated these genesâ€™ relevance to tumor initiation and progression. Using the LASSO method, we successfully built a reliable risk prediction model. The risk model was validated in two external sets and an independent set. The expression of these 16 genes was highly correlated with patientsâ€™ risk. High-risk group patients witnessed poorer recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to low-risk group patients. Moreover, stratification analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) confirmed the independence and potential translational value of this predictive tool. We also built a nomogram comprising risk model and stage to predict OS for LUAD patients.ConclusionsOur risk model may serve as a practical and reliable prognosis predictive tool for LUAD and could provide novel insights into the understanding of the molecular mechanism of this disease.",2019,BMC Cancer
Natural Sunlight Shapes Crude Oil-Degrading Bacterial Communities in Northern Gulf of Mexico Surface Waters,"Following the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) spill in 2010, an enormous amount of oil was observed in the deep and surface waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Surface waters are characterized by intense sunlight and high temperature during summer. While the oil-degrading bacterial communities in the deep-sea plume have been widely investigated, the effect of natural sunlight on those in oil polluted surface waters remains unexplored to date. In this study, we incubated surface water from the DWH site with amendments of crude oil, Corexit dispersant, or both for 36 days under natural sunlight in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The bacterial community was analyzed over time for total abundance, density of alkane and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degraders, and community composition via pyrosequencing. Our results showed that, for treatments with oil and/or Corexit, sunlight significantly reduced bacterial diversity and evenness and was a key driver of shifts in bacterial community structure. In samples containing oil or dispersant, sunlight greatly reduced abundance of the Cyanobacterium Synechococcus but increased the relative abundances of Alteromonas, Marinobacter, Labrenzia, Sandarakinotalea, Bartonella, and Halomonas. Dark samples with oil were represented by members of Thalassobius, Winogradskyella, Alcanivorax, Formosa, Pseudomonas, Eubacterium, Erythrobacter, Natronocella, and Coxiella. Both oil and Corexit inhibited the Candidatus Pelagibacter with or without sunlight exposure. For the first time, we demonstrated the effects of light in structuring microbial communities in water with oil and/or Corexit. Overall, our findings improve understanding of oil pollution in surface water, and provide unequivocal evidence that sunlight is a key factor in determining bacterial community composition and dynamics in oil polluted marine waters.",2015,Frontiers in Microbiology
Largeâ€scale oceanographic fluctuations drive Antarctic petrel survival and reproduction,"Polar Regions are experiencing environmental changes at unprecedented rates. These changes can spread throughout entire food webs from lower trophic levels to apex predators. As many top predators forage over large areas, these indirect effects may be associated with large-scale patterns of climate variability. Using global climate indices that are known to impact the Southern Ocean ecosystem (the El Nino Southern Oscillation and Antarctic Oscillation Indices) we assessed their efficacy to predict variation in the demographic parameters of Antarctic seabirds. First, we used a long-term dataset on adult survival (estimated from captureâ€“markâ€“recapture data) and reproduction of Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, from the largest known breeding colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land) and examined whether large-scale oceanographic fluctuations impact survival and reproduction. Second, we conducted an exhaustive literature review to determine whether the effects of large-scale environmental variability on Antarctic seabirds have a coherent fingerprint across the Antarctic continent and nearby islands. We found that most of the variation in both reproductive success, timing of hatching, and survival of Antarctic petrels can be accurately modeled using the two modes of large-scale climate variability in Antarctica. The literature review, combined with the results from our field study, suggests that while the anticipated trends in the global patterns of climatic variability will generally have detrimental effects on populations of top predators in the Southwest Atlantic, these conclusions cannot be extrapolated to all seabird populations in Antarctica without additional data.",2016,Ecography
Super-resolution imaging with radio interferometry using sparse modeling,"We propose a new technique to obtain super-resolution images with radio interferometer using sparse modeling. In standard radio interferometry, sampling of ($u$, $v$) is quite often incomplete and thus obtaining an image from observed visibilities becomes an underdetermined problem, and a technique so-called ""zero-padding"" is often used to fill up unsampled grids in ($u$, $v$) plane, resulting in image degradation by finite beam size as well as numerous side-lobes. In this paper we show that directly solving such an underdetermined problem based on sparse modeling (in this paper LASSO) avoids the above problems introduced by zero-padding, leading to super-resolution images in which structure finer than the standard beam size (diffraction limit) can be reproduced. We present results of one-dimensional and two-dimensional simulations of interferometric imaging, and discuss its implications to super-resolution imaging, particularly focusing on imaging of black hole shadows with millimeter VLBI.",2014,Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan
Quantification of miRNA-mRNA Interactions,"miRNAs are small RNA molecules (' 22nt) that interact with their corresponding target mRNAs inhibiting the translation of the mRNA into proteins and cleaving the target mRNA. This second effect diminishes the overall expression of the target mRNA. Several miRNA-mRNA relationship databases have been deployed, most of them based on sequence complementarities. However, the number of false positives in these databases is large and they do not overlap completely. Recently, it has been proposed to combine expression measurement from both miRNA and mRNA and sequence based predictions to achieve more accurate relationships. In our work, we use LASSO regression with non-positive constraints to integrate both sources of information. LASSO enforces the sparseness of the solution and the non-positive constraints restrict the search of miRNA targets to those with down-regulation effects on the mRNA expression. We named this method TaLasso (miRNA-Target LASSO).We used TaLasso on two public datasets that have paired expression levels of human miRNAs and mRNAs. The top ranked interactions recovered by TaLasso are especially enriched (more than using any other algorithm) in experimentally validated targets. The functions of the genes with mRNA transcripts in the top-ranked interactions are meaningful. This is not the case using other algorithms.TaLasso is available as Matlab or R code. There is also a web-based tool for human miRNAs at http://talasso.cnb.csic.es/.",2012,PLoS ONE
Weighted L 1 -Norm Support Vector Machine for the Classification of Highly Imbalanced Data,"Abstract The support vector machine has been successfully applied to various classiï¬cation areas due to its ï¬‚exibilityand a high level of classiï¬cation accuracy. However, when analyzing imbalanced data with uneven classsizes, the classiï¬cation accuracy of SVM may drop signiï¬cantly in predicting minority class because theSVM classiï¬ers are undesirably biased toward the majority class. The weighted L 2 -norm SVM was devel-oped for the analysis of imbalanced data; however, it cannot identify irrelevant input variables due to thecharacteristics of the ridge penalty. Therefore, we propose the weighted L 1 -norm SVM, which uses lassopenalty to select important input variables and weights to diï¬€erentiate the misclassiï¬cation of data pointsbetween classes. We demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed method through simulationstudies and a real data analysis.Keywords: Imbalanced data, lasso, linear programming, ridge, support vector machine. 1. ì„œë¡  ë²”ì£¼í˜• ìžë£Œì— ëŒ€í•œ ë¶„ë¥˜ë¶„ì„(classi cation analysis)ì€ì‹¤ìƒí™œì˜ë§Žì€ë¶„ì•¼ì—ì„œìœ ìš©í•˜ê²Œ í™œìš©ë˜ê³  ìžˆë‹¤. ì˜ˆë¥¼ ë“¤ì–´, ë¶„ë¥˜ë¶„ì„ì€ì˜ë£Œë¶„ì•¼ì—ì„œí™˜ìžê°€ íŠ¹ì • ì•”ì— ê±¸ë¦´ ê°€ëŠ¥ì„±ì„ì§„ë‹¨í•˜ê±°ë‚˜ íš¨ê³¼ì ì¸ì¹˜ë£Œë²•ì„íŒë‹¨í•˜ëŠ”ë° í™œìš©ë˜ê³ , ê¸ˆìœµë¶„ì•¼ì—ì„œì€í–‰ì˜ì—¬ì‹ ë‹´ë‹¹ìžê°€ ëŒ€ì¶œìžì˜ëŒ€ì¶œ ì—¬ë¶€ ê²°ì •í•˜ëŠ”ë° ì´ìš©ë˜ë©°, í†µì‹ ë¶„ì•¼ì—ì„œëŠ” ì´ë™í†µì‹  ê³ ê°ì˜ìœ ì§€ ë˜ëŠ” ì´íƒˆ ì—¬ë¶€ë¥¼ íŒë³„í•˜ëŠ”ë° í™œìš©ë˜ëŠ” ë“±ì˜ì‚¬ê²°ì •ì„í•„ìš”ë¡œí•˜ëŠ” ë§Žì€ë¶„ì•¼ì—ì„œê·¸ í™œìš©ì„±ì´ì§€ì†ì ìœ¼ë¡œ ì¦ê°€í•˜ê³  ìžˆë‹¤.

Learning of Sparse Fuzzy Cognitive Maps Using Evolutionary Algorithm with Lasso Initialization,"Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs), characterized by a great deal of abstraction, flexibility, adaptability, and fuzzy reasoning, are widely used tools for modeling dynamic systems and decision support systems. Research on the problem of finding sparse FCMs from observed data is outstanding. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) play a key role in learning FCMs from time series without expert knowledge. In this paper, we first involve sparsity penalty in the objective function optimized by EAs. To improve the performance of EAs, we develop an effective initialization operator based on the Lasso, a convex optimization approach. Comparative experiments on synthetic data with varying sizes and densities compared with other state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, the proposed initialization operator is able to promote to performance of EAs in learning sparse FCMs from time series.",2017,
Polychaetes and amphipods as commensals with pagurids from the Alaska shelf,"Abstract Polychaetous annelids and/or amphipod crustaceans were associated with a total of 1715 (20.0 %) out of 8594 pagurids examined from the continental shelf of Alaska. Ten species of polychaetes (Eunoe depressa, E. nodosa, E. senta, Arctonoe vittata, Gattyana ciliata, Cheilonereis cyclurus, Eusyllis blomstrandi, Polydora commensalis, Lanassa venusta, and Crucigera zygophora) and at least three species of amphipods (Melita spp., Parapleustes pugettensis, and Podoceropsis nitida) were recorded with the following pagurids: Pagurus aleuticus, P. capillatus, P. confragosus, P. ochotensis, P. rathbuni, P. setosus, P. trigonocheirus, Elassochirus cavimanus, and Labidochirus splendescens. Eunoe depressa, Cheilonereis cyclurus, Polydora commensalis and Podoceropsis nitida have been previously reported with pagurids.

Antimalarial drug combinations in vastly different settings,Today The Lancet features two randomised trials of different anti malarial drug combinations. Issaka Zongo and colleagues compared artemether-lumefantrine with amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in patients presenting with Plasmodium falciparum malaria to an outpatient department in Bobo-Dioulasso Burkina Faso. The catchment area here has high-intensity transmission (ento mological inoculation rate over 100). Alison Ratcliff and colleagues compared artemether-lumefantrine with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in outpatients presenting with either P falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria or both in Papua Indonesia from a low-to-mid level transmission area (entomological inoculation rate under 10). Each study has unique aspects. Zongo and colleagues found that amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was just as effective as artemether-lumefantrine in treating uncomplicated P falciparum infection and contested the notion that all antimalarial combinations should contain an artemisinin-based drug. Besides an equivalent effectiveness in clearing P falciparum infection the three-drug combination is much less expensive is much more readily available at least for the foreseeable future and in West Africa resistance to both amodiaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is relatively uncommon. Monotherapy for malaria is no longer acceptable and it is important to continue to consider effective combination antimalarials that may be alternatives to artemisinin-containing combinations.

The parasitic dinoflagellates of marine crustaceans.,"Parasitic dinoflagellates have recently emerged as significant disease agents of commer- cially important crustaceans. For example, epizootics of Hematodinium have seriously affected cer- tain crab and lobster fisheries. The parasitic dinoflagellates of crustaceans are, however, relatively unknown. Marine crustaceans are parasitized by two orders of dinoflagellates: the Blastodinida and the Syndinida. Crustaceans are also parasitized by the Paradinida and the Ellobiopsidae, taxa that have close historical ties and possible taxonomic affinities with the dinoflagellates. The taxonomy and life history patterns of the different parasitic species are largely dictated by their host-parasite rela- tionships. For example, sporulation in the blastodinids occurs internally but is completed externally with the expulsion of spores via the anus of the host. The egg-parasitic chytriodinids sporulate externally after destroying their host egg. The tissue-dwelling syndinids have plasmodia that sporu- late internally and generally kill their hosts upon the expulsion of the dinospores. Unfortunately, complete life cycles have not been elucidated for any of the parasitic forms, hence characteristics of the life cycles must be applied cautiously to the systematics of the taxa. For example, gamogony and the presence of resting cysts are only known from a few species; they probably occur in most species. Further work on the life cycles of the parasitic dinoflagellates of crustaceans should con- centrate on establishing the life cycles of representative species from each order or family. Parasitic dinoflagellates infect copepods, amphipods, mysids, euphausiids, and decapods. Their pathogenicity varies with their invasiveness in the host. The gut-dwelling blastodinids are relatively benign, while the chytriodinids kill their host egg. Members of the pervasive Syndinida and Paradinida are overtly pathogenic and insidiously ramify throughout the hemal sinuses and organs of their hosts. Members of the Ellobiopsidae vary from the commensal Ellobiocystis to the overtly parasitic Thulassomyces. Host castration and feminization are common pathologic results of infection by these parasites. The severity of the castration is dependent upon the invasiveness of the parasitic species and the duration of the infection, while the degree of feminization is related to the stage at which the host acquires the infection. Most of the parasitic dinoflagellates occur in epizootics in their host popula- tions. Recent epizootics of Hematodinium spp. have had severe effects on crustacean fisheries in Alaska, Virginia, and Scotland, and may potentially result in changes to the benthic communities of the hosts. The epizootics are often associated with host-parasite systems that occur in regions with unique hydrological features, such as fjords or poorly draining estuaries with shallow sills. These regions are ideal for the application of a ""landscape"" ecology approach that could lead to a better understanding of the epizootiology of parasitic dinoflagellates and other marine pathogens.",1994,Annual Review of Fish Diseases
Abstract 2518: Accumulation of a liver- and microbiome-derived metabolite in human breast tumors is associated with patient survival,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States. Gene expression profiling studies of breast tumors led to the discovery of disease subtypes with different biologies. These studies also described novel biomarkers for therapy response and disease survival. However, it remains a challenge to define breast cancer biology solely based on gene expression. Recently, metabolomics emerged as a new discovery tool with the promise of identifying prognostic biomarkers and targetable metabolic dependencies of cancer cells. We previously measured the abundance of 536 metabolites in 67 breast tumor and their tumor adjacent noncancerous tissue by untargeted mass spectrometry. In the current study, we explored the prognostic power of the metabolome and conducted an integrated analysis comprising of the metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome to explore the association of metabolites with cell systems, tumor biology, and disease outcome. We built a predictive model based on multivariable Cox proportional hazards using the L1 penalized log partial likelihood (LASSO) method after pre-selecting prognostic metabolites following cross-validation with 1000 iterations. The median C-index was 0.73, indicating a certain robustness of metabolites as classifiers of breast cancer outcome. The models identified five metabolites including a bile acid-related metabolite, glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC), as the most frequently selected features and outcome markers among these metabolites. An increased GCDC tumor content was associated with improved patient survival. We corroborated the presence of GCDC and three other bile acids in the human breast tissues using absolute measurements and confirmed their occurrence in breast tumors. Because additional large-scale transcriptome and proteome data were available for the same tissue samples, we further characterized the tumors based on their GCDC abundance, which showed that cell cycle-related pathways were enriched for differently expressed genes and tumors with a high GCDC content tended to have a low cell proliferation score, indicating that accumulation of GCDC leads to growth inhibition. We also conducted a correlation analysis for the relationship between GCDC abundance with other metabolites and identified 51 metabolites that were significantly correlated with GCDC. In this analysis, metabolite abundance in the sterol/steroid pathway associated most strongly with the GCDC tissue content. Lastly, we evaluated the effect of bile acids on breast cancer cell lines. The data showed a strong reduction of cancer cell proliferation under bile acid treatment, consistent with the tumor data, and distinct changes in gene expression. In conclusion, we propose that integrated metabolomics can provide powerful prognostic information with GCDC being a novel prognostic marker in breast cancer because accumulation of GCDC reduces cancer cell proliferation.

Irritability uniquely predicts prefrontal cortex activation during preschool inhibitory control among all temperament domains: A LASSO approach,"&NA; Temperament, defined as individual variation in the reactivity and regulation of emotional, motor, and attentional processes, has been shown to influence emotional and cognitive development during the preschool period (ages 4â€“5). While relationships between temperament and neural activity have been investigated previously, these have typically investigated individual temperament dimensions selected ad hoc. Since significant correlations exist between various temperament dimensions, it remains unclear whether these findings would replicate while analyzing all temperament dimensions simultaneously. Using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), 4â€5â€yearâ€old children (N = 118) were administered a Go/Noâ€Go task to assess prefrontal cortex activation during inhibitory control. The relationship between PFC activation and all 15 temperament domains defined by the Children's Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) was assessed using automatic feature selection via LASSO regression. Results indicate that only the Anger/Frustration dimension was predictive of activation during the inhibitory control task. These findings support previous work showing relationships between irritability and prefrontal activation during executive function and extend those findings by demonstrating the specificity of the activationâ€irritability relationship among temperament dimensions. Graphical abstract Figure. No caption available. HighlightsPFC activation was assessed in 118 preschool children during Go/Noâ€Go using fNIRS.Reaction time increase predicted inhibitory controlâ€related activation increase.All 15 CBQ temperament dimensions were entered as predictors into a LASSO model.The LASSO selected only Anger/Frustration as a significant predictor of activation.",2019,NeuroImage
"Thalassochytrium Gracilariopsidis (chytridiomycota), Gen. Et Sp. Nov., Endosymbiotic in Gracilariopsis Sp. (rhodophyceae)","Thalassochytrium gracilariopsidis gen. et sp. nov. is an endosymbiotic, polycentric, zoosporic fungus that infected cultures of the red alga Gracilariopsis sp. Based on the posteriorly uniflagellate zoospore and the platelike cristae of the mitochondria, the fungus is placed in the Chytridiomycota. Ultrastructurally, the fungal zoospore is distinguished by the anterior position of the kinetosome, a unique microbody-lipid globule complex, an electron-opaque helix associated with the kinetosome and lipid globules, and a beaked nucleus. Zoospores are positively phototactic, and the unusual helix might constitute part of the photosensory apparatus. Zoospores lack certain taxonomically important structures, such as a rumposome, props, a nonflagellated kinetosome, and flagellar roots. The organism does not fit into any described genus, and the features of its zoospore differ from those of any described order. The fungal thallus is polycentric with multinucleate, septate hyphae. Haustoria form within the algal cells. The fungus does not appear to cause major harm to its host and seems to be host specific. However, during intense sporulation of the fungus, degradation of host chloroplasts was observed in medullary cells.",1999,Journal of Phycology
Knowing the Sea: Thalassographies to Thalassology of the Indian Ocean (up to c. 1500 CE),"This essay attempts to outline the broad patterns of the knowledge about the Indian Ocean, the third largest maritime space in the world, up to c. 1500 CE. A particular form of knowing the sea (an artisanal epistemology) emanated from the experiences of the ship-builders, sailors, captains and navigators, who rarely left any written manual on their understanding of the sea. The paper will look at different nomenclatures of this maritime space (or parts thereof), captured in various literary texts of diverse times and areas, as alternate impressions of thalassography. The epigraphic evidence of Indic seafaring and the Jewish geniza documents portrays the voyagerâ€™s views of the Ocean. The transition from thalassography to thalassology of the Indian Ocean coincided with growing thalassocratic aspirations in post-1500 times.",2019,
2 Regularization Methods for Grouped Variable Selection,"In this study, we consider several regularization path algorithms with grouped variable selection for modeling gene-interactions. When fitting with categorical factors, including the genotype measurements, we often define a set of dummy variables that represent a single factor/interaction of factors. Yuan & Lin (2006) proposed the groupLars and the group-Lasso methods through which these groups of indicators can be selected simultaneously. Here we introduce another version of group-Lars. In addition, we propose a path-following algorithm for the group-Lasso method applied to generalized linear models. We then use all these path algorithms, which select the grouped variables in a smooth way, to identify gene-interactions affecting disease status in an example. We further compare their performances to that of L2 penalized logistic regression with forward stepwise variable selection discussed in Park & Hastie (2006b).",2006,
Robust 3D MIMO-OFDM channel estimation with hybrid analog-digital architecture,"We consider the problem of 3D multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) channel estimation, a key for the future development of 3D beamforming techniques. Our main contribution is a novel algorithm, namely the adaptive-LASSO, that can jointly exploit the sparsity structure of the MIMO-OFDM channel in the spatial and delay domains. The algorithm is designed to handle large antenna arrays by means of a hybrid analog-digital architecture. In this regard, we describe an effective beam-switching strategy to sample the channel using a few analog beamformers. We investigate the impact of the signal bandwidth, antenna structures, line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions via ray-tracing based simulations. Also, we show that the A-LASSO can provide significant improvements with respect to the legacy methods, e.g. least-square technique.",2016,2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
Adaptive First-Order Methods for General Sparse Inverse Covariance Selection,"In this paper we consider estimating sparse inverse covariance of a Gaussian graphical model whose conditional independence is assumed to be partially known. Similarly as in [A. d'Aspremont, O. Banerjee, and L. El Ghaoui, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 30 (2008), pp. 56-66; M. Yuan and Y. Lin, Biometrika, 94 (2007), pp. 19-35], we formulate it as an $l_1$-norm penalized maximum likelihood estimation problem. Further, we propose an algorithm framework, and develop two first-order methods, that is, the adaptive spectral projected gradient (ASPG) method and the adaptive Nesterov's smooth (ANS) method, for solving this estimation problem. Finally, we compare the performance of these two methods with glasso [J. Friedman, T. Hastie, and R. Tibshirani, Biostatistics, 9 (2008), pp. 432-441; J. Friedman, T. Hastie, and R. Tibshirani, Glasso: Graphical Lasso for R, Software package, Department of Statistics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 2007] on a set of randomly generated instances. Our computational results demonstrate that our methods are capable of solving problems of size at least a thousand and number of constraints of nearly a half million within a reasonable amount of time, and moreover, that the ASPG method generally outperforms the ANS method and glasso.",2010,SIAM J.

A marine algicidal Thalassospira and its active substance against the harmful algal bloom species Karenia mikimotoi,"The aim of the present study was to obtain a marine bacterium active against Karenia mikimotoi from the East China Sea and to characterize its extracellular algicidal substances. Using preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC) and electrospray ionization/quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer coupled with a high-performance liquid chromatography (LC/MS-Q-TOF) system, we purified the alga-lysing substance produced by strain ZR-2 and determined its molecular structure. Based on morphology and l6S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence analysis, the ZR-2 strain was highly homologous to Thalassospira species. Algicidal activity against K. mikimotoi was detected in the cell-free filtrate but not in bacterial cells. The alga-lysing substance produced by ZR-2 was ethanol-soluble and thermostable, with a retention time of 6.3Â min and a measured elemental composition of C7H5O2 ([Mâ€“H]âˆ’ ion at m/z 121.0295). The alga-lysing substance produced by ZR-2 was determined to be benzoic acid. Compared with the negative control, both purified ZR-2 bacteria-free filtrate and standard benzoic acid promoted K. mikimotoi cell disruption and induced K. mikimotoi cell content leakage. Our study is the first to report benzoic acid activity against K. mikimotoi as well as production of benzoic acid by a Thalassospira species.",2016,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology

Bio-statistical approaches to evaluate the link between specific nutrients and methylation patterns in a breast cancer case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. (Approches bio-statistiques pour Ã©valuer le lien entre nutriments et ,"Epigenetics data are challenging sets characterized by hundreds of thousands of features. The main objective of this thesis was to evaluate the performance of some of the existing statistical methods to handle sets of large dimension data, exploring the association between dietary factors related to breast cancer (BC) and DNA methylation within the EPIC study.In order to investigate the characteristics of epigenetics data, the identification of random and systematic sources of variability of methylation measurements was attempted, via the principal component partial R-square (PC-PR2) method. Using this technique, the performance of three popular normalization techniques to correct for unwanted sources of variability was evaluated by quantifying epigenetics variability attributed to laboratory factors before and after the application of each correction method.Once a suitable normalization procedure was identified, the association between alcohol intake, dietary folate and methylation levels was examined by means of three approaches: an analysis of individual CpG sites, of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and using fused lasso regression. The last two methods aim at the identification of specific regions of the epigenome using the potential correlation between neighboring CpG sites. Global methylation levels were used to investigate the relationship between methylation and BC risk.By performing an exhaustive evaluation of the statistical tools used to disclose complexity of DNA methylation data, this thesis provides informative insights for studies focusing on epigenetics, with promising potentials to apply similar methodology to the analysis of other -omics data",2018,

Modern Statistical Methods,"In this course we will study a selection of important modern statistical methods. This selection is heavily biased towards my own interests, but I hope it will nevertheless give you a flavour of some of the most important recent methodological developments in statistics. Over the last 25 years, the sorts of datasets that statisticians have been challenged to study have changed greatly. Where in the past, we were used to datasets with many observations with a few carefully chosen variables, we are now seeing datasets where the number of variables can run into the thousands and greatly exceed the number of observations. For example, with microarray data, we typically have gene expression values measured for several thousands of genes, but only for a few hundred tissue samples. The classical statistical methods are often simply not applicable in these â€œhigh-dimensionalâ€ situations. The course is divided into 4 chapters (of unequal size). Our first chapter will start by introducing ridge regression, a simple generalisation of ordinary least squares. Our study of this will lead us to some beautiful connections with functional analysis and ultimately one of the most successful and flexible classes of learning algorithms: kernel machines. The second chapter concerns the Lasso and its extensions. The Lasso has been at the centre of much of the developments that have occurred in high-dimensional statistics, and will allow us to perform regression in the seemingly hopeless situation when the number of parameters we are trying to estimate is larger than the number of observations. In the third chapter we will study graphical modelling and provide an introduction to the exciting field of causal inference. Where the previous chapters consider methods for relating a particular response to a large collection of (explanatory) variables, graphical modelling will give us a way of understanding relationships between the variables themselves. Ultimately we would like to infer causal relationships between variables based on (observational) data. This may seem like a fundamentally impossible task, yet we will show how by developing the graphical modelling framework further, we can begin to answer such causal questions. Statistics is not only about developing methods that can predict well in the presence of noise, but also about assessing the uncertainty in our predictions and estimates. In the final chapter we will tackle the problem of how to handle performing thousands of hypothesis tests at the same time and more generally the task of quantifying uncertainty in high-dimensional settings. Before we begin the course proper, we will briefly review two key classical statistical methods: ordinary least squares and maximum likelihood estimation. This will help to set the scene and provide a warm-up for the modern methods to come later.",2017,
Beyond Early Warning Indicators: High School Dropout and Machine Learning,"This paper provides an algorithm to predict which students are going to drop out of high schools relying only on information from 9th grade. It verifies that using a parsimonious early warning system - as implemented in many schools - leads to poor results. It shows that schools can obtain more precise predictions by exploiting the available high-dimensional data jointly with machine learning tools such as Support Vector Machine, Boosted Regression and Post-LASSO. It carefully selects goodness-of-fit criteria based on the context and the underlying theoretical framework: model parameters are calibrated by taking into account policy goals and budget constraints. Finally, it uses unsupervised machine learning to divide students at risk of dropping out into different clusters.",2019,Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics
Variable selection for multiply-imputed data with penalized generalized estimating equations,"Generalized estimating equations (GEE) are useful tools for marginal regression analysis for longitudinal data. Having a high number of variables along with the presence of missing data presents complex issues when working in a longitudinal context. In variable selection for instance, penalized generalized estimating equations have not been systematically developed to integrate missing data. The MI-PGEE: multiple imputation-penalized generalized estimating equations, an extension of the multiple imputation-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (MI-LASSO) is presented. MI-PGEE allows integration of missing data and within-subject correlation in variable selection procedures. Missing data are dealt with using multiple imputation, and variable selection is performed using a group LASSO penalty. Estimated coefficients for the same variable across multiply-imputed datasets are considered as a group while applying penalized generalized estimating equations, leading to a unique model across multiply-imputed datasets. In order to select the tuning parameter, a new BIC-like criterion is proposed. In a simulation study, the advantage of using MI-PGEE compared to simple imputation PGEE is shown. The usefulness of the new method is illustrated by an application to a subgroup of the placebo arm of the strontium ranelate efficacy in knee osteoarthritis trial study.",2017,Comput. Stat.

Abundance and Diversity of Crypto- and Necto-Benthic Coastal Fish Are Higher in Marine Forests than in Structurally Less Complex Macroalgal Assemblages,"In Mediterranean subtidal rocky reefs, Cystoseira spp. (Phaeophyceae) form dense canopies up to 1 m high. Such habitats, called 'Cystoseira forests', are regressing across the entire Mediterranean Sea due to multiple anthropogenic stressors, as are other large brown algae forests worldwide. Cystoseira forests are being replaced by structurally less complex habitats, but little information is available regarding the potential difference in the structure and composition of fish assemblages between these habitats. To fill this void, we compared necto-benthic (NB) and crypto-benthic (CB) fish assemblage structures between Cystoseira forests and two habitats usually replacing the forests (turf and barren), in two sampling regions (Corsica and Menorca). We sampled NB fish using Underwater Visual Census (UVC) and CB fish using Enclosed Anaesthetic Station Vacuuming (EASV), since UVC is known to underestimate the diversity and density of the 'hard to spot' CB fish. We found that both taxonomic diversity and total density of NB and CB fish were highest in Cystoseira forests and lowest in barrens, while turfs, that could be sampled only at Menorca, showed intermediate values. Conversely, total biomass of NB and CB fish did not differ between habitats because the larger average size of fish in barrens (and turfs) compensated for their lower densities. The NB families Labridae and Serranidae, and the CB families Blenniidae, Cliniidae, Gobiidae, Trypterigiidae and Scorpaenidae, were more abundant in forests. The NB taxa Diplodus spp. and Thalassoma pavo were more abundant in barrens. Our study highlights the importance of using EASV for sampling CB fish, and shows that Cystoseira forests support rich and diversified fish assemblages. This evidence suggests that the ongoing loss of Cystoseira forests may impair coastal fish assemblages and related goods and services to humans, and stresses the need to implement strategies for the successful conservation and/or recovery of marine forests.",2016,PLoS ONE
DNA-based identification methods of prey fish from stomach contents of 12 species of eastern North Pacific groundfish,"Abstract Stomach content analysis of eastern North Pacific groundfish has been conducted routinely by researchers interested in understanding trophic interactions between key predator species and their prey. Identification of prey by traditional morphological methods has limitations however, due to the loss of identifiable characters from digestion and morphological similarities between taxa. Furthermore, some forage fish ( e.g ., osmerids, ammodytids, and juvenile gadids), common prey of Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska groundfish, are difficult to distinguish because of their slender or fusiform shape, disarticulating easily during digestion. DNA-based identification methods were developed to differentiate among 18 fish species, some that are found at depths greater than 200Â m, from four taxonomic families: Ammodytidae and Osmeridae (forage fish), Pleuronectidae (flatfish), and Gadidae (gadid fish). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a 739 basepair section of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase I and an 862 basepair section of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b was followed by restriction digest assays and resulted in species level resolution for 16 of 18 species of interest. PCR restriction digest assays applied to fish prey from stomach contents of groundfish indicated the presence of several target species, eulachon ( Thaleichthys pacificus ), walleye pollock ( Gadus chalcogrammus ), searcher ( Bathymaster signatus ), rock sole ( Lepidopsetta bilineata ), yellowfin sole ( Limanda aspera ) and either Bering flounder ( Hippoglossoides robustus ) or flathead sole ( H. elassodon ). The PCR restriction digest protocols improved the identification rate of predated fish from stomach contents compared to identification by conventional taxonomic methods alone, and DNA sequence analysis further resolved identification of unknown prey fish samples.",2014,
Grayscale Ultrasound Radiomic Features and Shear-Wave Elastography Radiomic Features in Benign and Malignant Breast Masses.,"PURPOSE
â€‚To identify and compare diagnostic performance of radiomic features between grayscale ultrasound (US) and shear-wave elastography (SWE) in breast masses.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
â€‚We retrospectively collected 328Â pathologically confirmed breast masses in 296 women who underwent grayscale US and SWE before biopsy or surgery. A representative SWE image of the mass displayed with a grayscale image in split-screen mode was selected. An ROI was delineated around the mass boundary on the grayscale image and copied and pasted to the SWE image by a dedicated breast radiologist for lesion segmentation. A total of 730 candidate radiomic features including first-order statistics and textural and wavelet features were extracted from each image. LASSO regression was used for data dimension reduction and feature selection. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent radiomic features, differentiating between benign and malignant masses with calculation of the AUC.


RESULTS
â€‚Of 328 breast masses, 205 (62.5â€Š%) were benign and 123 (37.5â€Š%) were malignant. Following radiomic feature selection, 22 features from grayscale and 6 features from SWE remained. On univariate analysis, all 6 SWE radiomic features (Pâ€Š<â€Š0.0001) and 21 of 22 grayscale radiomic features (Pâ€Š<â€Š0.03) were significantly different between benign and malignant masses. After multivariate analysis, three grayscale radiomic features and two SWE radiomic features were independently associated with malignant breast masses. The AUC was 0.929 for grayscale US and 0.992 for SWE (Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001).


CONCLUSION
â€‚US radiomic features may have the potential to improve diagnostic performance for breast masses, but further investigation of independent and larger datasets is needed.",2019,Ultraschall in der Medizin
A dated molecular phylogeny for the Chironomidae (Diptera),"We provide the first highly sampled phylogeny estimate for the dipteran family Chironomidae using molecular data from fragments of two ribosomal genes (18S and 28S), one nuclear protein-coding gene (CAD), and one mitochondrial protein-coding gene (COI), analysed using mixed-model Bayesian and maximum likelihood inference methods. The most recently described subfamilies Chilenomyiinae and Usambaromyiinae proved elusive, and are unsampled. We confirm monophyly of all sampled subfamilies except Prodiamesinae, which contains Propsilocerus Kieffer, previously in Orthocladiinae. The semifamily Chironomoinae is confirmed only if Telmatogetoninae is included, which is closer to Brundin's original suggestion. Buchonomyiinae is excluded from Chironomoinae: it is a sister group to all remaining Chironomidae, conforming more to Murray and Ashe's argumentation. Semifamily Tanypodoinae is a grade and unsupported as monophyletic: the austral Aphroteniinae alone is sister to all Chironomidae (less Buchonomyiinae). Podonominae is weakly supported as the next sister group, in contrast to some estimates that place this subfamily as sister group to Tanypodinae alone. In Diamesinae, the southern African Harrisonini is confirmed as a member, but embedded within austral tribe Heptagiini, which is confirmed as sister to the undersampled Diamesini. Tribe Pentaneurini and â€˜non-Pentaneuriniâ€™ taxa are reciprocally monophyletic in Tanypodinae. Recent molecular findings concerning Podonominae are substantiated, with a monophyletic tribe Podonomini, Boreochlini forming a grade and Lasiodiamesa Kieffer placed as sister to all other Podonominae, but with uncertainty. In Orthocladiinae, a postulated two-tribe system of Orthocladiini and Metriocnemini can be supported after exclusion of a Corynoneura group and a Brillia group, which is revealed as sister to Stictocladius Edwards. The marine Clunio Haliday and Thalassosmittia Strenzke & Remmert (given high rank in the past) are clearly embedded deep in Orthocladiinae. The finding of Shangomyia Saether & Wang + Xyiaomyia Saether & Wang as sister group to all other Chironominae justifies high rank, as their authors suggested. Pseudochironomini (untested by sampling shortfall) is sister to a monophyletic Tanytarsini (with a weakly supported inclusion of the enigmatic Nandeva Wiedenbrug, Reiss & Fittkau). The tribe Chironomini can be supported only by excluding Shangomyia + Xyiaomyia, and a postulated monophyletic clade comprising several taxa such as Microtendipes Kieffer, with six-segmented larval antennae and alternate Lauterborn organs, that is sister group to Pseudochironomini + Tanytarsini. The tempo of diversification of the family, deduced by divergence time analysis (beast), shows Permian origination with subfamily stem-group origination from the midâ€“late Triassic to the early Cretaceous. Crown-group origination ranged from Podonominae on a short stem originating in the mid Jurassic to long-stemmed Aphroteninae from the late Cretaceous. Node dates allow inference of some vicariance via Gondwanan fragmentation, including certain nodes involving southern Africa.",2012,Systematic Entomology
Predicting Days on Market to Optimize Real Estate Sales Strategy,"Irregularities and frauds are frequent in the real estate market in Bulgaria due to the substantial lack of rigorous legislation. For instance, agencies frequently publish unreal or unavailable apartment listings for a cheap price, as a method to attract the attention of unaware potential new customers. For this reason, systems able to identify unreal listings and improve the transparency of listings authenticity and availability are much on demand. Recent research has highlighted that the number of days a published listing remains online can have a strong correlation with the probability of a listing being unreal. For this reason, building an accurate predictive model for the number of days a published listing will be online can be very helpful to accomplish the task of identifying fake listings. In this paper, we investigate the use of four different machine learning algorithms for this task: Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, and Artificial Neural Networks. The results, obtained on a vast dataset made available by the Bulgarian company Homeheed, show the appropriateness of Lasso regression.",2020,Complexity
"High concordance of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genotypes between matched peripheral and placental isolates of delivered women in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","Whether maternal peripheral parasites constitute a representative sample of the overall population infecting the individual, remains unknown in Burkina Faso. We therefore compared Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genotypes between matched peripheral and placental isolates. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)
analysis of polymorphic codons of the Pfdhfr gene (51, 59, 108 and 164) and the Pfdhps gene (437 and 540) was performed in 18 matched peripheral and placental dried blood spots of delivered women in Bobo-Dioulasso. Both Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes were successfully genotyped in 94.4% (17/18) of the matched samples. Only 8.8% (3/34) of genotypes were of the wild type, while 20.6% (7/34), 20.6% (7/34), 23.5% (8/34) and 26.5% (9/34) comprised one, two, three and four mutations, respectively. None of the samples carried both Pfdhfr I164L and Pfdhps K540E mutations. A concordance of 82.4% was observed in matched samples for both the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes. Setting placental alleles as the reference, a concordance of 100% was obtained with Pfdhfr mutation S108N, Pfdhfr mutation C59R+S108N, and Pfdhfr mutation N51I+C59R +S108N, respectively. Likewise, a concordance of 85.7% was observed with the Pfdhps mutation A437G.

Isolation and Identification of Multi Drug Resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Causing Wound Infection in Erbil City,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a G-negative bacteria belonging to the proteobacteria phylum [1]. P. aeruginosais one of the most virulent opportunistic infectious agent of man [2].Which involved in hospital infections and causing illness in immunocomprised patients One of the major causes of serious infections in burn patients, resulting in mortality as high as 50% [3]. P.aeruginosa is primarily a nosocomial pathogen. According to the centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC), the overall incidence of P.aeruginosa infection in United States hospital averages about 0.4 percent ( 4 per 1000 discharges ), and the bacterium is the fourth most commonly â€“ isolated nosocomial pathogen accounting for 10.1 percent of all hospitalacquired infection .It has been estimated that about ten percent of all hospitalacquired infections are caused by P. aeruginosa, and for immune-compromised patients the mortality rate range from 20 to 70 % [4].When pathogenic bacteria are entering host tissue, different substances called virulence factors are released from the bacteria. Virulence factors cause damage to tissues through toxicity and invasiveness and allow for establishment of bacteria. P. aeruginosa produce a variety of virulence factors, both extracellular and cellassociated products. [5]. Pyocyanin is the major phenazine pigment produced by P. aeruginosaand has been shown to contribute to its pathogenicity. The presence of pyocyanin is easy to detect due to its blue color that turns stationary phase cultures of P. aeruginosa green, and is commonly found to stain infected tissues, pus, or dressings [6].

"Composition and Ecological Diversity of the Ichthyofauna from the Namorados Dam, Semi Arid Region of ParaÃ­ba, Brazil","The aim of this study was to characterize the composition and ecological diversity of the ichthyofauna from the Namorados Dam, in the semi arid region of Paraiba, northeastern Brazil. Samples were collected between January 2006 and July 2007, in morning and afternoon shifts, using different fishing gear. Ecological diversity was calculated using diversity indexes of Shannon-Wiener (H'), richness (D') and evenness (J'), using the average abundance of the species. 176 individuals were collected throughout the analyzed period, being represented by 2 orders, 4 families of 5 species. With the exception of January 2006, the composition did not show specific changes, with equal predominance of the species Cichlassoma orientale and Steindachnerina notonota. Throughout the period of 2007, the prevalence was of the Order Perciformes, with dominance of the species C. orientale, which may have been caused by a population decline of Oreochromis niloticus. The lower diversity observed (H'=0,46) was due to the lower species richness (3) and the predominance of the species C. orientale in the same period. During the rainy seasons of 2006 and 2007 low diversity indexes were registered (H'=0,60 e H'=0,46) due to lower species richness (2 and 3), and dominance of O. niloticus and C. orientale. The dry season presented an average diversity of H'=0,90, which corresponds to a slight increase in species richness (5). We conclude that in this environment there is a weak annual variation in the fish assemblage, as well as in the species richness associated with seasonality of the region.",2016,
Guaranteed Sufficient Decrease for Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient Optimization,"In this paper, we propose a novel sufficient decrease technique for stochastic variance reduced gradient descent methods such as SVRG and SAGA. In order to make sufficient decrease for stochastic optimization, we design a new sufficient decrease criterion, which yields sufficient decrease versions of stochastic variance reduction algorithms such as SVRG-SD and SAGA-SD as a byproduct. We introduce a coefficient to scale current iterate and to satisfy the sufficient decrease property, which takes the decisions to shrink, expand or even move in the opposite direction, and then give two specific update rules of the coefficient for Lasso and ridge regression. Moreover, we analyze the convergence properties of our algorithms for strongly convex problems, which show that our algorithms attain linear convergence rates. We also provide the convergence guarantees of our algorithms for non-strongly convex problems. Our experimental results further verify that our algorithms achieve significantly better performance than their counterparts.",2018,
Sparsity control for robust principal component analysis,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used for high-dimensional data analysis, with well-documented applications in computer vision, preference measurement, and bioinformatics. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from variable selection and compressive sampling, to robustify PCA against outliers. A least-trimmed squares estimator of a low-rank component analysis model is shown closely related to that obtained from an â„“0-(pseudo)norm-regularized criterion encouraging sparsity in a matrix explicitly modeling the outliers. This connection suggests efficient (approximate) solvers based on convex relaxation, which lead naturally to a family of robust estimators subsuming Huber's optimal M-class. Outliers are identified by tuning a regularization parameter, which amounts to controlling the sparsity of the outlier matrix along the whole robustification path of (group)-Lasso solutions. Novel algorithms are developed to: i) estimate the low-rank data model both robustly and adaptively; and ii) determine principal components robustly in (possibly) infinite-dimensional feature spaces. Numerical tests corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed robust PCA scheme for a video surveillance task.",2010,"2010 Conference Record of the Forty Fourth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers"
[High infant mortality rates that can be substantially lowered].,"
 Between 1981-84 a survey (EMIS) on infant mortality was completed in the 5 major urban centers in Burkina Faso (Banfora, Bobo-Dioulasso, Koudougou, and Ouahigouya) and in Ouagadougou, the capital. The survey was done in 2 stages: 1) collecting a cohort of newborns either at home or at the maternities between April 1, 1981 and March 31, 1982; and 2) following up on these cohorts during their first 2 years of life (until March 31, 1984). 2 questionnaires were used, the 1st one to collect basic data while the 2nd one was used during the follow-up home-visits. The methodology did not include all newborns as planned in all of the centers due to a number of problems including migration; however, for Bobo-Dioulasso the survey did cover 80% of all newborns. The estimated results of the survey should be considered a ""real indication"" of infant mortality rates (IMR) for ages 2 years for those centers covered in the survey. General estimates for IMR for all selected centers is around 100/1000. In 1976 IMR was estimated at 176/1000 while in 1985 it was 134/1000. The major causes of death are: 1) diarrhea--affecting 1 out of 4 infants under 2; and 2) measles. The tragedy is that deaths from both these illnesses are preventable--diarrhea with oral rehydration therapy and measles with vaccinations. There is a need to mount national health and vaccination campaigns to include the rural areas where the majority of the population live.

"A neo-rationalist tendency in the field of the literary intellectual in 1970s Italy: Vittorini, Sciascia, Ginzburg","The article examines a constellation of intellectuals working in 1960s and 1970s Italy who are neither aligned with the extreme political projects of those years nor symptomatic of the perceived collapse in relations between high culture and politics in this period. Instead, Vittorini, Sciascia and Carlo Ginzburg are taken as illustrations of a fertile 'neo-rationalist' tendency in culture-politics relations, at once a reprise of strands from the Enlightenment, an attempt to move beyond Marxist cultural politics and a response to the spread of new intellectual disciplines. Vittorini is shown as laying the groundwork for this tendency, and Sciascia and Ginzburg as putting it into practice through hybrid discourses between narrative, politics, law and history. Finally connections are suggested between this tendency and a longer line of liberal intellectual practice, going at least as far back as the Partito d'azione group of the 1930s and 1940s. L'articolo prende in considerazione un gruppo di intellettuali italiani tra gli anni sessanta e settanta i quali non sono nÃ¨ allineati con i progetti politici piÃ¹ estremisti di quegli anni, nÃ¨ sintomatici di una sensazione di collasso imminente nei rapporti tra la cultura di alto profilo ed il mondo della politica, in questo periodo. Al contrario, Vittorini, Sciascia e Carlo Ginzburg sono qui considerati come promotori di una fertile tendenza 'neo razionalista' nei rapporti tra cultura e politica, caratterizzata da un unico tentativo di riappropriarsi di alcuni aspetti dell'illuminismo, di proiettarsi al di lÃ€ di una cultura politica marxista e di rispondere alla diffusione di nuove discipline intellettuali. Vittorini viene qui considerato come il fondatore di questa tendenza, mentre Sciascia e Ginzburg sono indicati come i prosecutori di questo modello culturale ibrido, prodotto dal convergere di varie discipline: narrative letterarie, politiche, legali e storiche. Infine, vengono indicate connessioni tra questa tendenza 'neo razionalista' ed una piÃ¹ ampia e tradizionale cultura intellettuale e liberale, che ha le sue origini nel gruppo del Partito d'azione negli anni trenta e quaranta.",2001,Journal of Modern Italian Studies
Identifying neuroanatomical signatures of anorexia nervosa: a multivariate machine learning approach.,"BACKGROUND
There are currently no neuroanatomical biomarkers of anorexia nervosa (AN) available to make clinical inferences at an individual subject level. We present results of a multivariate machine learning (ML) approach utilizing structural neuroanatomical scan data to differentiate AN patients from matched healthy controls at an individual subject level.


METHOD
Structural neuroimaging scans were acquired from 15 female patients with AN (age = 20, s.d. = 4 years) and 15 demographically matched female controls (age = 22, s.d. = 3 years). Neuroanatomical volumes were extracted using the FreeSurfer software and input into the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) multivariate ML algorithm. LASSO was 'trained' to identify 'novel' individual subjects as either AN patients or healthy controls. Furthermore, the model estimated the probability that an individual subject belonged to the AN group based on an individual scan.


RESULTS
The model correctly predicted 25 out of 30 subjects, translating into 83.3% accuracy (sensitivity 86.7%, specificity 80.0%) (p < 0.001; Ï‡ 2 test). Six neuroanatomical regions (cerebellum white matter, choroid plexus, putamen, accumbens, the diencephalon and the third ventricle) were found to be relevant in distinguishing individual AN patients from healthy controls. The predicted probabilities showed a linear relationship with drive for thinness clinical scores (r = 0.52, p < 0.005) and with body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.45, p = 0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
The model achieved a good predictive accuracy and drive for thinness showed a strong neuroanatomical signature. These results indicate that neuroimaging scans coupled with ML techniques have the potential to provide information at an individual subject level that might be relevant to clinical outcomes.",2015,Psychological medicine
A multipredictor model to predict the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimerâ€™s disease by using a predictive nomogram,"Predicting the probability of converting from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is still a challenging task. This study aims at providing a personalized MCI-to-AD conversion estimation by using a multipredictor nomogram that integrates neuroimaging features, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker, and clinical assessments. To do so, 290 MCI patients were collected from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), of whom 76 has converted to AD and 214 remained with MCI. All subjects were randomly divided into a primary and validation cohort. Radiomics signature (Rad-sig) was obtained based on 17 cerebral cortex features selected by using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm. Clinical factors and amyloid-beta peptide (AÎ²) concentration were selected by using Spearman correlation between the converted and not-converted patients. Then, a nomogram that combines image features, clinical factor, and AÎ² concentration was constructed and validated. Furthermore, we explored the associations between various predictors from the macro- to the microperspective by assessing gene expression patterns. Our results showed that the multipredictor nomogram (C-index 0.978 and 0.956 in both cohorts, respectively) outperformed the nomogram using either Rad-sig or AÎ² concentration as individual predictors. Significant associations were found between neuropsychological scores, cerebral cortex features, AÎ² levels, and underlying gene pathways. Our study may have a clinical impact as a powerful predictive tool for predicting the conversion probability of MCI and providing associations between cognitive impairment, structural changes, AÎ² levels, and underlying biological patterns from the macro- to the microperspective.",2019,Neuropsychopharmacology
Endoscopic removal of a broken self-expandable metal stent using the stent-in-stent technique.,"A 55-year-old man with dysphagia due to an unresectable distal esophageal adenocarcinoma underwent placement of a 15-cm partially covered self-expandable metal stent (SEMS), diameter 18mm (Ultraflex; Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). After 3 months, he presented with recurrent dysphagia. At endoscopy, the meshes of the SEMS had broken, leading to collapse of the SEMS and obstruction of the lumen (â—"" Fig.1). Because the patientâ€™s clinical condition had improved and further treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy was considered, we decided to remove the SEMS using the stent-in-stent technique. A second SEMS, 17-cm long, fully covered, diameter 20mm (Hanaro, M. I.Tech, Korea) was inserted, overlapping the full length of the first SEMS. After 2 weeks, on endoscopic examination, the loose struts of the disrupted SEMS had perforated the covering of the fully covered SEMS, and the radial pressure of the fully covered SEMS had succeeded in detaching the partially covered SEMS from the esophageal wall and tumor (â—"" Fig.2). By pulling the proximal retrieval lasso of the fully covered SEMS, both SEMSs were extracted simultaneously without the need to exert much force. Examination of the retrieved stents showed they were strongly attached to each other, indeed with loose struts of the first stent perforating the covering of the fully covered SEMS (â—"" Fig.3). Immediately after removal of both stents, no esophageal stenosis was observed. The post-procedural course was uneventful, and the patient is currently without dysphagia. Spontaneous fracture with collapse of an esophageal SEMS is a rare complication [1,2]. However, if a SEMS is extracted by pulling its upper or lower end, and traction is forceful, as in the case of (partial) stent ingrowth, the struts may break causing the metal wire mesh to become disrupted. When the struts are already broken, it seems likely that by pulling on one end of the SEMS, the metal framework will be destroyed even further, making it impossible to remove the SEMS all in one. In such cases, the stent-in-stent technique is a simple and safe method to facilitate removal of embedded stents in benign disease [3]. This is the first report of removal of a broken SEMS using the stent-in-stent technique. It appears to be simple, safe and effective, also in malignant disease.",2012,Endoscopy
Performance Evaluation of Phase Corrected LASSO Algorithm in SSVEP-Based BCI systems,"SSVEP-based BCI systems have attracted attention of many researchers due to their high signal to noise ratio, high information transfer rate and being easy for use. The processing goal of these systems is to detect the stimulus frequency of EEG signal. Among the processing methods for frequency identification in SSVEP-based BCI systems, LASSO algorithm has gained great acceptance. Although LASSO has acceptable performance in SSVEP-based BCI systems, it doesn't consider the phase of recorded EEG signal for creating the reference signal. In this paper, the idea of correcting the phase of the reference signal with respect to recorded EEG signal was investigated and a new method called phase corrected LASSO was proposed. For this purpose, first, the optimal EEG channel for frequency identification was determined and then, the performance of the phase corrected LASSO method was compared with standard LASSO method. The results show that the phase corrected LASSO method has better performance compared with the standard LASSO method.",2017,
Marginalized lasso in sparse regression,"Abstract We propose marginalized lasso, a new nonconvex penalization for variable selection in regression problem. The marginalized lasso penalty is motivated from integrating out the penalty parameter in the original lasso penalty with a gamma prior distribution. This study provides a thresholding rule and a lasso-based iterative algorithm for parameter estimation in the marginalized lasso. We also provide a coordinate descent algorithm to efficiently optimize the marginalized lasso penalized regression. Numerical comparison studies are provided to demonstrate its competitiveness over the existing sparsity-inducing penalizations and suggest some guideline for tuning parameter selection.",2019,Journal of The Korean Statistical Society
Traction force microscopy with optimized regularization and automated Bayesian parameter selection for comparing cells,"Adherent cells exert traction forces on to their environment which allows them to migrate, to maintain tissue integrity, and to form complex multicellular structures during developmental morphogenesis. Traction force microscopy (TFM) enables the measurement of traction forces on an elastic substrate and thereby provides quantitative information on cellular mechanics in a perturbation-free fashion. In TFM, traction is usually calculated via the solution of a linear system, which is complicated by undersampled input data, acquisition noise, and large condition numbers for some methods. Therefore, standard TFM algorithms either employ data filtering or regularization. However, these approaches require a manual selection of filter- or regularization parameters and consequently exhibit a substantial degree of subjectiveness. This shortcoming is particularly serious when cells in different conditions are to be compared because optimal noise suppression needs to be adapted for every situation, which invariably results in systematic errors. Here, we systematically test the performance of new methods from computer vision and Bayesian inference for solving the inverse problem in TFM. We compare two classical schemes, L1- and L2-regularization, with three previously untested schemes, namely Elastic Net regularization, Proximal Gradient Lasso, and Proximal Gradient Elastic Net. Overall, we find that Elastic Net regularization, which combines L1 and L2 regularization, outperforms all other methods with regard to accuracy of traction reconstruction. Next, we develop two methods, Bayesian L2 regularization and Advanced Bayesian L2 regularization, for automatic, optimal L2 regularization. Using artificial data and experimental data, we show that these methods enable robust reconstruction of traction without requiring a difficult selection of regularization parameters specifically for each data set. Thus, Bayesian methods can mitigate the considerable uncertainty inherent in comparing cellular tractions in different conditions.",2019,Scientific Reports
Multisite Disease Classification with Functional Connectomes via Multitask Structured Sparse SVM,"There is great interest in developing imaging-based methods for diagnosing neuropsychiatric conditions. To this end, multiple datasharing initiatives have been launched in the neuroimaging field, where datasets are collected across multiple imaging sites. While this enables researchers to study the disorders of interest with substantial sample size, it also creates new challenges since the data aggregation process introduces various sources of site-specific heterogeneities. To address this issue, we introduce a multitask structured sparse support vector machine (SVM) that uses resting state functional connectomes (FCs) as the features for predicting diagnostic labels. Specifically, we employ a penalty that accounts for the following two-way structure that exists in a multisite FC dataset: (1) the 6-D spatial structure in the FCs captured via either the GraphNet, fused Lasso, or the isotropic total variation penalty, and (2) the inter-site structure captured via the multitask `1{`2-penalty. To solve the resulting high dimensional optimization problem, we introduce an extension to a recently proposed algorithm based on the alternating direction method. The potential utility of the proposed method is demonstrated on the multisite ADHD-200 dataset.",2014,
Synergistic drug combinations from electronic health records and gene expression,"Objective
Using electronic health records (EHRs) and biomolecular data, we sought to discover drug pairs with synergistic repurposing potential. EHRs provide real-world treatment and outcome patterns, while complementary biomolecular data, including disease-specific gene expression and drug-protein interactions, provide mechanistic understanding.


Method
We applied Group Lasso INTERaction NETwork (glinternet), an overlap group lasso penalty on a logistic regression model, with pairwise interactions to identify variables and interacting drug pairs associated with reduced 5-year mortality using EHRs of 9945 breast cancer patients. We identified differentially expressed genes from 14 case-control human breast cancer gene expression datasets and integrated them with drug-protein networks. Drugs in the network were scored according to their association with breast cancer individually or in pairs. Lastly, we determined whether synergistic drug pairs found in the EHRs were enriched among synergistic drug pairs from gene-expression data using a method similar to gene set enrichment analysis.


Results
From EHRs, we discovered 3 drug-class pairs associated with lower mortality: anti-inflammatories and hormone antagonists, anti-inflammatories and lipid modifiers, and lipid modifiers and obstructive airway drugs. The first 2 pairs were also enriched among pairs discovered using gene expression data and are supported by molecular interactions in drug-protein networks and preclinical and epidemiologic evidence.


Conclusions
This is a proof-of-concept study demonstrating that a combination of complementary data sources, such as EHRs and gene expression, can corroborate discoveries and provide mechanistic insight into drug synergism for repurposing.",2017,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA
THU0431 The Prediction and Benefits of Minimal Disease Activity in Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis in the Adept Trial,"Background Minimal disease activity (MDA)1 is a clinically meaningful and comprehensive treatment target for psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Objectives To determine if baseline (BL) disease activity and/or patient (pt) demographics predict the ability to achieve MDA at week (wk) 12 in pts with PsA, and to evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at wk 24 associated with achieving MDA. Methods Data were from the ADEPT (NCT00646386) trial of adalimumab vs placebo in pts with PsA. BL characteristics which predicted achievement of MDA at wk 12 were identified by univariate and multivariate (LASSO) analyses. Continuous variables were age, weight, modified total Sharp score (mTSS), tender/swollen joint count (T/SJC), Pt Global Assessment of disease activity (PtGA) or pain (PtGA-pain), Physician9 s Global assessment of disease activity (PhGA), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), dactylitis, enthesitis (2 sites), Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) and Physician9s Global Assessment of Psoriasis (PGAP). Categorical variables were gender, smoking (yes/no), alcohol use (yes/no), methotrexate use (yes/no), rheumatoid factor status, presence/absence of investigator-reported spondylitis, C-reactive protein levels ( Results In the univariate analysis, lower scores at BL for PtGA-pain, SJC66, TJC68, enthesitis and HAQ predicted MDA at wk 12. In the multivariate analysis, a one unit increase in BL HAQ and enthesitis score reduced the odds of achieving MDA at wk 12 by 37.6% and 16.0% respectively. The odds of achieving MDA was reduced by 22.6% for pts with spondylitis at BL compared to pts without spondylitis. At wk 24, MDA achievers (n=27) had significantly better scores (p Conclusions Absence of spondylitis and lower scores for HAQ and enthesitis at BL were found to increase the likelihood of achieving MDA at wk 12. MDA achievement at wk 24 was associated with clinically important improvement in QoL and fatigue. References Coates et al ARD, 2010; 69: 48-53.

BLP-2LASSO for aggregate discrete choice models with rich covariates,"We introduce the BLP-LASSO model, which augments the classic BLP (Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes, 1995) random-coefficients logit model to allow for data-driven selection among a highdimensional set of control variables. Economists often study consumersâ€™ aggregate behavior across markets choosing from a menu of differentiated products. In this analysis, local demographic characteristics can serve as controls for market-specific preference heterogeneity. Given rich demographic data, implementing these models requires specifying which variables to include in the analysis, an ad hoc process typically guided primarily by a researcherâ€™s intuition. We propose a data-driven approach to estimate these models applying penalized estimation algorithms imported from the machine learning literature that are known to be valid for uniform inferences with respect to variable selection. Our application explores the effect of campaign spending on vote shares in data from Mexican elections.",2019,Econometrics Journal
The Ruin of Kasch,"Taking as his focus the periods immediately before and after the French Revolution but making occasional sallies backward and forward in time - from Vedic India to the porticoes of the Palais-Royal and to the killing fields of Pol Pot - Calasso recounts, elucidates, and interprets the downfall of what Baudelaire was already calling ""the Modern."" This downfall came as a sequel to an earlier and opposite collapse: that of the archaic societies which were regulated by the movements of the stars and the rituals of sacrifice. At the center of the work stands the story of the ruin of Kasch, a legendary African kingdom whose annihilation becomes emblematic of the ruin of the ancient and modern worlds. The genius of Calasso's book is that, in its illuminating blend of literature and ideas, it establishes a genre all its own. Its form is a rich blend of anecdotes, quotations, analysis, digressions, aphorisms, dialogues, historical discussion, and straightforward storytelling that beautifully mirrors its subject matter and evokes the protean spirit of Modernism. It is a sumptuous literary feast. Calasso brings to his stage a vast gallery of characters, including Laclos and Marx, Benjamin and Chateaubriand, Sainte-Beuve and Levi-Strauss, Max Stirner and Joseph de Maistre. And presiding over them all is the French statesman Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord, who knew the secrets of both the Old and New regimes and who was able to adjust the perplexing and cruel notion of ""legitimacy"" to the modern age. Cynical Talleyrand - who showed that success in the new era depends on agility, fluidity, and a consummate sense of style - serves, fittingly, as the master of ceremonies throughout the book,which is at once a meditation on the origins and nature of power and a breathtaking synthesis of Western cultural history. It is an extraordinary reading experience.",1994,
Highly Sensitive Marker Panel for Guidance in Lung Cancer Rapid Diagnostic Units,"While evidence for lung cancer screening implementation in Europe is awaited, Rapid Diagnostic Units have been established in many hospitals to accelerate the early diagnosis of lung cancer. We seek to develop an algorithm to detect lung cancer in a symptomatic population attending such unit, based on a sensitive serum marker panel. Serum concentrations of Epidermal Growth Factor, sCD26, Calprotectin, Matrix Metalloproteinases -1, -7, -9, CEA and CYFRA 21.1 were determined in 140 patients with respiratory symptoms (lung cancer and controls with/without benign pathology). Logistic Lasso regression was performed to derive a lung cancer prediction model, and the resulting algorithm was tested in a validation set. A classification rule based on EGF, sCD26, Calprotectin and CEA was established, able to reasonably discriminate lung cancer with 97% sensitivity and 43% specificity in the training set, and 91.7% sensitivity and 45.4% specificity in the validation set. Overall, the panel identified with high sensitivity stage I non-small cell lung cancer (94.7%) and 100% small-cell lung cancers.

Generic Error Bounds for the Generalized Lasso with Sub-Exponential Data,"This work performs a non-asymptotic analysis of the (constrained) generalized Lasso under the assumption of sub-exponential data. Our main results continue recent research on the benchmark case of sub-Gaussian sample distributions and thereby explore what conclusions are still valid when going beyond. While many statistical features of the generalized Lasso remain unaffected (e.g., consistency), the key difference becomes manifested in the way how the complexity of the hypothesis set is measured. It turns out that the estimation error can be controlled by means of two complexity parameters that arise naturally from a generic-chaining-based proof strategy. The only requirement for the input vector is a generic concentration inequality of Bernstein-type, which can be implemented for a variety of sub-exponential distributions. This abstract approach allows us to reproduce, unify, and extend previously known guarantees for the generalized Lasso. In particular, we present applications to semi-parametric output models and phase retrieval via the lifted Lasso. Moreover, our findings are discussed in the context of sparse recovery and high-dimensional estimation problems.",2020,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Determining Unintelligible Words from their Textual Contexts,"Abstract We propose a method to determine unintelligible words based on the textual context of the word determined. As there can be many different possibilities for the word, a robust, large-scale method is needed. The large scale makes the problem sensitive to spurious similarities of contexts: when the contexts of two, different words are similar. To reduce this effect, we induce structured sparsity on the words by formulating the task as a group Lasso problem. We compare this formulation to a k-nearest neighbor and a support vector machine based approach, and find that group Lasso outperforms both by a large margin. We achieve up to 75% of accuracy when determining the word from among 1000 words both on the Brown corpus and on the British National Corpus. Unintelligible words are often the result of errors in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms. As the proposed method utilizes information independent from information used in OCR, we expect that a combined approach could be very successful, as OCR and the proposed method complement each other.",2013,Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences
Percutaneous pulmonary vein electric isolation using catheter cryoablation in the treatment of atrial fibrillation,"Objectives To investigate the efficacy of percutaneous pulmonary vein electric isolation using catheter cryoablation in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.Methods We respectively analyed the clinical data of 15 patients with atrial fibrillation who performed percutaneous pulmonary vein electric isolation using catheter cryoablation,focused on the preparation,methods,results,complication and follow-up of the therapy.Results Cryoablation was carryed out with the Arctic Circler cryoablation catheter in the debouch of pulmonary vein under the guidance of Lasso mapping electrode.Among the 13 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,10 of them maintained sinus rhythm and 3 of them had temporary atrial fibrillation during the operation,and the 3 patients automaticly stopped atrial fibrillation.One of the permanent atrial fibrillation patients could stop atrial fibrillation during the therapy of catheter cryoablation,the other failed to stop atrial brillation and changed to sinus rhythm by direct current countershock after operation.The achievement ratio of catheter cryoablation was 93.3%(14 /15).Cryoablation was performed in totally 54 pulmonary veins in 15 cases with atrial fibrillation.Thirty-six pulmonary veins were successfully isolated with the single use of the circular cryoablation catheter after 4-6 cryoablation,while additional radiofrequency ablations needed to be applied at gaps on the circular cryoablation lines to achieve completely isolation in 18 pulmonary veins.Serious complications,such as acute pulmonary vein stenosis,thromboembolism and cardiac perforation did not happen during operation and after operation.After a follow-up of 6-10 months,11 patients improved clinically and remained atrial fibrillation free.Four of them required antiarrhythmic medications to maintain sinus.Four patients had recurrence of atrial fibrillation.Selective pulmonary venography immediately after ablation and repeat magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) scan at 6 months didn't show any stenosis of the treated veins.Conclusions Transcatheter cryoablation is both safe and effective,and may be considered as a primary treatment procedure for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.",2009,South China Journal of Cardiovascular Diseases
Audio declipping with social sparsity,"We consider the audio declipping problem by using iterative thresholding algorithms and the principle of social sparsity. This recently introduced approach features thresholding/shrinkage operators which allow to model dependencies between neighboring coefficients in expansions with time-frequency dictionaries. A new unconstrained convex formulation of the audio declipping problem is introduced. The chosen structured thresholding operators are the so called windowed group-Lasso and the persistent empirical Wiener. The usage of these operators significantly improves the quality of the reconstruction, compared to simple soft-thresholding. The resulting algorithm is fast, simple to implement, and it outperforms the state of the art in terms of signal to noise ratio.",2014,"2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Texture analysis on gadoxetic acid enhanced-MRI for predicting Ki-67 status in hepatocellular carcinoma: A prospective study,"Objective
To investigate the value of whole-lesion texture analysis on preoperative gadoxetic acid enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting tumor Ki-67 status after curative resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).


Methods
This study consisted of 89 consecutive patients with surgically confirmed HCC. Texture features were extracted from multiparametric MRI based on whole-lesion regions of interest. The Ki-67 status was immunohistochemical determined and classified into low Ki-67 (labeling index â‰¤15%) and high Ki-67 (labeling index >15%) groups. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic regression were applied for generating the texture signature, clinical nomogram and combined nomogram. The discrimination power, calibration and clinical usefulness of the three models were evaluated accordingly. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates after curative hepatectomy were also compared between groups.


Results
A total of 13 texture features were selected to construct a texture signature for predicting Ki-67 status in HCC patients (C-index: 0.878, 95% confidence interval: 0.791-0.937). After incorporating texture signature to the clinical nomogram which included significant clinical variates (AFP, BCLC-stage, capsule integrity, tumor margin, enhancing capsule), the combined nomogram showed higher discrimination ability (C-index: 0.936vs. 0.795, P<0.001), good calibration (P>0.05 in Hosmer-Lemeshow test) and higher clinical usefulness by decision curve analysis. RFS rate was significantly lower in the high Ki-67 group compared with the low Ki-67 group after curative surgery (63.27%vs. 85.00%, P<0.05).


Conclusions
Texture analysis on gadoxetic acid enhanced MRI can serve as a noninvasive approach to preoperatively predict Ki-67 status of HCC after curative resection. The combination of texture signature and clinical factors demonstrated the potential to further improve the prediction performance.",2019,Chinese Journal of Cancer Research
Some Methods Of Quantile Regression For Analysis Of The Poverty In Iraq,"World Bank has mentioned that approximately half of the worldâ€™s poor people live in countries with high income and many of these countries are oil producer countries. In this paper we study some of the economic variables (unemployment, average monthly per capita income, average monthly per capita spending on basic food, the rise in prices of these basic food goods and average taxes imposed on the Iraqi citizen) that impact on the increasing number of poor households in Iraq. We employ a regression model based on classical quantile regression for building the models which represent the relationship between the response variable and the covariates, through five quantile lines (0.16, 0.33, 0.50, 0.66, 0.83). We also use Bayes Lasso quantile regression for variable selection. The data were taken from an economic survey made by the Central Bureau of Statistics in 2007.

InBayesian framework, quantities ofinterest are described byprobabilities andoptimal decisions canbemade byreasoning aboutthese probabilities together withthe observation orevidence. Bayesian reasoning isimportant to machine learning because itprovides aquantitative approach toweighting theevidence supporting alternative hypotheses. Numerousalgorithms havebeenproposed forlearning the Bayesian network structure andparameter fromobserved data. Thesealgorithms produce a single Bayesian model bymaximizing itsprobability given thetraining data, i.e. maximumaposterior approximation. Inrealistic problem, learning Bayesian modelbytrain- ingdatarequires relative large amountofobserved data comparing tothesize ofnetwork. However, thedatabasis isoften verysparse anditishardly sufficient toselect oneadequate modelduetothemodeluncertainty, thus, selecting asingle modelmayinduce overfitting tothedata andcanleadtostrongly biased inference results.

Oil spills: microorganisms to the rescue?,"bacteria constitute a natural mechanism for cleaning up oil in the environment. Every year, 1,300,000 tonnes of oil enter the environÂ­ ment, for the most part through natural petroleum seeps. The fact that beaches are not perpetually covÂ­ ered with tar balls is due to the activity of microÂ­ organisms that can degrade the released petroleum. These include species of the genera Alcanivorax, Cycloclasticus and Thalassolituus, which can degrade various branchedÂ­chain and straightÂ­chain saturated hydrocarbons and even polycyclic aromatic hydrocarÂ­ bons; in fact, for some species hydrocarbons are the sole carbon source1. Oil release from petroleum seeps is slow, allowing the local microbial communities to degrade the oil as it enters their environment. Thus, bacteria constitute a natural mechanism for cleaning up oil in the environment. However, during manÂ­ made oil spills, such as the current spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the amount of oil can overwhelm the natural microbial community, allowing the oil to spread and wash up onshore, leading to substantial environmental and ecological problems. Can the natural ability of microorganisms to degrade oil be harnessed to clean up oil spills? In the open ocean, there is often not much that can be done, owing to the sheer size of the affected area. However, there are two approaches that can be used when oil washes onshore: introduction of bacteria that degrade oil (known as seeding) and fertilization to increase the growth of the natural microbial flora. Seeding, with either natural isolates or, potentially, new and engiÂ­ neered bacteria, has shown promise in laboratory tests, but field trials have shown mixed results at best, and in several cases no benefit was observed. Oil spills lead to rapid changes in the composition of the natural bacteÂ­ rial flora; oilÂ­degrading bacteria that are nearly undeÂ­ tectable before release of the oil can become dominant in its presence. Thus, the introduced bacteria are likely to add little to the natural flora. Indeed, in the Gulf of Mexico the reduced oxygen levels around the oil in open water indicate bacterial proliferation in response to the presence of oil. Although these changes seem to be slow from our human perspective, ecologically they are rapid changes that show that the natural response is efficient, especially in open waters. However, fertilization of the natural flora has proved more successful, although the increased rate of oil removal seen with this approach is still measÂ­ ured in days, weeks and even months; bacteria do not provide a â€˜quick fixâ€™ that rapidly scrubs the beaches clean. In an oilÂ­rich environment, the limiting nutriÂ­ ents for bacterial growth are nitrogen and, to a lesser extent, phosphorus. Fertilizers containing nitrogen and phosphorus therefore stimulate bacterial growth and increase the rate of oil removal. One of the first trials of this approach, in 1976, showed that addition of fertilizers can increase the rate but not the extent of oil degradation. Trials in Prince William Sound in Alaska, USA, after the Exxon Valdez spill have shown that this method is effective in practice. It is perhaps disappointing that microbiological approaches for oil removal have not improved much since the clean up of the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, despite our vastly greater understanding of the microÂ­ biology of oil degradation and of the manipulation of bacterial metabolic pathways. This may reflect the difficulty in improving an already rather efficient sysÂ­ tem but, as Jan van der Meer, one of the coordinators of the Bacterial Abiotic Cellular Stress and Survival Improvement Network (BACSIN) states, â€œwe are obviously a bit frustrated that we do not have 5,000 tons or so of specifically formulated active Alcanivorax borkumensis in stock to bring out in the Gulf of Mexicoâ€. It is encouraging that the US National Science Foundation has announced the availability of rapidÂ­ response grants to look at the natural response to the oil spill and has already awarded grants to study the shortÂ­term and longÂ­term effects of the spill on microÂ­ organisms. More inÂ­depth knowledge of the microbial response will undoubtedly allow more applications of microbial oil degradation for cleanÂ­up during future spills. But this requires that funding agencies become and remain committed to funding for research into bioremediation as well as oil breakdown and its applications.",2010,Nature Reviews Microbiology
Forward LASSOanalysis for high-order interactions in genome-wide association study,"Previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) focused on low-order interactions between pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with significant main effects. Little is known how high-order interactions effect, especially one among the SNPs without main effects regulates quantitative traits.Within the frameworks of linear model and generalized linear model, the LASSO with coordinate descent step can be used to simultaneously analyze thousands and thousands of SNPs for normal and discrete traits. With consideration of high-order interactions among SNPs, a huge number of genetic effects make the LASSO failing to work under the presented condition of computation. Forward LASSO analysis is, therefore, proposed to shrink most of genetic effects to be zeros stage by stage. Simulation demonstrates that our proposed method could be used instead of the LASSO method for full model in mapping high-order interactions. Application of forward LASSO method is provided to GWAS for carcass traits and meat quality traits in beef cattle.",2014,

Recurrenceâ€associated gene signature optimizes recurrenceâ€free survival prediction of colorectal cancer,"High throughput gene expression profiling has showed great promise in providing insight into molecular mechanisms. Metastasis-related mRNAs may potentially enrich genes with the ability to predict cancer recurrence, therefore we attempted to build a recurrence-associated gene signature to improve prognostic prediction of colorectal cancer (CRC). We identified 2848 differentially expressed mRNAs by analyzing CRC tissues with or without metastasis. For the selection of prognostic genes, a LASSO Cox regression model (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method) was employed. Using this method, a 13-mRNA signature was identified and then validated in two independent Gene Expression Omnibus cohorts. This classifier could successfully discriminate the high-risk patients in discovery cohort [hazard ratio (HR)Â =Â 5.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.30-12.08, PÂ <Â 0.0001). Analysis in two independent cohorts yielded consistent results (GSE14333: HRÂ =Â 4.55, 95%Â CI 2.18-9.508, PÂ <Â 0.0001; GSE33113: HRÂ =Â 3.26, 95% CI 2.16-9.16, PÂ =Â 0.0176). Further analysis revealed that the prognostic value of this signature was independent of tumor stage, postoperative chemotherapy and somatic mutation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the area under ROC curve of this signature was 0.8861 and 0.8157 in the discovery and validation cohort, respectively. A nomogram was constructed for clinicians, and did well in the calibration plots. Furthermore, this 13-mRNA signature outperformed other known gene signatures, including oncotypeDX colon cancer assay. Single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis revealed that a group of pathways related to drug resistance, cancer metastasis and stemness were significantly enriched in the high-risk patients. In conclusion, this 13-mRNA signature may be a useful tool for prognostic evaluation and will facilitate personalized management of CRC patients.",2017,Molecular Oncology
A New Multiple Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Based Predictive Model for Grades III to IV and Extensive Graft Versus Host Disease after Identical HLA-Allogeneic Stem-Cell,"![Graphic][1] 

Introduction

Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the main cause of morbi-mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Despite considerable advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology, nowdays anticipation of GVHD is an unresolved matter. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes have shown to be associated with donor-recipient alloreactivity and, ultimately, with SCT outcome. In the present study, we propose a novel predictive model based on both clinical and genetic (SNP) variables applying an innovative estimation linear regression model, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), in a large cohort of HLA-identical sibling donor allo-SCT.

Patients and Methods

The study evaluated 25 SNPs in 12 genes (Table 1) in genomic DNA obtained from PB samples from 273 patients with available acute GVHD (aGVHD) data and 213 patients with chronic GVHD (cGVHD) data included in the DNA Bank of the Spanish Group for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (GETH) and their HLA-identical sibling donors. Each SNP was assessed for different models of transmission (recessive, dominant, co-dominant and additive), producing 25 SNPs x 4 models = 100 variables. Clinical variables known to influence the development of GVHD were also considered (Table 1). Univariate regression analysis was performed using Cox regression (data not shown). Multivariant analysis was made with LASSO, an innovative estimation method for linear regression models which is able to select a set of optimal predictors from a large set of potential predictor variables and was considered as a variables selection method under the estimation of a Logit regression model. In this model, the strength of the penalty term is controlled by a smoothing parameter (Î»), which is chosen by maximizing the area under ROC curve (AUC) and the correct classification rate (CCR). The statistical model was fitted (goodness-of-fit assessment) by randomly selecting the 85% of the data (the so-called ""training set""), and the predictive ability was computed with the remaining 15% (the so-called ""testing set""). In order to evaluate the performance and the prediction ability of each model, training and testing samples were randomly selected a total of 100 times. The distribution of the CCR and the AUC over the 100 samplings, were shown by means of box plots and statistical summary in the results data. Finally, for prediction purposes, we considered a cut-off value according to the proportion of Y=1 in the sample (0.28 for grades II-IV aGVHD, 0.11 for grades III-IV aGVHD and 0.30 for extensive cGVHD).

Results

The best model to predict aGVHD II-IV included 11 genetic variables and no clinical variables with a CCR for patients who developed (CCR1) aGVHD II-IV of 63.6% (Figure 2). The best model to predict aGVHD III-IV included 20 genetic and 7 clinical variables with a CCR1 for aGVHD III-IV of 100%. The best model to predict extensive chronic GVHD included 10 genetic and 3 clinical variables with a CCR1 for extensive cGVHD of 80%. On the other hand, predictive models with only clinical variables showed a poorer CCR1 for patients who developed aGVHD II-IV, aGVHD III-IV and extensive cGVHD (55.6%, 50% and 66.7% respectively; Figure 1). Based on the results from LASSO multivariate analyses, a risk score was calculated for grades II-IV and III-IV aGVHD as well as for cGVHD and extensive cGVHD. Patients were categorized into two groups: low risk (below the cut-off value) and high risk (above the cut-off). Such risk model was able to stratify patients who develop grades II-IV aGVHD (p<0.001), grades III-IV aGVHD (p<0.001) and extensive cGVHD (p<0.001) more consistently than models only considering clinical variables (Figure 2).

Conclusions

Identification of biomarkers useful for the estimation of the risk of GVHD constitutes an unmet need in the clinical management of GVHD. The novel predictive model proposed here, based on clinical and genetic factors, allows significantly improved anticipation of aGVHD III-IV (100% accuracy) and extensive cGVHD (80%) after HLA-identical sibling donor allo-SCT. This approach would allow a personalized risk-adapted clinical management of patients after transplantation.

Validation of an Electronic Medical Record-Based Algorithm for Identifying Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in U.S. Veterans.,"We developed an algorithm for identifying U.S. veterans with a history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), using the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic medical record (EMR) system. This work was motivated by the need to create a valid EMR-based phenotype to identify thousands of cases and controls for a genome-wide association study of PTSD in veterans. We used manual chart review (n = 500) as the gold standard. For both the algorithm and chart review, three classifications were possible: likely PTSD, possible PTSD, and likely not PTSD. We used Lasso regression with cross-validation to select statistically significant predictors of PTSD from the EMR and then generate a predicted probability score of being a PTSD case for every participant in the study population (range: 0-1.00). Comparing the performance of our probabilistic approach (Lasso algorithm) to a rule-based approach (International Classification of Diseases [ICD] algorithm), the Lasso algorithm showed modestly higher overall percent agreement with chart review than the ICD algorithm (80% vs. 75%), higher sensitivity (0.95 vs. 0.84), and higher accuracy (AUC = 0.95 vs. 0.90). We applied a 0.7 probability cut-point to the Lasso results to determine final PTSD case-control status for the VA population. The final algorithm had a 0.99 sensitivity, 0.99 specificity, 0.95 positive predictive value, and 1.00 negative predictive value for PTSD classification (grouping possible PTSD and likely not PTSD) as determined by chart review. This algorithm may be useful for other research and quality improvement endeavors within the VA.",2019,Journal of traumatic stress
Optimal Regularization in Distribution of Relaxation Times applied to Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy: Ridge and Lasso Regression Methods - A Theoretical and Experimental Study,"The Distribution of Relaxation Times (DRT) is an approach of particular interest to the interpretation of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The DRT allows direct access to the time characteristics of the electrochemical system under study. Obtaining the DRT from noisy EIS data requires solving an ill-posed problem using regularization methods. In this work we investigate the optimal choice of the regularization parameter in the case of ridge regression. For this purpose we propose two novel sets of test functions known as real and imaginary discrepancy test function, and real and imaginary cross-validation test functions. Furthermore, we show the validity of these tests with synthetic and real experiments. By applying the optimal regularization parameters, the DRT results from the synthetic experiments (an RC circuit, a ZARC, and a fractal element) successfully reproduce the known exact DRT. Additionally, in the cases taken from electrochemical practice (a collection of RC circuits, a symmetric cell, and a commercial Li-ion battery) our approach confirms the ability to identify various timescales. Additionally, we study the output of the regularization using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) and we highlight the added value given by the synergetic use of Lasso and ridge regression.",2014,Electrochimica Acta
Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency in germinating seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris L. exposed to soaking injury,"Exogenous application of thiamine (vitamin B1) during imbibition improved germination and seedling development of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Lasso) seeds, which were exposed to soaking injury by submergence. Leaching of the vitamin into the incubation medium was not increased in submerged seeds. However, translocation of the thiamine reserves from the cotyledons to the seedling axis was reduced in response to soaking injury. After exogenous application of free thiamine to the seeds, thiaminedi-phosphate (TDP), which is the physiologically active coenzyme form of thiamine, accumulated in the seedling axis of submerged seeds, suggesting an increased demand for thiamine-dependent metabolic reactions in these tissues. Limited oxygen supply of the seeds during the soaking period induces a shift from respiration to fermentation of carbohydrates. Neither thiamine-dependent ethanolic fermentation, nor ATP production or adenylate energy charge (AEC) of the seedling axis were affected by exogenous thiamine application, suggesting that there is no limitation of thiamine-dependent reactions in the energy metabolism of the seedlings. Thus the physiological mechanisms improving germination and seedling development of submerged seeds in response to thiamine seed treatment are still not clear.",1999,Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science
Regression for Analysis of Genomic Data,"We consider estimation and variable selection in high-dimensional Cox regression when a prior knowledge of the relationships among the covariates, de- scribed by a network or graph, is available. A limitation of the existing methodology for survival analysis with high-dimensional genomic data is that a wealth of struc- tural information about many biological processes, such as regulatory networks and pathways, has often been ignored. In order to incorporate such prior network information into the analysis of genomic data, we propose a network-based regu- larization method for high-dimensional Cox regression, by using an '1-penalty to induce sparsity of the regression coecients and a quadratic Laplacian penalty to encourage smoothness between the coecients of neighboring variables on a given network. The proposed method is implemented by an ecient coordinate descent algorithm. In the setting where the dimensionality p may grow exponentially fast with the sample size n, we establish model selection consistency and estimation bounds for the proposed estimators. The theoretical results provide insights into the gain from taking into account the network structural information. Extensive simulation studies indicate that our method outperforms Lasso and elastic net in terms of variable selection accuracy and stability. We apply our method to a breast cancer gene expression study and identify several biologically plausible subnetworks and pathways that are associated with breast cancer distant metastasis.",2013,
A predictive model for diagnosing stroke-related apraxia of speech,"Diagnosis of the speech motor planning/programming disorder, apraxia of speech (AOS), has proven challenging, largely due to its common co-occurrence with the language-based impairment of aphasia. Currently, diagnosis is based on perceptually identifying and rating the severity of several speech features. It is not known whether all, or a subset of the features, are required for a positive diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to assess predictor variables for the presence of AOS after left-hemisphere stroke, with the goal of increasing diagnostic objectivity and efficiency. This population-based case-control study involved a sample of 72 cases, using the outcome measure of expert judgment on presence of AOS and including a large number of independently collected candidate predictors representing behavioral measures of linguistic, cognitive, nonspeech oral motor, and speech motor ability. We constructed a predictive model using multiple imputation to deal with missing data; the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) technique for variable selection to define the most relevant predictors, and bootstrapping to check the model stability and quantify the optimism of the developed model. Two measures were sufficient to distinguish between participants with AOS plus aphasia and those with aphasia alone, (1) a measure of speech errors with words of increasing length and (2) a measure of relative vowel duration in three-syllable words with weak-strong stress pattern (e.g., banana, potato). The model has high discriminative ability to distinguish between cases with and without AOS (c-index=0.93) and good agreement between observed and predicted probabilities (calibration slope=0.94). Some caution is warranted, given the relatively small sample specific to left-hemisphere stroke, and the limitations of imputing missing data. These two speech measures are straightforward to collect and analyse, facilitating use in research and clinical settings.",2016,Neuropsychologia
Orlando di Lasso's psalm settings : an examination of genre in late sixteenth-century psalm motets and German Leider,"Diane S. Temme, Orlando di Lassoâ€™s Psalm Settings: An Examination of Genre in Psalm Motets and German Lieder, Ph.D. Dissertation: Bangor University, December 2017. Supervisor: Christian Leitmeir. Lasso was considered the greatest composer of his generation with undisputable mastery of all sixteenth-century genres. The dynamism of the late sixteenth century saw the most sophisticated compositions in the continuation of the psalm motet tradition. However, more flexible applications for the psalms in the form of meditations, vernacular translations, and paraphrases opened the door for new and diverse interpretations. This dissertation is a study of Lassoâ€™s engagement with established musical traditions and new trends in psalmody. This study unfolds in two parts. First in the discussion of the Latin psalm motet genre and then ensuing with investigation of the German Lied. In each of the genres (1) there is a focus on the definition and classification of terms and older traditions, (2) the examination of the text and the discussion of ways in which the music engages with the prose and poetic forms, and (3) the evaluation of Lassoâ€™s interpretation of psalm texts. From negligible German Lieder to expansive motet cycles, the psalms afforded endless polyphonic inspiration and the diversity of which categorically points to the shifts and development of cultural and aesthetic traditions. The use of psalms to reflect devotion and confession amplifies the Catholic Reform implemented at the Bavarian court during Lassoâ€™s lifetime. This context along with Lassoâ€™s compositional innovation provides an interesting study for the stylistic development of psalm settings in the late sixteenth century.

"Disease, Resistance, and Lies: The Demise of the Transatlantic Slave Trade to Brazil and Cuba by Dale T. Graden (review)","blacks for social recognition and citizenship (including the long-delayed right to vote. McGraw examines the whitesâ€™ contempt for the Caribbean blacksâ€™ population via their frustration with, and anger about, the lack of discipline of the bogasâ€”black males who painfully propelled their boats up the Magdalena River with poles. He suggests that white elites in Colombiaâ€™s interior welcomed the introduction of steamboats on the river because it lessened the necessity of relying on the bogas. Steamboats could go upriver in eight or nine days compared to the more than a month that the poled boats took. Also examined are the cases of two Caribbean blacks who became educated: Candelario Obeso became a writer; his literary status among the white literati appears to have been at best ambiguous. Luis A. Robles, who became governor of the State of Magdalena, appears to have been an unmitigated success. In treating Colombiaâ€™s â€œRegenerationâ€ years (1884â€“1898), McGraw undoubtedly is correct in emphasizing the damaging effect of extreme monetary inflation on the black population of the Caribbean. Other poor people in Colombia must have been similarly affected. The role of blacks who fought for the defeated Liberal rebels in the War of a Thousand Days that followed the Regeneration years (1899â€“1902) was compromised by the inability of Liberal elite leaders to communicate effectively with the black rank and file in the Caribbean zone. This book is based on deep and original research and explores in considerable depth social themes not previously treated in the literature. Other scholars, notably Helg and Lasso, have also dealt with the social or political status of black populations in Colombiaâ€™s Caribbean zone but in earlier periods. McGrawâ€™s literary analysis of Obesoâ€™s work is as close as the book gets to interdisciplinary work.",2015,Journal of Interdisciplinary History
Neutrophils releasing IL-17A into NETs are essential to plasma cell differentiation in inflamed tissue dependent on IL-1R.,"Interleukin (IL) 17A in chronic inflammation is also produced by innate immune cells as neutrophils. Mice with chronic humoral response induced by venom of Thalassophryne nattereri (VTn) proved to be a good tool for evaluating the impact of IL-17A on the development of long-lived plasma cells in the inflamed peritoneal cavity. Here, we report that VTn induces IL-17A production by neutrophils accumulating in the peritoneal cavity and triggers the extrusion of IL-17A along with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Neutrophil depletion reduced the number of IL17A-producing cells in VTn-immunized mice and blocked the differentiation of long-lived plasma cells. Specific antibody production and survival of long-lived plasma cells was ablated in VTn-immunized mice deficient in CD4, while CD28 signaling had the opposite effect on differentiation of long-lived plasma cells. Further, maturation of long-lived plasma cells in inflamed peritoneal cavity was IL-1R1 and COX-2 dependent. Finally, when both the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway and the IL-17A or IL-1R1 activities were blocked, neutrophils were unable to promote the differentiation of memory B cells into long-lived plasma cells, confirming the essential role of neutrophils and IL-17A along with NETs in an IL-1/IL-1R-dependent manner as the novel helping partner for plasma cell differentiation in chronically inflamed tissues.",2017,Autoimmunity
Polar record of Early Jurassic massive carbon injection,"The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE) (ca. 182 Myr, EarlyJurassic) represents one of the best-recognized examples of greenhouse warming, decreased seawater oxygenation and mass extinction. The leading hypothesis to explain these changes is the massive injection of thermogenic or gas hydrate-derived 13C-depleted carbon into the atmosphere, resulting in a > 3 per mil negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE), accelerated nutrient input and dissolved oxygen consumption in the oceans. Nevertheless, the lack of a precisely dated record of the T-OAE outside low latitudes has led to considerable debate about both its temporal and spatial extent and hence concerning its underlying causes. Here we present new isotopic and lithological data from three precisely dated N Siberian sections, which demonstrate that mass extinction and onset of strong oxygen-deficiency occurred near synchronously in polar and most tropical sites and were intimately linked to the onset of a marked 6â€° negative CIE recorded by bulk organic carbon. Rock Eval pyrolysis data from Siberia and comparisons with low latitudes show that the CIE cannot be explained by the extent of stratification of the studied basins or changes in organic matter sourcing and suggest that the negative CIE reflects rapid 13C-depleted carbon injection to all exchangeable reservoirs. Sedimentological and palynological indicators show that the injection coincided with a change from cold (abundant glendonites and exotic boulder-sized clasts) to exceptionally warm conditions (dominance of the thermophyllic pollen genus Classopollis) in the Arctic, which likely triggered a rapid, possibly partly glacioeustatic sea-level rise. Comparisons with low latitude records reveal that warm climate conditions and poor marine oxygenation persisted in continental margins at least 600 kyr after the CIE, features that can be attributed to protracted and massive volcanic carbon dioxide degassing. Our data reveal that the T-OAE profoundly affected Arctic climate and oceanography and suggest that the CIE was a consequence of global and massive 13C-depleted carbon injection.",2011,Earth and Planetary Science Letters
A classification model for predicting diabetic retinopathy based on patient characteristics and biochemical measures,"Purpose: In the United Kingdom (UK), The NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Program offers an annual eye examination to all people with diabetes aged 12 or over, aiming at the early detection of people at high risk of visual loss due to diabetic retinopathy. The purpose of this study was the design of a model to predict patients at risk of developing retinopathy with the use of patient characteristics and clinical measures.Â  Methods: We investigated data from 2011 to 2016 from the population-based Diabetic Eye Screening Program in East Anglia. The data comprised retinal eye screening results, patient characteristics, and routine biochemical measures of HbA1c, blood pressure, Albumin to Creatinine ratio (ACR), estimated Glomerular Filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, cholesterol and Body Mass Index (BMI). Individuals were classified according to the presence or absence of retinopathy as indicated by their retinal eye examinations. A lasso regression, random forest, gradient boosting machine and regularized gradient boosting model were built and cross-validated for their predictive ability.Â  Results: A total of 6,375 subjects with recorded information for all available biochemical measures were identified from the cohorts. Of these, 5,969 individuals had no signs of diabetic retinopathy. Of the remainder 406 individuals with signs of diabetic retinopathy, 352 had background diabetic retinopathy and 54 had referable diabetic retinopathy. The highest value of the10-fold cross-validated Area under the Curve (AUC) was achieved by the gradient boosting machine 0.73 Â± 0.03 and the minimum required set of variables to yield this performance included 4 variables: duration of diabetes, HbA1c, ACR and age. A subsequent analysis on the predictive power of the biochemical measures showed that when HbA1c and ACR measurements were available for longer time periods, the performance of the models was greatly enhanced. When HbA1c and ACR measurements for a 5-year period prior to the event of study were available, gradient boosting machine cross-validated AUC was 0.77 Â± 0.04 in comparison to the cross-validated AUC of 0.68 Â± 0.04 when only information for the 1-year period for these variables was available. Similarly, an increment from 0.70 Â± 0.02 to 0.75 Â± 0.04 was observed with random forest. The dataset with the 1-year measurements comprised 4,857 subjects, of whom, 4,572 had no retinopathy and the remainder 285 had signs of retinopathy. The dataset with the 5-year measurements comprised 757 subjects, of whom, 696 had no retinopathy and the remainder 51 had signs of retinopathy.Â  Conclusions: The utilization of patient information and routine biochemical measures can be used to identify patients at risk of developing retinopathy. The effective differentiation between patients with and without retinopathy could significantly reduce the number of screening visits without compromising patientsâ€™ health.",2017,
Pd13-12â€ƒtof-ms Based Urine Dna Methylation Classifier: a Fast and Effective Technique for Non-invasive Diagnosis and Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The gold standard method used to detect and monitor bladder cancer is cystoscopy, which leads to high diagnostic costs and a high patient burden. The currently available non-invasive approaches either show unsatisfying sensitivity in low-grade tumors or possess limited specificity. This study aimed to develop a new non-invasive strategy based on urine methylation biomarker to diagnose bladder cancer effectively. METHODS: To identify the bladder cancer specific markers, genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on 21 paired bladder tumors and normal tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, and 20 paired bladder tumors and normal tissues from Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital (SYMH) cohort. Next, Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (TOF-MS) analysis was performed to access markers efficiency in large cohort. We enrolled 423 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer, 82 healthy participants and 276 controls with benign diseases from SYMH cohort. DNA of 781 urine samples extracted from the urinary cells and bisulfite modificated, and methylation status was analyzed using TOF-MS. In training set, 314 urine samples were used to develop a gene classifier by LASSO regression. An additional 467 urine samples were analyzed using the 5-gene classifier for independent validation. RESULTS: We firstly identified 40 significant methylation markers in a combined analysis of TCGA cohort and SYMH cohort. 28 of 40 markers showed good concordance (87.0%) in the assessments of patient tumor tissues and urine. The TOF-MS based methylation classifier yield a good AUC of 0.915 (with a sensitivity of 89.3% and a specificity of 83.6%) in the training group. The validation group also showed an AUC of 0.903, with a sensitivity of 88.1% and a specificity of 82.4%. The methylation classifier also exhibited a significantly improved sensitivity compared to voided urine cytology and FISH. In addition, this approach could analyze 128 samples in max one time and provide clinical report less than 2 days, which facilitated doctor make decision on time. CONCLUSIONS: TOF-MS based urine DNA methylation classifier showed high accuracy and strong diagnostic power, even in early-stage/low-grade tumor patients. Therefore, it may be used as a non-invasive fast and high-through approach for diagnosis and recurrence surveillance in bladder cancer prior to the use of cystoscopy, which would greatly reduce the burden on patients.

A universal deep learning approach for modeling the flow of patients under different severities,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
The Accident and Emergency Department (A&ED) is the frontline for providing emergency care in hospitals. Unfortunately, relative A&ED resources have failed to keep up with continuously increasing demand in recent years, which leads to overcrowding in A&ED. Knowing the fluctuation of patient arrival volume in advance is a significant premise to relieve this pressure. Based on this motivation, the objective of this study is to explore an integrated framework with high accuracy for predicting A&ED patient flow under different triage levels, by combining a novel feature selection process with deep neural networks.


METHODS
Administrative data is collected from an actual A&ED and categorized into five groups based on different triage levels. A genetic algorithm (GA)-based feature selection algorithm is improved and implemented as a pre-processing step for this time-series prediction problem, in order to explore key features affecting patient flow. In our improved GA, a fitness-based crossover is proposed to maintain the joint information of multiple features during iterative process, instead of traditional point-based crossover. Deep neural networks (DNN) is employed as the prediction model to utilize their universal adaptability and high flexibility. In the model-training process, the learning algorithm is well-configured based on a parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Two effective regularization strategies are integrated in one DNN framework to avoid overfitting. All introduced hyper-parameters are optimized efficiently by grid-search in one pass.


RESULTS
As for feature selection, our improved GA-based feature selection algorithm has outperformed a typical GA and four state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms (mRMR, SAFS, VIFR, and CFR). As for the prediction accuracy of proposed integrated framework, compared with other frequently used statistical models (GLM, seasonal-ARIMA, ARIMAX, and ANN) and modern machine models (SVM-RBF, SVM-linear, RF, and R-LASSO), the proposed integrated ""DNN-I-GA"" framework achieves higher prediction accuracy on both MAPE and RMSE metrics in pairwise comparisons.


CONCLUSIONS
The contribution of our study is two-fold. Theoretically, the traditional GA-based feature selection process is improved to have less hyper-parameters and higher efficiency, and the joint information of multiple features is maintained by fitness-based crossover operator. The universal property of DNN is further enhanced by merging different regularization strategies. Practically, features selected by our improved GA can be used to acquire an underlying relationship between patient flows and input features. Predictive values are significant indicators of patients' demand and can be used by A&ED managers to make resource planning and allocation. High accuracy achieved by the present framework in different cases enhances the reliability of downstream decision makings.",2018,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine
Sequence homology between Moloney murine sarcoma virus and Moloney leukemia virus RNA.,"The Moloney murine sarcoma-leukemia virus [M-MSV (MuLV)], propagated at high multiplicity of infection (MOI), was demonstrated previously to contain a native genome mass of 4 X 10(6) daltons as contrasted to a mass of 7 X 10(6) daltons for Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV). The 4 X 10(6)-dalton classof RNA from M-MSV (MuLV) was examined for base sequence homology with DNA complementary to the 7 X 10(6)-dalton M-MuLV RNA genome. Approximately 86% of the M-MSV (MuLV) was protected from RNase digestion by hybridization, whereas 95% of M-MuLV was protected under identical conditions. These results indicate that the small RNA class of high-MOI M-MSV (MuLV) contains little (perhaps 10%) genetic information not present in M-MuLV. Virtually all of the 1.8 X 10(6)-dalton subunits of M-MSV (MuLV) RNA contained regions of poly(A) since 94% of the RNA bound to oligo(dT) cellulose in 0.5 M KCl. This suggests that the formation of the 1.8 X 10(6)-dalton subunits occurs before their packaging into virions and does not result from hydrolysis of intact 3.5 X 10(6)-dalton subunits by a virion-associated nuclease.",1976,Journal of virology

Agroforestry Adoption By Smallholders,"Agroforestry is a joint forest production system whereby land, labor, and capital inputs are combined to produce trees and agricultural crops (and/or livestock) on the same unit of land. Although existing for centuries (maybe millennia) as an array of traditional land use practices in the tropics, agroforestry emerged in the late 1970s as a modern, improved tropical land use system suitable for scientific study, replete with its own international research center, the International Center for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) and journal, Agroforestry Systems. During the 1990s, interest in agroforestry in temperate regions increased rapidly when the scientific community discovered the complex land management systems developed by rural landowners in North America and Europe, including forest farming, alley cropping, shelterbelts, riparian buffers, and silvopastural systems (Lassoie and Buck 1999).",2003,
The Motets of Jacobus Gallus and the Doctrine of Musical Figures in the first half of the 17th Century,"The present paper represents a contribution to the study of the relation between word and tone in the works of Jacob Gallus. The author bases his study on the doctrine of musical figures as it was formulated by the theorists of the 17th century, first of all by J. Burmeister. Since Gallus' music is intimately connected with the text, the application of this doctrine to his works yields interesting results. The figures isolated by the author from the compositions of Gallus can be divided into two groups: harmonic figures, which concern the whole structure of the composition, and melodic figures, which concern the melody itself. The first harmonic figure dealt with is the fuga realis which means the occurence of imitation. This generally used technique has an intimate connection with the text, only if it occurs in the middle of a homophonic piece. Its subsidiary form is, among other things, also hypallage, a counter-fugue serving to represent a contrast of content. In this connection it is interesting to note that Gallus follows the model of Lasso in his motet Â»Peccantem me quotidieÂ« since Lasso in his composition of the same text also used a counter-fugue. As a further means of interpreting a text, the figure noema is employed, that is, a chordal passage in an otherwise polyphonic composition. This figure in contrast to imitation which illustrates the text in an image arouses a strong emotional state which results in turning the attention of the listener to the corresponding meaning of the text. Far more often than simple noema its repetitive forms analepsis and auxesis occur. The corresponding figure in polychoral compositions is anaploce which occurs in Gallus in such a characteristic form that Gallus' works were already taken by the theorists of the early 17th century as school examples of this polychoral technique. Among the harmonic figures in a narrower sense the dissonant figure syncope occuring in connection with the figures ple-onasmus and symblema, serves for effective underlining of an emotional state. In Gallus, the employment of the double subdominant, which nearly always appears in passages of heavy emotional content, belongs to specific harmonic structures. Such an employment of the double subdominant is denoted by Burmeister as the figure pathopoeia. The figure hypotyposis may comprise interpretation of strong emotional states and may illustrate the text in various ways. So it can occur, for example, as a change of a binary to ternary metre which is induced by a joyful mood in the text. In this respect Gallus' motet Â»AuditellusÂ« is interesting with its conclusion in a ternary metre. Also here, Gallus follows Lasso's composition for the same text who set to music the same passage of this text in a ternary metre. Further, the figure hypotyposis may have a melodic meaning and denotes the employment of melisma, especially of coloraturas, to the effect of underlining a special moment of the content, above all, joy. In addition, this figure serves to illustrate movement and everything that is living. Gallus made a very moderate use of melisma, but when he did employ it, the reason was nearly always provided in the contents of the text. A special example of the figure hypotyposis appears in the structure of the so-called directed melodies: anabasis â€“ an ascending melody, and katabasis â€“ a descending line. Both the figures are employed by Gallus to illustrate progress of movement and to depict strong emotions. These figures are similar to circulatio, that is, a circular melodic movement, often found in Gallus and other composers of the 16th century. The passage Â»circumderunt eumÂ« in the Passion 2, V (24, 141) and the parallel passage in Lasso has already been discussed by A. Schmitz. Like hypotyposis, the figure pathopoeia also has a melodic meaning in addition to a harmonic meaning. So Burmeister denoted the special use of semi-tonal progressions as pathopoeia, whether these are a part of tonality or not. Finally the author of the paper draws attention to the fact that Gallus, like other authors of that period, employs the general rest, denoted by Burmeister as aposiopesis, as a means of emphatic stress.",1969,Musicological Annual
Variable selection and estimation for semi-parametric multiple-index models,"In this paper, we propose a novel method to select significant variables and estimate the corresponding coefficients in multiple-index models with a group structure. All existing approaches for single-index models cannot be extended directly to handle this issue with several indices. This method integrates a popularly used shrinkage penalty such as LASSO with the group-wise minimum average variance estimation. It is capable of simultaneous dimension reduction and variable selection, while incorporating the group structure in predictors. Interestingly, the proposed estimator with the LASSO penalty then behaves like an estimator with an adaptive LASSO penalty. The estimator achieves consistency of variable selection without sacrificing the root-$n$ consistency of basis estimation. Simulation studies and a real-data example illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the new method.",2015,Bernoulli
SozioÃ¶konomischer Status undÂ Krebs,"ZusammenfassungMethodikEs wird eine Ãœbersicht Ã¼ber europÃ¤ische und deutsche Studien zum Zusammenhang zwischen sozioÃ¶konomischen Status (SES) und Krebsinzidenz sowie Ãœberleben gegeben.ErgebnisseDie Inzidenz lebensstilassoziierter Tumoren ist bei Menschen mit niedrigerem SES hÃ¶her, wÃ¤hrend bei solchen mit hÃ¶herem SES durch Screening detektierbare Krebsarten hÃ¤ufiger vorkommen. Die Ãœberlebensraten fast aller Tumoren zeigen eine positive Assoziation mit SES. Hierbei lieÃŸen sich Assoziationen fÃ¼r verschiedene Aspekte des SES wie Bildung, Beruf und Wohnsituation unabhÃ¤ngig voneinander zeigen. Diese Effekte werden wahrscheinlich durch ungesunden Lebensstil, spÃ¤te Diagnosestellung, geringe Teilnahme an FrÃ¼herkennungsprogrammen und Schwere der Begleiterkrankungen vermittelt. FlÃ¤chendeckende Krankenversicherung und gezielte KrebsplÃ¤ne erreichten in europÃ¤ischen NachbarlÃ¤ndern hÃ¤ufig benachteiligte Menschen weniger gut als Menschen mit hÃ¶herem SES.SchlussfolgerungenDer Bedarf fÃ¼r MaÃŸnahmen, die die KrebsprÃ¤vention, -erkennung und -therapie auch bei sozioÃ¶konomisch benachteiligten Menschen verbessern, ist nach wie vor nicht hinreichend gedeckt.AbstractMethodsEuropean and German studies assessing the association of socioeconomic status (SES) and cancer incidence as well as survival are reviewed.ResultsIncidence of lifestyle associated cancers shows an inverse association with SES, while screening-detectable tumors are more frequently diagnosed in people with aÂ high SES, although the two are not mutually exclusive. Survival rates are positively correlated with SES for almost all tumor sites. These associations can be shown independently for several aspects of SES such as education, type of work and housing. Such effects are likely to be mediated by factors including unhealthy lifestyle, late stage diagnosis, low participation in screening programs and, most strongly, severity of comorbidity. Universal health insurance and targeted national cancer plans in European countries have often brought larger improvements for affluent strata than for deprived groups.ConclusionsThe need for measures which improve cancer prevention, detection and therapy for socioeconomically deprived individuals persists and needs to be addressed.",2017,Forum
Accelerating band gap prediction for solar materials using feature selection and regression techniques,"Abstract We present a novel approach to apply machine learning techniques to build a more robust prediction model for band-gap energies (BG-E) of chalcopyrites, a class of materials for energy applications in the fields of solar energy, photocatalysis, and thermoelectrics. Guided by knowledge from domain experts and by previous works on the field, we aim to accelerate the discovery of new solar materials. Our objectives are two folds: (i) Identify the optimal set of features that best describes a given predicted variable. (ii) Boost prediction accuracy via applying various regression algorithms. Ordinary Least Square, Partial Least Square and Lasso regressions, combined with well adjusted feature selection techniques are applied and tested to predict the band gap energy of chalcopyrites materials. Compared to the results reported in Zeng et al. (2002), Suh et al. (1999, 2004), and Dey et al. (2014), our approach shows that learning and using only a subset of relevant features can improve the prediction accuracy by about 40 % .",2018,Computational Materials Science
Espacios De Ambiguedad En El Teatro Cervantino: La Conquista De Jerusalen Y Los Dramas De Cautiverio,"This paper is a contribution to the discussions surrounding the attribution of La conquista de Jerusalen por Godofre de Bullon. My suggestion is that those scholars who have attributed this drama to Cervantes would do well in exploring not only circumstantial, structural, linguistic, and stylistic characteristics of the play, but also the work's potential adhesion to epistemological and ethical principles that can be connected with Cervantine humanism. While my approach is not exclusively or even primarily concerned with the kind of considerations that would establish Cervantes's authorship beyond reasonable doubt, I do indeed find significant thematical, situatioual, ethical, and ideological coincidences between the anonymous drama in question anda number of Cervantine plays dealing with Mediterranean frontier spaces and hybrid religious and cultural identities. ********** NO DEJA DE SOPRENDER el hecho de que desde el descubrimiento que hizo Stefano Arata de La conquista de Jerusalen por Godofre de Bullon en la Biblioteca del Palacio Real de Madrid, alrededor de 1989, haya habido tan pocos trabajos dedicados a su estudio. Sobre todo cuando ya desde 1992, en una primera transcripcion del manuscrito anonimo publicada en Criticon, el critico italiano atribuyera tentativamente la paternidad de la obra a Cervantes por ""resultados y conjeturas provisionales"" pero del todo verosimiles (""La conquista"" 28). Que ha hecho que La conquista de Jerusalen que muestra el marchamo de ser cervantina para casi todos los que se acercan a ella no reciba una mayor atencion critica? Segun Aaron Kahn, se debe o bien a que los criticos desconocen su existencia, algo que a su juicio es la norma, o bien a que no confian en la validez de las pruebas aportadas respecto a su atribucion (""Towards a Theory"" 101). Ademas, en mi opinion, la reticencia por parte de los estudiosos podria muy bien deberse al numeroso elenco de atribuciones cervantinas falsas, (1) asi como a la dificultad que siempre entrana analizar las comedias de Cervantes, y en eso la obra que nos ocupa no le va a la zaga. En el presente trabajo examino la pieza cotejandola con otras obras cervantinas que incluyen temas de cautiverio, concretamente, El trato de Argel, La gran sultana, y Los banos de Argel. Espero con ello poder esclarecer no solo cuestiones de autoria, sino tambien resaltar elementos criticos que forman parte de las preocupaciones humanisticas del alcalaino. Como veremos, mas que centrarse puramente en los acontecimientos epicos y mostrar una vision enaltecedora del catolicismo, que de suyo traeria consigo la representacion de la primera cruzada, la comedia se afana en escenificar las consecuencias de las experiencias de cautiverio y los dramas vitales que afectan a moros, a cristianos y a las relaciones entrambos, en esa zona de contacto cultural que propicia la guerra. Se trata, al igual que en las comedias de cautivos cervantinas, de ahondar en una serie de vivencias que desvelan la precariedad de la condicion humana y denuncian actitudes hipocritas en el contexto de las guerras de religion. De esta forma, el texto abre una perspectiva que permite cuestionar la validez de ideales fatuos, como el honor o la pureza de sangre, sobre los que se sustentan la identidad cultural y religiosa espanolas. Hoy en dia, la mayoria de los criticos que la han trabajado considera que esta obra es la comedia perdida La Jerusalem, la cual Cervantes refiere haber escrito en su Adjunta al Parnaso (1614) junto a otras como Los tratos de Argel, La Numancia, La gran turquesca, La batalla naval, La Amaranta o la del mayo, El bosque amoroso, La unica y La bizarra Arsinda. Dicha pieza senalaria aun mas a Cervantes como integrante de lo que Arata llamo la ""generacion perdida"" de principios de los ochenta, cuyos dramaturgos serian, entre otros, Argensola, Francisco de la Cueva, Rey de Artieda, Virues, Juan de la Cueva, o Lobo Lasso de la Vega, y de los cuales nos han llegado muy pocos textos (""La conquista"" 9). â€¦",2012,
Health Data Driven on Continuous Blood Pressure Prediction Based on Gradient Boosting Decision Tree Algorithm,"Diseases related to issues with blood pressure are becoming a major threat to human health. With the development of telemedicine monitoring applications, a growing number of corresponding devices are being marketed, such as the use of remote monitoring for the purposes of increasing the autonomy of the elderly and thus encouraging a healthier and longer health span. Using machine learning algorithms to measure blood pressure at a continuous rate is a feasible way to provide models and analysis for telemedicine monitoring data and predicting blood pressure. For this paper, we applied the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) while predicting blood pressure rates based on the human physiological data collected by the EIMO device. EIMO equipment-specific signal acquisition includes ECG and PPG. In order to avoid over-fitting, the optimal parameters are selected via the cross-validation method. Consequently, our method has displayed a higher accuracy rate and better performance in calculating the mean absolute error evaluation index than methods, such as the traditional least squares method, ridge regression, lasso regression, ElasticNet, SVR, and KNN algorithm. When predicting the blood pressure of a single individual, calculating the systolic pressure displays an accuracy rate of above 70% and above 64% for calculating the diastolic pressure with GBDT, with the prediction time being less than 0.1 s. In conclusion, applying the GBDT is the best method for predicting the blood pressure of multiple individuals: with the inclusion of data such as age, body fat, ratio, and height, algorithm accuracy improves, which in turn indicates that the inclusion of new features aids prediction performance.",2019,IEEE Access
Penalized Regression Methods in Time Series and Functional Data Analysis,"In this thesis, we study penalized methods in time series and functional data analysis. In the first part, we introduce regularized periodograms for spectral analysis of unevenly spaced time series. The regularized periodograms, called regularized least squares periodogram and regularized quantile periodogram, are derived from trigonometric least squares and quantile regression with Group Lasso penalty. A simple model provides a theoretical justification for the use of regularized least squares periodogram as a tool for detecting hidden frequency in the time series. We give a data-dependent procedure for selection of the regularization parameter. An extensive simulation studies are conducted to examine whether our periodogram functions have the power to detect frequencies from the unevenly spaced time series with big gaps and outliers. In the second part, we propose a penalized likelihood approach for the estimation of the spectral density of a stationary time series. The approach involves L1 penalties, which were shown to be an attractive regularization device for nonparametric regression, image reconstruction, and model selection. We explore the use of penalties based on the total variation of the estimated derivatives of spectral density. An asymptotic analysis of the integrated absolute error between the estimator and the true spectral density is presented and gives a consistency result under certain regularity conditions. We also investigate the convergence of the total variation penalized Whittle likelihood estimator to the true spectral density via simulations. In the third part, we treat discrete time series data have as functional covariates in functional regression models with a scalar response. We develop an efficient",2017,
Sparse narrowband radar imaging for spinning targets with occlusion effect,"The occlusion effect of targets with the spinning motion is usually ubiquitous when illuminated by the radar. Considering this effect in Doppler imaging for spinning targets is of practical significance. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to image spinning targets with occlusion effect, which is referred to as fused Lasso based Doppler-only snapshot imaging (FLDOSI). Due to the spinning motion, the radar illuminates different parts of the target at each observation instant, which causes the backscattering intensities of the scatterers are slowly time-varying. The two-dimensional (2D) fused-Lasso model is introduced to capture this time-varying characteristic and convex programming is employed to solve the model. Finally, experiments are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed method.",2015,2015 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon)
