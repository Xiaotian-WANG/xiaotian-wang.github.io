Penalized least squares regression methods and applications to neuroimaging,"The goals of this paper are to review the most popular methods of predictor selection in regression models, to explain why some fail when the number P of explanatory variables exceeds the number N of participants, and to discuss alternative statistical methods that can be employed in this case. We focus on penalized least squares methods in regression models, and discuss in detail two such methods that are well established in the statistical literature, the LASSO and Elastic Net. We introduce bootstrap enhancements of these methods, the BE-LASSO and BE-Enet, that allow the user to attach a measure of uncertainty to each variable selected. Our work is motivated by a multimodal neuroimaging dataset that consists of morphometric measures (volumes at several anatomical regions of interest), white matter integrity measures from diffusion weighted data (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity) and clinical and demographic variables (age, education, alcohol and drug history). In this dataset, the number P of explanatory variables exceeds the number N of participants. We use the BE-LASSO and BE-Enet to provide the first statistical analysis that allows the assessment of neurocognitive performance from high dimensional neuroimaging and clinical predictors, including their interactions. The major novelty of this analysis is that biomarker selection and dimension reduction are accomplished with a view towards obtaining good predictions for the outcome of interest (i.e., the neurocognitive indices), unlike principal component analysis that are performed only on the predictors' space independently of the outcome of interest.",2011,NeuroImage

The study has not yet been finalized, these patients should be evaluated after eight weeks of the end of the intervention. The study protocol suggests a sample of 60 patients in each group, whose goal is intended to be reached later this year. Perhaps this is why some results were not different between groups, by the lack of power. However, at this point, the physical capacity tests already have shown a significant beneficial effect of exercise in this group of patients. These tests aimed at assessing dynamic balance, which is important in tasks that require quick maneuvering, such as go to the bathroom or answer the phone. There is still a scarcity of data relating to the effect of physical exercise among the most numerous group of individuals with kidney disease i.e. patients undergoing conservative treatment. In particular, there is a lack of randomized controlled studies. This study will help fill this gap. REFERENCES: Chronic kidney disease is an important public health threat. Such patients present high morbidity and mortality. There is some evidence that exercise interventions may be beneficial to chronic kidney disease patients, but previous studies included only end-stage patients, which are submitted to the dialysis treatment. This study aims to evaluate the effect of exercise on kidney function and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease among patients with chronic hypertensive kidney disease who are not undergoing dialysis. The participants were located through screening of hypertensive patients attended within the public healthcare. Eligible individuals were those with low glomerular filtration rate, measured by MDRD. The randomization was done in fixed-size blocks of six individuals. At baseline, informations on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, behavioral, anthropometric measures, blood pressure and quality-of-life were collected, also laboratory tests were performed. The intervention consisted of three weekly physical exercise sessions, lasting 60 minutes each, with a total duration of 16 weeks. The patients in both groups (intervention and control) were evaluated at the end of the intervention (16th week) and will be reassessed in the 8th week after termination.The outcomes were kidney function progression rate, functional capacity, blood pressure and laboratory. The t test was used. A two-tailed significance was level of 5%. The analyses were of intention to treat.",2012,F1000Research
"Urinary thrombomodulin levels were significantly higher following occupational exposure to chemicals, in the presence of dipstick protein, but not in the presence of dipstick blood","Currently, there are no biomarkers which can identify patients with an increased risk of developing urothelial cancer as a result of occupational chemical exposure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between final diagnosis and 22 biomarkers measured in urine, serum and plasma collected from 156 hematuric patients. Fourteen of the 80 patients (17.5%) with urothelial cancer and 13/76 (17.1%) of the controls were deemed to have a history of chemical exposure. We applied Fisher's exact tests to explore associations between chemical exposure and final diagnosis, and tumor stage and grade, where applicable; ANOVA and t-test to compare age across patients with and without chemical exposure; and Zelenâ€™s exact test to evaluate relationships across final diagnosis, chemical exposure and smoking. Following pre-selection of biomarkers using Lasso, we identified differentially expressed biomarkers across patients with and without chemical exposure using Welchâ€™s t-test. Using a one-sided t-test and considering multiple testing using FDR, we observed that TM levels in urine were significantly higher in samples from patients with a history of chemical exposure regardless of their diagnosis as control or urothelial cancer (one-sided t-test, pUC = 0.014 and pCTL = 0.043); in the presence of dipstick protein and when urinary pH levels â‰¤ 6 (p = 0.003), but not in the presence of dipstick blood (p = 0.115). Urothelial cancer patients with a history of chemical exposure were significantly younger (64.1 years) than those without chemical exposure (70.2 years) (one-sided t-test p-value = 0.012); and their tumors were higher grade (Fisherâ€™s exact test; p = 0.008). There was a strong association between a history of chemical exposure and smoking in urothelial cancer patients (Zelenâ€™s exact test; p = 0.025). Elevated urinary thrombomodulin levels could have the potential to identify chemical exposure in hematuric patients at highrisk of developing urothelial cancer",2016,Biology and medicine
An extended nonlinear state predictor for a class of nonlinear time delay systems,"Abstract An extended nonlinear state predictor (ENSP) for a classof nonlinear systems with input time delay is proposed. Based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the ENSP first estimates the current states according to the previous estimations and estimation errors, next calculates the future state values via the system model, and then adjusts the values based on the current errors. After a state predictive algorithm for a class of linear systems is presented, it is extended to a class of nonlinear time delay systems and the detailed ENSP algorithm is further proposed. Finally, computer simulations with the nonlinear example are presented, which demonstrates that the proposed ENSP can effectively and accurately predict the future states for a class of nonlinear time-delay systems no matter whether the state variables change quickly or slowly.",2004,Progress in Natural Science
A Horse Race in High Dimensional Space,"In this paper, we study the predictive power of dense and sparse estimators in a high dimensional space. We propose a new forecasting method, called Elastically Weighted Principal Components Analysis (EWPCA) that selects the variables, with respect to the target variable, taking into account the collinearity among the data using the Elastic Net soft thresholding. Then, we weight the selected predictors using the Elastic Net regression coefficient, and we finally apply the principal component analysis to the new â€œelasticallyâ€ weighted data matrix. We compare this method to common benchmark and other methods to forecast macroeconomic variables in a data-rich environment, dived into dense representation, such as Dynamic Factor Models and Ridge regressions and sparse representations, such as LASSO regression. All these models are adapted to take into account the linear dependency of the macroeconomic time series. Moreover, to estimate the hyperparameters of these models, including the EWPCA, we propose a new procedure called â€œbrute forceâ€. This method allows us to treat all the hyperparameters of the model uniformly and to take the longitudinal feature of the time-series data into account. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, the â€œbrute forceâ€ method to estimate the hyperparameters is more stable and gives better forecasting performances, in terms of MSFE, than the traditional criteria used in the literature to tune the hyperparameters. This result holds for all samples sizes and forecasting horizons. Secondly, our two-step forecasting procedure enhances the forecastsâ€™ interpretability. Lastly, the EWPCA leads to better forecasting performances, in terms of mean square forecast error (MSFE), than the other sparse and dense methods or naive benchmark, at different forecasts horizons and sample sizes.",2019,
Unknown Organ Tablature from the Early Seventeenth Century,"Abstract In the course of research on fragments from the National Museum Library, a large torso was discovered containing hitherto unknown organ tablatures from the early seventeenth century (shelf mark CZ-Pn 1 K 219). The author of the article reassemble the torso based on signatures and analyzed its content, which consists of intabulations of sacred compositions by leading Renaissance composers (e.g. Orlando di Lasso, TomÃ¡s Luis de Victoria, Jakob Handl-Gallus) as well as some lesser-known composers. On the basis of analysis, she then focused her attention on Silesia and the German-speaking milieu of northern Bohemia and Moravia, compared the tablature with similar sources from Czech and foreign collections, and placed it in the context of musical practice in the milieu of Lutheranism.",2017,Musicalia
MicroRNA dysregulational synergistic network: discovering microRNA dysregulatory modules across subtypes in non-small cell lung cancers,"BackgroundThe majority of cancer-related deaths are due to lung cancer, and there is a need for reliable diagnostic biomarkers to predict stages in non-small cell lung cancer cases. Recently, microRNAs were found to have potential as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets for lung cancer. However, some of the microRNAâ€™s functions are unknown, and their roles in cancer stage progression have been mostly undiscovered in this clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease. As evidence suggests that microRNA dysregulations are implicated in many diseases, it is essential to consider the changes in microRNA-target regulation across different lung cancer subtypes.ResultsWe proposed a pipeline to identify microRNA synergistic modules with similar dysregulation patterns across multiple subtypes by constructing the MicroRNA Dysregulational Synergistic Network. From the network, we extracted microRNA modules and incorporated them as prior knowledge to the Sparse Group Lasso classifier. This leads to a more relevant selection of microRNA biomarkers, thereby improving the cancer stage classification accuracy. We applied our method to the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma and the Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma datasets. In cross-validation tests, the area under ROC curve rate for the cancer stages prediction has increased considerably when incorporating the learned microRNA dysregulation modules. The extracted modules from multiple independent subtypes differential analyses were found to have high agreement with microRNA family annotations, and they can also be used to identify mutual biomarkers between different subtypes. Among the top-ranked candidate microRNAs selected by the model, 87% were reported to be related to Lung Adenocarcinoma. The overall result demonstrates that clustering microRNAs from the dysregulation pattern between microRNAs and their targets leads to biomarkers with high precision and recall rate to known differentially expressed disease-associated microRNAs.ConclusionsThe results indicated that our method improves microRNA biomarker selection by detecting similar microRNA dysregulational synergistic patterns across the multiple subtypes. Since microRNA-target dysregulations are implicated in many cancers, we believe this tool can have broad applications for discovery of novel microRNA biomarkers in heterogeneous cancer diseases.",2018,BMC Bioinformatics
Comparison of scoring methods for the detection of causal genes with or without rare variants,"Rare causal variants are believed to significantly contribute to the genetic basis of common diseases or quantitative traits. Appropriate statistical methods are required to discover the highest possible number of disease-relevant variants in a genome-wide screening study. The publicly available Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 data set consists of 697 individuals and 24,487 genetic variants. It includes a simulated complex disease model with intermediate quantitative phenotypes. We compare four gene-wise scoring methods with respect to ranking of causal genes under variable allele frequency thresholds for collapsing of rare variants and considering whether or not rare variants were included. We also compare causal genes for which the ranks differ clearly between scoring methods regarding such characteristics as number and strength of causal variants. We corroborated our findings with additional simulations. We found that the maximum statistics method was superior in assigning high ranks to genes with a single strong causal variant. Hotellingâ€™s T2 test was superior for genes with several independent causal variants. This was consistent for all phenotypes and was confirmed by single-gene analyses and additional simulations. The multivariate analysis performed similarly to Hotellingâ€™s T2 test. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis was widely comparable with the maximum statistics method. We conclude that the maximum statistics method is a superior alternative to Hotellingâ€™s T2 test if one expects only one independent causal variant per gene with a dominating effect. Such a variant could also be a supermarker derived by collapsing rare variants. Because the true nature of the genetic effect is unknown for real data, both methods need to be taken into consideration.",2011,BMC Proceedings
"Identification and biological characteristics of Thalassodes immissaria, an emerald moth infesting litchi.","The species of emerald moth that infested litchi and longan was identified as Thalassodes immissaria(Walker) not as identified as Pelagodes proquadraria(Inoue) before by field survey and analysis of male genitalia.The biological charac-teristics and occurrence pattern of T.immissaria were studied.The larva of T.immissaria can be divided into 5 instars based on Dyarâ€™s law.Adults showed sexual dimorphism,which the antenna of female moth was filiform and that of male moth was plumose.T.immissaria made damage to litchi and longan young leaves and twigs by larvae and occurred 7 to 8 generations a year in Guangdong province.The full-grown larva spun silk to combine the leaves around itself and turned into pupa in the combination.Eggs were laid singly in finial and edge of young leaves.Under the laboratory condition,the developmental du-ration of egg,pupa,1st to 5th instar larva and pre-oviposition was 3.64,6.67,2.76,2.80,3.42,3.89,5.16,and 1.63 d respec-tively at 26 â„ƒ.",2010,Journal of Fruit Science
Fine-Grained Entity Typing via Hierarchical Multi Graph Convolutional Networks,"This paper addresses the problem of inferring the fine-grained type of an entity from a knowledge base. We convert this problem into the task of graph-based semi-supervised classification, and propose Hierarchical Multi Graph Convolutional Network (HMGCN), a novel Deep Learning architecture to tackle this problem. We construct three kinds of connectivity matrices to capture different kinds of semantic correlations between entities. A recursive regularization is proposed to model the subClassOf relations between types in given type hierarchy. Extensive experiments with two large-scale public datasets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art methods.",2019,
Profil Ã©pidÃ©miologique et clinique des infirmitÃ©s motrices cÃ©rÃ©brales au Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso),"Introduction: Cerebral palsy is the leading cause of motor disability in children. Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical profiles of cerebral palsy in children seen at the University Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso. Population and methods: This is a descriptive cross-acted study prospectively conducted at the Department of Physical Medicine at University Hospital of Bobo- Dioulasso over a period of one year from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013. Our study population consisted of all children aged between 0 and 15 years received during the consultation period of the study and having a cerebral palsy table. Results: We studied 174 patients including 106 boys and 68 girls. The mean age was 32.79 months. Etiological factors were dominated by prematurity (34.5%) and cerebral anoxia (25.86%). The main clinical presentations were diplegia (50%), quadriplegia (19.54%), hemiplegia (14.37%), monoplegia (10.34%) and triplegia (5.75%). The most common associated symptoms were epilepsy (15%), eye disorders (12.6%), and hearing problems (10%). Conclusion: Due to its frequency and disabling potential, cerebral palsy is a major public health problem in Burkina Faso. Its support in the African environment is heavily complicated by self-medication and traditional therapy.",2014,
"Cross-Validation, Shrinkage and Variable Selection in Linear Regression Revisited","In deriving a regression model analysts often have to use variable 
selection, despite of problems introduced by data- dependent model 
building. Resampling approaches are proposed to handle some of the critical 
issues. In order to assess and compare several strategies, we will conduct a 
simulation study with 15 predictors and a complex correlation structure in 
the linear regression model. Using sample sizes of 100 and 400 and estimates of 
the residual variance corresponding to R2 of 0.50 and 0.71, we consider 4 scenarios with varying amount of information. 
We also consider two examples with 24 and 13 predictors, respectively. We will 
discuss the value of cross-validation, shrinkage and backward 
elimination (BE) with varying significance level. We will assess whether 2-step 
approaches using global or parameterwise shrinkage (PWSF) can improve selected models and will compare results to 
models derived with the LASSO procedure. Beside of MSE we will use model 
sparsity and further criteria for model assessment. The amount of information 
in the data has an influence on the selected models and the comparison of the 
procedures. None of the approaches was best in all scenarios. The 
performance of backward elimination with a suitably chosen significance level 
was not worse compared to the LASSO and BE models selected were much sparser, 
an important advantage for interpretation and transportability. Compared to 
global shrinkage, PWSF had better performance. Provided that the amount of 
information is not too small, we conclude that BE followed by PWSF is a suitable 
approach when variable selection is a key part of data analysis.",2013,Open Journal of Statistics
Sparse Regression Incorporating Graphical Structure among Predictors.,"With the abundance of high dimensional data in various disciplines, sparse regularized techniques are very popular these days. In this paper, we make use of the structure information among predictors to improve sparse regression models. Typically, such structure information can be modeled by the connectivity of an undirected graph using all predictors as nodes of the graph. Most existing methods use this undirected graph edge-by-edge to encourage the regression coefficients of corresponding connected predictors to be similar. However, such methods do not directly utilize the neighborhood information of the graph. Furthermore, if there are more edges in the predictor graph, the corresponding regularization term will be more complicate. In this paper, we incorporate the graph information node-by-node, instead of edge-by-edge as used in most existing methods. Our proposed method is very general and it includes adaptive Lasso, group Lasso, and ridge regression as special cases. Both theoretical and numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for simultaneous estimation, prediction and model selection.",2016,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Association between serotonin transporter gene polymorphism and eating disorders: a meta-analytic study.,"OBJECTIVE
Compelling evidence has suggested a role for serotonin system dysfunction in the pathogenesis of eating disorders (EDs), including anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). Studies have examined the association between EDs and a functional polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene promoter (5-HTTLPR). These studies have yielded inconsistent results. The present study aimed to determine conclusively whether there is an association by using a meta-analytic method.


METHOD
Data of over 2,000 participants from eight independent case-controlassociation studies were pooled by using a random effects model.


RESULTS
AN was found to be significantly associated with the S allele (p < .001) and S carrier (SS + LS) genotype (p = .007). However, BN was associated neither with the S allele (p = .49) nor with the S carrier genotype (p = .33).


DISCUSSION
These results suggested that the genetic variance of the serotonin transporter gene promoter contributed to the susceptibility of AN.",2010,The International journal of eating disorders
"1 Proving the Principle of Logic: Quentin Meillassoux, Jean-Luc Nancy, and the Anhypothetical","Since the birth of philosophy itself, thinkers have been searching for the principle of all logic: not a logical proof but the proof of the validity of logic itself. Both Plato and Aristotle call this principle of logic the ""anhypothetical principle"": the principle that does not need to be hypothesized. The anhypothetical for both Plato and Aristotle is not simply an object of dialectic, but at the origin of dialectic. In one contemporary re-working of this theme of the anhypothetical, Quentin Meillassoux seeks to strengthen the Aristotelian form of the anhypothetical and offers an anhypothetical demonstration the principle of non-contradiction which, he claims, is of unprecedented rigour. This chapter shows that Meillassoux's proof of the principle of factiality is itself vulnerable to disproof by the same indirect means through which he seeks to establish it. This argument takes one on a detour through the thought of Jean-Luc Nancy. Keywords: anhypothetical principle; Aristotle; Jean-Luc Nancy; Quentin Meillassoux",2014,

To this end, we have applied various recent methods from multivariate statistics and machine learning: graphical Gaussian models, sparse Bayesian regression, LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), Bayesian networks, and nested effects models. We have investigated the degree of similarity between the predictions obtained with the different approaches, and we have assessed the consistency of the reconstructed networks in terms of global topological network properties, based on the node degree distribution.

On regularized estimation methods for precision and covariance matrix and statistical network inference,"Estimation of the covariance matrix is an important problem in statistics in general because the covariance matrix is an essential part of principal component analysis, statistical pattern recognition, multivariate regression and network exploration, just to mention but a few applications. Penalized likelihood methods are used when standard estimates cannot be computed. This is a common case when the number of explanatory variables is much larger compared to the sample size (high-dimensional case). An alternative ridge-type estimator for the precision matrix estimation is introduced in Article I. This estimate is derived using a penalized likelihood estimation method. Undirected networks, which are connected to penalized covariance and precision matrix estimation and some applications related to networks are also explored in this dissertation. In Article II novel statistical methods are used to infer population networks from discrete measurements of genetic data. More precisely, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, LASSO for short, is applied in neighborhood selection. This inferred network is used for more detailed inference of population structures. We illustrate how community detection can be a promising tool in population structure and admixture exploration of genetic data. In addition, in Article IV it is shown how the precision matrix estimator introduced in Article I can be used in graphical model selection via a multiple hypothesis testing procedure. Article III in this dissertation contains a review of current tools for practical graphical model selection and precision/covariance matrix estimation. The other three publications have detailed descriptions of the fundamental computational and mathematical results which create a basis for the methods presented in these articles. Each publication contains a collection of practical research questions where the novel methods can be applied. We hope that these applications will help readers to better understand the possible applications of the methods presented in this dissertation.",2018,
"Latest Cretaceous storm-generated sea grass accumulations in the Maastrichtian type area, the Netherlands â€“ preliminary observations","Abstract Ever since the first description of fossil material during the mid-nineteenth century, sea grass has been shown to be quite commonly preserved in â€˜pocketsâ€™ or â€˜clumpsâ€™ at certain levels within the Gulpen, Maastricht and Kunrade formations in southern Limburg (the Netherlands) and contiguous areas in northeast Belgium. In those places where silicification occurred during early diagenesis, even completely silicified and three-dimensionally preserved stems and roots can be found, mostly of Thalassocharis bosquetii, in association with fully marine molluscs such as dentaliid scaphopods and a range of larger foraminifera, bivalves, gastropods and ammonites. Such occurrences are best known from the Valkenburg, Gronsveld and Emael members of the Maastricht Formation in the Eben Emael (Liege, Belgium) and Sint-Pietersberg (Maastricht, the Netherlands) areas. However, accumulations of sea grasses, littering the sea floor over a considerable areal extent, were never as well observed as in a gully-fill that was discovered and partly excavated in the uppermost Gronsveld Member at the ENCI-HeidelbergCement Group quarry in October 2015. Our preliminary results concern the palaeoenvironment and taphonomy of this deposit and identify some of the more notable members of the associated biota, such as an astropectinid asteroid.",2019,
"Species Composition and Diversity of Marine Nematode Community on Intertidal Mudflat in Zhongzhai,Xiamen","Three sampling stations on mudflat in Zhongzhai Xiamen were designed to investigate free living marine nematode. 48 species of marine nematodes were collected during February and May sampling. They belong to 41 Genera, 19 Families and 3 Orders. All of them were first recorded on Xiamen intertidal zone. The dominant species were Dorylaimopsis variabilis , Viscosia sp., Daptonema sp1., Sphaerolaimus balticus and Thalassomonhystera sp. The densities of marine nematodes increased from higher mudflat to lower mudflat. There was obvious difference in species composition of marine nematodes between February and May according to cluster analysis and Multi Dimensional Scaling analysis. The species number and species diversity index of marine nematodes on intertidal mudflat in Xiamen Zhongzhai were respectively fewer and lower than those in Taiwan Strait, but the density on intertidal mudflat in Xiamen Zhongzhai was higher than those in Taiwan Strait.

Probabilistic Hourly Load Forecasting Using Additive Quantile Regression Models,"Short-term hourly load forecasting in South Africa using additive quantile regression (AQR) models is discussed in this study. The modelling approach allows for easy interpretability and accounting for residual autocorrelation in the joint modelling of hourly electricity data. A comparative analysis is done using generalised additive models (GAMs). In both modelling frameworks, variable selection is done using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) via hierarchical interactions. Four models considered are GAMs and AQR models with and without interactions, respectively. The AQR model with pairwise interactions was found to be the best fitting model. The forecasts from the four models were then combined using an algorithm based on the pinball loss (convex combination model) and also using quantile regression averaging (QRA). The AQR model with interactions was then compared with the convex combination and QRA models and the QRA model gave the most accurate forecasts. Except for the AQR model with interactions, the other two models (convex combination model and QRA model) gave prediction interval coverage probabilities that were valid for the 90 % , 95 % and the 99 % prediction intervals. The QRA model had the smallest prediction interval normalised average width and prediction interval normalised average deviation. The modelling framework discussed in this paper has established that going beyond summary performance statistics in forecasting has merit as it gives more insight into the developed forecasting models.",2018,Energies
GLMMLasso: An Algorithm for High-Dimensional Generalized Linear Mixed Models Using â„“1-Penalization,We propose an l1-penalized algorithm for fitting high-dimensional generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). GLMMs can be viewed as an extension of generalized linear models for clustered observations. Our Lasso-type approach for GLMMs should be mainly used as variable screening method to reduce the number of variables below the sample size. We then suggest a refitting by maximum likelihood based on the selected variables only. This is an effective correction to overcome problems stemming from the variable screening procedure that are more severe with GLMMs than for generalized linear models. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on simulated as well as on real data examples. Supplementary materials are available online and the algorithm is implemented in the R package glmmixedlasso.,2014,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
Representing local structure in Bayesian networks by Boolean functions,"Abstract A number of studies on learning Bayesian networks have emphasized the importance of exploiting regularities in conditional probability distributions, i.e., local structure. In this paper, we encode local structures as linear combinations of Boolean functions. By using Lasso, we can simultaneously estimate the structure and parameters of the networks from limited data. We demonstrate that the method leads to improved performance in terms of structural correctness as well as prediction score even when the local structure in the underlying model is only implicit.",2017,Pattern Recognit.

Autoregressive Model for Individual Consumption Data - LASSO Selection and Significance Test,"Understanding user flexibility and behavior patterns is becoming increasingly vital to the design of robust and efficient energy saving programs. Accurate prediction of consumption is a key part to this understanding. Existing prediction methods usually have high relative errors that can be larger than 30\%. In this paper, we explore sparsity in users' past data and relationship between different users to increase prediction accuracy. We show that using LASSO and significance test techniques, prediction accuracy can be significantly compared to standard existing algorithms. We use mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as the criteria.",2015,ArXiv
A Path Algorithm for Constrained Estimation.,"Many least-square problems involve affine equality and inequality constraints. Although there are a variety of methods for solving such problems, most statisticians find constrained estimation challenging. The current article proposes a new path-following algorithm for quadratic programming that replaces hard constraints by what are called exact penalties. Similar penalties arise in l1 regularization in model selection. In the regularization setting, penalties encapsulate prior knowledge, and penalized parameter estimates represent a trade-off between the observed data and the prior knowledge. Classical penalty methods of optimization, such as the quadratic penalty method, solve a sequence of unconstrained problems that put greater and greater stress on meeting the constraints. In the limit as the penalty constant tends to âˆž, one recovers the constrained solution. In the exact penalty method, squared penalties!are replaced by absolute value penalties, and the solution is recovered for a finite value of the penalty constant. The exact path-following method starts at the unconstrained solution and follows the solution path as the penalty constant increases. In the process, the solution path hits, slides along, and exits from the various constraints. Path following in Lasso penalized regression, in contrast, starts with a large value of the penalty constant and works its way downward. In both settings, inspection of the entire solution path is revealing. Just as with the Lasso and generalized Lasso, it is possible to plot the effective degrees of freedom along the solution path. For a strictly convex quadratic program, the exact penalty algorithm can be framed entirely in terms of the sweep operator of regression analysis. A few well-chosen examples illustrate the mechanics and potential of path following.

[An epidemic of measles in Burkina Faso: 714 cases hospitalized in the hospital at Bobo-Dioulasso. A study of risk factors].,"From January 1986 through June 1987, 714 children with measles were admitted to the Pediatric Department of the Sanou Souro Hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina-Faso. Eighty-four per cent of cases occurred during the first semester of 1987. Sixty per cent of patients were 9 to 35 months of age. The case-fatality rate was 29.1% (31.5% during the first semester of 1987, 12% in 1986). Fifty-five per cent of deaths occurred within 24 hours of admission. The most common clinical features upon admission included dehydration (91% of patients), diarrhea (64%), conjunctivitis (56%), fever in excess of 39.5 degrees C (50%), respiratory infection (46%), and cardiovascular collapse (34.5%). Factors associated with a fatal outcome included dehydration and cardiovascular collapse, poor nutritional status, and occurrence of the disease during the dry season (March, April, May). In most cases, immunization status of affected children was unknown. The high mortality rate can be ascribed to the significant delay with which medical care was provided, due in part to the inadequacy of primary health care facilities. This outbreak denotes the inadequacy of immunization against this disease that is included in the Extended Immunization Program.",1989,Annales de pediatrie
Indirect Comparison of Interaction Graphs,Astrategy for testing differential conditional independence structures (CIS) between two graphs is introduced.

The diagnostic value of power spectra analysis of the sleep electroencephalography in narcoleptic patients.,"OBJECTIVE
Manifestations of narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) include disturbed nocturnal sleep - hereunder sleep-wake instability, decreased latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and dissociated REM sleep events. In this study, we characterized the electroencephalography (EEG) of various sleep stages in NC versus controls.


METHODS
EEG power spectral density (PSD) was computed in 136 NC patients and 510 sex- and age-matched controls. Features reflecting differences in PSD curves were computed. A Lasso-regularized regression model was used to find an optimal feature subset, which was validated on 19 NC patients and 708 non-NC patients from a sleep clinic. Reproducible features were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.


RESULTS
Thirteen features were selected based on the training dataset. Three were applicable in the validation dataset, indicating that NC patients show (1) increased alpha power in REM sleep, (2) decreased sigma power in wakefulness, and (3) decreased delta power in stage N1 versus wakefulness. Sensitivity of these features ranged from 4% to 10% with specificity around 98%, and it did not vary substantially with and without treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
EEG spectral analysis of REM sleep, wake, and differences between N1 and wakefulness contain diagnostic features of NC. These traits may represent sleepiness and dissociated REM sleep in patients with NC. However, the features are not sufficient for differentiating NC from controls, and further analysis is needed to completely evaluate the diagnostic potential of these features.",2015,Sleep medicine
Scaled and square-root elastic net,"In scaled lasso, the unknown regression coefficients and the scale parameter of the error distribution are estimated jointly. In lasso, the optimal penalty parameter is well-known to depend on the error scale, and it is therefore typically chosen using cross-validation. The main benefit of scaled lasso is that the penalty parameter is scale-free and can be predetermined from pure theoretical considerations. Nevertheless, scaled lasso performs poorly when there exist strong correlations between the predictors. As a remedy, we propose two different scaled elastic net (EN) formulations and derive convergent algorithms for their computation. The first formulation uses a conventional EN penalty whereas the second formulation differs from the former in that the â„“2-loss is not squared. The former approach is referred to as the scaled EN estimator and the latter as the square-root EN estimator. We illustrate via numerical examples and simulations that the proposed methods outperform the scaled lasso, especially in the presence of high mutual coherence in the feature space.",2017,"2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Sparse Representation for Tumor Classification Based on Feature Extraction Using Latent Low-Rank Representation,"Accurate tumor classification is crucial to the proper treatment of cancer. To now, sparse representation (SR) has shown its great performance for tumor classification. This paper conceives a new SR-based method for tumor classification by using gene expression data. In the proposed method, we firstly use latent low-rank representation for extracting salient features and removing noise from the original samples data. Then we use sparse representation classifier (SRC) to build tumor classification model. The experimental results on several real-world data sets show that our method is more efficient and more effective than the previous classification methods including SVM, SRC, and LASSO.",2014,BioMed Research International
Signatures of Mechanically Interlocked Topology of Lasso Peptides by Ion Mobilityâ€“Mass Spectrometry: Lessons from a Collection of Representatives,"AbstractLasso peptides are characterized by a mechanically interlocked structure, where the C-terminal tail of the peptide is threaded and trapped within an N-terminal macrolactam ring. Their compact and stable structures have a significant impact on their biological and physical properties and make them highly interesting for drug development. Ion mobility - mass spectrometry (IM-MS) has shown to be effective to discriminate the lasso topology from their corresponding branched-cyclic topoisomers in which the C-terminal tail is unthreaded. In fact, previous comparison of the IM-MS data of the two topologies has yielded three trends that allow differentiation of the lasso fold from the branched-cyclic structure: (1) the low abundance of highly charged ions, (2) the low change in collision cross sections (CCS) with increasing charge state and (3) a narrow ion mobility peak width. In this study, a three-dimensional plot was generated using three indicators based on these three trends: (1) mean charge divided by mass (Î¶), (2) relative range of CCS covered by all protonated molecules (Î”Î©/Î©) and (3) mean ion mobility peak width (Î´Î©). The data were first collected on a set of twenty one lasso peptides and eight branched-cyclic peptides. The indicators were obtained also for eight variants of the well-known lasso peptide MccJ25 obtained by site-directed mutagenesis and further extended to five linear peptides, two macrocyclic peptides and one disulfide constrained peptide. In all cases, a clear clustering was observed between constrained and unconstrained structures, thus providing a new strategy to discriminate mechanically interlocked topologies.

Optimal segmentation of classification and prediction maps for monitoring forest condition with spectral and spatial information from hyperspectral data,"Fusion of spectral and spatial information has good potential for building highly accurate classification model for land cover and prediction model for biomass estimation. In this study, a new method with spectral-spatial this fusion and object-based segmentation for monitoring peat swamp forest condition is proposed. Peatland is a major CO2 emission source by peat burn, peat decomposition and forest fire. Remote sensing is effective tool for monitoring environmental condition of peatland and forest ecosystem. For the monitoring, forest type classification map and biomass distribution map are useful for understanding about the forest condition and to estimate mass volume of CO2 storage. In order to have enough accurate maps without overfitting problem, sparse discrimination analysis (SDA) was applied to spectral and spatial information from hyperspectral data for the classification model, and LASSO regression was applied for the biomass prediction model. Furthermore, to obtain the well-segmented maps, mean shift clustering as object-based segmentation was applied to those maps for identifying suitable class and biomass with majority voting in each segmentation. These proposed scheme improved classification and prediction accuracies and provides accurate segmented maps.",2014,2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium
A Power and Prediction Analysis for Knockoffs with Lasso Statistics,"Knockoffs is a new framework for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing problems involving complex statistical models. While there has been great emphasis on Type-I error control, Type-II errors have been far less studied. In this paper we analyze the false negative rate or, equivalently, the power of a knockoff procedure associated with the Lasso solution path under an i.i.d. Gaussian design, and find that knockoffs asymptotically achieve close to optimal power with respect to an omniscient oracle. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for sparse signals, performing model selection via knockoff filtering achieves nearly ideal prediction errors as compared to a Lasso oracle equipped with full knowledge of the distribution of the unknown regression coefficients. The i.i.d. Gaussian design is adopted to leverage results concerning the empirical distribution of the Lasso estimates, which makes power calculation possible for both knockoff and oracle procedures.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Understanding Hydrologic Processes and Correlations using Modeling and Machine Learning with Remote Sensing and In-Situ Wireless Sensor Network Data,"This work addresses three challenging issues about the overall applicability of hydrologic modelling. The first challenge is improving the collection of sub-surface data. Our approach uses a long-term deployment of wireless sensor network with environmental sensors. This approach is cost-effective when compared with the use of data-loggers and more flexible as it allows real-time monitoring of environmental variables. The plot scale environmental data is collected from our own WSN, deployed in western Pennsylvania, currently composed by 104 nodes and over 240 sensors including commercially available soil moisture, water potential and temperature sensors along with lab-made xylem sap flow sensors. 
The second challenge is improving the availability and accuracy of continuous streamflow time-series estimates. The hydrometric network is modelled as a sparse Gaussian graphical model where each site represents a node in a graph. The graph model will have an edge between two sites only when their streamflow time-series are conditionally dependent given the other sites. A novel algorithm is presented, estimating a sparse graph by imposing sparsity to the precision (covariance inverse) matrix via the Graphical Lasso algorithm. The resulting graph is used for inference and a second algorithm determines which gauges can be removed with the least loss of information. The estimated streamflow time-series have better accuracy that other methods based on geographic proximity (least distance) or marginal correlation. 
The third challenge is estimating the soil-water characteristics from biased and noisy observations of soil moisture. A novel method is presented for the simultaneous estimation of soil moisture and soil-related parameters. The simulation of soil moisture is performed using the Noah and the VIC models. The simulated site is a well-documented testbed in the state of Oklahoma. The calibration of the soil-related parameters uses Machine Learning techniques such as clustering, regression and classification, and soil-water correlations, providing physical and statistical constrains in the parameter space. Thus, the search is made within a reduced parameter space which makes the parameter calibration approach more effective and realistic. The performance of

the calibration algorithm is assessed regarding the quality of the soil moisture estimations while keeping the parameters in a feasible range",2019,
Recognition of similar characters using gradient features of discriminative regions,"Abstract One important and challenging issue in handwritten character recognition is the discrimination of visually similar characters. In this paper, we propose a character recognition method for distinguishing similar characters by augmenting commonly used image feature with gradient features from potentially discriminative image regions. The discriminative regions of similar characters sets are automatically detected by analysing the weight vectors of the sparsity promoting logistic fused Lasso method. The histogram of oriented gradients is adopted to compactly represent the gradient features. Additionally, the locality preserving projection method is employed to alleviate the high dimensional nature of the resulting feature vectors. Experimental results on handwritten Lanna Dhamma and Thai characters datasets demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in discriminating visually similar characters. The method also outperforms existing character recognition methods by considerable margins. It has a great potential for character recognition of other alphabets.",2019,Expert Syst. Appl.
"Palynology From the Cenomanian Mata Amarilla Formation, Southern Patagonia, Argentina","Abstract The critical climatic changes that occurred during the Albianâ€“Turonian Cretaceous interval led to a major biotic turnover, both in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Several large-scale palynological works have been conducted in the Northern Hemisphere, but information for the Southern Hemisphere remains scarce. Particularly for southern South America, there are only a few palynological works focused on this important time interval. We report here, a diverse palynoflora recovered from the Cenomanian Mata Amarilla Formation, southern Patagonia, Argentina. The palynological assemblage is composed of 64 species within 47 genera. Three new species are here defined: Polycingulatisporites multiverrucata sp. nov., Clavatisporites cenomaniana sp. nov. and Collarisporites minor sp. nov., and 18 species are first recorded for southern South America. Cluster analysis including several Albianâ€“Turonian palynofloras of middle and high latitudes of eastern and western Gondwana show that Patagonian palynofloras are clustered together, sharing a great compositional similarity, but with features common to those of the Antarctic Peninsula and New Zealand. The Mata Amarilla Formation palynofloras here presented show characteristics of the Cyclusphaera psilata-Classopollis Sub-province, extending its stratigraphic range into the Cenomanian. This palynoflora fits well with the evolutionary scheme of angiosperms previously proposed for Argentina, and adds a new characteristic taxon (cf. Dichastopollenites sp.). The presence of Albianâ€“Cenomanian megaspore species (Arcellites disciformis and Balmeisporites sp. cf. B. holodictyus), the abundance of common elements of the Early Cretaceous Patagonian assemblages (e.g. Classopollis and Cyclusphaera), and the relative scarcity of angiosperm pollen grains support a Cenomanian age for the Mata Amarilla Formation.",2020,Cretaceous Research
Tensor Decomposition With Generalized Lasso Penalties,"ABSTRACTWe present an approach for penalized tensor decomposition (PTD) that estimates smoothly varying latent factors in multiway data. This generalizes existing work on sparse tensor decomposition and penalized matrix decompositions, in a manner parallel to the generalized lasso for regression and smoothing problems. Our approach presents many nontrivial challenges at the intersection of modeling and computation, which are studied in detail. An efficient coordinate-wise optimization algorithm for PTD is presented, and its convergence properties are characterized. The method is applied both to simulated data and real data on flu hospitalizations in Texas and motion-capture data from video cameras. These results show that our penalized tensor decomposition can offer major improvements on existing methods for analyzing multiway data that exhibit smooth spatial or temporal features.",2015,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
Resonating Ontologies : The Illusory Nature of the Confrontation Between Å½iÅ¾ek ' s Ontology and Speculative Realism,"There are two main currents of thought in Continental philosophy emerging today â€“ the speculative realists (via: Graham Harman and Meillassoux) and the post-continental Marxists (via: Å½iÅ¾ek and Badiou). The two camps have propped themselves against each other, with the speculative realists giving especially acerbic critiques of post-continentalism as being stuck in correlationist thought (while the latter just tend to ignore the former, considering them a philosophy not worthy of exposition). This paper argues that this confrontation is an illusion: the fundamental ontologies of both groups essentially rely on a single concept â€“ that of the non-All â€“ that structures the rest of their thought. Further, it is only by overcoming the illusory nature of this confrontation that we can unleash the full potential of both these fields. Let's compare two contemporary competing ontologies present in Continental philosophy as it stands today: (1) Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ekâ€™s ontology, as outlined by Adrian Johnston, is primarily concerned with trying to justify a Transcendental Materialist Theory of Subjectivity (TMTS). Subjectivity, for Å½iÅ¾ek, is materialist because it has a concrete material base: thereâ€™s a definite link between the interplay and structure of neurons in our bodies and our everyday experience of â€˜being consciousâ€™ â€“ the former somehow provides the basis and gives rise to the second. The term â€˜gives riseâ€™ is crucial here: the transcendental aspect of consciousness, the phenomenological aspect of â€˜being consciousâ€™ and of being something â€˜moreâ€™ that a purely material base is intimately tied together with the material aspect. The question thus arises: how does a purely material base give rise to a transcendental experience of consciousness? The answer, for Å½iÅ¾ek, can be found only if we consider material as being always-already non-All; that is to say, the constitutive fact about objects, about â€˜material,â€™ is that they are essentially a void, absent â€“ they are always undercut in their very â€˜being-there.â€™ (2) Graham Harman, in contrast, is primarily concerned not with subjectivity, but with trying to find a way of thinking objects in their raw, physical materiality. He utilizes the phenomenological theories of Husserl and Heidegger, among others, to try and create a speculative realist philosophy that can ontologically describe objects â€“ an ontology termed â€˜Object-Oriented Ontologyâ€™ (OOO, for short). Harman utilizes Heideggerâ€™s analysis of being â€“ most notably that being is never â€˜presentâ€™ â€“ along with his famous tool-analysis, to show that objects are hidden away from conscious study and experience; theyâ€™re untotalizable. This idea doesn't just mean that you can't describe the totality of objects by gathering them and listing their defining qualities: it also means that every object has qualities that hide Res Cogitans (2012) 3:1 Hall | 68 2155-4838 | commons.pacificu.edu/rescogitans away from any sort of conscious exploration. Objects are always torn apart in this way â€“ they both present themselves and recede from any presentation at the same time. In doing this, they lock themselves within logical relations that allow us to talk about objects in-themselves, even if only by â€˜lookingâ€™ at them awry. Though these two ontologies present themselves as being fundamentally opposed, they share (at least) one structural â€˜quilting pointâ€™ that binds them together: the concept that objects are always-already nonAll, voided, and non-present to human cognition. Itâ€™s the thesis of this paper that both Å½iÅ¾ekâ€™s TMTS and Harmanâ€™s OOO are compatible, and even supplement each other, despite their apparent tensions. They canâ€™t be bound together though on their own though: the point that binds them together is Meillassouxâ€™s Speculative Realist ontology presented in his â€˜After Finitude.â€™ These three pieces balance each other out, and help fill in one another's gaps. This essay aims to create a preliminary sketch of these interweaving ontologies, so as to bring their respective possibilities to light. Given that, this essay will continue in the following way: (1) It will briefly outline Meillassouxâ€™s and Harmanâ€™s theories. (2) It will attempt to weave together these two theories. (3) It will introduce Å½iÅ¾ekâ€™s ontology as structured by Adrian Johnston. (4) It will merge some of the ideas presented in (3) with those synthesized in (2). The aim here, again, is to show that these theories complement each other, not that they fall into one another on a one-to-one basis. This should be kept in mind while evaluating this essay. Finally, in conclusion, this essay hopes to end by noting some reasons for this philosophical merging, and to flesh out some reasons for its difficulty. I. Harman and Meillassoux: Realism Revisited A. Explanations of a Speculative Realist Philosophy: Speculative realism has come like a shot of thunder in the realm of philosophy, especially for Continental philosophy. For too long now, philosophy has seemed to have avoided some of the most basic questions of philosophy â€“ that is, metaphysical questions. Where such questions were present, they were hidden in cloaks of undecipherable poetic language, or they were deemed as nonsense based on â€˜confusions within languageâ€™. Speculative Realism has tried to bring these questions back into the forefront of philosophical examinations, explicitly. Amidst the rabble of the â€˜end of metaphysics,â€™ they have the courage to bring the discussion back to fundamental elements â€“ that is, the question of realism versus idealism. Meillassouxâ€™s â€œAfter Finitudeâ€ presents us with one of the best analyses of this question, showing us a new light to cast the debate in, along with giving us a truly radical way to think objects in-themselves. The whole point of Meillassouxâ€™s book is try to and â€œunderstand how science can think a world wherein spatio-temporal givenness itself came into being within a time and a space which preceded every variety of givennessâ€ (Meillassoux p. 22, emphasis removed). To put it another way, Meillassoux is trying to figure out a way to analyze what he calls â€˜ancestralâ€™ statements â€“ that is, scientific statements (such as those describing the creation of the world, or the beginning of the universe) that point to a time existing before any sort of human perception of it could have occurred. To think these statements is to be thrust Res Cogitans (2012) 3:1 Hall | 69 2155-4838 | commons.pacificu.edu/rescogitans head first into the debate over realism, because ancestral statements, by definition, contain a described object but lack some sort of human consciousness to describe it in terms of presence. Post-Kantian philosophy has trouble in trying to think these ancestral statements though, because it is dominated by what Meillassoux terms â€˜correlationism.â€™ Correlationist philosophies believe that â€œwe only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the otherâ€ (Meillassoux, p. 5) â€“ in other words, those philosophies that dominate both the analytic and continental traditions that believe that either language and being, or world and being are the only two modes of thought that are legitimate (e.g. Wittgenstein and Heidegger respectively). That is, the correlationist can think ancestral statements, but only â€˜for usâ€™ â€“ they can only think the beginning of the world â€˜for us.â€™ In doing this, they drive a wedge between scientific discourse, and a philosophy that looks down on the scientific disciplines for not having considered things in the same logical manner. Philosophy â€˜allowsâ€™ science to continue its business, with the knowledge of scienceâ€™s theoretical error passed by in silence, never going so far as to question its own presuppositions. Speculative Realism allows for a contrary opinion, one that allows for the realist propositions of science and gives them logical legitimacy, thus bridging the gap between philosophy and science â€“ but in so doing, Meillassoux renders problematic the static nature of physical laws and of scientific knowledge generally. For certain structural reasons (that canâ€™t be explored here), he proposes that the true state of the â€˜in-itselfâ€™ is that of absolutely contingency: what he calls â€˜hyper-chaos.â€™ He means this in its truly radical stance: â€œEverything could actually collapse: from trees to stars, from stars to laws, from physical laws to logical laws; and this not by virtue of some superior law whereby everything is destined to perish, but by virtue of the absence of any superior law capable of preserving anything, no matter what, from perishingâ€ (Meillassoux, p. 53). Any object that â€˜is,â€™ in-itself, isnâ€™t essential. It could cease to exist, for reasons contrary to scientific reason. For Meillassoux, the only thing that is necessary is that things arenâ€™t necessary; the only thing that isn't contingent is absolute contingency itself. He's able to recover the ability to think scientific statements in all their realism, but at the cost of any sort of static, absolute description of the world. His philosophy undermines the very glory of objects: they're no longer essential; they could be wiped away by the hyper-chaos of reality at any moment. If this is the first slight to the glory of objects, then Harman provides the second. * * * Harmanâ€™s philosophy, by contrast, isnâ€™t preoccupied with the recent history of continental discipline (at least to the degree Meillassoux is), nor with the legitimacy of scientific, â€˜ancestralâ€™ statements, but instead with trying to figure out the ontological (in Heideggerâ€™s sense) status of objects within the noumenal realm. He wants to think objects on their own level. He takes what he sees to be Heideggerâ€™s fundamental philosophical idea â€“ that being is necessarily non-presence â€“ to try and figure out what objects are like in their â€˜subterraneanâ€™ realm â€“ or, as he puts it: Instead of thinking extra-mental reality is founded on what appears to consciousness, we must j",2016,
GRAM: A generalized model to predict the molecular effect of a non-coding variant in a cell-type specific manner,"There has been much effort to prioritize genomic variants with respect to their impact on â€œfunctionâ€. However, function is often not precisely defined: Sometimes, it is the disease association of a variant; other times, it reflects a molecular effect on transcription or epigenetics. Here we coupled multiple genomic predictors to build GRAM, a generalized model, to predict a well-defined experimental target: the expression-modulating effect of a non-coding variant in a cell-specific manner. As a first step, we performed feature engineering: using a LASSO regularized linear model, we found transcription factor (TF) binding most predictive, especially for TFs that are hubs in the regulatory network; in contrast, evolutionary conservation, a popular feature in many other functional-impact predictors, has almost no contribution. Moreover, TF binding inferred from in vitro SELEX is as effective as that from in vivo ChIP-Seq. Second, we implemented GRAM integrating SELEX features and expression profiles. The program combines a universal regulatory score for a variant in a non-coding element with a modifier score reflecting the particular cell type. We benchmarked GRAM on a large-scale MPRA dataset in the GM12878 cell line, achieving a ROC score of ~0.73; performance on the K562 cell line was similar. Finally, we evaluated the performance of GRAM on targeted regions using luciferase assays in MCF7 and K562 cell lines. We noted that changing the insertion position of the construct relative to the reporter gene gives very different results, highlighting the importance of carefully defining the functional target the model is predicting. Author Summary Noncoding variants lie outside of protein-coding regions, and are found to have disease associations. However, knowledge on the molecular effect of these non-coding variants in a cell-specific context is very limited. Also, different output between multiple experiment platforms may introduce extra complexity in analyzing the molecular function of these variants. We developed GRAM, a generalized model to predict molecular effect of non-coding variants in multiple cell types for different experimental platforms. We first selected the most informative cell-independent SELEX transcription factor binding score on the variant locus as features and then combine cell-specific gene expression profile to build a multi-step prediction model. GRAM has been successfully tested on both MPRA and Luciferase assay, and on three different cell lines: GM12878, K562 and MCF7, shows high performance.",2018,bioRxiv
An equivalent condition for continuous maps of a class of continua to have zero topological entropy,"Extending the famous Bowen-Franks-Misiurewicz's the- orem concerning the topological entropy of continuous maps of an intervalwe prove that continuous maps of a classof continua have zero topological entropy if and only if the periods of allperiodic points are powers of 2. All maps considered in thispaper are continuous. According to the well- known Bowen-Franks-Misiurewicz's theorem, a map of theunitintervalhas zero topological entropy ifand only iftheperiods of allperiodic pointsof themap are powers of 2. In (12),the authors shown that the above resultis stilltrue when replacing the unitintervalby a Warsaw circle.Since Sarkovskii's theorem holds for maps of a hereditarilydecomposable chainable continuum (HDCC) (3),itis natural to ask whether Bowen-Franks-Misiurewicz's theorem can be extended to maps of thiskind of continua. In thispaper, we show that maps of a class of HDCC have zero topological entropy if and only if the periods of allperiodic points are powers of 2. To be more precise we introduce some notations.

Genetic diversity and trait genomic prediction in a pea diversity panel,"BackgroundPea (Pisum sativum L.), a major pulse crop grown for its protein-rich seeds, is an important component of agroecological cropping systems in diverse regions of the world. New breeding challenges imposed by global climate change and new regulations urge pea breeders to undertake more efficient methods of selection and better take advantage of the large genetic diversity present in the Pisum sativum genepool. Diversity studies conducted so far in pea used Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) and Retrotransposon Based Insertion Polymorphism (RBIP) markers. Recently, SNP marker panels have been developed that will be useful for genetic diversity assessment and marker-assisted selection.ResultsA collection of diverse pea accessions, including landraces and cultivars of garden, field or fodder peas as well as wild peas was characterised at the molecular level using newly developed SNP markers, as well as SSR markers and RBIP markers. The three types of markers were used to describe the structure of the collection and revealed different pictures of the genetic diversity among the collection. SSR showed the fastest rate of evolution and RBIP the slowest rate of evolution, pointing to their contrasted mode of evolution. SNP markers were then used to predict phenotypes -the date of flowering (BegFlo), the number of seeds per plant (Nseed) and thousand seed weight (TSW)- that were recorded for the collection. Different statistical methods were tested including the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage ans Selection Operator), PLS (Partial Least Squares), SPLS (Sparse Partial Least Squares), Bayes A, Bayes B and GBLUP (Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) methods and the structure of the collection was taken into account in the prediction. Despite a limited number of 331 markers used for prediction, TSW was reliably predicted.ConclusionThe development of marker assisted selection has not reached its full potential in pea until now. This paper shows that the high-throughput SNP arrays that are being developed will most probably allow for a more efficient selection in this species.",2015,BMC Genomics
Influence of Steroid Treatment during Neonatal Life on Sexual Maturation,"In adult animals treatment with androgenic or oestrogenic hormones results in a temporary suppression of fertility after which there is a return to normal reproductive function. A different response, however, is seen in animals treated shortly after birth. Administration of steroid hormones within the first few days of life results in permanent sterility: a single subcutaneous injection of testosterone propionate given to female mice (Barraclough & Leathem 1954) or rats (Barraclough 1961) within ten days of birth produces in the adult animals failure to form corpora lutea and constantly cornified vaginal epithelium. Administration of cestradiol benzoate to neonatal males under similar conditions will evoke irreversible changes manifested by azospermia and decreased testicular androgen production (Kincl et al. 1963). Female animals may be also permanently sterilized by various oestrogens, whereas males are insensitive to androgen treatment (Kincl, Folch Pi, Maqueo, Herrera Lasso, Oriol & Dorfman 1965). Table 1 shows the effect seen at autopsy at the age of 45 days following several phenolic steroids given in a single injection to 5-day-old rats. In males the effect was judged on the basis of testicular and accessory sex tissue atrophy and on histological evaluation (Maqueo & Kincl 1964). In females the presence or absence of corpora lutea was the main index used. These data demonstrate that the activity of phenolic steroids in the neonatal rats is independent of their oestrogenic activity, as determined by uterine weight increase in the immature mouse assay (Rubin et al. 1951), and constitutes",1966,Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine
Neurologische Aspekte bei chronischer Herzinsuffizienz,"ZusammenfassungDie chronische Herzinsuffizienz (CHI) gehÃ¶rt zu den hÃ¤ufigsten internistischen Erkrankungen und ist mit einer hohen MorbiditÃ¤t und LetalitÃ¤t assoziiert. Patienten mit CHI weisen eine hohe neurologische KomorbiditÃ¤t mit einem erhÃ¶hten Risiko fÃ¼r ischÃ¤mische Hirninfarkte, kognitive Defizite, degenerative VerÃ¤nderungen des zentralen Nervensystems und ein Schlafapnoesyndrom auf. Das relative Schlaganfallrisiko ist bei bestehender Herzinsuffizienz (HI) etwa 2- bis 3fach erhÃ¶ht und nimmt mit zunehmendem Alter, bei arterieller Hypertonie und insbesondere bei begleitendem Vorhofflimmern zu. DarÃ¼ber hinaus ist bei HI die schlaganfallassoziierte Sterblichkeit und das Risiko fÃ¼r eine persistierende schwere Behinderung mehr als verdoppelt. Bei 25â€“80% der CHI-Patienten werden zudem kognitive Defizite beschrieben, welche durch Aufmerksamkeits-, MerkfÃ¤higkeits- und KonzentrationsstÃ¶rungen, eine verminderte psychomotorische Geschwindigkeit und exekutive FunktionsstÃ¶rungen charakterisiert sind. Als mÃ¶gliche Ursachen werden die bei CHI nachgewiesene kortikale Atrophie, die verminderte zerebrale Perfusion, eine gestÃ¶rte zerebrale Autoregulation und ischÃ¤mische Hirninfarkte angesehen. Das Risiko fÃ¼r eine Demenz ist bei CHI in etwa verdoppelt. Zudem ist von einer erhÃ¶hten LetalitÃ¤t bei kognitiven Defiziten auszugehen. Ebenso mit einer schlechten Prognose assoziiert ist das bei weit Ã¼ber der HÃ¤lfte aller Patienten mit reduzierter Ejektionsfraktion (EF) nachweisbare, zumeist zentral bedingte Schlafapnoesyndrom. Prospektive klinische Studien mÃ¼ssen allerdings erst nachweisen, ob eine frÃ¼hzeitige und optimierte Therapie der CHI die assoziierten neurologischen und neuropsychologischen FolgeschÃ¤den tatsÃ¤chlich reduzieren kann.SummaryChronic heart failure (CHF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality. Moreover, there is a high rate of neurological as well as neuropsychological comorbidities, namely ischemic stroke, structural brain alterations, cognitive impairment, sleep apnea and possible side-effects of HF medication such as delirium or (intracerebral) hemorrhage. The higher stroke risk in patients with HF increases further with age, concomitant arterial hypertension or atrial fibrillation (AF). In women the stroke risk increases with reduced ejection fraction (EF). In general stroke in HF patients is associated with a poor outcome and higher mortality, which is increased more than 2-fold. Furthermore, approximately 25-80% of all patients with CHF experience cognitive impairments such as decreased attention and concentration, memory loss, diminished psychomotor reaction time and decreased executive functions. Cognitive impairment in patients with HF has been linked to losses in gray matter, (silent) ischemic strokes, decreased cerebral perfusion and higher mortality. Moreover, sleep apnea occurs in more than half of all patients with CHF and reduced EF. However, prospective studies are needed to test whether early detection and optimal treatment of HF reduces the burden of neurological and neuropsychological sequelae.",2010,Der Nervenarzt
A group bridge approach for variable selection.,"In multiple regression problems when covariates can be naturally grouped, it is important to carry out feature selection at the group and within-group individual variable levels simultaneously. The existing methods, including the lasso and group lasso, are designed for either variable selection or group selection, but not for both. We propose a group bridge approach that is capable of simultaneous selection at both the group and within-group individual variable levels. The proposed approach is a penalized regularization method that uses a specially designed group bridge penalty. It has the oracle group selection property, in that it can correctly select important groups with probability converging to one. In contrast, the group lasso and group least angle regression methods in general do not possess such an oracle property in group selection. Simulation studies indicate that the group bridge has superior performance in group and individual variable selection relative to several existing methods.",2009,Biometrika
A pH-Sensitive Peptide-Containing Lasso Molecular Switch,"The synthesis of a peptide-containing lasso molecular switch by a self-entanglement strategy is described. The interlocked rotaxane molecular machine consists of a benzometaphenylene[25]crown-8 (BMP25C8) macrocycle surrounding a molecular axle. This molecular axle contains a tripeptidic sequence and two molecular stations: a N-benzyltriazolium and a pH-sensitive anilinium station. The tripeptide is located between the macrocycle and the triazolium station, so that its conformation can be tailored depending on the shuttling of the macrocycle from one station to the other. At acidic pH, the macrocycle resides around the anilinium moiety, whereas it shuttles around the triazolium station after deprotonation. This molecular machinery thus forces the lasso to adopt a tightened or a loosened conformation.",2013,Molecules
The Generalized Lasso for Sub-Gaussian Measurements With Dithered Quantization,"In the problem of structured signal recovery from high-dimensional linear observations, it is commonly assumed that full-precision measurements are available. Under this assumption, the recovery performance of the popular Generalized Lasso (G-Lasso) is by now well-established. In this paper, we extend these types of results to the practically relevant settings with quantized measurements. We study two extremes of the quantization schemes, namely, uniform and one-bit quantization; the former imposes no limit on the number of quantization bits, while the second only allows for one bit. In the presence of a uniform dithering signal and when measurement vectors are sub-gaussian, we show that the same algorithm (i.e., the G-Lasso) has favorable recovery guarantees for both uniform and one-bit quantization schemes. Our theoretical results, shed light on the appropriate choice of the range of values of the dithering signal and accurately capture the error dependence on the problem parameters. For example, our error analysis shows that the G-Lasso with one-bit uniformly dithered measurements leads to only a logarithmic rate loss compared to the full-precision measurements.",2020,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
"Palynological Study of Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous Sediments, Site 511, Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 71 (Falkland Plateau)","Samples from Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous sediments at Site 511 were analyzed for palynomorphs. Three palynological assemblages were identified: Upper Jurassic (presumably Tithonian), Neocomian-Aptian, and lower Albian. These were correlated to synchronous assemblages in Argentina, South Africa, and Australia and were compared with Jurassic palynoassemblages from Hole 330, Leg 36. INTRODUCTION At Site 511, on the Falkland Plateau (western part of the Maurice Ewing Bank), Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous sediments were penetrated by Hole 511, drilled to a depth of 632 meters some 10 km from Site 330 (Leg 36). Within the Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous interval, two lithological units (Units 5 and Unit 6) were identified. The upper unit (Unit 5) is composed of calcareous claystones. Their oxidation state did not favor the preservation of organic matter: the sediments contain no spores, pollen, dinoflagellate cysts, or plant detritus. The lower unit (Unit 6) is composed of black shales containing 1.7-4.1% organic carbon. In this unit, only 47 of all samples taken contained spores, pollen, dinoflagellate cysts, and great amounts of plant detritus. The samples were treated with hydrochloric acid, potassium sodium hydroxide, hydrofluoric acid, and cadmium liquid. The results of the palynological analysis are summarized in Table 1, which shows the percentage of spores and pollen. Figure 1 shows the stratigraphic distribution of the most characteristic species and genera. Photographs in Plates 1-15 were made with a Biolam microscope and a MNF-12 microphotographic device. DISTRIBUTION OF SPORES AND POLLEN IN UPPER JURASSIC AND LOWER CRETACEOUS SEDIMENTS AT SITE 511; AGE OF PALYNOASSEMBLAGES Organic remains of plant origin in the interval between 498 and 632 meters (Unit 6, Cores 70-56) consisted of plant detritus, spores, pollen, and dinoflagellate cysts. The last were not examined in this study. Plant detritus in Cores 70-59 is in the form of amorphous sapropelic material and fragments of cuticles and tracheids belonging to terrestrial plants. The distribution of pollen and spores in this interval is variable. They are abundant in Cores 70-68 and 63-60 but not numerous in Cores 6764 and 59. In some samples from the uppermost parts of Ludwig, W. J., Krasheninnikov, V. A., et al., Init. Repts. DSDP, 71: Washington (U.S. Govt. Printing Office). this interval (Cores 63, 61, 59), amorphous detritus is coagulated into rounded yellow brown aggregates with an admixture of pyrite. Traces of pyrite are seen on the surfaces of spores and pollen. The available sapropelic material enables us to assume that black shales in this interval were formed under anaerobic conditions. The uneven distribution of pollen and spores suggests an alternation of anaerobic conditions with slightly oxidizing environments. However, low abundances of spores can be due to unfavorable climatic conditions for ferns on the nearby land. Amorphous sapropelic material disappears at the beginning of Core 58. In Sample 511-58-3, 53-55 cm, the plant detritus consists of large, bright orange, cuticular remains. The content and diversity of fern spores sharply increase. From Sample 511-58-2, 142-144 cm to Sample 511-56-4, 142144 cm the plant detritus contains fragments of middlesized cuticles and tracheids, brown to black in color, with an admixture of crushed micrinitic material. Disappearance of sapropelic material may denote the beginning of oxidizing processes, and the admixture of micrinitic material may suggest a certain remoteness from a source area. Diverse and numerous fern spores lead us to assume that climatic conditions for the existence of ferns were favorable on the nearby land. The palynological analysis allowed us to distinguish three assemblages within the interval from 495 to 632 meters. Assemblage I Assemblage I was identified in the interval from 632 to 555 meters (Cores 70-63). Of 31 samples analyzed, 18 contained spores and pollen. The assemblage abounds in gymnosperm pollen in which Classopollis predominates (45.5-78%) and Vitreisporites pallidus (7.5-38%) is abundant. Bisaccate and trisaccate conifer pollen and pollen of the genus Callialasporites (C. dampieri, C. trilobatus, C. turbatus, C. segmentatus) are always present. Less frequent is monosaccate conifer pollen (Monosaccites sp. 1), Sulcosaccispora sp., and Araucariacites australis. Spores are not numerous (2.0-8%) and are represented mostly by Antulsporites saevus, A. varigranulatus, Converrucosi-",1983,
"Lâ€™eruzione del vulcano Tambora nel 1815: le conseguenze sul clima, lâ€™ambiente e lâ€™uomo","Lâ€™eruzione nel 1815 del vulcano Tambora, in Indonesia, che espulse 140 gt di magma (â‰ˆ50 km3 di roccia densa equivalente, DRE), fu la piu grande eruzione della storia. Piu del 95% delle emissioni consistette in flussi piroclastici, ma il 40% della massa del materiale di questi ultimi risulto essere una caduta di ceneri dalle nubi di tipo Phoenix sprigionatesi dai flussi mentre si depositavano, che contribuirono solo in misura ridotta alla magnitudo totale dellâ€™eruzione. Tuttavia, le brevi esplosioni pliniane che precedettero lâ€™eruzione critica e il collasso della caldera furono potenti, e spinsero le colonne fino a 43 km di altitudine. Piu di 61.000 persone morirono durante o immediatamente dopo lâ€™eruzione, a Sumbawa e nella vicina isola di Lombok. Lâ€™eruzione emise â‰ˆ60 m di zolfo nella stratosfera, una quantita sei volte superiore a quella rilasciata dallâ€™eruzione del Pinatubo nel 1991. Cio diede luogo a un velo di aerosol di solfati nella stratosfera, che si tradusse in significative perturbazioni del clima. Lâ€™anno seguente, un freddo anomalo colpi le regioni nordorientali degli Usa, quelle canadesi che si affacciano sullâ€™Atlantico e lâ€™Europa. Da allora il 1816, in queste zone, e noto come ""lâ€™anno senza estate"". I raccolti fallirono quasi ovunque e si e chiamata in causa lâ€™eruzione per spiegare lâ€™accelerazione dellâ€™emigrazione dal New England e il diffuso insorgere di epidemie di tifo. Questi fenomeni forniscono elementi di conoscenza fondamentali circa le trasformazioni climatiche indotte dallâ€™attivita vulcanica e il rischio globale connesso a eruzioni vulcaniche di queste dimensioni. The 1815 eruption of Tambora volcano (Sumbawa island, Indonesia) expelled around 140 gt of magma (equivalent to â‰ˆ50 km3 of dense rock), making it the largest known historic eruption. More than 95% by mass of the ejecta was erupted as pyroclastic flows, but 40% by mass of the material in these flows ended up as ash fallout from the ""Phoenix"" clouds that lofted above the flows during their emplacement. Although they made only a minor contribution to the total magnitude of the eruption, the short-lived plinian explosions that preceded the climactic eruption and caldera collapse were powerful, propelling plumes up to 43 km altitude. Over 61.000 people died during, or in the aftermath of, the eruption, on Sumbawa and the neighbouring island of Lombok. The eruption injected â‰ˆ60 m of sulfur into the stratosphere, six times more than was released by the 1991 Pinatubo eruption. This formed a global sulfate aerosol veil in the stratosphere, which resulted in pronounced climate perturbations. Anomalously cold weather hit the northeastern Usa, maritime provinces of Canada, and Europe the following year. 1816 came to be known as the ""Year without a summer"" in these regions. Crop failures were widespread and the eruption has been implicated in accelerated emigration from New England, and widespread outbreaks of epidemic typhus. These events provide important insights into the volcanic forcing of climate, and the global risk of future eruptions on this scale.",2017,
Accumulation of Wall-Associated Peroxidases during Wound-Induced Suberization of Flax,"Summary Flax plants deposit ligno-suberin material around wounds. The deposition of this material is first detected histochemically at 3â€“4 days after wounding. Preceding this, at 2 days after wounding, the levels of ionically bound and covalently bound but Driselase-solubilized wall peroxidase activity are approximately four-fold higher than the control samples from unwounded tissue. Although this increase in wallassociated peroxidase activity is accompanied by an increase in the ability of the wall-associated enzymes to oxidize reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NADH) to form hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), the ratio of NADH oxidase to peroxidase activities is lower than the unwounded control samples. These figures suggest that wounding does not result in the accumulation of wall-associated peroxidases that have a particular affinity for the generation of H 2 O 2 . It is intriguing, therefore, that cell wall preparations from wounded tissue at 2 days have gained the ability to oxidize peroxidase substrates in the absence of added H 2 O 2 . This suggests that these preparations can either generate their own H 2 O 2 or contain covalently bound wall oxidases. An examination of peroxidase isozymes present in the wall-associated fractions suggests that the wound healing process is accompanied by increases in the abundance of specific cationic and anionic isozymes. Some of the cationic peroxidases isozymes can also oxidise peroxidase substrates in the absence of H 2 O 2 . The significance of the production of these oxidase/peroxidase isozymes during wound healing is discussed.",1993,Journal of Plant Physiology
Asymptotic properties of Lasso in high-dimensional partially linear models,"We study the properties of the Lasso in the high-dimensional partially linear model where the number of variables in the linear part can be greater than the sample size. We use truncated series expansion based on polynomial splines to approximate the nonparametric component in this model. Under a sparsity assumption on the regression coefficients of the linear component and some regularity conditions, we derive the oracle inequalities for the prediction risk and the estimation error. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the Lasso estimator is selection consistent for the variables in the linear part of the model. In addition, we derive the rate of convergence of the estimator of the nonparametric function. We conduct simulation studies to evaluate the finite sample performance of variable selection and nonparametric function estimation.",2016,Science China Mathematics
Alternating Group Lasso for Block-Term Tensor Decomposition and Application to ECG Source Separation,"In some applications, blind source separation can be performed by computing an approximate block-term tensor decomposition (BTD), under much milder constraints than matrix-based techniques. However, choosing the BTD model structure (i.e., the number of blocks and their ranks) is a difficult problem, and the standard least-squares formulation can be ill-posed. This paper proposes an alternating group lasso algorithm to compute approximate low-rank BTDs. It solves, in a provably convergent manner, a well-posed mixed-norm regularized tensor approximation problem that allows estimating the model parameters and its structure jointly. A variant is also put forward for dealing with linearly constrained blocks, motivated by the problem of blind separation of sums of complex exponentials, which can be cast as a low-rank Hankel-structured block-term tensor approximation problem. An experimental comparison with a standard nonlinear least-squares algorithm on synthetic tensor data indicates that the proposed algorithm is much more robust with respect to initialization. We also apply the constrained variant to the extraction of atrial activity from semi-synthetic and real-world electrocardiogram recordings during atrial fibrillation episodes. Our results show its ability to consistently select an adequate structure and to extract multiple signals which can be physiologically interpreted as atrial fibrillation patterns.",2020,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
A predictive model of revenue per available room in the Eastern Mediterranean using bilateral exchange rates,"In an era of exchange rate volatility, performance of hospitality industry assets may be highly sensitive to currency shocks which affect international demand, such as the fall in the value of the Russian Ruble in late 2014. We aim to create a systematic and meaningful predictive model to give insight for managers and investors in the hospitality industry in this region regarding which bilateral exchange rates to watch most closely and particularly the timing of anticipated effects. This study will examine the relationship between Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), the key measure of operational performance in the hospitality industry, and bilateral exchange rates in eight countries of the Balkans and Eastern Mediterranean.

Restricted LASSO and Double Shrinking,"In the context of multiple regression model, suppose that the vector parameter of interest \beta is subjected to lie in the subspace hypothesis H\beta = h, where this restriction is based on either additional information or prior knowledge. Then, the restricted estimator performs fairly well than the ordinary least squares one. In addition, when the number of variables is relatively large with respect to observations, the use of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) estimator is suggested for variable selection purposes. In this paper, we deffine a restricted LASSO estimator and configure three classes of LASSO-type estimators to fulfill both variable selection and restricted estimation. Asymptotic performance of the proposed estimators are studied and a simulation is conducted to analyze asymptotic relative efficiencies. The application of our result is considered for the prostate dataset where the expected prediction errors and risks are compared. It has been shown that the proposed shrunken LASSO estimators, resulted from double shrinking methodology, perform better than the classical LASSO.",2015,arXiv: Statistics Theory
"Seagrasses of Tongsha Island, with descriptions of four new records to Taiwan","The composition, abundance, and distribution of seagrasses on Tongsha island were studied from 21 to 29 April 2004. A total of seven seagrass species from six genera and two families were identified. Among them, four species were new to Taiwan, including Cymodocea rotundata Ehrenb. et Hempr. ex Aschers., Cymodocea serrulata (R. Br.) Aschers. and Magnus, Syringodium isoetifolium (Aschers.) Dandy, and Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forsk.) den Hartog. The species number of seagrasses was 14% of the total global number. The total coverage area of the seagrass beds was estimated to be 8.2 km^2 distributed around Tongsha island and the lagoon. Mean percentage cover and shoot density were high, ranging from 20 to 95% and ï¼œ1250 to ï¼ž2500 shoots m^(-2), respectively. The large area of the seagrass bed, the high shoot density and coverage of seagrasses, and the diverse species of Tongsha island indicate that the seagrass resource on Tungsha island is very abundant. These seagrass beds must be conserved to ensure the sustainable management of Tongsha Island.",2005,Botanical Bulletin of Academia Sinica

Prehistoric Archaeology Underwater: A Nascent Subdiscipline Critical to Understanding Early Coastal Occupations and Migration Routes,"Awareness of and interest in the role that coastlines and coastal adaptations played in the development and dispersal of anatomically modern humans have grown over the last few decades. Scattered evidence for marine exploitation between 125,000 and 12,000 cal BP has been identified in Africa (Henshilwood et al. 2001; Singer and Wymer 1982; Walter et al. 2000), Eurasia (Stiner 1999; Straus et al. 1993), and North America (Erlandson et al. 1996). Yet, robust archaeological evidence for coastal activities accrues worldwide predominantly after 10,000 cal BP (Des Lauriers 2005; Dixon et al. 1997; Dunbar 1997; Erlandson 2002; Glassow et al. 2008; Jacobsen 1973; Keefer et al. 1998; Sandweiss et al. 1998; Stothert 1985). This relatively late appearance of clear-cut evidence for early coastal exploitation has been used to propose that early humans had little interest in coasts until stressed to seek less productive resources (Yesner 1987). Conversely, many researchers argue that the paucity of identified coastal sites dating to earlier times is more likely a result of our inability to locate these sites, rather than a lack of interest in coasts and coastal resources by early humans (Dixon 2001; Erlandson 2001; Kraft et al. 1983). Numerous Pleistocene age coastlines were deeply submerged during the postglacial period of eustatic sea level rise; and in areas such as the Northwest Coast of North America, isotastic rebound outpaced sea level rise, leaving Pleistocene coastal landscapes miles inland from current shorelines. These factors conspire to make locating Pleistocene landscapes difficult, and identifying preserved sites on those landscapes, a challenge.",2011,
Performance appraisal: the legal implications of Title VII.,"Since the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and specifically Title VII of the Act, the federal government has increasingly involved itself with personnel policies and practices of employers in both the public and the private sector. While Title VII was initially directed toward discriminatory employee selection practices, the development of case law in this area suggests that the courts are now interpreting the Act much more broadly. In light of this, human resources managers would be wise to reevaluate the adequacy of existing performance appraisal systems to make them defensible against charges of discriminatory employment practices. After examining significant cases brought before the courts involving performance appraisal systems, authors Gary L. Lubben, Duane E. Thompson, and Charles R. Klasson draw conclusions as to what would constitute a defensible appraisal system. Chief among these is to make the overall appraisal process as formal, standard, and objective as possible and to consider subjective supervisory ratings as only one component of the overall evaluation process.",1980,Personnel
"In vitro sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to halofantrine compared with chloroquine, quinine and mefloquine in the region of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso (West Africa).","The in vitro sensitivity of P. falciparum drug-resistant isolates was evaluated in the region of Bobo-Dioulasso during the 1995 and 1996 rainy seasons.

The proportion of chloroquine-resistant isolates was 20% in 1995 and 19% in 1996, whilst in 1996, the proportion of isolates resistant to halofantrine was greater than in 1995 (9.6% versus 1%). No significant differences were seen in the mean IC50 values in relation to the susceptibility of chloroquine-resistant or chloroquine-sensitive isolates to mefloquine and halofantrine. In the case of quinine, the mean IC50 values were significantly higher in chloroquine-resistant isolates than in chloroquine-sensitive ones.

New simplified technique for 3D mapping and ablation of right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia.,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of using a circular multielectrode catheter for mapping and ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT).


BACKGROUND
Three-dimensional (3D) mapping systems are commonly used for mapping and ablation of RVOT VT and PVCs. Newer catheters that are circular with multiple electrodes, such as the Lasso catheter, are capable of simultaneously recording from multiple points within a circumferential plane. Given the tubular structure of the RVOT, these catheters could be used for mapping tachycardias from the RVOT.


METHODS
A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing radiofrequency (RF) ablation of RVOT VT or PVCs was performed. In group 1 (n = 7), mapping was performed with a single ablation catheter and fluoroscopy. In group 2 (n = 10), 3D mapping using ESI (n = 9) or CARTO (n = 1) was performed. In group 3 (n = 12), mapping was performed with a circular multielectrode catheter (n = 12). All ablations were performed with 4-mm tip catheters using RF energy.


RESULTS
Catheter ablation for RVOT VT (n = 15) or PVCs (n = 14) was performed on 29 cases in 26 patients, 9 males. Mean age was 35.9 years. In groups 1, 2, and 3, the mean number of lesions was 17.7 +/- 7.7, 13.6 +/- 7.7, and 18.2 +/- 22.7 and the median number of lesions was 20, 13, and 5, respectively. There were no significant differences in the number of lesions, RF time, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, and acute success rate among the three techniques. There were three complications in group 2 and one in group 3.


CONCLUSION
The use of a circular multielectrode catheter is as effective as the other standard available 3D mapping techniques, both in terms of procedural success and procedural characteristics. Additionally, because of the lower cost associated with using the circular multielectrode catheter approach, further evaluation should be performed to determine whether this is the most cost-effective approach to 3D mapping and ablation of RVOT tachycardias.",2005,Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE
The feasibility study of pulping and papermaking with hybridized Chinese pennisetum,"The chemical composition, fibre morphology and feasibility of pulping and papermaking of hybridized Chinese pennisetum was studied in a research trial.

Stable Feature Selection from Brain sMRI,"Neuroimage analysis usually involves learning thousands or even millions of variables using only a limited number of samples. In this regard, sparse models, e.g. the lasso, are applied to select the optimal features and achieve high diagnosis accuracy. The lasso, however, usually results in independent unstable features. Stability, a manifest of reproducibility of statistical results subject to reasonable perturbations to data and the model (Yu 2013), is an important focus in statistics, especially in the analysis of high dimensional data. In this paper, we explore a nonnegative generalized fused lasso model for stable feature selection in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to sparsity, our model incorporates two important pathological priors: the spatial cohesion of lesion voxels and the positive correlation between the features and the disease labels. To optimize the model, we propose an efficient algorithm by proving a novel link between total variation and fast network flow algorithms via conic duality. Experiments show that the proposed nonnegative model performs much better in exploring the intrinsic structure of data via selecting stable features compared with other state-of-the-arts.",2015,
Alcohol-associated osteonecrosis of the femoral head with subsequent development in the contralateral hip: A report of two cases.,"Although the pathogenesis of non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) has not been clarified, high-dose oral corticosteroid therapy and heavy consumption of alcohol have been associated with its occurrence [1e3]. Epidemiological surveys in Japan have found that 34% of ONFH patients have a history of heavy alcohol consumption [1]. The necrotic area of ONFH is determinedwhen it occurs, and the possibility of necrotic area extension is extremely low even if the patient continues taking oral corticosteroids or consuming large quantities of alcohol. The probability of ONFH occurring in both femoral heads is 50e80% [4], with bilateral ONFH thought to occur at almost the same time. Patients with unilateral ONFH rarely develop new ONFH in the contralateral hip. To our knowledge, only two previous case reports have described the occurrence of new ONFH in the contralateral hip: one with alcohol associated ONFH [5] and the other accompanying an increased dosage of corticosteroid [6]. This report describes two patients with alcoholassociated ONFH who developed ONFH of the contralateral hip following treatment of the first side. The patients and their families were informed that data from the cases would be submitted for publication, and gave their consent.",2016,Journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association
Compliance of Computed Tomography Scan Requests in Sub-Saharan Africa,">Objective: To investigate the compliance of computed tomography (CT) scan 
requests in the X-ray units of Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Multi-centric, 
exhaustive, descriptive and cross-sectional study (Burkina Faso and Benin) focused 
on CT scan requests implemented and interpreted from May 1 to July 31, 2014. 
Request compliance was assessed according to the criteria of the French High 
Authority for Health to which was added a criterion for fulfillment of 
description of patient clinical information. An exam was deemed compliant when 
all criteria were met. Ratios were compared by means of Chi2 test at 
0.05% significance level. Results: Among the 426 colligated computed tomography 
prescriptions, the least filled fields were allergy concept (0%), creatinine-mia 
(0.3%), examination purpose (50.2%). The overall compliance rate was 35%. The 
requests made by medical specialists were more compliant than those made by 
general practitioners and students (p = 0.003). Fulfillment of clinical 
information description was also better among medical specialists compared to 
the other prescribers (p = 0.002). Conclusion: It is important to improve the 
quality of computed tomography (CT) scan requests in the hospitals of 
Bobo-Dioulasso (Bur-kina Faso) and Parakou (Benin).",2016,Open Journal of Radiology
Coping with the Environment: How Microbes Survive Environmental Challenges,"Microorganisms are exposed to constantly changing environments in their natural habitats either in planktonic form or microbial communities. Examples of these environmental changes encompass nutrient limitation, temperature, pH, and osmolarity fluctuations, radiation, and other harmful agents, such as excessive amount of superoxides and heavy metals. To respond and adapt to adverse environmental changes, microorganisms employ a striking combination of transcriptional regulatory circuits to sense and translate extracellular stimuli into specific cellular signals, resulting in altered gene expression and protein activities. Investigation of these underlying mechanisms and strategies could improve our understanding of microbial physiology in general and potentially lead to discoveries of practical value in the field of health care and environment protection. In this special issue, we have invited a few papers that explore this topic from various perspectives. 
 
The first paper â€œExposure to glycolytic carbon sources reveals a novel layer of regulation for the MalT regulonâ€ presents the study on a synthetic lethal mutant ompR malTcon of Escherichia coli in which the constitutively expressed maltose system regulator MalT in its active form causes cell death in the absence of the osmoregulator OmpR. The authors propose that glycolysis provides a new layer of regulation to the maltose system on the basis that addition of glycolytic carbon sources promotes viability of the mutant. 
 
The second paper â€œThe effect of sub-MIC Î²-lactam antibiotic exposure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from people with cystic fibrosis in a desiccation survival modelâ€ examines resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to desiccation, which is an important environmental factor to the loss of viability of cells. Strains with a mucoid phenotype exhibit significantly improved desiccation survival when compared with nonmucoid ones, but effects of preincubation with sub-MIC beta-lactam antibiotics on desiccation resistance appear to be agent specific. 
 
The third paper â€œDetection of bacterial endospores in soil by terbium fluorescenceâ€ of this special issue addresses the relationship of soil parameters (carbon-to-nitrogen ratio) on the occurrence of bacterial spores and distribution of spores in relation to sampling depth. The results demonstrate that the combination of microwave treatment of soil samples and measurement of terbium dipicolinate (DPA) photoluminescence is a rapid and reliable method for the assessment of bacterial spores. 
 
The fourth paper â€œThe sulfate-rich and extreme saline sediment of the ephemeral Tirez lagoon: a biotope for acetoclastic sulfate-reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaeaâ€ is on the composition of methanogenic archaea, sulfate-reducing and sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotes in the extreme athalassohaline and particularly sulfate-rich sediment of Tirez Lagoon. The occurrence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic and acetotrophic sulfate-reducing organisms and winter-summer community structures in Tirez sediment are analyzed by using the PCR-DGGE fingerprint technique for the functional adenosine-5â€²-phosphosulfate (aprA) and the methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) gene markers. 
 
The last paper â€œStress responses of Shewanellaâ€ of this special issue focuses on stress responses of Shewanella, a group of facultative anaerobes capable of respiring on an array of compounds. As important and potential microorganisms for bioremediation, stress responses of Shewanella have been subjected to an array of analyses, especially with high-throughput technologies such as whole-genome microarrays. This comprehensive review highlights the current understanding of mechanisms by which Shewanella survive and thrive within varied environments, as well as points out promising future research directions.

Statistically modeling I - V characteristics of CNT-FET with LASSO,"With the advent of internet of things (IOT), the need for studying new material and devices for various applications is increasing. Traditionally we build compact models for transistors on the basis of physics. But physical models are expensive and need a very long time to adjust for non-ideal effects. As the vision for the application of many novel devices is not certain or the manufacture process is not mature, deriving generalized accurate physical models for such devices is very strenuous, whereas statistical modeling is becoming a potential method because of its data oriented property and fast implementation. In this paper, one classical statistical regression method, LASSO, is used to model the I - V characteristics of CNT-FET and a pseudo-PMOS inverter simulation based on the trained model is implemented in Cadence. The normalized relative mean square prediction error of the trained model versus experiment sample data and the simulation results show that the model is acceptable for digital circuit static simulation. And such modeling methodology can extend to general devices.",2017,Journal of Semiconductors
Subset selection for vector autoregressive processes via adaptive Lasso,"Subset selection is a critical component of vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling. This paper proposes simple and hybrid subset selection procedures for VAR models via the adaptive Lasso. By a proper choice of tuning parameters, one can identify the correct subset and obtain the asymptotic normality of the nonzero parameters with probability tending to one. Simulation results show that for small samples, a particular hybrid procedure has the best performance in terms of prediction mean squared errors, estimation errors and subset selection accuracy under various settings. The proposed method is also applied to modeling the IS-LM data for illustration.",2010,Statistics & Probability Letters

Biosynthetic multitasking facilitates thalassospiramide structural diversity in marine bacteria.,"Thalassospiramides A and B are immunosuppressant cyclic lipopeptides first reported from the marine Î±-proteobacterium Thalassospira sp. CNJ-328. We describe here the discovery and characterization of an extended family of 14 new analogues from four Tistrella and Thalassospira isolates. These potent calpain 1 protease inhibitors belong to six structure classes in which the length and composition of the acylpeptide side chain varies extensively. Genomic sequence analysis of the thalassospiramide-producing microbes revealed related, genus-specific biosynthetic loci encoding hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthases consistent with thalassospiramide assembly. The bioinformatics analysis of the gene clusters suggests that structural diversity, which ranges from the 803.4 Da thalassospiramide C to the 1291.7 Da thalassospiramide F, results from a complex sequence of reactions involving amino acid substrate channeling and enzymatic multimodule skipping and iteration. Preliminary biochemical analysis of the N-terminal nonribosomal peptide synthetase module from the Thalassospira TtcA megasynthase supports a biosynthetic model in which in cis amino acid activation competes with in trans activation to increase the range of amino acid substrates incorporated at the N terminus.",2013,Journal of the American Chemical Society
A novel genomic selection method combining GBLUP and LASSO,"Abstract
Genetic prediction of quantitative traits is a critical task in plant and animal breeding. Genomic selection is an accurate and efficient method of estimating genetic merits by using high-density genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). In the framework of linear mixed models, we extended genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) by including additional quantitative trait locus (QTL) information that was extracted from high-throughput SNPs by using least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO). GBLUP was combined with three LASSO methodsâ€”standard LASSO (SLGBLUP), adaptive LASSO (ALGBLUP), and elastic net (ENGBLUP)â€”that were used for detecting QTLs, and these QTLs were fitted as fixed effects; the remaining SNPs were fitted using a realized genetic relationship matrix. Simulations performed under distinct scenarios revealed that (1) the prediction accuracy of SLGBLUP was the lowest; (2) the prediction accuracies of ALGBLUP and ENGBLUP were equivalent to or higher than that of GBLUP, except under scenarios in which the number of QTLs was large; and (3) the persistence of prediction accuracy over generations was strongest in the case of ENGBLUP. Building on the favorable computational characteristics of GBLUP, ENGBLUP enables robust modeling and efficient computation to be performed for genomic selection.",2015,Genetica
[Perihepatitis and HIV / AIDS infection. 13 cases at the Bobo-Dioulasso national hospital (Burkina Faso)],Perihepatitis or Fitz-Hugh syndrome peritonitis located in the right hypochondriasis (RH) is a relatively rare affectation. However the HIV/AIDS pandemic has brought about the emergence and re-emergence of disease-states either uncommon or formerly on the decline as well as the appearance of opportunistic illness. We report the results of a retrospective study conducted in the National Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina-Faso) between 1 June 1997 and 31 December 1999 in an effort to contribute to a wider vision of diseases associated with HIV/AIDS. We based our study on 130 laparoscopies carried out for unexplained pain linked to RH (with or without fever) as well as abdominal-pelvian or diffuse abdominal pain. Thirteen cases (11 women 2 men) of perihepatitis were diagnosed. The mean age for women and men was respectively 31.4 and 39.5. HIV serology was systematically carried out for all patients and in case of perihepatitis cultures were taken. All patients were infected with HIV and some presented signs of AIDS according to the WHO classification. In clinical terms a shalking pain for RH was noted for 5 patients abdominal sensitivity in 8 cases as well as gynaecological anomalies: cul-de-sac moving pain (4 cases) leuchorrea (3 cases) and mucosic vulvovaginitis (1 case). Paraclinical tests revealed a slight hepatic cytolysis for only 3 patients (1.5 N). 6 patients tested positive for Chlamydia trachomatis; the 7 others could not be tested but this aetiology was assumed for evaluating the efficacy of the treatment under study. The high frequency of perihepatitis in these patients all of whom were suffering from HIV/AIDS and its presence in the 2 male cases suggest that immunodepression is conducive to the appearance of this disease.

Periodicities in Solar Coronal Mass Ejections,"ABSTRACT Mid-term quasi-periodicities in solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during the mostrecent solar maximum cycle 23 are reported here for the ï¬rst time using the four-year data (February 5, 1999 to February 10, 2003) of the Large Angle SpectrometricCoronagraph (LASCO) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Inparallel, mid-term quasi-periodicities in solar X-ray ï¬‚ares (class >M5.0) from theGeosynchronous Operational Environment Satellites (GOES) and in daily averages ofAp index for geomagnetic disturbances from the World Data Center (WDC) at theInternationalAssociation for Geomagnetism andAeronomy (IAGA)are alsoexaminedfor the same four-year time span. By Fourier power spectral analyses, the CME dataappears to contain signiï¬cant power peaks at periods of âˆ¼ 358 Â± 38, âˆ¼ 272 Â± 26,âˆ¼ 196Â±13 days and so forth, while except for the âˆ¼ 259Â±24-day period, X-ray solarï¬‚ares of class >âˆ¼ M5.0 show the familiar Rieger-type quasi-periods at âˆ¼ 157 Â± 11,âˆ¼ 122Â± 5, âˆ¼ 98Â±3 days and shorter ones until âˆ¼ 34Â±0.5 days. In the data of dailyaverages of Ap index, the two signiï¬cant peaks at periods âˆ¼ 273Â±26 and âˆ¼ 187Â±12days (the latter is most prominent) could imply that CMEs (periods at âˆ¼ 272Â±26andâˆ¼ 196 Â± 13 days) may be proportionally correlated with quasi-periodic geomagneticstorm disturbances; at the speculative level, the âˆ¼ 138 Â± 6-day period might implythat X-ray ï¬‚ares of class >âˆ¼ M5.0 (period at âˆ¼ 157Â±11 days) may drive certain typesof geomagnetic disturbances; and the âˆ¼ 28Â±0.2-day periodicity is most likely causedby recurrent high-speed solar winds at the Earthâ€™s magnetosphere. For the same threedata sets, we further perform Morlet wavelet analysis to derive period-time contoursand identify wavelet power peaks and timescales at the 99 percent conï¬dence level forcomparisons. Several conceptual aspects of possible equatorially trapped Rossby-typewaves at and beneath the solar photosphere are discussed.Key words: oscillations â€” space weather â€” Sun: activities â€” corona â€” coronalmass ejections â€” magnetic ï¬elds",2003,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
Head-to-Head Comparison and Evaluation of 92 Plasma Protein Biomarkers for Early Detection of Colorectal Cancer in a True Screening Setting.,"PURPOSE
Novel noninvasive blood-based screening tests are strongly desirable for early detection of colorectal cancer. We aimed to conduct a head-to-head comparison of the diagnostic performance of 92 plasma-based tumor-associated protein biomarkers for early detection of colorectal cancer in a true screening setting.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Among all available 35 carriers of colorectal cancer and a representative sample of 54 men and women free of colorectal neoplasms recruited in a cohort of screening colonoscopy participants in 2005-2012 (N = 5,516), the plasma levels of 92 protein biomarkers were measured. ROC analyses were conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance. A multimarker algorithm was developed through the Lasso logistic regression model and validated in an independent validation set. The .632+ bootstrap method was used to adjust for the potential overestimation of diagnostic performance.


RESULTS
Seventeen protein markers were identified to show statistically significant differences in plasma levels between colorectal cancer cases and controls. The adjusted area under the ROC curves (AUC) of these 17 individual markers ranged from 0.55 to 0.70. An eight-marker classifier was constructed that increased the adjusted AUC to 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59-0.91]. When validating this algorithm in an independent validation set, the AUC was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.65-0.85), and sensitivities at cutoff levels yielding 80% and 90% specificities were 65% (95% CI, 41-80%) and 44% (95% CI, 24-72%), respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
The identified profile of protein biomarkers could contribute to the development of a powerful multimarker blood-based test for early detection of colorectal cancer.",2015,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research
Identifying the white matter impairments among ART-naÃ¯ve HIV patients: a multivariate pattern analysis of DTI data,"AbstractObjectiveTo identify the white matter (WM) impairments of the antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naÃ¯ve HIV patients by conducting a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) dataMethodsWe enrolled 33 ART-naÃ¯ve HIV patients and 32 Normal controls in the current study. Firstly, the DTI metrics in whole brain WM tracts were extracted for each subject and feed into the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operators procedure (LASSO)-Logistic regression model to identify the impaired WM tracts. Then, Support Vector Machines (SVM) model was constructed based on the DTI metrics in the impaired WM tracts to make HIV-control group classification. Pearson correlations between the WM impairments and HIV clinical statics were also investigated.ResultsExtensive HIV-related impairments were observed in the WM tracts associated with motor function, the corpus callosum (CC) and the frontal WM. With leave-one-out cross validation, accuracy of 83.08% (P=0.002) and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.9110 were obtained in the SVM classification model. The impairments of the CC were significantly correlated with the HIV clinic statics.ConclusionThe MVPA was sensitive to detect the HIV-related WM changes. Our findings indicated that the MVPA had considerable potential in exploring the HIV-related WM impairments.Key pointsâ€¢ WM impairments along motor pathway were detected among the ART-naÃ¯ve HIV patients
 â€¢ Prominent HIV-related WM impairments were observed in CC and frontal WM
 â€¢ The impairments of CC were significantly related to the HIV clinic statics
 â€¢ The CC might be susceptible to immune dysfunction and HIV replication
 â€¢ Multivariate pattern analysis had potential for studying the HIV-related white matter impairments",2017,European Radiology
A pliable lasso for the Cox model,"We introduce a pliable lasso method for estimation of interaction effects in the Cox proportional hazards model framework. The pliable lasso is a linear model that includes interactions between covariates X and a set of modifying variables Z and assumes sparsity of the main effects and interaction effects. The hierarchical penalty excludes interaction effects when the corresponding main effects are zero: this avoids overfitting and an explosion of model complexity. We extend this method to the Cox model for survival data, incorporating modifiers that are either fixed or varying in time into the partial likelihood. For example, this allows modeling of survival times that differ based on interactions of genes with age, gender, or other demographic information. The optimization is done by blockwise coordinate descent on a second order approximation of the objective.",2018,arXiv: Applications
Valid simultaneous inference in high-dimensional settings (with the HDM package for R),"Due to the increasing availability of high-dimensional empirical applications in many research disciplines, valid simultaneous inference becomes more and more important. For instance, high-dimensional settings might arise in economic studies due to very rich data sets with many potential covariates or in the analysis of treatment heterogeneities. Also the evaluation of potentially more complicated (non-linear) functional forms of the regression relationship leads to many potential variables for which simultaneous inferential statements might be of interest. Here we provide a review of classical and modern methods for simultaneous inference in (high-dimensional) settings and illustrate their use by a case study using the R package hdm. The R package hdm implements valid joint powerful and efficient hypothesis tests for a potentially large number of coeffcients as well as the construction of simultaneous confidence intervals and, therefore, provides useful methods to perform valid post-selection inference based on the LASSO.",2019,arXiv: Econometrics
Factors Associated With Nutritional Risk Among Homebound Older Adults With Depressive Symptoms.,"OBJECTIVES
This study used the Evans model of public health determinants to identify factors associated with nutritional risk in older adults.


DESIGN
The Evans model domains (physical and mental well-being, social/environmental statuses, individual choice, and economic security) were measured in a sample of homebound older adults. Regularized logistic regression analysis with LASSO penalty function was used to determine the strongest domain of the Evans model. Using traditional logistic regression, individual variables across all domains were compared to identify the significant predictors.


SETTING
Older adults receiving home meal services were referred to the study by community program staff.


PARTICIPANTS
Participants included 164 homebound older adults (age > 60) who endorsed at least one gateway symptom of depression.


MEASUREMENTS
Measurements: Nutritional risk was determined using the Mini Nutritional Assessment. Domains of the Evans model were measured using the MAI Medical Condition Checklist, items from the IADL scale, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, the Duke Social Support Index, living arrangements, marital status, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, items from the SCID Screening Module, and a self-report of perceived financial security.


RESULTS
Poor mental well-being, defined by a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, was identified as the strongest Evans model domain in the prediction of nutritional risk. When each variable was independently evaluated across domains, instrumental support (Waldâ€™s Z=-2.24, p=0.03) and a history of drug use (Waldâ€™s Z=-2.40, p=0.02) were significant predictors.


CONCLUSIONS
The Evans model is a useful conceptual framework for understanding nutritional health, with the mental domain found to be the strongest domain predictor of nutritional risk. Among individual variables across domains, having someone to help with shopping and food preparation and a history of drug use were associated with lower nutritional risk. These analyses highlight potential targets of intervention for nutritional risk among older adults.",2016,The Journal of frailty & aging
Implementing the ADMM to Big Datasets : A Case Study of LASSO,"The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been popularly used for a wide range of applications in the literature. When big datasets with high-dimensional variables are considered, subproblems arising from the ADMM must be solved inexactly even though theoretically they may have closed-form solutions. Such a scenario immediately poses mathematical ambiguities such as how accurately these subproblems should be solved and whether or not the convergence can be still guaranteed. Despite of the popularity of ADMM, it seems not too much is known in these regards. In this paper, we look into the mathematical detail of implementing the ADMM to such big-data scenarios. More specifically, we focus on the convex programming case where there is a quadratic function component with extremely high-dimensional variables in the objective of the model under discussion and thus there is a huge-scale system of linear equations to be solved at each iteration of the ADMM. We show that there is no need (indeed it is impossible) to solve this linear system exactly or too accurately; and propose an automatically adjustable inexactness criterion to solve these linear systems inexactly. We further identify the safe-guard numbers for the internally nested iterations that can sufficiently ensure this inexactness criterion if these linear systems are solved by standard numerical linear algebra solvers. The convergence, together with worst-case convergence rate measured by the iteration complexity, is rigorously established for the ADMM with inexactly-solved subproblems. Some numerical experiments for big datasets of the LASSO with millions of variables are reported to show the efficiency of this inexact implementation of ADMM.",2017,

A composite score associated with spontaneous operational tolerance in kidney transplant recipients.,"New challenges in renal transplantation include using biological information to devise a useful clinical test for discerning high- and low-risk patients for individual therapy and ascertaining the best combination and appropriate dosages of drugs. Based on a 20-gene signature from a microarray meta-analysis performed on 46 operationally tolerant patients and 266 renal transplant recipients with stable function, we applied the sparse Bolasso methodology to identify a minimal and robust combination of six genes and two demographic parameters associated with operational tolerance. This composite score of operational tolerance discriminated operationally tolerant patients with an area under the curve of 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.94-1.00). The score was not influenced by immunosuppressive treatment, center of origin, donor type, or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder history of the patients. This composite score of operational tolerance was significantly associated with both de novo anti-HLA antibodies and tolerance loss. It was validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction using independent samples and demonstrated specificity toward a model of tolerance induction. Thus, our score would allow clinicians to improve follow-up of patients, paving the way for individual therapy.",2017,Kidney international
Penalized model-based clustering with unconstrained covariance matrices.,"Clustering is one of the most useful tools for high-dimensional analysis, e.g., for microarray data. It becomes challenging in presence of a large number of noise variables, which may mask underlying clustering structures. Therefore, noise removal through variable selection is necessary. One effective way is regularization for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection in model-based clustering. However, existing methods focus on regularizing the mean parameters representing centers of clusters, ignoring dependencies among variables within clusters, leading to incorrect orientations or shapes of the resulting clusters. In this article, we propose a regularized Gaussian mixture model permitting a treatment of general covariance matrices, taking various dependencies into account. At the same time, this approach shrinks the means and covariance matrices, achieving better clustering and variable selection. To overcome one technical challenge in estimating possibly large covariance matrices, we derive an E-M algorithm utilizing the graphical lasso (Friedman et al 2007) for parameter estimation. Numerical examples, including applications to microarray gene expression data, demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.",2009,Electronic journal of statistics
Robust Generalized Fuzzy Systems Training from High-Dimensional Time-Series Data using Local Structure Preserving PLS,"Establishing fuzzy models from time-series data with predictive capabilities for numerical targets typically requires dimension reduction techniques to overcome red the severe curse of dimensionality effects. Linear projection methods are promising candidates in this context as they â€” unlike non-linear dimension reduction techniques â€” preserve interpretability of the resulting models. However, linear projections do not reveal the inherent (non-linear, local) cluster structure of the data and are thus not ideally suited for the identification of fuzzy rule bases. To overcome this limitation, we here present a new fuzzy modeling approach that combines generalized fuzzy systems modeling with a local structure preserving variant of partial least squares (PLS). In contrast to ordinary PLS, our approach maps a weighted (adjacency) graph on the directions associated with high co-variance with the response in order to emphasizes local data structures when constructing the latent variable (LV) space. This operates into the direction from which the (training of the) fuzzy model benefits, as therein local regions are represented by sub-models in form of generalized TS fuzzy rules. The local structure preserving LV space is obtained by solving a new penalized objective function, which assures $global\ optimality$ of the solutions by virtue of the specific properties of the Laplacian matrix. Local regions are characterized in two ways, i.) through nearest neighbor points (assuming fixed local region sizes) and ii.) through density regions identified by clustering (achieving variable local region sizes). To establish a robust time-series based forecast model, the training of a generalized TS fuzzy model is conducted in the LV space with reduced dimensionality. It is realized by an iterative robust version of $Gen \text{-} Smart \text{-} EFS$ 
, allowing multiple passes over the complete data sets until convergence of the antecedent space. Consequent parameters are estimated by a fuzzily weighted elastic net approach, embedding a convex combination of ridge regression and Lasso to achieve robust solutions also in case of ill-posed problems and meeting the (more stable and interpretable) local learning spirit. The new approach is termed as $LS \text{-} PLS \text{-} Fuzzy$ 
, short for $local\ structure\ preserving\ partial\ least\ squares\ fuzzy\ regression$ 
). An extension of the new approach also takes into account the non-local structure of the data and combines it in a clever way with the local structure preserving aspect through a combined Laplacian matrix in the penalization term; termed as LSNLS PLS-Fuzzy. It was successfully evaluated on three real-world application scenarios including a total of 11 time-series based prediction modeling problems with different proportions between the number of training samples and original input dimensionality. Our results show significantly improved model accuracy compared to i) related SoA modeling approaches, ii) an alternative dimension reduction technique, and iii) when using conventional PLS and/or non-generalized fuzzy rules.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems
Semiparametric IV Estimation and Model Selection with Weak Instruments and Heteroskedasticity,"This paper proposes a new two stage least squares (2SLS) estimator which is consistent and asymptotically normal in the presence of many weak instruments and heteroskedasticity. The rst stage of the estimator consists of two components: rst, an adaptive absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) that selects the instruments; and second, an OLS regression with the selected regressors. The adaptive LASSO is constructed to allow the possibility of either a nonparametric or parametric model. The second stage uses an OLS regression with the tted values of the rst stage. The methodology exploits the model selection benets of the adaptive LASSO, reduces its post-selection bias, and is the rst time a nonparametric adaptive LASSO is analyzed in the presence of instrument weakness.",2011,
Type I and Type II Bayesian Methods for Sparse Signal Recovery Using Scale Mixtures,"In this paper, we propose a generalized scale mixture family of distributions, namely the Power Exponential Scale Mixture (PESM) family, to model the sparsity inducing priors currently in use for sparse signal recovery (SSR). We show that the successful and popular methods such as LASSO, Reweighted â„“1 and Reweighted â„“2 methods can be formulated in an unified manner in a maximum a posteriori (MAP) or Type I Bayesian framework using an appropriate member of the PESM family as the sparsity inducing prior. In addition, exploiting the natural hierarchical framework induced by the PESM family, we utilize these priors in a Type II framework and develop the corresponding EM based estimation algorithms. Some insight into the differences between Type I and Type II methods is provided and of particular interest in the algorithmic development is the Type II variant of the popular and successful reweighted â„“1 method. Extensive empirical results are provided, and they show that the Type II methods exhibit better support recovery than the corresponding Type I methods.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
In defence of the sketch: City and Landscape in the Architecture of Julio Cano Lasso,"This essay aims to describe, analyse and value the drawing as â€œthe fast and nervous outline, which captures the essential featuresâ€ of the landscape and the city that is installed in it, first as host and then as hostess, through specific projects by architect Julio Cano Lasso, in our view paradigmatic, intimately linked to the landscape that the city recreates and creates. We have chosen four flagship cities in this aspect: Santiago de Compostela, Salamanca, Toledo and Cuenca. In all of them it reflects, through the drawing, his project,always attentive to the landscape in its double sense, natural and artificial, and he puts into practice his passion for what he calls â€œhistorical citiesâ€, of which the aforementioned are an indisputable example. Objective of this article is to unravel the deep links that exist between the urban landscape of the cities that the architect draws and the architecture that projects as part of it, to unveil the common thread of his trade, understood as a dialogue between the place and the program. Our method will take us from the analysis of his drawings of the landscape of the city in his territory to the exercise of synthesis and composition of an architecture, as is his case, aware of his environment and in resonance with it. The results of this iterative process between landscape and architecture through the drawing that makes an appearance in each and every one of its steps, are the proof of an exercise of coherence in the process of creation of the work of this architect. The innovation of our work is precisely to provide a different view of the work of Cano Lasso through these drawings, and from them, our main references.",2019,
Predicting the Trends of Social Events on Chinese Social Media,"Growing interest in social events on social media came along with the rapid development of the Internet. Social events that occur in the ""real"" world can spread on social media (e.g., Sina Weibo) rapidly, which may trigger severe consequences and thus require the government's timely attention and responses. This article proposes to predict the trends of social events on Sina Weibo, which is currently the most popular social media in China. Based on the theories of social psychology and communication sciences, we extract an unprecedented amount of comprehensive and effective features that relate to the trends of social events on Chinese social media, and we construct the trends of prediction models by using three classical regression algorithms. We found that lasso regression performed better with the precision 0.78 and the recall 0.88. The results of our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",2017,"Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking"
Testing for Differences in Gaussian Graphical Models: Applications to Brain Connectivity,"Functional brain networks are well described and estimated from data with Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs), e.g. using sparse inverse covariance estimators. Comparing functional connectivity of subjects in two population calls for comparing these estimated GGMs. We study the problem of identifying differences in Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) known to have similar structure. We aim to characterize the uncertainty of differences with confidence intervals obtained using a para-metric distribution on parameters of a sparse estimator. Sparse penalties enable statistical guarantees and interpretable models even in high-dimensional and low-number-of-samples settings. Quantifying the uncertainty of the parameters selected by the sparse penalty is an important question in applications such as neuroimaging or bioinformatics. Indeed, selected variables can be interpreted to build theoretical understanding or to make therapeutic decisions. Characterizing the distributions of sparse regression models is inherently challenging since the penalties produce a biased estimator. Recent work has shown how one can invoke the sparsity assumptions to effectively remove the bias from a sparse estimator such as the lasso. These distributions can be used to give us confidence intervals on edges in GGMs, and by extension their differences. However, in the case of comparing GGMs, these estimators do not make use of any assumed joint structure among the GGMs. Inspired by priors from brain functional connectivity we focus on deriving the distribution of parameter differences under a joint penalty when parameters are known to be sparse in the difference. This leads us to introduce the debiased multi-task fused lasso. We show that we can debias and characterize the distribution in an efficient manner. We then go on to show how the debiased lasso and multi-task fused lasso can be used to obtain confidence intervals on edge differences in Gaussian graphical models. We validate the techniques proposed on a set of synthetic examples as well as neuro-imaging dataset created for the study of autism.",2016,
A General Family of Penalties for Combining Differing Types of Penalties in Generalized Structured Models,"Penalized estimation has become an established tool for regularization and model selection in regression models. 
A variety of penalties with specific features are available 
and effective algorithms for specific penalties have been proposed. 
But not much is available to fit models that call for a combination of different penalties. 
When modeling rent data, which will be considered as an example, various types of predictors call for a combination of a Ridge, a grouped Lasso and a Lasso-type penalty within one model. 
Algorithms that can deal with such problems, are in demand. 
We propose to approximate penalties that are (semi-)norms of scalar linear transformations of the coefficient vector in generalized structured models. 
The penalty is very general such that the Lasso, the fused Lasso, the Ridge, the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty (SCAD), the elastic net and many more penalties are embedded. 
The approximation allows to combine all these penalties within one model. 
The computation is based on conventional penalized iteratively re-weighted least squares (PIRLS) algorithms and hence, easy to implement. 
Moreover, new penalties can be incorporated quickly. 
The approach is also extended to penalties with vector based arguments; that is, to penalties with norms of linear transformations of the coefficient vector. 
Some illustrative examples and the model for the Munich rent data show promising results.",2013,
La tradiciÃ³n en el pensamiento arquitectÃ³nico de Julio Cano Lasso. La tradiciÃ³n como sistema,"espanolPartimos de la idea de que el tema central en la arquitectura y el pensamiento de Julio Cano Lasso es la forma de transmision y pervivencia del pasado en el presente, es decir; la tradicion. Esta investigacion adopta en Cano una forma dual. Por un lado, la tradicion considerada como un flujo continuo, con mantenimiento de caracteristicas estructurales constantes y sometido a un proceso de seleccion inmanente que descarta lo superfluo y destila solo lo valioso. Deriva en el uso de la tipologia como metodo proyectual. Por otro lado, la tradicion insertada dentro la temporalidad fraccionada de la memoria personal que destruye la historia como continuidad y como inmanencia y se aleja del evolucionismo y las pretensiones teleologicas del anterior supuesto. Se revela en su obra mediante el uso del metodo referencial. En este texto nos ocupamos de analizar el pensamiento del arquitecto respecto a la primera linea conceptual. Revisamos los escritos de Cano y, por medio de la confrontacion con sus fuentes documentadas, Ortega y Gasset y Pedro Salinas, y con los escritos de otros autores como Aldo van Eyck, Igor Stravinski, Alasdair MacIntyre, T. S. Eliot o Eugenio Trias, tratamos de desentranar el sentido de la tradicion como sistema para el arquitecto junto con el de otros conceptos asociados: tecnica, historia, evolucion, progreso, modernidad, originalidad y eclecticismo. EnglishWe start from the idea that the focus on architecture and the thought of Julio Cano Lasso is the mode of transmission and survival of the past in the present, ie; the tradition. This research adopts in Cano a dual form. On one hand, the tradition considered as a continuous flow, maintaining constant structural characteristics and subjected to a selection process immanent that discards what is superfluous and distills only what is valuable. This theoretical statement results in the use of typology as a design method. On the other hand,,there is tradition inserted into the fractional temporality of personal memory that destroys history as continuity and as immanence, and moves away from the evolutionism and the teleological claims of the previous statement. The latter is revealed in his work by using the reference method. In this paper we deal with analyzing the architect thinking regarding the first conceptual line. We review the writings of Cano and, through the comparison with their documented sources, Ortega y Gasset and Pedro Salinas, and the writings of other authors such as Aldo van Eyck, Igor Stravinsky, Alasdair MacIntyre, T.S.

Volatility Connectedness in Global Foreign Exchange Markets,"Abstract We statically and dynamically measure total and directional volatility connectedness in global foreign exchange (forex) markets. We use the volatility spillover index and LASSO-VAR approaches in the variance decomposition framework to construct high-dimensional volatility connectedness network linking 65 major currencies. Empirical results indicate that the US dollar (USD) and Euro are major volatility transmitters while other currencies including Japanese yen and British pound are basically net volatility receivers. In volatility connectedness network, currencies tend to be clustered according to geographical distributions. Dynamically, total volatility connectedness reacts sensitively to changes in international economic fundamentals and increases during crisis periods. Directional volatility connectedness of Renminbi has decreased significantly since the reforms of the Chinese exchange rate regime (which shifts from a USD-pegged exchange rate regime to a regulated, managed floating exchange rate regime). Generally, oil exports, forex regimes and monetary policies are major factors driving volatility transmission across global forex markets.",2020,Journal of Multinational Financial Management
Clinical implications of reconnection between the left atrium and isolated pulmonary veins provoked by adenosine triphosphate after extensive encircling pulmonary vein isolation.,"INTRODUCTION
Dormant pulmonary vein (PV) conduction can be provoked by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) after extensive encircling pulmonary vein isolation (EEPVI). However, the clinical implication of reconnection between the left atrium (LA) and isolated PVs provoked by ATP (ATP-reconnection) remains unknown.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We studied the clinical consequences of ATP-reconnection during intravenous isoproterenol infusion (ISP-infusion). EEPVI severs conduction between the LA and ipsilateral PVs at their junction. Radiofrequency energy is applied at a distance from the PV ostia guided by double Lasso catheters placed within the ipsilateral superior and inferior PVs. This study comprised 82 patients (67 men, 56 +/- 9 years old) with atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent injection of ATP during ISP infusion after successful EEPVI (ATP(+) group). We compared clinical characteristics of 170 patients who underwent earlier EEPVI prior to our use of ATP injection after successful EEPVI (ATP(N/D) group) with those of ATP(+) group patients who underwent one session of EEPVI. ATP-reconnection occurred in 34 (41%) of 82 ATP(+) group patients. Additional radiofrequency applications were performed to eliminate ATP-reconnection in all ipsilateral PVs. Continuous ATP-reconnection of more than 20 seconds duration occurred in six (7.3%) of 82 patients. A total of 102 (60%) of 170 patients in the ATP(N/D) group had no recurrence of AF, whereas 60 (73%) of 82 ATP(+) group patients who underwent only one EEPVI session have had no recurrence of AF in a 6.1 +/- 3.3-month follow-up period (P = 0.04).


CONCLUSION
Radiofrequency application for provoked ATP-reconnection may reduce clinical AF recurrence.",2007,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology
Onchocerciasis: A Reality in Western Burkina Faso in 2016,"Sporadic cases of onchocerciasis continue to be registered after intensive campaigns under the aegis of the Onchocerchiasis Control program (OCP) that led to the control of the disease in Burkina Faso since 2010. It is now part of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDS). We report 3 recent confirmed cases at the Teaching Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso, that are worrying in this context. There were two men and a woman, all coming from the west area of Burkina Faso, border with Ivory Coast and Ghana, and they have intermittent stays in a side and other of the two borders. The reason for consultation was a chronic pruritus evolving since 2 to 4 years. The examination noted dermatological damages combining in a variable way, painless and mobile nodules localized at the trochanters and chest seats, a leuco-melanodermia of the legs or polymorph chronic prurigo lesions, without nodules. The diagnosis of onchoceriasis was confirmed by presence of blood hyper-eosinophilia, the presence of many Onchocerca volvulus micofilariaes in the dermal juice and many adult worms in histology. Because that Onchocerciasis became quite rare in everyday practice, the statement of 3 hospital cases collected in 8 months is worrying because the vector and the parasite are still present in the affected areas, with a possible transmission. So, a new outbreak is to fear, especially with the internal and cross-border population mobility.",2016,Journal of Tropical Diseases & Public Health
Linking GC-MS and PTR-TOF-MS fingerprints of food samples,"Abstract Recently the first applications in food science and technology of the newly available volatile organic compound (VOC) detection technique proton transfer reactionâ€mass spectrometry, coupled with a time of flight mass analyzer (PTR-TOF-MS), have been published. In comparison with standard techniques such as GC-MS, PTR-TOF-MS has the remarkable advantage of being extremely fast but has the drawback that compound identification is more challenging and often not possible without further information. In order to better exploit and understand the analytical information entangled in the PTR-TOF-MS fingerprint and to link it with SPME/GC-MS analyses we employed two multivariate calibration methods, PLS and the more recent LASSO. We show that, while in some cases it is sufficient to consider a single PTR-TOF-MS peak in order to predict the intensity of a SPME/GC-MS peak, in general a multivariate approach is needed. We compare the performances of PLS and LASSO in terms of prediction capabilities and interpretability of the model coefficients and conclude that LASSO is more suitable for this problem. As case study, we compared GC and PTR-MS data for different matrices, namely olive oil and grana cheese.",2012,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems
Binds to the Extreme C Terminus of SNAP 25 to Mediate the Action of Gi / o-Coupled G Protein â€“ Coupled Receptors,"Gi/o-coupled G proteinâ€“coupled receptors can exert an inhibitory effect on vesicle release through several G proteinâ€“driven mechanisms, more than one of which may be concurrently present in individual presynaptic terminals. The synaptosomalassociated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP25) is a key downstream effector of Gbg subunits. It has previously been shown that proteolytic cleavage of SNAP25 by botulinum toxin A reduces the ability of Gbg to compete with the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) for binding to SNAP25 in a calcium-dependent manner. These truncated SNAP25 proteins sustain a low level of exocytosis but are unable to support serotonin-mediated inhibition of exocytosis in lamprey spinal neurons. Here, we generate a SNAP25 extreme C-terminal mutant that is deficient in its ability to bind Gbg while retaining normal calciumdependent Syt1 binding to soluble N-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptor (SNARE) and vesicle release. The SNAP25D3 mutant, in which residue G204 is replaced by a stop codon, features a partial reduction in Gb1g2 binding in vitro as well as a partial reduction in the ability of the lamprey 5hydroxytryptamine1bâ€“type serotonin receptor to reduce excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes, an effect previously shown to be mediated through the interaction of Gbg with SNAP25. Syt1 calcium-dependent binding to SNAP25D3 was reduced by a small extent compared with the wild type. We conclude that the extreme C terminus of SNAP25 is a critical region for the Gbg-SNARE interaction.",2015,
Accelerated hyperfractionated radiochemotherapy with temozolomide is equivalent to normofractionated radiochemotherapy in a retrospective analysis of patients with glioblastoma,"BackgroundCurrent standard of treatment for newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma (GBM) is surgical resection with adjuvant normofractionated radiotherapy (NFRT) combined with temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. Hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HFRT) which was known as an option from randomized controlled trials before the temozolomide era has not been compared to the standard therapy in a randomized setting combined with TMZ.MethodsData of 152 patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated from 10/2004 until 7/2018 at a single tertiary care institution were extracted from a clinical database and retrospectively analyzed. Thirty-eight patients treated with NFRT of 60â€‰Gy in 30 fractions (34 with simultaneous and 2 with sequential TMZ) were compared to 114 patients treated with HFRT of 54.0â€‰Gy in 30 fraction of 1.8â€‰Gy twice daily (109 with simultaneous and 3 with sequential TMZ). The association between treatment protocol and other variables with overall survival (OS) was assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis; the latter was performed using variables selected by the LASSO method.ResultsMedian overall survival (OS) was 20.3â€‰month for the entire cohort. For patients treated with NFRT median OS was 24.4â€‰months compared to 18.5â€‰months in patients treated with HFRT (pÂ =â€‰0.131). In univariable regression analysis the use of dexamethasone during radiotherapy had a significant negative impact on OS in both patient groups, HR 2.21 (95% CI 1.47â€“3.31, pÂ =â€‰0.0001). In multivariable analysis adjusted for O6-methylguanine-DNA methyl-transferase (MGMT) promotor methylation status, salvage treatment and secondary GBM, the use of dexamethasone was still a negative prognostic factor, HR 1.95 (95% CI 1.21â€“3.13, pÂ =â€‰0.006). Positive MGMT-methylation status and salvage treatment were highly significant positive prognostic factors. There was no strong association between treatment protocol and OS (pÂ =â€‰0.504).ConclusionsOur retrospective analysis supports the hypothesis of equivalence between HFRT and the standard protocol of treatment for GBM. For those patients who are willing to obtain the benefit of shortening the course of radiochemotherapy, HFRT may be an alternative with comparable efficacy although it was not yet tested in a large prospective randomized study against the current standard. The positive influence of salvage therapy and negative impact of concomitant use of corticosteroids should be addressed in future prospective trials. To confirm our results, we plan to perform a pooled analysis with other tertiary clinics in order to achieve better statistical reliability.",2019,"Radiation Oncology (London, England)"
Gap Safe screening rules for faster complex-valued multi-task group Lasso,"Linear regression with sparsity-inducing penalties is a popular tool for high-dimensional problems such as source localization or denoising [1, 4]. The Group Lasso is a particular choice of convex penalty that considers the `2,1 norm to promote group (or block) sparsity patterns. Since no general closed-form solution is available for this problem, iterative solvers are needed. This can lead to very slow convergence especially if the problem is ill-conditioned or if the dimension of the problem is particularly large. Safe screening rules [5] (see also [15]) and in particular dynamic ones [2, 3] speed-up the optimization process by progressively discarding regressors identified as irrelevant. In this work, we consider the case where features and observations can be complex-valued, a common case in signal processing when working with time-frequency operators. We derive Gap Safe screening rules in this context and propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) optimization strategy [14, 7]. In practice, we illustrate significant speed-ups in terms of convergence compared to classical solvers on a neuroscience problem, namely the problem of source localization using magnetoand electroencephalography (M/EEG). I. The complex-valued multi-task group Lasso In the following, n is the number of observations (or sensors), q the number of tasks (or time instants), and p the number of features (or variables). Given observations Y âˆˆ CnÃ—q, a design matrix (or forward operator) X âˆˆ CnÃ—p and a set of groups G (i.e., a partition of {1, . . . , p}) the complex-valued multitask group Lasso solves PÎ»(Î²) : Î²âˆ— âˆˆ arg min Î²âˆˆCpÃ—q 1 2 â€–Y âˆ’XÎ²â€– 2 F + Î» â€–Î²â€–F,1, where Î» > 0 is a regularization parameter, â€–Î²â€–F,1 = âˆ‘ gâˆˆG â€–Î²gâ€–F , Î²g denotes the sub-matrix of Î² composed of rows whose indices are in g and â€–Aâ€–F = ( âˆ‘ i,j |Ai,j |) 1 2 denotes the Frobenius norm of A. For z, zâ€² âˆˆ C, instead of the Hermitian inner product ã€ˆz, zã€‰H = âˆ‘d i=1 zizÌ„ â€² i we use ã€ˆz, zâ€²ã€‰ = 1 2 âˆ‘d i=1(zizÌ„ â€² i + zÌ„iz i). Contrary to ã€ˆÂ·, Â·ã€‰H, it is real-valued and enables us to define the Fenchel conjugate of a function f : C â†’ R as fâˆ— : u 7â†’ supzâˆˆCdã€ˆu, zã€‰ âˆ’ f(u). For X,Y âˆˆ CdÃ—d â€² , we consider ã€ˆX,Y ã€‰ = 1 2 tr(X HY + Y HX). Using this we can prove that â€–Â·â€–F,1 = â€–Â·â€–F,âˆž, and that 1 2 â€–Â·â€– 2 F is its self Fenchel conjugate. The dual problem of PÎ»(Î²) then reads: sup Î¸âˆˆCnÃ—q inf Î²âˆˆCpÃ—q Î¼âˆˆCnÃ—q 1 2 â€–Î¼â€– 2 F + Î» â€–Î²â€–F,1 + ã€ˆÎ¸, Î¼âˆ’ Y +XÎ²ã€‰ . With the properties of the Fenchel transform, this amounts to solving DÎ»(Î¸): max Î¸âˆˆâˆ†X â€–Y â€–F /2 âˆ’ Î» 2â€–Y/Î»âˆ’ Î¸â€–F /2, introducing the dual feasible set âˆ†X = { Î¸ âˆˆ CnÃ—q | â€–XÎ¸â€–F,âˆž â‰¤ 1 } . A popular iterative solver for the multi-task group lasso uses a BCD scheme [13]: at each iteration k, for each group g successively, PÎ»(Î²) is optimized w.r.t. Î²g. II. Gap safe screening rules for complex Lasso Let Î²âˆ— be an optimal solution of PÎ»(Î²) and Î¸âˆ— be the (unique) dual solution, both linked through Y = XÎ²âˆ— + Î»Î¸âˆ—. Fermatâ€™s rule reads: âˆ€g,X g Î¸ âˆˆ âˆ‚â€–Î² gâ€–F = { Î²âˆ— g/ âˆ¥âˆ¥Î²âˆ— gâˆ¥âˆ¥F , if Î²âˆ— g 6= 0 Bâ€–Â·â€–F , otherwise , where âˆ‚â€–Â·â€–F is defined relatively to ã€ˆÂ·, Â·ã€‰, and Bâ€–Â·â€–F is the â€–Â·â€–F unit ball. We thus have â€–XH g Î¸â€–F < 1â‡’ Î²âˆ— g = 0. Î¸âˆ— being unknown, this rule has to be relaxed: given a safe region C containing Î¸âˆ—, we can upper bound â€–XH g Î¸â€–F and the rule becomes supÎ¸âˆˆCâ€–X g Î¸â€–F < 1â‡’ Î²âˆ— g = 0. In a series of work [6, 10, 11] so called Gap Safe rule have been proposed. It uses at iteration k the safe ball centered on Î¸k = (Y âˆ’XÎ²k)/(Î»Î±k) (with Î±k s.t. Î¸k âˆˆ âˆ†X), with radius âˆš 2(PÎ»(Î²k)âˆ’DÎ»(Î¸k))/Î»2. To ensure that DÎ»(Î¸k) is increasing, we slightly modify this rule, and update Î¸k only when DÎ»(Î¸k) > DÎ»(Î¸kâˆ’1). We use Î¸0 = Y/Î»max, where Î»max = â€–XHY â€–F,âˆž. III. Numerical experiments The M/EEG inverse problem with `2,1 regularization leads to a particular case of multi-task group Lasso [12]: in this context, Y is a matrix of sensor measurements (n signals of length q), X is the composition of the forward operator (encoding the electromagnetic dependency between source amplitudes and measurements) and a time-frequency decomposition operator, and Î² is the complex-valued matrix of time-frequency coefficients [9]. We adopt the free orientation setting which leads to the estimation of a vector field: blocks of three consecutives rows of Î² represent the activity of one source, decomposed over three orthogonal spatial dimensions. Imposing a â€–Â·â€–F,1 group penalty over these blocks results in a solution where only a few sources are active (i.e., a few rows of Î²âˆ— are non zero), which is a desired property from a biological standpoint. We use data from the MNE dataset [8], with 302 MEG sensors, 7498 sources (22494 oriented dipoles), and 181 time instants which corresponds to about 300ms of event related field data following an auditory stimulation in the left ear. We decompose the signals over 1518 time-frequency atoms. We evaluate the acceleration obtained with dynamic screening for different values of Î» (screening every 10 pass over all groups with Î²0 = 0). Figure 1 shows objective convergence for Î» = Î»max/4. Screening restricts the BCD steps to a smaller and smaller set of sources, resulting in significant acceleration. As we see in Figure 2, a high Î» results in very sparse solutions, for which screening is well-suited. On the contrary, for a very low Î», few features are discarded and screening does not greatly speed up the convergence.",2017,
