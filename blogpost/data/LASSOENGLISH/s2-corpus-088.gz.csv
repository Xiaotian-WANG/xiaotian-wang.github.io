Rank-Based Methods for Single-Index Varying Coefficient Models,"The single-index varying coefficient model has received much attention due to its flexibility and interpretability in recent years. This dissertation is mainly concerned with the rank-based estimation and variable selection in single-index varying coefficient models. In the first part of this dissertation, we consider a rank-based estimation of the index parameter and the coefficient functions for single-index varying coefficient model. The consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators are established. An extensive Monte-Carlo simulation study demonstrates the robustness and the efficiency of the proposed estimators compared to the least squares estimators. The rank-based approach was motivated by a problem from fisheries ecology where it is used to provide accurate estimates of interspecies dependence along an environmental gradient. We use a real data example to show that the classical approach is highly affected by outliers in response space but not the rank-based method we proposed in this dissertation. The second part of this dissertation is based on variable selection method for single-index varying coefficient model. We develop a LASSO-type rank-based variable selection procedure to select and estimate coefficient functions. A Monte-Carlo simulation study shows that the proposed method is highly robust and efficient compared to least squares type approaches. Our method can be easily applied to single-index and varying coefficient models since they are special cases of single-index varying coefficient model. ii Acknowledgments This dissertation would not have been possible without the support of many people.

Estimation and Feature Selection in High-Dimensional Mixtures-of-Experts Models,"This thesis deals with the problem of modeling and estimation of high-dimensional MoE models, towards effective density estimation, prediction and clustering of such heterogeneous and high-dimensional data. We propose new strategies based on regularized maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of MoE models to overcome the limitations of standard methods, including MLE estimation with Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, and to simultaneously perform feature selection so that sparse models are encouraged in such a high-dimensional setting. We first introduce a mixture-of-experts' parameter estimation and variable selection methodology, based on $\ell_1$ (lasso) regularizations and the EM framework, for regression and clustering suited to high-dimensional contexts. Then, we extend the method to regularized mixture of experts models for discrete data, including classification. We develop efficient algorithms to maximize the proposed $\ell_1$-penalized observed-data log-likelihood function. Our proposed strategies enjoy the efficient monotone maximization of the optimized criterion, and unlike previous approaches, they do not rely on approximations on the penalty functions, avoid matrix inversion, and exploit the efficiency of the coordinate ascent algorithm, particularly within the proximal Newton-based approach.",2019,
Exact Calabi-Yau categories and disjoint Lagrangian spheres,"An exact Calabi-Yau structure, originally introduced by Keller, is a special kind of smooth Calabi-Yau structures in the sense of Kontsevich-Vlassopoulos. For a Weinstein manifold $M$, the existence of an exact Calabi-Yau structure on its wrapped Fukaya category $\mathcal{W}(M)$ imposes strong restrictions on its symplectic topology. Under the cyclic open-closed map constructed by Ganatra, an exact Calabi-Yau structure on $\mathcal{W}(M)$ induces a class $\tilde{b}$ in the degree one equivariant symplectic cohomology $\mathit{SH}_{S^1}^1(M)$. In particular, any Weinstein manifold admitting a quasi-dilation in the sense of Seidel-Solomon has an exact Calabi-Yau wrapped Fukaya category. We prove that for many Weinstein manifolds with exact Calabi-Yau $\mathcal{W}(M)$, there is an upper bound on the number of pairwise disjoint Lagrangian spheres, and the homology classes of these Lagrangian spheres are non-trivial. On the other hand, we show that the wrapped Fukaya category of the Milnor fiber of a 3-fold triple point is exact Calabi-Yau despite that there is no quasi-dilation.",2019,arXiv: Symplectic Geometry
Genome Mining and Heterologous Expression Reveal Two Distinct Families of Lasso Peptides Highly Conserved in Endofungal Bacteria.,"Genome mining identified the fungal-bacterial endosymbiosis Rhizopus microsporus-Mycetohabitans (previously: Burkholderia) rhizoxinica as a rich source of novel natural products. Yet, most of the predicted compounds have remained cryptic. In this study we employed heterologous expression to isolate and characterize three ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) with lariat topology (lasso peptides) from the endosymbiont M. rhizoxinica: burhizin-23, mycetohabin-16 and mycetohabin-15. Through coexpression experiments it was shown that an orphan gene product results in mature mycetohabin-15, albeit encoded remotely from the core biosynthetic gene cluster. Comparative genomics revealed that mycetohabins are highly conserved trait among M. rhizoxinica and related endosymbiotic bacteria. Gene knockout and reinfection experiments indicated that the lasso peptides are not crucial for establishing the symbiosis; instead, the peptides are exported into the environment during endosymbiosis. This is the first report on lasso peptides from endosymbiontic bacteria.",2019,ACS chemical biology
Asymptotic behavior of dynamic local-field corrections for electron liquids,"Abstract We prove that the large- k asymptotic behavior of dynamic local-field corrections G( k , Ï‰) for the electron liquids differ in quantum and classical treatments. In the quantum case, one recovers a finite-temperature generalization of the Niklasson relation, lim kâ†’âˆž G( k ,Ï‰ = 2 3 [1âˆ’g(0)] , where g(0) is the radial distribution function at the origin.

Multi-task and multi-view learning based on particle swarm optimization for short-term traffic forecasting,"Abstract Spatiotemporal prediction modeling of traffic is an important issue in the field of spatiotemporal data mining. However, it is encountering multiple challenges such as the global spatiotemporal correlation between predictive tasks, balanced between spatiotemporal heterogeneity and the global predictive power of the model, and parameter optimization of prediction models. Most existing short-term traffic prediction methods only emphasize spatiotemporal dependence and heterogeneity, so it is difficult to get satisfactory prediction accuracy. In this paper, spatiotemporal multi-task and multi-view feature learning models based on particle swarm optimization are combined to concurrently address these challenges. First, cross-correlation is used to construct the spatiotemporal proximity view, periodic view and trend view of each road segment to characterize spatiotemporal dependence and heterogeneity. Second, the prediction results of three spatiotemporal views are obtained using a set of kernels, which is further regarded as a high-level heterogeneous semantic feature as the input of the multi-task multi-view feature learning model. Third, additional regularization terms (e.g., group Lasso penalty, graph Laplacian regularization) are utilized to constrain all tasks to select a set of shared features and ensure the relatedness between tasks and consistency between views, so that the predictive model has a good global predictive ability and can capture global spatiotemporal correlation in the road network. Finally, particle swarm optimization is introduced to obtain the optimal parameter set and enhance the training speed of the proposed model. Experimental studies on real vehicular-speed datasets collected on city roads demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperform the existing nine baseline methods in terms of prediction accuracy. The results suggest that the proposed model merits further attention for other spatiotemporal prediction tasks, such as water quality, crowd flow, owing to the versatility of the modeling process for spatiotemporal data.",2019,Knowl.

Erratum to: Model selection by LASSO methods in a change-point model,"The paper considers a linear regression model with multiple change-points occurring at unknown times. The LASSO technique is very interesting since it allows the parametric estimation, including the change-points, and automatic variable selection simultaneously. The asymptotic properties of the LASSO-type (which has as particular case the LASSO estimator) and of the adaptive LASSO estimators are studied. For this last estimator the oracle properties are proved. In both cases, a model selection criterion is proposed. Numerical examples are provided showing the performances of the adaptive LASSO estimator compared to the LS estimator.",2014,Statistical Papers
Relaxation time spectra of star polymers,"Abstractâ€‚The linear viscoelastic data for model star polymer melts with varying functionality and arm molecular weight were represented by means of a modified Baumgaertel-Schausberger-Winter (BSW) relaxation time spectrum, based on data analysis with the parsimonius model of Baumgaertel etâ€‰al., reported in 1990. In the case of high arm functionality, the second slow terminal relaxation observed by Vlassopoulos etâ€‰al. in 1997, was captured with a straightforward extension of the BSW model using broad cut-off functions. This study represents a potentially promising attempt to extend the applicability of this representation of viscoelastic data to more complex architectures, beyond simple linear chains which are characterized by self-similarity. The casting of linear viscoelastic data into spectra allows the exploration of star polymer behavior. It is a necessary step in preparation for large scale complex flow calculations in conjunction with constitutive models and for material databases.",2000,Rheologica Acta
"""Lens lasso"" repositioning of dislocated posterior chamber intraocular lenses.","BACKGROUND
Dislocation of posterior chamber intraocular lenses poses unique surgical problems for the vitreous surgeon. Although many methods have been devised to correct this problem, none are easily accomplished. A new technique that simplifies this task is described.


METHODS
Six patients with complete posteriorly dislocated posterior chamber intraocular lenses underwent this procedure. Five lenses had prolene haptics and one was all polymethylmethacrylate. All except one traumatic case were spontaneous dislocations. A 9-0 prolene suture was transocularly placed through opposite sides of the ciliary sulcus; slip knots were tied on the internal ends and these knots then used to ""lasso"" the intraocular lens haptics. This achieved, the lens was easily pulled back up into the ciliary sulcus.


RESULTS
All patients tolerated the procedure well without any complications. Lens centering was excellent and the externalized sutures showed no erosion through the conjunctiva. Visual acuity was 20/40 or better in all but the one patient with traumatic dislocation, who had a final visual acuity of 20/100. Average length of follow-up period was 17 months.


CONCLUSIONS
This surgical technique offers distinct advantages to the surgeon by eliminating cumbersome manipulation of the dislocated intraocular lens, more accuracy in lens replacement, and secure suture attachment to the lens haptics.",1994,Retina
A Lasso regression model for the construction of microRNA-target regulatory networks,"MOTIVATION
MicroRNAs have recently emerged as a major class of regulatory molecules involved in a broad range of biological processes and complex diseases. Construction of miRNA-target regulatory networks can provide useful information for the study and diagnosis of complex diseases. Many sequence-based and evolutionary information-based methods have been developed to identify miRNA-mRNA targeting relationships. However, as the amount of available miRNA and gene expression data grows, a more statistical and systematic method combining sequence-based binding predictions and expression-based correlation data becomes necessary for the accurate identification of miRNA-mRNA pairs.


RESULTS
We propose a Lasso regression model for the identification of miRNA-mRNA targeting relationships that combines sequence-based prediction information, miRNA co-regulation, RISC availability and miRNA/mRNA abundance data. By comparing this modelling approach with two other known methods applied to three different datasets, we found that the Lasso regression model has considerable advantages in both sensitivity and specificity. The regression coefficients in the model can be used to determine the true regulatory efficacies in tissues and was demonstrated using the miRNA target site type data. Finally, by constructing the miRNA regulatory networks in two stages of prostate cancer (PCa), we found the several significant miRNA-hubbed network modules associated with PCa metastasis. In conclusion, the Lasso regression model is a robust and informative tool for constructing the miRNA regulatory networks for diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases.


AVAILABILITY
The R program for predicting miRNA-mRNA targeting relationships using the Lasso regression model is freely available, along with the described datasets and resulting regulatory network, at http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/CZlab/alarmnet/. The source code is open for modification and application to other miRNA/mRNA expression datasets.

Sparse Prediction with the k-Overlap Norm,We derive a novel norm that corresponds to the tightest convex relaxation of sparsity combined with an l2 penalty and can also be interpreted as a group Lasso norm with overlaps. We show that this new norm provides a tighter relaxation than the elastic net and suggest using it as a replacement for the Lasso or the elastic net in sparse prediction problems.,2012,ArXiv
Poverty Prediction by Selected Remote Sensing CNN Features Final Report,"Remote sensing images with the convolutional neural network (CNN) model are proved to be an alternative approach to night-lights in poverty prediction. However, CNN model creates a high dimensional dataset, which may cause overfitting, and limit its performance. In this paper, we select on remote sensing CNN features to improve its performance. We leverage five feature selection methods: forward search, correlation search, principle components analysis (PCA), variational autoencoder (VAE) and lasso. All these features are then evaluated via linear, ridge and lasso regression method as well as XGBoost gradient boosting methods. We obtain robust feature sets that outperform night-lights intensities in poverty prediction.",2017,
Applications of Biological Markers to Characterize Petroleum and Source Rocks of the Southern Indus Basin,"Crude oils (20) and sediments (435) from the Southern Indus Basin have been geochemically studied. The analytical techniques used in this study are TOC analysis, Rock Eval, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Chapter 1 of this thesis presents an introduction of sedimentary OM, kerogen, aliphatic and aromatic biomarkers and their applications in geochemical evaluation. Chapter 2 describes samples and background geology of the study area, lithological description, petroleum systems and source rocks of the Southern Indus Basin. The experimental procedures and techniques for data collection and analysis are explained in Chapter 3. In chapter 4, distribution and relative abundances of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons have been applied to distinguish different oil families. Biomarker parameters divide the samples into three groups on the basis of source, depositional environment and lithology, thermal maturity of organic matter and in reservoir mixing study. Group I (BN, Palli, Sono, Thora, Dhamrkhi, BJ, T Alam, BMD, and BH) shows high Pr/Ph (3.26-4.46), bimodal n-alkane distribution and high abundance of C20+ n-alkanes. High concentration of 1,2,5-TMN, 1,7-DMP, high 1-MP/9-MP, presence of retene and low C27/C29 steranes support their likely origin from terrestrial source (coniferous plant). Group II (BS, BA, T A Yar and Resham) has moderate to high Pr/Ph (2.84-3.67), bimodal n-alkane distribution, presence of retene, low 1-MP/9-MP and moderate concentration of 1,2,5-TMN, 1,7-DMP. These samples probably have mixed (terrestrial and marine) source of organic matter. Group III of condensates (Baloch, Unnar, Shah, Pasahki East, Pakhro, Chandio and Gopang) is extremely low in biomarkers. The source rocks, probably marine oxic clastics having terrestrial OM have generated these waxy condensates under high thermal conditions. Marine oxic clastic source rocks for these condensates are also reflected from plots: DBT/P versus Pr/Ph, C29H/C30H versus C29-dia/(dia+Reg) steranes, Pr/Pr+Ph versus C29-dia/(dia+Reg) steranes and C27/C29 sterane versus C27/C29-diaseranes. The maturity parameters, TMNr, TeMNr and PMNr, MPI, Rc MDR and Rcs show a wide range of thermal maturities. Palli crude oil has the lowest maturity among the sample suit while condensates have highest maturity. A novel maturity parameter 4-MDBT/1,2,3,5,6-PMN has been proposed in this chapter which correlates very well with other established maturity parameters. Ternary plot of TMNr, TeMNr and PMNr reflects that majority of the analyzed crude oils are indigenous in nature with the exception of Palli, Pakhro and Sono which may have some in-reservoir mixing. Chapters 5-7 are dedicated to geochemical evaluation of sedimentary sequences: Ranikot (Paleocene); Laki (Eocene); Parh, Goru and Sembar (Cretaceous) and Datta and Chiltan (Jurassic) using Rock Eval and aliphatic and aromatic biomarkers. In chapter 5, aliphatic and aromatic biomarkers along with TOC and Rock Eval study have been used to evaluate geochemistry of sediments from Ranikot (Paleocene) and Laki (Eocene) Formations. Low values of Tmax, biomarkers and aromatics maturity parameters and high abundance of hopenes and AÂ¢AÂ¢-hopanes support highly immature nature of organic matter in both Laki and Ranikot sediments. Bimodal n-alkane distributions, marked predominance of C27, C29 and C31 n-alkanes, high abundance of C29 steranes compared to C27 and C28 homologues, presence of oleanene suggest that the organic matter in these sediments is predominantly of terrestrial origin, while cadalene and its intermediate like calamenene and tetrahydrocadalene specify drought resistant low land plants. The occurrence of C30 steranes and high concentration of fungal derived perylene supports the contribution of fungal organic matter and specific warm and humid climatic conditions supporting low land or marshy conifers on which wood degrading fungi flourish. It is most likely that raise in sea level and increased salinity sea waters may have inundated these low lands and shortage of oxygen and minerals resulted in death and preservation of fungal colonies along with wood debris. Marine anoxic to sub-oxic conditions (Pr/Ph 0.43-2.01) in water columns favored peryloquinones formation and finally conversion to perylene and preservation in Laki and Ranikot Formations in high abundance. A thin section within the Laki Formation (460-490 m) has mixed type II, III kerogen, reflected from HI: 224-540 mgHC/gTOC and Pr/n-C17 versus Ph/n-C18 plot. Therefore, despite good to excellent organic richness, these sediments are highly immature and far from hydrocarbons generation. The main objective of chapter 6 is geochemical characterization of Parh, Goru and Sembar Formations sediments using TOC, Rock Eval and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Most of the sediments of Parh, and Upper Goru Formations are lean in organic matter (TOC 435 Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¹C). The upper 430 m section of Sembar Formation shows high TOC (1-3.2 %) and maturity status from peak oil to overmature (Tmax: 442-487 oC), while lower 190 m including Jurassic sediments are poor to fair in organic matter (TOC: 0.5-1.5 %), however, Tmax mostly lies in the mature zone with the exception of some bottom sediments. S2/S3 values in the range of 0.06-9.35 suggest gas generation potential of Sembar Formation. Modified Van-Krevlen diagram and plot of Tmax versus TOC suggest type III kerogen in the Lower Goru and Sembar shales. Biomarker data support Rock Eval results. Molecular maturity parameters like MPI, Rc, MDR, Rcs, TMNr and TeMNr and plots of 20S/(20S+20R) versus AEâ€™Aâ‚¬AEâ€™Aâ‚¬/(AEâ€™Aâ‚¬AEâ€™Aâ‚¬+AEâ€™Ã‚?AEâ€™Ã‚?) for C29 steranes indicate low maturity of Parh, Upper Goru, Upper Shale and Lower section of Sembar Formation and medium to high maturity of Lower Shale, Talhar Shale and most of the samples of Sembar Formation. n-Alkanes distributions, sterane ternary plot, presence of retene, high abundance of 1,2,5-TMN and 1,2,5,6-TeMN suggest predominant contribution from terrestrial organic matter in Parh, Upper and Lower Goru Formations and mixed marine and terrestrial organic matter in Sembar Formation. Values of Pr/Ph, C35/C34, C31R/C30, C29/C30 hopanes suggest marine sub-oxic to oxic depositional environment for Parh, Upper Goru and Sembar Formations and oxic to sub-oxic nearshore marine or shallow marine environment for the Lower Goru Formation. Chapter 7 is dedicated to characterization of previously unexplored Jurassic sediments of Datta and Chiltan Formations. Maturity parameters, 20S/(20S+20R), AEâ€™Aâ‚¬AEâ€™Aâ‚¬/( AEâ€™Aâ‚¬AEâ€™Aâ‚¬+AEâ€™Ã‚?AEâ€™Ã‚?), 22S/(22S+22R), moretane/hopane, Ts/Ts+Tm, MPR-1, MPR-3, MPI, PhDBF, TrPr-1 and TrPr-2 reveal immature to early maturity status of Datta and comparatively higher maturity level of the Chiltan sediments. Palynological data by Ministry of Petroleum Pakistan on BB well show the presence of Cheirolepidiacean spore classes Classopollis torosus and Spheripollenite along with Araucariacites australis in Datta Formation which are important palynomorphs of conifers. Since conifers appeared in the fossil record of the Permian; it indicates coniferous source and Permian or younger age of sequence. A notable feature of both Datta and Chiltan sediments is the presence of relatively high proportions of alkylcyclohexanes and alkylcyclopentanes series. As these compounds are characteristic of marine organic sources, they provide an indication for the marine algal incursion for these Jurassic sediments. The major contribution of organic matter in Chiltan Formation is from terrestrial source shown by high abundance of C27, C29, C31 n-alkanes and C29 steranes and low sterane/hopane ratio, with some contribution from marine algal source as shown above. Datta Formation has mixed marine algal and terrestrial organic matter on the basis of high abundance of C16, C18, C20 n-alkanes, presence of C30 steranes, ratios of sterane/hopanes, tricyclicterpanes/hopanes and high abundances of alkylcyclohexanes and alkylcyclopentanes. The presence of coniferous spores and woody tissues in Datta Formation also support terrestrial organic matter input. Paleoclimatic interpretation of Datta Formation has been made on the basis of high abundance of combustion derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as a result of wild forest fires during Jurassic times. Classopollis torosus along with Spheripollenite which are associated with warm and humid climatic conditions may have initiated the wildfires and the subsequent deposition of pyrolytic aromatic hydrocarbons in these sediments. Presence of vitrinite and phenyl substituted aromatics like phenylnaphthalenes, phenyldibenzofurans and benzonaphthofurans also supports wild forest fires during deposition of Datta Formation. In chapter 8 diamondoid hydrocarbons have been proposed as maturity indicators of condensates. Both waxy and non-waxy condensates originated from terrestrial organic matter deposited under marine oxic conditions have been examined. High level of thermal maturity is indicated by the values of diamondoid based maturity parameters, like methyladamantane index ranging from 54.1-75.8 % and methyldiamantane index ranging from 34.9-56.3 % which corresponds to vitrinite reflectance 1.1-1.6 %. Methyladamantanes/adamantane 3.99-5.52 and methyldiamantanes/diamantane 2.16- 2.99 indicate non-biodegradation nature of these samples. The data are supported by absence of unresolved complex mixture (UCM).",2014,

J an 2 00 8 Near-ideal model selection by l 1 minimization,"We consider the fundamental problem of estimating the mean of a vector y = XÎ² + z, where X is an n Ã— p design matrix in which one can have far more variables than observations and z is a stochastic error termâ€”the so-called 'p > n' setup. When Î² is sparse, or more generally, when there is a sparse subset of covariates providing a close approximation to the unknown mean vector, we ask whether or not it is possible to accurately estimate XÎ² using a computationally tractable algorithm. We show that in a surprisingly wide range of situations, the lasso happens to nearly select the best subset of variables. Quantitatively speaking, we prove that solving a simple quadratic program achieves a squared error within a logarithmic factor of the ideal mean squared error one would achieve with an oracle supplying perfect information about which variables should be included in the model and which variables should not. Interestingly, our results describe the average performance of the lasso; that is, the performance one can expect in an overwhelming majority of cases where XÎ² is a sparse or nearly sparse superposition of variables, but not in all cases. Our results are nonasymptotic and widely applicable since they simply require that pairs of predictor variables be not overly collinear.",2008,
Robust estimation and variable selection in sufficient dimension reduction,"Dimension reduction and variable selection play important roles in high dimensional data analysis. Minimum Average Variance Estimation (MAVE) is an efficient approach among many others. However, because of the use of least squares criterion, MAVE is not robust to outliers in the dependent variable or errors with heavy tailed distributions. A robust extension of MAVE through modal regression is proposed. This new approach can adapt to different error distributions and thus brings robustness to the contamination in the response variable. The estimator is shown to have the same convergence rate as the original MAVE. Furthermore, the proposed method is combined with adaptive LASSO to select informative variables. The efficacy of this new solution is illustrated through simulation studies and a data analysis on Hong Kong air quality.",2017,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Regression methods for microarray data,"In the past decade, DNA and oligonucleotide microarray technology has been developed, allowing gene expression levels to be measured on a genome-wide scale. Use of this massive amount of molecular information appears to be promising for discovering genetic networks. Classification based on microarray experiments has been studied extensively. In comparison, microarray gene expression data has been analyzed less frequently in a regression set-up. From a statistical point of view, the challenge with analyzing microarray gene expression data is due to the very large number of genes, which far exceeds the sample size, i.e., the so-called â€œlarge p, small nâ€ scenario. The lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method is a promising regression method that incorporates automatic variable selection by imposing an L1 penalty on the regression coefficients. However the lasso method has its limitations in the â€œlarge p, small nâ€ scenario. When p > n, the lasso method can select up to n variables before it saturates. And the lasso method does not offer a â€œgrouped selectionâ€ effect. Therefore we propose two new methods, based on lasso, that are particularly suitable for microarray data regression analysis. The methods can produce sparse, interpretable regression models that relate clusters of co-expressed genes to a quantitative phenotype. Our methods are tested on simulated data sets as well as real microarray data sets. 
Besides the proposal of novel regression methods, we also propose quantitative definitions for evaluating the strength of the â€œgrouped variableâ€ effect in fitted regression models. The new definitions allow us to compare regression models quantitatively. We then discuss a need for supervised clustering of genes, that is, the phenotype ought to have an influence on how genes are clustered. One potential approach is to re-define the distances between pairs of genes by incorporating the phenotype into the definition of the new distance metric.",2005,
Identifying Groups of Strongly Correlated Variables through Smoothed Ordered Weighted L1-norms,"The failure of LASSO to identify groups of correlated predictors in linear regression has sparked significant research interest. Recently, various norms [1, 2] were proposed, which can be best described as instances of ordered weighted l1 norms (OWL) [3], as an alternative to l1 regularization used in LASSO. OWL can identify groups of correlated variables but it forces the model to be constant within a group. This artifact induces unnecessary bias in the model estimation. In this paper we take a submodular perspective and show that OWL can be posed as the LovÃ¡sz extension of a suitably defined submodular function. The submodular perspective not only explains the groupwise constant behavior of OWL, but also suggests alternatives. The main contribution of this paper is smoothed OWL (SOWL), a new family of norms, which not only identifies the groups but also allows the model to be flexible inside a group. We establish several algorithmic and theoretical properties of SOWL including group identification and model consistency. We also provide algorithmic tools to compute the SOWL norm and its proximal operator, whose computational complexity O(d log d) is significantly better than that of general purpose solvers in O(d log d). In our experiments, SOWL compares favorably with respect to OWL in the regimes of interest.

Retinoblastoma therapy delivers power of chemotherapy with surgical precision.,"lastmonthattheAmericanUrologicalAssociationâ€™s annual meeting, which compared surgery vs observation in men diagnosedintheearlyeraofwidespreadPSA testing (1994-2002), indicated that surgerydidnot significantly reducemortality compared with observation over 12 yearsinmenwithlowerPSAlevelsorlowrisk tumors.PIVOTfindingsdidsuggest a modest benefit from surgery for men with higher PSA levels (greater than 10) or high-risk tumors. Andrew Vickers, PhD, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in New York City, said that while he sees both sides of the controversy, he does think that what researchers have learned in the last 15 to 20 years could be put to use to make PSA screening work well. Among the useful things learned, he said, is that although people usually think of PSA as a diagnostic tool, PSA levels also have a prognostic value, a result he and others have demonstrated. His group found that the PSA level at age 60 years predicts the lifetime risk of metastasis and death from prostate cancer (Vickers AJ et al. BMJ. 2010: 341:c4521). A rational, evidence-based screening program for prostate cancer is possible, said Vickers. He proposes testing men at an early age, but not repeating the test annually in men with low readings and not performing a biopsy for a high level on a first reading because PSA levels fluctuate. For many men, with persistently high PSA levels, particularly older men, he suggests using active surveillance and sending those who would need to be treated immediately to high-volume centers, where outcomes for prostate surgery are better. â€œYou can push PSA testing,â€ said Vickers. â€œYou just have to do it in the right way.â€",2011,JAMA
Angiotensin converting enzymes in fish venom,"ABSTRACT Animal venoms are multifaceted mixtures, including proteins, peptides and enzymes produced by animals in defense, predation and digestion. These molecules have been investigated concerning their molecular mechanisms associated and possible pharmacological applications. Thalassophryne nattereri is a small venomous fish inhabiting the northern and northeastern coast of Brazil, and represents a relatively frequent cause of injuries. Its venom causes severe inflammatory response followed frequently by the necrosis of the affected area. Scorpaena plumieri is the most venomous fish in the Brazilian fauna and is responsible for relatively frequent accidents involving anglers and bathers. In humans, its venom causes edema, erythema, ecchymoses, nausea, vomiting, and syncope. Recently, the presence of a type of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the venom of Thalassophryne nattereri and Scorpaena plumieri, endemic fishes in northeastern coast of Brazil, has been described. The ACE converts angiotensin I (Ang I) into angiotensin II (Ang II) and inactivates bradykinin, there by regulating blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis, however, their function in these venoms remains an unknown. This article provides an overview of the current knowledge on ACE in the venoms of Thalassophryne nattereri and Scorpaena plumier.",2017,Toxicon
Statistical learning and selective inference.,"We describe the problem of ""selective inference."" This addresses the following challenge: Having mined a set of data to find potential associations, how do we properly assess the strength of these associations? The fact that we have ""cherry-picked""--searched for the strongest associations--means that we must set a higher bar for declaring significant the associations that we see. This challenge becomes more important in the era of big data and complex statistical modeling. The cherry tree (dataset) can be very large and the tools for cherry picking (statistical learning methods) are now very sophisticated. We describe some recent new developments in selective inference and illustrate their use in forward stepwise regression, the lasso, and principal components analysis.",2015,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Confidence sets based on penalized maximum likelihood estimators in Gaussian regression,"Confidence intervals based on penalized maximum likelihood estimators such as the LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and hard-thresholding are analyzed. In the known-variance case, the finite-sample coverage properties of such intervals are determined and it is shown that symmetric intervals are the shortest. The length of the shortest intervals based on the hard-thresholding estimator is larger than the length of the shortest interval based on the adaptive LASSO, which is larger than the length of the shortest interval based on the LASSO, which in turn is larger than the standard interval based on the maximum likelihood estimator. In the case where the penalized estimators are tuned to possess the `sparsity property', the intervals based on these estimators are larger than the standard interval by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, a simple asymptotic confidence interval construction in the `sparse' case, that also applies to the smoothly clipped absolute deviation estimator, is discussed. The results for the known-variance case are shown to carry over to the unknown-variance case in an appropriate asymptotic sense.",2008,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Using random subspace method for prediction and variable importance assessment in linear regression,A random subset method (RSM) with a new weighting scheme is proposed and investigated for linear regression with a large number of features. Weights of variables are defined as averages of squared values of pertaining t-statistics over fitted models with randomly chosen features. It is argued that such weighting is advisable as it incorporates two factors: a measure of importance of the variable within the considered model and a measure of goodness-of-fit of the model itself. Asymptotic weights assigned by such a scheme are determined as well as assumptions under which the method leads to consistent choice of significant variables in the model. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method behaves promisingly when its prediction errors are compared with errors of penalty-based methods such as the lasso and it has much smaller false discovery rate than the other methods considered.,2014,Comput.

Identification of Features for Profit Forecasting of Soccer Matches,"For the increase of profit in soccer clubs, it is crucial to understand which are the most relevant features that led to profitable soccer matches. The model aimed to identify the most important explanatory features to predict the profit of soccer matches, using databases from historical soccer matches of Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, as well as public data sets provided by Brazilian government agencies. We applied several classification algorithms to chose the ones that led to the highest ROC AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve). Then we performed feature selection algorithms: LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination), to highlight the relevant features from the data set. The top classifiers were Gradient Boosting and Random Forest, which resulted in ROC AUC of 0.860 and 0.842 respectively. The number of features selected by the LASSO and RFE was, respectively, 14 and 17, of which only 10 features were common for both selectors, and, thus chosen as the most important features.",2019,
The Body Pro: HIV JournalView August 2004,"To a great extent, the incidence of antiretroviral-related PN has been pegged to the popularity of the deoxynucleotide analogue agents -stavudine (d4T, Zerit), didanosine (ddI, Videx) and zalcitabine (ddC, Hivid); as use of these agents has waned, so too has the incidence of drugassociated PN. However, for various reasons, some patients still require these antiretrovirals. Therapy for painful PN has had limited success and there are no licensed effective therapies to date. Once the cornerstone of therapy, tricyclic antidepressants have given way to anticonvulsants such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). Yet, for many PN sufferers, these agents -even in combination with narcotic analgesics -provide less than complete relief and add additional pill burden to standard HIV regimens. Withdrawal of the offending antiretroviral is often possible, although, in some cases, there is the risk of loss of control of HIV viremia. Further, the heavy reliance on stavudine in the developing world insures that PN may become a major issue in the management of HIV in these areas. Therefore, an effective therapy for relief of antiretroviralassociated PN remains an important priority.",2004,

FRM Financial Risk Meter,"A systemic risk measure is proposed accounting for links and mutual dependencies between financial institutions utilising tail event information. FRM (Financial Risk Meter) is based on Lasso quantile regression designed to capture tail event co-movements. The FRM focus lies on understanding active set data characteristics and the presentation of interdependencies in a network topology. Two FRM indices are presented, namely, FRM@Americas and FRM@Europe. The FRM indices detect systemic risk at selected areas and identifies risk factors. In practice, FRM is applied to the return time series of selected financial institutions and macroeconomic risk factors. We identify companies exhibiting extreme ""co-stress"", as well as ""activators"" of stress. With the SRM@EuroArea, we extend to the government bond asset class, and to credit default swaps with FRM@iTraxx. FRM is a good predictor for recession probabilities, constituting the FRM-implied recession probabilities. Thereby, FRM indicates tail event behaviour in a network of financial risk factors.",2019,
Effects of image characteristics on the identification and extraction of archaeological features from Ikonos-2 and Quickbird-2 imagery: case study Sagalassos (southwest Turkey),"This paper compares and evaluates the significance of spectral characteristics and pixel resolution of the very high spatial resolution satellite systems (VHSRS) Quickbird-2 and Ikonos-2 for automatic extraction of ancient features on one archaeological site, the antique town Sagalassos (southwest-Turkey). The evaluation of the spectral characteristics is based on a band-by-band comparison. Pixel- and object-based classification techniques are compared with visual analyses to assess the effects of different image characteristics. The analysis reveals that Quickbird-2 is outperforming Ikonos-2 for the visual identification of ancient remains. Its augmented spatial resolution however does not necessarily result in a better automatic classification. For Sagalassos, maximum likelihood classification on Ikonos-2 gives the best results. The accuracy of automatic extraction depends on the type and characteristics of the VHSRS data, the classification method and on on-site parameters. Site characteristics appear to play a limited role in object-based extraction on Quickbird-2, but become very important on Ikonos-2.",2009,International Journal of Remote Sensing
Clinical grade vitrification of human ovarian tissue for fertility preservation,"Cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue is one approach to preserve fertility for women who can be predicted to undergo premature ovarian failure as a consequence of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or genetic disorders. It is the most suitable option for prepubertal girls and for many young women to store oocytes. To date, autotransplantation of frozenthawed cortical tissues has resulted in birth of 24 healthy children, worldwide. Cryopreservation can be performed using slow freezing or vitrification. Vitrification is known as solidification without formation of lethal intracellular ice crystals. The aim of this thesis was to further develop methods for cryopreserving follicles in human ovarian tissue of women who have a risk of losing their fertility. In the first study, we systematically compared two cryopreservation methods for human ovarian cortical tissue, slow freezing and vitrification. Cryoprotectants we used for slow freezing were either 1,2propanediol (PrOH)sucrose or ethylene glycol (EG)sucrose. For vitrification, we used solutions containing a combination of the cryoprotectants dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), PrOH, EG and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and postthaw tissue culture were carried out to evaluate the structure and the viability of the follicles. The follicles were well preserved and the ovarian stroma showed better morphological integrity after vitrification. In the second study, we developed a clinical grade vitrification of human ovarian tissue. Ovarian tissue was vitrified in a closed system without any direct contact with liquid nitrogen using a non-toxic and sterile cryotube. Vitrification solutions used contained a combination of cryoprotectants DMSO, PrOH, EG and PVP. The morphology of the follicles in the vitrified tissue, showed well -preserved structures as verified by LM, TEM and also after post -thaw culture. The system used is compatible with the European tissue directive and the Swedish tissue law. In the third article, we studied the occurrence of apoptosis in vitrified tissues. We used Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and DNA fragmentation analysis, which showed no incidence of apoptosis in follicles or stroma after using either vitrification solution (i.e., a combination of DMSO, PrOH, EG and PVP, or EG and bovine serum albumin (BSA). In the fourth one, we performed a study to simplify our earlier described closed vitrification procedure. Permeating cryoprotectants used in vitrification solutions consisted either of a combination of DMSO, PrOH, EG or EG only. Ovarian tissue was vitrified in closed sealed tubes containing either of the vitrification solutions. Morphological analysis (LM and TEM) showed that oocytes, granulosa cells and stroma were equally well preserved when either of the vitrification solutions was used. No apoptosis was observed in primordial and primary follicles using immunohistochemistry for active caspase3. Conclusion: Hereby we present new vitrification procedures that can be performed in a clinical setting. The morphology of follicles in the ovarian tissue as evaluated by using LM and TEM proved to be normal after the procedures. Ultra-structural analysis by TEM used in this study is the bestknown method to evaluate cryoinjury. We have developed a new effective clinical grade method for cryo-storage of human ovarian tissue.

Adaptive Multi-task Sparse Learning with an Application to fMRI Study,"In this paper, we consider the multi-task sparse learning problem under the assumption that the dimensionality diverges with the sample size. The traditional l1/l2 multi-task lasso does not enjoy the oracle property unless a rather strong condition is enforced. Inspired by adaptive lasso, we propose a multi-stage procedure, adaptive multi-task lasso, to simultaneously conduct model estimation and variable selection across different tasks. Motivated by adaptive elastic-net, we further propose the adaptive multi-task elastic-net by adding another quadratic penalty to address the problem of collinearity. When the number of tasks is fixed, under weak assumptions, we establish the asymptotic oracle property for the proposed adaptive multi-task sparse learning methods including both adaptive multitask lasso and elastic-net. In addition to the desirable asymptotic property, we show by simulations that adaptive sparse learning methods also achieve much improved finite sample performance. As a case study, we apply adaptive multi-task elastic-net to a cognitive science problem, where one wants to discover a compact semantic basis for predicting fMRI images. We show that adaptive multi-task sparse learning methods achieve superior performance and provide some insights into how the brain represents meanings of words.",2012,
Radiomics Analysis of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Prediction of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer,"Purpose: To investigate whether a combination of radiomics and automatic machine learning applied to dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of primary breast cancer can non-invasively predict axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis. Methods: 62 patients who received a DCE-MRI breast scan were enrolled. Tumor resection and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy were performed within 1 week after the DCE-MRI examination. According to the time signal intensity curve, the volumes of interest (VOIs) were delineated on the whole tumor in the images with the strongest enhanced phase. Datasets were randomly divided into two sets including a training set (~80%) and a validation set (~20%). A total of 1,409 quantitative imaging features were extracted from each VOI. The select K best and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) were used to obtain the optimal features. Three classification models based on the logistic regression (LR), XGboost, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were constructed. Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis was used to analyze the prediction performance of the models. Both feature selection and models construction were firstly performed in the training set, then were further tested in the validation set by the same thresholds. Results: There is no significant difference between all clinical and pathological variables in breast cancer patients with and without SLN metastasis (P > 0.05), except histological grade (P = 0.03). Six features were obtained as optimal features for models construction. In the validation set, with respect to the accuracy and MSE, the SVM demonstrated the highest performance, with an accuracy, AUC, sensitivity (for positive SLN), specificity (for positive SLN) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.85, 0.83, 0.71, 1, 0.26, respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of combining artificial intelligence and radiomics from DCE-MRI of primary tumors to predict axillary SLN metastasis in breast cancer. This non-invasive approach could be very promising in application.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Nonidentical twins: Comparison of frequentist and Bayesian lasso for Cox models.,"One important task in translational cancer research is the search for new prognostic biomarkers to improve survival prognosis for patients. The use of high-throughput technologies allows simultaneous measurement of genome-wide gene expression or other genomic data for all patients in a clinical trial. Penalized likelihood methods such as lasso regression can be applied to such high-dimensional data, where the number of (genomic) covariables is usually much larger than the sample size. There is a connection between the lasso and the Bayesian regression model with independent Laplace priors on the regression parameters, and understanding this connection has been useful for understanding the properties of lasso estimates in linear models (e.g. Park and Casella, 2008). In this paper, we study the lasso in the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks in the context of Cox models. For the Bayesian lasso we extend the approach by Lee et al. (2011). In particular, we impose the lasso penalty only on the genome features, but not on relevant clinical covariates, to allow the mandatory inclusion of important established factors. We investigate the models in high- and low-dimensional simulation settings and in an application to chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",2015,Biometrical journal. Biometrische Zeitschrift
Statistical and Computational Methods for Analyzing High-Throughout Genomic Data,"In the burgeoning field of genomics, high-throughput technologies (e.g. microarrays, next-generation sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry) have enabled biologists to perform global analysis on thousands of genes, mRNAs and proteins simultaneously. Extracting useful information from enormous amounts of high-throughput genomic data is an increasingly pressing challenge to statistical and computational science. In this thesis, I will address three problems in which statistical and computational methods were used to analyze high-throughput genomic data to answer important biological questions.The first part of this thesis focuses on addressing an important question in genomics: how to identify and quantify mRNA products of gene transcription (i.e., isoforms) from next-generation mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data? We developed a statistical method called Sparse Linear modeling of RNA-Seq data for Isoform Discovery and abundance Estimation (SLIDE) that employs probabilistic modeling and L1 sparse estimation to answer this ques- tion. SLIDE takes exon boundaries and RNA-Seq data as input to discern the set of mRNA isoforms that are most likely to present in an RNA-Seq sample. It is based on a linear model with a design matrix that models the sampling probability of RNA-Seq reads from different mRNA isoforms. To tackle the model unidentifiability issue, SLIDE uses a modified Lasso procedure for parameter estimation. Compared with existing deterministic isoform assembly algorithms, SLIDE considers the stochastic aspects of RNA-Seq reads in exons from different isoforms and thus has increased power in detecting more novel isoforms. Another advantage of SLIDE is its flexibility of incorporating other transcriptomic data into its model to further increase isoform discovery accuracy. SLIDE can also work downstream of other RNA-Seq assembly algorithms to integrate newly discovered genes and exons. Besides isoform discovery, SLIDE sequentially uses the same linear model to estimate the abundance of discovered isoforms. Simulation and real data studies show that SLIDE performs as well as or better than major competitors in both isoform discovery and abundance estimation.The second part of this thesis demonstrates the power of simple statistical analysis in correcting biases of system-wide protein abundance estimates and in understanding the rela- tionship between gene transcription and protein abundances. We found that proteome-wide surveys have significantly underestimated protein abundances, which differ greatly from previously published individual measurements. We corrected proteome-wide protein abundance estimates by using individual measurements of 61 housekeeping proteins, and then found that our corrected protein abundance estimates show a higher correlation and a stronger linear relationship with mRNA abundances than do the uncorrected protein data. To estimate the degree to which mRNA expression levels determine protein levels, it is critical to measure the error in protein and mRNA abundance data and to consider all genes, not only those whose protein expression is readily detected. This is a fact that previous proteome-widely surveys ignored. We took two independent approaches to re-estimate the percentage that mRNA levels explain in the variance of protein abundances. While the percentages estimated from the two approaches vary on different sets of genes, all suggest that previous protein-wide surveys have significantly underestimated the importance of transcription.In the third and final part, I will introduce a modENCODE (the Model Organism ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) project in which we compared developmental stages, tis- sues and cells (or cell lines) of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, two well-studied model organisms in developmental biology. To understand the similarity of gene expression patterns throughout their development time courses is an interesting and important question in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology. The availability of modENCODE RNA-Seq data for different developmental stages, tissues and cells of the two organisms enables a transcriptome-wide comparison study to address this question. We undertook a comparison of their developmental time courses and tissues/cells, seeking com- monalities in orthologous gene expression. Our approach centers on using stage/tissue/cell- associated orthologous genes to link the two organisms. For every stage/tissue/cell in each organism, its associated genes are selected as the genes capturing specific transcriptional activities: genes highly expressed in that stage/tissue/cell but lowly expressed in a few other stages/tissues/cells. We aligned a pair of D. melanogaster and C. elegans stages/tissues/cells by a hypergeometric test, where the test statistic is the number of orthologous gene pairs associated with both stages/tissues/cells. The test is against the null hypothesis that the two stages/tissues/cells have independent sets of associated genes. We first carried out the alignment approach on pairs of stages/tissues/cells within D. melanogaster and C. elegans respectively, and the alignment results are consistent with previous findings, supporting the validity of this approach. When comparing fly with worm, we unexpectedly observed two parallel collinear alignment patterns between their developmental timecourses and several interesting alignments between their tissues and cells. Our results are the first findings regarding a comprehensive comparison between D. melanogaster and C. elegans time courses, tissues and cells.",2013,
Patterns of chemical defense among Caribbean gorgonian corals: a preliminary survey,"Abstract Ship-board assays employing the common Caribbean wrasse Thalassoma bifasdatum (Bloch) were undertaken to determine the palatability of food pellets coated with freshly-extracted, lipid-soluble metabolites of 37 types of Caribbean gorgonian corals representing at least 19 species from 11 genera. Extracts of 19 types (51%) were highly unpalatable (zero or one of five pellets eaten), four types (11%) were moderately unpalatable (two or three of five pellets eaten) and 14 (38%) were palatable (four or five of five pellets eaten) to fish in feeding assays. Gorgonians of the genera Pterogorgia (three types) and Eunicea (nine types) were consistently highly unpalatable, those of the genus Plexaurella (four types) were palatable and those of the genus Plexaura were most frequently palatable (six of eight types). Further assays of serial dilutions of extracts from seven representative, unpalatable types revealed that extracts inhibited fish feeding at pellet concentrations near or below the concentrations that metabolites occur in the gorgonian soft tissue. Extracts of Erythropodium caribaeorum (Duchassaing and Michelotti) and Pseudopterogorgia rigida (Bielschowsky) deterred fish feeding at pellet concentrations less than an order of magnitude lower than those found in the soft tissues of the corresponding gorgonians. Thin layer chromatographic analyses of extracts revealed the presence of lipid-soluble, secondary metabolites in a majority of the highly unpalatable extracts, although secondary metabolites were also present in a smaller percentage of palatable extracts. These data support the hypothesis that the soft tissues of many gorgonian corals contain lipid-soluble feeding deterrents which act as a defense against predation.",1987,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology
An extended variable inclusion and shrinkage algorithm for correlated variables,"The problem of variable selection for linear regression in a high dimension model is considered. A new method, called Extended-VISA (Ext-VISA), is proposed to simultaneously select variables and encourage a grouping effect where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. Moreover, Ext-VISA is capable of selecting a sparse model while avoiding the overshrinkage of a Lasso-type estimator. It combines the idea of the VISA algorithm which avoids the overshrinkage problem of regression coefficients and those of the Lasso-type estimators, based on ? 1 + ? 2 penalty, that overcome the limitation of the grouping effect of Lasso in high dimension. It is based on a modified VISA algorithm, so it is also computationally efficient. Three interesting cases of Ext-VISA are examined. The first case is Smooth-VISA (SVISA), where the variations among successive regression coefficients are low. The second case is VISA-Net (VNET), where the correlations between predictors are taken into account. The third case is Laplacian-VISA (LVISA), where the predictors are measured on an undirected graph. A theoretical property on sparsity inequality of Ext-VISA is established. A detailed simulation study in small and high dimensional settings is performed, which illustrates the advantages of the new approach in relation to several other possible methods. Finally, we apply VNET, SVISA and LVISA to a GC-retention data set.",2013,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
An auxiliary function approach for Lasso in music composition using cellular automata,"In this paper, we present an auxiliary function approach to solve the overlap group Lasso problem. Our goal is to solve a more general structure with overlapping groups, which is suitable to be used in cellular automata (CA). The CA were introduced to the algorithmic composition which is based on the development and classification. At the same time, concrete algorithm and mapping from CA to music series are given. Experimental simulations show the effectiveness of our algorithms, and using the auxiliary function approach to solve Lasso with CA is a potentially useful music automatic-generation algorithm.",2014,Journal of Applied Statistics
Classification of Defoliated Trees Using Tree-Level Airborne Laser Scanning Data Combined with Aerial Images,"Climate change and rising temperatures have been observed to be related to the increase of forest insect damage in the boreal zone. The common pine sawfly (Diprion pini L.) (Hymenoptera, Diprionidae) is regarded as a significant threat to boreal pine forests. Defoliation by D. pini can cause severe growth loss and tree mortality in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) (Pinaceae). In this study, logistic LASSO regression, Random Forest (RF) and Most Similar Neighbor method (MSN) were investigated for predicting the defoliation level of individual Scots pines using the features derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and aerial images. Classification accuracies from 83.7% (kappa 0.67) to 88.1% (kappa 0.76) were obtained depending on the method. The most accurate result was produced using RF with a combination of data from the two sensors, while the accuracies when using ALS and image features separately were 80.7% and 87.4%, respectively. Evidently, the combination of ALS and aerial images in detecting needle losses is capable of providing satisfactory estimates for individual trees.",2010,Remote Sensing
Pancrustacean Evolution Illuminated by Taxon-Rich Genomic-Scale Data Sets with an Expanded Remipede Sampling,"The relationships of crustaceans and hexapods (Pancrustacea) have been much discussed and partially elucidated following the emergence of phylogenomic data sets. However, major uncertainties still remain regarding the position of iconic taxa such as Branchiopoda, Copepoda, Remipedia, and Cephalocarida, and the sister group relationship of hexapods. We assembled the most taxon-rich phylogenomic pancrustacean data set to date and analyzed it using a variety of methodological approaches. We prioritised low levels of missing data and found that some clades were consistently recovered independently of the analytical approach used. These include, for example, Oligostraca and Altocrustacea. Substantial support was also found for Allotriocarida, with Remipedia as the sister of Hexapoda (i.e., Labiocarida), and Branchiopoda as the sister of Labiocarida, a clade that we name Athalassocarida (=""non-marine shrimps""). Within Allotriocarida, Cephalocarida was found as the sister of Athalassocarida. Finally, moderate support was found for Hexanauplia (Copepoda as sister to Thecostraca) in alliance with Malacostraca. Mapping key crustacean tagmosis patterns and developmental characters across the revised phylogeny suggests that the ancestral pancrustacean was relatively short-bodied, with extreme body elongation and anamorphic development emerging later in pancrustacean evolution.",2019,Genome Biology and Evolution
"Eagle Mills Formation (triassic) from a Well in East-central Texas, U.s.a.","Well cuttings from the 8300-9500 ft (= 2530-2896 m) levels of the Hinton No. 1 Snider well in Falls County, east-central Texas, were studied palynologically. The cuttings were prevailingly gray to reddish-brown shales, and most samples were productive of palynomorphs. The undoubted indigenous palynoflora of the rock indicates late Carnian (Late Triassic) age for the Eagle Mills Formation, representing sedimentation in a Newark-Basins-style rift basin. The flora of most of the sampled interval was dominated by monosaccate and bisaccate conifer pollen and spores supporting late Carnian age. These forms also indicate relatively dry climatic conditions. Above 8650 ft the palynoflora is dominated by Corollina (al. Classopollis) pollen, and spores, indicating terminal Triassic to Early Jurassic age. However, the upper levels contain abundant dinoflagellates and spores and pollen of Jurassic to Late Cretaceous age, which clearly came from up-well caving. It is therefore probable that the post-Carnian indicators",2016,
Implementing machine learning in bipolar diagnosis in China,"Bipolar disorder (BPD) is often confused with major depression, and current diagnostic questionnaires are subjective and time intensive. The aim of this study was to develop a new Bipolar Diagnosis Checklist in Chinese (BDCC) by using machine learning to shorten the Affective Disorder Evaluation scale (ADE) based on an analysis of registered Chinese multisite cohort data. In order to evaluate the importance of each item of the ADE, a case-control study of 360 bipolar disorder (BPD) patients, 255 major depressive disorder (MDD) patients and 228 healthy (no psychiatric diagnosis) controls (HCs) was conducted, spanning 9 Chinese health facilities participating in the Comprehensive Assessment and Follow-up Descriptive Study on Bipolar Disorder (CAFÃ‰-BD). The BDCC was formed by selected items from the ADE according to their importance as calculated by a random forest machine learning algorithm. Five classical machine learning algorithms, namely, a random forest algorithm, support vector regression (SVR), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and logistic regression, were used to retrospectively analyze the aforementioned cohort data to shorten the ADE. Regarding the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), the BDCC had high AUCs of 0.948, 0.921, and 0.923 for the diagnosis of MDD, BPD, and HC, respectively, despite containing only 15% (17/113) of the items from the ADE. Traditional scales can be shortened using machine learning analysis. By shortening the ADE using a random forest algorithm, we generated the BDCC, which can be more easily applied in clinical practice to effectively enhance both BPD and MDD diagnosis.",2019,Translational Psychiatry
1 Our Approach : Spike-and-Slab Lasso Biclustering,"Biclustering methods aim to group samples using only subsets of their associated features. In this way, biclustering methods differ from traditional clustering methods, which utilize the entire set of features to group samples. Motivating applications for biclustering include genomics data, where the goal is to cluster patients or samples by their gene expression profiles; and recommender systems, which seek to group customers based on their product preferences. Biclusters of interest often manifest as rank1 submatrices of the data matrix. This submatrix detection problem can be viewed as a factor analysis problem in which both the factors and loadings are sparse. In this paper, we propose a new biclustering method called Spike-and-Slab Lasso Biclustering (SSLB) which utilizes the Spike-and-Slab Lasso of RoÄkovÃ¡ and George (2018) to find such a sparse factorization of the data matrix. SSLB also incorporates an Indian Buffet Process prior to automatically choose the number of biclusters. Many biclustering methods make assumptions about the size of the latent biclusters; either assuming that the biclusters are all of the same size, or that the biclusters are very large or very small. In contrast, SSLB can adapt to find biclusters which have a continuum of sizes. SSLB is implemented via a fast EM algorithm with a variational step. In a variety of simulation settings, SSLB outperforms other biclustering methods. We apply SSLB to both a microarray dataset and a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset and highlight that SSLB can recover biologically meaningful structures in the data. The SSLB software is available as an R/C++ package at https://github.com/gemoran/SSLB.",2019,
"1236 Migration of catheter in cancer patients with implantable access port system, treatment by percutaneous extraction","Complications due to subcutaneous devices are rare, mainly venous thrombosis, sepsis and uncommonly pneumothorax, but migration of the catheter has not been yet reported. In our institution about 820 subcutaneous central venous access devices for chemotherapy have been placed since 1985, mainly by a subclavicular access. We report here 2 cases of migrated catheters, (2.5/1000) one in both pulmonary arteries, the second in right ventricle and pulmonary artery, extracted by a non-invasive technique as out patients. Extraction of accidentally migrated catheters by lasso's technique is now well-known in vasculary radiology, and must be realized in a ward with continuous cardiologic survey and reanimation means. Catheter's crossing through the right ventricle composes the risk of this technique. Winding a â€œpig-tailâ€ catheter round the migrated catheter allows its mobilization and removing to the right auricle. In a second step, a strong gripping of the catheter by the lasso permits the final extraction without any cardiac risk.",1995,European Journal of Cancer
Deutsche Leitlinien zur Diagnostik des benignen Prostatasyndroms,"ZusammenfassungDie neue Version der deutschen Leitlinien zur Diagnostik des benignen Prostatasyndroms (BPS) der Deutschen Urologen wurde in den Jahren 2006 und 2007 von Experten des Arbeitskreises BPH erstellt und wird voraussichtlich im Jahr 2008 publiziert. In der neuen Leitlinienversion wurden die Methoden zur Diagnostik des BPS neu bewertet und aktualisiert. Als obligate Untersuchungen wurden Anamnese, SymptomfragebÃ¶gen, kÃ¶rperliche Untersuchung, Urinstatus, PSA, Uroflowmetrie, Sonographie der Harnblase (inkl. Restharnmessung) und die Sonographie des oberen Harntraktes bzw. Kreatininbestimmung aufgelistet. Fakultative Untersuchungen sind Miktionsprotokoll, Druck-Fluss-Studien, sonographische Detrusordickenmessung, Urethrozystographie und Urethrozystoskopie. Erstmals werden die Untersuchungen genannt, die zur Differenzialdiagnostik von Blasensymptomen und des BPS notwendig sind. Weiterhin wurden neue Erkenntnisse zum Progressionsrisiko des BPS, Indikationen zur urodynamischen Untersuchung und Beurteilung der Blasenauslassobstruktion mittels sonographischer Detrusordickenmessung aufgenommen. Alle Testverfahren wurden mit Evidenzlevel und Empfehlungsgrad anhand der Klassifikation des U.S. Department of Health and Human Services beurteilt, sodass die QualitÃ¤t der neuen Leitlinien zur Diagnostik des BPS deutlich verbessert wurde.AbstractThe new version of the German guidelines for assessing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was written in 2006 and 2007 by experts of the BPH working group on behalf of the German Association of Urology and Federation of German Urologists. The full version is expected to be published in 2008. Recommendations for assessing BPH were modified and updated and include patient history, symptom questionnaires, physical examination, urine analysis, prostate-specific antigen, uroflowmetry, ultrasound examination of the urinary bladder (including postvoid residual urine), and ultrasound examination of the upper urinary tract or creatinine measurement. Optional tests are voiding diary, pressure-flow studies, ultrasound measurement of detrusor wall thickness, urethrocystography, and urethrocystoscopy. For the first time, tests for the differential diagnosis of bladder symptoms and BPH are described. Furthermore, the latest knowledge was added on disease progression, indications for urodynamic assessment, and ultrasound measurement of detrusor wall thickness for evaluating bladder outlet obstruction. International quality standards were applied in order to increase the guidelinesâ€™ value; all tests were judged using the levels of evidence and grades of recommendation of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services classification.",2007,Der Urologe
Stochastic Parallel Block Coordinate Descent for Large-Scale Saddle Point Problems,"We consider convex-concave saddle point problems with a separable structure and non-strongly convex functions. We propose an efficient stochastic block coordinate descent method using adaptive primal-dual updates, which enables flexible parallel optimization for large-scale problems. Our method shares the efficiency and flexibility of block coordinate descent methods with the simplicity of primal-dual methods and utilizing the structure of the separable convex-concave saddle point problem. It is capable of solving a wide range of machine learning applications, including robust principal component analysis, Lasso, and feature selection by group Lasso, etc. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods in all these applications.",2016,
Novel insights into the morphology of Plesiochelys bigleri from the early Kimmeridgian of Northwestern Switzerland,"Plesiochelyidae were relatively large coastal marine turtles, which inhabited the epicontinental seas of Western Europe during the Late Jurassic. Their fossil record can be tracked in Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Portugal. The Jura Mountains, in northwestern Switzerland, have been the main source for the study of this group, mostly thanks to the rich and famous historical locality of Solothurn. In the last two decades, numerous plesiochelyid remains have been collected from Kimmeridgian deposits (Lower Virgula Marls and BannÃ© Marls) in the area of Porrentruy (Canton of Jura, Switzerland). This material was revealed by construction works of the A16 Transjurane highway between 2000 and 2011, and led to the recent description of the new species Plesiochelys bigleri. In the years 2014 and 2016, new fragmentary turtle material was collected from the BannÃ© Marls (Reuchenette Formation, lower Kimmeridgian) near the village of Glovelier, Canton of Jura, Switzerland. The new material consists of a complete shell, additional shell elements, a few bones from the appendicular and vertebral skeleton, and a fragmentary basicranium. This material can be confidently assigned to the species P. bigleri. It supports the presence of this species in the BannÃ© Marls, slightly extends its spatial distribution and confirms the differences with the closely related species P. etalloni. The new material reveals that the split between the cerebral and palatine branches of the internal carotid artery occurs in a vertical plane in P. bigleri. This condition could not be observed in the type material due to poor preservation. This new character clearly distinguishes P. bigleri from P. etalloni and seems to be unique among thalassochelydians.",2019,bioRxiv
PrevalenÃ§a d'enterobacteris amb sensibilitat reduÃ¯da a cefalosporines de tercera generaciÃ³ aÃ¯llades a l'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau entre 1994 i 2004,"La resistencia als antimicrobians es un proces natural, que com a consequencia del seu us ha afavorit la seleccio de mutants, ladquisicio de gens de resistencia i el sobrecreixement de bacteris intrinsecament resistents als antimicrobians.
Els s-lactamics son una de les families mes emprades en la practica clinica, essent el mecanisme enzimatic el mecanisme de resistencia mes important. En enterobacteris els enzims que prenen mes importancia son les s-lactamases despectre ampliat (BLEA) i les cefamicinases (pAMPCt).
Lobjectiu daquest treball fou determinar la prevalenca daquests enzims en els enterobacteris aillats a LHospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau en el periode compres entre 1994 i 2004.
Els estudis de sensibilitat en Escherichia coli i Klebsiella pneumoniae mostren un clar increment de la resistencia a cefalosporines de tercera generacio (C3G) i aztreonam, fruit duna major prevalenca de soques portadores de BLEA i pAMPCt. La prevalenca de soques productores de BLEA en el decenni 1994-2004 ha estat del 1,1% i del 1,6%, respectivament. Les BLEA mes frequents en E. coli han estat les del grup CTX-M (77,5%), essent lenzim CTX-M-9 el mes descrit (43%) mentre que en K. pneumoniae tant les BLEA del grup CTX-M com les SHV han tingut una prevalenca similar (50%). K. pneumoniae portador de BLEA ha estat, i encara es, majoritariament, un patogen nosocomial. En ambdues especies, les pAMPCt han presentat, respectivament, una prevalenca del 0,16%.i del 0,22% amb una clara presencia de soques portadores de CMY-2.
Els estudis de sensibilitat mostren que en les especies amb una s-lactamasa cromosomica induible tipus AmpC (Enterobacter, Citrobacter freundii i Morganella morganii) no hi ha hagut un increment de la resistencia a C3G, indicatiu duna possible desrepressio de lenzim, essent el percentatge de soques amb fenotip de desrepressio del voltant del 30% en Enterobacter i C. freundii i del 7,5% en M. morganii.
En Klebsiella oxytoca el principal mecanisme implicat es la hiperproduccio de llur s-lactamasa cromosomica que confereix resistencia a laztreonam. La prevalenca daquest mecanisme ha incrementat dun 4% a un 44%. Per altra banda, shan trobat dues soques productores de BLEA (CTX-M-9 i CTX-M-32).
En Proteus mirabilis, sha pogut observat al llarg dels deu anys un lleuger increment de la resistencia a lassociacio amoxicilÂ·lina-acid clavulanic i de manera puntual laparicio de soques productores de pAmpCt (tres soques amb CMY-2) o de BLEA (una soca amb CTX-M-1).
En Salmonella enterica cal destacar laillament de tres soques productores de BLEA (dues CTX-M-9 i una CTX-M-14) i una soca productora de CMY-2.
La resistencia a carbapenems ha estat practicament nulÂ·la en totes les especies estudiades. Malauradament, la resistencia als s-lactamics va associada a la resistencia a daltres families dantimicrobians. Les soques productores de BLEA presentaven uns percentatges de resistencia a fluoroquinolones, tetraciclina, trimetoprim-sulfametoxazol, cloramfenicol i aminoglicosids, del 84%, 56%, 52%, 35% i 14%, respectivament mentre que les soques productores de cefamicinasa presentaven uns percentatges de resistencia a cloramfenicol, fluoroquinolones, aminoglicosids, trimetoprim-sulfametoxazol i tetraciclina del 85%, 77%, 67%, 57%, i, 56%, respectivament. De lestudi de les resistencies associades dels antibiotics no s-lactamics a la produccio de BLEA o pAmpCt no sha obtingut un patro predominant associat a cada tipus de s-lactamasa.
Antimicrobial resistance is a natural process but the abuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents has favored the selection of mutants, the acquisition of resistance and the overgrowth of bacteria intrinsically resistant to these drugs. s-lactams (as cephalosporins) are one of the most widely used agents in clinical practice and their main mechanism of resistance by the bacteria is the production of enzymes known as s-lactamases. In Enterobacteriaceae, the Extended-Spectrum-s-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes (pAmpCt) are the most relevant of these enzymes.
The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and diversity of Extended-Spectrum-s-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes (pAmpCt) isolated from Enterobacteriaceae at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau between 1994 and 2004.
Results of the susceptibility studies in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed a clear increase in third generation cephalosporins (C3G) and aztreonam resistance due to a major prevalence of ESBLs- and pAmpCt-producing strains. The prevalence of ESBL-producing strains from 1994 to 2004 was between 1.11% and 1.6%. In E. coli, the ESBL CTX-M-type was the most frequent (77.5%) due to CTX-M-9-producing strains (43%). In K. pneumoniae, the CTX-M-type as well as the SHV-type had the same prevalence (50%). The prevalence of pAmpC-t in both species increased from 0.16% to 0.22%, with a clear presence of the CMY-2 enzyme.
We did not observe an increase in C3G resistance in the chromosomally-depressed AmpC beta-lactamase-producing strains such as Enterobacter, Citrobacter freundii or Morganella morganii. Prevalence was about 30% in Enterobacter and C. freundii and 7.5% in M. morganii.
In Klebsiella oxytoca, the main mechanism involved in s-lactam resistance was the depression of its chromosomal s-lactamase, observable because the strains become resistant to aztreonam. The prevalence of this mechanism increased from 4 to 44%. We also found two ESBL-producing strains (CTX-M-9 and CTX-M-32).
In Proteus mirabilis, we isolated one ESBL-producing strain (CTX-M-1), and observed a slight increase in coamoxiclav resistance due to three CMY-2 producing strains.
In Salmonella enterica three ESBL- producing strains (two CTX-M-9 and one CTX-M-14) and one CMY-2-producing strain were found.
s-lactam resistance was associated with other antimicrobial drug resistance. ESBL-producing strains showed rates of resistance to fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol and aminoglycosides of 84%, 56%, 52%, 35% and 14%, respectively. pAmpCt-producing strains showed rates of resistance to chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole of 85%, 77%, 67%, 57% and 56%, respectively. No predominant pattern was associated to s-lactams resistance in ESBL or pAmpCt-producing strains.",2007,
"Biochemical, microbial and processing study of dÃ¨guÃ¨ a fermented food (from pearl millet dough) from Burkina Faso.","Degue was a traditional fermented food (pearl millet dough) which consumed in Burkina Faso. In this work, the traditional processing of pearl millet into degue was investigated in 18 traditional production units. This study was followed in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. The main steps of diagram of production were dehulling, winnowing, washing, drying, milling, sieving, kneading, cooking, pounding, shaping and fermentation. Before fermentation, crude protein, crude fat, ash, starch and carbohydrates content were respectively 5.43; 3.00; 1.13; 33.37 and 41.81 %. After 72 hours of fermentation only protein content (6.12 %) was increased; starch content was(23.6 %) decreased. pH and titratable acidity were respectively 6.75 and 0.12 before the fermentation and after 72 hours pH (4.49) was decreased and titratable acidity (0.57 g of 100 grams of lactic acid) was increased. Microbiology analyses indicated that the number of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and moulds increased during the course of fermentation. The number of coliforms was decreased slightly after 72 hours of fermentation.",2009,Pakistan Journal of Nutrition
Recurrent neural networks for real-time prediction of TBM operating parameters,"Abstract With tunnel boring machines (TBMs) widely used in tunnel construction, the adaptable adjustment of TBM operating status has become a research focus. Since the prediction of tunnel geological conditions is still challenging before excavation, the prediction of important TBM operating parameters plays an important role in the research on TBM adaptable adjustment. In this paper, we use three kinds of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including traditional RNNs, long-short term memory (LSTM) networks and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks, to deal with the real-time prediction of TBM operating parameters based on TBM in-situ operating data. The experimental results show that the proposed three kinds of RNN-based predictors can provide accurate prediction values of some important TBM operating parameters during next period including the torque, the velocity, the thrust and the chamber pressure. We also make a comparison with several classical regression models (e.g., support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF) and Lasso) which actually cannot act as real-time predictors in a real sense, and the comparative experiments show that the proposed RNN-based predictors outperform the regression models in most cases. The feasibility of RNNs for the real-time prediction of TBM operating parameters indicates that RNNs can afford the analysis and the forecasting of the time-continuous in-situ data collected from various construction equipments.",2019,Automation in Construction
Analysis and design of circular plates using the workhardening adaptation criterion,"SommarioSi studiano l'analisi (determinazione del moltiplicatore al collasso) ed il progetto ottimale di piastre radialsimmetriche di materiale rigido-plastico, assumendo come criterio base l'adattamento per incrudimento ed utilizzando un modello continuo. I carichi sono variabili in modo quasistatico all'interno di un dato dominio. In tale studio si riconosce il ruolo cruciale giocato dalla valutazione dell'entitÃ  delle deformazioni plastiche, sviluppate durante la (incognita) storia di carico reale, deformazioni che possono risultare eccessive rispetto a certi requisiti, anche in presenza di adattamento. Viene quindi ricercata una maggiorazione a priori delle deformazioni e si perviene ad una forma di tipo non lineare; il vincolo non lineare che ne scaturisce viene sdoppiato in due vincoli piÃ¹ semplici ad esso equivalenti. La formulazione del problema di analisi si identifica in un problema lineare di massimo vincolato. La formulazione del problema di progetto si identifica in un problema di minimo vincolato, con funzione obiettivo e vincoli non lineari, ma facilmente linearizzabili. Si studiano anche le condizioni di ottimalitÃ  del problema di progetto. Una applicazione conclude il lavoro.SummaryA unified approach to both analysis (maximum load multiplier) and optimal design problems for workhardening adaptation of axialsimmetric plates is presented, via a continuous approach. The loads are assumed to arbitrarily vary but in a quasi-static manner and remaining inside a given convex loading domain. In such a framework, the assessment of the plastic deformations developed during the actual (a priori unknown) loading history is crucial, since these deformations may result to be excessive with respect to some given ductility criteria, eventhough workhardening adaptation has occured. The bounds on plastic deformations are formulated by means of a quadratic but convex function depending on some fictitious plastic strain. The nonlinear mathematical programming problem so obtained is linearized by a suitable decomposition of the nonlinear constraint into two equivalent constraints. The analysis problem is identified as a linear constrained maximization problem. The optimal design problem in the presence of limited ductility constraints, is identified as a nonlinear constrained minimization problem, the nonlinearity being due to both the objective function and to one only of the constraints: the latter however are herein shown to be suitably linearized. The optimality conditions of the mathematical programming problem are also studied and discussed, and the theory is applied to a case-study structure.",1984,Meccanica
Evaluation of urban solid wastes composts quality in Bobo-Dioulasso city Burkina Faso for best efficient use in agriculture.,"Objective: To evaluate urban solid waste composts quality of Bobo-Dioulasso for use as organic fertilizer. Methodology and results: Three types of composts were characterized and, a phytotoxicity test employing maize and groundnut seeds germination was carried out. The criteria used to assess compost quality were: maturity, particle size and foreign matter, nutrients, trace elements and pathogens. The germination rates of maize and groundnut were 90-100% which indicates that the compost was well matured. The C/N ratio varying between 10 to 13 support this result. The fines particles fraction â‰¤ 2 mm accounted for about 65% Journal of Applied Biosciences 33: 2076 2083",2010,Journal of Applied Biosciences
Cryoballoon temperature predicts acute pulmonary vein isolation.,"BACKGROUND
Cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) currently requires a long cryoballoon application (CBA) time of 240 to 300 seconds, thus repeated ineffective CBA prolongs procedure duration. We hypothesized that cryoballoon temperature (CBT) may be used to discriminate between effective and ineffective CBA during freezing.


OBJECTIVE
This study sought to evaluate CBT as a predictor of CBA efficiency.


METHODS
Sixty-six patients with atrial fibrillation underwent PVI using the single big (28 mm) cryoballoon technique. CBT was continuously recorded. After each CBA (300 seconds), a Lasso catheter (Biosense Webster, Inc., Diamond Bar, California) was placed into the target pulmonary vein (PV) to determine whether electrical PV disconnection was present. Only the first CBA at each PV was analyzed to avoid cumulative effects.


RESULTS
The CBT was lower during CBA at superior compared with inferior PVs. When individual CBAs were grouped according to successful/failed PVI, CBT was lower for those CBAs that resulted in successful PVI at all time points analyzed. To test the performance of CBT to predict failed CBA, receiver-operator curves were constructed. A minimal CBT of â‰¥ -42Â°C/ -39Â°C (superior/inferior PVs) predicted failed PVI with 73%/92% specificity (area under the curve 0.82/0.81); positive predictive value (PPV) 74%/74%. A minimal CBT of < -51Â°C was invariably associated with PVI. After 120 seconds of freezing, a CBT of â‰¥ -36Â°C/ -33Â°C (superior/inferior PVs) predicted failed PVI with 97%/95% specificity (area under the curve 0.82/0.76); PPV 82%/80%.


CONCLUSION
Balloon temperature predicts successful target PVI during cryoablation and may serve in the early identification of noneffective balloon applications.",2011,Heart rhythm
Network constrained covariate coefficient and connection sign estimation,"Often, variables are linked to each other via a network. When such a network structure is known, this knowledge can be incorporated into regularized regression settings. In particular, an additional network penalty can be added on top of another penalty term, such as a Lasso penalty. However, when the type of interaction via the network is unknown (that is, whether connections are of an activating or a repressing type), the connection signs have to be estimated simultaneously with the covariate coefficients. This can be done with an algorithm iterating a connection sign estimation step and a covariate coefficient estimation step. We show detailed simulation results of such an algorithm. The algorithm performs well in a variety of settings. We also briefly describe the R-package that we developed for this purpose, which is publicly available.",2018,

Efficient and Robust Recovery of Sparse Signal and Image Using Generalized Nonconvex Regularization,"This paper addresses the robust reconstruction problem of a sparse signal from compressed measurements. We propose a robust formulation for sparse reconstruction that employs the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _1$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm as the loss function for the residual error and utilizes a generalized nonconvex penalty for sparsity inducing. The <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _1$</tex-math></inline-formula> -loss is less sensitive to outliers in the measurements than the popular <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX""> $\ell _2$</tex-math></inline-formula>-loss, while the nonconvex penalty has the capability of ameliorating the bias problem of the popular convex LASSO penalty and thus can yield more accurate recovery. To solve this nonconvex and nonsmooth minimization formulation efficiently, we propose a first-order algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers. A smoothing strategy on the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _1$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-loss function has been used in deriving the new algorithm to make it convergent. Further, a sufficient condition for the convergence of the new algorithm has been provided for generalized nonconvex regularization. In comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms, the new algorithm showed better performance in numerical experiments in recovering sparse signals and compressible images. The new algorithm scales well for large-scale problems, as often encountered in image processing.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging
Using Penalized Regression to Uncover Peer Effects in the Spatial Autoregressive Model,"We propose a technique for estimating the spatial weights matrix (SWM) of the spatial autoregressive model (SAR) using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), first proposed by Tibshirani (1996). The SWM is typically assumed a priori as a known matrix of correlations among spatially correlated data, as it cannot be estimated using standard techniques due to overfitting. However, we use the Lasso to discover the most prominent spatial coefficients in the SWM and estimate them using feasible generalized least squares, while setting the relatively unimportant effects to zero. Furthermore, the Lasso solutions are optimized to minimize mean squared error over a grid of possible spatial lag parameters. Finally, we use the LARS-Lasso algorithm to compute an illustrative example of the technique. Acknowledgments. I would like to to thank Dr. Martins-Filho for his unrelenting patience and guidance through this process. His input has been essential to this thesis. I would also like to thank Dr. Kleiber for introducing me to spatial statistics and Dr. Flores for organizing the honor's seminar where I was able to present my work.

Comparative proteomics of lowdensity lipoprotein from normal weight and obese adults,"A proteomic approach was applied to examine the protein composition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in humans. LDL and HDL were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation, and proteins were separated with twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and identified with peptide mass fingerprinting, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and with amino acid sequencing using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. To improve the identification of low abundant proteins in silver stained 2-DE gels, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was used instead of Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix in the peptide mass fingerprinting procedure; this was demonstrated to give more matching peptide peaks, higher sequence coverage, and higher signal to noise ratio. Altogether 18 different proteins were demonstrated in LDL and/or HDL: three of these (calgranulin A, lysozyme C and transthyretin) have not been identified in LDL before. Apo C-II, apo C-III, apo E, apo A-I, apo A-IV, apo J, apo M, serum amyloid A-IV and Î±1-antitrypsin were found in both LDL and HDL, while apo B-100 (clone), calgranulin A, lysozyme C and transthyretin were found only in LDL, and apo A-II, apo C-I, and serum amyloid A only in HDL. Salivary Î±-amylase wass identified only in HDL2, and apo L and glycosylated apo A-II only in HDL3. Many of the proteins occurred in a number of isoforms: in all, 47 different isoform identities were demonstrated. A 2-DE mobility shift assay and deglycosylation experiments were used to demonstrate, for the first time, that apo M in LDL and HDL occurs in five isoforms; three that are both N-glycosylated and sialylated, one that is N-glycosylated but not sialylated and one that is neither N-glycosylated nor sialylated. LDL from obese subjects was found to contain more apo J, apo C-II, apo M, Î±1-antitrypsin and serum amyloid A-IV than LDL from controls,, and also more of an acidic isoform (pI/Mr; 5.2 / 23 100) of apo A-I. In addition, the new LDLassociated protein transthyretin, was found to be significantly more abundant in LDL from obese subjects. On the other hand, the amounts of apo A-IV and the major isoform of apo A-I (pI/Mr; 5.3 / 23 100) were significantly less. Altogether, these findings (i) illustrate the power of 2-DE and mass spectrometry for detailed mapping of the proteins and their isoforms in human lipoproteins; (ii) demonstrate the presence of a number of new proteins in LDL (calgranulin A, lysozyme C and transthyretin); (iii) give precise biochemical clues to the polymorphism of apo M in LDL and HDL, and; (iv) indicate that obesity is associated with significant changes in the protein profile of LDL. It is concluded that new information on lipoproteins can easily be obtained through a proteomic approach, thus facilitating the development of a new proteomic field: lipoproteomics. Much further investigation in this field is warranted, particularly because newly discovered LDL and HDL proteins may play hitherto unknown role(s) in inflammatory reactions of the arterial wall and evolve as useful biomarkers in cardiovascular disease.",2007,
Development and validation of a novel predictive score for sepsis risk among trauma patients,"BackgroundPatients suffering from major trauma often experience complications such as sepsis. The early recognition of patients at high risk of sepsis after trauma is critical for precision therapy. We aimed to derive and validate a novel predictive score for sepsis risk using electronic medical record (EMR) data following trauma.Materials and methodsClinical and laboratory variables of 684 trauma patients within 24â€‰h after admission were collected, including 411 patients in the training cohort and 273 in the validation cohort. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique was adopted to identify variables contributing to the early prediction of traumatic sepsis. Then, we constructed a traumatic sepsis score (TSS) using a logistic regression model based on the variables selected in the LASSO analysis. Moreover, we evaluated the discrimination and calibration of the TSS using the area under the curve (AUC) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) goodness-of-fit test.ResultsBased on the LASSO, seven variables (injury severity score, Glasgow Coma Scale, temperature, heart rate, albumin, international normalized ratio, and C-reaction protein) were selected for construction of the TSS. Our results indicated that the incidence of sepsis after trauma increased with an increasing TSS (Ptrendâ€‰=â€‰7.44â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’21 for the training cohort and Ptrendâ€‰=â€‰1.16â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’13 for the validation cohort). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of TSS were 0.799 (0.757â€“0.837) and 0.790 (0.736â€“0.836) for the training and validation datasets, respectively. The discriminatory power of our model was superior to that of a single variable and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Moreover, the TSS was well calibrated (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05).ConclusionsWe developed and validated a novel TSS with good discriminatory power and calibration for the prediction of sepsis risk in trauma patients based on the EMR data.",2019,World Journal of Emergency Surgery : WJES
Semi-Supervised Learning Using Sparse Eigenfunction Bases,"We present a new framework for semi-supervised learning with sparse eigenfunction bases of kernel matrices. It turns out that when the cluster assumption holds, that is, when the high density regions are sufï¬ciently separated by low density valleys, each high density area corresponds to a unique representative eigenvector. Linear combination of such eigenvectors (or, more precisely, of their Nystrom extensions) provide good candidates for good classiï¬cation functions. By ï¬rst choosing an appropriate basis of these eigenvectors from unlabeled data and then using labeled data with Lasso to select a classiï¬er in the span of these eigenvectors, we obtain a classiï¬er, which has a very sparse representation in this basis. Importantly, the sparsity appears naturally from the cluster assumption. Experimental results on a number of real-world datasets show that our method is competitive with the state of the art semi-supervised learning algorithms and out-performs the natural base-line algorithm (Lasso in the Kernel PCA basis).",2009,
"Thalassobius abyssi sp. nov., a marine bacterium isolated from cold-seep sediment.","A novel marine bacterial strain, designated JAMH 043T, was isolated from cold-seep sediment in Sagami Bay, Japan. Cells were Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, non-motile and aerobic chemo-organotrophs. The isolate grew optimally at 25â€‰Â°C, at pHâ€‰7.0-7.5 and with 3â€‰% (w/v) NaCl. The major respiratory quinone was ubiquinone-10 (Q-10). The predominant fatty acid was C18â€‰:â€‰1Ï‰7c. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the isolated strain was closely affiliated to members of the genus Thalassobius in the class Alphaproteobacteria, and 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of the novel isolate with the type strain of its closest related species, Thalassobius aestuarii JC2049T, was 98.4â€‰%. The DNA G+C content of the novel strain was 58.0â€Šmol%. The hybridization values for DNA-DNA relatedness between strain JAMH 043T and reference strains belonging to the genus Thalassobius were less than 14.1â€‰Â±â€‰2.2â€‰%.

Forecasting the Distribution of Economic Variables in a Data-Rich Environment,"This article investigates the relevance of considering a large number of macroeconomic indicators to forecast the complete distribution of a variable. The baseline time series model is a semiparametric specification based on the quantile autoregressive (QAR) model that assumes that the quantiles depend on the lagged values of the variable. We then augment the time series model with macroeconomic information from a large dataset by including principal components or a subset of variables selected by LASSO. We forecast the distribution of the h-month growth rate for four economic variables from 1975 to 2011 and evaluate the forecast accuracy relative to a stochastic volatility model using the quantile score. The results for the output and employment measures indicate that the multivariate models outperform the time series forecasts, in particular at long horizons and in tails of the distribution, while for the inflation variables the improved performance occurs mostly at the 6-month horizon.

Can we transform logic programs into attribute grammars?,"In this paper we study the relationship between Attribute Grammars and Logic Programs,concentrating on transforming logic programs into attribute grammars. Thishas potential applications in compilation techniques for logic programs. It does notseem possible to transform arbitrary Logic Programs into Attribute Grammars, basicallybecause the same logic variables can sometimes be used as input and sometimes asoutput. We introduce the notion of an Abstract Attribute Grammar, which is similar tothat of an Attribute Grammar with the exception that attributes are not classified intoinherited and synthesized, and that the semantic equations are replaced by restrictionsets. These sets represent a restriction on the values of attribute occurrences namely,all elements within each set have to be equal. We give an effective translation schemawhich produces an equivalent Abstract Attribute Grammar for a given Logic Program.We provide a formal proof of this equivalence. We then proceed to classify a classof Abstract Attribute Grammars that can be transformed into Attribute Grammars,and show how to achieve this transformation. By composing both transformations onecan transform certain logic programs into attribute grammars. Complete proofs ar5egiven.",1991,ITA
Assessment and relevance of the putative DNA/RNA helicase Schlafen-11 in ovarian and breast cancer,"Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) is a putative DNA/RNA helicase, first described for its role in thymocyte development and differentiation in mouse models. SLFN11 is part of a family of proteins with various degree of homology across species, but intriguingly being consistently present only in vertebrates and especially in mammals. Recently, the role of this putative DNA/RNA helicase, SLFN11, was causally associated with sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, such as platinum salts, topoisomerase I and II inhibitors, and other alkylators in the NCI-60 panel of cancer cell lines. In the first study, we validate an anti-SLFN11 antibody in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) samples, developing an immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocol in order to determinate the expression of SLFN11 in our series of HGSOC. Indeed, we tested and validated a reliable SLFN 11 antibody (Ab) in IHC choosing between two anti-SLFN11 Ab used normally for Western Blot (WB) in culture cell block (CCB) of ovarian carcinoma and in an independent series of HGSOCs tissue micro-array (TMA). For each case, we evaluated both the Intensity Score (IS) and the Distribution Score (DS) evaluating at least 300 cells. A Histological Score (HS)was obtained as follow: HS=IS x DS. Successively, we applied our protocol to a large case series of HGSOC samples to confirm our preliminary results. We found one antibody to be reliable in CCB and TMA series allowing to determinate clearly IHC expression of SLFN11. These results were confirmed in our large case series of FFPE HGSOC samples. Briefly, as for TMA independent series, we found that the HS for SLFN11 expression presents a normal distribution with a prevalent (â‰ˆ 60%) intermediate expression. Parallel SLFN11 was not expressed in practically 40% of cases that clinically corresponded to the platinum resistant patients in about 60% of cases (16/27). So, we believe that low IHC expression of SLFN 11 should be correlated to response to the platinum-based chemotherapy. In the second study, we investigate the transcriptional landscape of SLFN11 in breast cancer performing a gene expression microarray meta-analysis of more than 7000 cases from 35 publicly available data sets. By correlation analysis, we identified 537 transcripts in the top 95th percentile of Pearsonâ€™s coefficients with SLFN11 identifying â€œimmune responseâ€, â€œlymphocyte activationâ€ and â€œT cell activationâ€ as top Gene Ontology enriched processes. Furthermore, we reported very strong association of SLFN11 with immune signatures in breast cancer through penalized maximum likelihood lasso regression. Finally, through multiple corresponded analysis we discovered a subgroup of patients, defined â€œSLF11-hot clusterâ€, characterized by high SLFN11 levels, estrogen receptor(ER) negativity, basal-like phenotype, elevated CD3D, STAT1 signature, and young age. Using Cox proportional hazard regression, we characterized that SLFN11 high levels, high proliferation index, and ER negativity are independent parameters for longer disease-free interval in patients undergoing chemotherapy. We believe that our second work supports proof of concept that: i) A clear and specific role for SLFN11 in breast cancer, in likely connection with the immune system modulation in such disease entity, ii) a strong correlation between high SFLN 11 and specific molecular subtype of breast cancer (estrogen receptor negativity, basal-like phenotype). Further studies will be performed to confirm our hypothesis in order to: 1) better understand the function of SLFN 11 in cancer cell, 2) validate an easy, reliable and standardized IHC protocol to assessment SLFN11, 3) use SFLN11expression as a predictive biomarker of response to DDA and PARP inhibitors and 4) determinate the relationship with immune system",2019,

Foraging strategies of Antarctic Fulmarine petrels,"During breeding, procellariiform seabirds are typical central-place foragers, depending on distant pelagic resources. Especially in polar environments, where there is only a short time window to complete the breeding season, high chick provisioning rates are needed to allow chicks to fledge successfully. The duration of the chick period and of chick growth are linked to provisioning parameters such as the frequency and quantity of the chick meals, but probably also to the quality of the food delivered. We studied the provisioning and growth of chicks of Southern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides and Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica on Ardery Island (66Â°S, 110Â°E) near the Australian Antarctic station Casey. During two seasons (1998, 1999) we deployed artificial nests to collect data on chick provisioning. Southern Fulmars delivered meals more frequently (one per 14 hours) than did Antarctic Petrels (one every 25-26 hours). In 1998, the mass of meals brought to chicks of both species was not significantly different and averaged around 128 g. In 1999, the meal mass of Southern Fulmars remained the same, but that of the Antarctic Petrel was 28 g heavier. Chick provisioning rates calculated from meal frequencies and masses were significantly different between Southern Fulmars (254 g/day) and Antarctic Petrels (151 g/day), even after correction for body size. Because growth rates for the two species were not significantly different we suggest that Antarctic Petrels deliver meals of higher nutritional value, probably related to food reaching a higher density in the parents' stomach during their longer foraging trips.",2010,Marine ornithology

Group-level support recovery guarantees for group lasso estimator,"This paper considers the problem of estimating an unknown high dimensional signal from (typically low-dimensional) noisy linear measurements, where the desired unknown signal is assumed to possess a group-sparse structure, i.e. given a (pre-defined) partition of its entries into groups, only a small number of such groups are non-zero. Assuming the unknown group-sparse signal is generated according to a certain statistical model, we provide guarantees under which it can be efficiently estimated via solving the well-known group Lasso problem. In particular, we demonstrate that the set of indices for non-zero groups of the signal (called the group-level support of the signal) can be exactly recovered by solving the proposed group Lasso problem provided that its constituent non-zero groups are small in number and possess enough energy. Our guarantees rely on the well-conditioning of measurement matrix, which is expressed in terms of the block coherence parameter and can be efficiently computed. Our results are non-asymptotic in nature and therefore applicable to practical scenarios.",2017,"2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"

Effects of Multicollinearity in All Possible Mixed Model Selection,"The effects of multicollinearity in all possible model selection of fixed effects including quadratic and cross products in the presence of random and repeated measures effects are presented here. The user-friendly SAS macro application ALLMIXED2 complements the model selection option currently available in the SAS macro applications â€˜REGDIAGâ€™ and â€˜LOGISTICâ€™ for multiple linear and logistic regressions respectively. Options are also available in this macro to select the best covariance structure associated with the user-specified fully saturated repeated measures model; to graphically explore and to detect statistical significance of user specified linear, quadratic, interaction terms for fixed effects; and to diagnose multicollinearity, via the VIF statistic for each continuous predictors involved in each model selection step. The effects multicollinarity and sample size in pre-screening the variables in GLMSELECT using the LASSO selection method and in all possible subset selection within user-specified subset range are investigated using simulated repeated measures data with time independent auto-correlated error structure. A combination of two sample sizes (25 and 100 subjects) and two levels of mulicollinarity ( r < 0.2 and r > 0.8) among selected covariates were used in simulating 4 repeated measures data sets. Two model selection criteria, AICC (corrected Akaike Information Criterion) and MDL (minimal description length) were used in all possible model selection and summaries of the best model selection are compared graphically. The outcome of the model selection based on information criteria (AICC or MDL) was not influenced by the degree of multicollinarity. However, the sample size had a major impact on the accuracy of best candidate model selection.

Management of benign biliary strictures with a novel retrievable self-expandable metal stent.,"OBJECTIVE
Endoscopic placement of covered self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) has gained popularity in the management of benign biliary strictures (BBS). The existing SEMS has been designed primarily to palliate malignant biliary obstruction and has a high frequency of stent migration, difficulty in retrieval and stricture recurrence after stent removal. This study aimed to design a novel retrievable SEMS dedicated to the treatment of extrahepatic BBS and evaluate its clinical efficacy and safety.


METHODS
A short fully covered SEMS (FCSEMS) with a retrieval lasso was designed for the specific treatment of BBS. A total of 45 patients with segmental extrahepatic BBS were included in this study. The stent was placed entirely inside the bile duct with only the retrieval lasso extending from the papilla. The stents were recommended to be in situ for 6 to 12 months before removal.


RESULTS
The FCSEMS was successfully placed in all 45 patients. In all, 33 patients had their FCSEMS successfully removed after a mean period of 8.6 Â± 3.7 (range 2-15.5) months. Stent migration occurred in 9.1% of the patients. During a mean follow-up of 18.9 months after stent removal, recurrent stricture was found in 2 (6.1%) patients and was successfully treated with a second FCSEMS. Overall, the strictures resolved in 30/33 (90.9%) patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Intraductal placement of a short FCSEMS is suitable for the treatment of segmental extrahepatic BBS. This new removable design offered prolonged stenting and drainage for BBS for up to one year with minimal complications.",2014,Journal of digestive diseases
Real-time Emulation of Vehicular Non-stationary Channels,"This article describes the use of a channel emulator to assess the performance of modems installed in vehicles, responsible for exchanging safety and traffic efficiency information, using the amendment to Wi-Fi, 802.11p. It is therefore essential to thoroughly model the non-stationary channel, characterized by dynamic environments, high node velocities and multipath. The channel is described by a tappeddelay line model, in which the taps are determined by an optimization algorithm, based on Lasso, on real-life measurements in Lund, Sweden. The algorithm minimizes the mean square error between the approximated channel description and the original measurements, limiting the number of taps in use. The emulator is part of a project developed in the Telecommunications Institute of the Technical University of Vienna. Its further development enables the emulation of several consecutive scenarios and the configuration of the delay parameters for each magnitude and phase. The performance of the channel emulator is evaluated through PER, for several scenarios and attenuations, showing that stationary channel models do not emulate vehicular scenarios realistically and, for the non-stationary model, exchanged information is almost completely lost except when the vehicles are in close proximity.",2018,
Forecasting Volatility Using Double Shrinkage Methods*,"In this paper, we propose and evaluate a shrinkage based methodology that is designed to improve the accuracy of volatility forecasts. Our approach is based on a two-step procedure for extracting latent common volatility factors from a large dimensional and high-frequency dataset. In the first step, we apply either least absolute shrinkage operator (LASSO) or the elastic net (EN) shrinkage on estimated integrated volatilities, in order to select a subset of assets that are informative about the target asset. In the second step, we utilize (sparse) principal component analysis on the selected assets, in order to estimate latent return factors, which are in turn used to construct latent volatility factors. Our two-step method is found to yield more accurate volatility predictions than a variety of alternative models based on approaches such as direct application of (S)PCA and direct application of LASSO or EN shrinkage, when comparing out-of-sample R2s and mean absolute forecasting errors, and when implementing predictive accuracy tests. Additionally model confidence sets are found to contain models solely based on our two-step approach. These forecasting gains are found to be robust to the use of original or log-scale realized volatility models, different data sampling frequencies, and different forecasting sub-periods.",2019,
Survival Prognostic Factors of Male Breast Cancer in Southern Iran: a LASSO-Cox Regression Approach.,"We used to LASSO-Cox method for determining prognostic factors of male breast cancer survival and showed the superiority of this method compared to Cox proportional hazard model in low sample size setting. In order to identify and estimate exactly the relative hazard of the most important factors effective for the survival duration of male breast cancer, the LASSO-Cox method has been used. Our data includes the information of male breast cancer patients in Fars province, south of Iran, from 1989 to 2008. Cox proportional hazard and LASSO-Cox models were fitted for 20 classified variables. To reduce the impact of missing data, the multiple imputation method was used 20 times through the Markov chain Mont Carlo method and the results were combined with Rubin's rules. In 50 patients, the age at diagnosis was 59.6 (SD=12.8) years with a minimum of 34 and maximum of 84 years and the mean of survival time was 62 months. Three, 5 and 10 year survival were 92%, 77% and 26%, respectively. Using the LASSO-Cox method led to eliminating 8 low effect variables and also decreased the standard error by 2.5 to 7 times. The relative efficiency of LASSO-Cox method compared with the Cox proportional hazard method was calculated as 22.39. The19 years follow of male breast cancer patients show that the age, having a history of alcohol use, nipple discharge, laterality, histological grade and duration of symptoms were the most important variables that have played an effective role in the patient's survival. In such situations, estimating the coefficients by LASSO-Cox method will be more efficient than the Cox's proportional hazard method.",2015,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP

"A Comparative Investigation of the Combined Effects of Pre-Processing, Wavelength Selection, and Regression Methods on Near-Infrared Calibration Model Performance","Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is being widely used in various fields ranging from pharmaceutics to the food industry for analyzing chemical and physical properties of the substances concerned. Its advantages over other analytical techniques include available physical interpretation of spectral data, nondestructive nature and high speed of measurements, and little or no need for sample preparation. The successful application of NIR spectroscopy relies on three main aspects: pre-processing of spectral data to eliminate nonlinear variations due to temperature, light scattering effects and many others, selection of those wavelengths that contribute useful information, and identification of suitable calibration models using linear/nonlinear regression . Several methods have been developed for each of these three aspects and many comparative studies of different methods exist for an individual aspect or some combinations. However, there is still a lack of comparative studies for the interactions among these three aspects, which can shed light on what role each aspect plays in the calibration and how to combine various methods of each aspect together to obtain the best calibration model. This paper aims to provide such a comparative study based on four benchmark data sets using three typical pre-processing methods, namely, orthogonal signal correction (OSC), extended multiplicative signal correction (EMSC) and optical path-length estimation and correction (OPLEC); two existing wavelength selection methods, namely, stepwise forward selection (SFS) and genetic algorithm optimization combined with partial least squares regression for spectral data (GAPLSSP); four popular regression methods, namely, partial least squares (PLS), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The comparative study indicates that, in general, pre-processing of spectral data can play a significant role in the calibration while wavelength selection plays a marginal role and the combination of certain pre-processing, wavelength selection, and nonlinear regression methods can achieve superior performance over traditional linear regression-based calibration.",2017,Applied Spectroscopy

A globally convergent algorithm for lasso-penalized mixture of linear regression models,"Variable selection is an old and pervasive problem in regression analysis. One solution is to impose a lasso penalty to shrink parameter estimates toward zero and perform continuous model selection. The lasso-penalized mixture of linear regressions model (L-MLR) is a class of regularization methods for the model selection problem in the fixed number of variables setting. A new algorithm is proposed for the maximum penalized-likelihood estimation of the L-MLR model. This algorithm is constructed via the minorizationâ€“maximization algorithm paradigm. Such a construction allows for coordinate-wise updates of the parameter components, and produces globally convergent sequences of estimates that generate monotonic sequences of penalized log-likelihood values. These three features are missing in the previously presented approximate expectationâ€“maximization algorithms. The previous difficulty in producing a globally convergent algorithm for the maximum penalized-likelihood estimation of the L-MLR model is due to the intractability of finding exact updates for the mixture model mixing proportions in the maximization-step. This issue is resolved by showing that it can be converted into a simple numerical root finding problem that is proven to have a unique solution. The method is tested in simulation and with an application to Major League Baseball salary data from the 1990s and the present day, where the concept of whether player salaries are associated with batting performance is investigated.",2018,Comput.

Uncovering reservoirs of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: children contaminating households or households contaminating children?,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) emerged in the late 1980s and is a leading cause of skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) in the United States.1 Unlike hospitalassociated MRSA strains, community-associated MRSA strains, commonly designated USA300 by use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, initially were found in children without health care exposure. These strains of community-associated MRSA now cause infections in community and hospital settings.2 Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the number of cases of invasive community-associated MRSA infection increased among children between 2005 and 2010.3 Noninvasive MRSA infections far outnumber invasive MRSA infections among children and can lead to a significant economic burden. Many children and families are plagued with recurrent SSTIs. Practitioners have become facile at draining and managing MRSA abscesses, but challenges and uncertainties remain surrounding how to prevent recurrent SSTIs.4 Because most children with recurrent SSTIs are colonized with MRSA, decolonization is commonly prescribed.5 Decolonization involves treating patients with topical antibiotics (intranasal mupirocin calcium) and topical antiseptics (eg, chlorhexidine gluconate washes or bleach baths). Programs can include treating the affected individual or treating entire households.6 Different decolonization regimens have varying efficacy at eradicating MRSA from the body.7 Recurrent infections, however, are common in up to 50% of children despite decolonization protocols.6 Recently, investigators tried periodic treatments with weekly bleach baths, but infections still recurred frequently.8 A number of possibilities may explain why decolonization strategies fail to prevent recurrent infections. First, a child may harbor a mupirocin-resistant strain that will not respond to therapy. Second, tolerability and compliance with intranasal antibiotic administration for children may be limited. Third, other members of a childâ€™s household or the childâ€™s day care, school, or sports team may be colonized with MRSA and, therefore, may reexpose the child shortly after treatment. Finally, many studies have suggested that children become reexposed to the same virulent MRSA strain from inanimate environmental surfaces or objects, including gym towels, razors, and stuffed animals.9 In this issue of the journal, Fritz and colleagues10 present results from a well-designed cohort study that adds to the literature describing households as reservoirs of MRSA for children with recurrent SSTIs.9,11 They enrolled children with community-associated MRSA SSTIs and searched for household reservoirs of S aureus and MRSA. In 50 households, swab samples were obtained from 21 high-touch surfaces, and the bacterial isolates were tested for relatedness to strains cultured from participants, household contacts, and even pets. Methicillin-resistant S aureus was recovered from at least 1 surface in 50% of households. It was most frequently recovered from the participantâ€™s bed sheets and pillowcase, television remote control, and bathroom hand towel. The bacteria were also recovered from 12% of dogs. In 40% of households, a strain was found on a surface that matched the isolates obtained from the participant. Of the 50 households, only 1 dog had an MRSA strain related to a childâ€™s strain, implying that dogs might be a less likely reservoir than inanimate surfaces. This study10 is provocative and raises many questions, the most important of which are as follows: How does environmental contamination contribute to the epidemic of recurrent SSTIs? Is the environment the source of exposure or reexposure that increases a childâ€™s risk of infection, or is the environment contaminated by the infected or colonized child? Would household cleaning enhance the effectiveness of decolonization therapy? Have decolonization strategies been limited because people are not thorough enough (eg, they do not clean their television remote controls)? This study10 demonstrates that the household is a reservoir of MRSA, but it does not establish a causal relationship between a contaminated environment and recurrent SSTIs. The role of the environment in human disease has been studied for decades, mostly in relation to noninfectious diseases such as asthma. Now, environmental reservoirs of bacteria are being recognized as important contributors to bacterial spread in hospitals.12 In fact, patients admitted to hospital rooms where the prior occupant had MRSA are more likely to acquire MRSA than are patients admitted to hospital rooms where the prior occupant did not have MRSA.13 As a result, hospitals are focusing on environmental decontamination to prevent MRSA. These measures include standard cleaning but also incorporate novel cleaning technologies, such as UV light, hydrogen peroxide gas, and copper surfaces. Novel technologies have been incorporated because routine cleaning often proves to be inadequate. Fritz and colleagues10 attempted to correlate household cleaning with environmental contamination. They identified a lot of variation in the frequency of cleaning common household surfaces, and most people reported that they did not routinely clean some commonly touched surfaces (telephone, television remote control, and bathroom doorknobs). Overall, no association was found between the frequency of cleaning seRelated article page 1030 Opinion Editorial",2014,JAMA pediatrics

CYCLONEâ€”A Utility for De Novo Sequencing of Microbial Cyclic Peptides,"AbstractWe have developed a de novo sequencing software tool (CYCLONE) and applied it for determination of cyclic peptides. The program uses a non-redundant database of 312 nonribosomal building blocks identified to date in bacteria and fungi (more than 230 additional residues in the database list were isobaric). The software was used to fully characterize the tandem mass spectrum of several cyclic peptides and provide sequence tags. The general strategy of the script was based on fragment ion pre-characterization to accomplish unambiguous b-ion series assignments. Showcase examples were a cyclic tetradepsipeptide beauverolide, a cyclic hexadepsipeptide roseotoxin A, a lasso-like hexapeptide pseudacyclin A, and a cyclic undecapeptide cyclosporin A. The extent of ion scrambling in smaller peptides was as low as 5Â % of total ion current; this demonstrated the feasibility of CYCLONE de novo sequencing. The robustness of the script was also tested against database sets of various sizes and isotope-containing data. It can be downloaded from the http://ms.biomed.cas.cz/MSTools/ website.

MiRFFS: a functional group-based feature selection method for the identification of microRNA biomarkers,"The identification of microRNA biomarkers has been a central task in disease diagnosis, prognosis assessment and drug design. Both statistical methods and machine learning approaches have been applied to the identification of biomarkers. Especially, feature selection and regularisation techniques are efficient for filtering informative attributes from a high-dimensional space. In order to enhance their performance, the intrinsic data structure is usually exploited. In this study, we utilise the GO-based semantic similarity to infer miRNA functional groups, and propose a new feature selection method, called MiRFFS (MiRNA Functional group-based Feature Selection). We also incorporate the functional group information to the sparse group Lasso (SGL), and compare MiRFFS with SGL as well as the state-of-the-art feature selection methods. Experimental results on five miRNA microarray profiles of breast cancer show that MiRFFS can achieve a compact feature subset with substantial improvement on the accuracy compared with other feature selection and lasso methods.",2017,IJDMB
Relative fitness components measured with competitive PCR.,"In mating systems with sperm competition, paternity is frequently established with modern DNA techniques. These methods are often expensive and cumbersome, and can be especially difficult for highly fecund species. An additional objective of many paternity studies is to discover the relationship between sperm number and paternity. We present here a competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol, coupled with the use of an automated sequencer, that has two functions: (i) to measure directly relative sperm output of males in sperm competition; and (ii) to estimate paternity distributions of large numbers of offspring simultaneously. Our technique was calibrated using a microsatellite locus of the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, with the result that product ratio after competitive PCR accurately reflected the initial template proportions of known mixtures of DNA. When we applied our technique to multiple larvae of separate mating events we found that paternity distributions estimated with the competitive PCR technique closely matched the estimates derived from the traditional method of pooling paternity data from individual larvae. Finally, we compared paternity of these spawns with relative sperm contribution estimates. This comparison suggests that ejaculate size alone does not predict a male's proportion of paternity within the group.",2000,Molecular ecology
Insights into the biosynthesis and stability of the lasso peptide capistruin.,"Capistruin is a 19-residue ribosomally synthesized lasso peptide encoded by the capABCD gene cluster in Burkholderia thailandensis. It is composed of an N-terminal 9-residue macrolactam ring, through which the 10-residue C-terminal tail is threaded. Using a heterologous capistruin production system in Escherichia coli, we have generated 48 mutants of the precursor protein CapA to gain insights into capistruin biosynthesis. Only 4 residues (Gly1, Arg11, Val12, and Ile13) of the lasso sequence were found to be critical for maturation. Tandem mass spectrometric fragmentation studies of capistruin F16A/F18A proved Arg15 to be responsible for the trapping of the C-terminal tail. Substituting Arg15 and Phe16 by alanine revealed a temperature-sensitive capistruin derivative, which unfolds into a branched cyclic peptide upon heating. In conclusion, our global mutagenic approach revealed a low overall specificity of the biosynthetic machinery and important structure-stability correlations.",2009,Chemistry & biology
Tumor Gene Characteristics Selection Method Based on Multi-Agent,"For the tumor gene expression profile data that aiming to high-dimension small samples, how to select the clas- sification feature of samples among thousands genes effectively is the difficult problems for analysis on tumor gene ex- pression profile. First to partition the data set into K average divisions, to use Lasso method performing feature selection on each respectively, and then merge each selected division of subset together to perform feather selection again, and get the final feature gene. This experiment adopts the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier, to take the classification performance of feature gene set by Leave One Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) method as evaluation standard, improve classification accuracy and with algorithm in good stability. Because of lowered dimensions in each time of calculation, it solves the problem of overhead computational-expensive, and also solves the problem of ""over-fitting"" in a certain grade. Thus it gets conclusion that the K-partitioning Lasso method shall be an effective method for tumor feature gene selection.",2015,The Open Cybernetics & Systemics Journal
Recreational Potential of Kazakhstan and Prospects of Medical Health Tourism in This Country.,"The present article analyzes the comparative characteristics of the recreational potential of hydro areas of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 20 hydro areas were marked out for comparative assessment of their attractiveness and recreational possibilities of the development of medical health tourism on the basis of balneological resources. The aim of the study is to identify the areas with the high natural recreational potential, but with a low level of exploration, thus identifying the most promising areas for the development of medical health tourism. The article gives comparative characteristics of areas with healthimproving resources and the level of their development to achieve this goal. The outline maps of natural and socio-economic and recreational resources of Kazakhstan and zoning were made for the purpose of comparison of the recreational potential areas on the basis on the performed analyses. As a result, the hydro mineral regions of Kazakhstan were classified into 4 groups with very high, high, medium and low-recreational potential. The presented results of the study will help to formulate proposals for the development of specific areas with a high medical-health potential.

YESSENGABYLOVA ET AL. 2010). Also, medical health tourism is defined as active associated with the movement of the individual beyond the permanent place of residence and having an impact on the strengthening of his health and physical development (Vetitnev, 2011). According to the definition of the famous German scientist W. Nahrstedt (2004), medical health tourism includes a visit of local and foreign tourists to the balneological resorts and others by changing their permanent residence and provides them with health programs under their personal responsibility and as a rule by paying privately. Dr. Aris Ikkos (2002) believes that medical health tourism is associated mainly with thermal tourism and visits to the mineral springs for medicinal purposes. This kind of tourism is characterized by the strong natural-resource orientability. The natural resources of medical health tourism include mineral water, therapeutic mud, climatic resources, etc. On the basis of these resources, the most popular spa resorts work in the world. France offers thermal and seaside resorts; water and mud, thalassotherapy, and even wine therapy is used there. The thalassotherapy center Thermes Marins Biarritz that offers a lot of wellness and therapeutic programs is considered to be the resort number one in France and Europe. Experts all over the world appreciate the healing properties of the famous mineral water resort of Vichy. Mineral waters and thermal springs in Switzerland are deservedly popular. Thus, the healing waters of Leukerbad resort brought this health resort more fame than the ski slopes. There are 50 climatic health resorts in Germany. The resort of Baden-Baden is in the biggest demand. The European most modern thermal center Caracalla-thermae and the hottest source Helkvelle (""Infernal source"") with a water temperature up to 69Â°C are situated there. Friedrichsbad thermae are known thanks to original treatment combining thalassotherapy with thermal baths. A strong demand has formed for ""therapeutic"" Austria recently. In many respects it is caused by the fact that there are a lot of thermal springs in the country. Speleotherapy is conducted on the Gastein resorts, resort Baden near Vienna is famous for its urban thermae, Bad Ischl uses the beneficial properties of salt solutions. Thermal waters are one of the numerous national treasures of Italy. The most well-known Italian resort of world importance is situated on the island of Ischia. People do not drink mineral water in the resorts, but use, as well as mud, for special baths. There are a lot of world-known resorts in Czech Republic. Healing traditions of Carlsbad source-geyser go off in 600-year history. Its hyperthermal water is highly effective in the treatment of various diseases. 40 mineral springs of Marienbad have been called as water that ""returns health"" since 1528. In the open reserves of thermal waters Hungary takes the second place in the world. Mineral springs are situated in all regions of the country; they are year-round and have unique healing properties. By uniqueness and abundance of thalassotherapeutic and other health resources, Bulgaria takes one of the leading places in Europe. There are a lot of other spas that use mineral springs, mud and other natural resources for spa treatment in the world. 623 underground water deposits were studied on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan, their total stock amounts to 43,383,500 m3 per day. From that part, mineral water reserves are used for balneological purposes of 29800 m3 per day, they make up 0.5% of all groundwater. Nowadays in Kazakhstan there are 89 known sources with mineralized water treatment and drinking, balneological and dining purpose, and 47 deposits of therapeutic muds. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL & SCIENCE EDUCATION 8449 There are 120 sanatoriums on the basis of these mineral resources in the country. Most of them are balneological ones, although generally there are mixed types of resorts: mud-bath, balneoclimateric etc. (Veselov, 1999). In Kazakhstan, ground mineral water is widespread for balneological different indicators of mineralization and chemical composition, temperature, hydrogen ion concentration, as well as various gases, organic and microelement composition. At beginning of 1970, the Kazakh scientist Zh. Sydykov (1972) marked out 6 balneological groups of underground mineral waters on the territory of Kazakhstan and gave a description of each group. Most balneological groups of mineral waters are found in different areas of Kazakhstan in different volumes. The country has used mineral waters for healing and relaxation for a long time. Thermal ground water began to be used only recently, despite the fact that it is widespread throughout Kazakhstan. Thermal waters can be regarded as worth developing because of their human health implications and, if thermal tourism is promoted, their importance to the local economy (Gonzalez-Barreiro et al., 2009). Hydrotherapy use of plain water for therapy, through the external application of water and health benefiting from water physical properties such as temperature, hydrostatic pressure, viscosity and electric conductivity; bathing, showers, water jets, underwater exercises, and body wraps are some methods of water application. Hydrotherapy has wide acceptance in the rehabilitation program in recent decades. By this method taking advantage two of the most basic properties of the water, the thermal and the mechanical stimuli (Terzis et al., 2014). Hydrotherapy is commonly used along with pelotherapy. Pelotherapy or peloid therapy is the external application of all or part of peloids, it being a therapeutic modality that, despite having defined mechanisms of action, route and site of different application, is still under the umbrella of balneotherapy, hydrotherapy and spa treatment (Bender et al., 2005). Peloid is amaturated mud or muddy suspension/dispersion with healing and/or cosmetic properties, composed of a complex mixture of finegrained materials of geologic and/or biologic origins, mineral water or sea water, and commonly organic compounds from a biological metabolic activity. When the maturation takes place in the natural environment it is called natural peloid and can be considered a healing mud, and in other cases it is named peloid (Gomes et al., 2013). Peloids are peat, sapropelic, silt, sulfite, freshwater clayey silts, and knoll hydrothermal silts composed of the mineral and organic matters, which underwent complicated transformations as a result of physicochemical, chemical, biochemical processes and represent homogeneous fine-particle plastic mass, which is used in a heated state to perform mud cure (Nekipelova, Vlasov & Luneva, 2013). Peloids are divided into several types according to the natural structure. There are types of peloids according to the international classification: 1. Inorganic mud. Their organic substances consist of very small substances mixed with water. 2. The organic sapropel mud and gyttja, they are mainly composed of organic matter, formed from the remains of plants and insects from the soil and sand, as well as other substances. 8450 A. YESSENGABYLOVA ET AL. 3. Peat mud is generated mainly from plant residues and organic matter that was converted into humus, and as part of inorganic substances are found mixed in varying amounts. 4. Mixed types of peloids. 5. The substances made under the influence of from wind exposure â€“ kaolin, soil. 6. Synthetic peloids (paraffin). Kazakhstan has an inexhaustible supply of mineral mud with healing properties. According to the above classification, Kazakhstan muds are divided into the following types: 1. Inorganic mud (mud of salt lakes, springs). 2. The organic mud is very rare in Kazakhstan (Ortaderesen deposit in the north of Lake Balkhash). Most of the existing stocks of medical resources are not currently used; the proportion of operating medical resources is a smaller part of the balneological potential. Tourism requires and uses a geographical space. This space has a physical substrate, the natural environment, consisting of physical and biological elements (its climate, geology, topography, flora and fauna, etc.) and also has elements created by human activities. This geographical space (and its constituent elements, including climate) can act simultaneously as a factor influencing the location of tourism, a",2016,International journal of environmental and science education
Delayed polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration is an important component of Thalassophryne maculosa venom pathogenesis.,"Thalassophryne maculosa fish envenomation is characterized by severe pain, dizziness, fever, edema and necrosis. Here, the dynamic of cellular influx, activation status of phagocytic cells, and inflammatory modulator production in the acute inflammatory response to T. maculosa venom was studied using an experimental model. Leukocyte counting was performed (2 h to 21 days) after venom injection in BALB/c mice footpads. Our results showed an uncommon leukocyte migration kinetic after venom injection, with early mononuclear cell recruitment followed by elevated and delayed neutrophil influx. The pattern of chemokine expression is consistent with the delay in neutrophil recruitment to the footpad: T. maculosa venom stimulated an early production of IL-1beta, IL-6, and MCP-1, but was unable to induce an effective early TNF-alpha and KC release. Complementary to these observations, we detected a marked increase in soluble KC and TNF-alpha in footpad at 7 days post-venom injection when a prominent influx of neutrophils was also detected. In addition, we demonstrated that bone marrow-derived macrophages and dendritic cells were strongly stimulated by the venom, showing up-regulated ability to capture FITC-dextran. Thus, the reduced levels of KC and TNF-alpha in footpad of mice concomitant with a defective accumulation of neutrophils at earlier times provide an important clue to uncovering the mechanism by which T. maculosa venom regulates neutrophil movement.",2008,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology
Orthogonal ML for Demand Estimation: High Dimensional Causal Inference in Dynamic Panelsâˆ—,"There has been growing interest in how economists can import machine learning tools designed for prediction to accelerate and automate the model selection process, while still retaining desirable inference properties for causal parameters. Focusing on partially linear models, we extend the Double ML framework to allow for (1) a number of treatments that may grow with the sample size and (2) the analysis of panel data under sequentially exogenous errors. Our low-dimensional treatment (LD) regime directly extends the work in [Chernozhukov et al., 2016], by showing that the coefficients from a second stage, ordinary least squares estimator attain root-n convergence and desired coverage even if the dimensionality of treatment is allowed to grow. In a high-dimensional sparse (HDS) regime, we show that second stage LASSO and debiased LASSO have asymptotic properties equivalent to oracle estimators with no upstream error. We argue that these advances make Double ML methods a desirable alternative for practitioners estimating short-term demand elasticities in non-contractual settings. âˆ—We would like to thank Vasilis Syrgkanis, Whitney Newey, Anna Mikusheva, Brian Quistorff and participants of MIT Econometrics Lunch for valuable comments. ar X iv :1 71 2. 09 98 8v 2 [ st at .M L ] 1 0 Ja n 20 18",2018,
Genotype by environment interaction for seeds yield in pea (Pisum sativum L.) using additive main effects and multiplicative interaction model,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the genotype by environment interaction using the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction model for seeds yield of pea cultivars grown in Poland. Twelve pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivars: Bohun, Boruta, Cysterski, Ezop, Kavalir, Lasso, Medal, Santana, Tarchalska, Terno, Wenus and Zekon were evaluated in 20 environments (ten locations in 2 years). The experiment was laid out as randomized complete block design with three replicates. Seeds yield ranged from 26.10 dt haâˆ’1 (for Wenus in Radostowo 2011) to 79.73 dt haâˆ’1 (for Lasso in SÅ‚upia 2010), with an average of 50.70 dt haâˆ’1. AMMI analyses revealed significant genotype and environmental effects as well as genotype-by-environment interaction with respect to seeds yield. In the analysis of variance, 89.19% of the total seeds yield variation was explained by environment, 1.65% by differences between genotypes, and 8.33% by GE interaction. The cultivar Terno is the highest stability. The cultivar Tarchalska is recommended for further inclusion in the breeding program because its stability and the highest averages of seeds yield.",2019,Euphytica
Reconstructing DNA copy number by joint segmentation of multiple sequences,"BackgroundVariations in DNA copy number carry information on the modalities of genome evolution and mis-regulation of DNA replication in cancer cells. Their study can help localize tumor suppressor genes, distinguish different populations of cancerous cells, and identify genomic variations responsible for disease phenotypes. A number of different high throughput technologies can be used to identify copy number variable sites, and the literature documents multiple effective algorithms. We focus here on the specific problem of detecting regions where variation in copy number is relatively common in the sample at hand. This problem encompasses the cases of copy number polymorphisms, related samples, technical replicates, and cancerous sub-populations from the same individual.ResultsWe present a segmentation method named generalized fused lasso (GFL) to reconstruct copy number variant regions. GFL is based on penalized estimation and is capable of processing multiple signals jointly. Our approach is computationally very attractive and leads to sensitivity and specificity levels comparable to those of state-of-the-art specialized methodologies. We illustrate its applicability with simulated and real data sets.ConclusionsThe flexibility of our framework makes it applicable to data obtained with a wide range of technology. Its versatility and speed make GFL particularly useful in the initial screening stages of large data sets.",2012,BMC Bioinformatics
