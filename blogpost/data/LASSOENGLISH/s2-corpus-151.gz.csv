Isolation and characterization of marine bacteria capable of utilizing phthalate,"Eleven phthalate-degrading bacterial strains were isolated from seawater collected off the coast of Japan. The isolates were found to be most closely related to the marine bacterial genera Alteromonas, Citreicella, Marinomonas, Marinovum, Pelagibaca, Rhodovulum, Sulfitobacter, Thalassobius, Thalassococcus, Thalassospira, and Tropicibacter. For the first time, members of these genera were shown to be capable of growth on phthalate. The plate assay for visual detection of phthalate dioxygenase activity and PCR detection of a possible gene encoding 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylase indicated that phthalate is degraded via 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate to protocatechuate in all the isolates.",2012,World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology
Real-time road traffic forecasting using regime-switching space-time models and adaptive LASSO,"Smart transportation technologies require real-time traffic prediction to be both fast and scalable to full urban networks. We discuss a method that is able to meet this challenge while accounting for nonlinear traffic dynamics and space-time dependencies of traffic variables. Nonlinearity is taken into account by a union of non-overlapping linear regimes characterized by a sequence of temporal thresholds. In each regime, for each measurement location, a penalized estimation scheme, namely the adaptive absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), is implemented to perform model selection and coefficient estimation simultaneously. Both the robust to outliers least absolute deviation estimates and conventional LASSO estimates are considered. The methodology is illustrated on 5-minute average speed data from three highway networks. Copyright Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2012,Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry
"Alkalimicrobium pacificum gen. nov., sp. nov., a marine bacterium in the family Rhodobacteraceae.","A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain F15T, was isolated from a deep-sea sediment of the western Pacific Ocean. The temperature, pH and NaCl ranges for growth were 4-50â€‰Â°C, pHâ€‰6-11 and 0-10â€‰% (w/v), respectively. Strain F15T showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Sagittula stellata E-37T (96.4%), followed by Ponticoccus litoralis CL-GR66T (96.4%), Antarctobacter heliothermus EL-219T (96.3%) and Thalassococcus lentus YCS-24T (96.0%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data showed that strain F15T formed a lineage within the family Rhodobacteraceae of the class Alphaproteobacteria. The polar lipid profile of strain F15T comprised significant amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, one unidentified glycolipid and one unidentified phospholipid. The predominant cellular fatty acids were summed feature 8 (C18â€‰:â€‰1Ï‰7c and/or C18â€‰:â€‰1Ï‰6c, 40.2%), anteiso-C15â€‰:â€‰0 (30.4%) and anteiso-C17â€‰:â€‰0 (9.7%). The genomic DNA G+C content of strain F15T was 60.2â€Šmol% and the major respiratory quinone was Q-10. On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic data, strain F15T is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus within the family Rhodobacteraceae, for which the name Alkalimicrobium pacificum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

Predicting product return volume using machine learning methods,"Abstract In 2015, U.S. consumers returned goods worth $261 billion and the return rates for online sales sometimes exceeded 30%. Manufacturers and retailers have an interest in predicting return volume to address operational challenges in managing product returns. In this paper, we develop and test data-driven models for predicting return volume at the retailer, product type and period levels using a rich data set comprised of detailed operations on each product, and retailer information. The goal is to achieve a good prediction accuracy out of sample. We consider main effects and detailed interaction effects models using various machine learning methods. We find that Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) yields a predictive model achieving the best prediction accuracy for future return volume due to its ability to select informative interaction terms out of more than one thousand possible combinations. The LASSO model also turns in consistent performance based on several robustness tests and is easy to implement in practice. Our work provides a general predictive model framework for manufacturers to track product returns.",2020,Eur. J. Oper. Res.
Sparse Regression by Projection and Sparse Discriminant Analysis.,"Recent years have seen active developments of various penalized regression methods, such as LASSO and elastic net, to analyze high dimensional data. In these approaches, the direction and length of the regression coefficients are determined simultaneously. Due to the introduction of penalties, the length of the estimates can be far from being optimal for accurate predictions. We introduce a new framework, regression by projection, and its sparse version to analyze high dimensional data. The unique nature of this framework is that the directions of the regression coefficients are inferred first, and the lengths and the tuning parameters are determined by a cross validation procedure to achieve the largest prediction accuracy. We provide a theoretical result for simultaneous model selection consistency and parameter estimation consistency of our method in high dimension. This new framework is then generalized such that it can be applied to principal components analysis, partial least squares and canonical correlation analysis. We also adapt this framework for discriminant analysis. Compared to the existing methods, where there is relatively little control of the dependency among the sparse components, our method can control the relationships among the components. We present efficient algorithms and related theory for solving the sparse regression by projection problem. Based on extensive simulations and real data analysis, we demonstrate that our method achieves good predictive performance and variable selection in the regression setting, and the ability to control relationships between the sparse components leads to more accurate classification. In supplemental materials available online, the details of the algorithms and theoretical proofs, and R codes for all simulation studies are provided.",2015,"Journal of computational and graphical statistics : a joint publication of American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Interface Foundation of North America"
Developing Nonresponse Weighting Adjustments for Population-Based HIV Impact Assessments Surveys in Three African Countries,"In collaboration with national Ministries of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other partners, ICAP at Columbia University is conducting Populationbased HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) surveys in 12 sub-Saharan African countries. We use data from the first three PHIA surveysâ€•in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabweâ€•to study the effect of survey nonresponse weighting adjustments on HIV prevalence estimates. In developing the nonresponse adjustments, decisions made about the variables to use in the adjustments, and about the formation of nonresponse cells, may affect survey estimates and their standard errors. The nonresponse adjustments in PHIA surveys are made in three stages, first to adjust for nonresponse to the household interview, then for person interview nonresponse in responding households, and finally for failure to obtain analyzable blood samples among persons responding to the interview. A sizable number of variables is available for use in making the nonresponse adjustments for the personal interview and blood sample nonresponse. This paper describes the use of the LASSO regression and CHAID for variable selection in making these nonresponse adjustments. It then examines how the use of different sets of variables employed in the nonresponse adjustments affects the surveysâ€™ HIV prevalence estimates.",2017,
Abstract 4791: Prognostic model of lower grade gliomas,"Background Lower grade gliomas (LGGs WHO grade II/III glioma) account for one third of all gliomas. Most LGGs generally show a slow progression, but some show a more aggressive clinical course, where several clinical/genetic factors, such as tumor size, presence of neurologic deficit before surgery and 1p19q LOH, have been reported to correlate patientsâ€™ survival. However, no large-scale studies prevent establishment of a reliable prognostication system. Methods Status of somatic mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) were investigated for 335 Japanese patients with LGG using whole exome/targeted sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism-array karyotyping, respectively. Corresponding data were also publically available for 425 patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (URL: http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). Correlation of genetic lesions and other parameters with overall survival (OS) was analyzed for combined 538 patients, which were divided into two sets, 269 training and 269 validation sets. First, the 269 patients of the training set were classified into 3 types according to the characteristic mutations and CNVs: Type 1 (mutated IDH with 1p/19q LOH), Type 2 (mutated IDH without 1p19q LOH), Type 3 (IDH wild type) patients. Using the LASSO Cox regression model, we built a classifier based on gene mutations, CNVs (over 5% of cases), sex, age, pathology, WHO grade and operation type (gross total resection or not). We validated the accuracy of this classifier in terms of prediction of OS in the independent group of 269 patients. Results Using the LASSO model, the patients in Type 1 and 3 were grouped into low- and high-risk groups, whereas Type 2 was not because no significant risk factors were extracted for Type 2 patients. Combining high-risk Type 1 and Type 2, between which OS was not significantly different, the entire training set was divided into 4 groups showing significantly different OS, low- and intermediate-risk groups and high- and very high-risk groups, respectively. In the training set, 5-year OS for low-, intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk groups was 100%, 82%, 49%, and 0%, which were 94%, 70%, 43%, and 14%, in the validation set, respectively. The performance of the new model was evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, which showed significantly higher accuracy compared to other models based solely on clinical/histological parameters, including pathology, WHO grade and Karnofsky performance status (KPS). Conclusion We established a new classifier based both on genetic and clinical parameters, which provides a reliable tool for predicting OS in LGGs patients and should be useful to guide therapy.

Model Related Instabilities in High Dimensional Linear Models,"The use of high dimensional linear models is common in large database settings. The linearity of such models is often assumed. In sparse settings with the number of subjects (n) less than the number of variables (p) standard algorithms include the lars-LASSO approach which often provides stable convergence. In some cases the underlying data may be more appropriately modeled with a nonlinear model. The use of a linear model in such cases creates model mis-specification and instability for lars-LASSO based approaches. This is studied by using simulations with various relative sample sizes, correlation structures and error distributions.",2016,Journal of biometrics & biostatistics
"Education, Certification, and the Earnings of Industrial Accountants","Utilizing a model of the relationship between skill accumulation and earnings known as human capital theory, we analyzed the incremental earnings associated with various educational and professional credential for a sample of members oftheNationalAssociation of Accountants (NM). Data were collected by means of a questionnaire survey ofNM members and were analyzed utilizing a multiple regression technique. Earnings is regressed on various education and certification variables. Employment characteristics and personal characteristics of the respondents are included as control variables. Our analysis documents positive earnings increments for the bachelors and MBA degrees and the CPA certificate. For the MBA and CPA, these returns are concentrated in the middle and later stages of accountants' careers. Also, we examine the variation in these returns across different subgroups of our sample. Individuals in finance positions have more responsibility and are more upwardly mobile than those in traditional accounting jobs. Prior experience in public accounting is found to be a partial substitute for the above credentials. Finally, the credentials generated more consistent returns in smaller firms. Observations have been made in the accounting literature about the relative 1dvantages to accountants of acquiring various educational degrees and/or profes;ional certifications. Some of these observations are based on analyses of the 'Department of Accounting and Department of Economics respectively, The University or [)avton. 300 Colle!!e Park, Dayton Ohio 45469-2250. difference in average earnings between those who have a given level of education or a given certificate versus those who do not. Such analyses involve a simple comparison of mean earnings disaggregated by one or two variables such as age, race, or sex (for example, see Serocke [1985] and Arbital [1986]). These analyzes do not take into account other variables that may explain the earnings differentials. For example, an earnings differential between accountants with a specific educational degree versus those lacking that degree may be due to a difference in the average years of work experience between the two groups rather than the degree itself. The relationships between educational credentials, professional certifications, and earnings in the accounting profession are of importance to undergraduate accounting students. After earning baccalaureate degrees, students must decide whether to prepare for professional exams and/or to enter graduate school. Examination of the inter-relationships between degree,certifications, and earnings can assist students in making these decisions in an informed and rational manner.",1990,
In silico markers: an evolutionary and statistical approach to select informative genes of human breast cancer subtypes,"BackgroundRecent advancement in bioinformatics offers the ability to identify informative genes from high dimensional gene expression data. Selection of informative genes from these large datasets has emerged as an issue of major concern among researchers.ObjectiveGene functionality and regulatory mechanisms can be understood through the analysis of these gene expression data. Here, we present a computational method to identify informative genes for breast cancer subtypes such as Basal, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2), luminal A (LumA), and luminal B (LumB).MethodsThe proposed In Silico Markers method is a wrapper feature selection method based on Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. Moreover, the composite measure consisting of relevance, redundancy, and rank score of frequently appeared genes are used to select informative genes.ResultsThe informative genes are validated by statistical and biologically relevant criteria. For a comparative evaluation of the proposed approach, biological similarity score designed on semantic similarity measure of GO terms are investigated. Further, the proposed technique is evaluated with 7 existing gene selection techniques using two-class annotated breast cancer subtype datasets.ConclusionThe utilization of this method can bring about the discovery of informative genes. Furthermore, under multiple criteria decision-making set-up, informative genes selected by the In Silico Markers are found to be admirable than the compared methods selected genes.",2019,Genes & Genomics
"Prognostic Impact of Genetic Subgroups and Development of Gene Classifiers for Response, PFS and OS In Multiple Myeloma Patients Treated with Bortezomib or Conventional Agents In HOVON65/GMMG-HD4 Trial","Abstract 445 Background. In newly diagnosed myeloma patients, bortezomib treatment induces high rates of complete response (CR) and very good partial response (VGPR). Recently, we published the clustering of gene expression profiles in 320 MM patients, who were included in a large prospective, randomized, phase III transplantation trial with bortezomib (PAD) versus conventional vincristine (VAD) based induction treatment (HOVON65/GMMG-HD4). We identified 12 distinct subgroups CD-1, CD-2, MF, MS, PR, HY, LB, Myeloid, including three novel defined subgroups NFÎºB, CTA, and PRL3 and a subgroup with no clear gene expression profile (NP). Aim. To look at the prognostic impact of these 12 clusters in the trial and group clusters together into a high risk (HR) and low risk (LR) group in the different treatment arms. Furthermore, to define a high risk signature to identify the patients at increased risk of disease progression. Methods. Gene expression profiles of myeloma cells obtained at diagnosis of 320 HOVON65/GMMG-HD4 patients were available. Response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data were available for the first 628 patients, resulting in analysis of gene expression in relation to prognosis in 229 patients. The prognostic impact of the genetic subgroups separately and grouped into high and low risk were evaluated using Kaplan Meier and Cox regression analysis using exhaustive search (R). For the high risk gene signature the HOVON65 gene expression data was used as training set with PFS as outcome measure. Two independent myeloma datasets with survival data were used as an external validation, UAMS (GSE2658) and APEX (GSE9782)). The signature was generated by a Cox proportional hazard model in combination with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkages and Selection Operator) for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection using the R package glmnet. ISS stage was implemented by adjusting the individual covariant penalization factors of the LASSO. Results. The highest CR+nCR rates were found in the PRL3 and NP clusters, i.e. 78% and 86%, respectively (VAD), and 100% (PAD). The lowest CR+nCR rate was 17% in the CD1 cluster (PAD) and 0% in the CD2, MF and PR clusters (VAD). Based on the impact of clusters on PFS and OS in the VAD arm, the MS, MF, PR and CTA clusters were included into a High Risk (HR) group. This HR group showed a median PFS of 13 months and OS of 21 months vs. the Low Risk (LR) group consisting of the remainder of clusters with a median PFS of 31 months and a median OS not reached (P Conclusion. Distinctive gene expression clusters affect prognosis, which differ depending on treatment. In the conventional treatment arm (VAD), MS, MF, PR and CTA clusters confer a worse prognosis while with bortezomib based treatment, only the PR cluster affects prognosis negatively. These HR groups remain independent poor prognostic indicators. Based on the HOVON65/GMMG-HD4 study population, a high-risk signature was generated with strong and highly significant predicting ability in two independent data sets.

General solutions to the single vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries,"The single vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries (SVRPPD) is defined on a graph in which pickup and delivery demands are associated with the customer vertices. The problem consists of designing a least cost route for a vehicle of capacity Q. Each customer is allowed to be visited once for a combined pickup and delivery, or twice if these two operations are performed separately. This article proposes a mixed integer linear programming model for the SVRPPD. It introduces the concept of general solution which encompasses known solution shapes such as Hamiltonian, double-path and lasso. Classical construction and improvement heuristics, as well as a tabu search heuristic, are developed and tested over several instances. Computational results show that the best solutions generated by the heuristics are frequently non-Hamiltonian and may contain up to two customers visited twice.",2007,Eur. J. Oper. Res.
Hypothalamic Arginine Vasotocin mRNA Abundance Variation Across Sexes and with Sex Change in a Coral Reef Fish,"Gonadal hormones are important mediators of sexual and aggressive behavior in vertebrates. Recent evidence suggests that the peptide hormones arginine vasotocin (AVT) and its mammalian homologue arginine vasopressin (AVP) often critically mediate these gonadal hormone effects on behavior and have direct influences on behavioral variation. Behavioral differences between sexes, across reproductive states, and even among closely related species are correlated with differences in central AVT/AVP systems in many species. We report differences in hypothalamic AVT mRNA levels between distinct alternate male phenotypes and with female-to-male sex change in the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), a teleost fish. The aggressively dominant and strongly courting male phenotype has greater numbers of AVT mRNA producing cells in the magnocellular preoptic area of the hypothalamus than females. Levels of AVT mRNA within these cells in dominant males are also approximately three times female levels whereas the non-aggressive male phenotype has AVT mRNA levels approximately twice female levels. Behavioral sex change is very rapid in this species and is not dependent on the presence of gonads. Conversely, rapid increases in sexual and aggressive behavior during sex change are closely paralleled by approximate fourfold increases in hypothalamic AVT-mRNA levels. The behavioral plasticity shown by bluehead wrasses in response to social environment might be mediated in part by a neuropeptide, AVT, with changes in the gonads and gonadal hormones as the result rather than the cause of behavioral dominance.",2000,"Brain, Behavior and Evolution"
Process Fault Isolation via Bayesian Lasso-based Reconstruction Analysis,"Abstract In multivariate statistical process monitoring, fault isolation is an important step that identifies the process variables critical to the detected abnormality. Conventionally, contribution plots are the most popular tools for fault isolation, but they often suffer from the smearing effect and give misleading results. Reconstruction analysis is another commonly used technique. Despite its effectiveness, the original reconstruction analysis method relies on the impractical requirement of a sufficient amount of historical fault data or the complete information of candidate fault directions. Recently, the reconstruction analysis technique has been integrated with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) to overcome its inherent shortcoming. In that research, the task of reconstruction analysis is reformulated as a Lasso problem, and the faulty variables are indicated by the nonzero point estimates of the Lasso coefficients. As well known, a point estimate does not provide any information about its accuracy and is likely to be affected by the quality of the collected data. In this paper, a Bayesian Lasso approach is utilized to solve the problem mentioned above, which assigns independent Laplace (a.k.a. double exponential) priors to the Lasso coefficients and derives the interval estimates by Gibbs sampling from the Bayesian posterior distribution. Such interval estimates can guide fault isolation by conducting statistical hypothesis tests. In addition, the Bayesian framework facilities the tracking of fault propagation path, thereby benefiting the subsequent root-cause diagnosis step.",2017,
Variable selection via the weighted group lasso for factor analysis models,"We consider the problem of selecting variables in factor analysis models. The regularization procedure is introduced to perform an automatic variable selection. In the factor analysis model, each variable is controlled by multiple factors when there are more than one underlying factor. We treat parameters corresponding to the multiple factors as grouped parameters, and then apply the group lasso. Furthermore, the weight of the group lasso penalty is modified to obtain appropriate estimates and improve the performance of variable selection. Crucial issues in this modeling procedure include the selection of the number of factors and a regularization parameter. Choosing these parameters can be viewed as a model selection and evaluation problem. We derive a model selection criterion for evaluating the factor analysis model via the weighted group lasso. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. A real data example is also given to illustrate our procedure.

The antibacterial threaded-lasso peptide capistruin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase.,"Capistruin, a ribosomally synthesized, post-translationally modified peptide produced by Burkholderia thailandensis E264, efficiently inhibits growth of Burkholderia and closely related Pseudomonas strains. The functional target of capistruin is not known. Capistruin is a threaded-lasso peptide (lariat peptide) consisting of an N-terminal ring of nine amino acids and a C-terminal tail of 10 amino acids threaded through the ring. The structure of capistruin is similar to that of microcin J25 (MccJ25), a threaded-lasso antibacterial peptide that is produced by some strains of Escherichia coli and targets DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here, we show that capistruin, like MccJ25, inhibits wild type E. coli RNAP but not mutant, MccJ25-resistant, E. coli RNAP. We show further that an E. coli strain resistant to MccJ25, as a result of a mutation in an RNAP subunit gene, exhibits resistance to capistruin. The results indicate that the structural similarity of capistruin and MccJ25 reflects functional similarity and suggest that the functional target of capistruin, and possibly other threaded-lasso peptides, is bacterial RNAP.",2011,Journal of molecular biology
Jackknife Model Averaging Prediction Methods for Complex Phenotypes with Gene Expression Levels by Integrating External Pathway Information,"Motivation
In the past few years many prediction approaches have been proposed and widely employed in high dimensional genetic data for disease risk evaluation. However, those approaches typically ignore in model fitting the important group structures that naturally exists in genetic data.


Methods
In the present study, we applied a novel model-averaging approach, called jackknife model averaging prediction (JMAP), for high dimensional genetic risk prediction while incorporating pathway information into the model specification. JMAP selects the optimal weights across candidate models by minimizing a cross validation criterion in a jackknife way. Compared with previous approaches, one of the primary features of JMAP is to allow model weights to vary from 0 to 1 but without the limitation that the summation of weights is equal to one. We evaluated the performance of JMAP using extensive simulation studies and compared it with existing methods. We finally applied JMAP to four real cancer datasets that are publicly available from TCGA.


Results
The simulations showed that compared with other existing approaches (e.g., gsslasso), JMAP performed best or is among the best methods across a range of scenarios. For example, among 14 out of 16 simulation settings with PVEâ€‰=â€‰0.3, JMAP has an average of 0.075 higher prediction accuracy compared with gsslasso. We further found that in the simulation, the model weights for the true candidate models have much smaller chances to be zero compared with those for the null candidate models and are substantially greater in magnitude. In the real data application, JMAP also behaves comparably or better compared with the other methods for continuous phenotypes. For example, for the COAD, CRC, and PAAD datasets, the average gains of predictive accuracy of JMAP are 0.019, 0.064, and 0.052 compared with gsslasso.


Conclusion
The proposed method JMAP is a novel model-averaging approach for high dimensional genetic risk prediction while incorporating external useful group structures into the model specification.",2019,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine
Optimal compression and energy confinement of optical Airy bullets,"We report on an approach to generate non-diffractive and non-dispersive Airy bullets with enhanced spatio-temporal energy confinement. By appropriately reshaping the initial spectral components in the Fourier domain, the resulting optical bullets show a significant enhancement of their central lobe intensity while exhibiting a reduced spatiotemporal outspread of the surrounding sub-lobes typical of Airy bullets. Numerically, we demonstrate that when propagating in dispersive media within a linear regime, such optimized Airy bullets maintain the peculiar properties of their â€œstandardâ€ counterparts, including curved trajectories, non-spreading features and self-healing. We foresee direct applications in novel and non-disruptive optical techniques for imaging, tomography and spatio-temporally resolved spectroscopy. References and links 1. Y.

Ancient lakes as evolutionary reservoirs: evidence from the thalassoid gastropods of Lake Tanganyika,"Ancient lakes are often collectively viewed as evolutionary hot spots of diversification. East Africa's Lake Tanganyika has long been the subject of scientific interest owing to dramatic levels of endemism in species as diverse as cichlid fishes, paludomid gastropods, decapod and ostracod crustaceans and poriferans. It is the largest and deepest of the African rift lakes, and its endemic fauna has been presented with a stable inland environment for over 10 Myr, offering unique opportunities for withinâ€“lake diversification. Although astonishing diversification has been documented in the endemic cichlid fauna of the lake, similar patterns of rapid diversification have long been assumed for other groups. In contrast to this hypothesis of rapid speciation, we show here that there has been no acceleration in the rate of speciation in the thalassoid gastropods of the lake following lake colonization. While limited withinâ€“lake speciation has occurred, the dramatic conchological diversity of gastropods presently found within the lake has evolved from at least four major lineages that preâ€“date its formation by as much as 40 Myr. At the same time, a widespread group of African gastropods appears to have evolved from taxa presently found in the lake. While Lake Tanganyika has been a cradle of speciation for cichlid fishes, it has also been an important evolutionary reservoir of gastropod lineages that have been extirpated outside the basin.",2004,Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Graph-guided joint prediction of class label and clinical scores for the Alzheimerâ€™s disease,"AbstractAccurate diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment, is very important for early treatment. Over the last decade, various machine learning methods have been proposed to predict disease status and clinical scores from brain images. 
It is worth noting that many features extracted from brain images are correlated significantly. In this case, feature selection combined with the additional correlation information among features can effectively improve classification/regression performance. Typically, the correlation information among features can be modeled by the connectivity of an undirected graph, where each node represents one feature and each edge indicates that the two involved features are correlated significantly. In this paper, we propose a new graph-guided multi-task learning method incorporating this undirected graph information to predict multiple response variables (i.e., class label and clinical scores) jointly. Specifically, based on the sparse undirected feature graph, we utilize a new latent group Lasso penalty to encourage the correlated features to be selected together. Furthermore, this new penalty also encourages the intrinsic correlated tasks to share a common feature subset. To validate our method, we have performed many numerical studies using simulated datasets and the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Compared with the other methods, our proposed method has very promising performance.",2015,Brain Structure and Function
Hepatocellular carcinoma: radiomics nomogram on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging for early postoperative recurrence prediction,"BackgroundThis study was performed to prospectively develop and validate a radiomics nomogram for predicting postoperative early recurrence (â‰¤1â€‰year) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using whole-lesion radiomics features on preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images.MethodsIn total, 155 patients (training cohort: nâ€‰=â€‰108; validation cohort: nâ€‰=â€‰47) with surgically confirmed HCC were enrolled in this IRB-approved prospective study. Three-dimensional whole-lesion regions of interest were manually delineated along the tumour margins on multi-sequence MR images. Radiomics features were generated and selected to build a radiomics score using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. Clinical characteristics and qualitative imaging features were identified by two independent radiologists and combined to establish a clinical-radiological nomogram. A radiomics nomogram comprising the radiomics score and clinical-radiological risk factors was constructed based on multivariable logistic regression analysis. Diagnostic performance and clinical usefulness were measured by receiver operation characteristic (ROC) and decision curves.ResultsIn total, 14 radiomics features were selected to construct the radiomics score. For the clinical-radiological nomogram, the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, gross vascular invasion and non-smooth tumour margin were included. The radiomics nomogram integrating the radiomics score with clinical-radiological risk factors showed better discriminative performance (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.844, 95%CI, 0.769 to 0.919) than the clinical-radiological nomogram (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.796, 95%CI, 0.712 to 0.881; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.045), with increased clinical usefulness confirmed using a decision curve analysis.ConclusionsIncorporating multiple predictive factors, the radiomics nomogram demonstrated great potential in the preoperative prediction of early HCC recurrence after surgery.",2019,Cancer Imaging

The development of a soccer-specific high-intensity intermittent running protocol,"Recovery from high-intensity exercise in soccer is very important for players to be able to cope with the physical demands of match-play. Evaluation of soccer players ability to perform repeated high-intensity running should therefore be of particular importance to coaches. The aim of this thesis was to develop and apply a high-intensity intermittent running protocol where sub-maximal and maximal components of soccer-specific endurance could be assessed. In Study 1 and Study 2, initial pilot work on the 15-50 protocol and then the 15-30 protocol, two high-intensity intermittent running protocols, were examined for reliability and physiological responses. It was reported that a large learning bias was present in both protocols reflected by performance improvements between trials. These improvements were supported by an improved running economy on the test. The physical load was higher in the maximal stage compared to the sub-maximal stage in both protocols with both aerobic and anaerobic energy production highly simulated as a result of a manipulation of the exercise and rest periods from the sub-maximal stage. It was concluded that several familiarisation sessions were needed on both protocols especially for recreational players to remove any learning bias. The structure of the 15-50 protocol may restrict its application to soccer and may be more suitable as an interval conditioning drill than as a test. The structure and the physiological responses in the 15-30 protocol make it a more practical assessment of soccer-specific endurance. The relationship between the 15-30 protocol and physical performance during match-play, soccer-specific field test performances and aerobic endurance measurements in young professional soccer players was examined in Study 3. There was no relationship between any of the soccer-specific field tests and indices of physical performance during match-play. A significant correlation was reported between maximal oxygen consumption and distance covered in the maximal stage of the 15-30 protocol. No relationship was found between other standardised field tests used in soccer and the 15-30 protocol. It was concluded that physical performance during match-play is highly variable which makes evaluation of the physical capacity of soccer players very difficult. Maximal high-intensity exercise performance was highly influenced by maximal aerobic power. It is plausible that higher aerobic endurance would have facilitated a rapid recovery between high-intensity bouts in the maximal stage. In Study 4 and Study 5, the sensitivity of the 15-30 protocol to pre-season and in-season training periods was investigated. The in-season training period consisted of weekly additional aerobic interval training. Expected improvements in performance were observed at the end of the six-week pre-season training period in both the 15-30 protocol and the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test in young professional soccer players. Small increases in maximal oxygen consumption as well as a greater increase in 15-30 protocol performance were also reported after the in-season training. It was concluded that significant physiological adaptations can be obtained as a result of soccer-specific training periods during the season. The physiological adaptations are more likely to be attributed to peripheral factors than central factors. A new unique high-intensity intermittent running protocol has been developed during these studies. The physiological mechanisms which govern test performance seem to be different from responses to other soccer-specific field tests. Evaluation of soccer-specific endurance performance is complex since physical performance is influenced by numerous variables.

Formation of prismatic loops in AlN and GaN under nanoindentation,"Abstract The formation of prismatic loops in metals has been studied extensively, but the corresponding research related to ceramics can rarely be found in the literature. In this article, the formation of prismatic loops in B4 ceramics under nanoindentation were investigated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The indentation directions are respectively in the normal of the basal plane and the two prismatic planes in AlN and GaN single crystals. Two mechanisms for the formation of prismatic loop in B4 ceramics are found. One is the â€œlassoâ€-like mechanism, which is similar to that observed in metals, and the other is â€œnested-loopsâ€ mechanism, which has never been reported in the literature. MD simulations show that the screw segments of the two different shear loops, be adjacent to each other, can intersect with each other and finally produce a prismatic dislocation loop. The pile-up symmetry after unloading, associated with dislocation loops propagation, can be found, which is consistent with experimental results. More detailed analysis of dislocation patterns and directions indicate that plastic deformation is dominated by the shuffle-set dislocations along 1 3 ã€ˆ 11 2 Â¯ 0 ã€‰ , and the glide-set dislocations along 1 3 ã€ˆ 1 Â¯ 010 ã€‰ are asymmetric.",2017,Acta Materialia
"Fostering locality in global value chains: Potential of small-scale milk processors to increase local milk sourcing, create employment and reduce milk powder imports in Burkina Faso","Imported milk powder has become an essential part of the dairy value chain in urban West Africa, where local milk is little consumed. In Burkina Faso, two diverging policy orientations have emerged to increase the use of locally produced milk: one promoting industrial-scale milk processing and the other supporting small-scale milk processors. This study investigates the potential of small-scale milk processors to source more local milk in the future and the impacts such increase is expected to have both on local employment and milk powder imports. The data were collected and analysed through mixed methods. This includes a survey among 39 milk processors in Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou, three in-depth case studies as well as interviews with other value chain actors, statistical significance tests and qualitative interview analysis. The results suggest that in Bobo-Dioulasso, local milk represents only 11 % of dairy products produced by small-scale milk processors, the rest being made of milk powder. The potential to increase the current volume is very limited without assistance. This is due to challenges specific to local milk sourcing (e.g. lower profitability of local milk compared to milk powder during the dry season) or common among microentrepreneurs more widely (e.g. economic insecurity). Expanding local milk sourcing could have positive impacts on local employment. In this study, it appears to generate two times more employment than milk powder processing. However, increasing local milk sourcing in small-scale processing units can hardly curb the high level of imported milk powder. Local milk is not necessarily used as a substitute for milk powder and small-scale units account for only a limited part of national imports. (Resume d'auteur)",2017,
Class-count reduction techniques for content adaptive filtering,"In the field of image/video enhancement, content adaptive filtering has shown superior performance over fixed linear filtering. The content adaptive filtering, first classifies the local image content based on different image features, such as structure and contrast. Then in every class, a least mean square (LMS) optimal filter is applied. A disadvantage of the concept is that many classes may be redundant, which leads to an inefficient implementation. In this paper, we propose and evaluate various class-count reduction techniques based on classoccurrence frequency, coefficient similarity and error advantage, which can greatly simplify the implementation without sacrificing much performance.",2009,

Corneal suture for the correction of hyperopia following radial keratotomy.,"PURPOSE
To report the visual and refractive changes observed after double concentric corneal suture to correct hyperopic shift after radial keratotomy (RK).


METHODS
This retrospective consecutive case series comprised 17 eyes (15 patients) that underwent two concentric corneal sutures (modified Grene Lasso suture) to correct hyperopic shift after RK. All surgeries were performed by the same surgeon between 2000 and 2003.


RESULTS
The mean time after RK was 11.6 +/- 3.2 years. The mean follow-up was 20.3 +/- 11.3 months. The spherical equivalent refraction was reduced from a preoperative mean of +4.38 +/- 2.87 diopters (D) to -0.54 +/- 2.59 D at last postoperative follow-up (P < .001). No statistically significant difference was observed in mean refractive astigmatism before and after the corneal suture (P = .15). Before surgery, no eye presented with best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) > or = 20/20. At final follow-up, 3 (17.6%) eyes attained this level. Seven (41.2%) eyes improved their BSCVA by > or = 2 Snellen lines. One (5.9%) eye lost 2 Snellen lines of BSCVA.


CONCLUSIONS
Corneal suture can be used to correct RK-induced hyperopia, improving the corneal asphericity in an attempt to stabilize these corneas. It appeared to be effective even for high degrees of hyperopia and in cases with associated irregular astigmatism or open incisions.",2007,Journal of refractive surgery
A Forgotten Geographer of the Early Neapolitan 1800s,"The paper focuses on Luigi Maria Galanti, a Neapolitan geographer of the first Nineteenth Century, who is almost unknown, because he was considered a follower of reformist period. He is the representative of novel age of the Naples geography, whose specificity should be investigated. Therefore we analyze the complex cultural climate of the early 1800s in Naples. Then the formation and the background of L. Galanti are illustrated, and the most important essays â€“ Geografia elementare and Geografia fisica e politica â€“ are studied in details. Galanti emerges as a key figure of the Neapolitan geography and, besides performing a formative role at the University and Polytechnic School, has the merit of the spreading of thoughts over geographical themes in the Neapolitan environment. The early 1800s in Naples : the cultural climate. Under a historical and cultural point of view, early 1880s are a complex period for Naples and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies; it begins with the first Restoration, which has to cope with the Neapolitan Revolution of 1799; it experiences a brief but intense stage of fervour and renewal with the French Decade (1806-1815); it deals with the second Restoration with the uprisings of 1820-21 and 1848 harsh forms of repression and innovation attempts. In such a problematic context, which will dissolve into the new unified Italy, the intellectual class takes a similarly complex attitude. It is continuously referring to the Giambattista Vico and Antonio Genovesi's eminence, putting much effort into spreading their greatness outside the Neapolitan borders, although the power of the Enlightenment spirit is growing weaker here, while Romanticism is long in spreading at least until 1830 (Sansone, 1981, pp. 22-23), when it becomes clearer and more and more pressing the interest for what is happening in Europe (Galasso, Romeo, 1991). Such an orientation also reflects on philosophical studies; in fact the first three decades of 1800s are characterized by different intents trying to cluster around the French eclecticism, while the Kantian thinking is slow to infiltrate, at least not until the studies of Pasquale Galluppi and Ottavio Colecchi (Tessitore, 1981; Cacciatore, 1983). A varying cultural climate is thus outlined, in which historical studies clearly emerge because the intellectual class measures up against the recent conflicts, beginning with Vincenzo Cuoco and his Saggio storico sulla rivoluzione napoletana del 1799. He, who considers history as the science par excellence, identifies three points education, politics and morals about which discusses a large number of scholars who keeps high the Neapolitan historiography profile (Biscardi, 2003; Tessitore, 2002). Thus Cuoco can Â«introduce a series of very important issues, both in the Milan culture and in that of Naples, which will lead to a deep maturation of those conceptions regarding the human being and his awareness of living in a society he is a part ofÂ» (Martirano, 2009, p. 32). Therefore such a slant is the answer, albeit theoretical, to the hard political troubles of Southern Italy. However, a more marked attention to history seems to make the Genovesi lesson go forgotten: he had Unofficial English version provided by the author of the Italian paper published in: BOLLETTINO DELLA SOCIETÃ€ GEOGRAFICA ITALIANA ROMA Serie XIII, vol. VII (2014), pp. 621-636 given importance to geography, showing its epistemological effectiveness as for Â«Southern Italy which was to achieve a new exposure to the eyes of rulers and intellectuals Â» (Sarno, 2012b, p. 224). Genovesi values geography in the range of Enlightenment, aiming at building a new political-economical project for the Kingdom of Naples, a project shared with Ferdinando Galiani, Giuseppe Maria Galanti, Francesco Longano. It's in the last decades of 1700s in fact that G.M. Galanti's Descrizione geografica e politica delle Sicile takes shape, the Reale Officio Topografico becomes operative for want of Galiani and Longano's reformist ideas come into practice. Vincenzo Cuoco himself is committed in turning Genovesi's teachings into political action, while the academic institutionalization of geography begins at the University of Naples. However, this time of geography seems to dissolve as well as that of other sciences. Nevertheless, recent studies are trying to retrace orientation maps, schools, institutions, biographies in order to put into frame the different sciences and tendencies here followed, thus bringing to light again experiences and studies now fallen into oblivion (Mazzola, 2009; Capaccioli, Longo, 2004). The reasons for this are probably various: the attention for historiography has overshadowed other fields and circulation of Southern Italy books has always been limited. In addition, Unity has thwarted local paths raising the need for a common language among Italian scholars: a call, whose promoter is the Neapolitan geographer Ferdinando De Luca himself for example (Baldacci, 1975). Therefore geography is affected by these problems even though it had been relevant during the reformist period and in particular one can observe a real oblivion for the geographer Luigi Maria Galanti, who is nevertheless dominating the Neapolitan scene with his educational commitment and his publications between 1805 and 1836. This is why it seems worthwhile making a first profile of him by lingering over his most important works and focusing on his main themes. The L. Galanti's texts covered here are: Geografia elementare (1814), Istituzioni di geografia fisica e politica (1812) Geografia fisica e politica (1833) and the translation of Pinkerton's Modern Geography (1805). Other useful sources have been the eulogies written for L. Galanti's death by Ulloa (1836) and Filipponi (1836), a review by Ferdinando De Luca (1834) as well as three geography works circulating in the editorial network over the same period: L. C. Federici's Lezioni di geografia (1811), G. Umili's Elementi di geografia antica e moderna per uso dei fanciulli (1816) and C. Bilotta's Geografia elementare per uso dei fanciulli (1830). Luigi Maria Galanti: a life for geography Although unknown today, in 1836 no fewer than two eulogies were written at L. Galanti's death by Pietro CalÃ  Ulloa e Alfonso Filipponi. As written by the former, Luigi Maria Galanti is born on the first day of 1765 at Santa Croce, a town of Molise back then, which later on passed to the Benevento province. At the age of twelve he wears the Benedictine cloth of Montevergine showing a natural tendency for theological studies as well as mathematics and physics. On his turn Alfonso Filipponi, besides remarking the fact he was coy and gentle, points out that L. Galanti delves deeper into both scientific and liberal arts studies as a self-taught and devotes himself not only to old languages but also to English and French. As he grows up, he comes to the decision of being ordained and enjoys a period of meditation between the Montevergine abbey and the Curia Romana from 1777 and 1805. In Rome he is appreciated for a short work, Piano per i monasteri e i conventi della Repubblica napoletana, written in 1799, through which he would like to safeguard ecclesiastical institutions in that historic moment. Outlining his youth, both biographers address the problem of clarifying where the interest for geography comes from. Ulloa stresses out two important experiences: the appointment to the theology lecturer position in Capua and the cooperation to the visit to Southern provinces with his brother Giuseppe Maria for the drafting of the Descrizione. In Capua, L. Galanti discovers his vocation for Unofficial English version provided by the author of the Italian paper published in: BOLLETTINO DELLA SOCIETÃ€ GEOGRAFICA ITALIANA ROMA Serie XIII, vol. VII (2014), pp. 621-636 teaching and up against the scarce knowledge of his pupils he decides to educate them to letters, mathematics and geography; on the other hand, travelling across the provinces of the Kingdom, he begins to take Â«great care for geographical studiesÂ» (Ulloa, 1836, p. 4). Troubles of Southern Italy and the need in common with his brother for identifying their causes and solutions make geography fundamental to L. Galanti's eyes, who thus comes in touch with the above-mentioned Genovesi's disciples and companions. Furthermore it is interesting the fact according to which he wanted to correct the ignorance in geography of his pupils. Filipponi, on his turn, while describing the L. Galanti's juvenile fervour for studies, addresses the same problem and introduces another hypothesis: the scholar picks up geography because he holds it as the discipline capable of explaining Â«the very dark clouds that lock up the sky of EuropeÂ» and Â«the true causes for the foul deeds which reduced Europe to a circus of beastsÂ» (Filipponi, 1836, p. 6). It is in fact Â«the science conceived to suddenly connect the extreme places of a pole to the other's; it is the one that addresses the commerce (...) and sheds the light upon the driving force of peoples and governments; (...), after all, geography too shows in its eternal instability how furious passions turn into ruins and ashes, solitudes and wastelands the most prosperous citiesÂ» (Ibid., p. 7). Geography allows to understand the territorializing processes of peoples, but most importantly how men reshape Earth's landscapes with their frequently violent actions. The thought is strictly linked to the moment it's written, though the reference to commerce is a clear heritage from the Genovesi's Lezioni di Commercio. Therefore L. Galanti chooses this discipline because it offers keys of interpretation for the contemporary world he lives in and because of an epistemological urge, shared with others scholars, to understand their times and the instability of human events. However, he is not looking for an answer just for himself but also for the education of youths that seems important to him after the Cap",2015,
Using machine learning to model problematic smartphone use severity: The significant role of fear of missing out.,"We examined a model of psychopathology variables, age and sex as correlates of problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity using supervised machine learning in a sample of Chinese undergraduate students. A sample of 1097 participants completed measures querying demographics, and psychological measures of PSU, depression and anxiety symptoms, fear of missing out (FOMO), and rumination. We used several different machine learning algorithms to train our statistical model of age, sex and the psychological variables in modeling PSU severity, trained using many simulated replications on a random subset of participants, and externally tested on the remaining subset of participants. Shrinkage algorithms (lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression) performing slightly but statistically better than other algorithms. Results from the training subset generalized to the test subset, without substantial worsening of fit using traditional fit indices. FOMO had the largest relative contribution in modeling PSU severity when adjusting for other covariates in the model. Results emphasize the significance of FOMO to the construct of PSU.",2019,Addictive behaviors
Patterns of nematode diversity at hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise,"The diversity and abundance of meiofauna in quasi-quantitative samples collected from Bathymodiolus mussel beds in a deep-sea hydrothermal vent field on the East Pacific Rise (EPR) was studied with particular reference to nematodes. Copepods, polychaetes and nematodes were found to be the most abundant meiofaunal taxa at all sites processed so far. Species richness (S = 4 â€“ 6), Shannon-Wiener diversity indices (Hâ€™log e = 0.9 â€“ 1.5) and Pielouâ€™s eveness indices (Jâ€™ = 0.5 â€“ 0.8) were similar at all sites. Six different species of nematode were identified, both sites exhibiting a dominance of Monhystrid species. Cluster analysis of Bray-Curtis similarities using group-average linkage on standardised data shows that samples from Train Station and East Wall separate out at around the 45% similarity level. This separation results from the different abundances of nematode species present at both sites and the exclusive presence of Thalassomonhystera sp. B at Train Station and Anticoma sp. A at East Wall. A pot sample from a mussel bed at â€œOasisâ€ at 17 deg 25â€™ S on the EPR exhibits approximately 30% similarity with the NEPR samples as a result of higher abundance and species richness of nematodes. To date, meiofauna have seldom been included in ecological studies at vents and it is therefore not clear to whether patterns of faunal zonation and biogeography similar to those known in megafauna are also present in this size class. Future work may reveal possible large-scale variation in nematode species richness.",2006,Cahiers De Biologie Marine
On the Practice of Rescaling Covariates,"Whether doing parametric or nonparametric regression with shrinkage, thresholding, penalized likelihood, Bayesian posterior estimators (e.g., ""ridge regression, lasso, principal component regression, waveshrink"" or ""Markov random field""), it is common practice to rescale covariates by dividing by their respective standard errors Ï. The stated goal of this operation is to provide unitless covariates to compare like with like, especially when penalized likelihood or prior distributions are used. We contend that this vision is too simplistic. Instead, we propose to take into account a more essential component of the structure of the regression matrix by rescaling the covariates based on the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix Î£ of the maximum-likelihood estimator. We illustrate the differences between the standard Ï- and proposed Î£-rescalings with various estimators and data sets. Copyright (c) 2008 The Author.

"""variaÃ§Ã£o Temporal Da Meiofauna E Da Nematofauna Em Uma Ãrea MediolitorÃ¢nea Da Bacia Do Pina (pernambuco, Brasil)""","The basin of Pina has been studied for many years in order to check the level of organic pollutants. Many rivers are discharged in this basin bringing a big amount of pollutants to it. This affects the quality of organisms fished by the poor population that lives in the neighborhood. Up to now thereâ€™s only one studie on meiofauna, specifically on nematofauna, carried out at this place, despite of its great role for the benthic trophic net. Biosedimentic samples were taken weekly during 3 months at the low pluviosity phase (January, February and March) and 3 months at the high pluviosity (June, July and August) of 1999 in a fixed transect at intertidal area, with 5 random replications, making a total of 120 samples. It was used a corer of 5 cm length and 2.5 cm of internal diameter. Temperature was measured and sediments were taken for granulometric and organic matter analyses. Monthly, on the lowest tide day, water was collected using a bottle of Nanser to verify the amount of dissolved oxygen (BOD) and salinity to follow the variation of polluting loaded in the estuary. The Nematoda were mounted in permanent slides and identified, moreover the population and trophic structures were defined. Statistical programs were used to correlate the non-biotic factors with the meiofauna and the nematofauna. Using the same methodology meiofauna and sediments were collected in 10 sample points covering the entire basin. Qualitatively the meiofauna composition was the same for the two studied phases, composed by 10 taxa: Turbellaria, Gastrotricha, Nematoda, Rotifera, Tardigrada, Polychaeta, Oligochaeta, Acari, Ostracoda e Copepoda. The highest monthly average for the meiofauna was in March (3126.5 ind. 10cm) with 90% composed by Nematoda and the lowest was in August (1291.15 ind.10 cm) with 97% Nematoda. Weekly the highest density was recorded at the last week of June (4785.2 ind. 10 cm) with 84% composed by Nematoda while the lowest was recorded at the first week of January (453.25 ind. 10 cm) with 63% Nematoda. The nematofauna was composed by three orders: Enoplida, with trhee families and four genus, Chromadorida, with five families and thirteen genus and Monhysterida, with five families and ten genus. The genera found were: Anoplostoma, Astonema, Axonolaimus. Chromadorita, Chromaspirinia, Daptonema, Desmodora, Halalaimus, Halichoanolaimus, Linhomoeus, Marylynnia, Metachromadora, Oncholaimus, Paracanthonchus, Paracyatholaimus, Paramonohystera, Parodontophora, Pomponema, Prochromadorella, Pseudochromadora, Sabatieria, Spirinia, Terschellingia, Thalassomonystera, Theristus, Tricotheristus e Viscosia. The temporal pattern showed the rainy phase with highest densities, positively correlated to organic matter and grains arrangement. The new species Spirinia n.sp. was very resistant to the physical-chemical conditions of the studied environment, since it was dominant during almost all period of this survey, except when the rain levels lowered (end of July and beginning of August). When this happens Therschelingia and Daptonema change this dominance. The amount of organic matter observed reflects itself on the community structure but there is a combination of effects with the granulometry acting independent of the climatic phase. The dynamic of the non-biotic parameters in an estuary allied with the rapidity of morphological changing of the Nematoda to survive in extreme environments confirms the importance of weekly monitoring this community in order to have more precise answers about these organisms so important in brackish environments.",2003,
Structured sparse canonical correlation analysis for brain imaging genetics: an improved GraphNet method,"MOTIVATION
Structured sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) models have been used to identify imaging genetic associations. These models either use group lasso or graph-guided fused lasso to conduct feature selection and feature grouping simultaneously. The group lasso based methods require prior knowledge to define the groups, which limits the capability when prior knowledge is incomplete or unavailable. The graph-guided methods overcome this drawback by using the sample correlation to define the constraint. However, they are sensitive to the sign of the sample correlation, which could introduce undesirable bias if the sign is wrongly estimated.


RESULTS
We introduce a novel SCCA model with a new penalty, and develop an efficient optimization algorithm. Our method has a strong upper bound for the grouping effect for both positively and negatively correlated features. We show that our method performs better than or equally to three competing SCCA models on both synthetic and real data. In particular, our method identifies stronger canonical correlations and better canonical loading patterns, showing its promise for revealing interesting imaging genetic associations.

Ipsilateral pulmonary vein isolation performed by a single continuous circular lesion: role of pulmonary vein mapping during ablation.,"AIMS
Complete pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI) can be achieved by continuous circular lesions (CCL) around the ipsilateral pulmonary veins (PVs) guided by a 3D-mapping system. We investigated whether CPVI can be achieved with a single CCL around the isplilateral PVs without recording PV activity during ablation.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Fifty patients with atrial fibrillation underwent ablation of CCLs around ipsilateral PVs guided by 3D mapping. One or two Lasso catheters were placed within the PVs. Lasso tracings were hidden to physicians during ablation. After completion of CCLs, Lasso tracings were evaluated. If PV activation was present, conduction gaps (CGs) were identified and ablated with guidance by the local electrogram and the Lasso catheter(s). In 21 patients (42%), CPVI was achieved after ablation of a single CCL around ipsilateral PVs. Pulmonary vein isolation was achieved in 43 patients (86%) in the right-sided PVs and in 21 patients (42%) in the left-sided PVs. In the remaining patients, there were eight CGs in right-sided CCLs and 40 CGs in left-sided CCLs. Conduction gaps along the left CCLs were found at the ridge between the PV ostia and the left atrial appendage in 27 out of 40 CGs (68%). Mean time from the P-wave onset to the earliest PV potential was 112Â±35 ms in the presence of a CG at the roof, and 166Â±59 ms in patients with CGs at other locations in left-sided CCLs (P<0.05).


CONCLUSION
Complete pulmonary vein isolation is difficult to achieve with a single CCL around ipsilateral PVs without continuous recording of PV activation during ablation.",2011,"Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology"
"Leaf production, shoot demography, and flowering of Thalassodendron ciliatum along the east African coast","Several characteristics of Thalassodendron ciliatum populations were evaluated along the coasts of Kenya and Zanzibar Island, with the aim to study spatial variability in this species. A reconstruction technique, using scars left by abscised leaves and flowers, was employed to determine leaf production, shoot demography, and flowering frequency. Eight subtidal sites in different back-reef lagoons were sampled along with a subtidal site that was not protected by a reef, a site with intertidal rack pools, and a subtidal site in a mangrove bay. Leaf- production rates were lowest for the population of the unprotected subtidal site and for the population from the intertidal rock pools (30 leaves per shoot per year). At these sites, leaf life-span was almost twice as long (94 days). Low leaf-formation rates seem to be compensated by long leaf life- spans to maintain similar numbers of standing leaves per shoot. Highest leaf-production rates were found at the mangrove-bay site (53 leaves per shoot per year). The mangrove-bay population showed internodal lengths of almost 7 mm and stem lengths of almost 90 cm. The stems were two- to four-fold longer than those at the other sites. A short leaf life-span of 51 days at the mangrove site indicates that the investment in stem growth occurs at the expense of leaf maintenance. Median ages of the populations varied almost four-fold from 0.5 to 1.8 years. All meadows showed shoot-recruitment rates that were either the same as or larger than shoot mortality rates, suggesting that the environmental quality in this region is still suitable for sustaining vigorous seagrass vegetation. Flowering frequencies were generally low and seedlings were not found.

Nonregular and Minimax Estimation of Individualized Thresholds in High Dimension with Binary Responses.,"Given a large number of covariates $Z$, we consider the estimation of a high-dimensional parameter $\theta$ in an individualized linear threshold $\theta^T Z$ for a continuous variable $X$, which minimizes the disagreement between $\text{sign}(X-\theta^TZ)$ and a binary response $Y$. While the problem can be formulated into the M-estimation framework, minimizing the corresponding empirical risk function is computationally intractable due to discontinuity of the sign function. Moreover, estimating $\theta$ even in the fixed-dimensional setting is known as a nonregular problem leading to nonstandard asymptotic theory. To tackle the computational and theoretical challenges in the estimation of the high-dimensional parameter $\theta$, we propose an empirical risk minimization approach based on a regularized smoothed loss function. The statistical and computational trade-off of the algorithm is investigated. Statistically, we show that the finite sample error bound for estimating $\theta$ in $\ell_2$ norm is $(s\log d/n)^{\beta/(2\beta+1)}$, where $d$ is the dimension of $\theta$, $s$ is the sparsity level, $n$ is the sample size and $\beta$ is the smoothness of the conditional density of $X$ given the response $Y$ and the covariates $Z$. The convergence rate is nonstandard and slower than that in the classical Lasso problems. Furthermore, we prove that the resulting estimator is minimax rate optimal up to a logarithmic factor. The Lepski's method is developed to achieve the adaption to the unknown sparsity $s$ and smoothness $\beta$. Computationally, an efficient path-following algorithm is proposed to compute the solution path. We show that this algorithm achieves geometric rate of convergence for computing the whole path. Finally, we evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator in simulation studies and a real data analysis.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Feature selection for spatial point processes,"Recent applications such as forestry datasets involve the observations of spatial point pattern data combined with the observation of many spatial covariates. We consider in this thesis the problem of estimating a parametric form of the intensity function in such a context. This thesis develops feature selection procedures and gives some guarantees on their validity. In particular, we propose two different feature selection approaches: the lasso-type methods and the Dantzig selector-type procedures. For the methods considering lasso-type techniques, we derive asymptotic properties of the estimates obtained from estimating functions derived from Poisson and logistic regression likelihoods penalized by a large class of penalties. We prove that the estimates obtained from such procedures satisfy consistency, sparsity, and asymptotic normality. For the Dantzig selector part, we develop a modified version of the Dantzig selector, which we call the adaptive linearized Dantzig selector (ALDS), to obtain the intensity estimates. More precisely, the ALDS estimates are defined as the solution to an optimization problem which minimizes the sum of coefficients of the estimates subject to linear approximation of the score vector as a constraint. We find that the estimates obtained from such methods have asymptotic properties similar to the ones proposed previously using an adaptive lasso regularization term. We investigate the computational aspects of the methods developped using either lasso-type procedures or the Dantzig selector-type approaches. We make links between spatial point processes intensity estimation and generalized linear models (GLMs), so we only have to deal with feature selection procedures for GLMs. Thus, easier computational procedures are implemented and computationally fast algorithm are proposed. Simulation experiments are conducted to highlight the finite sample performances of the estimates from each of two proposed approaches. Finally, our methods are applied to model the spatial locations a species of tree in the forest observed with a large number of environmental factors.",2017,
Pruning the Boosting Ensemble of Decision Trees,"We propose to use variable selection methods based on penalized regression for pruning decision tree ensembles. Pruning methods based on LASSO and SCAD are compared with the cluster pruning method. Comparative studies are performed on some artificial datasets and real datasets. According to the results of comparative studies, the proposed methods based on penalized regression reduce the size of boosting ensembles without decreasing accuracy significantly and have better performance than the cluster pruning method. In terms of classification noise, the proposed pruning methods can mitigate the weakness of AdaBoost to some degree.",2006,Communications for Statistical Applications and Methods
Simultaneous Co-clustering and Learning with Dimensionality Reduction,"In this project, we are interested in solving predictions problems involving dyadic data. The â€œNetflix problemâ€, where data may be organized into a matrix with the rows representing users, the columns representing movies and (some of) the matrix elements containing ratings, is an example of a setting where the data is naturally dyadic. The prediction problem here is essentially to fill in the missing entries of the matrix with predicted ratings. Recently, a technique called simultaneous co-clustering and learning (SCOAL) was proposed that was demonstrated to be effective in solving such dyadic prediction problems. SCOAL is essentially a divide-and-conquer approach that seeks to form clusters of feature vectors and build a separate local model for each one of these clusters. Such an approach inherently suffers from the risk of overfitting, especially when the number of clusters is large. Thus, to alleviate the effects of over-fitting, while at the same time, benefitting from the use of multiple models, we propose the use of dimensionality reduction in conjunction with SCOAL. We investigate two dimensionality reduction techniques: principle components regression and the least absolute shrinkage/selection operator (LASSO). We show that both these techniques provide significant reduction in test error (up to 10% in some settings) when linear predictive models are employed within each cluster.",2012,
Attribute Efficient Linear Regression with Data-Dependent Sampling,"In this paper we analyze a budgeted learning setting, in which the learner can only choose and observe a small subset of the attributes of each training example. We develop efficient algorithms for ridge and lasso linear regression, which utilize the geometry of the data by a novel data-dependent sampling scheme. When the learner has prior knowledge on the second moments of the attributes, the optimal sampling probabilities can be calculated precisely, and result in data-dependent improvements factors for the excess risk over the state-of-the-art that may be as large as $O(\sqrt{d})$, where $d$ is the problem's dimension. Moreover, under reasonable assumptions our algorithms can use less attributes than full-information algorithms, which is the main concern in budgeted learning settings. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithms able to do so in our setting. Where no such prior knowledge is available, we develop a simple estimation technique that given a sufficient amount of training examples, achieves similar improvements. We complement our theoretical analysis with experiments on several data sets which support our claims.",2014,ArXiv
Do Mediterranean fish assemblages associated with marine caves and rocky cliffs differ,"Fish assemblages associated with marine caves and rocky cliffs were investigated in the Salento Peninsula (SE Italy, Mediterranean Sea) by using visual census methods. Sampling was done at three sites, each of which included 4 habitat types: the external and the internal portions of caves, and shallow and deep rocky cliffs. 10 and 13 species were found exclusively inside cave habitats (e.g. Corcyrogobius lichtensteini, Thorogobius ephippiatus and Grammonus ater) or in rocky cliffs (e.g. Diplodus annularis, Sarpa salpa, Sparisoma cretense, Spondyliosoma cantharus), respectively. The four habitat types shared 10 species, and the external portions of the caves shared the most species (both with the internal cave portions and the external rocky cliffs). As a general rule, dissimilarity in the fish assemblage structure between habitats was far greater than dissimilarity between sites. Apogon imberbis (mostly associated with caves) and Chromis chromis (typifying rocky cliffs, mainly the deep ones) mostly contributed to dissimilarities between caves and rocky cliffs. Apogon imberbis (mostly associated with internal caves) and Coris julis (mainly associated to external cave portions) contributed strongly to dissimilarities between internal and external cave portions, while C. chromis, Symphodus mediterraneus and C. julis (associated with the deeper cliffs) and Thalassoma pavo (mostly present in shallow cliffs) differentiated deep and shallow cliffs. Diplodus vulgaris, Oblada melanura and Mullus surmuletus showed a marked increase in density during the cold season in the caves. These results show that fish assemblages associated with rocky reefs rich in marine caves (in terms of relative densities, species composition, species richness, exclusive species and presence of juveniles of some valuable species) may be affected by the peculiar ecological conditions within caves, which could provide additional resources for fishes (e.g. food availability, refuge against predators, sand patches within a rocky matrix) compared to rocky reefs without caves. These results suggest that stretches of rocky coasts rich in marine caves should be considered within management/conservation programs (e.g. when establishing Marine Protected Areas).",2009,Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science
Structure identification and model selection in geographically weighted quantile regression models,"Abstract Geographical weighted quantile regression (GWQR) is an important tool for exploring the spatial non-stationarity of the regression relationship and providing the entire description of the response distribution, which is useful in practice because of its robustness against outliers and flexibility in dealing with non-normal distributions. This paper proposes the GWQlasso method for structure identification and variable selection in GWQR models. The proposed method combines the local-linear estimation of the GWQR model and the adaptive group lasso, which can simultaneously identify spatially varying coefficients, non-zero constant coefficients and zero coefficients. The selection consistency and the oracle property of the proposal are studied. Moreover, the derived algorithm for the GWQlasso method and the selection of the tuning parameter by the BIC criterion are established. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the method.",2018,spatial statistics
Sparse classification using Group Matching Pursuit,"Abstract Group structure exists in supervised learning problems inherently. For example, in the training data of a classification problem, samples from the same class will have similar representations. These samples from the same class will form a group. Group sparse features, such as Group Lasso, can reserve this group information and improve classification accuracy by reducing noise using sparse constraints. However, Group Lasso is a sparse approximation, and its performance and solution highly depend on the choice of group sparse penalty weight. In this paper, we propose a Group Matching Pursuit (GMP) based sparse classification approach. Group Matching Pursuit features are sparse features where coefficients of exact K groups are non-zeros. Compared to Group Lasso, 1. Group Matching Pursuit based classification is stable and has no penalty parameters to tune; 2. Group Matching Pursuit features have large Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and are class discriminant; 3. Group Matching Pursuit features are also robust for occluded images. Extensive experiments on 5 data sets and different levels of occlusion show that the proposed Group Matching Pursuit can improve Group Lasso classification accuracy up to 27.2% in some situation.",2019,Neurocomputing
Variable selection in international diffusion models,"Prior research comes to different conclusions as to what country characteristics drive diffusion patterns. One prime difficulty that may partially explain this divergence between studies is the sparseness of the data, in terms of the periodicity as well as the number of products and countries, in combination with the large number of potentially influential country characteristics. In face of such sparse data, scholars have used nested models, bivariate models and factor models to explore the role of country covariates. This paper uses Bayesian Lasso and Bayesian Elastic Net variable selection procedures as powerful approaches to identify the most important drivers of differences in Bass diffusion parameters across countries. We find that socio-economic and demographic country covariates (most pronouncedly so, economic wealth and education) have the strongest effect on all diffusion metrics we study. Our findings are a call for marketing scientists to devote greater attention to country covariate selection in international diffusion models, as well as to variable selection in marketing models at large.",2014,International Journal of Research in Marketing
Nomogram for predicting severe morbidity after pheochromocytoma surgery,"PURPOSE
Although resection is the primary treatment strategy for pheochromocytoma, surgery is associated with a high risk of morbidity. At present, there is no nomogram for prediction of severe morbidity after pheochromocytoma surgery, thus the aim of the present study was to develop and validate a nomogram for prediction of severe morbidity after pheochromocytoma surgery.


METHODS
The development cohort consisted of 262 patients who underwent unilateral laparoscopic or open pheochromocytoma surgery at our center between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2016. The patients' clinicopathological characters were recorded. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) binary logistic regression model was used for data dimension reduction and feature selection, then multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop the predictive model. An independent validation cohort consisted of 128 consecutive patients from January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018. The performance of the predictive model was assessed in regards to discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness.


RESULTS
Predictors of this model included sex, body mass index, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, tumor size, intraoperative hemodynamic instability, and surgical duration. For the validation cohort, the model showed good discrimination with an AUROC of 0.818 (95% CI, 0.745, 0.891) and good calibration (Unreliability test, p=0.440). Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the model was also clinically useful.


CONCLUSIONS
A nomogram was developed to facilitate the individualized prediction of severe morbidity after pheochromocytoma surgery and may help to improve the perioperative strategy and treatment outcome.",2020,Endocrine Connections
Discovering Study-Specific Gene Regulatory Networks,"Microarrays are commonly used in biology because of their ability to simultaneously measure thousands of genes under different conditions. Due to their structure, typically containing a high amount of variables but far fewer samples, scalable network analysis techniques are often employed. In particular, consensus approaches have been recently used that combine multiple microarray studies in order to find networks that are more robust. The purpose of this paper, however, is to combine multiple microarray studies to automatically identify subnetworks that are distinctive to specific experimental conditions rather than common to them all. To better understand key regulatory mechanisms and how they change under different conditions, we derive unique networks from multiple independent networks built using glasso which goes beyond standard correlations. This involves calculating cluster prediction accuracies to detect the most predictive genes for a specific set of conditions. We differentiate between accuracies calculated using cross-validation within a selected cluster of studies (the intra prediction accuracy) and those calculated on a set of independent studies belonging to different study clusters (inter prediction accuracy). Finally, we compare our method's results to related state-of-the art techniques. We explore how the proposed pipeline performs on both synthetic data and real data (wheat and Fusarium). Our results show that subnetworks can be identified reliably that are specific to subsets of studies and that these networks reflect key mechanisms that are fundamental to the experimental conditions in each of those subsets.",2014,PLoS ONE
Fused Estimation of Sparse Connectivity Patterns From Rest fMRIâ€”Application to Comparison of Children and Adult Brains,"In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating multiple sparse, co-activated brain regions from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) observations belonging to different classes. More precisely, we propose a method to analyze similarities and differences in functional connectivity between children and young adults. Often, analysis is conducted on each class separately, and differences across classes are identified with an additional postprocessing step using adequate statistical tools. Here, we propose to rely on a generalized fused Lasso penalty, which allows us to make use of the entire data set in order to estimate connectivity patterns that are either shared across classes, or specific to a given group. By using the entire population during the estimation, we hope to increase the power of our analysis. The proposed model falls in the category of population-wise matrix decomposition, and a simple and efficient alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is introduced to solve the associated optimization problem. After validating our approach on simulated data, experiments are performed on resting-state fMRI imaging from the Philadelphia neurodevelopmental cohort data set, comprised of normally developing children from ages 8 to 21. Developmental differences were observed in various brain regions, as a total of three class-specific resting-state components were identified. Statistical analysis of the estimated subject-specific features, as well as classification results (based on age groups, up to 81% accuracy,  $n = 583$  samples) related to these components demonstrate that the proposed method is able to properly extract meaningful shared and class-specific sub-networks.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
Compound Identification Using Penalized Linear Regression on Metabolomics.,"Compound identification is often achieved by matching the experimental mass spectra to the mass spectra stored in a reference library based on mass spectral similarity. Because the number of compounds in the reference library is much larger than the range of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) values so that the data become high dimensional data suffering from singularity. For this reason, penalized linear regressions such as ridge regression and the lasso are used instead of the ordinary least squares regression. Furthermore, two-step approaches using the dot product and Pearson's correlation along with the penalized linear regression are proposed in this study.",2016,Journal of modern applied statistical methods : JMASM
Adaptive LASSO for linear mixed model selection via profile log-likelihood,"ABSTRACT Mixed model selection is quite important in statistical literature. To assist the mixed model selection, we employ the adaptive LASSO penalized term to propose a two-stage selection procedure for the purpose of choosing both the random and fixed effects. In the first stage, we utilize the penalized restricted profile log-likelihood to choose the random effects; in the second stage, after the random effects are determined, we apply the penalized profile log-likelihood to select the fixed effects. In each stage, the Newtonâ€“Raphson algorithm is performed to complete the parameter estimation. We prove that the proposed procedure is consistent and possesses the oracle properties. The simulations and a real data application are conducted for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed selection procedure.",2018,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
Evaluation of the Design Effect for Optimizing the Model Discrimination Strength to Detect Non-Zero Interactions in Factorial Experiments,"Author(s): Wales, Brandon Allen | Advisor(s): Ghosh, Subir | Abstract: It is important for a design to be able to discriminate between all pairwise model comparisons when searching for non-zero interactions. If a design does not have this capability, finding non-zero interactions may not be possible. We propose a procedure at analyzing the model discrimination strength when searching for non-zero interactions by understanding the pairwise differenced error sum of squares for a given design. This is done by calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of differenced projection matrices which are completely dependent on the design and not the observed values for the response variable. Using this procedure, we have compared two balanced designs and two Placket-Burman (1946) designs which both have n=12 runs, m=5 factors each with 2 levels, and searching over (5Â¦2)=10 two-factor interaction effects. Additionally, ridge regression and LASSO were used for a model selection approach which both use tuning parameters to calculate the model parameter estimates. All three model selection approaches were used on all four example designs to compare the performance when searching for non-zero interactions.",2017,
Elucidating the Specificity Determinants of the AtxE2 Lasso Peptide Isopeptidase*,"Lasso peptide isopeptidase is an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes the isopeptide bond of lasso peptides, rendering these peptides linear. To carry out a detailed structure-activity analysis of the lasso peptide isopeptidase AtxE2 from Asticcacaulis excentricus, we solved NMR structures of its substrates astexin-2 and astexin-3. Using in vitro enzyme assays, we show that the C-terminal tail portion of these peptides is dispensable with regards to isopeptidase activity. A collection of astexin-2 and astexin-3 variants with alanine substitutions at each position within the ring and the loop was constructed, and we showed that all of these peptides except for one were cleaved by the isopeptidase. Thus, much like the lasso peptide biosynthetic enzymes, lasso peptide isopeptidase has broad substrate specificity. Quantitative analysis of the cleavage reactions indicated that alanine substitutions in loop positions of these peptides led to reduced cleavage, suggesting that the loop is serving as a recognition element for the isopeptidase.",2015,The Journal of Biological Chemistry
Transition-transversion encoding and genetic relationship metric in ReliefF feature selection improves pathway enrichment in GWAS,"BackgroundReliefF is a nearest-neighbor based feature selection algorithm that efficiently detects variants that are important due to statistical interactions or epistasis. For categorical predictors, like genotypes, the standard metric used in ReliefF has been a simple (binary) mismatch difference. In this study, we develop new metrics of varying complexity that incorporate allele sharing, adjustment for allele frequency heterogeneity via the genetic relationship matrix (GRM), and physicochemical differences of variants via a new transition/transversion encoding.MethodsWe introduce a new two-dimensional transition/transversion genotype encoding for ReliefF, and we implement three ReliefF attribute metrics: 1.) genotype mismatch (GM), which is the ReliefF standard, 2.) allele mismatch (AM), which accounts for heterozygous differences and has not been used previously in ReliefF, and 3.) the new transition/transversion metric. We incorporate these attribute metrics into the ReliefF nearest neighbor calculation with a Manhattan metric, and we introduce GRM as a new ReliefF nearest-neighbor metric to adjust for allele frequency heterogeneity.ResultsWe apply ReliefF with each metric to a GWAS of major depressive disorder and compare the detection of genes in pathways implicated in depression, including Axon Guidance, Neuronal System, and G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling. We also compare with detection by Random Forest and Lasso as well as random/null selection to assess pathway size bias.ConclusionsOur results suggest that using more genetically motivated encodings, such as transition/transversion, and metrics that adjust for allele frequency heterogeneity, such as GRM, lead to ReliefF attribute scores with improved pathway enrichment.",2018,BioData Mining
La Folie Baudelaire,"Roberto Calasso is one of the most original and acclaimed of writers on literature, art, culture and mythology. In Baudelaire's Folly, Calasso turns his attention to the poets and writers of Paris in the nineteenth century who created what was later called 'the Modern.' His protagonist is Charles Baudelaire: poet of nerves, art lover, pioneering critic, man about Paris, whose groundbreaking works on modern culture described the ephemeral, fleeting nature of life in the metropolis - and the artist's role in capturing this - as no other writer had done. With Baudelaire's critical intelligence as his inspiration, Calasso ranges through his life and work, focusing on two painters - Ingres and Delacroix - about whom Baudelaire wrote acutely, and then turns to Degas and Manet, who followed in the tracks Baudelaire laid down in his great essay The Painter of Modern Life. In a mosaic of stories, insights, dreams, close readings of poems and commentaries on paintings, Paris in Baudelaire's years comes to life. In the eighteenth century, a 'folie' was a garden pavilion set aside for people of leisure, a place of delight and fantasy. Here Calasso has created a brilliant and dramatic 'Folie Baudelaire': a place where the reader can encounter Baudelaire, his peers, his city, his extraordinary likes and dislikes, and his world, finally discovering that it is nothing less than the land of 'absolute literature'.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic analogues of geological processes a case of burning post-mining dumps as shown by natural samples and thermal experiments,"Introduction Long-term intensive analyzing of a variety of mineral samples from various burning post-mining dumps from Upper and Lower Silesia allowed to find a number of examples, where processes acting in such anthropogenic environment are highly analogous to many geological processes of natural environment. These analogies include the formation of so-called Â“paralavasÂ” (parabasalts, scoria, or rather anatectites), that usually contain both typically metamorphic (indialite, cordierite-sekaninaite, corundum) and magmatic (olivine, tridymite) minerals, as well as spinels and glass. On the other hand, the formation of paralavas and other rocks found on burning heaps is known from natural geological environment like the Hatrurim formation in Israel (Sokol et al. 2005). K-bearing indialite is known from both burning dumps and buchite xenoliths from some volcanic complexes (Schreyer et al. 1990; Balassone et al. 2004).",2013,
"Oracle Properties, Bias Correction, and Inference of the Adaptive Lasso for Time Series Extremum Estimators","We derive new theoretical results on the properties of the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (adaptive lasso) for time series regression models. In particular we investigate the question of how to conduct finite sample inference on the parameters given an adaptive lasso model for some fixed value of the shrinkage parameter. Central in this study is the test of the hypothesis that a given adaptive lasso parameter equals zero, which therefore tests for a false positive. To this end we construct a simple (conservative) testing procedure and show, theoretically and empirically through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, that the adaptive lasso combines efficient parameter estimation, variable selection, and valid finite sample inference in one step. Moreover, we analytically derive a bias correction factor that is able to significantly improve the empirical coverage of the test on the active variables. Finally, we apply the introduced testing procedure to investigate the relation between the short rate dynamics and the economy, thereby providing a statistical foundation (from a model choice perspective) to the classic Taylor rule monetary policy model.",2015,

Extension to mixed models of the Supervised Component-based Generalised Linear Regression,"We address the component-based regularisation of a multivariate Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). A set of random responses Y is modelled by a GLMM, using a set X of explanatory variables, a set T of additional covariates, and random effects used to introduce the dependence between statistical units. Variables in X are assumed many and redundant, so that regression demands regularisation. By contrast, variables in T are assumed few and selected so as to require no regularisation. Regularisation is performed building an appropriate number of orthogonal components that both contribute to model Y and capture relevant structural information in X. To estimate the model, we propose to maximise a criterion specific to the Supervised Component-based Generalised Linear Regression (SCGLR) within an adaptation of Schall's algorithm. This extension of SCGLR is tested on both simulated and real data, and compared to Ridge- and Lasso-based regularisations.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Rejoinder: Post Selection Shrinkage Estimation for High Dimensional Data Analysis,"One fundamental ingredient of our work is to formally split the signals into strong and weak ones. The rationale is that the usual one-step method such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) may be very effective in detecting strong signals while failing to identify some weak ones, which in turn has a significant impact on the model fitting, as well as prediction. The discussions of both Fan and QYY contain very interesting comments on the separation of the three sets of variables. Regarding Assumption (A2) about the weak signal set S2, we admit that the original version was not as rigorous as it could have been, as it could have contained the variables in S3. We now propose the following Assumption (A2') that replaces (A2) in the original paper.",2017,Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry
Selecting Relevant Descriptors for Classification by Bayesian Estimates: A Comparison with Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines Approaches for Disparate Data Sets.,"Classification algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which leads to overfitting, particularly if the problem is over-determined. Therefore it is of particular interest to identify the most relevant descriptors to reduce the complexity. We applied Bayesian estimates to model the probability distribution of descriptors values used for binary classification using n-fold cross-validation. As a measure for the discriminative power of the classifiers, the symmetric form of the Kullback-Leibler divergence of their probability distributions was computed. We found that the most relevant descriptors possess a Gaussian-like distribution of their values, show the largest divergences, and therefore appear most often in the cross-validation scenario. The results were compared to those of the LASSO feature selection method applied to multiple decision trees and support vector machine approaches for data sets of substrates and nonsubstrates of three Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which comprise strongly unbalanced compound distributions. In contrast to decision trees and support vector machines, the performance of Bayesian estimates is less affected by unbalanced data sets. This strategy reveals those descriptors that allow a simple linear separation of the classes, whereas the superior accuracy of decision trees and support vector machines can be attributed to nonlinear separation, which are in turn more prone to overfitting.",2011,Molecular informatics
"Systematics and diversification of Anindobothrium Marques, Brooks & Lasso, 2001 (Eucestoda: Rhinebothriidea)","Tapeworms of the genus Anindobothrium Marques, Brooks & Lasso, 2001 are found in both marine and Neotropical freshwater stingrays of the family Potamotrygonidae. The patterns of host association within the genus support the most recent hypothesis about the history of diversification of potamotrygonids, which suggests that the ancestor of freshwater lineages of the Potamotrygonidae colonized South American river systems through marine incursion events. Despite the relevance of the genus Anindobothrium to understand the history of colonization and diversification of potamotrygonids, no additional efforts were done to better investigate the phylogenetic relationship of this taxon with other lineages of cestodes since its erection. This study is a result of recent collecting efforts to sample members of the genus in marine and freshwater potamotrygonids that enabled the most extensive documentation of the fauna of Anindobothrium parasitizing species of Styracura de Carvalho, Loboda & da Silva, Potamotrygon schroederi FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez, P. orbignyi (Castelnau) and P. yepezi Castex & Castello from six different countries, representing the eastern Pacific Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and river basins in South America (Rio Negro, Orinoco, and Maracaibo). The newly collected material provided additional specimens for morphological studies and molecular samples for subsequent phylogenetic analyses that allowed us to address the phylogenetic position of Anindobothrium and provide molecular and morphological evidence to recognize two additional species for the genus. The taxonomic actions that followed our analyses included the proposition of a new family, Anindobothriidae fam. n., to accommodate the genus Anindobothrium in the order Rhinebothriidea Healy, Caira, Jensen, Webster & Littlewood, 2009 and the description of two new species-one from the eastern Pacific Ocean, A. carrioni sp. n., and the other from the Caribbean Sea, A. inexpectatum sp. n. In addition, we also present a redescription of the type species of the genus, A. anacolum (Brooks, 1977) Marques, Brooks & Lasso, 2001, and of A. lisae Marques, Brooks & Lasso, 2001. Finally, we discuss the paleogeographical events mostly linked with the diversification of the genus and the protocols adopted to uncover cryptic diversity in Anindobothrium.",2017,PLoS ONE
A Minimax Framework for Classification with Applications to Images and High Dimensional Data,"This paper introduces a minimax framework for multiclass classification, which is applicable to general data including, in particular, imagery and other types of high-dimensional data. The framework consists of estimating a representation model that minimizes the fitting errors under a class of distortions of interest to an application, and deriving subsequently categorical information based on the estimated model. A variety of commonly used regression models, including lasso, elastic net and ridge regression, can be regarded as special cases that correspond to specific classes of distortions. Optimal decision rules are derived for this classification framework. By using kernel techniques the framework can account for nonlinearity in the input space. To demonstrate the power of the framework we consider a class of signal-dependent distortions and build a new family of classifiers as new special cases. This family of new methods-minimax classification with generalized multiplicative distortions-often outperforms the state-of-the-art classification methods such as the support vector machine in accuracy. Extensive experimental results on images, gene expressions and other types of data verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",2014,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
"with and without a preop Comparisons of clinical outcomes in patients erative tissue diagnosis in the persistent malignant-looking , ground-glass-opacity nodules","To evaluate the clinical usefulness of surgical resection of persistent malignant-looking ground-glass-opacity nodules (GGN) without a preoperative tissue diagnosis. From September 1998 to November 2011, we retrospectively enrolled 288 patients (126men, 162 women; mean age, 59.3 years) with lung adenocarcinoma proven by surgery and which appeared as GGN on chest computed tomography (CT, ground-glassopacity [GGO] proportion >20%). We divided the study subjects into 2 groups: patients with a preoperative tissue diagnosis (PTD group, n=207) and patients without a preoperative tissue diagnosis (No-PTD group, n=81). In patients with GGN having GGOâ‰¥ 90% (n=140), we divided them into 2 groups: PTD group (n=83) and No-PTD group (n=57). The clinical and surgical outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. In 204 patients who underwent lobectomy for stage Ia lung cancer, there was no significantly different recurrence-free survival between the 2 groups (P=0.721). A significantly lower percentage of No-PTD group waited>14 days for surgery (77.8% vs 87.9%, P=0.030) and were hospitalized for >7 days (56.8% vs 89.9%, P<0.001). They showed a shorter mean surgery time (136.9 vs 155.0 minutes, P=0.019). In patients with GGN having GGOâ‰¥90%, the results were the same as those of all of the study subjects. No-PTD group can gain benefits perioperatively, showing no different recurrence-free survival with PTD group in stage Ia lung cancer.

Also, the commentators failed to take into account our data on reaction times (a measure that is arguably less affected by ceiling effects), which help substantiate our conclusions regarding self-face and self-voice recognition. This rejoinder encourages readers to consider the relevance of the ecological validity of Hughes and Nicholsonâ€™s findings.",2010,Consciousness and Cognition
Mixed Membership Sparse Gaussian Conditional Random Fields,"Building statistical models to explain the association between responses (output) and predictors (input) is critical in many real applications. In reality, responses may not be independent. A promising direction is to predict related responses together (e.g. Multi-task LASSO). However, not all responses have the same degree of relatedness. Sparse Gaussian conditional random field (SGCRF) was developed to learn the degree of relatedness automatically from the samples without any prior knowledge. In real cases, features (both predictors and responses) are not arbitrary, but are dominated by a (smaller) set of related latent factors, e.g. clusters. SGCRF does not capture these latent relations in the model. Being able to model these relations could result in more accurate association between responses and predictors. In this paper, we propose a novel (mixed membership) hierarchical Bayesian model, namely M\(^2\)GCRF, to capture this phenomenon (in terms of clusters). We develop a variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to infer the latent relations and association matrices. We show that M\(^2\)GCRF clearly outperforms existing methods for both synthetic and real datasets, and the association matrices identified by M\(^2\)GCRF are more accurate.",2017,
Feature Learning and Classification in Neuroimaging: Predicting Cognitive Impairment from Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Due to the rapid innovation of technology and the desire to find and employ biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease, high-dimensional data classification problems are routinely encountered in neuroimaging studies. To avoid over-fitting and to explore relationships between disease and potential biomarkers, feature learning and selection plays an important role in classifier construction and is an important area in machine learning. In this article, we review several important feature learning and selection techniques including lasso-based methods, PCA, the two-sample t-test, and stacked auto-encoders. We compare these approaches using a numerical study involving the prediction of Alzheimer's disease from Magnetic Resonance Imaging.",2018,2018 4th International Conference on Big Data and Information Analytics (BigDIA)

SNP Selection in Genome-Wide and Candidate Gene Studies via Penalized Logistic Regression,"Penalized regression methods offer an attractive alternative to single marker testing in genetic association analysis. Penalized regression methods shrink down to zero the coefficient of markers that have little apparent effect on the trait of interest, resulting in a parsimonious subset of what we hope are true pertinent predictors. Here we explore the performance of penalization in selecting SNPs as predictors in genetic association studies. The strength of the penalty can be chosen either to select a good predictive model (via methods such as computationally expensive cross validation), through maximum likelihood-based model selection criterion (such as the BIC), or to select a model that controls for type I error, as done here. We have investigated the performance of several penalized logistic regression approaches, simulating data under a variety of disease locus effect size and linkage disequilibrium patterns. We compared several penalties, including the elastic net, ridge, Lasso, MCP and the normal-exponential-Î³ shrinkage prior implemented in the hyperlasso software, to standard single locus analysis and simple forward stepwise regression. We examined how markers enter the model as penalties and P-value thresholds are varied, and report the sensitivity and specificity of each of the methods. Results show that penalized methods outperform single marker analysis, with the main difference being that penalized methods allow the simultaneous inclusion of a number of markers, and generally do not allow correlated variables to enter the model, producing a sparse model in which most of the identified explanatory markers are accounted for.",2010,Genetic Epidemiology
Volatility connectedness in the cryptocurrency market: Is Bitcoin a dominant cryptocurrency?,"Using the spillover index approach and its variants, we examine both static and dynamic volatility connectedness among eight typical cryptocurrencies. The results reveal that their connectedness fluctuates cyclically and has shown an obvious rise trend since the end of 2016. In the variance decomposition framework, we further construct a volatility connectedness network linking 52 cryptocurrencies using the LASSO-VAR for estimating high-dimensional VARs. We find that these 52 cryptocurrencies are tightly interconnected and â€œmega-capâ€ cryptocurrencies are more likely to propagate volatility shocks to others. However, some unnoticeable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Maidsafe Coin) are also significant net-transmitters of volatility connectedness and even have larger contribution of volatility spillovers to others.",2018,International Review of Financial Analysis
LASSO: Location Assistant for Seeking and Searching Objects,"Applying computer vision systems in robotic manufacturing to locate objects in various positions is an important approach in future manufacturing automation, e.g., product assembly tasks [1] and kitting tasksâ€”grouping several parts to a container. However, the robotâ€™s work environment is often large and cluttered with many objects, and this poses several challenges to computer vision systems. First, the accuracy of computer vision algorithms may be affected by cluttered backgrounds. Second, it is difficult to identify the target object when multiple objects are identical to the target. Third, using a single camera is not enough to cover all areas. To address the above challenges, we propose a programming system called LASSO (Location Assistant for Seeking and Searching Objects), which incorporates user hints to enhance multi-camera visual perception systems of robots in unstructured and cluttered environments. LASSO provides simple language for users to provide relative spatial relations as hints to narrow down the target object in its 3D space. LASSO then leverages this reduced search space to locate the target object in each camera view and compute the 3D location of the target object. A key feature of the LASSO system is that it quantifies the uncertainties of the 3D location, which provides users the quality of LASSO outputs. We demonstrate LASSO in both simulated and real world environments.",2019,2019 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Cyber Physical Systems (ICPS)
Regression and sparse regression methods for viscosity estimation of acid milk from it's SLS features,"Statistical solutions find wide spread use in food and medicine quality control. We investigate the effect of different regression and sparse regression methods for a viscosity estimation problem using the spectro-temporal features from new Sub-Surface Laser Scattering (SLS) vision system. From this investigation, we propose the optimal solution for regression estimation in case of noisy and inconsistent optical measurements, which is the case in many practical measurement systems. The principal component regression (PLS), partial least squares (PCR) and least angle regression (LAR) methods are compared with sparse LAR, lasso and Elastic Net (EN) sparse regression methods. Due to the inconsistent measurement condition, Locally Weighted Scatter plot Smoothing (Loess) has been employed to alleviate the undesired variation in the estimated viscosity. The experimental results of applying different methods show that, the sparse regression lasso outperforms other methods. In addition, the use of local smoothing has improved the results considerably for all regression methods. Due to the sparsity of lasso, this result would assist to design a simpler vision system with less spectral bands.",2012,"2012 19th International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing (IWSSIP)"
EM-based sparse channel estimation in OFDM systems with â„“q-norm regularization in the presence of phase noise and frequency offset,"In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating sparse communication channels in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems with phase noise and carrier frequency offset. We consider the utilization of the â„“q-norm of the channel as a sparsity-promoting regularization term. The corresponding regularized likelihood cost function is expressed in a Bayesian fashion as a Maximum a Posteriori problem, from which the regularization term is expressed as an a priori distribution for the channel. Given the presence of hidden variables (i.e. the phase noise), the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is utilized. We show that the E-step in the proposed algorithm has a closed-form solution for the channel impulse response. In addition, this approach is an extension of previous work of the authors, which covers the popular Lasso.",2015,2015 7th IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)

Assuming that observed data are realizations of a random vector, these data are standardized online in particular to avoid a numerical explosion or when a shrinkage method such as LASSO is used.

The best results are obtained by processes with online standardized data, with averaging and piecewise constant step-sizes. This can be used to update online an event rate score in heart failure patients.",2019,

Parasite-Derived Proteins Inhibit Allergic Specific Th 2 Response,"The prevalence of allergic disease and asthma has increased dramatically during the last 30-40 years. Atopic disorders comprise a range of allergic diseases including asthma, anaphylaxis, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis; these diseases have been seen a precipitous increase in the last four decades. Intriguingly, geographic regions with a high helminth infection burden tend to have a lower incidence of asthma (1). The effects of parasitic infections on the incidence of allergic disease has been receiving increased attention from researchers of late, with studies conducted in Ethiopia and Gabon demonstrating that parasitic infestation is associated with reduced atopic sensitization and dust mite skin test sensitivity (2-4). Children treated repeatedly for Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris lumbricoides exhibited increased dust-mite skin responses as compared with children that had not been treated for asymptomatic soilassociated helminthic infections (5). Several molecules from helminthes induce pronounced Th2 responses in a manner similar to that seen in cases of full-blown parasitic infection. Excretory-secretory (ES) glycoproteins isolated from the rodent nematode, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, have been shown to evidence Th2-promoting activity on dendrite cells, however, the exact nature of the molecules involved in N. brasiliensis ES proteins remain to be clearly elucidated. This activity is heat-labile and protease-sensitive, thereby suggesting that the active component is proteinaceous in nature (6). Also, in schistosomiasis, the soluble extract of Schistosoma mansoni eggs (SEA) was shown to induce SEA-specific Th2 responses when injected into mice (7), and SEA was also demonstrated to condition human dendrite cells (DCs) to polarize Th response in a Th2 direction in vitro (8). When exposed to Th2 cytokines, these molecules can also activate host CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells (regulatory T cells, Treg) which subsequently release IL-10 and tumor growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²), which may be functionally involved in the suppression of the level of Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. These parasites can establish a chronic infection, which highlights important issues (9), in that the presence of these metabolically active pathogens indicates that the immune system is being relentlessly challenged with foreign antigens; this continuous immune reactivity, if uncontrolled, could eventuate severe pathology. In addition, these pathogens may have developed evolutionary strategies by which they may evade the immune system for long-term survival in an immunocompetent host (10). In order to ascertain, then, whether parasitic infections can reduce allergic reactions and whether their infective stage influences the immune system of the host, we have mimicked",2012,

"Analysis of long non-coding RNAs in glioblastoma for prognosis prediction using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, Cox regression, and L1-LASSO penalization","Purpose
This study focused on identification of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) for prognosis prediction of glioblastoma (GBM) through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and L1-penalized least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox proportional hazards (PH) model.


Materials and methods
WGCNA was performed based on RNA expression profiles of GBM from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and the European Bioinformatics Institute ArrayExpress for the identification of GBM-related modules. Subsequently, prognostic lncRNAs were determined using LASSO Cox PH model, followed by constructing a risk scoring model based on these lncRNAs. The risk score was used to divide patients into high- and low-risk groups. Difference in survival between groups was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. IncRNA-mRNA networks were built for the prognostic lncRNAs, followed by pathway enrichment analysis for these networks.


Results
This study identified eight preserved GBM-related modules, including 188 lncRNAs. Consequently, C20orf166-AS1, LINC00645, LBX2-AS1, LINC00565, LINC00641, and PRRT3-AS1 were identified by LASSO Cox PH model. A risk scoring model based on the lncRNAs was constructed that could divide patients into different risk groups with significantly different survival rates. Prognostic value of this six-lncRNA signature was validated in two independent sets. C20orf166-AS1 was associated with antigen processing and presentation and cell adhesion molecule pathways, involving nine common genes. LBX2-AS1, LINC00641, PRRT3-AS1, and LINC00565 were related to focal adhesion, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, which shared 12 common genes.


Conclusion
This prognostic six-lncRNA signature may improve prognosis prediction of GBM. This study reveals many pathways and genes involved in the mechanisms behind these lncRNAs.",2019,OncoTargets and therapy
"Vegetation dynamics, angiosperm radiation and climatic changes in the Lusitanian Basin (Portugal) during Albian times","Abstract The mid-Cretaceous is characterised by significant evolutionary changes in terrestrial ecosystems. During this period, the typical vegetation consisting of ferns, conifers and other gymnosperms was replaced by an angiosperm-dominated flora. Long ranging and continuous records from the continental realm are mostly lacking due to the prevalence of sedimentary gaps. Here a comprehensive palynological and clay mineralogical dataset covering early Albian to early Cenomanian strata from the shallow marine Sao Juliao section (Lusitanian Basin, Portugal) is analysed to reconstruct the vegetation composition as well as climate and weathering conditions in the continental realm. The palynological assemblage is dominated by non-saccate Classopollis and Inaperturopollenites gymnosperm pollen with low abundances of spores and angiosperm pollen. The clay mineralogical data is mainly composed of kaolinite and mica and shows two conspicuous intervals of high kaolinite abundances in the late Albian. Based on the ecological preferences of the associated parent plants of the spore-pollen assemblage, a gradual relative temperature increase is inferred in the hinterland of the Lusitanian Basin during the early Albian to early Cenomanian interval. The clay mineralogy and palynological record show that the climate in the continental hinterland of the Lusitanian Basin was semi-arid to sub-humid and punctuated by two distinct humid phases during the late Albian. Multivariate statistical analyses and a comparison with the nearby Guincho section demonstrate the significance and reproducibility of the spore-pollen record. Furthermore, the palynological assemblage implies that angiosperms and ferns occupied similar palaeo-ecological habitats, namely as understorey in Cheirolepidaceae, Araucariaceae and Cupressaceae conifer-dominated forests.",2017,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"
A Prediction Divergence Criterion for Model Selection,"In this paper, we propose a new criterion for selection between nested models. We suppose that the correct model is one (or near one) of the available models and construct a criterion which is based on the Bregman divergence between the out-of-sample prediction of the smaller model and the in-sample prediction of the larger model. This criterion, the prediction divergence criterion (PDC), is different from the ones that are often used like the AIC, BIC, Cp, in that, in a sequential approach, it directly considers the prediction divergence between two models, rather that differences between the former criteria evaluated at two different models. We derive an estimator for the PDC (PDCE) using Efron (2004) approach on parametric covariance penalty method, and for the linear model and smoothing splines, we show that the PDCE on a suitable sequence of nested models that we formalize, selects the correct model with probability 1 as the sample size tends to infinity. In finite samples, we compare the performance of our criterion to the other ones as well as to the lasso, as find that it outperforms the other criteria in terms of prediction error in sparse situations.",2012,arXiv: Methodology

We apply a mean-shift model to incorporate the coefficients associated with the potential outliers by expressing them as different intercept terms. The sparsity assumption is imposed on both X-covariates and the outlier indicator variables. With suitable penalty factors between X-covaraites and the outlier indicators, we show that the proposed method selects a model of the correct order of dimensionality, under the sparse Riesz condition on the correlation of design variables and a joint sparse Reisz condition on the augmented design matrix. We also show that the estimation/prediction of the selected model can be controlled at a level determined by the sizes of the true model, the outliers and the thresholding level. Moreover, the estimation has a positive breakdown point when both the dimension p and the sample size n tend to infinity, and p >> n. We also provide a generalized version for the estimator by adjusting the penalty weight factor. Finally, we apply the proposed method to analyze an aircraft landing performance data set, for identifying the precursors for undesirable landing performance and reducing the risk of runway overruns.",2012,
Interpretable vector autoregressions with exogenous time series,"The Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) model is fundamental to the study of multivariate time series. Although VAR models are intensively investigated by many researchers, practitioners often show more interest in analyzing VARX models that incorporate the impact of unmodeled exogenous variables (X) into the VAR. However, since the parameter space grows quadratically with the number of time series, estimation quickly becomes challenging. While several proposals have been made to sparsely estimate large VAR models, the estimation of large VARX models is under-explored. Moreover, typically these sparse proposals involve a lasso-type penalty and do not incorporate lag selection into the estimation procedure. As a consequence, the resulting models may be difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose a lag-based hierarchically sparse estimator, called ""HVARX"", for large VARX models. We illustrate the usefulness of HVARX on a cross-category management marketing application. Our results show how it provides a highly interpretable model, and improves out-of-sample forecast accuracy compared to a lasso-type approach.",2017,arXiv: Machine Learning
Regularized brain reading with shrinkage and smoothing,"Functional neuroimaging measures how the brain responds to complex stimuli. However, sample sizes are modest, noise is substantial, and stimuli are high dimensional. Hence, direct estimates are inherently imprecise and call for regularization. We compare a suite of approaches which regularize via shrinkage: ridge regression, the elastic net (a generalization of ridge regression and the lasso), and a hierarchical Bayesian model based on small area estimation (SAE). We contrast regularization with spatial smoothing and combinations of smoothing and shrinkage. All methods are tested on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from multiple subjects participating in two different experiments related to reading, for both predicting neural response to stimuli and decoding stimuli from responses. Interestingly, when the regularization parameters are chosen by cross-validation independently for every voxel, low/high regularization is chosen in voxels where the classification accuracy is high/low, indicating that the regularization intensity is a good tool for identification of relevant voxels for the cognitive task. Surprisingly, all the regularization methods work about equally well, suggesting that beating basic smoothing and shrinkage will take not only clever methods, but also careful modeling.",2015,The Annals of Applied Statistics

The impact of the Romans on the environment of northern England: pollen data from three sites close to Hadrian's Wall,"Pollen diagrams from three sites along Hadrian's Wall in northern England are used to assess human impact on vegetation during the later Holocene, but with particular reference to the Roman period. In the light of available archaeological evidence, the radiocarbon-dated diagrams indicate that at Walton Moss and Glasson Moss, Cumbria, a period of woodland removal began during the Iron Age, continuing and accelerating during the Roman occupation. At Fozy Moss there was little human impact on vegetation in the area around the moss until the time of the Roman occupation when massive clearance resulted in an almost completely deforested landscape. These results are discussed against the background of previously published pollen diagrams from northern Britain.",1994,The Holocene
On the application of machine learning techniques to derive seismic fragility curves,"Abstract Deriving the fragility curves is a key step in seismic risk assessment within the performance-based earthquake engineering framework. The objective of this study is to implement machine learning tools (i.e., classification-based tools in particular) for predicting the structural responses and the fragility curves. In this regard, ten different classification-based methods are explored: logistic regression, lasso regression, support vector machine, Naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, linear and quadratic discriminant analyses, neural networks, and K-nearest neighbors with the structural responses resulted from the multiple strip analyses. In addition, this study examines the impact of class imbalance in training dataset, which is typical among data of structural responses, when developing classification-based models for predicting structural responses. The statistical results using the implemented dataset demonstrate that among applied methods, random forest and quadratic discriminant analysis are, respectively, preferable with the imbalanced and balanced datasets since they show the highest efficiency in predicting the structural responses. Moreover, a detailed procedure is presented on how to derive the fragility curves based on the classification-based tools. Finally, the sensitivity of the applied machine learning methods to the size of employed dataset is investigated. The results explain that logistic regression, lasso regression, and Naive Bayes are not sensitive to the size of dataset (i.e., the number of performed time history analyses); while the performance of discriminant analysis significantly depends on the size of applied dataset.",2019,Computers & Structures
Characterization and overexpression of a novel Î²-agarase from Thalassomonas agarivorans.,"AIMS
The agarase from Thalassomonas agarivorans BCRC 17492 was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The characterization of the novel agarase was performed.


METHODS AND RESULTS
The genomic library of T.Â agarivorans BCRC 17492 was constructed for screening agarase gene. The novel Î²-agarase, namely AgaB1, was successfully identified and shared only 57% identity to reported agarase from Alteromonas sp. To characterize the AgaB1 protein, the recombinant AgaB1 can be obtained by heterologous expression in E.Â coli. The agarase activity of AgaB1 was achieved at 30Â·25Â U per mg at 35Â°C. According to the analysis of optimal conditions, the highest activity of AgaB1 was attained at 40Â°C, pH 7Â·4 and 200Â mmolÂ l(-1) NaCl, and half-life of AgaB1 can be maintained for almost 1Â h at 40Â°C. Further determination of substrate hydrolysis indicated that AgaB1 had possession of both endo- and exolytic activity, and neoagarobiose was the major hydrolysis product by TLC and high-performance liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer (HPLC/MS) analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
We have successfully cloned and overexpressed the novel Î²-agarase from T.Â agarivorans BCRC 17492 in E.Â coli. The high yield and detailed characterization of recombinant AgaB1 was provided.


SIGNIFICANT AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY
AgaB1 was the first Î²-agarase that was cloned and described from Thalassomonas species. In the light of properties of AgaB1, it has the potential as the biocatalyst for industrial applications.",2014,Journal of applied microbiology

Peut-on attraper les utilisateurs de VÃ©lo'v au Lasso ?,"A statistical analysis of the trips made using Veloâ€™v, the community shared bicycle system in Lyon city, is conducted in attempt to relate, through a statistical regression model, social, demographic and economical data of the various neighborhoods of the city with the actual trips made from and to the different parts of the city. For that, parcimonious linear regression methods with positivity constraints are studied. As the lasso solution is found to be not fully adequate for the present problem when interpretation is attempted, a further specificy of he data is introduced: real data on demand are truncated because of a constraint of capacity in bikes at the stands. The LARS algorithm is adapted to this situation of truncated observations. A study of the proposed new algorithm is conducted and it is found to perform well in controlled simulations, estimating well the linear model used to generate truncated observations. 1 Systeme Veloâ€™v : comment analyser lâ€™usage quâ€™en fait par la population ? Nous etudions le service Veloâ€™v de mise a disposition de velos en tant que transport public. Ce systeme automatise de location de velos est en service a Lyon depuis 2005. Sa dynamique de fonctionnement sâ€™apparente par de multiples aspects a celle dâ€™un systeme complexe, câ€™est-a-dire quâ€™au-dessus de comportements individuels simples, on obtient un comportement collectif complexe. Dans des premiers travaux [1, 2], nous avons formule des analyses globales de la dynamique temporelle du service et de la repartition spatiale des trajets. Le present travail est dâ€™etudier des methodes statistiques pour relier les donnees socioeconomiques de la ville (venant de lâ€™INSEE) avec lâ€™usage quâ€™il est fait des Veloâ€™V, quartier par quartier et dependant du moment de la journee. Pre-traitement et formalisation. Le probleme est restreint dans ce travail a la recherche dâ€™un modele suppose lineaire (a defaut dâ€™autres a priori) entre les flux de Veloâ€™v aux stations et les caracteristiques demographiques et socio-economiques du quartier entourant chaque station. Le premier point est de reconcilier les niveaux de description differents entre les donnees : les flux de Veloâ€™v sont connus a chaque station, tandis que les variables demographiques et socio-economique sont connues a lâ€™echelle des ilots (morceau de quartier) ou des IRIS (Ilots Regroupes pour lâ€™Inference Statistique, decoupes par lâ€™INSEE) a lâ€™echelle au-dessus. Les stations sont souvent sur ou pres des axes majeurs de circulations qui decoupent aussi la ville en IRIS : associer les stations a lâ€™IRIS le plus proche nâ€™est clairement pas une solution acceptable. Inspires alors par lâ€™utilisation des modes raster en geographie, il est logique de lisser les flux de Veloâ€™v et de les reaffecter aux IRIS par un noyau de lissage, tout en conservant le nombre total de trajets effectues. Pour faire cela, notons #v(k, t) un flux de Veloâ€™v a la station k âˆˆ S entre le temps t et t+âˆ† (avec typiquementâˆ† = 1h en accord avec [1]).

De-biasing Covariance-Regularized Discriminant Analysis,"Fisherâ€™s Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLD) is a well-known technique for linear classification, feature extraction and dimension reduction. The empirical FLD relies on two key estimations from the data â€“ the mean vector for each class and the (inverse) covariance matrix. To improve the accuracy of FLD under the High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) settings, Covariance-Regularized FLD (CRLD) has been proposed to use shrunken covariance estimators, such as Graphical Lasso, to strike a balance between biases and variances. Though CRLD could obtain better classification accuracy, it usually incurs bias and converges to the optimal result with a slower asymptotic rate. Inspired by the recent progress in de-biased Lasso, we propose a novel FLD classifier, DBLD, which improves classification accuracy of CRLD through de-biasing. Theoretical analysis shows that DBLD possesses better asymptotic properties than CRLD. We conduct experiments on both synthetic datasets and real application datasets to confirm the correctness of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superiority of DBLD over classical FLD, CRLD and other downstream competitors under HDLSS settings.",2018,

Unbiased Group-Sparsity Sensing Using Quadratic Envelopes,This paper investigates a new regularization of the group-sparsity estimation problem based on a quadratic envelope operator. The resulting estimator is shown to have a reduced bias when compared to the classical LASSO estimator and is characterized by a simple hyperparameter selection. Numerical results show that the quadratic envelope regularization yields estimates equal to an oracle solution with high probability. The robustness of the proposed hyperparameter selection rule is also analyzed.,2019,2019 IEEE 8th International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)
Social Sparsity! Neighborhood Systems Enrich Structured Shrinkage Operators,"Sparse and structured signal expansions on dictionaries can be obtained through explicit modeling in the coefficient domain. The originality of the present article lies in the construction and the study of generalized shrinkage operators, whose goal is to identify structured significance maps and give rise to structured thresholding. These generalize Group-Lasso and the previously introduced Elitist Lasso by introducing more flexibility in the coefficient domain modeling, and lead to the notion of social sparsity. The proposed operators are studied theoretically and embedded in iterative thresholding algorithms. Moreover, a link between these operators and a convex functional is established. Numerical studies on both simulated and real signals confirm the benefits of such an approach.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Stardust to Planetesimals: A Chondrule Connection?,"Abstract. The unique nature of chondrnles has been known for nearlytwo centuries. Modern techniques of analysis have shown that these mil-limeter sized silicate objects are among the oldest objects in our solarsystem. Researchers have devised textural and chemical classificationsystems for chondrules in an effort to determine their origins. It is agreedthat most chondrules were molten at some point in their history, and ex-perimental analogs suggest that the majority of chondrules formed fromtemperatures _<1600 Â°C at cooling rates in the range of 100s of degreesper hour.Although interstellar grains are present in chondrite matrices, theircontribution as precursors to chondrule formation is unknown. Models forchondrule formation focus on the pre-planetary solar nebula conditions,although planetary impact models have had proponents.1. IntroductionChondrules were first recognized by de Bournon as ""curious globules"" and re-ported by Howard (1802) as ""small spherical bodies of various sizes"" in theBenares chondrite that was seen ""to fall from the sky"". Howard, together withâ€¢ de Bournon, described the four main components of chondrites: (1) [chondrules]""in great abundance"", (2) ""pyrites"" (troilite), (3)_particles of iron"" and (4)""the three are united together by means of a cement..."" (matrix). In addition,Howard, with help from de Bournon, performed the first chemical analysis ofchondrules: 100 grains were decomposed [by acids] into 50 parts silica, 15 partsmagnesia, 34 parts iron, and 2.5 parts nickel, the excess of 1.5% he correctlyattributed to the oxidation of iron during decomposition. He compared theBenares stones with three other observed chondrite falls, Wold Cottege (GreatBritain), Siena (Italy), and Tabor (Bohemia), and concluded that they were allassociated with ""meteors"" as ""stones falling from the atmosphere were repug-nant to the mind"" and none were connected to volcanic eruptions. Howard'spresentation, which included sections by de Bournon, to the Royal Society ofLondon, is one of the most outstanding revelations pertaining to chondrules andmeteorites that has ever been made, considering the climate of superstition, biasand the unscientific views of that time.

New variable selection strategy for analysis of high-dimensional DNA methylation data,"In genetic association studies, regularization methods are often used due to their computational efficiency for analysis of high-dimensional genomic data. DNA methylation data generated from Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Kit have a group structure where an individual gene consists of multiple Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites. Consequently, group-based regularization can precisely detect outcome-related CpG sites. Representative examples are sparse group lasso (SGL) and network-based regularization. The former is powerful when most of the CpG sites within the same gene are associated with a phenotype outcome. In contrast, the latter is preferred when only a few of the CpG sites within the same gene are related to the outcome. In this paper, we propose new variable selection strategy based on a selection probability that measures selection frequency of individual variables selected by both SGL and network-based regularization. In extensive simulation study, we demonstrated that the proposed strategy can show relatively outstanding selection performance under any situation, compared with both SGL and network-based regularization. Also, we applied the proposed strategy to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and their corresponding genes from ovarian cancer data.",2018,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology
The role of protein-protein interactions in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides.,"Covering: up to 02/2019This review covers the role of protein-protein complexes in the biosynthesis of selected ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) classes. The genomic organization of RiPP systems usually allows the expression of each biosynthetic enzyme as an individual unit, which is in stark contrast to the giant assembly lines found in non-ribosomal peptide and polyketide synthesis systems. Evidence is mounting however that the formation of multi-enzyme complexes is critical for efficient RiPPs biosynthesis and that these complexes may be involved in substrate channeling or conformational sampling. In some pathways, polyfunctional enzymes have evolved, which can be viewed as perpetual protein complexes. We summarize what is currently known on enzyme complexes in RiPP systems for lasso peptides, cyanobactins, linear azolic peptides, thiopeptides, and lanthipeptides.",2019,Natural product reports
Meningococcal disease: A comparison of eight severity scores in 125 children,"ObjectiveTo investigate the accuracy of eight different prognostic scores (Stiehm, Niklasson, Leclerc, Garlund, the MOC score, Tesero, the Glasgow Meningococcal Septicaemia Prognostic Score (GMSPS) and TÃ¼yzÃ¼s) in the prediction of fatal outcome in meningococcal disease.DesignCombined prospective and retrospective study.SettingA 175-bed pediatric department of a university hospital providing secondary care to Â±180,000 inhabitants and serving as a referral center. The Pediatric Intensive Care (14 beds) is one of the six PICUs in the Netherlands and provides tertiary care for children under 18 years.PatientsDuring an 8-year period (1986â€“1994) 125 children (mean age 4 years, 10 months) with culture-proven meningococcal disease were studied: 34 patients presenting with meningitis, 33 patients with septic shock and 58 patients with meningitis and septic shock.Main resultsAll eight scores discriminated above average between survivors and non-survivors, as expressed by the corresponding Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) ranged from 0.74 for the Garlund score to 0.93 for the GMSPS. The GMSPS performed significantly better than its competitors, even after exclusion of the base deficit as one of the score components (AUC=0.92). It showed above average calibration when logistically transformed into a probability of mortality, and accurately identified a subgroup of patients with no mortality. None of the scores correctly identified non-survivors.ConclusionThe GMSPS is a simple score that can be reliably used for risk classification and the identification of low-risk patients.",2005,Intensive Care Medicine
ADMM-based audio reconstruction for low-cost-sound-monitoring,"For low-cost sound monitoring of machineries, we propose a novel audio reconstruction method superior in terms of accuracy and processing time. A conventional method based on the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) has been proposed for audio recovery. However, the conventional method has a low performance for sounds of machineries because, sounds of machineries tend to be not highly sparse, and the reconstruction performance of OMP decreases extremely if the signal is not sufficiently sparse. To solve the problem of the conventional method, the proposed method is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for Group Lasso combined with the Gabor dictionary. While OMP's performance decreases with the number of nonzero elements, the proposed method shows a better robustness to variations in sparsity and outputs a reasonable result in a few tens of iterations. Those features among others make the algorithm a reliable solution which offers a better trade-off between accuracy and processing time compared to the conventional method.",2017,2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
"Middle Jurassic vegetation dynamics from allochthonous palynological assemblages: an example from a marginal marine depositional setting; Lajas Formation, NeuquÃ©n Basin, Argentina","Abstract Middle Jurassic marginal marine sediments from four successions within the Lajas Formation, Neuquen Basin, Argentina, were analysed to establish their palynofloral composition. The palynofloras, mostly of terrestrial origin, are characterised by a dominance of Classopollis spp. and common Pityosporites spp.; Deltoidospora spp.; Araucariaceae and inaperturate pollen. Correspondence analysis performed on the palynomorph assemblages derived ecological groupings characteristic of a number of palaeoenvironments from coastal/deltaic, river margins and floodplains, to higher altitude arid forests. The ecological groupings differ between the four studied successions indicating a dynamic ecosystem. Delta top depositional settings have ecological groupings characteristic of mid-late seral communities, whereas delta front and bayfill depositional settings have ecological groupings displaying early-mid seral communities. This study discusses the taphonomic and palaeoecological reasons for these changes in palaeoecological grouping. The relationships between natural ecological groupings of taxa determined using correspondence analysis provide evidence for the first order drivers of vegetation dynamics. Water availability and environmental stress (substrate disturbance) are proposed as the most important drivers of palaeofloral seral succession during the Middle Jurassic of the Neuquen Basin. This relationship between floral communities and their palaeoenvironment can be related to the ecological parameters of modern floras suggesting that similar ecological drivers control palaeofloral assemblages as far back, at least, as the Middle Jurassic. The process used herein provides a thorough methodology of understanding floral palaeoecologies and drivers of seral succession in plant communities from allochthonous materials in marginal marine depositional settings. From this, a greater understanding of the depositional environment can be derived through the appreciation of taphonomic processes.",2013,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"
Adaptive Elastic Echo State Network for Multivariate Time Series Prediction,"Echo state network (ESN) is a new kind of recurrent neural network with a randomly generated reservoir structure and an adaptable linear readout layer. It has been widely employed in the field of time series prediction. However, when high-dimensional reservoirs are utilized to predict multivariate time series, there may be a collinearity problem. In this paper, to overcome the collinearity problem and obtain a sparse solution, we propose a new model-adaptive elastic ESN, in which adaptive elastic net algorithm is used to calculate the unknown weights. It combines the strengths of the quadratic regularization and the adaptively weighted lasso shrinkage. Hence, the proposed model can deal with the collinearity problem and enjoy the oracle property with an unbiased estimation. We exhibit the merits of our model on two benchmark multivariate chaotic datasets and two real-world applications. Experimental results substantiate the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed model.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics
Sparse conformal predictors,"Conformal predictors, introduced by Vovk et al. (Algorithmic Learning in a Random World, Springer, New York, 2005), serve to build prediction intervals by exploiting a notion of conformity of the new data point with previously observed data. We propose a novel method for constructing prediction intervals for the response variable in multivariate linear models. The main emphasis is on sparse linear models, where only few of the covariates have significant influence on the response variable even if the total number of covariates is very large. Our approach is based on combining the principle of conformal prediction with the â„“1 penalized least squares estimator (LASSO). The resulting confidence set depends on a parameter Îµ>0 and has a coverage probability larger than or equal to 1âˆ’Îµ. The numerical experiments reported in the paper show that the length of the confidence set is small. Furthermore, as a by-product of the proposed approach, we provide a data-driven procedure for choosing the LASSO penalty. The selection power of the method is illustrated on simulated and real data.",2010,Statistics and Computing

Out of 244 patients in second-line therapy, 79 met our inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was 42Â±10.2 years. Women (35.8 years) were younger than men (43.8 years) (p=0.001). Most were married (48.1%), 23.5% of whom were polygamous. The majority of patients (38/79) in the study had a CD4 count of <200 cells/ mm3. The median duration of ARV therapy since the beginning of the therapeutic history has been 4.8 (2.5-11 years). CVp greater than 10,000 copies/ml at the start of second-line therapy (p=0.003) and TDF+FTC + DRV + RTV combination (p=0.001) were associated with persistent low viremia. A genotypic resistance test is needed for these patients in order to better adapt the ARV treatment.",2018,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique
Conservation and diversity in expression of candidate genes regulating socially-induced female-male sex change in wrasses,"Fishes exhibit remarkably diverse, and plastic, patterns of sexual development, most striking of which is sequential hermaphroditism, where individuals readily reverse sex in adulthood. How this stunning example of phenotypic plasticity is controlled at a genetic level remains poorly understood. Several genes have been implicated in regulating sex change, yet the degree to which a conserved genetic machinery orchestrates this process has not yet been addressed. Using captive and in-the-field social manipulations to initiate sex change, combined with a comparative qPCR approach, we compared expression patterns of four candidate regulatory genes among three species of wrasses (Labridae)-a large and diverse teleost family where female-to-male sex change is pervasive, socially-cued, and likely ancestral. Expression in brain and gonadal tissues were compared among the iconic tropical bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) and the temperate spotty (Notolabrus celidotus) and kyusen (Parajulus poecilepterus) wrasses. In all three species, gonadal sex change was preceded by downregulation of cyp19a1a (encoding gonadal aromatase that converts androgens to oestrogens) and accompanied by upregulation of amh (encoding anti-mÃ¼llerian hormone that primarily regulates male germ cell development), and these genes may act concurrently to orchestrate ovary-testis transformation. In the brain, our data argue against a role for brain aromatase (cyp19a1b) in initiating behavioural sex change, as its expression trailed behavioural changes. However, we find that isotocin (it, that regulates teleost socio-sexual behaviours) expression correlated with dominant male-specific behaviours in the bluehead wrasse, suggesting it upregulation mediates the rapid behavioural sex change characteristic of blueheads and other tropical wrasses. However, it expression was not sex-biased in temperate spotty and kyusen wrasses, where sex change is more protracted and social groups may be less tightly-structured. Together, these findings suggest that while key components of the molecular machinery controlling gonadal sex change are phylogenetically conserved among wrasses, neural pathways governing behavioural sex change may be more variable.",2019,PeerJ
Development and validation of a prognostic model for overall survival in chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) from the phase III PREVAIL clinical trial.,"138Background: Prognostic models require updating to reflect contemporary medical practice. In a post hoc analysis of the phase 3 PREVAIL trial (enzalutamide vs placebo), we identified prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in chemotherapy-naive men with mCRPC. Methods: Patients were randomly divided 2:1 into training (n = 1159) and testing (n = 550) sets. Using the training set, 23 predefined candidate prognostic factors (including treatment) were analyzed in a multivariable Cox model with stepwise procedures and in a penalized Cox proportional hazards model using the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty (data cutoff June 1, 2014). A multivariable model predicting OS was developed using the training set; the predictive accuracy was assessed in the testing set using time-dependent area under the curve (tAUC). The testing set was stratified based on risk score tertiles (low, intermediate, high), and OS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Results: Demograph...",2017,Journal of Clinical Oncology
Non-Invasive Estimation of Hemoglobin Using a Multi-Model Stacking Regressor.,"Objective We describe a novel machine-learning based method to estimate total Hemoglobin (Hb) using photoplethysmograms (PPGs) acquired non-invasively.


METHODS
In a study conducted in Karnataka, India, 1583 women (pregnant and non-pregnant) of childbearing age, with Hb values ranging between 1.6 to 14.8 g/dL, had their Hb values estimated using intravenous blood samples and concurrently by a finger sensor custom designed and prototyped for this study. The finger sensor collected PPG signals at four wavelengths: 590nm, 660nm, 810nm, and 940nm. A novel feature vector was derived from these PPG. A machine learning model comprising of a two-layer stack of regressors including Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Ridge, Elastic Net, Adaptive (Ada) Boost and Support Vector Regressors (SVR) was designed and tested.


RESULTS
We report a statistically significant correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.81 (p<0.01) between the Hb value estimated by the proposed methodology and gold standard values of Hb, with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 1.353 Ã— 0.042 g/dL. The performance of the stacked regressor model was significantly better than the performance of individual regressors (low RMSE error, and better CC; p<0.05). Post-hoc analysis showed that including pregnant women in the training data set significantly improved the performance of the algorithm.


CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates the feasibility of a machine learning based non-invasive hemoglobin measurement system, especially for maternal anemia detection.


SIGNIFICANCE
By developing and demonstrating a machine learning approach on a vast data set, we have demonstrated that such an approach could become the basis for a public health screening tool to detect and treat maternal anemia and could supplement global health intervention strategie.",2019,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics
Fused Lasso and rotation invariant autoregressive models for texture classification,"Anisotropic, rotation invariant, autoregressive random fields, realised by considering local radial sampling, are flexible models which have been considered for texture classification. Unfortunately, owing to the strong correlations present in the neighbourhood covariate matrix, parameter estimation is complicated by the dichotomy between ill-conditionedness and rotation invariance. Exploiting the Fused Lasso framework, we here propose a compromise which incorporates two regularisers. The @?""1-norm induces stability and performs variable selection amongst strongly correlated radial samples; the total variation seminorm encourages clustering and promotes parsimony. Experiments confirm the potential utility. Parallels are drawn within the texture classification literature and beyond.",2013,Pattern Recognit. Lett.
"Thalassobius mediterraneus gen. nov., sp. nov., and reclassification of Ruegeria gelatinovorans as Thalassobius gelatinovorus comb. nov.","A Gram-negative, slightly halophilic, non-pigmented, strictly aerobic, chemo-organotrophic bacterium was isolated from sea water off the western Mediterranean coast near Valencia (Spain). This strain was able to grow on several organic acids and amino acids added to a minimal medium as carbon sources, but used few carbohydrates or yielded slight growth when sugars were used. Phylogenetic analysis based on an almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain XSM19T was a member of the Roseobacter group within the 'Alphaproteobacteria', with its closest phylogenetic neighbour being Ruegeria gelatinovorans (97.6 % sequence similarity). Following a polyphasic approach, it was concluded that strain XSM19T represents a new genus and novel species, for which the name Thalassobius mediterraneus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is XSM19T (=CECT 5383T=CIP 108400T=CCUG 49438T). It is also proposed that R. gelatinovorans (RÃ¼ger & HÃ¶fle 1992) Uchino et al. 1999 is reclassified as Thalassobius gelatinovorus comb. nov.",2005,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
