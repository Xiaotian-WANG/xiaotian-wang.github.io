Classification of Low-grade and High-grade Glioma using Multiparametric Radiomics Model,"Glioma is the most common primary central nervous system malignancy. Accurate grading of glioma before surgery is essential for the patientâ€™s next treatment planning and prognosis. In recent years, radiomics has been increasingly popular in the field of image diagnosis, providing new ideas and techniques for conventional image interpretation modes. By mining the deep morphological and physiological features of tumor tissue inside the image, by using information gain and LASSO to select features, the SVM classifier classifies the high and low levels of glioma according to the selected features, and finally obtains that the information gain mechanism can be better selected to have a significant degree of discrimination. Features and achieves an accuracy of 0.91 and an AUC value of 0.862.",2019,"2019 IEEE 3rd Information Technology, Networking, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (ITNEC)"
Chronic disability in walking: Results of a school survey,"Introduction Walking disorder is a frequent reason for consultation in pediatric rehabilitation. It is most often a lameness that imposes a precise etiologic diagnosis for an appropriate treatment. Objectives Establish the epidemiological and diagnostic profile of chronic disability in school-based walking in Bobo-Dioulasso. Material/patients and methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Bobo-Dioulasso primary schools from January to May 2014. It involved 10 schools from a simple random draw. Sampling was exhaustive. The diagnosis of the cases was based on clinical and paraclinical examination. Only students with a walking disorder who have been living for more than six months have been selected. Results A total of 4336 students were examined. Of these, 62 had a chronic walking disability, giving a prevalence of 14.3â€°. The main causes of chronic walking disability were axial deviations of the lower limbs (37.3%), followed by aseptic necrosis of the femoral head (30.65%) and iatrogenic paralysis of the sciatic nerve (11.3%). No cases of poliomyelitis were found. DiscussionÂ â€“Â conclusion Chronic walking disability occupies a modest place in childhood pathology in Burkina Faso. An epidemiological transition is under way with the disappearance of poliomyelitis sequelae in the infant population.",2017,Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine
Foresight of Macro Environment in Agribusiness: Dynamic Relationships of Food Consumption and Agricultural Production (Analysis of the Relations between Agricultural Production and Domestic Consumption),"The article is devoted to an important economic element agribusinessforesight the analysis of general economic conditions, and specifically the search for links in the production of agricultural products in general and domestic consumption of basic food products. As the main research methods for the current research there were used LASSO Regression method with a regularizer and Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm. The time series from 1991 to 2018, transformed into the form of annual percentage changes, were used as the initial data. At the beginning, a preliminary selection of features was made, and further two corresponding models were formed on the basis of the selected hyperparameters. As an additional target variable, a series of production was created with a time lag of one period in relation to the rest of the series. The degrees of the linear and nonlinear relationships for various types of food are determined, as well as differences in aggregates of crop production and animal husbandry are revealed. General recommendations are given within the framework of the policy for the development of the institutional environment of agribusiness and its foresight systems.",2020,

Adaptive Lasso for Sparse High-dimensional Regression Models,"We study the asymptotic properties of the adaptive Lasso estimators in sparse, high-dimensional, linear regression models when the number of covariates may increase with the sample size. We consider variable selection using the adap- tive Lasso, where the L1 norms in the penalty are re-weighted by data-dependent weights. We show that, if a reasonable initial estimator is available, under ap- propriate conditions, the adaptive Lasso correctly selects covariates with nonzero coefficients with probability converging to one, and that theestimators of nonzero coefficients have the same asymptotic distribution they would have if the zero co- efficients were known in advance. Thus, the adaptive Lasso hasan oracle property in the sense of Fan and Li (2001) and Fan and Peng (2004). In addition, under a partial orthogonality condition in which the covariates with zero coefficients are weakly correlated with the covariates with nonzero coefficients, marginal regression can be used to obtain the initial estimator. With this initial estimator, the adaptive Lasso has the oracle property even when the number of covariates is much larger than the sample size.",2008,
Learning structured densities via infinite dimensional exponential families,"Learning the structure of a probabilistic graphical models is a well studied problem in the machine learning community due to its importance in many applications. Current approaches are mainly focused on learning the structure under restrictive parametric assumptions, which limits the applicability of these methods. In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the structure of a probabilistic graphical model without assuming a particular parametric model. We consider probabilities that are members of an infinite dimensional exponential family [4], which is parametrized by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) H and its kernel k. One difficulty in learning nonparametric densities is the evaluation of the normalizing constant. In order to avoid this issue, our procedure minimizes the penalized score matching objective [10, 11]. We show how to efficiently minimize the proposed objective using existing group lasso solvers. Furthermore, we prove that our procedure recovers the graph structure with high-probability under mild conditions. Simulation studies illustrate ability of our procedure to recover the true graph structure without the knowledge of the data generating process.",2015,
Respecting the Policy of the Journal,"Authors require timely peer review and publication for papers they send forpossible publication. Especially when the manuscript is needed for upgrading purpose,the demand for timely publication rises. Many manuscripts are sent to The EthiopianJournal of Social Sciences and Language Studies (EJSSLS) for quick and possiblepublication. The editors of the journal are working hard to satisfy the demand of theauthors. However, we the editors of the journal, during the last three years, have foundthat many authors do not strictly follow the policy of the journal in general and theâ€œInformation to Contributorsâ€ in particular. Consequently, timely publication hasbecome a challenge. Some areas that presented challenges to the editors are as follows.Language: When we call for paper, we always inform authors that theirmanuscript must be edited for language. However, the language used for composingmost of the manuscripts we have received so far is below the required standardâ€“it doesnot well communicate the subject matter. Even after a manuscript is edited for language,incorporating the given comments in to the manuscript is time demanding for the editors.References: The journal follows a referencing style of American PsychologicalAssociation (APA) for any manuscript from different disciplines submitted to the journal.But authors send their manuscript with different citation and referencing styles. This alsohas presented challenges to the editors to release issues timely.Abstract: Problems related to abstract writing are twofold as far as the editorsâ€™experience is concerned. The â€œInformation to Contributorsâ€, which is given on the innerback page of the journal and posted on the journalâ€™s webpage reads: â€œThis [the abstractâ€should be a single paragraph standing alone (not italic), and not exceeding 250 words.The abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, instruments used to collectdata, methods of analysis, the principal results and major conclusions as well asrecommendation/implicationâ€. The problem is that many authors do not obey the giveninformation. For one thing, they write more than 250 words. For the other thing, they donot include the basic components of an abstract. A few authors may be because of theirbusy schedule ask the editors to write and to shorten the abstract for them. Imagine theburden it adds to the editors.Article Length: According to the policy of the journal, â€œoriginal manuscriptsshould not exceed 15 pages. Book review and Article Review should not exceed 2000and 8,000 words respectively. Editorial preferably consist of no more than 1,000 to1,500 words and usually do not have subheadings. Short communication should notexceed 4 pagesâ€. Yet, many of the manuscripts sent to the journal are beyond therequired length. Shortening the length to the required size takes longer time; hence delayof publication.Submission: The policy of the journal requires authors to sign and submitmanuscript submission form along with the manuscript as an email attachment.However, some authors do not do so. This delays the review process because the editorsdo not initiate the review process without getting guaranty from a corresponding authorthat the manuscript has not been published or has not been considered for possiblepublication somewhere else. After passing through review and editorial process, justbefore their release/publish, a few manuscripts have been found plagiarized. Hence, theeditors of the journal have the right to request corresponding authors to submit signedmanuscript submission form. The â€œInformation to contributorsâ€ reads: â€œSignedmanuscript submission form should accompany the manuscript (it can be copied from thejournalâ€™s Wabe page)â€. Not doing so also delays timely publication.So far we have spent great deal of sacrifices to maintain quality of publicationsand time of issue releases. However, after now, though we do love helping our dearmanuscript contributors, we editors cannot give such services for varies reasons such aslarge number of submitted manuscripts, work burden and family responsibilities. Now,since the journal by default has reached the stage of reputability, the editors would beforced to prioritize manuscripts with very important issues and strictly follow the policyof the journal. Hence, dear respected manuscript contributors, to get your manuscriptspublished timely, please follow strictly the policy of the journal.

Thalassoma amblycephalus ein neuer Anemonenfisch-Typ,"Observations in the Indian Ocean near Shimoni (Kenya) have added the labride Thalassoma amblycephalus (Bleeker) to the list of fishes which regularly visit sea-anemones. If disturbed, the fish seeks protection near the column or under the oral disk of anemones. It normally visits the anemones spontaneously, inspects the tentacles and picks up small food particles caught by the anemones; this behavior characterizes T. amblycephalus as a food parasite. New observations, and the fact that T. amblycephalus is a labride and not a pomacentride like the species of Amphiprion, Dascyllus and Premnas-other fishes known to establish associations with anemones-throw new light on the ecological importance of anemone-fish associations.Zusammenfassung1.Freiwasserbeobachtungen im Indischen Ozean zeigten, daÃŸ auch der Labride Thalassoma amblycephalus (Bleeker), aktiv Anemonen aufsucht; einmal auf Ã¤uÃŸere StÃ¶rungen hin, zum anderen spontan, um von Anemonen Nahrungspartikel abzuweiden, die diese zum Eigenverzehr gefangen haben.2.Durch dieses Verhalten wird Thalassoma amblycephalus zum Nahrungsparasiten.3.Es wird diskutiert, welche neuen Aspekte sich in evolutionistischer, phylogenetischer und populationsdynamischer Sicht fÃ¼r die Beurteilung des Zusammenlebens von Riffanemonen mit anderen Tieren aus der Tatsache ergeben, daÃŸ Thalassoma amblycephalus Anemonen aufsucht, obwohl er mit den bisher bekannten Anemonenfischen nicht verwandt ist.",1970,Marine Biology
New Realism(s) : brief theoretical inquiry,"espanolEntre las diferentes tendencias de la filosofia contemporanea, el llamado ""nuevo realismo"" es probablemente uno de los mas interesantes. El ""Nuevo Realismo"" no es simplemente un ""regreso"" a la realidad, un reconocimiento banal y trivial de la existencia del mundo externo.

Por lo tanto, el Nuevo Realismo es una especie de antagonista filosofico de la posmodernidad. Sin embargo, no podemos reducir el Nuevo Realismo a la simple critica de la posmodernidad.

The â€œNew Realismâ€ is not simply a â€œbackâ€ to the reality, a banal and trivial recognition of the existence of the external world. Rather, it is a polemic (and therefore political) philosophical movement against the theoretical monopoly, especially in continental philosophy, ruled by the postmodern philosophical discourse. Therefore, New Realism is a sort of philosophical antagonist of postmodernity. However, we cannot flatten the New Realism on the critique of postmodernity. Indeed, New Realism is a multifaceted and stratified philosophical movement. There are several different New Realisms.

Yield Forecasting of Spring Maize Using Remote Sensing and Crop Modeling in Faisalabad-Punjab Pakistan,"Real time, accurate and reliable estimation of maize yield is valuable to policy makers in decision making. The current study was planned for yield estimation of spring maize using remote sensing and crop modeling. In crop modeling, the CERES-Maize model was calibrated and evaluated with the field experiment data and after calibration and evaluation, this model was used to forecast maize yield. A Field survey of 64 farm was also conducted in Faisalabad to collect data on initial field conditions and crop management data. These data were used to forecast maize yield using crop model at farmersâ€™ field. While in remote sensing, peak season Landsat 8 images were classified for landcover classification using machine learning algorithm. After classification, time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) of the surveyed 64 farms were calculated. Principle component analysis were run to correlate the indicators with maize yield. The selected LSTs and NDVIs were used to develop yield forecasting equations using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Calibrated and evaluated results of CERES-Maize showed the mean absolute % error (MAPE) of 0.35â€“6.71% for all recorded variables. In remote sensing all machine learning algorithms showed the accuracy greater the 90%, however support vector machine (SVM-radial basis) showed the higher accuracy of 97%, that was used for classification of maize area. The accuracy of area estimated through SVM-radial basis was 91%, when validated with crop reporting service. Yield forecasting results of crop model were precise with RMSE of 255Â kgÂ haâˆ’1, while remote sensing showed the RMSE of 397Â kgÂ haâˆ’1. Overall strength of relationship between estimated and actual grain yields were good with R2 of 0.94 in both techniques. For regional yield forecasting remote sensing could be used due greater advantages of less input dataset and if focus is to assess specific stress, and interaction of plant genetics to soil and environmental conditions than crop model is very useful tool.",2018,Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing
A new approach for multi-omic data integration,"Recent technological advances have enabled the generation of various omic data (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and glycomics) in a high-throughput manner. The integration of multi-omic data sets is desirable to unravel the complexity of a biological system. In this paper, we propose a new approach to investigate both inter and intra relationships for multi-omic data sets by using regularized canonical correlation analysis and graphical lasso. The application of this novel approach on real multi-omic data sets helps identify hub proteins and their neighbors that may be missed by typical statistical analysis to serve as biomarker candidates. Also, the integration of data from various cellular components (i.e., proteins, metabolites and glycans) offers the potential to discover more reliable biomarker candidates for complex disease.",2014,2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)
"Statistical methods for the integration analysis of - omics data (genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics): An application to bladder cancer","An increase amount of ?omics data is being generated and single ?omics analyses have been performed to analyze it in the last decades. While the effort has revealed significant findings to better understand the biology of complex disease, such as cancer, combining more than two ?omics data will certainly explain further biological insights not found otherwise. For this reason, in the last five years the idea of integrating data has appeared in the context of system biology. However, the integration of ?omics data requires of appropriate statistical techniques to address the main challenges that high-throughput data impose. In this thesis, we propose different statistical approaches to integrate ?omics data (genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics from tumor tissue, and genomics from blood samples) in individuals with bladder cancer. In the first contribution, a framework based on a multi-staged strategy was proposed. Pairwise combinations using the three ?omics measured in tumor were analyzed (transcriptomics-epigenomics, eQTL and methQTL) to end with the combination of all of them in triples relationships. The results showed a whole spectrum of relationships and sound biological trans associations identifying new possible molecular targets. In the second contribution, a multi-dimensional analysis was applied to the three ?omics considered together in the same model. Penalized regression methods (LASSO and ENET) were applied since they can combine the data in a large input matrix dealing with many of the ?omics data integration challenges. Besides, a permutation?based MaxT method was proposed to assess the goodness of fit while correcting for multiple testing which are the main drawbacks of the penalized regression methods. We obtained a list of genes associated with genotypes and DNA methylation in cis relationship that were further externally validated in an independent data set. Finally, the same approach was applied to integrate the three ?omics data in tumor with the genomics data in blood samples in an integrative eQTL analysis. This approach was compared with the 2 stage regression (2SR) approach previously used for eQTL integrative analysis. Our approach highlighted relevant eQTLs including the ones found by the 2SR strategy generating a list of genes and eQTLs that may be considered in future analyses. Overall, we have shown that ?omics integrative analysis is needed to find missing or hidden information. To this end, applying appropriate statistical approaches is needed identify sound biological relationships.",2015,
Quantifying Hole Transfer Yield from Perovskite to Polymer Layer: Statistical Correlation of Solar Cell Outputs with Kinetic and Energetic Properties,"Organicâ€“inorganic hybrid perovskites provide not only an exceptionally rich area of research but also remarkable power conversion efficiency relevant to commercial use. However, developing efficient organic hole transport layers remains challenging, due partly to the subtle electronic behavior of perovskite and complications introduced by the use of reactive dopants. Here we show, through time-resolved microwave conductivity, the quantification of a hole transfer process from methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite to eight kinds of conjugated polymers with and without a Li dopant. The time evolution of hole transfer yield is characterized by kinetic parameters, which are further examined in conjunction with solar cell performance, energetics, and temporal profiles triggered by exposure to air at the minute scale. Using statistics and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) analysis, we identify an accurate descriptor that correlates with device output.

An eight-mRNA signature outperforms the lncRNA-based signature in predicting prognosis of patients with glioblastoma,"The prognosis of the glioblastoma (GBM) is dismal. This study aims to select an optimal RNA signature for prognostic prediction of GBM patients. For the training set, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA expression profiles of 151 patients were downloaded from the TCGA. Differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) and lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) were identified between good prognosis and bad prognosis patients. Optimal prognostic mRNAs and lncRNAs were selected respectively, by using univariate Cox proportional-hazards (PH) regression model and LASSO Cox-PH model. Subsequently, four prognostic scoring models were built based on expression levels or expression status of the selected prognostic lncRNAs or mRNAs, separately. Each prognostic model was applied to the training set and an independent validation set. Function analysis was used to uncover the biological roles of these prognostic DEGs between different risk groups classified by the mRNA-based signature. We obtained 261 DEGs and 33 DE-lncRNAs between good prognosis and bad prognosis patients. A panel of eight mRNAs and a combination of ten lncRNAs were determined as predictive RNAs by LASSO Cox-PH model. Among the four prognostic scoring models using the eight-mRNA signature or the ten-lncRNA signature, the one based on the expression levels of the eight mRNAs showed the greatest predictive power. The DEGs between different risk groups using the eight prognostic mRNAs were functionally involved in calcium signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, and Wnt signaling pathway. The eight-mRNA signature has greater prognostic value than the ten-lncRNA-based signature for GBM patients based on bioinformatics analysis.",2020,BMC Medical Genetics
Variable selection and structure identification for varying coefficient Cox models,"We consider varying coefficient Cox models with high-dimensional covariates. We apply the group Lasso to these models and propose a variable selection procedure. Our procedure can cope with simultaneous variable selection and structure identification from a high dimensional varying coefficient model to a semivarying coefficient model. We also derive an oracle inequality and closely examine restrictive eigenvalue conditions. In this paper, we give the details for Cox models with time-varying coefficients. The theoretical results on variable selection can be easily extended to some other important models and we briefly mention those models since those models can be treated in the same way. The models considered in this paper are the most popular models among structured nonparametric regression models. The results of numerical studies are also reported.",2017,J. Multivar. Anal.
A six-CpG-based methylation markers for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in blood.,"DNA methylation markers in the peripheral blood are able to be applied to treat epithelial cancer. Nevertheless, the diagnostic potential value of it for ovarian cancer (OV) has not been studied. The study aimed to explore the difference of DNA methylation in peripheral blood between OV patients and healthy women. Firstly, the whole blood of DNA methylation data was provided by the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The linear model was applied to the identification of significantly differentially expressed methylated CpG sites (differentially methylation sites [DMP]), and the further screen of co-expression CpG sites (Co-DMP). A total of 2812 DMPs were identified, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis helped to obtain seven co-expression modules. Among them, the yellow module was the most related to OV. Co-DMPs (167) in the yellow module were mainly distributed near the transcription start sites. However, most of them were not in the CpG island. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was applied to the identification of stable OV-related blood biomarkers that six Co-DMPs (cg00134539, cg00226923, cg25268718, cg25697314, cg25839227, cg26574610) with the highest frequency were found as potential biomarkers. Finally, the diagnostic classifier was established using the support vector machine (SVM) with the accuracy rate of 87.1% and 74.5% in training data set and validation data set, respectively. To sum up, a new feature was provided here for the diagnosis of OV, which is helpful for the diagnosis and individualized treatments of early OV.",2019,Journal of cellular biochemistry
Qualidade de vida de mulheres com cÃ¢ncer de mama Quality of life in breast cancer survivors,"ABSTRACT Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women. Its diagnosis and treatment have social, economic,physical, emotional/psychological and sexual repercussions. The main parameters used to assess the results of anticancertherapy are disease-free survival and overall survival. More recently, quality of life (QOL) has been considered an additionalparameter. No consensus exists about the definition of QOL. However, most definitions take into account multidimensionaland subjective aspects of QOL. The identification of factors related to QOL and comprehension of how these factorscontribute to the perception of QOL are reasons for debate, since the concept of QOL is directly related to the social andcultural context in which the individual is inserted. Age at diagnosis, chemotherapy, type of surgery, climacteric symptoms,relationship between the couple, and sexuality are several factors associated with QOL in women with breast cancer. QOLassociated with different antineoplastic therapies may help patients and physicians choose the best therapeutic modality.Towards this end, the current article addresses various aspects of QOL of breast cancer women, and presents the state-of-the-art knowledge on the topic.",2006,

Multiple-population shrinkage estimation via sliced inverse regression,"The problem of dimension reduction in multiple regressions is investigated in this paper, in which data are from several populations that share the same variables. Assuming that the set of relevant predictors is the same across the regressions, a joint estimation and selection method is proposed, aiming to preserve the common structure, while allowing for population-specific characteristics. The new approach is based upon the relationship between sliced inverse regression and multiple linear regression, and is achieved through the lasso shrinkage penalty. A fast alternating algorithm is developed to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated through simulated and real data examples.",2017,Statistics and Computing
The Effect of The Using of Computer Games On Academic Success In Teaching English To 8th Grade Students,"In this study,
the effect of using computer games in an English teaching classof the 8th grade
students in secondary school is investigated. A total of 112 8th grade students,
57 in the experimental group and 55 in the control group, participated in the
study. Academic Achievement Tests prepared by Ministry of National Education,
Measurement, Evaluation and Exam Services Department were used as pre-test and
post-test. Eight of the games, which were prepared specifically for Grade 8
students, were used in the Experimental Information Network (EBA). Preliminary
tests as covariant, final tests as dependent variables and applied to groups of
teaching and traditional teaching were discussed as independent variables.
According to the one-way covariance analysis (COVARIANCE) results, it was found
that the game was more effective than traditional teaching and this effect was
moderate. In addition, it was determined that 36% of the final test scores of
the students learning the game were explained by the game.",2019,
Seismic sparse-spike deconvolution via Toeplitz-sparse matrix factorization,"ABSTRACTWe have developed a new sparse-spike deconvolution (SSD) method based on Toeplitz-sparse matrix factorization (TSMF), a bilinear decomposition of a matrix into the product of a Toeplitz matrix and a sparse matrix, to address the problems of lateral continuity, effects of noise, and wavelet estimation error in SSD. Assuming the convolution model, a constant source wavelet, and the sparse reflectivity, a seismic profile can be considered as a matrix that is the product of a Toeplitz wavelet matrix and a sparse reflectivity matrix. Thus, we have developed an algorithm of TSMF to simultaneously deconvolve the seismic matrix into a wavelet matrix and a reflectivity matrix by alternatively solving two inversion subproblems related to the Toeplitz wavelet matrix and sparse reflectivity matrix, respectively. Because the seismic wavelet is usually compact and smooth, the fused Lasso was used to constrain the elements in the Toeplitz wavelet matrix. Moreover, due to the limitations of computer memory, large...",2016,Geophysics
Construction of disease risk scoring systems using logistic group lasso: application to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome survey data,"We propose to utilize the group lasso algorithm for logistic regression to construct a risk scoring system for predicting disease in swine. This work is motivated by the need to develop a risk scoring system from survey data on risk factor for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which is a major health, production and financial problem for swine producers in nearly every country. Group lasso provides an attractive solution to this research question because of its ability to achieve group variable selection and stabilize parameter estimates at the same time. We propose to choose the penalty parameter for group lasso through leave-one-out cross-validation, using the criterion of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Survey data for 896 swine breeding herd sites in the USA and Canada completed between March 2005 and March 2009 are used to construct the risk scoring system for predicting PRRS outbreaks in swine. We show that our scoring system for PRRS significantly improves the current scoring system that is based on an expert opinion. We also show that our proposed scoring system is superior in terms of area under the curve to that developed using multiple logistic regression model selected based on variable significance.",2013,Journal of Applied Statistics
[Death during infancy in Africa: demographic aspects].,"
 In 1989 the infant mortality rate (IMR) in Africa was estimated at 113/1000 in comparison to 10/1000 in North America, 12/1000 in Europe and 55/1000 in Latin America, while child mortality was estimated at 105/1000 compared to 5/1000 in Europe. Between ages 1-5 the common causes of mortality remain infectious and parasitic diseases. In Europe a baby who survives the 1st month of life is practically assured survival in contrast to Africa, especially in the Sahel Region, where the risk of dying increases after the 1st 6 months. Research findings have demonstrated causal factors responsible for increasing the IMR: 1) mother's age; there is a correlation between the death of infants and the mother's age (especially those under 20 or over 35); for older women the IMR's occur after 5-6 births; 2) short birth intervals among Muslims who only abstain 40 days after delivery; included in this growing problem are working and urban women who have shortened the duration of breastfeeding; 3) place of residence (urban/rural) determines access to health facilities; 4) gender differences: male infants have a IMR than females because of lower resistance levels. However in a recent study in 1987 female mortality rates were high from ages 1-5 in Cameroon, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda and Mauritius; demographic survey data demonstrated higher IMR for females between 4-16 in Bamako, Mali, in the rural areas of Thies, Senegal and 8-16 in Bobo-Dioulasso. Recommendations include the education of women as the most important factor to help lower the high incidence of IM in Africa. (Author's modified).

Feature selection based on regularization of sparsity based regression models by hesitant fuzzy correlation,"Abstract In this paper, the Ridge, LASSO and Elastic Net regression methods are adapted for the task of selecting feature. In order to enhance the feature selection performance via these methods, a Hesitant Fuzzy Correlation Matrix (HFCM) is added to the objective functions of these models for addressing the minimum redundancy of features. To this end, the fuzzy C-means clustering is utilized, and the obtained fuzzy clusters are projected on the features in a way that the number of fuzzy Membership Functions (MF) for each feature is equal to the number of clusters. Then, the projected MFs on each feature are considered as a Hesitant Fuzzy Set (HFS), and thereby the hesitant fuzzy correlation between features is calculated. Afterward, the obtained HFCM is employed in the regression methods for securing the minimum redundancy of features. Eventually, the accuracies of the selected features, achieved by these methods, are determined by three different classification models such as Naive Bayes, SVM and Decision Tree. A large number of experiments are conducted over twenty-four classification datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of using HFCM in some classical regression methods.",2020,Applied Soft Computing

Identification of 17 mRNAs and a miRNA as an integrated prognostic signature for lung squamous cell carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND
Gene signatures for predicting the outcome of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) have been employed for many years. However, various signatures have been applied in clinical practice. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to filter out an effective LUSC prognostic gene signature by simultaneously integrating mRNA and miRNA.


METHODS
First, based on data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), mRNAs, and miRNAs that were related to overall survival (OS) of LUSC were obtained by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Subsequently, the predicting effect was tested by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Next, related clinical indexes were added to evaluate the efficiency of the selected gene signatures. Finally, validation and comparison using three independent gene signatures were performed using data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).


RESULTS
Our data showed that the prognostic index (PI) contained 17 mRNAs and one miRNA. According to the best normalized cut-off of PI (0.0247), the hazard radio (HR) of the PI was 3.40 (with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [2.33, 4.96]). Moreover, when clinical factors were introduced, the PI was still the most significant index. In addition, only two GO terms with a p-value of less than 0.05 were reported. In addition, validation implied that using our 18-gene signature, only HR (1.36 [1.01,1.83]) was significant when compared with the other three groups of gene biomarkers.


CONCLUSIONS
The 18-gene signature selected based on data from the TCGA database had an effective prognostic value of LUSC patients.",2019,The journal of gene medicine
Editorial,"This special issue showcases some of the papers presented at the 2017 Colloquium titled â€œA Southern African Dialogue on the Professions and Professional Workâ€ held at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. While the special issue contributes to the conversation on professions and professionalism within southern Africa (see also Bonnin & Ruggunan, 2013; Bonnin & Ruggunan, 2016; Erasmus & Breier, 2009; Young & Muller, 2014), it also opens up a conversation between southern Africa and the economic/political North. Writing in 1972 Johnson (p. 281) noted that â€œthe sociology of professions, as a specialist field, today stands almost alone in ignoring the third worldâ€. Forty-seven years later, it feels as if not much has changed. Annisette (2007, p.245) points to the repeated calls for â€œgreater spatial and temporal diversity in historical research in accountingâ€, while her focus here was on accounting, this call resonates with most research fields in the professions. However, we would argue that not only is there a need for â€œspatial and temporal diversityâ€ but also a need to recognise that the professions in both the global south and the economic north are shaped firstly by colonialism and imperialism, and later, through globalisation and neo-imperialism. Just as Johnson (1982, cited in Annisette, 2000) argued that professionalisation in Britain and its former colonies are linked through the project of imperialism, so the globalisation of professions through the global reach of professional service firms (Faulconbridge & Muzio, 2007), transnational companies and multilateral organisations continues this mutual shaping albeit in a different form (Hopper et al., 2017; Lassou, Hopper, Tsamenyi, & Murinde, 2019). Recognising that the professional project â€œis grounded in history and unfolds through continuous negotiations set in a broader political and economic order ... which over time mobilises different claims, methods, and systems ...â€ (Faulconbridge & Muzio, 2007, p. 10), the articles in this special issue are situated within the specific historical, political and economic context of southern Africa. As they demonstrate colonialism, apartheid, and post-apartheid as well as globalisation and neo-imperialism are all political and economic contexts that are deeply significant when analysing the professions and professionalisation in southern Africa. Southern Africa was first colonised in 1652 when the Dutch occupied land at the Cape of Good Hope. In the decades and centuries that followed, the colonising powers in this region included the Dutch, the French (very briefly) and the British (with Portugal colonising areas slightly north of southern Africa on the west and east coast of the continent). However, by the nineteenth century, Britain was the major colonial power in much of southern Africa. The professions that developed in the region bore the hallmarks of similar professions back in the colonial motherland. The recognition of qualifications; the way in which particular professions developed and organised; and very centrally who, in terms of race and gender, were admitted were all closely bound to the colonial relationship between southern Africa and the imperial power. In 1910 the four British colonies unified to become the Union of South Africaâ€”at first a self-governing dominion under of the British Empire and ISSN: 1893-1049 Volume 9, No 3 (2019), e3598 http://doi.org/10.7577/pp.3598 10.7577/pp.2021 10.7577/pp.2021 10.7577/pp.2021",1997,Mechanisms of Ageing and Development
A Biconvex Analysis for Lasso $\ell _1$  Reweighting,"Iterative <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _1$</tex-math></inline-formula> reweighting algorithms are very popular in sparse signal recovery and compressed sensing, since in the practice they have been observed to outperform classical <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _1$</tex-math></inline-formula> methods. Nevertheless, the theoretical analysis of their convergence is a critical point, and generally is limited to the convergence of the functional to a local minimum or to subsequence convergence. In this letter, we propose a new convergence analysis of a Lasso <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _1$</tex-math></inline-formula> reweighting method, based on the observation that the algorithm is an alternated convex search for a biconvex problem.

Comparison Between Linear and Non-parametric Regression Models for Genome-Enabled Prediction in Wheat,"In genome-enabled prediction, parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric regression models have been used. This study assessed the predictive ability of linear and non-linear models using dense molecular markers. The linear models were linear on marker effects and included the Bayesian LASSO, Bayesian ridge regression, Bayes A, and Bayes B. The non-linear models (this refers to non-linearity on markers) were reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) regression, Bayesian regularized neural networks (BRNN), and radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN). These statistical models were compared using 306 elite wheat lines from CIMMYT genotyped with 1717 diversity array technology (DArT) markers and two traits, days to heading (DTH) and grain yield (GY), measured in each of 12 environments. It was found that the three non-linear models had better overall prediction accuracy than the linear regression specification. Results showed a consistent superiority of RKHS and RBFNN over the Bayesian LASSO, Bayesian ridge regression, Bayes A, and Bayes B models.",2012,G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics

Structure-Activity Analysis of Gram-positive Bacterium-producing Lasso Peptides with Anti-mycobacterial Activity,"Lariatin A, an 18-residue lasso peptide encoded by the five-gene cluster larABCDE, displays potent and selective anti-mycobacterial activity. The structural feature is an N-terminal macrolactam ring, through which the C-terminal passed to form the rigid lariat-protoknot structure. In the present study, we established a convergent expression system by the strategy in which larA mutant gene-carrying plasmids were transformed into larA-deficient Rhodococcus jostii, and generated 36 lariatin variants of the precursor protein LarA to investigate the biosynthesis and the structure-activity relationships. The mutational analysis revealed that four amino acid residues (Gly1, Arg7, Glu8, and Trp9) in lariatin A are essential for the maturation and production in the biosynthetic machinery. Furthermore, the study on structure-activity relationships demonstrated that Tyr6, Gly11, and Asn14 are responsible for the anti-mycobacterial activity, and the residues at positions 15, 16 and 18 in lariatin A are critical for enhancing the activity. This study will not only provide a useful platform for genetically engineering Gram-positive bacterium-producing lasso peptides, but also an important foundation to rationally design more promising drug candidates for combatting tuberculosis.",2016,Scientific Reports
"Potter's tools from the workshop of Sextus Metilius Maximus (Crikvenica, Croatia): an approach to the reconstruction of production technology","Potterâ€™s tools are objects that in antiquity where essential for shaping, levigating and decorating pottery, and whose identification can often be problematic. Nevertheless, in recent years numerous examples from both the eastern Mediterranean (e. g. Sagalassos, Panskoye) and the west (e. g. Corfuâ€™, Scoppieto) have been anlyzed showing a pattern of similarity that characterizes this objects. In fact, most often they are reused objects (combs, hairpins, pottery fragments) but some of them are clearly products of the workshops themselves or are objects used in an â€œalternativeâ€ way. They provide us not only with information on the technology of shaping ceramic objects but also on the choices and know-how of the potters using and producing them. A selection of potterâ€™s tools has been isoleted from the worskshop waste excavated at the site Igraliste in Crikvenica (Croatia) showing both reuse and purposeful production. As the only Roman pottery production center so far identified within the province Dalmatia, Crikvenicaâ€™s pottery workshop serves as an unique example of craft migration and mobility, adaptability and implementation of technology, as a substantial gap with previous local pottery production is noticable. Moreover, the wast array of the figlina products, spanning from amphorae to household pottery and ceramic building materials, open numerous questions on technological, but also practical choices within the production processes. On this occasion an assemblage of tools and kiln implements will be presented suggesting their function and usage on the basis of comparative ancient and ethnoarchaeological examples, and discussing their technological aspects, while placing them in the broader picture of ceramics and pottery production of the Roman world.",2016,
Structural Break Detection in High-Dimensional Non-Stationary VAR models,"Assuming stationarity is unrealistic in many time series applications. A more realistic alternative is to allow for piecewise stationarity, where the model is allowed to change at given time points. In this article, the problem of detecting the change points in a high-dimensional piecewise vector autoregressive model (VAR) is considered. Reformulated the problem as a high-dimensional variable selection, a penalized least square estimation using total variation LASSO penalty is proposed for estimation of model parameters. It is shown that the developed method over-estimates the number of change points. A backward selection criterion is thus proposed in conjunction with the penalized least square estimator to tackle this issue. We prove that the proposed two-stage procedure consistently detects the number of change points and their locations. A block coordinate descent algorithm is developed for efficient computation of model parameters. The performance of the method is illustrated using several simulation scenarios.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Compact Personalized Models for Neural Machine Translation,We propose and compare methods for gradient-based domain adaptation of self-attentive neural machine translation models. We demonstrate that a large proportion of model parameters can be frozen during adaptation with minimal or no reduction in translation quality by encouraging structured sparsity in the set of offset tensors during learning via group lasso regularization. We evaluate this technique for both batch and incremental adaptation across multiple data sets and language pairs. Our system architecture - combining a state-of-the-art self-attentive model with compact domain adaptation - provides high quality personalized machine translation that is both space and time efficient.,2018,ArXiv

Compression of spatio-temporal networks via point-to-point process models,"A point-to-point process describes a dynamic network where a set of edge events are observed, each of which is associated with a time of occurrence and two vertices lying in their state spaces. ÂŒis study intends to investigate one application of such processes, using NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission dataset that reports taxi trips between two locations at a certain time. Here a pointto-point process is formed with edge events being taxi trips and the vertices adjacent to the edge events are pick-up and drop-oÂ‚ locations, described by latitude and longitude pairs. ÂŒe intensity of an edge event can have a temporal dependence in addition to being dependent on a latent, spatially-coherent community structure for the vertices. To this end, we have developed a methodology that estimates a spatially smoothed community structure and localizes temporal changepoints for point-to-point processes. By applying this to our dataset, we can explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of the demand of taxi trips. More speciÂ€cally, with reasonable assumptions, the latent community structure is estimated by spectral partitioning based on a low-rank reconstruction of aggregated taxitrip network; and the temporal changepoint localization can be carried out by solving a matrix group fused LASSO program.",2017,
L1 Regularized Regression Modeling of Functional Connectivity,"A network is referred to as â€˜denseâ€™ when there are a large number of connections between nodes in the network. A sparse network alternatively has a small number of connected nodes. At times it is beneficial to â€˜sparsifyâ€™ a dense network to make the data easier to interpret. The brain itself is a very dense network with brain regions representing the nodes of the network, and the neurological pathways between regions representing the connections. We chose to investigate the statistical method known as the Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator (LASSO), as proposed by Tibshirani et. al. (J Roy Stat Soc B 58.1:267â€“288, 1996), as a feature selection tool to be applied to functional connectivity data. This method is useful in cases when the number of subjects is significantly less than the number of variables. A shrinkage parameter causes a number of variables to be shrunk to zero, creating a sparser network. In this chapter, we analyze data from 86 social regions of the brain of 60 subjects that were identified as either neuro-typical disorder (TD) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This created a network with 3656 pairwise correlations as predictor variables. At the same time, LASSO fits the remaining variables to a model which can be used to â€˜predictâ€™ whether a subject belongs to the TD or ASD classification.",2015,
"Obesity, Central Obesity, Overweight and Diabetes: Women are the Most Affected in Burkina Faso","Objective: To determine the importance of obesity and analyze the relationship between general obesity and central obesity in persons with diabetes monitored in Bobo-Dioulasso teaching hospital. 
Methods: We used a sample of 380 persons with diabetes recruited through a study on compliance with follow-up examinations. Overweight and obesity were researched using the Quetelet index, or Body Mass Index [BMI], which is defined as the individualâ€™s mass divided by the square of their height, as well as waist size. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression were used [p<0.05]. 
Results: We found that 22.6% were obese [n=86], 29.2% were overweight [n=111] and 65.3% had central obesity [n=240]. The majority of obese [98.8%] and overweight cases [87.4%] and also 40.0% of those with normal BMI [n=160] and 8.6% of underweight cases [n=23] had central obesity. Being a woman was associated with general and central obesity. In a univariate analysis, obese were more likely to be woman, educated, have low incomes, reside in urban areas and have central obesity and a metabolic syndrome; central obesity is associated with being a woman, having a low income, residing in an urban area and having hypertension, obesity and a metabolic syndrome. In a multivariate analysis, being a woman, educated and having central obesity was found to be associated with obesity. On the other hand, being a woman, residing in an urban area and having hypertension, obesity and a metabolic syndrome remained associated with central obesity. 
Conclusion: Obesity, and above all, central obesityis a big problem in persons with diabetes, particularly in women in Bobo-Dioulasso, and waist size seems to be a better measurement compared to BMI. These results call for more organized diabetes care and prevention in Burkina Faso.",2014,Journal of women's health care
Confidence intervals and regions for the lasso by using stochastic variational inequality techniques in optimization,"Summary 
 
Sparse regression techniques have been popular in recent years because of their ability in handling high dimensional data with built-in variable selection. The lasso is perhaps one of the most well-known examples. Despite intensive work in this direction, how to provide valid inference for sparse regularized methods remains a challenging statistical problem. We take a unique point of view of this problem and propose to make use of stochastic variational inequality techniques in optimization to derive confidence intervals and regions for the lasso. Some theoretical properties of the procedure are obtained. Both simulated and real data examples are used to demonstrate the performance of the method.",2017,Journal of The Royal Statistical Society Series B-statistical Methodology
The dangers of dirt : household hygiene and health,"Encouraging changes in hygiene practices are potentially one of the mosteffective means of reducing the global impact of diarrhoeal diseases, whichkill an estimated 3.3 million children a year. However, efforts to improve hygiene in the developing world have met with limited success. Some of thereasons behind this include: the complexity of the subject of hygiene the problem of how to identify and target only a few specific household risk practices the difficulty of measuring hygiene behaviour accurately the lack of available methods for understanding what hygiene means to people the lack of strategic thinking in planning interventions. This thesis presents the results from nine years work on these problems from the town of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso and elsewhere. The first chapter addresses the subject of hygiene in general and suggests that it has dual origins; in the need for individual and social order, and also in the need to avoid disease. The second chapter evaluates the specific hygiene practices most likely to put health at risk. The literature on thesubject suggests that practices which can reduce the faecal contamination of the household environment, such as safe stool disposal and hand-washing with soap after contact with stools, are likely to be of greatest protective value. The problem of the measurement of hygiene behaviour is addressed in chapters four to six, which conclude that structured observations are probably the most valid and practical tool available orrecording hygiene practices. The thesis then goes on to address the question of how hygiene was understood by mothers in Bobo-Dioulasso, and concludes that mothers saw little connection between hygiene and diarrhoeal diseases, but that hygiene was very important to them as a positive social value. In the final chapters the lessons learned from the work in Bobo are fitted into a framework that can be used to design hygiene promotion programmes in the future. This employs a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods to carry out a systematic programme of formative research that combines what people know, do and want, with the available scientific knowledge. The results provide a rational basis for the design of hygiene promotion programmes. A trial of the effectiveness of this new approach to hygiene promotion is currently underway in Burkina Faso.",1998,
Learning Local Dependence In Ordered Data,"In many applications, data come with a natural ordering. This ordering can often induce local dependence among nearby variables. However, in complex data, the width of this dependence may vary, making simple assumptions such as a constant neighborhood size unrealistic. We propose a framework for learning this local dependence based on estimating the inverse of the Cholesky factor of the covariance matrix. Penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this matrix yields a simple regression interpretation for local dependence in which variables are predicted by their neighbors. Our proposed method involves solving a convex, penalized Gaussian likelihood problem with a hierarchical group lasso penalty. The problem decomposes into independent subproblems which can be solved efficiently in parallel using first-order methods. Our method yields a sparse, symmetric, positive definite estimator of the precision matrix, encoding a Gaussian graphical model. We derive theoretical results not found in existing methods attaining this structure. In particular, our conditions for signed support recovery and estimation consistency rates in multiple norms are as mild as those in a regression problem. Empirical results show our method performing favorably compared to existing methods. We apply our method to genomic data to flexibly model linkage disequilibrium. Our method is also applied to improve the performance of discriminant analysis in sound recording classification.",2017,J. Mach. Learn. Res.
Prognostic MicroRNAs in Cancer Tissue from Patients Operated for Pancreatic Cancerâ€”Five MicroRNAs in a Prognostic Index,"BackgroundThe aim of the present study was to identify a panel of microRNAs (miRNAs) that can predict overall survival (OS) in non micro-dissected cancer tissues from patients operated for pancreatic cancer (PC).MethodsMiRNAs were purified from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cancer tissue from 225 patients operated for PC. Only a few of those patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Expressions of miRNAs were determined with the TaqMan MicroRNA Array v2.0. Two statistical methods, univariate selection and the Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) method, were applied in conjunction with the Cox proportional hazard model to relate miRNAs to OS.ResultsHigh expression of miR-212 and miR-675 and low expression of miR-148a*, miR-187, and let-7g* predicted short OS independent of age, gender, calendar year of operation, KRAS mutation status, tumor stage, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, localization (not miR-148a*), and differentiation of tumor. A prognostic index (PI) based on these five miRNAs was calculated for each patient. The median survival was 1.09 years (Confidence Interval [CI] 0.98â€“1.43) for PI > median PI compared to 2.23 years (CI 1.84â€“4.36) for PI < median. MiR-212, miR-675, miR-187, miR-205, miR-944, miR-431, miR-194*, miR-148a*, and miR-769-5p showed the strongest prediction ability by the Lasso method. Thus miR-212, miR-675, miR-187, and miR-148a* were predictors for OS in both statistical methods.ConclusionsThe combination of five miRNAs expression in non micro-dissected FFPE PC tissue can identify patients with short OS after radical surgery. The results are independent of chemotherapy treatment. Patients with a prognostic index > median had a very short median OS of only 1 year.",2012,World Journal of Surgery
"A Temporal Examination of Platelet Counts as a Predictor of Prognosis in Lung, Prostate, and Colon Cancer Patients","Platelets, components of hemostasis, when present in excess (>400â€‰K/Î¼L, thrombocytosis) have also been associated with worse outcomes in lung, ovarian, breast, renal, and colorectal cancer patients. Associations between thrombocytosis and cancer outcomes have been made mostly from single-time-point studies, often at the time of diagnosis. Using laboratory data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), we examined the potential benefits of using longitudinal platelet counts in improving patient prognosis predictions. Ten features (summary statistics and engineered features) were derived to describe the platelet counts of 10,000+â€‰VA lung, prostate, and colon cancer patients and incorporated into an age-adjusted LASSO regression analysis to determine feature importance, and predict overall or relapse-free survival, which was compared to the previously used approach of monitoring for thrombocytosis near diagnosis (Postdiag AG400 model). Temporal features describing acute platelet count increases/decreases were found to be important in cancer survival and relapse-survival that helped stratify good and bad outcomes of cancer patient groups. Predictions of overall and relapse-free survival were improved by up to 30% compared to the Postdiag AG400 model. Our study indicates the association of temporally derived platelet count features with a patientsâ€™ prognosis predictions.",2018,Scientific Reports
A Message-Passing Receiver for BICM-OFDM Over Unknown Clustered-Sparse Channels,"We propose a factor-graph-based approach to joint channel-estimation-and-decoding (JCED) of bit-interleaved coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (BICM-OFDM). In contrast to existing designs, ours is capable of exploiting not only sparsity in sampled channel taps but also clustering among the large taps, behaviors which are known to manifest at larger communication bandwidths. In order to exploit these channel-tap structures, we adopt a two-state Gaussian mixture prior in conjunction with a Markov model on the hidden state. For loopy belief propagation, we exploit a â€œgeneralized approximate message passingâ€ (GAMP) algorithm recently developed in the context of compressed sensing, and show that it can be successfully coupled with soft-input soft-output decoding, as well as hidden Markov inference, through the standard sum-product framework. For N subcarriers and any channel length L<;N, the resulting JCED-GAMP scheme has a computational complexity of only O(N log2 N +N|S|), where |S| is the constellation size.

Using Multivariate Regression Model with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to Predict the Incidence of Xerostomia after Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to develop a multivariate logistic regression model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to make valid predictions about the incidence of moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients treated with IMRT.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
Quality of life questionnaire datasets from 206 patients with HNC were analyzed. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-H&N35 and QLQ-C30 questionnaires were used as the endpoint evaluation. The primary endpoint (grade 3(+) xerostomia) was defined as moderate-to-severe xerostomia at 3 (XER3m) and 12 months (XER12m) after the completion of IMRT. Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models were developed. The optimal and suboptimal numbers of prognostic factors for a multivariate logistic regression model were determined using the LASSO with bootstrapping technique. Statistical analysis was performed using the scaled Brier score, Nagelkerke R(2), chi-squared test, Omnibus, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and the AUC.


RESULTS
Eight prognostic factors were selected by LASSO for the 3-month time point: Dmean-c, Dmean-i, age, financial status, T stage, AJCC stage, smoking, and education. Nine prognostic factors were selected for the 12-month time point: Dmean-i, education, Dmean-c, smoking, T stage, baseline xerostomia, alcohol abuse, family history, and node classification. In the selection of the suboptimal number of prognostic factors by LASSO, three suboptimal prognostic factors were fine-tuned by Hosmer-Lemeshow test and AUC, i.e., Dmean-c, Dmean-i, and age for the 3-month time point. Five suboptimal prognostic factors were also selected for the 12-month time point, i.e., Dmean-i, education, Dmean-c, smoking, and T stage. The overall performance for both time points of the NTCP model in terms of scaled Brier score, Omnibus, and Nagelkerke R(2) was satisfactory and corresponded well with the expected values.


CONCLUSIONS
Multivariate NTCP models with LASSO can be used to predict patient-rated xerostomia after IMRT.",2014,PLoS ONE
"[Isolation of pathogenic Mycobacterium strains in cattle slaughtered in the abattoir of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso].","The major cause of meat rejection at the slaughterhouse of Bobo-Dioulasso is bovine tuberculosis. The objective of this work was to confirm the postmortem diagnosis pronounced at the slaughterhouse using laboratory methods (direct examination following Ziehl-Hielsen staining and isolation of Mycobacterium strains following culture in a Loewenstein-Jensen medium. During the study, 39 pathogenic Mycobacterium strains (38 Mycobacterium bovis and 1 Mycobacterium tuberculosis) out of 100 sampled out suspicious strains, were studied. No Mycobacteria typical of M. farcinogenes was found on direct examination. We were then able to differentiate between bovine tuberculosis and bovine farcy. The results confirm the well-founded decision in the slaughterhouse to discard the meat on the grounds of tuberculosis. The majority of cattle is located in villages around Bobo-Dioulasso and its is therefore highly likely that the disease is enzootic in the area with a fairly high level of infection in animals.",1995,Revue d'elevage et de medecine veterinaire des pays tropicaux
Sparse support recovery using correlation information in the presence of additive noise,"The correlation based framework has recently been proposed for sparse support recovery in noiseless case. To solve this framework, the constrained least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was employed. The regularization parameter in the constrained LASSO was found to be a key to the recovery. This paper will discuss the sparse support recoverability via the framework and adjustment of the regularization parameter in noisy case. The main contribution is to provide noise-related conditions to guarantee the sparse support recovery. It is pointed out that the candidates of the regularization parameter taken from the noise-related region can achieve the optimization and the effect of the noise cannot be ignored. When the number of the samples is finite, the sparse support recoverability is further discussed by estimating the recovery probability for the fixed regularization parameter in the region. The asymptotic consistency is obtained in probabilistic sense when the number of the samples tends to infinity. Simulations are given to demonstrate the validity of our results.",2017,Multidimensional Systems and Signal Processing
Prediction of benign and malignant breast masses using digital mammograms texture features,"Abstract Background Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant disease for women. Mammography is the preferred method for breast cancer detection. The purpose is to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of texture features extracted from digital mammograms at predicting benign and malignant breast mass using Radiomics. Methods 494 digital mammograms data who diagnosed as breast masses (Benign: 251 Malignant: 243) by mammography were enrolled. Enrol criteria: breast masses classified as BI-RADS 3, 4, and 5 and at last confirmed by histopathology. Lesion area was marked with a rectangular frame on the Cranio-Caudal (CC) and MedioLateral Oblique (MLO) images at the 5M workstation. The rectangular regions of interest (ROI) was segmented and 456 radiomics features were extracted from every ROI. Extracted features were dimensioned by Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR) and Lasso algorithm. Post-dimension features were classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM). 70% of the data as a training set and the other 30% as a testing set. The reliability of the Classifier was evaluated by the 10-fold cross-validation. The classification accuracy was evaluated by the accuracy and sensitivity and AUC. Results Both the MRMR and Lasso screened 30 radiomics features respectively. 10-fold cross-validation showed that their accuracy were 88.70% and 86.71%, respectively. In testing sets, Through the MRMR algorithm, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 92.00% and a sensitivity of 91.10% and AUC of 95.10%. Through the lasso dimension reduction algorithm, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 83.26% and a sensitivity of 75.90% and AUC of 89.38%. Conclusions Radiomics texture features from digital mammograms may be used for benign and malignant prediction. This method offer better accuracy and sensitivity. It is expected to provide an auxiliary diagnosis for the imaging doctors. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors. Funding Has not received any funding.

Diagnosis of prostate cancer by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometric imaging of small metabolites and lipids.,"Accurate identification of prostate cancer in frozen sections at the time of surgery can be challenging, limiting the surgeon's ability to best determine resection margins during prostatectomy. We performed desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) on 54 banked human cancerous and normal prostate tissue specimens to investigate the spatial distribution of a wide variety of small metabolites, carbohydrates, and lipids. In contrast to several previous studies, our method included Krebs cycle intermediates (m/z <200), which we found to be highly informative in distinguishing cancer from benign tissue. Malignant prostate cells showed marked metabolic derangements compared with their benign counterparts. Using the ""Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator"" (Lasso), we analyzed all metabolites from the DESI-MS data and identified parsimonious sets of metabolic profiles for distinguishing between cancer and normal tissue. In an independent set of samples, we could use these models to classify prostate cancer from benign specimens with nearly 90% accuracy per patient. Based on previous work in prostate cancer showing that glucose levels are high while citrate is low, we found that measurement of the glucose/citrate ion signal ratio accurately predicted cancer when this ratio exceeds 1.0 and normal prostate when the ratio is less than 0.5. After brief tissue preparation, the glucose/citrate ratio can be recorded on a tissue sample in 1 min or less, which is in sharp contrast to the 20 min or more required by histopathological examination of frozen tissue specimens.",2017,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Nanofabrication: reversible self-assembly of an imbedded hexameric metallomacrocycle within a macromolecular superstructure.,"Molecular imprinting processes widely occur in complex biosystems, thus, selective and specific guests bound by antibodies, such as hormones, are vital for basic cellâ€“cell communication. Experimental simulation of cell imprinting has been predominately developed by using bulk polymerizations in which guests, or templates, are used to create a molecular â€œimpressionâ€ through incorporation within the infrastructure of appropriately juxtaposed ionic, hydrogen-bonding, or other noncovalent loci. 5] Typically organic guests are used as the template from which, after its removal, the cavity, the shape, and the directivity of the host s binding site are frozen for subsequent re-recognition of structurally related guests. Zimmerman et al. developed a novel monomolecular imprinting process, whereby porphyrin-cored dendrimers having terminal alkene units were initially created, and subsequent alkene cross-linking gave the hostâ€“guest combination; porphyrin removal thus created the desired cavity possessing the desired recognition sites. van Koten and co-workers employed this technique for the creation of a 69-membered macrocycle that reversibly accepts a pre-assembled platinum triad. Such hostâ€“guest molecular recognition generally relies on intermolecular assembly of components. Can the self-assembly process occur by an intramolecular mechanism in which a macromolecular skeleton has multiple ligands capable of reversible assemblyâ€“ disassembly which is triggered by the presence of metal ions?We herein describe a simple method allowing molecular nanofabrication by such a procedure. Based on our previous work concerning the hexameric self-assembly of meta-bis(terpyridinyl)arenes having the critical 1208 angle with respect to the two ligating moieties, we noted that the Fe hexamer is more sensitive to basic conditions compared to the more robust Ru analogue; thus under basic conditions, demetalation quantitatively regenerated the starting bis-ligand. Colasson and Sauvage have similarly shown that the related [tpy2Cu] (tpy= terpyridine) complex can also be destroyed by KCN. Such a facile disassembly process coupled with the high-yield hexamer macrocyclization suggested the possibly of reversible assembly in an appropriate molecular nanotemplate. Herein, we describe a reversible, assemblyâ€“disassembly procedure involving a hexametallomacrocycle containing twelve terpyridine groups enclosed within a 114-membered macrocyclic structure (Figure 1).",2005,Angewandte Chemie
Efficient and Accelerated Online Learning for Sparse Group Lasso,"The batch-mode group lasso algorithms suffer from the inefficiency and poor scalability, and online learning algorithms for group lasso, is a promising tool for attacking the large-scale problem. However, the low time complexity of current online algorithm often be accompanied by low convergence rate, and the faster convergence rate is a key problem to guarantee the online learning algorithms. We develop a novel accelerated online learning algorithm to solve sparse group lasso model. The sparse group lasso model can achieve more sparsity in both the group level and the individual feature level. By adopting dual averaging method, its worst-case time complexity and memory cost at each iteration are both in the order of O (d), where d is the number of dimensions. Moreover, our online algorithm has a accelerated capability, and its theoretical convergence rate is O (1/T2) up to T-th step. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the merits of the proposed online algorithm for sparse group lasso.",2014,2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshop
UV-induced DNA damage in coral reef fish: damage levels and protection mechanisms,"Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the surface of earth has been recognized as a major environmental stressor for marine organisms due to the potential of UVB (280 315 nm) to induce DNA damage such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) that can lead to cell death. Despite inhabiting a UV-rich environment, the levels of DNA damage in reef fish and factors influencing these levels are unknown. Whether reef fish are able to avoid UVR and repair UV-induced DNA damage is unclear despite the importance of these protection mechanisms in other animals. The presence of UV-absorbing Mycosporine-like Amino Acids (MAAs) in the external mucus of reef fish has been confirmed, however the efficiency of these compounds in preventing CPDs has not been studied. The aim of this PhD was to assess the impact of ambient and elevated levels of UVR on reef fish in terms of UV-induced DNA damage, and to evaluate the protective mechanisms available to fish with and without UV vision. In order to determine the net level of DNA damage in skin samples of 15 species of fish from the reefs surrounding Lizard Island, a CPD-specific antibody was used in an ELISA. Analysis using a boosted regression tree shows that the most important factors governing CPDs were species and size, with higher damage being detected in smaller individuals. Other factors such as family, depth and the presence or absence of UV vision contributed the least to the variation in damage. The length of exposure to natural levels of UVR over the course of a day was found to have no significant influence on net DNA damage levels, which were relatively low in situ, compared to levels that were detected in later experiments using elevated UVR. The first protection mechanism, behavioural avoidance to UVR, was tested using behavioural experiments in which fish with (Pomacentrus amboinensis) and without UV vision (Thalassoma lunare) were given a choice between UV-protected and UV-exposed compartments. Additionally, foraging behaviour of settlement-stage larvae of P. amboinensis was determined under ambient levels of UVR. Automated analysis of video footage using MatLab shows that neither species showed a specific avoidance response to varying levels of UVB. Although P. amboinensis showed a preference for deeper sections of the experimental tanks, fish spent equal amounts of time in exposed and protected compartments. The foraging activity and distance to shelter of P. amboinensis that were exposed to UVR were significantly reduced compared to fish that were observed under light conditions that lacked UVR. Next, the efficiency of natural sunscreens, MAAs, in preventing CPDs was tested in P. amboinensis and T. lunare. The levels of MAAs in the mucus of the two species were either reduced or maintained during captivity before exposure to a short pulse of high UVR. Spectrometric measurements of light transmission through mucus samples collected after irradiation were used to quantify the amount of MAAs available for protection. In both species, DNA damage levels in skin samples from UVR exposed individuals was higher than in control groups that were exposed to light lacking the UV component. Spectrometric measurements of external mucus of both species revealed a clear link between higher mucus absorbance, i.e. MAA levels, and lower DNA damage levels. Furthermore, a significant increase in mucus absorption was observed in P. amboinensis after UV exposure. The last protection mechanism, the ability to revert DNA damage via photoreactivation and dark repair was investigated in four species (P. amboinensis, Pomacentrus moluccensis, Lethrinus variegatus and Siganus corallinus). All species examined showed significant increases of DNA damage after exposure to elevated UVR levels. Interspecific variation in the susceptibility to UVR was observed, with L. variegatus showing the highest damage levels. Significant reductions in DNA damage levels were found in P. moluccensis and L. variegatus that were exposed to photoreactivating light after the initial damage accumulation. Individuals of P. moluccensis that were shielded from any light exposure post UVR exposure also showed less DNA damage at the end of the experiment. This is the first study to address levels of UV-induced DNA damage in reef fish under natural conditions as well as under elevated doses of UVR that could occur in a changing climate. The relatively low levels of CPDs in a diverse group of reef fish indicate that current levels of UVR pose only low threat and underline the importance of protection mechanisms against UVR. Increases in UVR could have an impact not only on adult fish capable of adjusting their protection mechanisms, but also settlement stage larvae which show some of the highest levels of DNA damage in situ as well as mortality during slight increases of UVR. Whether these and other effects such as decreased foraging activity have broader implications on the recruitment and reproduction of reef fish and the community structure on coral reefs needs to be examined in the future.

Online visual vocabulary pruning using pairwise constraints,"Given a pair of images represented using bag-of-visual-words and a label corresponding to whether the images are â€œrelatedâ€(must-link constraint) or â€œunrelatedâ€ (cannot-link constraint), we address the problem of selecting a subset of visual words that are salient in explaining the relation between the image pair. In particular, a subset of features is selected such that the distance computed using these features satisfies the given pairwise constraints. An efficient online feature selection algorithm is presented based on the dual-gradient descent approach. Side information in the form of pair-wise constraints is incorporated into the feature selection stage, providing the user with flexibility to use an unsupervised or semi-supervised algorithm at a later stage. Correlated subsets of visual words, usually resulting from hierarchical quantization process (called groups), are exploited to select a significantly smaller vocabulary. A group-LASSO regularizer is used to drive as many feature weights to zero as possible. We evaluate the quality of the pruned vocabulary by clustering the data using the resulting feature subset. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset using 5000 visual keywords, resulted in around 80% reduction in the number of keywords, with little or no loss in performance.",2010,2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
Regularized inverse holographic volume reconstruction for 3D particle tracking.,"The key limitations of digital inline holography (DIH) for particle tracking applications are poor longitudinal resolution, particle concentration limits, and case-specific processing. We utilize an inverse problem method with fused lasso regularization to perform full volumetric reconstructions of particle fields. By exploiting data sparsity in the solution and utilizing GPU processing, we dramatically reduce the computational cost usually associated with inverse reconstruction approaches. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method using synthetic and experimental holograms. Finally, we present two practical applications (high concentration microorganism swimming and microfiber rotation) to extend the capabilities of DIH beyond what was possible using prior methods.",2019,Optics express
"Chronic pain, somatic unexplained complaints and multimorbidity: A mutimorbidity painful syndrome?","INTRODUCTION
Chronic illnesses are a major research challenge due to its implications in aging and quality of life of adults and elders, and it can be associated with chronic illnesses and other complaints. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of morbidities (chronic diseases with or without somatic unexplained symptoms) and somatic unexplained complaints in a hypothetical model of a multimorbidity painful syndrome. Our hypothesis is that chronic pain should be considered part of a syndrome that includes other chronic diseases and pathological states, especially conditions with somatic unexplained symptoms, and fibromyalgia is one of the evidence on that.


METHODS
A pilot sample of 306 subjects was investigated in this study (254; 83.0% with chronic pain). The following features were investigated: demographic data, chronic diseases (classified as with or without somatic unexplained symptoms), medications in use, pain characteristics, fulfillment of diagnostic criteria of fibromyalgia, and somatic unexplained complaints (gastric complaints, sleep disturbances, numbness, and the dry mucosa score). Statistical analysis included descriptive data, tested with chi-square, Fisher's exact, nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnoff, Student's t test; data normalization with Z-score; Pearson's coefficient for correlation, two-steps cluster classification, multivariate linear regression, LASSO and logistic regression.


RESULTS
Both groups of chronic diseases were more prevalent in the group of patients (pÂ <Â 0.001 and pÂ =Â 0.013, respectively), which had higher frequency of somatic unexplained complaints (gastrointestinal, dry mucosa and numbness) than controls. There was a high positive correlation between number of pain areas and somatic unexplained symptoms score (R2Â =Â 0.626; pÂ <Â 0.001), and diseases with these symptoms were a risk factor for chronic pain (R2Â =Â 0.5748) and fibromyalgia (AICÂ =Â 5.8952).


CONCLUSIONS
Diseases with somatic unexplained symptoms and somatic unexplained complaints were associated with chronic pain, including fibromyalgia. They may be risks factors for pain spread. The findings support that chronic pain could be further investigated as part of a multimorbid syndrome, which should be better assessed to improve aging and quality of life of patients.",2020,Medical hypotheses
Aeroelastic Model Structure Computation for Envelope Expansion,"Structure detection is a procedure for selecting a subset of candidate terms, from a full model description, that best describes the observed output. This is a necessary procedure to compute an efficient system description which may afford greater insight into the functionality of the system or a simpler controller design. Structure computation as a tool for black-box modelling may be of critical importance in the development of robust, parsimonious models for the flight-test community. Moreover, this approach may lead to efficient strategies for rapid envelope expansion which may save significant development time and costs. In this study, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique is investigated for computing efficient model descriptions of nonlinear aeroelastic systems. The LASSO minimises the residual sum of squares by the addition of an â€˜1 penalty term on the parameter vector of the traditional â€˜2 minimisation problem. Its use for structure detection is a natural extension of this constrained minimisation approach to pseudolinear regression problems which produces some model parameters that are exactly zero and, therefore, yields a parsimonious system description. Applicability of this technique for model structure computation for the F/A-18 Active Aeroelastic Wing using flight test data is shown for several flight conditions (Mach numbers) by identifying a parsimonious system description with a high percent fit for cross-validated data.",2007,
Asymptotic Confidence Regions Based on the Adaptive Lasso with Partial Consistent Tuning,We construct confidence sets based on an adaptive Lasso estimator with componentwise tuning in the framework of a low-dimensional linear regression model. We consider the case where at least one of the components is penalized at the rate of consistent model selection and where certain components may not be penalized at all. We perform a detailed study of the consistency properties and the asymptotic distribution that includes the effects of componentwise tuning within a so-called moving-parameter framework. These results enable us to explicitly provide a set $\mathcal{M}$ such that every open superset acts as a confidence set with uniform asymptotic coverage equal to 1 whereas every proper closed subset with non-empty interior is a confidence set with uniform asymptotic coverage equal to 0. The shape of the set $\mathcal{M}$ depends on the regressor matrix as well as the deviations within the componentwise tuning parameters. Our findings can be viewed as a generalization of Potscher & Schneider (2010) who considered confidence intervals based on components of the adaptive Lasso estimator for the case of orthogonal regressors.,2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Compressive sensing optical coherence tomography using randomly accessible lasers,"We propose and demonstrate a novel a compressive sensing swept source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) system that enables high speed images to be taken while maintaining the high resolution offered from a large bandwidth sweep. Conventional SSOCT systems sweep the optical frequency of a laser Ï‰(t) to determine the depth of the reflectors at a given lateral location. A scatterer located at delay Ï„ appears as a sinusoid cos (Ï‰(t)Ï„ ) at the photodetector. The finite optical chirp rate and the speed of analog to digital and digital to analog converters limit the acquisition rate of an axial scan. The proposed acquisition modality enables much faster image acquisition rates by interrogating the beat signal at randomly selected optical frequencies while preserving resolution and depth of field. The system utilizes a randomly accessible laser, a modulated grating Y-branch laser, to sample the interference pattern from a scene at randomly selected optical frequencies over an optical bandwidth of 5 THz , corresponding to a resolution of 30 Î¼m in air. The depth profile is then reconstructed using an l1 minimization algorithm with a LASSO constraint. Signal-dependent noise sources, shot noise and phase noise, are analyzed and taken into consideration during the recovery. Redundant dictionaries are used to improve the reconstruction of the depth profile. A compression by a factor of 10 for sparse targets up to a depth of 15 mm in noisy environments is shown.",2014,

Universality of the LASSO Cost âˆ—,"Consider the linear inverse problem of reconstructing a vector x0 âˆˆ R from a noisy linear observation y = Ax0 + w, where A âˆˆ RmÃ—n is random with independent and identically distributed entries, using the LASSO, which is the following optimization problem: OPT (A) = min xâˆˆRn 1 n { 1 2 â€–Axâˆ’ yâ€– 2 2 + Î» â€–xâ€–1 } . Consider the asymptotic regime n â†’ âˆž and m/n â†’ Î´ > 0, Î´ 6= 1. For a given fixed Î» > 0, we show that universality (with respect to the randomness of A) holds for the LASSO cost OPT (A). As an intermediate step in the proof, we obtain an extension of Kashinâ€™s theorem, which could be of independent interests. 1 Statement of the Result Consider the linear model y = Ax0 + w, where x0 âˆˆ Rn is a vector to be reconstructed from the observation y, A âˆˆ RmÃ—n is the (known) sensing matrix, and w âˆˆ Rm is the (unknown) noise. When m < n, the problem is underdetermined, and is generally encountered in compressed sensing and high-dimensional statistics. A common approach to this problem is to consider the LASSO: OPT (A) = min xâˆˆRn 1 n {1 2 â€–Axâˆ’ yâ€– 2 2 + Î» â€–xâ€–1 } (1) = min xâˆˆRn 1 n C (x,A) , (2) in which C (x,A) = 2 â€–A (xâˆ’ x0)âˆ’wâ€– 2 2 + Î» â€–xâ€–1 (3) for a given pre-chosen parameter Î» > 0. To lighten the notation, we have dropped the dependence on x0, w and Î» in C (x,A) and OPT (A). We focus on the asymptotic regime nâ†’âˆž, thinking of the above as a sequence (in n) of problem instances. The main purpose of this note is to establish a universality property of OPT (A), stated in the following. Theorem 1.

Pattern alternating maximization algorithm for missing data in high-dimensional problems,"We propose a novel and efficient algorithm for maximizing the observed log-likelihood of a multivariate normal data matrix with missing values. We show that our procedure, based on iteratively regressing the missing on the observed variables, generalizes the standard EM algorithm by alternating between different complete data spaces and performing the E-Step incrementally. In this non-standard setup we prove numerical convergence to a stationary point of the observed log-likelihood. For high-dimensional data, where the number of variables may greatly exceed sample size, we perform regularization using a Lasso-type penalty. This introduces sparsity in the regression coefficients used for imputation, permits fast computation and warrants competitive performance in terms of estimating the missing entries. We show on simulated and real data that the new method often improves upon other modern imputation techniques such as k-nearest neighbors imputation, nuclear norm minimization or a penalized likelihood approach with an l1-penalty on the concentration matrix.",2014,J.

Using penalized likelihood to select parameters in a random coefficients multinomial logit model,"The multinomial logit model with random coefficients is widely used in applied research. This paper is concerned with estimating a random coefficients logit model in which the distribution of each coefficient is characterized by finitely many parameters. Some of these parameters may be zero or close to zero in a sense that is defined. We call these parameters small. The paper gives conditions under which with probability approaching 1 as the sample size approaches infinity, penalized maximum likelihood estimation (PMLE) with the adaptive LASSO (AL) penalty function distinguishes correctly between large and small parameters in a random-coefficients logit model. If one or more parameters are small, then PMLE with the AL penalty function reduces the asymptotic mean-square estimation error of any continuously differentiable function of the modelâ€™s parameters, such as a market share, the value of travel time, or an elasticity. The paper describes a method for computing the PMLE of a random-coefficients logit model. It also presents the results of Monte Carlo experiments that illustrate the numerical performance of the PMLE. Finally, it presents the results of PMLE estimation of a random-coefficients logit model of choice among brands of butter and margarine in the British groceries market.",2019,Journal of Econometrics
"The late Cretaceous and Paleogene palynological assemblages from Xuanzhou, Anhui Province","In order to explore the nature of the Cretaceous-Tertiary depositional successions of continental basins in South China, samples for palynological study were systematically collected in 1984 with a China-Germany Research Team from the Xuannan Formation and the Shuangta Group in Xuanzhou, which used to be referred as the Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary respectively. Fossil spores and pollen are sparse in the Xuannan Formation consisting mainly of red beds of siltstone and mudstone with intercalations of yellow, grayish green and black mudstone and were found from two samples of fine-grained black siltstone in its middle part outcropped in Hanting Town. Forty-two species of 26 genera can be identified. Among them, 53.5% belong to angiosperm pollen, including 16.6% of Ulmipollenites and Ulmoideipites, 7.5% of pollen of Betulaepollenites and Betulaceoipollenites, and other porate pollen such as Engelhardtioidites, Momipites etc. Gymnospermous pollen constitute 15% of the total grains and are dominated by Classopollis and then, Exesipollenites and Rugubivesiculites. Spores of ferns make up as much as 31% of the total grains with a dominance of Schizaeoisporites, which reaches 16.6% of the total grains. Composition of this palynological assemblage is characteristic of those from the Late Cretaceous deposits in China such as the Wangshi Formation in western Shandong, The 1 st and 2 nd Members of the Taizhou Formation in northern Jiangsu, the Dalangshan Formation in the Sanshui Basin of Guangdong. Occurrence of such assemblage suggests an age of Cenonian and a dry climate condition in tropic and subtropic region. Fossil spores and pollen from the Shuangta Group outcropped at Luosigang and nearby the Xuancheng Middle School, which is composed of dark brown and red silty clay and clay beds, are abundant as well as highly diverse and contain 169 species of 70 genera. Diversity of angiosperm pollen are particularly high, consisting of 110 species of 51 genera and being up to 67.2% of total grains. Tricolporate grains, including Lonicerapollis, Pentapollinites, Rhoipites etc, predominate in this assemblage. Tricolpate pollens are dominated by Quercoidites including porate pollen, consisting of Betulaepollenites, Betulaceoipollenites, Carpinipites, Engelhardtioidites, Momipites, Ulmipollenites, Ulmoideipites etc, are diverse but low in quantity. The content of gymnospermous pollen ranges from 18.8% to 32.3% of the total grains and are dominated by coniferal saccate pollen of the coniferales. Spores of ferns make up from 11.5% to 16.4% of the total grains with a dominance of Pterisisporites, and less abundant Polypodiaceoisporites, Verrutetraspora etc. This palynological assemblage shares the characteristic composition of the Eocene microfloras from the 2 nd and 3 rd Members of the Changhe Group in Zhejiang. It represents a flora dominated by evergreen broadleaf forest with flourishing fern under shadow of forest in a wet climate condition of subtropic region.",2005,
Fecal Carriage of Enterobacteriaceae Producing Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases in Hospitalized Patients and Healthy Community Volunteers in Burkina Faso.,"Extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) have been described worldwide, but few reports focused on Burkina Faso. To assess the prevalence of digestive carriage of such bacteria in the community and in the hospital, 214 fecal samples, 101 from healthy volunteers and 113 from hospitalized patients without digestive pathology, were collected in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso economic capital, during July and August 2014. Stool samples were screened using ESBL agar plates. Strains were identified by mass spectrometry using the Biotyper MALDI-TOF. ESBL production was confirmed with the double-disc synergy test. Susceptibility was tested using the disk diffusion method on MÃ¼ller-Hinton agar. The main ESBL genes were detected using multiplex PCR and bidirectional gene sequencing. Escherichia coli phylogenetic groups were identified using a PCR-based method. During the study period, prevalence of subjects with fecal ESBL-PE was 32% (69/214), 22% among healthy volunteers and 42% among inpatients. All but two ESBL, CTX-M-15 and ESBL-PE, were mostly E. coli (78%). Among the 60 ESBL-producing E. coli strains, 26% belonged to phylogenetic group D, 23.3% to group A, 20% to group B1, 6.6% to group B2, and 3.3% to the ST131 clone. Univariate analysis showed that history of hospitalization and previous antibiotic use were risk factors associated with ESBL-PE fecal carriage. In Burkina Faso, the prevalence of both healthy subjects from the community and hospitalized patients with fecal ESBL-PE is alarmingly high. This feature should be taken into consideration by both general practitioners and hospital doctors with regard to empirical treatments of infections, notably urinary tract infections.",2017,Microbial drug resistance
Palynology of the dinosaur beds of Tendaguru (Tanzania) â€“ preliminary results,"Abstract. The Tendaguru Beds, southeastern Tanzania, have yielded two palynological assemblages of Kimmeridgian to Tithonian age: (1) the Anapiculatisporites-Densoisporites-Trisaccites assemblage from the Middle Saurian Beds and (2) the Barbatacysta-Pareodinia assemblage from the overlying Smeei Beds. A third assemblage with Rhizophagites and rare angiosperm pollen from the Upper Saurian Beds is contaminated by recent and subrecent material. The Anapiculatisporites-Densoisporites-Trisaccites assemblage is characterized by the presence of freshwater algae ( Ovoidites ), pteridopyhtic-bryophytic spores and gymnosperm (conifer) pollen, with Classopollis as the most abundant element. Among the rare elements of this assemblage is the questionable dinoflagellate Mendicodinium ? quadratum , possibly a Kimmeridgian-Tithonian marker. The miospores show palaeobiogeographic links to Southern Gondwana, especially Madagascar, Australia, Argentina and India. Deposition of this assemblage took place in an aquatic environment with strong palynological influx from a terrestrial source and questionable marine influence. The Barbatacysta-Pareodinia assemblage contains a considerable number of dinoflagellates suggesting deposition in a marine environment. The terrestrially-derived miospores are impoverished and dominated by conifer pollen, while pteridophytic-bryophytic spores form a very subordinate element or are absent. Die Tendaguru-Schichten, Sudost-Tansania, haben zwei palynologische Assoziationen, deren Alter als Kimmeridge bis Tithon interpretiert wird, geliefert. Die Anapiculatisporites-Densoisporites-Trisaccites -Assoziation stammt aus den Mittleren Saurierschichten, und die Barbatacysta-Pareodinia -Assoziation charakterisiert die daruberlagernden Smeei -Schichten. Eine dritte Vergesellschaftung mit Rhizophagites und seltenen Angiospermen-Pollen aus den Oberen Saurierschichten ist durch rezentes bis subrezentes Material kontaminiert. Die Anapiculatisporites-Densoisporites-Trisaccites -Assoziation ist durch die Anwesenheit von Suswasser-Algen ( Ovoidites ), Pteridophyten-Bryophyten-Sporen und Gymnospermen-Pollen (Koniferen) gekennzeichnet mit Classopollis als dem haufigsten Element. Zu den seltenen Elementen dieser Assoziation gehort der fragliche Dinoflagellat Mendicodinium ? quadratum , der moglicherweise als leitend fur das Kimmeridge-Tithon angesehen werden kann. Die Miosporen zeigen palaobiogeographische Verbindungen nach Sudgondwana, besonders nach Madagaskar, Australien, Argentinien und Indien. Das Ablagerungsmilieu dieser Assoziation war aquatisch mit starker Zufuhr von terrigenem Material, wahrend mariner Einflus fraglich ist. Die Dinoflagellaten-fuhrende Barbatacysta-Pareodinia -Assoziation wurde in einem marinen Milieu gebildet, in dem die Zufuhr terrigener Palynomorphe reduziert und im wesentlichen auf Koniferen-Pollen beschrankt war, wahrend Pteridophyten-Bryophyten-Sporen nur sehr untergeordnet vorkommen oder ganz fehlen. doi: 10.1002/mmng.1999.4860020113",1999,Fossil Record
Multi-Locus Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals the Genetic Architecture of Stalk Lodging Resistance-Related Traits in Maize,"Stalk lodging resistance, which is mainly measured by stem diameter (SD), stalk bending strength (SBS), and rind penetrometer resistance (RPR) in maize, seriously affects the yield and quality of maize (Zea mays L.). To dissect its genetic architecture, in this study multi-locus genome-wide association studies for stalk lodging resistance-related traits were conducted in a population of 257 inbred lines, with tropical, subtropical, and temperate backgrounds, genotyped with 48,193 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms. The analyses of phenotypic variations for the above traits in three environments showed high broad-sense heritability (0.679, 0.720, and 0.854, respectively). In total, 423 significant Quantitative Trait Nucleotides (QTNs) were identified by mrMLM, FASTmrEMMA, ISIS EM-BLASSO, and pLARmEB methods to be associated with the above traits. Among these QTNs, 29, 34, and 48 were commonly detected by multiple methods or across multiple environments to be related to SD, SBS, and RPR, respectively. The superior allele analyses in 30 elite lines showed that only eight lines contained more than 50% of the superior alleles, indicating that stalk lodging resistance can be improved by the integration of more superior alleles. Among sixty-three candidate genes of the consistently expressed QTNs, GRMZM5G856734 and GRMZM2G116885, encoding membrane steroid-binding protein 1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1, respectively, possibly inhibit cell elongation and division, which regulates lodging resistance. Our results provide the further understanding of the genetic foundation of maize lodging resistance.",2018,Frontiers in Plant Science
Compressed Sensing for Reconstructing Coherent Multidimensional Spectra.,"We apply two sparse reconstruction techniques, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the sparse exponential mode analysis (SEMA), to two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy. The algorithms are first tested on model data, showing that both are able to reconstruct the spectra using only a fraction of the data required by the traditional Fourier-based estimator. Through the analysis of a sparsely sampled experimental fluorescence detected 2D spectra of LH2 complexes, we conclude that both SEMA and LASSO can be used to significantly reduce the required data, still allowing to reconstruct the multidimensional spectra. Of the two techniques, it is shown that SEMA offers preferable performance, providing more accurate estimation of the spectral line widths and their positions. Furthermore, SEMA allows for off-grid components, enabling the use of a much smaller dictionary than the LASSO, thereby improving both the performance and lowering the computational complexity for reconstructing coherent multidimensional spectra.",2020,The journal of physical chemistry.

"Estudio de factibilidad para la producciÃ³n de leche de Cabra (Capra hircus) en Lasso, Cotopaxi","Goat (Capra hircus) milk is a commodity that has a limited production in Ecuador. This commodity is basic for quality dairy products that have international recognition such as goat cheese. 
This project determines the proper technical methodology to produce high quality goat milk in convenient volumes in Lasso, province of Cotopaxi, Ecuador. It also briefly discusses the beneficial medicinal properties of goat milk 
Furthermore, hybrid goats will be handled, product of the cross between Saanen and French Alpine goats. The project will start with 70 hybrid goats that should produce 2.50 kilograms per day, during a period of time of 150 days. While the project grows and develops, the goats are expected to increase the volume produced in 15% each year as well as raise the number of producing days by 25 extra days each year. 
As well, this project presents a marketing analysis, which determines the supply and demand of goat milk and goat dairy in the Sierra of Ecuador. 
â€¢ In addition, after developing the pertinent financial study, it demonstrates that goat milk production is a viable and profitable project, presenting a PNV of $45,003.17, at a 13.43% referential rate, and the IRR showed 34.69%.

Radiomics Signature on Computed Tomography Imaging: Association With Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients With Gastric Cancer,"Background: To evaluate whether radiomic feature-based computed tomography (CT) imaging signatures allow prediction of lymph node (LN) metastasis in gastric cancer (GC) and to develop a preoperative nomogram for predicting LN status. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed radiomics features of CT images in 1,689 consecutive patients from three cancer centers. The prediction model was developed in the training cohort and validated in internal and external validation cohorts. Lasso regression model was utilized to select features and build radiomics signature. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to develop the model. We integrated the radiomics signature, clinical T and N stage, and other independent clinicopathologic variables, and this was presented as a radiomics nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. Results: The radiomics signature was significantly associated with pathological LN stage in training and validation cohorts. Multivariable logistic analysis found the radiomics signature was an independent predictor of LN metastasis. The nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration. Conclusions: The newly developed radiomic signature was a powerful predictor of LN metastasis and the radiomics nomogram could facilitate the preoperative individualized prediction of LN status.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Disease prediction based on functional connectomes using a scalable and spatially-informed support vector machine,"Substantial evidence indicates that major psychiatric disorders are associated with distributed neural dysconnectivity, leading to a strong interest in using neuroimaging methods to accurately predict disorder status. In this work, we are specifically interested in a multivariate approach that uses features derived from whole-brain resting state functional connectomes. However, functional connectomes reside in a high dimensional space, which complicates model interpretation and introduces numerous statistical and computational challenges. Traditional feature selection techniques are used to reduce data dimensionality, but are blind to the spatial structure of the connectomes. We propose a regularization framework where the 6-D structure of the functional connectome (defined by pairs of points in 3-D space) is explicitly taken into account via the fused Lasso or the GraphNet regularizer. Our method only restricts the loss function to be convex and margin-based, allowing non-differentiable loss functions such as the hinge-loss to be used. Using the fused Lasso or GraphNet regularizer with the hinge-loss leads to a structured sparse support vector machine (SVM) with embedded feature selection. We introduce a novel efficient optimization algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian and the classical alternating direction method, which can solve both fused Lasso and GraphNet regularized SVM with very little modification. We also demonstrate that the inner subproblems of the algorithm can be solved efficiently in analytic form by coupling the variable splitting strategy with a data augmentation scheme. Experiments on simulated data and resting state scans from a large schizophrenia dataset show that our proposed approach can identify predictive regions that are spatially contiguous in the 6-D ""connectome space,"" offering an additional layer of interpretability that could provide new insights about various disease processes.",2014,NeuroImage
Prediction of Quantitative Traits Using Common Genetic Variants: Application to Body Mass Index,"With the success of the genome-wide association studies (GWASs), many candidate loci for complex human diseases have been reported in the GWAS catalog. Recently, many disease prediction models based on penalized regression or statistical learning methods were proposed using candidate causal variants from significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms of GWASs. However, there have been only a few systematic studies comparing existing methods. In this study, we first constructed risk prediction models, such as stepwise linear regression (SLR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Elastic-Net (EN), using a GWAS chip and GWAS catalog. We then compared the prediction accuracy by calculating the mean square error (MSE) value on data from the Korea Association Resource (KARE) with body mass index. Our results show that SLR provides a smaller MSE value than the other methods, while the numbers of selected variables in each model were similar.",2016,Genomics & Informatics
A combination of tumor and molecular markers predicts a poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.,"PURPOSE
Whether patients with stage IA-IIA lung adenocarcinoma require conventional chemotherapy is still a controversy. An ideal metastasis risk prediction model in lung adenocarcinoma is valuable for determining the prognosis and giving timely, individualized treatment.


RESULTS
Analyzing the clinical cases of 153 lung adenocarcinoma patients using an Ï‡2 test, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis, we selected the most valuable factors for determining metastasis and constructed metastasis prediction models. We confirmed the importance of the tumor markers (CEA, NSE) and a molecular marker (CAMKII) as independent prognostic factors in lung adenocarcinoma. The result of a five-year survival status was significantly associated with CAMKII and CEA (P < 0.05). A nomogram was created using CEA, NSE, CYFRA 21-1, and CAMKII to estimate the metastasis probability for individuals, specifically, 78 stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients were used to verify the effectiveness of the nomogram. Using machine learning, LASSO selected the subset of variables that minimized the predictive error of the outcome, including CEA, NSE, CYFRA 21-1, CAMKII, tumor size, histologic type, lymph node status, smoking, and age. A ten-fold cross-validation showed the average accuracy of this model was 86.208%, with an area under the curve of 0.857, a sensitivity value of 0.840, and a specificity value of 0.873.


CONCLUSION
Using both complementary methods, the predictive models illustrated that the combination of tumor markers and a key molecule to predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients in early stages is valuable. The postoperative transfer rate of stage I patients can be effectively predicted by these complementary methods.",2019,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology
Chronic kidney disease definition and classification: no need for a rush to judgment.,"The unified approach to chronic kidney disease (CKD) as per the Kidney Disease Outcomes Initiative (KDOQI) guideline for the definition and classification of kidney disease provided a paradigm shift in the detection, evaluation, and stratification of what was a neglected clinical problem. The guideline, based on the then-available evidence, determined the problems, limitations, and gaps in the knowledge of the proposed approach. Since then, solutions to the identified problems have been sought, resolutions are in place or are forthcoming, and longitudinal and cohort studies have been undertaken to better define the epidemiology of the disease and its prognostic determinants. The guideline also fostered considerable debate on the precision of the glomerular filtration rate equations, the implications of mislabeling cases, and the large estimates of prevalent cases of CKD. Winearls and Glassock now propose a new staging of CKD, centered on its progression to end-stage renal disease. A systematic analysis of the data accrued, since the publication of the original guideline in 2002, is necessary for the consideration of any refinement or redesign of the current staging. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) has undertaken that initiative. There is no need for a rush to judgment.",2009,Kidney international
Multimodel inference for biomarker development: an application to schizophrenia,"In the present study, to improve the predictive performance of a model and its reproducibility when applied to an independent data set, we investigated the use of multimodel inference to predict the probability of having a complex psychiatric disorder. We formed training and test sets using proteomic data (147 peptides from 77 proteins) from two-independent collections of first-onset drug-naive schizophrenia patients and controls. A set of prediction models was produced by applying lasso regression with repeated tenfold cross-validation to the training set. We used feature extraction and model averaging across the set of models to form two prediction models. The resulting models clearly demonstrated the utility of a multimodel based approach to make good (training set AUCâ€‰>â€‰0.80) and reproducible predictions (test set AUCâ€‰>â€‰0.80) for the probability of having schizophrenia. Moreover, we identified four proteins (five peptides) whose effect on the probability of having schizophrenia was modified by sex, one of which was a novel potential biomarker of schizophrenia, foetal haemoglobin. The evidence of effect modification suggests that future schizophrenia studies should be conducted in males and females separately. Future biomarker studies should consider adopting a multimodel approach and going beyond the main effects of features.",2019,Translational Psychiatry
Robust group fused lasso for multisample copy number variation detection under uncertainty.,"One of the most important needs in the post-genome era is providing the researchers with reliable and efficient computational tools to extract and analyse this huge amount of biological data, in which DNA copy number variation (CNV) is a vitally important one. Array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) is a common approach in order to detect CNVs. Most of methods for this purpose were proposed for one-dimensional profiles. However, slightly this focus has moved from one- to multi-dimensional signals. In addition, since contamination of these profiles with noise is always an issue, it is highly important to have a robust method for analysing multi-sample aCGH profiles. In this study, the authors propose robust group fused lasso which utilises the robust group total variations. Instead of l2,1 norm, the l1 - l2 M-estimator is used which is more robust in dealing with non-Gaussian noise and high corruption. More importantly, Correntropy (Welsch M-estimator) is also applied for fitting error. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the art algorithms and techniques under a wide range of scenarios with diverse noises.",2016,IET systems biology
CGMM LASSO-type estimator for the process of Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck type,"Abstract In this paper, we study the LASSO-type penalized CGMM (GMM with continuum of moment method) estimator for the process of Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck type. This LASSO-type estimator is obtained by minimizing the summation of the CGMM object function and a LASSO-type penalty, which is included for model selection. In the proposed method, model selection and estimation are done simultaneously. Under some regularity conditions, the proposed estimator asymptotically follows a non-standard normal distribution (Caner, 2009). Simulation study shows that the proposed estimator correctly selects the true model much more frequently than the commonly used Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).",2016,Journal of The Korean Statistical Society
Statistical models are able to predict ionic liquid viscosity across a wide range of chemical functionalities and experimental conditions,"Herein we present a method of developing predictive models of viscosity for ionic liquids (ILs) using publicly available data in the ILThermo database and the open-source software toolkits PyChem, RDKit, and SciKit-Learn. The process consists of downloading âˆ¼700 datapoints from ILThermo, generating âˆ¼1200 physiochemical features with PyChem and RDKit, selecting 11 features with the least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) method, and using the selected features to train a multi-layer perceptron regressorâ€”a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). The interpretability of the LASSO model allows a physical interpretation of the model development framework while the flexibility and non-linearity of the hidden layer of the ANN optimizes performance. The method is tested on a range of temperatures, pressures, and viscosities to evaluate its efficacy in a general-purpose setting. The model was trained on 578 datapoints including a temperature range of 273.15â€“373.15 K, pressure range of 60â€“160 kPa, viscosity range of 0.0035â€“0.993 Pa s, and ILs of imidazolium, phosphonium, pyridinium, and pyrrolidinium classes to give 33 different salts altogether. The model had a validation set mean squared error of 4.7 Ã— 10âˆ’4 Â± 2.4 Ã— 10âˆ’5 Pa s or relative absolute average deviation of 7.1 Â± 1.3%.",2018,
Sampling Constrained Probability Distributions Using Spherical Augmentation,"Statistical models with constrained probability distributions are abundant in machine learning. Some examples include regression models with norm constraints (e.g., Lasso), probit, many copula models, and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Bayesian inference involving probability distributions confined to constrained domains could be quite challenging for commonly used sampling algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel augmentation technique that handles a wide range of constraints by mapping the constrained domain to a sphere in the augmented space. By moving freely on the surface of this sphere, sampling algorithms handle constraints implicitly and generate proposals that remain within boundaries when mapped back to the original space. Our proposed method, called Spherical Augmentation, provides a mathematically natural and computationally efficient framework for sampling from constrained probability distributions . We show the advantages of our method over state-of-the-art sampling algorithms, such as exact Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, using several examples including truncated Gaussian distributions, Bayesian Lasso, Bayesian bridge regression, reconstruction of quantized stationary Gaussian process, and LDA for topic modeling.",2016,arXiv: Computation

Non-penalty shrinkage estimation of random effect models for longitudinal data with AR(1) errors,"Abstract In this paper, we consider the non-penalty shrinkage estimation method of random effect models with autoregressive errors for longitudinal data when there are many covariates and some of them may not be active for the response variable. In observational studies, subjects are followed over equally or unequally spaced visits to determine the continuous response and whether the response is associated with the risk factors/covariates. Measurements from the same subject are usually more similar to each other and thus are correlated with each other but not with observations of other subjects. To analyse this data, we consider a linear model that contains both random effects across subjects and within-subject errors that follows autoregressive structure of order 1 (AR(1)). Considering the subject-specific random effect as a nuisance parameter, we use two competing models, one includes all the covariates and the other restricts the coefficients based on the auxiliary information. We consider the non-penalty shrinkage estimation strategy that shrinks the unrestricted estimator in the direction of the restricted estimator. We discuss the asymptotic properties of the shrinkage estimators using the notion of asymptotic biases and risks. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to examine the relative performance of the shrinkage estimators with the unrestricted estimator when the shrinkage dimension exceeds two. We also numerically compare the performance of the shrinkage estimators to that of the LASSO estimator. A longitudinal CD4 cell count data set will be used to illustrate the usefulness of shrinkage and LASSO estimators.",2018,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
Manifold Learning for Human Population Structure Studies,"The dimension of the population genetics data produced by next-generation sequencing platforms is extremely high. However, the ""intrinsic dimensionality"" of sequence data, which determines the structure of populations, is much lower. This motivates us to use locally linear embedding (LLE) which projects high dimensional genomic data into low dimensional, neighborhood preserving embedding, as a general framework for population structure and historical inference. To facilitate application of the LLE to population genetic analysis, we systematically investigate several important properties of the LLE and reveal the connection between the LLE and principal component analysis (PCA). Identifying a set of markers and genomic regions which could be used for population structure analysis will provide invaluable information for population genetics and association studies. In addition to identifying the LLE-correlated or PCA-correlated structure informative marker, we have developed a new statistic that integrates genomic information content in a genomic region for collectively studying its association with the population structure and LASSO algorithm to search such regions across the genomes. We applied the developed methodologies to a low coverage pilot dataset in the 1000 Genomes Project and a PHASE III Mexico dataset of the HapMap. We observed that 25.1%, 44.9% and 21.4% of the common variants and 89.2%, 92.4% and 75.1% of the rare variants were the LLE-correlated markers in CEU, YRI and ASI, respectively. This showed that rare variants, which are often private to specific populations, have much higher power to identify population substructure than common variants. The preliminary results demonstrated that next generation sequencing offers a rich resources and LLE provide a powerful tool for population structure analysis.",2012,PLoS ONE

Adaptive Lasso Logistic Regression Applied on Gene Expression of Prostate Cancer,"Introduction: The high number of prostate cancer patients has signified the importance of identifying its risk factors. The aim of the present study was to employ stratification method and penalized logistic regression with the adaptive LASSO for selecting appropriate and important genes in prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: Microarray data used in this study include a prostate cancer gene expression dataset with [HG_U95B] Affymetrix Human Genome U95B Array platform which consisted of 12,620 genes and 167 subjects, among whom 76 subjects were unaffected and the rest were affected with cancer. Using adaptive Lasso regression, important genes in prostate cancer were stratified and the results were analyzed using ROC analysis and gene ontology annotation. To modify and conduct primary measures on the dataset, SPSS software version 22 was used. To fit the models and draw the diagrams, R software version 3.3.1 and penalty specific packages were used. Findings: According to this research, the obtained adaptive Lasso regression accuracy and confidence interval (CI) were 0.99 and 0.97-0.99, respectively. Considering criteria such as area under the curve and gene ontology annotation, it can be argued that adaptive Lasso regression was fairly effective in stratification and selection of appropriate genes in prostate cancer. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it can be said that in gene expression data, where there are both linear and large scale data, techniques such as adaptive Lasso can be useful in diagnosis of effective genes.",2017,
Untargeted Profiling of Concordant/Discordant Phenotypes of High Insulin Resistance and Obesity To Predict the Risk of Developing Diabetes.,"This study explores the metabolic profiles of concordant/discordant phenotypes of high insulin resistance (IR) and obesity. Through untargeted metabolomics (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS), we analyzed the fasting serum of subjects with high IR and/or obesity ( n = 64). An partial least-squares discriminant analysis with orthogonal signal correction followed by univariate statistics and enrichment analysis allowed exploration of these metabolic profiles. A multivariate regression method (LASSO) was used for variable selection and a predictive biomarker model to identify subjects with high IR regardless of obesity was built. Adrenic acid and a dyglyceride (DG) were shared by high IR and obesity. Uric and margaric acids, 14 DGs, ketocholesterol, and hydroxycorticosterone were unique to high IR, while arachidonic, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (HETE), palmitoleic, triHETE, and glycocholic acids, HETE lactone, leukotriene B4, and two glutamyl-peptides to obesity. DGs and adrenic acid differed in concordant/discordant phenotypes, thereby revealing protective mechanisms against high IR also in obesity. A biomarker model formed by DGs, uric and adrenic acids presented a high predictive power to identify subjects with high IR [AUC 80.1% (68.9-91.4)]. These findings could become relevant for diabetes risk detection and unveil new potential targets in therapeutic treatments of IR, diabetes, and obesity. An independent validated cohort is needed to confirm these results.",2018,Journal of proteome research

Radiomics in predicting tumor molecular marker P63 for non-small cell lung cancer.,"OBJECTIVE
To establish a radiomics signature based on CT images of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to predict the expression of molecular marker P63.â€© Methods: A total of 245 NSCLC patients who underwent CT scans were retrospectively included. All patients were confirmed by histopathological examinations and P63 expression were examined within 2 weeks after CT examination. Radiomics features were extracted by MaZda software and subjective image features were defined from original non-enhanced CT images. The Lasso-logistic regression model was used to select features and develop radiomics signature, subjective image features model, and combined diagnostic model. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and compared with Delong test.â€© Results: Of the 245 patients, 96 were P63 positive and 149 were P63 negative. The subjective image feature model consisted of 6 image features. Through feature selection, the radiomics signature consisted of 8 radiomics features. The area under the ROC curves of the subjective image feature model and the radiomics signature in predicting P63 expression statue were 0.700 and 0.755, respectively, without a significant difference (P>0.05). The combined diagnostic model showed the best predictive power (AUC=0.817, P<0.01).â€© Conclusion: The radiomics-based CT scan images can predict the expression status of NSCLC molecular marker P63. The combination of the radiomics features and subjective image features can significantly improve the predictive performance of the predictive model, which may be helpful to provide a non-invasive way for understanding the molecular information for lung cancer cells.",2019,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Statistical Estimation of Correlated Genome Associations to a Quantitative Trait Network,"Many complex disease syndromes, such as asthma, consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical or molecular phenotypes. This raises a new technical challenge in identifying genetic variations associated simultaneously with correlated traits. In this study, we propose a new statistical framework called graph-guided fused lasso (GFlasso) to directly and effectively incorporate the correlation structure of multiple quantitative traits such as clinical metrics and gene expressions in association analysis. Our approach represents correlation information explicitly among the quantitative traits as a quantitative trait network (QTN) and then leverages this network to encode structured regularization functions in a multivariate regression model over the genotypes and traits. The result is that the genetic markers that jointly influence subgroups of highly correlated traits can be detected jointly with high sensitivity and specificity. While most of the traditional methods examined each phenotype independently and combined the results afterwards, our approach analyzes all of the traits jointly in a single statistical framework. This allows our method to borrow information across correlated phenotypes to discover the genetic markers that perturb a subset of the correlated traits synergistically. Using simulated datasets based on the HapMap consortium and an asthma dataset, we compared the performance of our method with other methods based on single-marker analysis and regression-based methods that do not use any of the relational information in the traits. We found that our method showed an increased power in detecting causal variants affecting correlated traits. Our results showed that, when correlation patterns among traits in a QTN are considered explicitly and directly during a structured multivariate genome association analysis using our proposed methods, the power of detecting true causal SNPs with possibly pleiotropic effects increased significantly without compromising performance on non-pleiotropic SNPs.",2009,PLoS Genetics
Exploiting feature relationships towards stable feature selection,"Feature selection is an important step in building predictive models for most real-world problems. One of the popular methods in feature selection is Lasso. However, it shows instability in selecting features when dealing with correlated features. In this work, we propose a new method that aims to increase the stability of Lasso by encouraging similarities between features based on their relatedness, which is captured via a feature covariance matrix. Besides modeling positive feature correlations, our method can also identify negative correlations between features. We propose a convex formulation for our model along with an alternating optimization algorithm that can learn the weights of the features as well as the relationship between them. Using both synthetic and real-world data, we show that the proposed method is more stable than Lasso and many state-of-the-art shrinkage and feature selection methods. Also, its predictive performance is comparable to other methods.",2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)
Determination of vector error correction models in high dimensions,"We provide a shrinkage type methodology which allows for simultaneous model selection and estimation of vector error correction models (VECM) when the dimension is large and can increase with sample size. Model determination is treated as a joint selection problem of cointegrating rank and autoregressive lags under respective practically valid sparsity assumptions. We show consistency of the selection mechanism by the resulting Lasso-VECM estimator under very general assumptions on dimension, rank and error terms. Moreover, with computational complexity of a linear programming problem only, the procedure remains computationally tractable in high dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by a simulation study and an empirical application to recent CDS data after the financial crisis.",2019,Journal of Econometrics

A Sticky Weighted Regression Model for Time-Varying Resting-State Brain Connectivity Estimation,"Despite recent progress on brain connectivity modeling using neuroimaging data such as fMRI, most current approaches assume that brain connectivity networks have time-invariant topology/coefficients. This is clearly problematic as the brain is inherently nonstationary. Here, we present a time-varying model to investigate the temporal dynamics of brain connectivity networks. The proposed method allows for abrupt changes in network structure via a fused least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) scheme, as well as recovery of time-varying networks with smoothly changing coefficients via a weighted regression technique. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method yields improved accuracy on estimating time-dependent connectivity patterns when compared to a static sparse regression model or a weighted time-varying regression model. When applied to real resting-state fMRI datasets from Parkinson's disease (PD) and control subjects, significantly different temporal and spatial patterns were found to be associated with PD. Specifically, PD subjects demonstrated reduced network variability over time, which may be related to impaired cognitive flexibility previously reported in PD. The temporal dynamic properties of brain connectivity in PD subjects may provide insights into brain dynamics associated with PD and may serve as a potential biomarker in future studies.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering

"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) induces gonad reversal in the protogynous bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum (Teleostei: Labridae).","Female-to-male sex transformation in the protogynous marine fish Thalassoma bifasciatum is the culmination of a neuroendocrine cascade triggered by social and behavioral cues. We have previously shown that the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, key components of the neuroendocrine axis, play a significant role in gender reversal of this species. However, nothing is known about the possible involvement of other brain factors with the hypothalamo-pituitary gland axis in this fish. One such factor, neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been shown to effect a direct or indirect control of GtH-II release in gonochoristic teleosts. In view of this finding, we have investigated the role of NPY on sex reversal in T. bifasciatum. Females (n = 38) were injected intraperitoneally thrice weekly with NPY at a dose of 0.02 microgram/gbw dissolved in 0.6% saline. Controls (n = 48) received equal volumes of saline. Fish were sacrificed at 1, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. By the end of 8 weeks, 81.6% of the NPY-treated fish showed signs of gonad reversal ranging from early (n = 25) to mid- (n = 3) and late stage (n = 3). Furthermore, the effects of NPY appeared to be dependent on duration of treatment. At 6 and 8 weeks, the ovaries of four and three fish, respectively, were markedly degenerated. Our findings shed new light on the neuroendocrine control of sex reversal in T. bifasciatum and in hermaphroditic forms in general.",1997,The Journal of experimental zoology
Structured penalized regression for drug sensitivity prediction.,"Large-scale {\it in vitro} drug sensitivity screens are an important tool in personalized oncology to predict the effectiveness of potential cancer drugs. The prediction of the sensitivity of cancer cell lines to a panel of drugs is a multivariate regression problem with high-dimensional heterogeneous multi-omics data as input data and with potentially strong correlations between the outcome variables which represent the sensitivity to the different drugs. We propose a joint penalized regression approach with structured penalty terms which allow us to utilize the correlation structure between drugs with group-lasso-type penalties and at the same time address the heterogeneity between omics data sources by introducing data-source-specific penalty factors to penalize different data sources differently. By combining integrative penalty factors (IPF) with tree-guided group lasso, we create the IPF-tree-lasso method. We present a unified framework to transform more general IPF-type methods to the original penalized method. Because the structured penalty terms have multiple parameters, we demonstrate how the interval-search Efficient Parameter Selection via Global Optimization (EPSGO) algorithm can be used to optimize multiple penalty parameters efficiently. Simulation studies show that IPF-tree-lasso can improve the prediction performance compared to other lasso-type methods, in particular for heterogenous data sources. Finally, we employ the new methods to analyse data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer project.",2020,arXiv: Methodology
Influencers and Communities in Social Networks,"Integration of social media characteristics into an econometric framework requires modeling a high dimensional dynamic network with dimensions of parameter Î˜ typically much larger than the number of observations. To cope with this problem we introduce a new structural model which supposes that the network is driven by influencers. We additionally assume the community structure of the network, such that the users from the same community depend on the same influencers. An estimation procedure is proposed based on a greedy algorithm and LASSO. Through theoretical study and simulations, we show that the matrix parameter can be estimated even when the observed time interval is smaller than the size of the network. Using a novel dataset of 1069K messages from 30K users posted on the microblogging platform StockTwits during a 4-year period (01.201412.2018) and quantifying their opinions via natural language processing, we model their dynamic opinions network and further separate the network into communities.

Carbon stocks and accumulation rates in Red Sea seagrass meadows,"Seagrasses play an important role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, acting as natural CO2 sinks and buffering the impacts of rising sea level. However, global estimates of organic carbon (Corg) stocks, accumulation rates and seafloor elevation rates in seagrasses are limited to a few regions, thus potentially biasing global estimates. Here we assessed the extent of soil Corg stocks and accumulation rates in seagrass meadows (Thalassia hemprichii, Enhalus acoroides, Halophila stipulacea, Thalassodendrum ciliatum and Halodule uninervis) from Saudi Arabia. We estimated that seagrasses store 3.4â€‰Â±â€‰0.3â€‰kg Corg mâˆ’2 in 1â€‰m-thick soil deposits, accumulated at 6.8â€‰Â±â€‰1.7â€‰g Corg mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1 over the last 500 to 2,000 years. The extreme conditions in the Red Sea, such as nutrient limitation reducing seagrass growth rates and high temperature increasing soil respiration rates, may explain their relative low Corg storage compared to temperate meadows. Differences in soil Corg storage among habitats (i.e. location and species composition) are mainly related to the contribution of seagrass detritus to the soil Corg pool, fluxes of Corg from adjacent mangrove and tidal marsh ecosystems into seagrass meadows, and the amount of fine sediment particles. Seagrasses sequester annually around 0.8% of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuels by Saudi Arabia, while buffering the impacts of sea level rise. This study contributes data from understudied regions to a growing dataset on seagrass carbon stocks and sequestration rates and further evidences that even small seagrass species store Corg in coastal areas.",2018,Scientific Reports
â€œOff to Northern Ghana in the Morningâ€: Ramifications of a Trip,"Boko Haram terror activities in northeastern Nigeria that have unleashed economic hardships and political insecurity on the people have been a subject of concern, not only locally but to governments of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

Growth- and size-selective mortality in pelagic larvae of a common reef fish,"Larvae of most aquatic species experience high mortality in the plankton and where traits are naturally variable, mortality can be selective. We tested the hypothesis that reef fish lar- vae with faster growth rates and larger size-at-age will be more likely to survive the pelagic larval period. We examined the otolith microstructure of larval bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum collected across the Straits of Florida to obtain daily growth rates and relative size-at-age. Using a cross-sectional approach, we compared these traits between 2 larval age groups (young larvae: 18 to 26 d old, survivors: 27 to 36 d old) to determine whether mean traits varied with age. In contrast to expectations, survivors had slower early growth and were smaller-at-age than the young lar- vae, suggesting that faster growing, larger individuals were selectively removed from the popula- tion over time. To examine the role of water masses, we estimated maximum upstream larval posi- tions. Differential current speeds across the Straits of Florida resulted in substantial overlap in back-estimated upstream locations of larvae at younger ages, suggesting that differences in early growth environments were unlikely the cause of the observed patterns. Instead, the most parsimo- nious explanation is the selective loss of fast-growing, large-at-age larvae in the plankton. Shifts in the direction of selective pressures across stages may contribute to the maintenance of high plasticity in the early life history traits of this species.",2011,Aquatic Biology
Making the Most of Bag of Words: Sentence Regularization with Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers,"In many high-dimensional learning problems, only some parts of an observation are important to the prediction task; for example, the cues to correctly categorizing a document may lie in a handful of its sentences. We introduce a learning algorithm that exploits this intuition by encoding it in a regularizer. Specifically, we apply the sparse overlapping group lasso with one group for every bundle of features occurring together in a training-data sentence, leading to thousands to millions of overlapping groups. We show how to efficiently solve the resulting optimization challenge using the alternating directions method of multipliers. We find that the resulting method significantly outperforms competitive baselines (standard ridge, lasso, and elastic net regularizers) on a suite of real-world text categorization problems.",2014,
An â„“1-regularized least-squares deblurring algorithm with an application to GPR imaging,"The delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm is widely used to reconstruct ground penetrating radar (GPR) images because of its simplicity and speed. However the drawback of the DAS algorithm is that it produces images with poor resolution and significant sidelobes. In this paper, we present a method that deblurs the DAS image using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) without incurring the high computation cost associated with conventional LASSO. In a limited study using simulated data, the proposed deblurring algorithm produces images that are sparse with significantly reduced sidelobes.",2017,"2017 IEEE 8th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)"
w-Regular languages are testable with a constant number of queries,"We continue the study of combinatorial property testing. For a property Ïˆ, an e-test for Ïˆ, for 0 0, we describe an algorithm that gets as input an infinite lasso-shape word of the form x Ä‹ yÏ‰, for finite words x and y, samples only a constant number of letters in x and y, returns ""yes"" if w âˆˆ L(A), and returns ""no"" with probability 2/3 if w is e-far from L(A). We also discuss the applicability of property testing to formal verification, where Ï‰-regular languages are used for the specification of the behavior of nonterminating reactive systems, and computations correspond to lasso-shape words.",2004,Theor.

"Algoriphagus hitonicola sp. nov., isolated from an athalassohaline lagoon.","A Gram-negative, heterotrophic, aerobic, reddish-orange-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile bacterial strain, designated 7-UAH(T), was isolated from salty water from the athalassohaline lagoon at El Hito, located in central Spain. The strain grew optimally at 37 degrees C and pH 7.0 and in the presence of 2.5 % NaCl. A polyphasic taxonomic study was carried out in order to characterize the strain in detail. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicated that strain 7-UAH(T) clustered within the branch constituted by species of the genus Hongiella, which were recently transferred to the genus Algoriphagus. Analysis of the polar lipid profile and DNA G+C content also supported placement of strain 7-UAH(T) within the genus Algoriphagus. On the basis of its phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic distinctiveness, strain 7-UAH(T) represents a novel species of the genus Algoriphagus, for which the name Algoriphagus hitonicola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 7-UAH(T) (=CECT 7267(T) =CCM 7449(T)).",2008,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Sampling Requirements for Stable Autoregressive Estimation,"We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a linear univariate autoregressive (AR) model with sub-Gaussian innovations from a limited sequence of consecutive observations. Assuming that the parameters are compressible, we analyze the performance of the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _1$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-regularized least squares as well as a greedy estimator of the parameters and characterize the sampling tradeoffs required for stable recovery in the nonasymptotic regime. In particular, we show that for a fixed sparsity level, stable recovery of AR parameters is possible when the number of samples scale <italic>sublinearly </italic> with the AR order. Our results improve over existing sampling complexity requirements in AR estimation using the Lasso, when the sparsity level scales faster than the square root of the model order. We further derive sufficient conditions on the sparsity level that guarantee the minimax optimality of the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _1$</tex-math></inline-formula>-regularized least squares estimate. Applying these techniques to simulated data as well as real-world datasets from crude oil prices and traffic speed data confirm our predicted theoretical performance gains in terms of estimation accuracy and model selection.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
