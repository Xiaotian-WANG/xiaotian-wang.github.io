LASSO with Non-linear Measurements is Equivalent to One With Linear Measurements,"Consider estimating an unknown, but structured (e.g. sparse, low-rank, etc.), signal x0 âˆˆ â„n from a vector y âˆˆ â„m of measurements of the form yi = gi(aiT x0), where the ai's are the rows of a known measurement matrix A, and, g(Â·) is a (potentially unknown) nonlinear and random link-function. Such measurement functions could arise in applications where the measurement device has nonlinearities and uncertainties. It could also arise by design, e.g., gi (x) = sign(x + zi), corresponds to noisy 1-bit quantized measurements. Motivated by the classical work of Brillinger, and more recent work of Plan and Vershynin, we estimate x0 via solving the Generalized-LASSO, i.e., x^ := arg minx â€–y - Ax0â€–2 + Î»f(x) for some regularization parameter Î» > 0 and some (typically non-smooth) convex regularizer f(Â·) that promotes the structure of x0, e.g. l1-norm, nuclear-norm, etc. While this approach seems to naively ignore the nonlinear function g(Â·), both Brillinger (in the non-constrained case) and Plan and Vershynin have shown that, when the entries of A are iid standard normal, this is a good estimator of x0 up to a constant of proportionality Î¼, which only depends on g(Â·). In this work, we considerably strengthen these results by obtaining explicit expressions forâ€–x^â€”Î¼x0â€–2, for the regularized Generalized-LASSO, that are asymptotically precise when m and n grow large. A main result is that the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO with non-linear measurements is asymptotically the same as one whose measurements are linear yi = Î¼aiTx0 + Ïƒzi, with Î¼ = EÎ³g(Î³) and Ïƒ2 = E(g(Î³) - Î¼Î³)2, and, Î³ standard normal. To the best of our knowledge, the derived expressions on the estimation performance are the first-known precise results in this context. One interesting consequence of our result is that the optimal quantizer of the measurements that minimizes the estimation error of the Generalized LASSO is the celebrated Lloyd-Max quantizer.",2015,ArXiv
Radiofrequency ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with the new irrigated multipolar nMARQ ablation catheter: verification of intracardiac signals with a second circular mapping catheter.,"BACKGROUND
During radiofrequency (RF) ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a circular multielectrode recording ""lasso"" catheter is generally positioned within each pulmonary vein (PV) to determine when pulmonary vein potentials (PVPs) are present and when they have been ablated. The new irrigated multipolar nMARQ circular ablation catheter is positioned within the left atrium to create contiguous circular ablation lines around each PV ostium.


OBJECTIVE
To determine whether the recordings obtained from the nMARQ catheter position around the PV ostium accurately reproduce the recordings obtained from a lasso catheter positioned within that vein.


METHODS
In 10 patients undergoing RF ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, we placed an nMARQ and a lasso catheter around and within each PV, respectively. Recordings obtained from both catheters at baseline and after RF ablation were compared.


RESULTS
At baseline, recordings of PVPs in both catheters were concordant in 92% of all PVs. However, after RF delivery, the concordance between the nMARQ and lasso recordings was poor. The discordant result most commonly observed was disappearance of ""PVPs"" from the nMARQ catheter with persistence of PVPs in the lasso catheter (12 of 39 [30%]). Conversely, the delivery of RF frequently resulted in fragmented electrograms (pseudo-PVPs) on the nMARQ catheter despite evidence of PV isolation by lasso catheter recordings.


CONCLUSIONS
The use of an nMARQ catheter alone, as currently recommended, may lead to underestimation and overestimation of the number of RF applications required to achieve PV isolation.",2014,Heart rhythm
Smart digital loudspeaker arrays,"0INTRODUCTIONThis paper considers from a theoretical stance the fun-damental requirements of a programmable polar response,digital loudspeaker array, or smart digital loudspeakerarray (SDLA), which consists of either one-dimensionalor a two-dimensional array of micro radiating elements.The principal problem addressed here is the design of a setof digital filters which together with a uniform array ofsmall drive units, achieve a well-defined directional beamthat can both be steered over a 180Â° arc and be specifiedin terms of beamwidth such that it remains constant withthe steering angle. Intrinsic and critical to the SDLA is therequirement that the beam parameters remain stable overa broad frequency range. In addition to addressing theproblem of coherent radiation, the theory is extended toinclude the synthesis of directionally controllable diffuseradiation that is similar although not identical to the classof sound field produced by a distributed-mode loud-speaker (DML) [1], [2]. DML behavior can be emulatedusing an array of discrete radiating elements with excita-tion signals calculated to model panel surface wave prop-agation and boundary reflections using techniques such asfinite element vibration analysis [3]. However, for theSDLA a different approach is taken where each elementdrive signal is derived by convolution of the input signalwith an element-specific but stochastically independenttemporally diffuse impulse response (TDI) [4]. Each TDIis calculated to have a constant-magnitude response but aunique random-phase response, where for loudspeakerapplications it is formed asymmetrically to have a rapidinitial response and a decaying â€œtailâ€ exhibiting a noise-like character.The conceptual structure of an SDLA is shown in Fig.1, where each mircodriver within the array is addresseddirectly by a digital signal that has been filtered adaptivelyto allow the polar response to be specified and controlleddynamically. It is proposed to configure the transducerarray with a large number of nominally identical acousticradiating elements, where the overall array size andinterelement spacing (referred to here as interspacing)",2003,Journal of The Audio Engineering Society
A Machine Learning-based Recommendation System for Swaptions Strategies,"Derivative traders are usually required to scan through hundreds, even thousands of possible trades on a daily basis. Up to now, not a single solution is available to aid in their job. Hence, this work aims to develop a trading recommendation system, and apply this system to the so-called Mid-Curve Calendar Spread (MCCS), an exotic swaption-based derivatives package. In summary, our trading recommendation system follows this pipeline: (i) on a certain trade date, we compute metrics and sensitivities related to an MCCS; (ii) these metrics are feed in a model that can predict its expected return for a given holding period; and after repeating (i) and (ii) for all trades we (iii) rank the trades using some dominance criteria. To suggest that such approach is feasible, we used a list of 35 different types of MCCS; a total of 11 predictive models; and 4 benchmark models. Our results suggest that in general linear regression with lasso regularisation compared favourably to other approaches from a predictive and interpretability perspective.",2018,ArXiv
An algorithm for the multivariate group lasso with covariance estimation,"ABSTRACT We study a group lasso estimator for the multivariate linear regression model that accounts for correlated error terms. A block coordinate descent algorithm is used to compute this estimator. We perform a simulation study with categorical data and multivariate time series data, typical settings with a natural grouping among the predictor variables. Our simulation studies show the good performance of the proposed group lasso estimator compared to alternative estimators. We illustrate the method on a time series data set of gene expressions.",2015,Journal of Applied Statistics
A BCHC genetic algorithm model of cotemporal hierarchical Arabidopsis thaliana gene interactions,"Gene interaction network models from time course gene transcript abundance data are algorithmically created using a new aggressive genetic algorithm denoted by BCHC. The BCHC algorithm rigorously integrates probabilistic hierarchical likelihood and Bayesian methodology to produce accurate posterior probabilities of interactions between genes after observance of hierarchical gene transcript abundance data. Forbidden pairwise gene relationships are incorporated into the modeling process. This gene interaction model is compared to a previous gene interaction model utilizing the same data and Bayesian likelihood, however based upon an exponentially slower, less aggressive, and less adaptive Metropolis-Hasting search algorithm. In addition for a smaller data set, our gene interaction model is compared to less rigorous non-probabilistic Lasso estimated partial correlation models which do not fully incorporate the hierarchical structure. A comparison is also made between the smallest Bayesian model and tests for edges based on a restricted non-Bayesian hierarchical technique. The BCHC algorithm performs well when the number of genes is moderately increased, both in terms of execution time and model quality.",2018,2018 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)
"Morphometric Characteristics And Quality Of Artemia sp. Cysts (Crustacea: Anostraca), Living In Sulphated Waters In Coahijila, Mexico","En el presente trabajo se da a conocer una nueva poblacion de Artemia en la Republica Mexicana, localizada en un ecosistema de aguas atalasohalinas, ricas en iones de sulfato, magnesio y sodio. La zona de Cuatro Cienegas en el estado de Coahuila ha sido estudiada ampliamente; sin embargo, son escasos los trabajos sobre las poblaciones de Artemia de la zona. La recoleccion de los quistes de Artemia se realizo en los estanques rusticos de la salina Casa Blanca. Los estudios de biometria de los quistes, nauplios y adultos y la calidad de eclosion de los quistes se llevaron a cabo en condiciones de laboratorio. Los resultados obtenidos se compararon con los datos de otras poblaciones de aguas interiores y con la poblacion de la Bahia de San Francisco, California, EUA, que fue considerada como referencia de la especie Artemia franciscana. Los quistes de Cuatro Cienegas son los mas pequenos de las variedades de Artemia de aguas interiores en Mexico hasta ahora descritos. Las medidas de los quistes hidratados (230.8 Â± 20.54 um) y descapsulados (221.0 Â± 33.56 um) y de los nauplios (479.71Â± 54.54 um) muestran que pertenecen al intervalo establecido para la especie A. franciscana (237 k 14.60 um, 212. Â± 11.30 um y 431 Â±. 23.7 pm, respectivamente). La talla que alcanza el adulto de la poblacion de Coahuila es pequeiia; las hembras son mas grandes que los machos (6.94 Â± 1.19 mm y 6.35 Â± 0.47 mm) y, aunque esta talla se sale de la establecida para la especie A. franciscana (10.25 Â± 0.89 mm y 7.08 Â± 0.37 mm), hay que considerar que el medio ambiente influye en el tamaiio de los adultos.

The present work deals with a new population of Artemia in the Mexican Republic, located in an ecosystem of athalassohaline waters, rich in sulphate, magnesium and sodium ions. The zone of Cuatro Cienegas in the state of Coahuila has been widely studied; however, studies on the populations of Artemia in this zone are scarce. Artemia cysts were collected from the rustic reservoirs of the Casa Blanca saltworks. The studies of the biometry of cysts, nauplii and adults and the hatch quality of the cysts were carried out under laboratory conditions. The results obtained were compared with data of other populations of interior waters and with the population of San Francisco Bay, California, USA, that has been used as referente of the Artemia franciscana species. The cysts of Cuatro Cienegas are the smallest of the varieties of Artemia of interior waters in Mexico described to date. The measurements of the hydrated cysts (230.8 Â± 20.54 Pm), the decapsulated cysts (221.0 Â± 33.56 pm) and the nauplii (479.71 Â± 54.54 um) show that they belong in the range established for the A. franciscana species (237 Â± 14.60 um; 212.1 Â± 11.30 pm and 431 Â± 23.7 um, respectively). The size of the adults of the Coahuila population is small; the females are larger than the males (6.94 Â± 1.19 mm and 6.35 Â± 0.47 mm) and, though these sizes are bigger than the ones established for the A. franciscana species (10.25 Â± 0.89 mm and 7.08 Â± 0.37 mm), one must consider that the environment influences the size of the adults.

Characterization of a five-microRNA signature as a prognostic biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"This study aims to identify a miRNAs signature for predicting overall survival (OS) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients. MiRNA expression profiles and corresponding clinical information of 119 ESCC patients were obtained from NCBI GEO and used as the training set. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were screened between early-stage and late-stage samples. Cox regression analysis, recursive feature elimination (RFE)-support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, and LASSO Cox regression model were used to identify prognostic miRNAs and consequently build a prognostic scoring model. Moreover, promising target genes of these prognostic miRNAs were predicted followed by construction of miRNA-target gene networks. Functional relevance of predicted target genes of these prognostic miRNAs in ESCC was analyzed by performing function enrichment analyses. There were 46 DEmiRNAs between early-stage and late-stage samples in the training set. A risk score model based on five miRNAs was built. The five-miRNA risk score could classify the training set into a high-risk group and a low-risk group with significantly different OS time. Risk stratification ability of the five-miRNA risk score was successfully validated on an independent set from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Various biological processes and pathways were identified to be related to these miRNAs, such as Wnt signaling pathway, inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels pathway, and estrogen signaling pathway. The present study suggests a pathological stage-related five-miRNA signature that may have clinical implications in predicting prognosis of ESCC patients.",2019,Scientific Reports

"The Challenges and Prospects of Murewa Growth Point, Zimbabwe","The growth pole theory originates from Francois Perroux, a French economist who visualized growth poles in economic space (Perroux, 1955). As such, his theory had nothing to do with physical or geographical space (Glasson, 1978). In fact, Perroux was mainly concerned with interactions among industrial sectors rather than spatial development processes (Hansen, 1981). However, geographers and planners adopted his theory for planning purposes. In this way, they developed the growth center theory. Some of the proponents of this theory were Boudeville, Friedmann, Myrdal and Hirschman. The growth center theory was first applied in European countries such as Britain, France and Italy in order to address the problems of economically depressed regions. Later on the strategy was adopted in developing nations of Latin America, Asia and Africa. In colonial Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), it was adopted in 1969 with the aim of decongesting major urban centers such as Salisbury (Harare), Bulawayo, Gwelo (Gweru) and Umtali (Mutare). However, the main problem of colonial growth points was the racial context in which they were conceived. At independence in 1980, the new black government adopted growth centers or growth points as a national strategy for rural development (Underwood, 1986). While colonial growth centers were introduced under the Tribal Trust Land Corporation (TILCOR), those of the post-colonial era are under the Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (ARDA). This study examines the challenges and prospects of Murewa growth point before and after independence in 1980. Article visualizations:",2018,European journal of social sciences

This paper describes the changes and present situations of state-society relations in France in the perspective of how society influences the state. Generally speaking, there are two main ways of citizens organizing themselves to express their wills, and which have coexistedand will coexist in the future, by institutionalassociations that take part in policy-making or affect policy implementation, and by extra-institutionalsocial movement, such as strikes,demonstrations and violenceconfrontations to voice themselves.

Providing biocatalysts through customizing lipases by different processes : II. Physico-chemical modifications of lipases and related enzymes,"The author is recalling first mechanisms of lipase catalyzed reactions. Hydrolyses and syntheses of triglycerides and esters, interesterification: generally these types of reactions are designed under the generic designation of acyl transfers. Enzymatic reactions are equilibrated, and then the displacement of the reaction in one or the other direction is highly depending on the thermodynamic activity of water (aw). This notion is discussed in depth. It is also emphasized on the quantity and quality of interface and also on the concept of pH memory or ionic force memory of the aqueous phase even whether this lost is confined or invisible. Lipases selectivity is especially developed and the author emphasizes on the possibility of changing selectivities through different perturbations. Physical and chemical modifications of lipases are then described throught the more pedagogic and spectacular examples. The author is also stressing on the mastership of reactions and processes imposing a task to lipases. He is finally concluding that in the space of fifty years, one ascertains a colassol work has been accomplished and that henceforward very current reactions for commodity products are available as certain companies are already doing. He is pointing out plant lipases are on the verge to meet deep and unexpected developments in a very near future since their production through agriculture is probably the lower cost mean of production.

EDLRT: Entropy-based dummy variables logistic regression tree,"An algorithm named EDLRT (entropy-based dummy variable logistic regression tree) has been developed to handle decision tree processes. The main feature of EDLRT is constructing an entropy-based non-linear regression tree in the form of logistic formula. EDLRT comprises two key steps: the first step is to establish a decision tree by selecting the splitting variables with maximum mutual information; the second step is to convert the splitting points into dummy variables and fit them into a logistic regression model, and use genetic or Lasso algorithm to estimate the coefficients of parameters. The mathematical treatment of various types of variables for entropy evaluation and splitting point determination is illustrated. The advantage in using mutual information as a key criterion in splitting variable selection is elucidated. Step-by-step procedure of decision tree construction and dummy variable manipulation are illustrated by case study. EDLRT is very tolerant to missing values and it is also very effective for outlier detection. These advantages are demonstrated with case studies.",2010,Intell. Data Anal.
One size does not fit all: involve orthopaedic implant patients in deciding whether to use prophylactic antibiotics with dental procedures.,"The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the AmericanDentalAssociation (ADA), along with input from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), American Association of Neurologic Surgeons (AANS), American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MIS), Scoliosis Research Society (SRS), American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS), Society for HealthcareEpidemiologyofAmerica (SHEA), College of American Pathologists, and The Knee Society, published the collaborative clinical practice guideline (CPG) â€œPrevention of Orthopaedic Implant Infection in Patients Undergoing Dental Proceduresâ€ on December 7, 2012.1 This AAOS-ADA guideline on dental prophylaxis for patients with orthopaedic implants addressed the weaknesses of previous efforts based on a systematic review of available evidence. The CPG also united the position of these organizations with respect to the necessity of dental prophylaxis in these patient groups, eliminating the contradictory guidelines and statements published by both the AAOS and ADA before 2012. Unfortunately, the halo effect of this unified position was limited, as evidenced by the recent ADA publication â€œThe use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints.â€2 This new ADA guideline again creates disagreement between the ADA and AAOS, along with associated specialty societies, including the AAHKS, The Hip Society, and The Knee Society, because the ADA CPG makes a moderate recommendation against routine dental prophylaxis in patients who have undergone hip and/or knee arthroplasty. This recommendation is at odds with the previous recommendation in the 2012 collaborative CPG supported by limited evidence. Our primary concern with the work of the ADA is that it is not supported by evidence and should, in fact, be labeled a consensus statement.TheADAguideline incorrectly includes three lower quality research articles to develop a stronger recommendation, which is not actually supported by evidence. We also object to this 2014 ADA manuscriptâ€™s being referred to as an â€œupdatedâ€ CPG because it uses different inclusion criteria from those of the 2012 AAOS-ADA CPG. For example, it includes articles (Swan et al,3 Jacobson et al4) that were specifically excluded by the multidisciplinary team that developed the 2012 CPG because these are retrospective studies that do not meet the criteria for inclusion. The third study added by the ADA (Skaar et al5) was published after the last literature search was done for the 2012 CPG, but it also would be excluded in a collaborative update because it is also a retrospective study.

"Discovery of a New Trechodine (Coleoptera, Trechinae) in the Russian Far East","A new genus and new species of trechodine trechid beetle is described from the southern part of the Sikhote-Alin Mountains in the Russian Far East, under the name of Eotrechodes larisae. It is closely similar to Thalassophilus WOLLASTON distributed over Europe and the Macaronesian islands, though its true affinity is not certain. Eotrechodes is the first representative of the subtribe Trechodina in East Asia north of 30Â°N. An almost unbelievable event in the study of the carabid subfamily Trechinae was recently made in the Russian Far East. It is the discovery of a new representative of the subtribe Trechodina at the southern part of the Sikhote-Alin Mountains. This subtribe has its main distributional range in the Southern Hemisphere, and in East Asia, only a small number of species have sporadically been known in the regions south of 30Â°N, mostly south of 20Â°N, that is, Luzon in the Philippines (JEANNEL, 1926, pp. 488, 491; UENO, 1988), Thailand (DEUVE, 1987, p. 145; UENO, 1989, 1990), Myanmar (BATES, 1892, p. 298; JEANNEL, 1926, pp. 488, 490), and East Nepal (UENO, 1981). It has been unknown from such northern regions as Mainland China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea, although the trechid fauna is already clarified fairly well especially in Japan and Taiwan.

Finding the balance between model complexity and performance: Using ventral striatal oscillations to classify feeding behavior in rats,"The ventral striatum (VS) is a central node within a distributed network that controls appetitive behavior, and neuromodulation of the VS has demonstrated therapeutic potential for appetitive disorders. Local field potential (LFP) oscillations recorded from deep brain stimulation electrodes within the VS are a pragmatic source of neural systems-level information about appetitive behavior that could be used in responsive neuromodulation systems. Here, we recorded LFPs from the bilateral nucleus accumbens core and shell (subregions of the VS) during limited access to palatable food across varying conditions of hunger and food palatability in male rats. We used standard statistical methods (logistic regression) as well as the machine learning algorithm lasso to predict aspects of feeding behavior using VS LFPs. These models were able to predict the amount of food eaten, the increase in consumption following food deprivation, and the type of food eaten. Further, we were able to predict whether the initiation of feeding was imminent up to 42.5 seconds before feeding began and classify current behavior as either feeding or not-feeding. In classifying this behavior, we found an optimal balance between model complexity and performance with models using 3 LFP features primarily from the alpha and high gamma frequencies. As shown here, unbiased methods can identify systems-level neural activity linked to symptoms of mental illness with potential application to the development and personalization of novel treatments. Author Summary As neuropsychiatry begins to leverage the power of computational methods to understand disease states and to develop better therapies, it is vital that we acknowledge the trade-offs between model complexity and performance. We show that computational methods can elucidate a neural signature of feeding behavior and show how these methods could be used to discover neural patterns related to other behaviors and used as therapeutic targets. Further, our results helps to contextualize both the limitations and potential of applying computational methods to neuropsychiatry by showing how changing the data being used to train predictive models (e.g., population vs. individual data) can have a large impact on how model performance generalizes across time, internal states and individuals.",2018,bioRxiv
Application of radiomics signature captured from pretreatment thoracic CT to predict brain metastases in stage III/IV ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer patients.,"Background
The purpose of this study is to develop a radiomics approach to predict brain metastasis (BM) for stage III/IV ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.


Methods
Patients with ALK-positive III/IV NSCLC from 2014 to 2017 were enrolled retrospectively. Their pretreatment thoracic CT images were collected, and the gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined by two experienced radiation oncologists. An in-house feature extraction code-set was performed based on MATLAB 2015b (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) in patients' CT images to extract features. Patients were randomly divided into training set and test set (4:1) by using createDataPartition function in caret package. A test-retest in RIDER NSCLC dataset was performed to identify stable radiomics features. LASSO Cox regression and a leave-one-out cross-validation were conducted to identify optimal features for the logistic regression model to evaluate the predictive value of radiomics feature(s) for BM. Furthermore, extended validation for the radiomics feature(s) and Cox regression analyses which combined radiomics feature(s) and treatment elements were implemented to predict the risk of BM during follow-up.


Results
In total, 132 patients were included, among which 27 patients had pretreatment BM. The median follow-up time was 11.8 (range, 0.1-65.2) months. In the training set, one radiomics feature (W_GLCM_LH_Correlation) showed discrimination ability of BM (P value =0.014, AUC =0.687, 95% CI: 0.551-0.824, specificity =83.5%, sensitivity =57.1%). It also exhibited reposeful performance in the test set (AUC =0.642, 95% CI: 0.501-0.783, specificity =60.0%, sensitivity =83.3%). Those 105 patients without pretreatment BM were divided into stage III (n=57) and stage IV (n=48) groups. The radiomics feature (W_GLCM_LH_Correlation) had moderate performance to predict BM during/after treatment in separate groups (stage III: AUC =0.682, 95% CI: 0.537-0.826, specificity =64.4%, sensitivity =75.0%; stage IV: AUC =0.653, 95% CI: 0.503-0.804, specificity =70.4%, sensitivity =75.0%). Meanwhile, stage III patients could be divided into low risk and high risk groups for BM during surveillance according to Cox regression analysis (log-rank P value =0.021).


Conclusions
We identified one wavelet texture feature derived from pretreatment thoracic CT that presented potential in predicting BM in stage III/IV ALK-positive NSCLC patients. This could be beneficial to risk stratification for such patients.

The following mysids are described: (1) The new genus Bacescomysis, which includes B. pacifica, new species, and five species of Hansenomysis: H. birsteini BÄƒcescu, H. peruvianus Bacescu, H. tattersallae BÄƒcescu, H. abyssalis Lagardere, and H. atlantica Lagardere. In this genus, closely related to Hansenomysis, the unjointed plate on the exopod of the uropod is the distinguishing feature. Bacescomysis pacifica is distinguished by its eyeplate, second thoracic endopod, second male pleopod, and telson. (2) The new species Boreomysis pearcyi is unique in its antennal scale, third thoracic endopod, telson, and body length. (3) Dactylerythrops latisquamosa, new species, is distinguished by its telson, eye, antennal scale, and endopod of first limb. (4) Paramblyops sp. is recognized as a new species by its rostrum and eyeplate, but is too damaged for a complete description. (5) The new genus Gibbamblyops resembles Dactylamblyops and Pseudamblyops, but is distinguished by the anterior margin of the carapace, eye, antennal peduncle, fourth male pleopod, and telson. These characters also define the uniqueness of its species, G. longisquamosa. (6) Thalassomysis tattersalli Nouvel, 1942, had been partially described from a single specimen. Four additional specimens of this species are recorded here. Slight differences are discussed, plus a complete description of the antennal peduncle and telson, which were lacking in the original description, are provided here. (7) Seven specimens of Holmesiella anomala Ortmann provided information on regional variation and allowed an opportunity for detailed drawings.",1985,Journal of Crustacean Biology

The Bayesian Elastic Net: Classifying Multi-Task Gene-Expression Data,"Highly correlated relevant features are frequently encountered in variable-selection problems, with gene-expression analysis an important example. It is desirable to select all of these highly correlated features simultaneously as a group, for better model interpretation and robustness. Further, irrelevant features should be excluded, resulting in a sparse solution (of importance for avoiding over-fitting with limited data). We address the problem of sparse and grouped variable selection by introducing a new Bayesian Elastic Net model. One advantage of the proposed model is that by imposing priors on individual parameters in the Laplace distribution, we reduce the number of tuning parameters to one, as compared with two such parameters in the original Elastic Net. In addition, we extend the new Bayesian Elastic Net model to the problem of probit regression, in order to deal with classification problems with a sparse but correlated set of covariates (features). Extension to multi-task learning is also considered, with inference performed using variational Bayesian analysis. The model is validated by first performing experiments on simulated data and on previously published gene-expression data; in these experiments we also perform comparisons to the original Elastic Net and to Bayesian Lasso. Finally, we present and analyze a new gene-expression data set for the time-evolving properties of influenza, measured using blood samples from human subjects in a recent challenge study.",2009,
A Modified Adaptive Lasso for Identifying Interactions in the Cox Model with the Heredity Constraint.,"In many biomedical studies, identifying effects of covariate interactions on survival is a major goal. Important examples are treatment-subgroup interactions in clinical trials, and gene-gene or gene-environment interactions in genomic studies. A common problem when implementing a variable selection algorithm in such settings is the requirement that the model must satisfy the strong heredity constraint, wherein an interaction may be included in the model only if the interaction's component variables are included as main effects. We propose a modified Lasso method for the Cox regression model that adaptively selects important single covariates and pairwise interactions while enforcing the strong heredity constraint. The proposed method is based on a modified log partial likelihood including two adaptively weighted penalties, one for main effects and one for interactions. A two-dimensional tuning parameter for the penalties is determined by generalized cross-validation. Asymptotic properties are established, including consistency and rate of convergence, and it is shown that the proposed selection procedure has oracle properties, given proper choice of regularization parameters. Simulations illustrate that the proposed method performs reliably across a range of different scenarios.",2014,Statistics & probability letters
An Efficient Reactive Power Control Method for Power Network Systems with Solar Photovoltaic Generators Using Sparse Optimization,"With the incremental introduction of solar photovoltaic (PV) generators into existing power systems, and their fast-growing share in the gross electricity generation, system voltage stability has become a critical issue. One of the major concerns is voltage fluctuation, due to large and random penetration of solar PV generators. To suppress severe system voltage deviation, reactive power control of the photovoltaic system inverter has been widely proposed in recent works; however, excessive use of reactive power control would increase both initial and operating costs. In this paper, a method for efficient allocation and control of reactive power injection using the sparse optimization technique is proposed. Based on a constrained linearized model describing the influence of reactive power injection on voltage magnitude change, the objective of this study is formulated as an optimization problem, which aims to find the best reactive power injection that minimizes the whole system voltage variation. Two types of formulations are compared: the first one is the conventional least-square optimization, while the second one is adopted from a sparse optimization technique, called the constrained least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The constrained LASSO method adds l 1 -norm penalty to the total reactive power injection, which contributes to the suppression of the number of control nodes with non-zero reactive power injection. The authors analyzed the effectiveness of the constrained LASSO method using the IEEE 39-bus and 57-bus power network as benchmark examples, under various PV power generation and allocation patterns. The simulation results show that the constrained LASSO method automatically selects the minimum number of inverters required for voltage regulation at the current operating point.",2017,Energies
Empirical extensions of the lasso penalty to reduce the false discovery rate in high-dimensional Cox regression models.,"Correct selection of prognostic biomarkers among multiple candidates is becoming increasingly challenging as the dimensionality of biological data becomes higher. Therefore, minimizing the false discovery rate (FDR) is of primary importance, while a low false negative rate (FNR) is a complementary measure. The lasso is a popular selection method in Cox regression, but its results depend heavily on the penalty parameter Î». Usually, Î» is chosen using maximum cross-validated log-likelihood (max-cvl). However, this method has often a very high FDR. We review methods for a more conservative choice of Î». We propose an empirical extension of the cvl by adding a penalization term, which trades off between the goodness-of-fit and the parsimony of the model, leading to the selection of fewer biomarkers and, as we show, to the reduction of the FDR without large increase in FNR. We conducted a simulation study considering null and moderately sparse alternative scenarios and compared our approach with the standard lasso and 10 other competitors: Akaike information criterion (AIC), corrected AIC, Bayesian information criterion (BIC), extended BIC, Hannan and Quinn information criterion (HQIC), risk information criterion (RIC), one-standard-error rule, adaptive lasso, stability selection, and percentile lasso. Our extension achieved the best compromise across all the scenarios between a reduction of the FDR and a limited raise of the FNR, followed by the AIC, the RIC, and the adaptive lasso, which performed well in some settings. We illustrate the methods using gene expression data of 523 breast cancer patients. In conclusion, we propose to apply our extension to the lasso whenever a stringent FDR with a limited FNR is targeted. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2016,Statistics in medicine

Staphylokokkus (S.) aureus stellt ein sehr vielseitiges Bakterium dar. Wahrend die asymptomatische Kolonisation der Nase weit verbreitet ist, konnen S. aureus auch schwere Infektionen, Toxikosen und lebensbedrohliche Erkrankungen in Mensch und Tier verursachen. Lebensmittelintoxikationen verursacht durch Staphylokokken (SFP) haben weltweit eine der hochsten Pravalenzen bei der durch Lebensmittel assoziierten Intoxikationen. Kurze Zeit nach der oralen Aufnahme von Staphylokokkus Enterotoxinen setzen die Symptome, gezeichnet durch heftiges Erbrechen, Durchfall und Krampfe, ein. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Studie war das Vergleichen isolierter Stamme aus lebensmittelassoziierten Ausbruchen mit solchen aus humaner nasaler Kolonisation und Fallen von klinischen Staphylokokkusinfektionen beim Mensch um eine mogliche Quelle fur SFP zu identifizieren. Zur Analyse wurden Spa typing und DNA microarray durchgefuhrt. Untersucht wurden insgesamt 120 Isolate, wovon 50 Isolate aus der Nase von gesunden Spendern, 50 Isolate von Fallen von klinischen Infektionen in Menschen und 20 Isolate, die lebensmittelassoziierte Ausbruche verursachten, stammten. Mehrere gelaufige spa Typen wurden bei Isolaten aller drei Gruppen gefunden (t015, t018, t056, t086). Der DNA microarray zeigte sehr ahnliche Virulenzgenprofile fur Isolate aller Gruppen. Anhand dieser Resultate stellen die humane nasale Kolonisation und Infektion eine mogliche SFP Quelle dar und auf eine Kontamination der Lebensmittel durch das Personal kann hingewiesen werden.

 Comparison of Staphylococcus aureus isolates associated with food intoxication with isolates from human nasal carriers and human infections 
 
Staphylococcus (S.) aureus represents an organism of striking versatility. While asymptomatic nasal colonization is widespread, it can also cause serious infections, toxinoses and life- threatening illnesses in humans and animals. Staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP), one of the most prevalent causes of foodborne intoxication worldwide, results from oral intake of staphylococcal enterotoxins leading to violent vomiting, diarrhea and cramps shortly upon ingestion. The aim of the present study was to compare isolates associated with SFP to isolates collected from cases of human nasal colonization and clinical infections in order to investigate the role of S. aureus colonizing and infecting humans as a possible source of SFP. Spa typing and DNA microarray profiling were used to characterize a total of 120 isolates, comprising 50 isolates collected from the anterior nares of healthy donors, 50 isolates obtained from cases of clinical infections in humans and 20 isolates related to outbreaks of SFP. Several common spa types were found among isolates of all three sources (t015, t018, t056, t084). DNA microarray results showed highly similar virulence gene profiles for isolates from all sources. These results suggest contamination of foodstuff with S. aureus colonizing and infecting food handlers to represent a source of SFP.

Statistical and machine learning methods evaluated for incorporating soil and weather into corn nitrogen recommendations,"Abstract Nitrogen (N) fertilizer recommendation tools could be improved for estimating corn (Zea mays L.) N needs by incorporating site-specific soil and weather information. However, an evaluation of analytical methods is needed to determine the success of incorporating this information. The objectives of this research were to evaluate statistical and machine learning (ML) algorithms for utilizing soil and weather information for improving corn N recommendation tools. Eight algorithms [stepwise, ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), elastic net regression, principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), decision tree, and random forest] were evaluated using a dataset containing measured soil and weather variables from a regional database. The performance was evaluated based on how well these algorithms predicted corn economically optimal N rates (EONR) from 49 sites in the U.S. Midwest. Multiple algorithm modeling scenarios were examined with and without adjustment for multicollinearity and inclusion of two-way interaction terms to identify the soil and weather variables that could improve three dissimilar N recommendation tools. Results showed the out-of-sample root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the decision tree and some random forest modeling scenarios were better than the stepwise or ridge regression, but not significantly different than any other algorithm. The best ML algorithm for adjusting N recommendation tools was the random forest approach (r2 increased between 0.72 and 0.84 and the RMSE decreased between 41 and 94â€¯kgâ€¯Nâ€¯haâˆ’1). However, the ML algorithm that best adjusted tools while using a minimal amount of variables was the decision tree. This method was simple, needing only one or two variables (regardless of modeling scenario) and provided moderate improvement as r2 values increased between 0.15 and 0.51 and RMSE decreased between 16 and 66â€¯kgâ€¯Nâ€¯haâˆ’1. Using ML algorithms to adjust N recommendation tools with soil and weather information shows promising results for better N management in the U.S. Midwest.",2019,Comput. Electron. Agric.

Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Treatment and Causal Parameters,"Most modern supervised statistical/machine learning (ML) methods are explicitly designed to solve prediction problems very well. Achieving this goal does not imply that these methods automatically deliver good estimators of causal parameters. Examples of such parameters include individual regression coefficients, average treatment effects, average lifts, and demand or supply elasticities. In fact, estimates of such causal parameters obtained via naively plugging ML estimators into estimating equations for such parameters can behave very poorly due to the regularization bias. Fortunately, this regularization bias can be removed by solving auxiliary prediction problems via ML tools. Specifically, we can form an orthogonal score for the target low-dimensional parameter by combining auxiliary and main ML predictions. The score is then used to build a de-biased estimator of the target parameter which typically will converge at the fastest possible 1/root(n) rate and be approximately unbiased and normal, and from which valid confidence intervals for these parameters of interest may be constructed. The resulting method thus could be called a ""double ML"" method because it relies on estimating primary and auxiliary predictive models. In order to avoid overfitting, our construction also makes use of the K-fold sample splitting, which we call cross-fitting. This allows us to use a very broad set of ML predictive methods in solving the auxiliary and main prediction problems, such as random forest, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, as well as various hybrids and aggregators of these methods.",2017,arXiv: Machine Learning
"Forecasting Time Charter Equivalent Oil Tanker Freight Rates - determinant driven, route-specific Markov regime-switching models","In this thesis, we address the issue of explaining and forecasting oil tanker freight rates for specific tanker routes. These freight rates are known to exhibit periods of extreme volatility. To predict the freight rates, we therefore utilise a Markov regime-switching multiple regression model with two states a normal state, and a volatile state. This thesis hence postulates that predictions of short-term freight rates can be improved through a framework that can capture the distinctive nature of freight rates by switching between two regimes, while combining this with hypothetically superior route-specific and global determinants. We make a substantial attempt to combine market domain knowledge with statistical methods. Our approach to doing so is twofold. Firstly, motivated by the findings in the existing literature, the observations of structural breaks, and the plethora of attempts at modelling the freight rate, we characterise the market. Six tanker routes, TD1, TD3, TD7, TD12, TC1, and TC2, are investigated. An extensive assessment of the key determining factors of the freight rates is given. A candidate predictor analysis is done, based on subsampling in combination with a selection algorithm. By using the novel approach of stability selection and LASSO penalization with a random tuning parameter, we are able to rank the factors based on their potential modelling importance. Secondly, we develop a Markov regime-switching regression model for one-month ahead forecasting of the freight rates on the selected routes. The data is tested for structural breaks using a Chow test, and indications of multiple regimes are found. With a subset of variables for each route, we formulate two-regime regression models with switching coefficients. Seasonal changes and varying lags are accounted for, and the result is six regime models which are tailored specifically to each route. Three objectives are evaluated on out-of-sample data for each route: i ) An evaluation of whether similar parsimonious models outperform variable rich models. Six additional parsimonious regime models are therefore created, one for each route. The parsimonious models are found to provide better predictions based on performance metrics and the Diebold-Mariano test for forecasting accuracy. Top performing variables in the parsimonious models include, amongst others, secondhand prices, import and export factors, Chinese crude imports, vessel fixtures, and the ClarkSea index. ii ) An assessment of the forecasting capabilities of the regime model on never-before-seen data. These models yield promising results, and consistently rank in the top positions in regards to forecasting when compared to a set of benchmark models. iii ) An evaluation of the benefit of incorporating route-specific variables. The route-specific regime models are compared to a generic benchmark regime model with globally universal variables. Route-specific regime models are found to provide valuable outcomes and they improve the forecast in most cases, as opposed to the generic factor-driven models.",2018,
Safe Screening With Variational Inequalities and Its Applicaiton to LASSO,"Sparse learning techniques have been routinely used for feature selection as the resulting model usually has a small number of non-zero entries. Safe screening, which eliminates the features that are guaranteed to have zero coefficients for a certain value of the regularization parameter, is a technique for improving the computational efficiency. Safe screening is gaining increasing attention since 1) solving sparse learning formulations usually has a high computational cost especially when the number of features is large and 2) one needs to try several regularization parameters to select a suitable model. In this paper, we propose an approach called ""Sasvi"" (Safe screening with variational inequalities). Sasvi makes use of the variational inequality that provides the sufficient and necessary optimality condition for the dual problem. Several existing approaches for Lasso screening can be casted as relaxed versions of the proposed Sasvi, thus Sasvi provides a stronger safe screening rule. We further study the monotone properties of Sasvi for Lasso, based on which a sure removal regularization parameter can be identified for each feature. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Sasvi for Lasso screening.",2014,ArXiv
Analysis of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Data Using the Distribution of Relaxation Times: A Bayesian and Hierarchical Bayesian Approach,"Abstract Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the most important experimental techniques employed in electrochemistry because it can be used to deconvolve physico-chemical phenomena occurring at disparate timescales. Unfortunately, the analysis of EIS data is frequently challenging since it can require the selection of ad hoc equivalent circuits. The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) method is complementary to the approach of fitting equivalent circuits because the DRT maps the EIS data onto a function containing the timescale characteristics of the system under study. While conceptually simple, the DRT cannot be obtained by simple minimization of the least squares because the corresponding optimization problem is ill posed. Regularization methods, such as ridge/Tikhonov or Lasso regression, add a penalty term to the least squares minimization problem enabling the DRT deconvolution. In this work, we show that such regularization methods may be understood in a Bayesian context. For example, ridge/Tikhonov regression implicitly encapsulates the prior insight that the derivatives of the DRT are regular. We use this Bayesian approach as a starting point to extend the DRT regularization by considering frequency dependent oscillation levels. This approach is shown to be more robust with respect to both discontinuities and over smoothing than typical regularized DRT methods. Furthermore, the Bayesian approach is versatile and may be extended to include more informative priors.",2015,Electrochimica Acta
Causal Network Inference Via,"This paper addresses the problem of inferring sparse causal networks modeled by multivariate autoregressive (MAR) processes. Conditions are derived under which the Group Lasso (gLasso) procedure consistently estimates sparse network structure. The key condition involves a ""false connection score"" . In particular, we show that consistent recovery is possible even when the number of observations of the network is far less than the number of parameters describing the network, provided that . The false connection score is also demonstrated to be a useful metric of recovery in nonasymptotic regimes. The condi- tions suggest a modified gLasso procedure which tends to improve the false connection score and reduce the chances of reversing the direction of causal influence. Computational experiments and a real network based electrocorticogram (ECoG) simulation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",2011,
Identifying the Prognosis Factors and Predicting the Survival Probability in Patients with Nonâ€Metastatic Chondrosarcoma from the SEER Database,"OBJECTIVE
To identify prognostic factors and establish nomograms for predicting overall survival (OS) and cause specific survival (CSS) of patients with non-metastatic chondrosarcoma.


METHODS
We collected information on patients with non-metastatic chondrosarcoma from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2005 and 2014, together with data from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from 2011 to 2016. Variables including patients' baseline demographics (age, race, and gender), tumor characteristics (tumor size and extension, histology subtype, primary site, and American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage), therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy), and socioeconomic status (SES) were extracted for further analysis. OS and CSS were retrieved as our researching endpoints. Patients from the database were regarded as the training set, and univariate analysis, Lasso regression and multivariate analysis as well as the random forest were used to explore the predictors and establish nomograms. To validate nomograms internally and externally, we applied bootstrapped validation internally with the training dataset, while the dataset for external validation was obtained from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. We estimated the discriminative ability of nomograms based on Cox proportional hazard regression models by means of calibration curves and the concordance index (C-index) of internal and external validation.


RESULTS
After the implementation of exclusion criteria, there were 1267 patients in the training set and 72 patients in the testing set with non-metastatic chondrosarcomas. Age, gender, grade, histological subtype, primary site, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, being employed/unemployed, tumor size, and tumor extension were significantly associated with prognosis in the univariate analysis. Age, gender, tumor size and extension, primary site, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, histological grade, and subtype were independent prognostic factors in the Cox models. The C-index of nomograms (internal: OS, 0.787; CSS, 0.821; external: OS, 0.777; CSS, 0.821) were higher than following conventional systems: AJCC sixth (OS, 0.640; CSS, 0.673) and seventh edition (OS, 0.675; CSS, 0.711).


CONCLUSIONS
Age, gender, tumor size and extension, surgery, histological grade, and subtype were independent prognostic factors for both OS and CSS. In addition, we revealed that chondrosarcomas in the trunk, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were correlated with poor prognosis. Our nomograms based on significant clinicopathologic features can well predict the 3-year and 5-year survival probability of patients with non-metastatic chondrosarcoma and assist oncologists in making accurate survival evaluation.",2019,Orthopaedic Surgery
Neither Global Nor Local: A Hierarchical Robust Subspace Clustering For Image Data,"In this paper, we consider the problem of subspace clustering in presence of contiguous noise, occlusion and disguise. We argue that self-expressive representation of data in current state-of-the-art approaches is severely sensitive to occlusions and complex real-world noises. To alleviate this problem, we propose a hierarchical framework that brings robustness of local patches-based representations and discriminant property of global representations together. This approach consists of 1) a top-down stage, in which the input data is subject to repeated division to smaller patches and 2) a bottom-up stage, in which the low rank embedding of local patches in field of view of a corresponding patch in upper level are merged on a Grassmann manifold. This summarized information provides two key information for the corresponding patch on the upper level: cannot-links and recommended-links. This information is employed for computing a self-expressive representation of each patch at upper levels using a weighted sparse group lasso optimization problem. Numerical results on several real data sets confirm the efficiency of our approach.",2020,Inf. Sci.
Rule Extraction from Decision Trees Ensembles: New Algorithms Based on Heuristic Search and Sparse Group Lasso Methods,"Decision trees are examples of easily interpretable models whose predictive accuracy is normally low. In comparison, decision tree ensembles (DTEs) such as random forest (RF) exhibit high predictive accuracy while being regarded as black-box models. We propose three new rule extraction algorithms from DTEs. The RF+DHC method, a hill climbing method with downhill moves (DHC), is used to search for a rule set that decreases the number of rules dramatically. In the RF+SGL and RF+MSGL methods, the sparse group lasso (SGL) method, and the multiclass SGL (MSGL) method are employed respectively to find a sparse weight vector corresponding to the rules generated by RF. Experimental results with 24 data sets show that the proposed methods outperform similar state-of-the-art methods, in terms of human comprehensibility, by greatly reducing the number of rules and limiting the number of antecedents in the retained rules, while preserving the same level of accuracy.",2017,Int.

A study on tuning parameter selection for the high-dimensional lasso,"ABSTRACT High-dimensional predictive models, those with more measurements than observations, require regularization to be well defined, perform well empirically, and possess theoretical guarantees. The amount of regularization, often determined by tuning parameters, is integral to achieving good performance. One can choose the tuning parameter in a variety of ways, such as through resampling methods or generalized information criteria. However, the theory supporting many regularized procedures relies on an estimate for the variance parameter, which is complicated in high dimensions. We develop a suite of information criteria for choosing the tuning parameter in lasso regression by leveraging the literature on high-dimensional variance estimation. We derive intuition showing that existing information-theoretic approaches work poorly in this setting. We compare our risk estimators to existing methods with an extensive simulation and derive some theoretical justification. We find that our new estimators perform well across a wide range of simulation conditions and evaluation criteria.",2018,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
Structural properties of methanol-water binary mixtures within the quantum cluster equilibrium model.,"Density functional theory (B3LYP-D3, M06-2X) has been used to calculate the structures, interaction energies and vibrational frequencies of a set of 93 methanol-water clusters of different type (cubic, ring, spiro, lasso, bicyclic), size and composition. These interaction energies have been used within the framework of the Quantum Cluster Equilibrium Theory (QCE) to calculate cluster populations as well as thermodynamic properties of binary methanol-water mixtures spanning the whole range from pure water to pure methanol. The necessary parameters amf and bxv of the QCE model were obtained by fitting to experimental isobars of MeOH-H2O mixtures with different MeOH content. The cubic and spiro motifs dominate the distribution of methanol-water clusters in the mixtures with a maximum of mixed clusters at x(MeOH) = 0.365. Reasonable agreement with experimental data as well as earlier molecular dynamics simulations was found for excess enthalpies H(E), entropies S(E) as well as Gibbs free energies of mixing G(E).

Two-Step Lasso Estimation of the Spatial Weights Matrix,"The vast majority of spatial econometric research relies on the assumption that the spatial network structure is known a priori. This study considers a two-step estimation strategy for estimating the n(n-1) interaction effects in a spatial autoregressive panel model where the spatial dimension is potentially large. The identifying assumption is approximate sparsity of the spatial weights matrix. The proposed estimation methodology exploits the Lasso estimator and mimics two-stage least squares (2SLS) to account for endogeneity of the spatial lag. The developed two-step estimator is of more general interest. It may be used in applications where the number of endogenous regressors and the number of instrumental variables is larger than the number of observations. We derive convergence rates for the two-step Lasso estimator. Our Monte Carlo simulation results show that the two-step estimator is consistent and successfully recovers the spatial network structure for reasonable sample size, T .",2015,Econometrics

On the other hand, indicators like the process of detraining, the rehabilitation to the ordinary life, or the plans of promotion for ex-athletes, can be a priori, very important indicators of this relation in athletes already retired years ago. The joint analysis of these indicators might offer important information on the connection that the performance and the health keep, as much in the athletesÂ´ active life as once already retired.

"Tool-like behavior in the sixbar wrasse, Thalassoma hardwicke (Bennett, 1830).","There are only a few documented cases of the use of either tools or substrates (anvils) as pseudotools in fishes. Described here is an anvil behavior of a labrid fish, Thalassoma hardwicke, observed under aquarium conditions. This fish was fed with pellets that are too large to swallow and too hard to break up into manageable bits using jaws only. The observed individual carried a pellet to an anvil to break it up into pieces small enough to be swallowed. This feeding behavior was frequently repeated (observed in detail about 15 times), nearly always successful, and remarkably consistent, suggesting that the rock selected for an anvil is remembered and its functional qualities or other factors may play a part in its choice. These observations agree with evidence for other advanced cognitive abilities in members of the genus Thalassoma and suggest that, for welfare demand, rocks with rough surfaces should be provided to these fish, especially when they receive hard food for variety.",2010,Zoo biology
Neutrino emission in the late stages of massive star evolution,"SummaryThe advanced evolutionary phase of massive stars [M=(102Ã·104)MâŠ™] is studied by using Hoyle-Fowler models in order to define some problems which could have importance in a theory of Supernovae (type II). For such a purpose, and since the time evolution of the collapse is completely governed by neutrino emission, a brief analysis of all the neutrino production processes is presented. The role played by electron-positron creation on the photoneutrino process is considered. For nondegenerate electrons, it results a much more efficient process than that first calculated byChiu and byRitus, but the energy loss per gram per second is only âˆ¼ 10âˆ’3 times the one from the pair annihilation process. The peculiar importance of the new UECA process recently proposed byPinaev and byWataghin is also considered. This process, which is well established and is independent of the Feynman theory on weak interactions, is extremely efficient; and even, in some physical conditions, it predominates over all the other Feynman processes, maintaining the astrophysical validity of our conclusions, even if the Feynman theory should be invalidated in the future. Time scale and total energy loss by neutrino emission during collapse are calculated. Mechanisms which could prevent the collapsing star to reach the Schwarzschild singularity are discussed, namely, carbon thermonuclear reactions, rotation and magnetic pressure.RiassuntoSi analizzano le ultime fasi evolutive di stelle di grande massa [M=102/l04)MâŠ™], servendosi del modello di Hoyle e Fowler, allo scopo di precisare alcuni elementi che possono avere importanza nella teoria delle Supernovae di tipo II. A tale scopo, viene presentato un quadro generale dei vari processi di emissione di neutrini finora proposti. Il processo fotoneutrinioo viene esteso, tenendo conto della formazione di coppie; esso risulta, in caso di non degenerazione elettronica, fortemente accresciuto rispetto ai valori ottenuti daChiu eRitus, ma risulta âˆ¼ 103 volte meno efficiente del processo di annichilazione di coppie. Si mette in evidenza la grande efficienza del processo URCA proposto daPinaev e daWataghin, si mostra che in certe condizioni fisiche tale processo risulta superiore a tutti gli altri processi, che si basano sulla teoria di Feynman delle interazioni deboli. Qualora la teoria di Feynman non venisse convalidata dallâ€™esperienza, lâ€™efficienza del prooesso URCA Ã¨ tale da mantenere la validitÃ  astrofisica della nostra interpretazione dei collassi stellari. Si calcolano i tempi scala e lâ€™energia totale dei neutrini emessi durante il collasso. Vengono discussi alcuni meccanismi che potrebbero impedire alla Stella che collassa di raggiungere la singolaritÃ  di Sehwarzschild: leazioni termonucleari del carbonio, rotazione e pressione magnetica.",1965,Il Nuovo Cimento (1955-1965)
Generalized Thresholding of Large Covariance Matrices,"We propose a new class of generalized thresholding operators that combine thresholding with shrinkage, and study generalized thresholding of the sample covariance matrix in high dimensions. Generalized thresholding of the covariance matrix has good theoretical properties and carries almost no computational burden. We obtain an explicit convergence rate in the operator norm that shows the tradeoff between the sparsity of the true model, dimension, and the sample size, and shows that generalized thresholding is consistent over a large class of models as long as the dimension p and the sample size n satisfy log p/n â†’ 0. In addition, we show that generalized thresholding has the â€œsparsistencyâ€ property, meaning it estimates true zeros as zeros with probability tending to 1, and, under an additional mild condition, is sign consistent for nonzero elements. We show that generalized thresholding covers, as special cases, hard and soft thresholding, smoothly clipped absolute deviation, and adaptive lasso, and comp...",2009,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Some theoretical results on the Grouped Variables Lasso,"We consider the linear regression model with Gaussian error. We estimate the unknown parameters by a procedure inspired by the Group Lasso estimator introduced in [22]. We show that this estimator satisfies a sparsity inequality, i.e., a bound in terms of the number of non-zero components of the oracle regression vector. We prove that this bound is better, in some cases, than the one achieved by the Lasso and the Dantzig selector.",2008,Mathematical Methods of Statistics
Adaptive Piecewise Polynomial Estimation via Trend Filtering 1,"We study trend filtering, a recently proposed tool of Kim et al. [SIAM Rev. 51 (2009) 339â€“360] for nonparametric regression. The trend filtering estimate is defined as the minimizer of a penalized least squares criterion, in which the penalty term sums the absolute kth order discrete derivatives over the input points. Perhaps not surprisingly, trend filtering estimates appear to have the structure of kth degree spline functions, with adaptively chosen knot points (we say â€œappearâ€ here as trend filtering estimates are not really functions over continuous domains, and are only defined over the discrete set of inputs). This brings to mind comparisons to other nonparametric regression tools that also produce adaptive splines; in particular, we compare trend filtering to smoothing splines, which penalize the sum of squared derivatives across input points, and to locally adaptive regression splines [Ann. Statist. 25 (1997) 387â€“413], which penalize the total variation of the kth derivative. Empirically, we discover that trend filtering estimates adapt to the local level of smoothness much better than smoothing splines, and further, they exhibit a remarkable similarity to locally adaptive regression splines. We also provide theoretical support for these empirical findings; most notably, we prove that (with the right choice of tuning parameter) the trend filtering estimate converges to the true underlying function at the minimax rate for functions whose kth derivative is of bounded variation. This is done via an asymptotic pairing of trend filtering and locally adaptive regression splines, which have already been shown to converge at the minimax rate [Ann. Statist. 25 (1997) 387â€“413]. At the core of this argument is a new result tying together the fitted values of two lasso problems that share the same outcome vector, but have different predictor matrices.",2014,
A prediction scheme of tropical cyclone frequency based on lasso and random forest,"This study aims to propose a novel prediction scheme of tropical cyclone frequency (TCF) over the Western North Pacific (WNP). We concerned the large-scale meteorological factors inclusive of the sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, the NiÃ±o-3.4 index, the wind shear, the vorticity, the subtropical high, and the sea ice cover, since the chronic change of these factors in the context of climate change would cause a gradual variation of the annual TCF. Specifically, we focus on the correlation between the year-to-year increment of these factors and TCF. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method was used for variable selection and dimension reduction from 11 initial predictors. Then, a prediction model based on random forest (RF) was established by using the training samples (1978â€“2011) for calibration and the testing samples (2012â€“2016) for validation. The RF model presents a major variation and trend of TCF in the period of calibration, and also fitted well with the observed TCF in the period of validation though there were some deviations. The leave-one-out cross validation of the model exhibited most of the predicted TCF are in consistence with the observed TCF with a high correlation coefficient. A comparison between results of the RF model and the multiple linear regression (MLR) model suggested the RF is more practical and capable of giving reliable results of TCF prediction over the WNP.",2017,Theoretical and Applied Climatology

Optimal disease outbreak decisions using stochastic simulation,Management policies for disease outbreaks balance the expected morbidity and mortality costs versus the cost of intervention policies. We present a methodology for dynamic determination of optimal policies in a stochastic compartmental model with parameter uncertainty. Our approach is to first carry out sequential Bayesian estimation of outbreak parameters and then solve the dynamic programming equations. The latter step is simulation-based and relies on regression Monte Carlo techniques. To improve performance we investigate lasso regression and global policy iteration. Comparisons demonstrate the realized cost savings of choosing interventions based on the computed dynamic policy over simpler decision rules.,2011,Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)
"Music for Shakespeare's ""Samingo"": Lasso Versus Anon","In Shakespeare Quarterly, IX (i958), io5-ii6, F. W. Sternfeld gives a fascinating account of the bibliographical history of a chanson by Orlando di Lasso and its connection with this snatch of song sung by Silence in 2 Henry IV, V. iii. 77. To the sources there listed can now be added an arrangement of Lasso's music for solo lute, subscribed ""on nef peulto / Orlande / a 4"", in Trinity College, Dublin, MS. D.3.30., pp. 78-79 (the ""Dallis"" lute book). The title ""on nef peulto"" derives from the substitute text quoted under source V: ""On ne peut le fol amour souler"". This concordance is noted by John Ward and his graduate pupils in a recent study of the ""Dallis"" lute book in The Lute Society Journal, IX (i967), I7-40. The manuscript was compiled in the late i6th century and contains numerous Continental works. The presence of Lasso's chanson among them is further testimony to its great popularity. But the discovery of another, quite different song related to Shakespeare's ""Samingo"", which I shall discuss shortly, leads us to consider again the precise connection between Silence's ditty and the Lasso. As Dr. Sternfeld is careful to point out (p. II4), the words that Silence sings are not a translation from any of the French texts associated with Lasso's chanson. This reminder is not altogether gratuitous since the New Arden edition (London, i966) is misleading on this matter (p. I72). The connection between the two may be briefly summarized as follows: Silence's words embody catch-phrases or commonplaces associated with drinking which are also found in an English text substituted for the original French in three manuscript copies of Lasso's music' as well as in Nashe, Marston, Chapman and Jonson.2 Thus the Lasso is in the nature of an analogue to Silence's song, not the source of it, and hence its music has no special claim to be that actually sung by Silence. Here again a recent commentator has thrown caution to the winds, asserting that the ""original music for [Silence's song] was composed by Orlando de Las-",1972,Shakespeare Quarterly
Zur Pathophysiologie der postcommotionellen Kopfschmerzen,"Zusammenfassung1.Der wohltÃ„tige Effekt einer Blockade der suprafascialen (kutanen) NervenstÃ„mme des SchÃ„deldaches bei chronischem postcommotionellem Kopfschmerz hat sein Analogon in der schmerzaufhebenden Wirkung einer suprafascialen Blockade der Pcta. maxima vonMackenzie bei chronischem Ã¼bertragenem Schmerz.2.Als primÃ„re Ursache der postcommotionellen Kopfschmerzen wird die StÃ¶rung eines Regulationsvorganges angenommen, welcher die intrakranielle Vasomotorik und die Plexussekretion im Sinne der Aufrechterhaltung einer entsprechenden Druckdifferenz zwischen intrakapillarem und intrakraniellem Druck abstimmt (Filtrationsdruck). Die hÃ„ufige Korrelation von HirnÃ¶dem und Hydrocephalus, von Deshydration des Gehirnparenchyms und Ventrikelkollaps, sowie der therapeutische Effekt der intravenÃ¶sen Injektion, hyper- bzw. hypotoner LÃ¶sungen wird durch diesen Regulationsmechanismus zu erklÃ„ren gesucht.3.Es wird zur ErwÃ„gung gestellt, ob das unkomplizierte Commotionssyndrom als neurogener Schock aufzufassen ist.SummaryThe beneficial effect when anesthetizing the suprafascial cutaneous nerve trunks of the cranium in post-commotional headache, has its analogon in the analgesic effect of suprafascial anesthesia ofMackenzie's â€œpuncta maximaâ€ in chronic referred pain.The primary cause of post-commotional headache is supposed to be the disturbance of regulation meant to establish a correlation between the intracranial vascular tonus and the secretion of the plexus coroideus which warrants a physiological difference of intracapillar and intracranial pressure, and therefore constant values of the resulting filtration. The frequent co-existence of cerebral edema and hydrocephalus, dehydration of the cerebral parenchyma and ventricular collapse as well as the therapeutic effect of intravenous injections of hyper- and hypotonic solutions may be explained admitting afore-mentioned regulatory mechanism and its reversible disturbances.On this basis, it is discussed whether the uncomplicated post-commotional syndrome may be regarded as neurogenic shock.RÃ©sumÃ©L'auteur fait ressortir que l'effet bienfaisant du blocage sus-galÃ©al des troncs nerveux cutanÃ©s de la calotte cranienne en cas de cÃ©phalÃ©e post-commotionnelle chronique a son analogie dans l'effet algolytique du blocage sus-aponÃ©vrotique des points maxima deMackenzie dans les douleurs rÃ©flexes chroniques.Le trouble de la rÃ©gulation des rapports entre la vasomotilitÃ© intracranienne et la secrÃ©tion du liquide cÃ©phalo-rachidien est considÃ©rÃ© comme Ã©tant la cause primaire des cÃ©phalÃ©es postcommotionnelles. GrÃ¢ce Ã  la rÃ©gulation susdite, la diffÃ©rence des tensions capillaire et celle du liquide cÃ©phalo-rachidien (= tension de filtration) est, Ã  l'Ã©tat normal, maintenue Ã  un niveau physiologique. Tout en recourant Ã  ce mÃ©canisme de rÃ©gulation, l'auteur tente d'expliquer la correlation frÃ©quente entre l'oedÃ¨me cÃ©rÃ©bral et l'hydrocÃ©phalie d'un cÃ”tÃ© et la dyshydratation du parenchyme cÃ©rÃ©bral et le collapse des ventricules cÃ©rÃ©braux de l'autre cÃ”tÃ© ainsi que l'effet thÃ©rapeutique des injections intraveineuses de solutions hyper- et hypotoniques.Quant au syndrome post-commotionnel sans complication, il faudrait delibÃ©rÃ©r s'il puisse ÃŠtre considÃ©rÃ© comme Ã©tant un choc neurogÃ¨ne.RiassuntoL'effetto benefico di un blocco dei tronchi nervosi cutanei soprafasciali in casi di cefalea cronica postcommozionale, trova la sua analogia nell'effetto analgesico di un blocco soprafasciale della â€žpuncta maximaâ€œ diMackenzie nel dolore cronico riferito.Come causa principale della cefalea postcommozionale viene considerata l'alterazione del processo di regolazione fra la tonicitÃ  vasomotrice intracranica e secrezione dei plessi, intese come il mantenimento di una differenza fisiologica fra la pressione intracapillare e quella intracranica (Pressione di filtrazione). I frequenti rapporti fra edema cerebrale e idrocefalo, fra disidratazione del parenchima cerebrale e collasso del ventricolo, come pure l'effetto terapeutico dell'iniezione di soluzioni iper- e ipotoniche trova la sua spiegazione in questo meccanismo regolatore.ResumenEl efecto beneficioso del bloqueo de los troncos nerviosos cutaneos de la calota craneana en las cefaleas crÃ³nicas postconmocionales es anÃ¡logo al efecto analgÃ©sico de una novocainizaciÃ³n subcutanea de los â€žpuntos maximalesâ€œ deMackenzie en el dolor referido crÃ³nico. Como causa primaria de las cefaleas postconmocionales se considera una alteraciÃ³n de una funciÃ³n reguladora destinada a mantener una correlaciÃ³n adecuada entre la tonicidad de los vasos intracraneanos y la secreciÃ³n del plexo coroÃ­deo para conservar asÃ­ la diferencia fisiolÃ³gica entre la presiÃ³n intracapilar y la intracraneana. (PresiÃ³n de filtraciÃ³n.) La frecuente correlaciÃ³n entre edema cerebral y colapso del ventrÃ­culo, como los efectos terapeuticos de las inyecciones intravenosas de soluciones hiper- o hipotÃ³nicas respectivamente, pueden explicarse por la admisiÃ³n de tal regulaciÃ³n.

[Electrocardiography coupled with transthoracic echocardiography at rest in the diagnosis of cardiac impairments in type 2 diabetics: lessons learned from a cross-sectional case series in Burkina Faso].,"Diabetes is a powerful independent cardiovascular risk factor. The aim of this study is to describe the electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities observed in patients with type 2 diabetes treated in the Department of Medicine at the University Hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso. We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study of all patients with type 2 diabetes who gave consent from April to September 2014. We gathered clinical data from all the patients. They, moreover, underwent electrocardiography and doppler echocardiography. A total of 155 diabetics were investigated. The average age of patients was 55 years (IQR: 47-64) with a female predominance (sex ratio 0.5). Electrocardiographic abnormalities included repolarization abnormalities (31%) and atrial rhythm disorders (16,12%). Echocardiographic examination showed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in 20,64% of cases. Left atrium was dilated in 14.19% of cases, LV was dilated in 1.3% of cases. Abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction was detected in 3.87% of cases. Nosological entities included hypertensive heart disease in 27 cases (54%), ischemic heart disease in 19 cases (38%), dilated cardiomyopathy in 2 cases (4%) and diabetic cardiomyopathy in 2 cases (4%). Heart failure was detected in 22 cases (44%) independently from cardiac impairment. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities are frequent in type 2 diabetes population at the University Hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso. Improved cooperation between cardiologists and diabetologists as well as the establishment of adequate technical screening equipment would be prerequisite for better cardiac risk stratification in this population.",2018,The Pan African medical journal
"Commonsense Explanations of Sparsity, Zipf Law, and Nashâ€™s Bargaining Solution","As econometric models become more and more accurate and more and more mathematically complex, they also become less and less intuitively clear and convincing. To make these models more convincing, it is desirable to supplement the corresponding mathematics with commonsense explanations. In this paper, we provide such explanation for three economics-related concepts: sparsity (as in LASSO), Zipfâ€™s Law, and Nashâ€™s bargaining solution. 1 Formulation of the Problem Need for commonsense explanations. In the 19 century, from Adam Smith through Karl Marx, economic phenomena were described by relatively simple intuitively clear formulas. However, it was well understood that these formulas provide, at best, a qualitative understanding, and qualitative predictions. Economics and finance are complex phenomena, so not surprisingly, simple models do not provide a good quantitative description of these phenomena. Starting with the 20 century, new models appeared that allow us, in many cases, to make reasonable accurate predictions. The corresponding models â€“ that more adequately describe economic and financial phenomena â€“ are often very mathematically complicated, far from common sense. And here lies a problem. Since models are complicated, requiring complex math beyond what most people know, people in general â€“ and politicians in particular â€“ do not fully trust these models. This lack of complete trust is understandable, since sometimes, predictions of previous models turn out to be wrong, and decisions based on these predictions made crisis situations worse. It",2020,
Radiomics prognostication model in glioblastoma using diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI,"We aimed to develop and validate a multiparametric MR radiomics model using conventional, diffusion-, and perfusion-weighted MR imaging for better prognostication in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. A total of 216 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were enrolled from two tertiary medical centers and divided into training (nâ€‰=â€‰158) and external validation sets (nâ€‰=â€‰58). Radiomic features were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging. After radiomic feature selection using LASSO regression, an individualized radiomic score was calculated. A multiparametric MR prognostic model was built using the radiomic score and clinical predictors. The results showed that the multiparametric MR prognostic model (radiomics score + clinical predictors) exhibited good discrimination (C-index, 0.74) and performed better than a conventional MR radiomics model (C-index, 0.65, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) or clinical predictors (C-index, 0.66; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). The multiparametric MR prognostic model also showed robustness in external validation (C-index, 0.70). Our results indicate that the incorporation of diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MR imaging into an MR radiomics model to improve prognostication in glioblastoma patients improved its performance over that achievable using clinical predictors alone.",2020,Scientific Reports
"Seroepidemiology of syphilis among men who have sex with men in Burkina Faso, West Africa","Men who have sex with men (MSM) have a disproportionate risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as syphilis. However, prevalence and determinants of syphilis among this population are less known in West Africa. This study aims to estimate syphilis prevalence among MSM in Burkina Faso. We conducted a cross-sectional biological and behavior survey in the two main cities of Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. MSM were recruited using Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) methods. Data were collected from January to April 2013 in Ouagadougou and from May to August 2013 in Bobo-Dioulasso. Out of the 657 MSM screened for syphilis, 6.1% (40/657) tested positive for Treponema pallidum antibodies and 1.1% (7/657) for active syphilis. Population-weighted prevalence of active syphilis was 2.1% (95% CI, 01.1â€“04.4) in Ouagadougou and 0.0% in Bobo-Dioulasso. Serologic markers of syphilis (anti-Treponema antibodies) were found among 7.4% (95% CI 5.0â€“10.8) of MSM in Ouagadougou and 5.0% (95% CI 3.1â€“8.0) in Bobo-Dioulasso. No significant differences were found in syphilis serological markers prevalence by participantsâ€™ sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. The prevalence of syphilis among MSM is low and comparable to that of other individuals of reproductive age in Burkina Faso. This low prevalence is very encouraging and suggests implementation of effective public health intervention programs which direct resources and services toward MSM to prevent further spread of syphilis infection and to limit HIV transmission in this group.",2019,European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases
The presence of left atrial posterior wall fibrillation despite restoration of sinus rhythm after posterior box ablation,"A 74-year-old woman was referred to the outpatientdepartment with a history of symptomatic persistent AFdespite receiving a maximal dose of dofetilide. Her othermedication included warfarin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin.There was no history of hypertension, coronary arterydisease, or obstructive sleep apnea. A previous trans-thoracic echocardiogram had been reported as demonstrat-ing a mildly dilated left atrium (LA) at 4.2 cm with normalleft ventricle (LV) systolic function (ejection fraction70%). A preoperative transesophageal echocardiogramshowed no evidence of clot in the left atrial appendagewith 4 PVs draining into the LA.

A 6F Lassovariable circular catheter (Biosense Webster) and anirrigated-tip mapping/ablationcatheter(FcurveThermoCoolIrrigated Tip Catheter SF, Biosense Webster) were intro-duced into the LA.Wide antral isolation of the left and right PVs wasperformed initially. Powers of 35â€“43W were usedanteriorlyand 25â€“30 W posteriorly in the LA. The patient remained inAF after all 4 PVs demonstrated isolation. The patient wassuccessfully cardioverted to sinus rhythm, following a singlesynchronized direct current shock of 150 J. All PVsremained isolated. However, AF recurred shortly aftercardioversion.

"Neural function, injury, and stroke subtype predict treatment gains after stroke.","OBJECTIVE
This study was undertaken to better understand the high variability in response seen when treating human subjects with restorative therapies poststroke. Preclinical studies suggest that neural function, neural injury, and clinical status each influence treatment gains; therefore, the current study hypothesized that a multivariate approach incorporating these 3 measures would have the greatest predictive value.


METHODS
Patients 3 to 6 months poststroke underwent a battery of assessments before receiving 3 weeks of standardized upper extremity robotic therapy. Candidate predictors included measures of brain injury (including to gray and white matter), neural function (cortical function and cortical connectivity), and clinical status (demographics/medical history, cognitive/mood, and impairment).


RESULTS
Among all 29 patients, predictors of treatment gains identified measures of brain injury (smaller corticospinal tract [CST] injury), cortical function (greater ipsilesional motor cortex [M1] activation), and cortical connectivity (greater interhemispheric M1-M1 connectivity). Multivariate modeling found that best prediction was achieved using both CST injury and M1-M1 connectivity (r(2) = 0.44, p = 0.002), a result confirmed using Lasso regression. A threshold was defined whereby no subject with >63% CST injury achieved clinically significant gains. Results differed according to stroke subtype; gains in patients with lacunar stroke were best predicted by a measure of intrahemispheric connectivity.


INTERPRETATION
Response to a restorative therapy after stroke is best predicted by a model that includes measures of both neural injury and function. Neuroimaging measures were the best predictors and may have an ascendant role in clinical decision making for poststroke rehabilitation, which remains largely reliant on behavioral assessments. Results differed across stroke subtypes, suggesting the utility of lesion-specific strategies.",2015,Annals of neurology
Solving constrained Lasso and Elastic Net using nu-SVMs,"Many important linear sparse models have at its core the Lasso problem, for which the GLMNet algorithm is often considered as the current state of the art. Recently M. Jaggi has observed that Constrained Lasso (CL) can be reduced to a SVM-like problem, which opens the way to use ecient SVM algorithms to solve CL. We will rene Jaggi's arguments to reduce CL as well as constrained Elastic Net to a Nearest Point Problem and show experimentally that the well known LIBSVM library results in a faster convergence than GLMNet for small problems and also, if properly adapted, for larger ones.",2015,
An \ell_1-oracle inequality for the Lasso in finite mixture of multivariate Gaussian regression models,"We consider a multivariate finite mixture of Gaussian regression models for high-dimensional data, where the number of covariates and the size of the response may be much larger than the sample size. We provide an $\ell_1$-oracle inequality satisfied by the Lasso estimator according to the Kullback-Leibler loss. This result is an extension of the $\ell_1$-oracle inequality established by Meynet in \cite{Meynet} in the multivariate case. We focus on the Lasso for its $\ell_1$-regularization properties rather than for the variable selection procedure, as it was done in Stadler in \cite{Stadler}.",2014,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Biomedical Informatics and Computational Biology for High-Throughput Data Analysis,"The last few years have witnessed the emergence of several high-throughput (HTP) platforms that are based on the evolution of omic science through transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. With the huge data accumulation, the informatics and computational methods have become essential to understand the complexity of biomedical data. We lunched the special issue to address the demand for statistical models, biological omic data analyses, and meta-analysis of biomarker for complex diseases. 
 
Statistical models are always important for the understanding of complex data; in this issue, Y. Liang et al. proposed a new adaptive L1/2 shooting regularization method for variable selection based on the Cox's proportional hazards mode. Simulation and the real gene expression dataset analysis showed that the method is more accurate for variable selection than Lasso and adaptive Lasso methods. L. Tian et al. employed a nonlinear model to analyze time course gene expression data. They firstly developed a method for estimating the parameters in the nonlinear model and then utilized the model to perform the significance analysis of individually differentially expressed genes and clustering analysis of a set of gene expression profiles. The simulation and real-life biological data analyses showed that their methods outperform some existing methods. 
 
For the application of bioinformatics tools, Z. E et al. analyzed the gene expression in rice leaf blades at different temperatures. They analyzed the next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets and characterized the transcription profiles of the samples in rice seedling leaf blades at 25Â°C and 30Â°C. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were applied to study the effect of the temperature. Finally, they observed that temperature markedly regulates several superfamilies of transcription factors, including bZIP, MYB, and WRKY. Chronobiology is a field of biology that studies biological rhythms. R. Lopes et al. reviewed the bioinformatics or computational systems biology methods, tools, and databases which are very helpful to the understanding of the patterns and biological rhythms found in living organisms and the review will benefit the community for the application of bioinformatics in their future researches. 
 
For the understanding of protein structure and structure-function relationship, two papers are selected in this issue. M. Shambhu et al. studied the surface accessibility of hydrophobic residues by considering their conservation score and knowledge of flanking regions. The accuracy of prediction is therefore improved. In the other work, D. Lu et al. applied molecular dynamics to investigate the effects of X-linked agammaglobulinaemia associated with amino acid mutations in pleckstrin homology (PH) domain on the binding of the domain with inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4). The mutations were then classified as â€œfunctional mutationsâ€, and â€œfolding mutations.â€ The result provided new insights into the biological function of the Btk-PH domain and related mutation-causing diseases. 
 
Finally, two works in this special issue are medical studies. The first is the work by B. Lv et al. They analyzed the 347 studies for the diagnostic value of tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and found that the northern hemisphere group in the TNF-Î± test has higher sensitivity and specificity than those of southern hemisphere group. The second medical study is an association study. Z. Liu et al. reported the significantly association of NCK2 with opiates addiction in African-origin men by a comprehensive analysis of a dataset from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE). They employed both SNP and gene based methods of analysis and identified a strong and significant association between a SNP in the NCK2 gene on chromosome 2 with opiates addiction in African-origin men.

Linear Regression with a Large Number of Weak Instruments using a Post-l 1-Penalized Estimator,"This paper proposes a new two stage least squares (2SLS) estimator which is consistent and asymptotically normal in the presence of many weak instruments and heteroskedasticity. The first stage consists of two components: first, an adaptive absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) that selects the instruments and second, an OLS regression with the selected regressors. This procedure is a post-l1-penalized estimator as proposed by Belloni and Chernozhukov (2010). The second stage uses an OLS regression with the fitted values from the post-l1-penalized regression of the first stage. The methodology exploits the model selection benefits of the adaptive LASSO and reduces the post-IV selection bias. More importantly, it provides a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator in a 2SLS framework in the presence of many weak instruments and heteroskedasticity, which is infeasible for the conventional 2SLS in this context. These results are driven by the fact that after the instrument selection stage the growth rate of the concentration parameter is higher than the growth rate of the number of instruments.",2011,
Diagnostic power of fecal calprotectin in inflammatory and functional intestinal disorders.,"We read with great interest the article by Caviglia and colleagues entitled â€˜Fecal calprotectin (FC) is an effectivediagnostictool thatdifferentiates inflammatoryfrom functional intestinaldisordersâ€™ inwhichthe investigators reported that FC appeared to be a reliable noninvasive biomarker of intestinal inflammation andmight be useful to improve the appropriateness of colonoscopy requests avoiding unnecessary investigations in patients with abdominal complaints [1]. However, we think that some points should be discussed. Calprotectin is a calcium-binding protein, which is foundmainly inhumanneutrophil granulocytes,monocytes and macrophages, as the authors stated. Previous studies showed that several medications such as statins, aspirin, and anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs could alter FClevels [2,3]. Inaddition,dietary supplements suchas vitamin D, zinc, and different kinds of probiotics can affect FC levels too [4,5]. Therefore, obesity and pregnancy are other potential confounding factors for FC levels, so these factors should be considered in study designandshouldbementioned in theirpaper [6,7].We believethat thesecontributingfactorshavetobestatedto provide reliable data. Another contributing factor for FC levels is sampling time. Lasson et al. suggested that there was a great variability in the concentrations of calprotectin in stool samples collected during a single day [8]. It was shown that the most appropriate time for collecting stool for analysis was from the first bowel movement in the morning. Therefore, the authors should mention the time of collecting the stool samples to provide normalization due to preventing pre-analytical errors. Single measurement of FC may not be sufficiently accurate to differentiate gastrointestinal conditions, and other markers such as leukocyte and platelet count, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, albumin, lactoferrin, and polymorphonuclear elastase may be required [9,10]. Clarifying above concerns will certainly provide a clearer picture to the readers.",2015,Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology

"Fifty years of semi-dwarf spring wheat breeding at CIMMYT: Grain yield progress in optimum, drought and heat stress environments","Abstract Grain yield progress over 50 years of spring wheat breeding at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) was determined in field trials conducted during five crop seasons (2013â€“2017) at Norman E. Borlaug research station near Ciudad Obregon, Mexico. The trials included 30 varieties (24 bread wheat and 6 durum wheat) released between 1965â€“2014 and were sown under managed optimum, drought, and heat stress conditions. The optimum irrigated environment had 3â€¯management systems, flat sowing with weekly drip irrigation (FDI), bed sowing with flood irrigation (BFI), and flat sowing with flood irrigation (FFI). The drought environment had 2 management systems, flat sowing with reduced irrigation (FRI) and flat sowing under severe drought stress (FSD). The heat stress environment was sown in beds (HFI) three months later than the normally sown irrigated and drought environments. The rate of grain yield progress was estimated relative to Sonalika released in 1965 and Mexicali C75 released in 1975 for bread and durum wheat, respectively. Grain yield progress per year for bread wheat was, 31.2â€¯kg haâˆ’1, 35.3â€¯kg haâˆ’1, and 24.7â€¯kg haâˆ’1 in irrigated environments FDI, BFI, and FFI, respectively. In the stress environments, bread wheat grain yield progress was estimated as 25.6â€¯kg haâˆ’1, 17.7â€¯kg haâˆ’1, and 18.1â€¯kg haâˆ’1 per year in FRI, FSD, and HFI, respectively. For durum wheat, the grain yield progress was estimated as 29.6â€¯kg haâˆ’1, 48.1â€¯kg haâˆ’1, 18.8â€¯kg haâˆ’1, and 29.8â€¯kg haâˆ’1, per year in FDI, BFI, FFI, and HFI, respectively. Trait linkage graph analysis using LASSO regularized graphical model estimated that biomass, harvest index, and grains per meter square (GNM) were linked to grain yield progress in all environments. Thousand kernel weight was associated with grain yield progress under optimum and heat stress conditions, whereas grain weight per tiller (GWT) associated with progress under drought. Results also show that the highest yielding varieties in each environment however, had different trait attributes, with some varieties having higher GNM and tillers per meter square compensating for low GWT, while others had high GWT to compensate for reduced GNM. In conclusion, CIMMYTâ€™s wheat breeding program has continued to show progress in grain yield in different environments/management systems, and while certain traits have consistently improved over the years, the varieties developed have employed different trait strategies to achieve final grain yield.",2020,Field Crops Research
Natural Language Processing for Automated Quantification of Brain Metastases Reported in Free-Text Radiology Reports.,"PURPOSE
Although the bulk of patient-generated health data are increasing exponentially, their use is impeded because most data come in unstructured format, namely as free-text clinical reports. A variety of natural language processing (NLP) methods have emerged to automate the processing of free text ranging from statistical to deep learning-based models; however, the optimal approach for medical text analysis remains to be determined. The aim of this study was to provide a head-to-head comparison of novel NLP techniques and inform future studies about their utility for automated medical text analysis.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Magnetic resonance imaging reports of patients with brain metastases treated in two tertiary centers were retrieved and manually annotated using a binary classification (single metastasis v two or more metastases). Multiple bag-of-words and sequence-based NLP models were developed and compared after randomly splitting the annotated reports into training and test sets in an 80:20 ratio.


RESULTS
A total of 1,479 radiology reports of patients diagnosed with brain metastases were retrieved. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model demonstrated the best overall performance on the hold-out test set with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.94), accuracy of 83% (95% CI, 80% to 87%), calibration intercept of -0.06 (95% CI, -0.14 to 0.01), and calibration slope of 1.06 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.17).


CONCLUSION
Among various NLP techniques, the bag-of-words approach combined with a LASSO regression model demonstrated the best overall performance in extracting binary outcomes from free-text clinical reports. This study provides a framework for the development of machine learning-based NLP models as well as a clinical vignette of patients diagnosed with brain metastases.",2019,JCO clinical cancer informatics
Surgical technique and clinical outcome of arthroscopic shoulder stabilization via suture anchors using the lasso-loop stitch.,During arthroscopic Bankart-repair the lasso-loop-stitch can be used. The clinical outcome of this technical modification to a broadly used procedure is not known. We followed-up 24 patients treated with this technique over 30 months. We found an excellent clinical outcome in 96% of all cases. The average Rowe-score was 96.3 points. The mean QuickDash was 2.8 points. Using the lasso-loop-stitch in arthroscopic Bankart-repair is safe and results in very good clinical outcomes. It might lead to an accentuated labral bump and enables secure knot-tying with knot-positioning away from the articular cartilage while avoiding the suture cutting through the tissue.,2018,Journal of orthopaedics
Model selection strategies for identifying most relevant covariates in homoscedastic linear models,"A new method in two variations for the identification of most relevant covariates in linear models with homoscedastic errors is proposed. In contrast to many known selection criteria, the method is based on an interpretable scaled quantity. This quantity measures a maximal relative error one makes by selecting covariates from a given set of all available covariates. The proposed model selection procedures rely on asymptotic normality of test statistics, and therefore normality of the errors in the regression model is not required. In a simulation study the performance of the suggested methods along with the performance of the standard model selection criteria AIC, BIC, Lasso and relaxed Lasso is examined. The simulation study illustrates the favorable performance of the proposed method as compared to the above reference criteria, especially when regression effects possess influence of several orders in magnitude. The accuracy of the normal approximation to the test statistics is also investigated; it has been already satisfactory for sample sizes 50 and 100. As an illustration the US college spending data from 1994 is analyzed.",2010,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Developing a dengue forecast model using machine learning: A case study in China,"BACKGROUND
In China, dengue remains an important public health issue with expanded areas and increased incidence recently. Accurate and timely forecasts of dengue incidence in China are still lacking. We aimed to use the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to develop an accurate predictive model of dengue.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Weekly dengue cases, Baidu search queries and climate factors (mean temperature, relative humidity and rainfall) during 2011-2014 in Guangdong were gathered. A dengue search index was constructed for developing the predictive models in combination with climate factors. The observed year and week were also included in the models to control for the long-term trend and seasonality. Several machine learning algorithms, including the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm, step-down linear regression model, gradient boosted regression tree algorithm (GBM), negative binomial regression model (NBM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) linear regression model and generalized additive model (GAM), were used as candidate models to predict dengue incidence. Performance and goodness of fit of the models were assessed using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and R-squared measures. The residuals of the models were examined using the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation function analyses to check the validity of the models. The models were further validated using dengue surveillance data from five other provinces. The epidemics during the last 12 weeks and the peak of the 2014 large outbreak were accurately forecasted by the SVR model selected by a cross-validation technique. Moreover, the SVR model had the consistently smallest prediction error rates for tracking the dynamics of dengue and forecasting the outbreaks in other areas in China.


CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE
The proposed SVR model achieved a superior performance in comparison with other forecasting techniques assessed in this study. The findings can help the government and community respond early to dengue epidemics.",2017,PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
Criteria for metrisability,"Abstract. A simple condition on the local bases of a first countable space is shownto imply metrisability, and some new and some well-known metrisation theorems arededuced. Weakening the condition gives new classes of spaces distinct from the classof metrisable spaces. 1. Introduction. It is the primary purpose of this paper to present a simplemetrisation theorem, give its elementary proof and deduce a number of othermetrisation theorems from it. The theorem isTheorem 1. In order that a Tx-space X be metrisable it is necessary and sufficientthat for each x in X, there be a countable decreasing local neighbourhood basis1 {W(n, x): n â€” 1,2,3,...} atxsatisfying (A) ifxEU and U is an open set, then there exist a positive integer s = s(x, U) and an open set V = V(x, U) containing x such that x E W(s, y) C U whenever y E V. We conclude by considering conditions weaker than (A) and give examples toshow that 'decreasing' cannot be omitted in the statement of Theorem 1. This gives aclass of first countable spaces, distinct from the metrisable spaces, in which everyseparable space is second countable.Throughout, x, y, z will denote elements of a space X, while i,j, m, n, r, s will beelements of the set N of positive integers. For A EX and a family G of subsets of X,St(A,G) will denote the union of those elements of G which meet A, and St(x, G)will denote St({x}, G). X is developable if it has a development, that is, a sequence{G(n): n E N} of open coverings of X such that, for each x, (St(x, G(n)): n E N} isa local basis at x. For A Q X,AÂ° will denote the interior of A,All spaces will satisfy the Tx separation axiom unless we specifically allowotherwise.2. Proof of Theorem 1. The proof of the following lemma is straightforward and isomitted. We shall not require (C) again until the next section, but place it here forconvenience.",1984,
IsoLasso: A LASSO Regression Approach to RNA-Seq Based Transcriptome Assembly - (Extended Abstract),"The new second generation sequencing technology revolu- tionizes many biology related research fields, and posts various compu- tational biology challenges. One of them is transcriptome assembly based on RNA-Seq data, which aims at reconstructing all full-length mRNA transcripts simultaneously from millions of short reads. In this paper, we consider three objectives in transcriptome assembly: the maximization of prediction accuracy, minimization of interpretation, and maximization of completeness. The first objective, the maximization of prediction ac- curacy, requires that the estimated expression levels based on assembled transcripts should be as close as possible to the observed ones for ev- ery expressed region of the genome. The minimization of interpretation follows the parsimony principle to seek as few transcripts in the pre- diction as possible. The third objective, the maximization of complete- ness, requires that the maximum number of mapped reads (or ""expressed segments"" in gene models) be explained by (i.e., contained in) the pre- dicted transcripts in the solution. Based on the above three objectives, we present IsoLasso, a new RNA-Seq based transcriptome assembly tool. IsoLasso is based on the well-known LASSO algorithm, a multivariate regression method designated to seek a balance between the maximiza- tion of prediction accuracy and the minimization of interpretation. By including some additional constraints in the quadratic program involved in LASSO, IsoLasso is able to make the set of assembled transcripts as complete as possible. Experiments on simulated and real RNA-Seq datasets show that IsoLasso achieves higher sensitivity and precision si- multaneously than the state-of-art transcript assembly tools.",2011,
Can Machines Learn Capital Structure,"Yes, they can! Machine learning models that exploit big data can consistently predict corporate leverage better than classical methods over time and identify its determinants. Using a large sample of U.S. firms from 1972 to 2018, we apply random forests, gradient boosting machines, neural networks, and generalized additive models to predict corporate leverage and the contributing factors. Results show that machine learning models that allow for nonlinearities and complex interactions boost the out-of-sample R-squared from 36% to 56% over linear methods such as LASSO. The superior predictive performance occurs every year of the out-of-sample period at the aggregate level as well as subsamples such as firms undergoing a major capital restructuring. Additionally, machine learning methods consistently identify the determinants of corporate leverage over time. Our best performing model, a random forest, selects market-to-book, industry median leverage, cash & equivalents, Z-Score, profitability, stock returns, and firm size as robust and reliable predictors of market leverage. These findings suggest that despite leverage climbing to record highs, firm fundamentals drive corporate leverage because the determinants and predictability of corporate leverage have remained stable.",2019,
Model Selection in Validation Sampling: an Asymptotic Likelihood-based Lasso Approach,"We propose an asymptotic likelihood-based LASSO approach for model selection in regression analysis when data are subject to validation sampling. The method makes use of an initial estimator of the regression coefficients and their asymptotic covariance matrix to form an asymptotic likelihood. This ``working'' objective function facilitates the formulation of the LASSO and the implementation of a fast algorithm. Our method circumvents the need to use a likelihood set-up that requires full distributional assumptions about the data. We show that the resulting estimator is consistent in model selection and that the method has lower prediction errors than a model that uses only the validation sample. Furthermore, we show that this formulation gives an optimal estimator in a certain sense. Extensive simulation studies are conducted for the linear regression model, the generalized linear regression model, and the Cox model. Our simulation results support our claims. The method is further applied to a dataset to illustrate its practical use.",2011,Statistica Sinica
Casual leading indicators detection for demand forecasting,"Demand forecasts are often univariate, or include only limited causal promotional information on a short-term horizon, which do not capture changing long-term global markets. More especially, including causal exogenous information in the forecasting models could enrich the long-term forecast. The limited historical data is typically used to both identify the current univariate structure and select the appropriate causal leading indicators from a large set of exogenous variables. A key challenge is to be able to distinguish between correlated and causal variables. The resulting variable selection problem is well studied in literature, but far from resolved. Furthermore, the problem gets harder by the limited available historical data in this context of business forecasting. The amount of historical sales observations is far less than the size of the pool of potential causal leading indicators. Methodologies from heuristics to shrinkage estimators, such as LASSO, are examined to overcome the variable selection problem. In a case study, we use real demand data from a global manufacturer and potential causal leading macro-economic indicators from the different global markets the manufacturer trades in.",2015,Eurosurveillance
Sexual conflict: males with highest mating success convey the lowest fertilization benefits to females,"In natural populations of a coral reef fish (the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum), males with the highest daily mating success produce the fewest sperm per mating, and this is reflected in significantly lower fertilization rates. The average amount released by males in pair-mating was 3.3 x 106 spermatozoa, resulting in a fertilization rate of 96%. Sperm released per spawn declined with increasing mating success, so that females mating with the most successful males had less than 93% of their eggs fertilized. It is unlikely that high mating-success males are physiologically incapable of increasing sperm production, because younger males with different mating strategies have absolutely larger testes and higher daily sperm output. Feeding experiments suggest that high-success males are diverting energy from gamete production to other fitness-enhancing activities such as mate guarding. Females incur the cost of low sperm release by having fewer of their eggs fertilized. There are no obvious compensatory benefits to females from mating with high-success males.",1995,Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences
Theoretical Properties of the Overlapping Groups Lasso,"We present two sets of theoretical results on the grouped lasso with overlap of Jacob, Obozinski and Vert (2009) in the linear regression setting. This method allows for joint selection of predictors in sparse regression, allowing for complex structured sparsity over the predictors encoded as a set of groups. This flexible framework suggests that arbitrarily complex structures can be encoded with an intricate set of groups. Our results show that this strategy results in unexpected theoretical consequences for the procedure. In particular, we give two sets of results: (1) finite sample bounds on prediction and estimation, and (2) asymptotic distribution and selection. Both sets of results give insight into the consequences of choosing an increasingly complex set of groups for the procedure, as well as what happens when the set of groups cannot recover the true sparsity pattern. Additionally, these results demonstrate the differences and similarities between the the grouped lasso procedure with and without overlapping groups. Our analysis shows the set of groups must be chosen with caution - an overly complex set of groups will damage the analysis.",2011,arXiv: Machine Learning
Design and Evaluation of Personalized Targeting Policies: Application to Free Trials,"Effectively targeting at scale is one of the most important problems that todayâ€™s firms face. We provide a three-pronged framework to design and evaluate personalized targeting policies that is compatible with a high-dimensional covariate space. First, we define the optimal policy design problem and describe two solution approaches â€“ (a) policy design using outcome estimates, and (b) policy design using CATE estimates. Second, we consider five outcome estimators (linear regression, lasso, CART, random forest, and XGBoost) and two CATE estimators (causal tree and causal forest) for this task. Third, we use the Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) estimator to evaluate the reward from any targeting policy offline. We apply our framework to data from a large-scale field experiment on free trials conducted by a leading SaaS firm, where new users were randomly assigned to 7, 14, or 30 days of free trial. Among the uniform targeting policies, the 7-days-for-all policy maximizes the subscription rate. Next, we design personalized targeting policies to optimize subscriptions. We find that policies based on the outcome estimators â€“ lasso and XGBoost â€“ offer the best performance. In contrast, policies based on the two CATE estimators â€“ causal tree and causal forest â€“ perform poorly because they are unable to personalize the policy sufficiently. We then link a methodâ€™s effectiveness in designing a policy with its ability to personalize the treatment sufficiently without overfitting (i.e., capture spurious heterogeneity). Finally, we show that policies designed to maximize short-run conversions also perform well on long-run outcomes such as consumer loyalty and profitability.",2019,
Signal Recovery under Cumulative Coherence,"This paper considers signal recovery in the framework of cumulative coherence. First, we show that the Lasso estimator and the Dantzig selector exhibit similar behavior under the cumulative coherence. Then we estimate the approximation equivalence between the Lasso and the Dantzig selector by calculating prediction loss difference under the condition of cumulative coherence. And we also prove that the cumulative coherence implies the restricted eigenvalue condition. Last, we illustrate the advantages of cumulative coherence condition for three class matrices, in terms of the recovery performance of sparse signals via extensive numerical experiments.",2019,J.

PP-111 A New Tool for Catheter Ablation: Lasso Electroporation Catheter,"The American Journal of Cardiology MARCH 26e29, 2015 11 IN AND C PP-111 A New Tool for Catheter Ablation: Lasso Electroporation Catheter.

Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Haydarpasa Hospital, Department Of Cardiology, Istanbul, Turkey; Siyami Ersek Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery Center Department of Cardiology, Istanbul, Turkey. Currently, radiofrequency (RF) energy is the most widely accepted and used method for arrythmia ablation. However, RF ablation has potential disadvantages such as endocardial disruption, charring, platelet activation and thrombus formation, Alternative energy sources have been proposed for catheter ablation. Cryoablation, microwave, laser and ultrasound may be able to create longer, deeper, and more controlled lesions. Irreversible electroporation is a nonthermal ablative tool that uses direct electrical pulses to create irreversible membrane pores and eventual cell death. At present there is no commercially avaiable cardiac eletroporation cathater. But limited animal studies utilizing modified standart ablation cathaters have been reported. Here we present design of a lasso electroporation cathater. Defibrillators are widely used to terminate life-threatening arrhythmias. If defibrillator shock-induced transmembrane potentials are large enough, they can cause irreversible tissue damage due to electroporation. We use 10-polar lasso cathater. Positive and negative poles of all electrode pairs were connected in parallel (Figure 1A). And we connected these poles to transcutaneous pacing patch. Direct current electricity transmitted to lasso cathater when we applied shock from defibrillator paddles to the transcutaneous pacing patch(Figure 1B). We test our cathater in saline solution. Whenever we applied shock, bubbles were seen around the electrode pairs which mean our lasso electroporation cathater is functioning properly(Figure 1C). To our knowledge this is the first lasso electroporation cathater reported in literature. We applied local ethic committee for further animal studies. Future studies will establish the efficacy of this new and promising technology.",2015,American Journal of Cardiology
Nitinol Flex Loop-assisted Retrieval and Sutureless Intrascleral Refixation of a Dislocated Intraocular Lens Implant.,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE
To describe a novel use of the flexible nitinol loop membrane scraper (FINESSE Flex loop; Alcon, Fort Worth, TX) for rescue and refixation of a dislocated intraocular lens (IOL).


METHODS
A 27-gauge nitinol flex loop was used to lasso each haptic of a dislocated 3-piece IOL. By retracting the loop, the haptic could be effectively locked to the instrument and externalized through a scleral tunnel, thereby fixating it to the sclera in a sutureless fashion.


RESULTS
A 50-year-old man presented with a posteriorly dislocated Sensar AR40e IOL (Abbott Medical Optics, Inc; Santa Barbara, CA) and retained lens material after a complicated cataract surgery in the left eye. His visual acuity was counting fingers at face. The patient underwent 27-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with successful rescue and refixation of the IOL using the nitinol flex loop. One week postoperatively, his visual acuity had improved to 20/40.


CONCLUSION
The nitinol flex loop may be used to lasso the haptics of a dislocated IOL and refixate it using a sutureless intrascleral fixation technique. This instrument may be a safer alternative compared with forceps for retrieving posteriorly dislocated IOLs that are sitting on the retinal surface.",2018,Retinal cases & brief reports
"Upper Jurassic (Portlandian) sedimentology and palynofacies of Cabo Espichel, Portugal","Upper Jurassic (Portlandian) strata on the southeastern margin of the Lusitanian Basin at Praia-do Cavalo, near Cabo Espichel, Portugal contain mixed carbonate and clastic sediments. From this section ten facies were identified to produce a model of Upper Jurassic shelf development on a passive Atlantic-type margin. -- The model consists of carbonate shelf and clastic deltaio sediments linked by erosional and non-erosional contacts. The shallow marginal marine carbonate sequence consists of intertidal and low energy and high energy subtidal environments. The clastic sequence consists of interdistributary bay fill, crevasse splay, levee, channel, distributary mouth bar and delta front environments. Non-erosional boundaries occur where levees, crevasse splays and bay fill prograde over shallow subtidal nodular limestones and calcareous shales. Erosional boundaries occur where distributary channels soour through distributary mouth bars and prodelta strata to sharply - rest upon lithified massive subtidal limestones. -- The miospore assemblage consists of 49 terrestrial and 4 marine species in samples dominated by Corollina (Classopollis), Exesipollenites and Spherioollenites. Three palynofacies are identified; the C. simplex palynofacies is associated with siliciclastic lithologies; C. itunensis palynofacies is restricted to the carbonates and; the marine palynomorph facies is characteristic of some carbonates and delta front siliciclastics. -- The C. simplex - sediment association indicates that this pollen was derived from a plant which occupied an inland marsh or levee environment. The C. itunensis - sediment association implies a plant living on or near a marginal marine carbonate coast resembling a â€œmangroveâ€ or saltmarsh environment.",1986,
Background Subtraction via Superpixel-Based Online Matrix Decomposition with Structured Foreground Constraints,"Background subtraction process plays a very essential role for various computer vision tasks. The process becomes more critical when the input scene contains variation of pixels such as swaying trees, rippling of water, illumination variations, etc. Recent methods of matrix decomposition into low-rank (e.g., corresponds to the background) and sparse (e.g., constitutes the moving objects) components such as Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), have been shown to be very efficient framework for background subtraction. However, when the size of the input data grows and due to the lack of sparsity-constraints, these methods cannot cope with the real-time challenges and always show a weak performance due to the erroneous foreground regions. In order to address the above mentioned issues, this paper presents a superpixel-based matrix decomposition method together with maximum norm (max-norm) regularizations and structured sparsity constraints. The low-rank component estimated from each homogeneous region is more perfect, reliable, and efficient, since each superpixel provides different characteristics with a reduced value of rank. Online max-norm based matrix decomposition is employed on each segmented superpixel to separate the low rank and initial outliers support. And then, the structured sparsity constraints such as the generalized fussed lasso (GFL) are adopted for exploiting structural information continuously as the foreground pixels are both spatially connected and sparse. We propose an online single unified optimization framework for detecting foreground and learning the background model simultaneously. Rigorous experimental evaluations on challenging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme in terms of both accuracy and computational time.",2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshop (ICCVW)
Recent patterns of European merger activity,"In this paper, Paul Geroski and Anastassios Vlassopoulos review recent European merger activity in the light of 1992, and draw two major conclusions. First, cross-border European mergers have increased over the last five years, adding up to nearly 30 per cent of the total number of mergers by European Community firms in 1988. Second, although the big British acquisitions are still taking place in America, UK firms have changed their behaviour in 1989, acquiring more European Community firms than American ones.",1990,Business Strategy Review
Solar power forecasting with sparse vector autoregression structures,"The strong growth that is felt at the level of photovoltaic (PV) power generation craves for more sophisticated and accurate forecasting methods that could be able to support its proper integration into the energy distribution network. Through the combination of the vector autoregression model (VAR) with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) framework, a set of sparse VAR structures can be obtained in order to capture the dynamic of the underlying system. The robust and efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), well known for its great ability dealing with high-dimensional data (scalability and fast convergence), is applied to fit the resulting LASSO-VAR variants. This spatial-temporal forecasting methodology has been tested, using 1-hour and 15-minutes resolution, for 44 microgeneration units time-series located in a city in Portugal. A comparison with the conventional autoregressive (AR) model is performed leading to an improvement up to 11%.",2017,2017 IEEE Manchester PowerTech
Locating Atrial Fibrillation Rotor and Focal Sources Using Iterative Navigation of Multipole Diagnostic Catheters,"PurposeMulti-polar diagnostic catheters are used to construct the 3D electro-anatomic mapping of the atrium during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedures; however, it remains unclear how to use the electrograms recorded by these catheters to locate AF-driving sites known as focal and rotor source types. The purpose of this study is to present the first algorithm to iteratively navigate a circular multi-polar catheter to locate AF focal and rotor sources without the need to map the entire atria.MethodsStarting from an initial location, the algorithm, which was blinded to the location and type of the AF source, iteratively advanced a Lasso catheter based on its electrogram characteristics. The algorithm stopped the catheter when it located of an AF source and identified the type. The efficiency of the algorithm is validated using a set of simulated focal and rotor-driven arrhythmias in fibrotic human 2D and 3D atrial tissue.ResultsOur study shows the feasibility of locating AF sources with a success rate of greater than 95.25% within average 7.56â€‰Â±â€‰2.28 placements independently of the initial position of the catheter and the source type.ConclusionsThe algorithm could play a critical role in clinical electrophysiology laboratories for mapping patient-specific ablation of AF sources located outside the pulmonary veins and improving the procedure success.",2019,Cardiovascular Engineering and Technology
"Communicative Activities in Community Ecotourism Projects in Kalimantan, Indonesia","Ecotourism, a term that first appeared in the 1970s to describe environmentally and culturally sustainable tourist activities (Honey, 2003), has become the fastest growing sector of the tourism industry, generating revenues between US$ 30 billion to US$ 1.2 trillion (West & Carrier, 2004). Numerous scholars have observed that the involvement of various industries, organisations, and communities demonstrate the complexities involved in ecotourism projects around the world (Honey, 1999, 2003; Patterson, 1997). Furthermore, the differences in social forces, governmental politics and regulations, marketing strategies, and accessibility shape the ways in which tourists, local communities, and national governments respond to the growing demand for ecotourism activities (Ceballos-Lascurain, 1996). These factors indicate a growing need to study the implications of ecotourism. Since ecotourism activities are primarily communicative events centred around educational programmes and centres, brochures and advertisements, and interpersonal communication between and among guides and tourists, understanding how such communication shapes experiences, reactions, and interactions is important for improving conservation efforts and relationships among various parties involved in ecotourism. In this essay, I outline some of the issues relating to ecotourism as a communicative-based activity in three national parks in Kalimantan, Indonesia, based on field research observations. Overview of Ecotourism Ecotourism is an often-used lay term to describe tourist activities that might include a number of outdoor activities, such as hunting, hiking, camping, fishing, boating, white water rafting, motor biking, or scuba diving (Buckley, 2004; Ceballos-Lascurain, 1996; Mosisch & Arthington, 2004; Warnken & Byrnes, 2004). However, numerous scholars have argued this broad conception of nature-based tourism does not encapsulate the original usage of the term. For example, Weaver offers the following definition of ecotourism as: a form of tourism that fosters learning experiences and appreciation of the natural environment, or some component thereof, within its associated cultural context. It has the appearance (in concert with best practice) of being environmentally and socio-culturally sustainable, preferably in a way that enhances the natural and cultural resource base of the destination and promotes the viability of the operation. (2001) Goals for ecotourism endeavours generally include: 1) to provide first-hand experience with nature; 2) to promote environmental consciousness; 3) to avoid environmental degradation; 4) to foster local community involvement in conservation efforts; 5) to create opportunities for local communities; 6) to generate awareness of local cultures, and ecosystems (adapted from Ceballos Lascurain, 1996; Honey, 1999, 2003; Weaver, 2001). These objectives of ecotourism demonstrate that ecotourist activities can have a positive effect for tourists, local communities, and conservation efforts if planned, implemented, and managed effectively (Buckley, 2004). Hector Ceballos-Lascurain observes ""True ecotourism can in fact be one of the most powerful tools for protecting the environment"" (1996). On the other hand, ecotourism also has its drawbacks. Ecotourism activities can cause waste management problems, environmental degradation, introduction of exotic species, rural sprawl, erosion of cultural values, conflict between local communities and ecotourists, and finally, diminished economic opportunities, such as revenue leakage (Buckley, 2004; ""Close encounters,"" 2004; Liddle, 1997; Pholpoke, 1998; Stem, Lassoie, Lee, Deshler & Schelhas, 2003; Weaver, 2001). For example, one study of ecotourism in Nepal reports that only 6 percent of 996 households surveyed earned income from activities relating directly or indirectly to ecotourism (Bookbinder, Dinerstein, Rijal, Cauley, & Rajouria, 1998). â€¦",2010,The Journal of development communication
2-D sparse autoregressive modeling for high resolution radar imaging,"ISAR imaging based on autoregressive (AR) model has not only spurious scattering centers but also high side lobes. Sparse AR models can be utilized for suppressing these. However, computational complexity of the BPDN with penalty sparsity approach which is employed to compute sparse AR model coefficients is high. In this work, the sparse AR model coefficients are computed by using BPDN and LASSO approaches which have less computational complexity. Spurious scattering centers and side lobes are successfully suppressed in the resulting radar images.",2016,2016 24th Signal Processing and Communication Application Conference (SIU)
Variable selection for sparse logistic regression,"We consider the variable selection problem in a sparse logistical regression model. Inspired by the square-root Lasso, we develop a weighted score Lasso for logistical regression. The new method yields the estimation $${\ell }_1$$ error bound under similar assumptions as introduced in Bach et al. (Electron J Stat 4:384â€“414, 2010). Compared to standard Lasso, the weighted score Lasso provides a direct choice for the tuning parameter. Both theoretical and simulation results confirm the satisfactory performance of the proposed method. We illustrate our methodology with a real microarray data set.",2020,Metrika

Prognostic modelling with logistic regression analysis: a comparison of selection and estimation methods in small data sets.,"Logistic regression analysis may well be used to develop a prognostic model for a dichotomous outcome. Especially when limited data are available, it is difficult to determine an appropriate selection of covariables for inclusion in such models. Also, predictions may be improved by applying some sort of shrinkage in the estimation of regression coefficients. In this study we compare the performance of several selection and shrinkage methods in small data sets of patients with acute myocardial infarction, where we aim to predict 30-day mortality. Selection methods included backward stepwise selection with significance levels alpha of 0.01, 0.05, 0. 157 (the AIC criterion) or 0.50, and the use of qualitative external information on the sign of regression coefficients in the model. Estimation methods included standard maximum likelihood, the use of a linear shrinkage factor, penalized maximum likelihood, the Lasso, or quantitative external information on univariable regression coefficients. We found that stepwise selection with a low alpha (for example, 0.05) led to a relatively poor model performance, when evaluated on independent data. Substantially better performance was obtained with full models with a limited number of important predictors, where regression coefficients were reduced with any of the shrinkage methods. Incorporation of external information for selection and estimation improved the stability and quality of the prognostic models. We therefore recommend shrinkage methods in full models including prespecified predictors and incorporation of external information, when prognostic models are constructed in small data sets.",2000,Statistics in medicine
Detection of multiple undocumented change-points using adaptive Lasso,"The problem of detecting multiple undocumented change-points in a historical temperature sequence with simple linear trend is formulated by a linear model. We apply adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) to estimate the number and locations of change-points. Model selection criteria are used to choose the Lasso smoothing parameter. As adaptive Lasso may overestimate the number of change-points, we perform post-selection on change-points detected by adaptive Lasso using multivariate t simultaneous confidence intervals. Our method is demonstrated on the annual temperature data (year: 1902â€“2000) from Tuscaloosa, Alabama.",2014,Journal of Applied Statistics

"Predispersal seed predation on three Vachellia species and one Senegalia species (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae) in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia and Menagesha forest, Ethiopia","This study on predispersal seed predation of the leguminous species Vachellia abyssinica (Hochst. Ex. Benth.) Kyal & Boatwr., Senegalia senegal (L.) Britton, Vachellia seyal (Del.) P.J.H. Hurter, and Vachellia tortilis (Forssk.) Galasso & Banfi was conducted around Lake Langano and Menagesha Forest in Ethiopia to identify the associated seed predators and determine their impact on seed germination. Eight seed beetles Bruchidius albosparsus (FÃ¥hraeus, 1839), B. aurivillii (Blanc, 1889), B. djemensis Decelle 1971, B. discoidalis (FÃ¥hraeus, 1839), B. sinaitus (K. Daniel, 1907), B. silaceus (FÃ¥hraeus, 1839), B. sp 411, B. simulans (Anton and Delobel, 2003), and one unidentified species of Cerambycidae were found associated with seeds of these Acacia species. These predators damaged less than 9% of seeds of these species, which exhibited lower germination. This study provides unrecorded lists of predispersal seed predators associated with seeds of Vachellia and Senegalia species in Ethiopia, and some associations are new. There is need to assess the distribution, abundance and effects of predispersal seed predators on other Vachellia, as well as other tree species.",2016,International Journal of Tropical Insect Science
"Consumption Rates, Evacuation Rates and Diets of Pygmy Killifish, Leptolucania ommata, and Mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis in the Okefenokee Swamp","I studied feeding dynamics of Leptolucania ommata and Gambusia affinis in the Okefenokee Swamp. Both fishes mainly ate insect larvae (such as Chironomidae) and Cladocera. Evacuation rates ranged from 0.143 (L. om mala in winter) to 0.279/hour (L. ommala in summer). Daily food consumption (dry weight) ranged from 24.2 (L. ommata in winter) to 148.3 mg/gjday (G. affinis in summer). Maximum consumption by both species was estimated at 26.31 mgt m/ day, in summer. These values are consistent with other observations supporting a hypothesis that invertebrate prey production is substantial in these blackwater wetlands. Relatively little is known about the diets and feeding dynamics of fishes of freshwater wetlands (Weller 1981). Studies of the diets of wetland fishes have concerned those in salt and estuarine marshes (e.g. Harrington and Harrington 1961, Wetzel 1971, Kjelson et al. 1975). I do not know of a previous study on consumption or evacuation rates of any fish in any saltwater or freshwater wetland. This study was based on field data from the Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia-Florida, the largest entirely freshwater wetland in the United States (1800 km 2). My objectives were to determine the diets and rates of consumption and evacuation under field conditions of two of the most abundant fishes in a marsh on the west side of the Okefenokee Swamp: that is marsh C, the ""Control"" marsh of Stinner (l983) and Oliver and Schoenberg (1989). To quantify dynamics at the ecosystem level and to estimate minimum invertebrate prey production, I then used measures of daily food consumption to estimate area-based consumption (consumption per m2) by these fish. These invertebrate prod uction estimates may help to resolve whether blackwater habitats have low secondary productivity, as suggested for tropical blackwaters (Janzen 1974, Fittkau et al. 1975, Araujo-Lima et al. 1986), or substantial productivity (Freeman and Freeman 1985). Methods are field-based to obviate elaborate laboratory feeding studies and to obtain data under natural conditions. I Present address: Bureau of Aquatic Plant Management, Florida Department of Natural Resources, 3917 Commonwealth Boulevard, Tallahassee, FL 32399. Brimleyana 17:89-103. December 1991 89 90 J. Douglas Oliver The two fishes examined were Leptolucania ommata Jordan, the pygmy killifish, and Gambusia affinis Baird and Girard, the mosquitofish, small members of the order Atheriniformes. Leptolucania ommata lives in quiet, densely vegetated fresh waters from southern Georgia and Alabama to Florida (McLane 1955, Laerm et al. 1980). Gambusia affinis is native from southern Illinois to Texas and Georgia, and it has been introduced to warm watets around much of the world, primarily to consume mosquito larvae (Hess and Tarzwell 1942, Krumholz 1948, Hurlbert and Mulla 1981). In marshes on the west side of the Okefenokee Swamp, L. ommata, G. affinis, Enneacan/hus gloriosus Holbrook, and Elassoma okefenokee Bohlke are by far the most numerous fishes (in that order at C and R sites, Oliver and Schoenberg 1989). The invididuals used in this study were adults that came within the common distributions of length (L. ommata of 13-20 mm, G. aJfinis of 15-25 mm standard length). Both species were studied in the field for a 24-hour period in the summer and in the winter. The study site is a subtropical marsh that has large daily temperature fluctuations. It lies approximately 200 m E of the entrance to the Suwannee River sill (an earthen dam that borders the west side of the Okefenokee Swamp). This blackwater area (mean depth 43-113 cm) had floating and submersed macrophytic vegetation (mainly Nuphar lu/eum and Utricularia spp.). Daily water temperature ranges were 4-20Â° C during winter observations, and 26-37Â°C during summer observations. The site differed from the Okefenokee LCP site of Freeman and Freeman (1985) in that the latter was shallower (10-55 cm) and was dominated by floating, submersed, and emergent macrophytes (Nymphaea odora/a, Eriocaulon compressum, and Rhynchospora inundata).",1991,
Probabilistic Inference on Multiple Normalized Genome-Wide Signal Profiles With Model Regularization,"Understanding genome-wide protein-DNA interaction signals forms the basis for further focused studies in gene regulation. In particular, the chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel DNA sequencing technology (ChIP-Seq) can enable us to measure the in vivo genome-wide occupancy of the DNA-binding protein of interest in a single run. Multiple ChIP-Seq runs thus inherent the potential for us to decipher the combinatorial occupancies of multiple DNA-binding proteins. To handle the genome-wide signal profiles from those multiple runs, we propose to integrate regularized regression functions (i.e., LASSO, Elastic Net, and Ridge Regression) into the well-established SignalRanker and FullSignalRanker frameworks, resulting in six additional probabilistic models for inference on multiple normalized genome-wide signal profiles. The corresponding model training algorithms are devised with computational complexity analysis. Comprehensive benchmarking is conducted to demonstrate and compare the performance of nine related probabilistic models on the ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets. The results indicate that the regularized SignalRanker models, in contrast to the original SignalRanker models, can demonstrate excellent inference performance comparable to the FullSignalRanker models with low model complexities and time complexities. Such a feature is especially valuable in the context of the rapidly growing genome-wide signal profile data in the recent years.",2017,IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience
Classification via group sparsity promoting regularization,"Recently a new classification assumption was proposed in [1]. It assumed that the training samples of a particular class approximately form a linear basis for any test sample belonging to that class. The classification algorithm in [1] was based on the idea that all the correlated training samples belonging to the correct class are used to represent the test sample. The Lasso regularization was proposed to select the representative training samples from the entire training set (consisting of all the training samples). Lasso however tends to select a single sample from a group of correlated training samples and thus does not promote the representation of the test sample in terms of all the training samples from the correct group. To overcome this problem, we propose two alternate regularization methods, Elastic Net and Sum-Over-l2-norm. Both these regularization methods favor the selection of multiple correlated training samples to represent the test sample. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our regularization methods give better recognition results compared to [1].",2009,"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing"
Lassoing and Reindeer Racing Versus â€˜Universalâ€™ Sports: Various Routes to SÃ¡mi Identity Through Sports,"Abstract 
Purpose â€“ This chapter explores how various types of sports provided by the Sami sport organisation in Norway (SVL-N) contribute to the construction of Sami ethnic identity. 
 
Design/methodology/approach â€“ Analysis of policy documents and literature of Sami sport, and field work into Sami sport contexts were conducted. Based on the theoretical framework of identity as a result of ethnic boundaries, the analysis focuses upon identity work within Sami contexts, compared with identity work across Sami and Norwegian contexts. 
 
Findings â€“ Both unique Sami sports, such as reindeer racing and lassoing, and â€˜universal sportâ€™, such as football and cross-country skiing, provide opportunities for the construction of ethnic identity. Identity work within Sami contexts focused on the internal cultural elements, while identity work in universal sports focused on the differences in comparison with Norwegian sport. However, refinements were revealed. 
 
Research limitations/implications â€“ The main limitation of this study is lack of empirical evidence provided by the athletes in Sami sports. 
 
Originality/value â€“ This chapter provides an overview of Sami sports and various approaches to ethnic identification through sport. The emphasis is on how a theoretical approach focusing on ethnic boundaries is supplemented by an approach acknowledging the cultural material within specific ethnic contexts.",2014,
Large-scale transcriptome sequencing reveals novel expression patterns for key sex-related genes in a sex-changing fish,"BackgroundTeleost fishes exhibit remarkably diverse and plastic sexual developmental patterns. One of the most astonishing is the rapid socially controlled female-to-male (protogynous) sex change observed in bluehead wrasses (Thalassoma bifasciatum). Such functional sex change is widespread in marine fishes, including species of commercial importance, yet its underlying molecular basis remains poorly explored.MethodsRNA sequencing was performed to characterize the transcriptomic profiles and identify genes exhibiting sex-biased expression in the brain (forebrain and midbrain) and gonads of bluehead wrasses. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis were carried out for the sex-biased genes in the gonad to detect global differences in gene products and genetic pathways between males and females.ResultsHere we report the first transcriptomic analysis for a protogynous fish. Expression comparison between males and females reveals a large set of genes with sex-biased expression in the gonad, but relatively few such sex-biased genes in the brain. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis suggested that ovaries are mainly enriched for metabolic processes and testes for signal transduction, particularly receptors of neurotransmitters and steroid hormones. When compared to other species, many genes previously implicated in male sex determination and differentiation pathways showed conservation in their gonadal expression patterns in bluehead wrasses. However, some critical female-pathway genes (e.g., rspo1 and wnt4b) exhibited unanticipated expression patterns. In the brain, gene expression patterns suggest that local neurosteroid production and signaling likely contribute to the sex differences observed.ConclusionsExpression patterns of key sex-related genes suggest that sex-changing fish predominantly use an evolutionarily conserved genetic toolkit, but that subtle variability in the standard sex-determination regulatory network likely contributes to sexual plasticity in these fish. This study not only provides the first molecular data on a system ideally suited to explore the molecular basis of sexual plasticity and tissue re-engineering, but also sheds some light on the evolution of diverse sex determination and differentiation systems.",2015,Biology of Sex Differences
Soils and Native Vegetation in a Hilly and Mountainous Area in Central Greece,"Soils and native vegetation were investigated in 24 sites in the hilly and mountainous province of Elassona, central Greece. Most soils consist of coarse alluvial material that originated from the weathering of hard limestone or schist. Mostly are acidic, and the coarse texture enhances the leaching of exchangeable cations. Mean soil organic matter is greater than values recorded in the lowlands. Low content of available phosphorous (P) was observed in certain soils, and this may be attributed either to P fixation in the clay minerals or to parent material. Copper (Cu) content was low in 11 samples, and the content of exchangeable calcium (Ca++) was lower than the critical level in two thirds of samples. Similarly, low values were recorded for exchangeable magnesium (Mg++) and potassium (K+). Results from annual plants have shown low nitrogen (N) content and partial deficiency in Ca, K, and Mg, which reflects the particular soil and climatic conditions. Furthermore, in certain samples Cu, manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) were found at deficiency levels. Samples from perennial plants were selected from sites where vegetation was degraded. Results revealed nitrogen (N), Mn, and Cu deficiency, and the values for micronutrients iron (Fe), Zn, and boron (B) were greater than critical levels. Practices and measures are suggested to improve soils and to restore the degraded vegetation, such as application of lime material in the acidic soil for correction of pH, rational water management, cultivation of crops with low water requirements, banning of overgrazing in areas vulnerable to erosion, winter cover of slopes with pasture and fodder crops, establishment of permanent shrubs, reforestation of certain hilly and mountainous areas, and training of farmers. Findings of this study can assist local authorities in managing natural resources in a more rational and sustainable manner. Establishment of pasturelands in combination with rational grazing management should be of high priority to sustain livestock production.",2011,Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis
A New Variable Selection Approach Inspired by Supersaturated Designs Given a Large-Dimensional Dataset,"The problem of variable selection is fundamental to statistical modelling in diverse fields of sciences. In this paper, we study in particular the problem of selecting important variables in regression problems in the case where observations and labels of a real-world dataset are available. At first, we examine the performance of several existing statistical methods for analyzing a real large trauma dataset which consists of 7000 observations and 70 factors, that include demographic, transport and intrahospital data. The statistical methods employed in this work are the nonconcave penalized likelihood methods (SCAD, LASSO, and Hard), the generalized linear logistic regression, and the best subset variable selection (with AIC and BIC), used to detect possible risk factors of death. Supersaturated designs (SSDs) are a large class of factorial designs which can be used for screening out the important factors from a large set of potentially active variables. This paper presents a new variable selection approach inspired by supersaturated designs given a dataset of observations. The merits and the effectiveness of this approach for identifying important variables in observational studies are evaluated by considering several two-levels supersaturated designs, and a variety of different statistical models with respect to the combinations of factors and the number of observations. The derived results are encouraging since the alternative approach using supersaturated designs provided specific information that are logical and consistent with the medical experience, which may also assist as guidelines for trauma management.",2014,Journal of data science
