Natural Language or Not (NLoN) - A Package for Software Engineering Text Analysis Pipeline,"The use of natural language processing (NLP) is gaining popularity in software engineering. In order to correctly perform NLP, we must pre-process the textual information to separate natural language from other information, such as log messages, that are often part of the communication in software engineering. We present a simple approach for classifying whether some textual input is natural language or not. Although our NLoN package relies on only 11 language features and character tri-grams, we are able to achieve an area under the ROC curve performances between 0.976-0.987 on three different data sources, with Lasso regression from Glmnet as our learner and two human raters for providing ground truth. Cross-source prediction performance is lower and has more fluctuation with top ROC performances from 0.913 to 0.980. Compared with prior work, our approach offers similar performance but is considerably more lightweight, making it easier to apply in software engineering text mining pipelines. Our source code and data are provided as an R-package for further improvements.",2018,2018 IEEE/ACM 15th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR)
Development of a preprocedure nomogram for predicting contrast-induced acute kidney injury after coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention,"Most of the risk models for predicting contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) are available for postcontrast exposure prediction, thus have limited values in practice. We aimed to develop a novel nomogram based on preprocedural features for early prediction of CI-AKI in patients after coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 245 patients were retrospectively reviewed from January 2015 to January 2017. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression model was applied to select most strong predictors for CI-AKI. The CI-AKI risk score was calculated for each patient as a linear combination of selected predictors that were weighted by their respective coefficients. The discrimination of nomogram was assessed by C-statistic. The occurrence of CI-AKI was 13.9% (34 out of 245). We identified ten predictors including sex, diabetes mellitus, lactate dehydrogenase level, C-reactive protein, years since drinking, chronic kidney disease (CKD), stage of CKD, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and systolic blood pressure. The CI-AKI prediction nomogram obtained good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.718, 95%CI: 0.637-0.800, p = 7.23 Ã— 10-5). The cutoff value of CI-AKI risk score was -1.953. Accordingly, the novel nomogram we developed is a simple and accurate tool for preprocedural prediction of CI-AKI in patients undergoing CAG or PCI.",2017,Oncotarget
Trematode Life Cycles Involving Wild Mammals of Northwestern North America,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the trematode life cycles involving wild mammals of Northwestern North America. It describes five life cycles of trematodes of wild mammals, all of which involve changing hosts in fast-running water. Nanophyetus salmincola, adult in dogs, coyotes, and mink, develops to microcercous creeping cercariae in Oxytrema silicula (Pleroceridae) and emerges into the stream, producing copious masses of thick mucus upon which the cercariae cling. Acanthatrium oregonense and Allassogonoporus marginalis develop in either Oxytrema silicula or Flumenicola virens. Two heterophyid life cycles are similar, but with an interesting alternate reduction in hosts required in one. Euryhelmis squamula in Oregon has been found in Mustela vison. The snail host is the nearly microscopic Bythinella hemphilli found only in quiet seepage areas near fast cold streams.",1966,
B-spline curve fitting with invasive weed optimization,"Abstract B-spline curves and surfaces are generally used in computer aided design (CAD), data visualization, virtual reality, surface modeling and many other fields. Especially, data fitting with B-splines is a challenging problem in reverse engineering. In addition to this, B-splines are the most preferred approximating curve because they are very flexible and have powerful mathematical properties and, can represent a large variety of shapes efficiently [1] . The selection of the knots in B-spline approximation has an important and considerable effect on the behavior of the final approximation. Recently, in literature, there has been a considerable attention paid to employing algorithms inspired by natural processes or events to solve optimization problems such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization. Invasive weed optimization (IWO) is a novel optimization method inspired from ecological events and is a phenomenon used in agriculture. In this paper, optimal knots are selected for B-spline curve fitting through invasive weed optimization method. Test functions which are selected from the literature are used to measure performance. Results are compared with other approaches used in B-spline curve fitting such as Lasso, particle swarm optimization, the improved clustering algorithm, genetic algorithms and artificial immune system. The experimental results illustrate that results from IWO are generally better than results from other methods.",2017,Applied Mathematical Modelling
Temperature-Accelerated Dynamics Approach,"Acceleratedmoleculardynamics(AMD)isaclassofMD-basedmethodsused to simulate atomistic systems in which the metastable state-to-state evolution is slow compared with thermal vibrations. Temperature-accelerated dynamics (TAD) is a particularly efficient AMD procedure in which the predicted evolution is hastened by elevating the temperature of the system and then recovering the correct state-to-state dynamics at the temperature of interest. TAD has been used to study various materials applications, often revealing surprising behavior beyond the reach of direct MD. This success has inspired several algorithmic performance enhancements, as well as the analysis of its mathematical framework. Recently, these enhancements have leveraged parallel programming techniques to enhance both the spatial and temporal scaling of the traditional approach. We review the ongoing evolution of the modern TAD method and introduce the latest development: speculatively parallel TAD.",2016,
Study on the Sparse Sub-block Microwave Imaging Based on Lasso,"Sparse microwave imaging requires a nonlinear algorithm that is expensive for large scene imaging. Therefore, the sub-block imaging method, in which the measured data and the relative imaging region are divided into sub-blocks, is studied. Then, a sparse microwave imaging algorithm based on the Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) is performed on each sub-block. Finally, the sub-blocks are combined to obtain the whole image of the large scene. When compared with the overall reconstruction of the sparse scene, the sub-block algorithm can control the amount of data involved in each reconstruction, thereby avoiding frequent accessing of the disk by the signal processor, which is time consuming. Further, the theoretical analysis illustrates that the sub-block sparse imaging method is also accurate and stable, and the associated reconstruction error is no more than two times that of the overall reconstruction. The simulation and real data processing results support the validity of our method.",2013,
"Rapporti di dipendenza e ideologia funeraria. Lâ€™ushebty, immagine al contempo dello schiavo e del padrone","The author re-examines the concept of the shabti as a â€˜slaveâ€™ as formulated by Jaroslav Cerny and developed by Hans Schneider. He begins by proposing a definition of slavery based on the work of Claude Mcillassoux; a slave system (esclavagisme) is one in which labour is reproduced by â€˜acquisitionâ€™ from the outside. Within this perspective, he discusses some peculiarities of Egyptian â€˜slaveryâ€™. Then he proceeds to reconsider the notion that, in the course of the New Kingdom, shabits came to be identified with slaves, and this resulted in their â€˜depersonalizationâ€™, reflected especially in the â€˜anonymousâ€™ mass of shabits per individual found in the Third Intermediate Period. His conclusions are the following. Shabits probably remained images of the deceased throughout their history. The main evidence for this is their iconography and the fact that the deceseadâ€™s name and titles were inscribed upon them. Schneiderâ€™s claim that this inscription eventually became the ownerâ€™s brand is hardly plausible. The identification of shabits with slaves was not the result of a transition from their identification with household members (relatives and/or â€˜individual servantsâ€™), as shabits are called slaves (á¸¥mw) from the very beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and the notion of â€˜individual servantâ€™ as opposed to â€˜slaveâ€™ is a misconception. If the shabti was indeed a substitute or representative of a relative ( a proposition based on the sole, albeit significant evidence of the inscriptions on three stick-shabits), a threefold identification of the shabit must be deduced: image of the master, of his or her slave, and of his or her relative as well. The clause of the book Found at the Neck of King Wesermaatra in the Necropolis, â€˜they were all his male and female slaves of when he was on earth, it is he who has bought themâ€™, while not a sign of the â€˜reduction into slaveryâ€™ of the shabti (a much earlier conception), is possibly a reflection of the fact that purchase, as opposed to assignment of war captives by the State, had become the typical way of procuring slaves. As to the documents referring to the sale of shabits (the Decree for the Shabits of Neskhons and BM 10800), they have some specific characteristics that set them apart from contracts for the sale of slaves (of which only examples of later date are known), notably the magical role of the guarantee of the craftsman that the shabti will perform its duty in the hereafter. Thus, they belong to the ideological sphere of funerary beliefs, and can hardly be interpreted as a mere transposition to the divine domain of customs and practices of the world of the living.",1997,

Whole blood EBV-DNA: A surrogate for immune dysfunction in aggressive lymphoma?,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a -herpesviruses, is found in over 90% of adults, where it persists within a small subset of benign B cells [1]. Host EBV-specific T cell immunity is critical in maintaining the virus in a quiescent (latent) state. EBV associated lymphomas include endemic Burkitt lymphoma, 40% of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and 100% of HIV-associated HL, the majority of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphomas, approximately half of systemic and nearly all central nervous system post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders and a small sub-set of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [2â€“4]. Current efforts aim to improve treatment efficacy while reducing treatment-related toxicities and for this it is critical to develop biomarkers that reliably predict treatment response. In this context there have been numerous investigations into the role of EBV-DNA in the setting of EBV-associated lymphomas. These indicate that cell-free (serum/plasma) but not cellassociated EBV-DNA is a highly specific circulating biomarker [5â€“8]. Here, the virus is present in an unencapsulated (i.e. â€˜nakedâ€™) state, consistent with release of latent virus from apoptotic EBV-positive lymphoma cells [9]. In the current issue of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Tisi et al. [10] take these findings one step further, by presenting data on the predictive role of circulating whole blood (WB) EBV-DNA in DLBCL. Two hundred and eighteen HIV-negative patients with DLBCL were included for WB testing (positive in 54), with survival data following R-CHOP immuno-chemotherapy available in 179. Intriguingly, the authors observed that detectable WB EBV-DNA was associated with shorter progression-free and overall survival. Closer inspection of the cohort gives some insight as to why this might be so. Not only did WB EBV-DNA positive patients show significantly higher levels of antibody titers against EBV, but positive associations with Hepatitis C virus serology and age were also observed. This suggests heightened host immune compromise in WB EBV-DNA positive patients and is consistent with emerging evidence of the importance of host immunity as a prognostic indicator. Reports have implicated immunosenescence in impairing EBV-specific CD8 T cell immunity, in the pathogenesis EBV-positive DLBCL of the elderly [11â€“13]. However, this is at odds with recent data demonstrating that EBV-positive DLBCL is not restricted to those above the age of 50 years [14,15]. A key question raised by this study (â€˜â€˜is EBV-DNA a prognosticator irrespective of EBV-tissue status?â€™â€™) remains unanswered. This is because EBV encoded RNA in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH) was performed in only 52 cases. Here, EBV +DLBCL was present in nine patients. With such small numbers no definitive conclusions regarding the role of circulating EBV-DNA in EBV vs EBV DLBCL can be drawn. Furthermore, the relatively high proportion (17%) of EBVDLBCL cases most likely represents a selection bias, i.e. that EBER-ISH testing was reserved for cases that were felt more likely to be positive based on clinicohistopathological features. No association was found between EBV testing in blood fractions (plasma and mononuclear cells), but EBV-DNA with performed in only a minority of cases, making conclusions here difficult (WB EBV-DNA showed a modest association with the mononuclear fraction, but not plasma). Although the study has limitations, the authors are to be commended for making an important contribution to current knowledge. They show the importance of WB EBV-DNA at diagnosis as a poor prognostic indicator for patients with DLBCL, a finding that may be independent",2016,Leukemia & lymphoma
"Correlation between water quality and seagrass distribution along intertidal zone in Sarangani Province, Philippines","This study aimed to determine the correlation between certain properties of water quality and the distribution of seagrasses in the coastal areas of Glan and Maasim, Sarangani Province. Both sites have no previous correlation studies. At each site, three 50m transects were laid perpendicular to the shore with each transect having 11 quadrats at 5m intervals. Six species of seagrass were identified throughout the study. The most dominant species in Glan was Halodule pinifolia while in Maasim, the most dominant was Enhalus acoroides. Water samples were taken in each quadrat using vials. Salinity was measured using Atago refractometer. Temperature and pH were simultaneously measured using a HM Digital pH meter. Turbidity was observed visually. Correlation was analyzed using the statistic tool Pearsonâ€™s correlation through PAST software. The correlation analysis in Glan yielded a negative correlation of -0.99915 between salinity and seagrass distribution, implying an unhealthy fluctuation of salinity in the area which can harm seagrass. pH resulted in 0.99916 and temperature in 0.76758. In Maasim, the analysis yielded positive correlations in all physicochemical properties. 0.4342 for pH, 0.4342 for temperature, and 0.93193 for salinity. Overall, the results indicate generally healthy seagrass beds which means they are in a generally healthy marine environment. Researchers strongly recommend a more extensive study on the correlation of physicochemical properties with seagrasses along Sarangani Bay. *Corresponding Author: Nidelli S. Vinson ï€ª nidelliv@gmail.com Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences (JBES) ISSN: 2220-6663 (Print) 2222-3045 (Online) Vol. 8, No. 5, p. 30-35, 2016 http://www.innspub.net J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2016 31 | Vinson et al. Introduction Seagrasses are marine flowering plants widely distributed along temperate and tropical coastlines of the world (Short et al, 2007) that evolved from terrestrial plants. They are classified into four unrelated families of 50 to 60 species. Philippines is the second highest in seagrass diversity in the whole world, Australia being the first. Nineteen species or about fifty-five percent of the number of East Asian species can be found in the Philippines, seven of which are in Ulugan Bay, Palawan. Seagrass communities are considered the most important shallow marine ecosystems to humans (Green et al, 2003). In fact, people have utilized seagrasses for over 10,000 years now. Potentially, they can be used as bio-filters for sewage, coastal stabilizers, for paper manufacturing, as source of useful chemical fertilizer and fodder, and even as food and medicine for people (Fortes, 1990). Aside from these, seagrasses play key ecological roles in coastal ecosystems. They also form extensive meadows that can support high biodiversity. Also, seagrass productivity is as high as the best agricultural crops (Fortes, 1990). They are an important food source for many marine animals such as sea cows (dugong) and sea turtles (Green et al, 2003). They also serve as habitats and nurseries of many invertebrates, fishes, and mammals. Seagrasses also contribute to the stabilizaton of the ocean bottom, like how grasses stabilize the soil to prevent soil erosion. They also improve water quality by trapping fine sediments in the water (Green et al, 2003). One of the great importance of seagrass communities is their being useful indicators of environmental health as they are generally susceptible to changes in water quality and environmental quality and they respond in a manner that allows them to be measured and monitored. The vital factors for maintaining seagrass community health are sediment quality and depth, water quality (temperature, salinity, clarity), current and hydrodynamic processes, and species interactions (McKenzie, 2007). This study aimed to assess the health of the marine environment along Sarangani Bay through the assessment of the health of its seagrass communities by determining the correlation or association between water quality and the seagrass distribution or cover. Material and methods Study sites The study was conducted on the first two weeks of November 2015 in two sites: 1) Morales Beach, Binoni, Glan, Sarangani Province, Philippines and 2) Susanâ€™s Beach, Tinoto, Maasim, Sarangani Province, Philippines located between 05â—¦46â€™66.1â€N and 125â—¦11â€™17.2â€E, and 05â—¦52â€™43.79â€ and 125â—¦05â€™04.58â€, respectively. The areas, shown in Figure 1, are popular sites of study among seagrass researchers due to their abundance and diversity in these areas. Establishment of sampling sites At each site, three 50 m (perpendicular to the shore) transects were laid. Each transect was distanced 25 m from another. Eleven 1m Ã— 1m quadrats were laid in every five meters of each transect. Assessment of water quality Water samples were collected in each quadrat in each transect using a vial. Salinity was measured using an Atago refractometer. Temperature and pH were simultaneously measured using HM Digital pH meter. Turbidity was visually observed. Estimation of seagrass percent cover and identification of seagrass species Seagrass percent cover was estimated and species were identified using a guide provided by the Environment Conservation and Protection Center Alabel. The percent cover of each species identified in situ in each quadrat was also estimated using the same guide. Other organisms such as macroalgae, sea cucumbers, molluscs, and et cetera found in the quadrats were also noted. Photographs were taken using a digital camera, Nikon CoolPix AW130, for documentation. J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2016 32 | Vinson et al. Fig. 1. Location of study sites Morales Beach, Benoni, Glan and Susanâ€™s Beach, Tinoto, Maasim, Sarangani Province, Philippines. (Fig. 1A. Philippines; Fig. 1B. Mindanao; Fig. 1C. Sarangani Bay; Fig. 1D. Susanâ€™s Beach, Maasim; Fig. 1E. Morales Beach, Glan). Correlation analysis The correlation between water quality and the distribution of seagrasses was analysed using the statistical tool Pearsonâ€™s correlation through the PAST software. Results and discussion Table 1 shows the results of the assessment of the water quality and Table 2 shows the average percent cover of seagrasses in Glan and Maasim. Results of the assessment of the water quality show values that fall within the range of the standard values provided by the DENR Region XII. Seagrasses can tolerate considerable short-term salinity fluctuations. Although seagrasses may tolerate lowered salinities, the photosynthetic rate in seagrasses is affected by changes in salinity. A decrease in salinity carries a corresponding decrease in the photosynthetic rate (Thomas et al, 1961). Glan and Maasim are both in an optimum salinity range thus the presence of seagrasses in these areas. Turbidity has always been found to affect seagrasses. Elevated turbidity limits light from reaching the leaves for photosynthetic processes which will decrease seagrass productivity. In addition, the decline of seagrass populations during increased turbidity event can also be explained by the shedding of old shoots (resulting in reduced percentage cover) (Ahmadâ€Kamil et al, 2013). Maasim has very clear waters and thus has higher seagrass percent cover than Glan which had waters with many suspended solids. Factors that may have contributed to this increase in turbidity are siltation (de Jesus et al, 2001) and algal bloom. pH also affects seagrass photosynthesis. Lowered seawater pH will increase seagrass production. Maasim with pH of 6.4 had an average percent cover of 25.15% and Glan with pH of 7.9 had an average percent cover of 16.12%. Maasim has far lower pH compared to Glan and thus has far greater cover of seagrass. J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2016 33 | Vinson et al. Table 1.

However, Glan showed greater diversity. There was a greater number of species identified in Glan compared to the number of those in Maasim. The total of 6 species identified in both sites are listed in Table 3, including those identified outside the transects. In the sampling site in Glan, the most dominant species was Halodule pinifolia, followed by Cymodocea rotundata. In Maasim, Enhalus acoroides was the most dominant, followed by Cymodocea rotundata.

A plea for taking all available clinical information into account when assessing the predictive value of omics data,"BackgroundOmics data can be very informative in survival analysis and may improve the prognostic ability of classical models based on clinical risk factors for various diseases, for example breast cancer. Recent research has focused on integrating omics and clinical data, yet has often ignored the need for appropriate model building for clinical variables. Medical literature on classical prognostic scores, as well as biostatistical literature on appropriate model selection strategies for low dimensional (clinical) data, are often ignored in the context of omics research. The goal of this paper is to fill this methodological gap by investigating the added predictive value of gene expression data for models using varying amounts of clinical information.MethodsWe analyze two data sets from the field of survival prognosis of breast cancer patients. First, we construct several proportional hazards prediction models using varying amounts of clinical information based on established medical knowledge. These models are then used as a starting point (i.e. included as a clinical offset) for identifying informative gene expression variables using resampling procedures and penalized regression approaches (model based boosting and the LASSO). In order to assess the added predictive value of the gene signatures, measures of prediction accuracy and separation are examined on a validation data set for the clinical models and the models that combine the two sources of information.ResultsFor one data set, we do not find any substantial added predictive value of the omics data when compared to clinical models. On the second data set, we identify a noticeable added predictive value, however only for scenarios where little or no clinical information is included in the modeling process. We find that including more clinical information can lead to a smaller number of selected omics predictors.ConclusionsNew research using omics data should include all available established medical knowledge in order to allow an adequate evaluation of the added predictive value of omics data. Including all relevant clinical information in the analysis might also lead to more parsimonious models. The developed procedure to assess the predictive value of the omics data can be readily applied to other scenarios.",2019,BMC Medical Research Methodology
Parallelization with Multiplicative Algorithms for Big Data Mining,"We propose a nontrivial strategy to parallelize a series of data mining and machine learning problems, including 1-class and 2-class support vector machines, nonnegative least square problems, and $\ell_1$ regularized regression (LASSO) problems.

We provide rigorous analysis of the correctness and convergence of the algorithm. We demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our algorithms in comparison with other current leading algorithms.",2012,2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Data Mining

Design method of sparse frequency-deviation-free linear phase FIR (finite impulse response) notch filter,"The invention creatively provides a design method of a sparse frequency-deviation-free linear phase FIR (finite impulse response) notch filter. The design method includes determining quantity and position of nonzero tap coefficients of a required filter according to an LASSO algorithm, and then calculating values of the coefficients by means of the least square algorithm. Owning to sparsity of the filter, the quantity of adders and multipliers used for the filter can be reduced, and calculation speed of the filter is increased while calculation error and energy consumption thereof are decreased. According to simulation results, on the condition of the same design index, the linear phase FIR notch filter has the advantages that the nonzero tap coefficient quantity thereof is reduced by at least 15% and frequency deviation is avoided as compared with the like filters designed by the optimum design method at home and abroad.",2012,
Urban Sheep Keeping in West Africa: Can Socioeconomic Household Profiles Explain Management and Productivity?,"Rapid urbanization in Africa leads to a spatial concentration of people with different cultural origins and socioeconomic backgrounds resulting in a great diversity of life styles and livelihood strategies. One common strategy in Maroua/Cameroon and Bobo-Dioulasso/Burkina Faso is urban sheep keeping. Cluster analyses identified distinct socioeconomic groups with similarities between the towns: traditional livestock keepers, households headed by well educated government employees or traders, and more vulnerable groups formed of households headed by females, retired people or people with limited formal education. The household types in Bobo varied in their perception of the importance and the development of urban sheep keeping and their future plans. Those in Maroua differed in management intensity and in the potential to adapt their practices to the urban environment. Development interventions to reduce environmental pollution and risks for human health associated with urban sheep keeping need to account for these differences in the target group.",2006,Human Ecology
Statistical Inference with Ensemble of Clustered Desparsified Lasso,"Medical imaging involves high-dimensional data, yet their acquisition is obtained for limited samples. Multivariate predictive models have become popular in the last decades to fit some external variables from imaging data, and standard algorithms yield point estimates of the model parameters. It is however challenging to attribute confidence to these parameter estimates, which makes solutions hardly trustworthy. In this paper we present a new algorithm that assesses parameters statistical significance and that can scale even when the number of predictors p $\ge$ 10^5 is much higher than the number of samples n $\le$ 10^3 , by lever-aging structure among features. Our algorithm combines three main ingredients: a powerful inference procedure for linear models --the so-called Desparsified Lasso-- feature clustering and an ensembling step. We first establish that Desparsified Lasso alone cannot handle n p regimes; then we demonstrate that the combination of clustering and ensembling provides an accurate solution, whose specificity is controlled. We also demonstrate stability improvements on two neuroimaging datasets.",2018,

Leek plants were severely damaged by the leafminer larvae infestation. Typical feeding symptoms were observed, caused by the mining behaviour of larvae within inner and outer leaves of leek plants, resulting in the formation of descending galleries. Pest control was performed locally using commercial insecticides with unknown efficacy mainly due to ignorance of the species biology.",2008,Eppo Bulletin
Sparse Regression Based Structure Learning of Stochastic Reaction Networks from Single Cell Snapshot Time Series,"Stochastic chemical reaction networks constitute a model class to quantitatively describe dynamics and cell-to-cell variability in biological systems. The topology of these networks typically is only partially characterized due to experimental limitations. Current approaches for refining network topology are based on the explicit enumeration of alternative topologies and are therefore restricted to small problem instances with almost complete knowledge. We propose the reactionet lasso, a computational procedure that derives a stepwise sparse regression approach on the basis of the Chemical Master Equation, enabling large-scale structure learning for reaction networks by implicitly accounting for billions of topology variants. We have assessed the structure learning capabilities of the reactionet lasso on synthetic data for the complete TRAIL induced apoptosis signaling cascade comprising 70 reactions. We find that the reactionet lasso is able to efficiently recover the structure of these reaction systems, ab initio, with high sensitivity and specificity. With only < 1% false discoveries, the reactionet lasso is able to recover 45% of all true reactions ab initio among > 6000 possible reactions and over 102000 network topologies. In conjunction with information rich single cell technologies such as single cell RNA sequencing or mass cytometry, the reactionet lasso will enable large-scale structure learning, particularly in areas with partial network structure knowledge, such as cancer biology, and thereby enable the detection of pathological alterations of reaction networks. We provide software to allow for wide applicability of the reactionet lasso.",2016,PLoS Computational Biology
"Late Turonian Microfossils and Paleoclimate in the Songliao Basin, NE China","Although the paleoclimate of the marine Cretaceous has been well studied, the paleoclimate of the non-marine is still not well understood. The Songliao Basin was one of the largest non-marine rift basins during Cretaceous. The Well-preserved Cretaceous lacustrine deposits in this basin provide a unique opportunity to study terrestrial paleoenvironments and paleoclimate during the Late Cretaceous. Here, the microfossils from the Late Turonian Qingshankou Formation of the Songliao Basin were used to investigate the paleoenvironments and paleoclimate of east Asia. There are two spore and pollen assemblages recognized: a Cedripites-Cyathidites-Classopollis assemblage from Upper Member 1, and a Cedripites-Cyathidites-Classopollis assemblage from Lower Member 2 of the Qingshankou Formation, respectively. Besides, relatively abundant ostracods have been identified. In the Songliao Basin, the climate was relatively warm and wet during Late Turonian, with good source rock deposited in the Songliao lake.",2019,Open Journal of geology
Universidade Federal De Pelotas Faculdade De Agronomia Eliseu Maciel Programa De PÃ³s-graduaÃ§Ã£o Em CiÃªncia E Tecnologia De Sementes,"The use of quality seeds and the use of products that enable improvement of their performance in the field, are important elements for a high agricultural production. Biostimulants are plant growth substances that can act alone or in comination to promote plant development. Through these substances it is possible to influence many physiological and/or morphological processes such as germination, vegetative growth, flowering, fruiting, senescence and abscission. This interference can occur by the application of these substances on seeds, soil or leaves. In such a way that needs to be absorbed to performance its role. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ""biostimulant"" use in early treatment of soybean seeds. Seed samples treated 15 and 5 days before the day of sowing and in the day of sowing with the product ""FERTIACTYL LEG were used. These samples were sent to laboratory and were submitted to germination, vigor and root length tests. The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory of the Research Support Foundation of the West of Bahia and the samples were subjected to germination and vigor tests in the Seed Analysis Laboratory Sol (LASSOL), located in Barreiras/BA. The use of ""Fertiactyl leg"" caused no effect on seed germination. The early applications (five and fifteen days before sowing) of Fertiactyl leg in the seeds provided superior performance in accelerated aging, while the application the product on the day of sowing provided a greater root length when compared to non product application. The application of Fertiactyl leg didn't damage seed performance.",2012,
"Zootechnical assessment of straws from different varieties of upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown in Vakinankaratra region, Madagascar","1 UMR SELMET, CIRAD, Bobo-Dioulasso 01, Burkina Faso; 2 UPR AIDA, CIRAD, 110 Antsirabe, Madagascar; 3 UMR SELMET, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France ; 4 UMR SELMET, CIRAD, 110 Antsirabe, Madagascar; paulo.salgado@cirad.fr Introduction In the Vakinankaratra region, upland rice production has increased since new cold-tolerant altitude varieties have been developed and disseminated. Upland rice represented about 20% of the total rice surface in the high altitude areas in 2012. Rice cultivation provides considerable amounts of straw, which represents an important feed resource for ruminants, especially during periods of green forage deficit.In this region, cattle population is estimated at more than 300,000 heads. The nutritive value of straw is relatively low (low protein content and digestibility) and its fill unit value is high. Improving nutritive value of rice straw could improve animal performance and feed autonomy. Physical and chemical treatments as well as feed supplementation improve straw digestibility and its ingestion by animals. Plant breeding and cultivation techniques remain potential ways to improve the nutritive value of straw without affecting grain productivity (Vadiveloo, 1995).The variability of production, of chemical composition and of nutritive value of the straw among rice varieties was investigated through the effect of the soil (Williams et al., 1996), of the season (Vadiveloo and Phang, 1996), the mowing techniques (Dong et al., 2013), and fertilization or irrigation (Agnihotriet al., 2003; Demarquillyet al., 1998; Baumontet al., 2008). The present study focuses on the analysis of the variability of grain and rice straw production of nine upland rice varieties in selection trials, under farm and optimized management conditions. Improving the nutritional quality of rice straw would improve the autonomy of farmers for forage resources, reduce livestock production costs and improve milk production. Materials and methods",2014,
Spectral Deconfounding and Perturbed Sparse Linear Models,"Standard high-dimensional regression methods assume that the underlying coefficient vector is sparse. This might not be true in some cases, in particular in presence of hidden, confounding variables. Such hidden confounding can be represented as a high-dimensional linear model where the sparse coefficient vector is perturbed. We develop and investigate a class of methods for such model. We propose some spectral transformations, which change the singular values of the design matrix, as a preprocessing step for the data which serves as input for the Lasso. We show that, under some assumptions, one can achieve the optimal $\ell_1$-error rate for estimating the underlying sparse coefficient vector. We also illustrate the performance on simulated data and a real-world genomic dataset.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Automatic feed phase identification in multivariate bioprocess profiles by sequential binary classification.,"In this paper, we propose a new strategy for retrospective identification of feed phases from online sensor-data enriched feed profiles of an Escherichia Coli (E.Â coli) fed-batch fermentation process. In contrast to conventional (static), data-driven multi-class machine learning (ML), we exploit process knowledge in order to constrain our classification system yielding more parsimonious models compared to static ML approaches. In particular, we enforce unidirectionality on a set of binary, multivariate classifiers trained to discriminate between adjacent feed phases by linking the classifiers through a one-way switch. The switch is activated when the actual classifier output changes. As a consequence, the next binary classifier in the classifier chain is used for the discrimination between the next feed phase pair etc. We allow activation of the switch only after a predefined number of consecutive predictions of a transition event in order to prevent premature activation of the switch and undertake a sensitivity analysis regarding the optimal choice of the (time) lag parameter. From a complexity/parsimony perspective the benefit of our approach is three-fold: i) The multi-class learning task is broken down into binary subproblems which usually have simpler decision surfaces and tend to be less susceptible to the class-imbalance problem. ii) We exploit the fact that the process follows a rigid feed cycle structure (i.e. batch-feed-batch-feed) which allows us to focus on the subproblems involving phase transitions as they occur during the process while discarding off-transition classifiers and iii) only one binary classifier is active at the time which keeps effective model complexity low. We further use a combination of logistic regression and Lasso (i.e. regularized logistic regression, RLR) as a wrapper to extract the most relevant features for individual subproblems from the whole set of high-dimensional sensor data. We train different soft computing classifiers, including decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM) and an own developed fuzzy classifier and compare our method with conventional multi-class ML. Our results show a remarkable out-performance of the here proposed method over static ML approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness. We achieved close to error free feed phase classification while reducing the misclassification rates in 17 out of 20 investigated test cases in the range between 39% and 98.2% depending on feature set and classifier architecture. Models trained on features based on selection by RLR significantly outperformed those trained on features suggested by experts and their predictive performance was considerably less affected by the choice of the lag parameter.",2017,Analytica chimica acta
Sample size determination for training cancer classifiers from microarray and RNA-seq data,"The objective of many high-dimensional microarray and RNA-seq studies is to develop a classifier of cancer patients based on characteristics of their disease. The germinal center B-cell (GCB) classifier study in lymphoma and the National Cancer Institute's Director's Challenge lung (DC-lung) study are two examples. In recent years, such classifiers are often developed using regularized regression, such as the lasso. A critical question is whether a better classifier can be developed from a larger training set size and, if so, how large the training set should be. This paper examines these two questions using an existing sample size method and a novel sample size method developed here specifically for lasso logistic regression. Both methods are based on pilot data. We reexamine the lymphoma and lung cancer data sets to evaluate the sample sizes, and use resampling to assess the estimation methods. We also study application to an RNA-seq data set. We find that it is feasible to estimate sample size for regularized logistic regression if an adequate pilot data set exists. The GCB and the DC-lung data sets appear adequate, under specific assumptions. Existing human RNA-seq data sets are by and large inadequate, and cannot be used as pilot data. Pilot RNA-seq data can be simulated, and the methods in this paper can be used for sample size estimation. A MATLAB program is made available.",2015,The Annals of Applied Statistics
"Cultivation and characterization of the bacterial assemblage of epsomic Basque Lake, BC","Athalassohaline waters that are rich in divalent ions are good analogues for the chemical environments of Mars and the ocean worlds. Sulfate salts, along with chlorides, are important in Mars regolith with Ca, Fe, Mg, and Na counterions. Certain lakes in the Pacific Northwest are saturated with MgSO4 as epsomite. Here we report on the microbial community of Basque Lake, BC, a group of playas that is saturated with MgSO4. More than 60 bacterial isolates were obtained from Basque Lake soils by enrichment culture and repetitive streak-plating using media containing 10% (~â€‰1.7Â M) NaCl or 50% (~â€‰2Â M) MgSO4. Most of the isolates (~â€‰75%) were Gram-positive, motile, and produced endospores. Isolates related to Marinococcus halophilus and Virgibacillus marismortui dominated the collection. Halomonas and Salinivibrio were Gram-negative genera found at Basque Lake. Nearly all of the Basque Lake isolates grew at 50% MgSO4, with 65% growing at 60% MgSO4. Several isolates could grow in saturated (67%) MgSO4 (awâ€‰=â€‰0.90). All of the isolates grew at 10% NaCl with 70% growing at 20% salinity (~â€‰3.5Â M NaCl; awâ€‰=â€‰0.82). Basque Lake isolates grew better at basic pH than acidic pH, with 80% growing at pH 9 and 30% growing at pH 10. Only 20% of the isolates grew at pH 5. Numerical taxonomy dendrograms based on 44 phenetic characteristics showed a strong correspondence to phylogenetic trees constructed from 16S rRNA gene sequences. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene sequences from direct DNA extracts of Basque Lake soils recovered predominantly Proteobacteria (60%), Firmicutes (11%), and unclassified bacteria (27%).

A Comparative Study of Single-Trait and Multi-Trait Genomic Selection,"In recent years of animal and plant breeding research, genomic selection (GS) became a choice for selection of appropriate candidate for breeding as it significantly contributes to enhance the genetic gain. Various studies related to GS have been carried out in the recent past. These studies were mostly confined to single trait. Although GS methods based on single trait have not performed very well in cases like pleiotropy, missing data and when the trait under study has low heritability. Gradually, some studies were carried out to explore the possibility of methods for GS based on multiple traits in the view of overcoming the above-mentioned problems in the method of single-trait GS (STGS). Currently, multi-trait-based GS methods are getting importance as it exploits the information of correlated structure among response. In this study, we have compared various methods related to STGS, such as stepwise regression, ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Bayesian, best linear unbiased prediction, and support vector machine, and multi-trait-based GS methods, such as multivariate regression with covariance estimation, conditional Gaussian graphical models, mixed model, and LASSO. In almost all cases, multi-trait-based methods are found to be more accurate. Based on the results of this study, it may be concluded that multi-trait-based methods have great potential to increase genetic gain as they utilize the correlation among the response variable as extra information, which contributes to estimate breeding value more precisely. This study is a comprehensive review of the methods of GS right from single trait to multiple traits and comparisons among these two classes.",2019,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology
OEM for least squares problems,"We propose an algorithm, called OEM (a.k.a. orthogonalizing EM), intended for var- ious least squares problems. The first step, named active orthogonization, orthogonalizes an arbi- trary regression matrix by elaborately adding more rows. The second step imputes the responses of the new rows. The third step solves the least squares problem of interest for the complete orthog- onal design. The second and third steps have simple closed forms, and iterate until convergence. The algorithm works for ordinary least squares and regularized least squares with the lasso, SCAD, MCP and other penalties. It has several attractive theoretical properties. For the ordinary least squares with a singular regression matrix, an OEM sequence converges to the Moore-Penrose gen- eralized inverse-based least squares estimator. For the SCAD and MCP, an OEM sequence can achieve the oracle property after sufficient iterations for a fixed or diverging number of variables. For ordinary and regularized least squares with various penalties, an OEM sequence converges to a point having grouping coherence for fully aliased regression matrices. Convergence and convergence rate of the algorithm are examined. These convergence rate results show that for the same data set, OEM converges faster for regularized least squares than ordinary least squares. This provides a new theoretical comparison between these methods. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the proposed algorithm.",2011,arXiv: Computation
Acetabular cup liner and prosthetic head exchange to increase the head diameter for management of recurrent luxation of a prosthetic hip in two dogs.,"Component malalignment and impingement are possible causes of recurrent luxation following total hip replacement in the dog. In the two cases presented in this report, luxation that was probably due to impingement was managed by exchanging the standard 17 mm prosthetic head for a 24 mm prosthetic head. This required removal of the original acetabular cup liner and placement of a new polyethylene liner that would accept the 24 mm head into the stable acetabular shell. In the first case, a 50 kg Malamute dog, recurrent luxation was initially managed by component alignment revision, iliofemoral suture, triple pelvic osteotomy and a novel lasso technique, without long-term success. After exchanging the head and cup liner, luxation did not recur over a 12-month period. In the second case, a 65 kg Newfoundland dog, impingement was suspected after a second luxation event. Luxation did not recur during the nine months after exchange of the head and cup liner. The larger prosthetic head used in these two cases increased the impingement-free range-of-motion of the joint and increased the translation distance required for luxation (jump distance).",2015,Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T
"Adoption in India - the Past, Present and the Future Trends","INTRODUCTIONAdoption of children in India""Adoption is the establishment of a parent-child relationship through a legal and social process other than the birth process. It is a process by which a child of one set of parents becomes the child of another set of parents or parent (Ananthalakshmi, Sampoorna, Mushtaq, Sheelajayanthi, and Charulatha, 2001). Indian adoption policies are sculpted, by several years of ongoing efforts by social reform lobbyists and child welfare organizations. This is evident from the laws and policies set forth by the Government of India. A more recent policy in the Chapter IV of the Juvenile Justice Act of 2000 implemented the concept of secular adoption whereby, without any reference to the community or religious persuasions of the parents or the child concerned, a right appears to be granted to all citizens to adopt, and all children to be adopted. While this was a positive change, this concept still did not give the legal and legitimate status to the child equal to that of a biological, legitimate child. Later, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children Act of 2006) cleared the issue, where the adoption was defined as the process through which the adopted child is permanently separated from the biological parents and becomes the legitimate child of the adoptive parents with all rights, privileges and responsibilities that are attached to the relationship. This act introduced the expression child in need of care and protection. Through this paper, our purpose is to address the past, present, and the future of adoption in India. For that, one should first understand more about the historical perspective of Indian adoption.Historical perspective of Indian adoptionIn India, adoption has been practiced for thousands of years. Hinduism being the major religion practiced in India, epics and history has records of saints and royals who were adopted and who did adopt. Ramayana and Mahabharata are the two such great epics of Hinduism which bear references to adoption. Historically, where a lack of male offspring occurred, couples went in for adopting a male child to designate him as lawful heir. According to Hindu tradition, sons are crucial and a dead parent's soul can only attain heaven if that person has a son to light the funeral pyre, and salvation can be achieved through sons who offer ancestral worship (Vlassof, 1990). To understand more, a brief narration on adoption practices of two old civilizations in the history of human kind is compared in the following section to find out the reasons for adoption.Indian and Roman culture in adoption practiceIn early times, religion and scripture played a significant role in Indian and Roman culture. Thus, the act of adoption was adult centric and patriarchal, the male child of the kin becoming the beneficiary (Nilima Mehta, personal communication, Oct 31, 2009). Most traditional adoptions in India were a private arrangement between the adults involved. They were identified as kinship adoption happening within the extended family (Mahtani, 1994). In the Roman culture, a father adopted a son to perpetuate his name and to have someone to receive his inheritance (Parrish, 1982). Once adopted, the son's relationship to his past life was severed and his debts were canceled. While the objectives of ancient adoption seemed to be focused on performing last rites, kinship, and property interest, India began to consider the Western rationale for adoption from the social perspectives.Social changes in Indian adoptionChildren who became orphans due to abandonment, poverty and wars created a reason for the authorities to look into their wellbeing. Initially such children were automatically included into their families by the next kin, from either side of the family. Andal Damodaran (personal communication, Dec 21, 2009) stated that when there were no relatives to care for these children, giving them up for adoption was considered to be the next best choice. â€¦",2012,Journal of psychosocial research

Adaptive Blade Twist - Calculations and Experimental Results.,"Abstract Applying adaptronics to helicopters has a high potential to significantly suppress noise, reduce vibration, and increase the overall aerodynamic efficiency. This paper presents recent investigations on a very promising specific concept described as Adaptive Blade Twist (ABT). This concept allows us to directly control the twist of the helicopter blades by smart adaptive elements. This influences positively the main rotor area which is the primary source for helicopter noise and vibration. Since the interaction of non-stationary helicopter aerodynamics and elastomechanical structural characteristics of the helicopter blades causes flight envelope limitations, vibration and noise, a good comprehension of the aerodynamics is essential for the development of structural solutions to effectively influence the local airflow conditions and finally develop the structural concept. With respect to these considerations, the ABT concept will be presented. This concept is based on the actively controlled tension-torsion-coupling of the structure. For this, an actuator is integrated within a helicopter blade that is made of an anisotropic material based on fiber composites. Driving the actuator results in a local twist of the blade tip in such a way that the blade can be considered as a torsional actuator. Influencing the blade twist distribution finally results in a higher aerodynamic efficiency. The paper starts at giving a review on conventional concepts and potential adaptive solutions for shape control. After, some calculations of the adaptive twist control concept are presented. These are based on a representative model in which the active part of the rotor blade is simplified with a thin-walled rectangular beam, that is structurally equivalent to a model rotor blade of the Bo105 with a scaling factor 2.54. The calculations are performed using an expanded Wlassow theory. The results are valid for static and dynamic conditions. For the dynamic condition excessive deformations near the blade resonance frequency shall be utilised. Therefore, the actuated blade section has to be properly designed for this precondition. This has been demonstrated and verified in experiments, which will not be discussed in this paper. For experimental investigations on the ABT concept the skin of the outer part of the model rotor blade was manufactured of fibre composite material using the above mentioned tension-torsion-coupling effect with an additional uncoupling layer between skin and spar. The experimental results have shown that near to the resonance frequency dynamic forces of 550Â±550 N are required for a deformation of Â± 3 degrees at the blade tip.",2000,Aerospace Science and Technology
Class-Specific Sparse Multiple Kernel Learning for Spectralâ€“Spatial Hyperspectral Image Classification,"In recent years, many studies on hyperspectral image classification have shown that using multiple features can effectively improve the classification accuracy. As a very powerful means of learning, multiple kernel learning (MKL) can conveniently be embedded in a variety of characteristics. This paper proposes a class-specific sparse MKL (CS-SMKL) framework to improve the capability of hyperspectral image classification. In terms of the features, extended multiattribute profiles are adopted because it can effectively represent the spatial and spectral information of hyperspectral images. CS-SMKL classifies the hyperspectral images, simultaneously learns class-specific significant features, and selects class-specific weights. Using an $L_{1}$-norm constraint (i.e., group lasso) as the regularizer, we can enforce the sparsity at the group/feature level and automatically learn a compact feature set for the classification of any two classes. More precisely, our CS-SMKL determines the associated weights of optimal base kernels for any two classes and results in improved classification performances. The advantage of the proposed method is that only the features useful for the classification of any two classes can be retained, which leads to greatly enhanced discriminability. Experiments are conducted on three hyperspectral data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performances for hyperspectral image classification compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms, and the results confirm the capability of the method in selecting the useful features.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing

"Floating point: a computational study of buoyancy, equilibrium, and gastroliths in plesiosaurs","Three-dimensional mathematical/computational models of three types of plesiosaur (Liopleurodon - short neck, Cryptoclidus - medium neck, and Thalassomedon - long neck) were used to investigate aspects of their flotation and stability. Equivalent models of an extant alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) were used as tests. With full lungs, and uniform tissue densities of 1,050 g/l, all five models would float at the surface, with the alligator and sea turtle models replicating the depths of immersion and inclinations observed in living forms. Impractically large amounts of gastroliths were needed to initiate sinking - even with the lungs 50% inflated,10 kg of stones were still required in a 218 kg Cryptoclidus to produce negative buoyancy, and the hypothesis that gastroliths were for control of buoyancy is rejected. However, gastroliths equal to 1% of body weight in the Thalassomedon model were effective at damping out buoyant oscillations of the neck when at the surface and minimizing instability when fully immersed at 10 meters depth. The oblate bodies of Cryptoclidus and Liopleurodon provided effective passive mechanisms for righting the body if perturbed by waves at the surface, but the almost circular cross-section of the Thalassomedon body was ineffective in self-righting. The relatively longer flippers of Thalassomedon may have provided higher drag to resist rolling. The idea that plesiosaurs could maintain their necks above the water surface in an erect manner is rejected due to unbalanced buoyancy torques acting on the body.",2006,Lethaia
Accounting for spatial dependency in multivariate spectroscopic data,"We examine a hybrid multivariate regression technique to account for the spatial dependency in spectroscopic data due to adjacent measurement locations in the same joint by combining dimension reduction methods and linear mixed effects (LME) modeling. Spatial correlation is a common limitation (assumption of independence) encountered in diagnostic applications involving adjacent measurement locations, such as mapping of tissue properties, and can impede tissue evaluations. Near-infrared spectra were collected from equine joints (n = 5) and corresponding biomechanical (n = 202), compositional (n = 530), and structural (n = 530) properties of cartilage tissue were measured. Subsequently, hybrid regression models for estimating tissue properties from the spectral data were developed in combination with principal component analysis (PCA-LME) scores and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO-LME). Performance comparison of PCA-LME and principal component regression, and LASSO-LME and LASSO regression was conducted to evaluate the effects of spatial dependency. A systematic improvement in calibration modelsâ€™ correlation coefficients and a decrease in cross validation errors were observed when accounting for spatial dependency. Our results indicate that accounting for spatial dependency using a LME-based approach leads to more accurate prediction models.",2018,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems

Complexity Analysis of the Lasso Regularization Path,"The regularization path of the Lasso can be shown to be piecewise linear, making it possible to ""follow"" and explicitly compute the entire path. We analyze in this paper this popular strategy, and prove that its worst case complexity is exponential in the number of variables. We then oppose this pessimistic result to an (optimistic) approximate analysis: We show that an approximate path with at most O(1/sqrt(epsilon)) linear segments can always be obtained, where every point on the path is guaranteed to be optimal up to a relative epsilon-duality gap. We complete our theoretical analysis with a practical algorithm to compute these approximate paths.",2012,ArXiv
Analyzing Facebook Activities for Personality Recognition,"Facebook is the largest and the most popular online social network application that records large amount of usersâ€™ behavior expressed in various activities such as Facebook likes, status updates, posts, comments, photos, tags and shares. One of the major attractions of such a dataset relates to the predictability of the individualsâ€™ psychological traits from their digital footprints. Such predictions help researchers and service providers to improve personalized offering of products and services. The goal of this work is to investigate the predictability of Facebook usersâ€™ personality traits, measured by BIG5 test as a function of their digital records of behavior such as Facebook likes. This research is based on a dataset of 92,255 users who provided their Facebook likes and the results of their BIG5 personality test. As the Facebook likes data includes 600 attributes, the proposed model uses LASSO algorithm to select the best features and to predict Facebook usersâ€™ BIG5 personality traits. The best accuracy level of these predictions is achieved for Openness and Extraversion, the lowest accuracy level is obtained for Agreeableness while the accuracy levels of Conscientiousness and Neuroticism are in the middle.",2017,2017 16th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)
Extension of replica analysis to MAP estimation with applications to compressed sensing,"The replica method is a non-rigorous but widely-accepted technique from statistical physics used in the asymptotic analysis of large, random, nonlinear problems.

La evoluciÃ³n del pensamiento de Meillassoux sobre el parentesco: de la filiaciÃ³n a la salvaguarda,"This article discusses the models of kinship that Meillassoux built in 1975 and 2001. I point at shared theoretical, methodological and political features: an evolutionary guidance, an interest that focuses less on the adequacy of ethnographic models than on their ability to combine with each other and a political interest firstly in the capitalist exploitation of the domestic community and secondly in the evolution from societies of looting to aristocratic societies. But I also lean on what they differ from one another. The geo-historical field, which in 1975 includes hunter-gatherer societies, the ginecoestatic agricultural societies and ginecomobile agricultural societies, while in 2001 it embraces hunter-gatherer societies, adelphic societies (both ginecostatic and ginecomobile) and aristocratic societies. And above all, the understanding of kinship: in 1975 as filiation â€“which led him to argue that the relationships within hordes of hunters and gatherers were those of adhesion, not of kinshipâ€“ and in 2001 as the sustainment of daily life and reproduction, hence aiming at most intimate and lasting relationships.",2015,

Analysis of Controls in ChIP-seq,"The chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) method, initially introduced a decade ago, is widely used by the scientific community to detect protein/DNA binding and histone modifications across the genome in various cell lines. Every experiment is prone to noise and bias, and ChIP-seq experiments are no exception. To alleviate bias, incorporation of control datasets in ChIP-seq analysis is an essential step. The controls are used to detect background signal, whilst the ChIP-seq experiment captures the true binding or histone modification signal. However, a recurrent issue is the existence of noise and bias in the controls themselves, as well as different types of bias in ChIP-seq experiments. Thus, depending on which controls are used, peak calling can produce different results (i.e., binding site positions) for the same ChIP-seq experiment. Consequently, generating ""smart"" controls, which model the non-signal effect for a specific ChIP-seq experiment, could enhance contrast and thus increase the reliability and reproducibility of the results. Our analysis aims to improve our understanding of ChIP-seq controls and their biases. We use unsupervised clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to compare 160 controls for the K562 cell line in the ENCODE project, finding distincting groupings of controls which correlate to experimental characteristics. To customize a control for each ChIP-seq experiment, we use LASSO regression to fit a sparse set of controls to each of 500 ChIP-seq experiments (again, from ENCODE data for the K562 cell line). We look at how many controls are selected, which controls are used per ChIP-seq experiment, and how they are related to the different ChIP-seq experiment characteristics. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that the LASSO models are not particularly sparse, often including half of the possible controls to model any given ChIP-seq. Cross-validation as well as testing with smaller sets of candidate controls proves that such large numbers of controls are beneficial for modeling ChIP-seq background distributions. We also observe clusters of ChIP-seq experiments that tend to rely on clusters of controls, and we look at the experimental characteristics that tend to cause a given control to be useful in modeling the background of a given ChIP-seq experiment. Through these analyses, we attempt to answer largely-unstudied questions regarding how much control data and of what types are useful in ChIP-seq analysis, and how suitable controls can be matched to ChIP-seq datasets.",2017,"Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology,and Health Informatics"

Signal Reconstruction of Pulmonary Vein Recordings Using a Phenomenological Mathematical Model: Application to Pulmonary Vein Isolation Therapy,"Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia, is commonly initiated by ectopic beats originating from a small myocardial sleeve extending over the pulmonary veins. Pulmonary vein isolation therapy attempts to isolate the pulmonary veins from the left atrium by ablating tissue, commonly by using radiofrequency ablation. During this procedure, the cardiologist records electrical activity using a lasso catheter, and the activation pattern recorded is used as a guide toward which regions to ablate. However, poor contact between electrode and tissue can lead to important regions of electrical activity not being recorded in clinic. We reproduce these signals through the use of a phenomenological model of the cardiac action potential on a cylinder, which we fit to post-AF atrial cells, and model the bipolar electrodes of the lasso catheter by an approximation of the surface potential. The resulting activation pattern is validated by direct comparison with those of clinical recordings. A potential application of the model is to reconstruct the missing electrical activity, minimizing the impact of the information loss on the clinical procedure, and we present results to demonstrate this.",2017,Frontiers in Physiology
Abundant assemblage of Ostracoda (Crustacea) in Mexican Miocene amber sheds light on the evolution of the brackish-water tribe Thalassocypridini,"Abstract Amber inclusions of fully aquatic animals are rare, most of them isolated specimens of water-bound insect larvae. In contrast, we here describe an ample, speciose fauna of 262 fully aquatic individuals of Ostracoda (Crustacea) from Mexican amber of Early Miocene age. This fauna was trapped whilst under water swimming around trunks of resin-producing trees in a brackish lagoon. Ostracod crustaceans are typically around a millimeter in length, and are known for their mostly well-calcified bivalved carapaces that account for their unparalleled fossil record in arthropods. However, in the Chiapas amber we found representatives of the tribe Thalassocypridini, which are characterised by lightly calcified carapaces and therefore lack a substantial fossil record. Embedded in amber, this â€˜drawbackâ€™ becomes a clear benefit because the unobstructed view onto the appendages otherwise hidden in the carapace allowed us to identify nine ostracod species, six of them new to science. The exceptional number of individuals permitted insights into population composition, reproduction, taphonomy and into micro-environmental parameters of the amberâ€™s place of formation. Based on ecological data available for Recent Thalassocypridini species, we posit that this tribe reached a peak radiation in open lagoonal settings during the Miocene, and shifted towards anchialine environments by the Recent. http://zoobank.org/lsid:zoobank.org:pub:3C93A06B-F86B-404F-985D-139897F97EF3",2019,Historical Biology
Structure analysis of the extracellular domain reveals disulfide bond forming-protein properties of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv2969c,"Disulfide bond-forming (Dsb) protein is a bacterial periplasmic protein that is essential for the correct folding and disulfide bond formation of secreted or cell wallassociated proteins. DsbA introduces disulfide bonds into folding proteins, and is re-oxidized through interaction with its redox partner DsbB. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a Gram-positive bacterium, expresses a DsbA-like protein ( Rv2969c), an extracellular protein that has its Nterminus anchored in the cell membrane. Since Rv2969c is an essential gene, crucial for disulfide bond formation, research of DsbA may provide a target of a new class of anti-bacterial drugs for treatment of M.tuberculosis infection. In the present work, the crystal structures of the extracellular region of Rv2969c (Mtb DsbA) were determined in both its reduced and oxidized states. The overall structure of Mtb DsbA can be divided into two domains: a classical thioredoxin-like domain with a typical CXXC active site, and an Î±-helical domain. It largely resembles its Escherichia coli homologue EcDsbA, however, it possesses a truncated binding groove; in addition, its active site is surrounded by an acidic, rather than hydrophobic surface. In our oxidoreductase activity assay, Mtb DsbA exhibited a different substrate specificity when compared to EcDsbA. Moreover, structural analysis revealed a second disulfide bond in Mtb DsbA, which is rare in the previously reported DsbA structures, and is assumed to contribute to the overall stability of Mtb DsbA. To investigate the disulphide formation pathway in M.tuberculosis, we modeled Mtb Vitamin K epoxide reductase (Mtb VKOR), a binding partner of Mtb DsbA, to Mtb DsbA.",2013,Protein & Cell
Integrated tumor stromal features of hepatocellular carcinoma reveals two distinct subtypes with prognostic/predictive significance,"Current clinical classification of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unable to predict prognosis efficiently. Our aim is to classify HCC into clinically/biologically relevant subtypes according to stromal factors. We detected seven types of stromal features in tumors from 161 HCC patients by immunohistochemical staining and Hematoxylin-eosin staining. Five stromal features were selected out of seven types of stromal features to construct stromal type based on LASSO COX regression model. Then, integrating multiple clinicopathologic characteristics and stromal type, we built two nomograms for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Further validation of the stromal type and nomograms were performed in the testing cohort (n = 160) and validation cohort (n = 120). Using the LASSO model, we classified HCC patients into stromal type A subgroup (CD34lowTIL-stromal-ratiohighStromal-tumor-ratiolowÎ±-SMAweakStromamature) and stromal type B subgroup (CD34highTIL-stromal-ratiolowStromal-tumor-ratiohighÎ±-SMAstrongStromaimmature). The stromal type was an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS in the training, testing and validation cohorts. Two nomograms (for OS and DFS) that integrated the stromal type and clinicopathologic risk factors also showed good predictive accuracy and discriminatory power. In addition, immune cell recruitment in the tumor microenvironment (TME) was conditioned by the tumor stromal type. In conclusion, the newly developed tumor stromal type was an effective predictor of OS and DFS. Furthermore, the stromal type is associated with the immune phenotype in the TME.",2019,Aging (Albany NY)
Atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia presenting with massive IgM paraprotein,"Dear Editor, An 82-year-old male presented to our hospital with worsening fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and an inability to care for himself. His white blood cell count was 52,300/ Î¼L, hemoglobin 7.0 g/dL, hematocrit 22.4%, and platelet count of 84,000/Î¼L. Peripheral smear demonstrated red blood cell agglutination, platelet clumping, and lymphocytosis with predominantly small atypical lymphocytes and plasmacytoid lymphocytes (Fig. 1a, b). This prompted evaluation of quantitative immunoglobulins, which demonstrated markedly elevated serum IgM at 5379 mg/dL, with mild suppression of IgG (504 mg/dL) and IgA (59 mg/ dL). Serum viscosity was elevated at 3.4 CP. Beta-2 microglobulin was 3.5 mg/L, ESR 81 mm/h, LDH 245 U/L, and albumin 3.8 g/dL. Retinal exam demonstrated tortuous vessels due to long-standing hypertension vs hyperviscosity, with only occasional dot blot hemorrhages. Subsequent bone marrow biopsy demonstrated markedly hypercellular (95%) marrow with extensive involvement by a diffuse infiltration of small lymphocytes admixed with 2â€“5% CD138+ plasma cells (Fig. 1c, d). Immunophenotyping demonstrated that lymphocytes were positive for abnormal expression of CD5 (very low), CD19 (increased), CD23, FMC7, with normal expression of CD20, CD38, and CD45 without CD10. Bone marrow cytogenetics and FISH testing demonstrated complex karyotype including trisomy 12 and t(8;14) without t(11;14). MYD88 mutation testing was negative by next generation sequencing of exons 3, 4, and 5 of the MYD88 gene [1]. Thus, our patientâ€™s diagnosis was best classified as atypical CLL. While the patient initially denied symptoms of hyperviscosity including headache, dizziness, hearing loss, or visual disturbance, he subsequently had several transient episodes of unresponsiveness, inability to articulate verbally, and left sided weakness. CT angiogram of the head and neck and MRI brain showed evidence of chronic microvascular disease, but no acute findings, and his symptoms were felt most likely related to hyperviscosity. Although the pat ient was ini t ia l ly s tar ted on bortezomib/ dexamethasone for presumed Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia prior to the final diagnosis of atypical CLL, the patient subsequently declined further treatment including chemotherapy or plasmapheresis. Due to progressive decline, he was transitioned to hospice care. Monoclonal IgM protein is a cardinal feature of Waldenstromâ€™s macroglobulinemia (WM); however, IgM secretion is also found in a subset of CLL patients. In a single-institution retrospective study, 26 out of 1053 cases of CLL, approximately 2.5%, were associated with serum IgM paraprotein [2]. Quantitative serum levels of IgM in CLL vary per retrospective study, with median values ranging from 90 to 1810 mg/dL [2â€“5]. In comparison, serum IgM levels in WM tend to be higher, with median levels ranging from 2200 to 3215 mg/dL [3, 5]. This case report highlights a rare case of atypical CLL presenting with massive IgM elevation mimicking Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. While there are reports in the literature of CLL leading to hyperviscosity syndrome, these are typically related to sustained hyperleukocytosis > 500,00/ Î¼L and not to elevated serum IgM levels [6]. To our knowledge, this case is the first to report hyperviscosity related to CLLassociated IgM paraproteinemia [4]. * Lisa Tachiki ltachiki@uw.edu",2018,Annals of Hematology
"Palynology of the Toarcian-Aalenian Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) at Fuentelsaz (Lower-Middle Jurassic, Iberian Range, Spain)","article i nfo The Fuentelsaz Section is located in the Castilian Branch of the Iberian Range (Guadalajara, Spain). Its exceptional Lower-Middle Jurassic transition outcrops led to its designation as the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point for the base of the Aalenian. The sediments of the Toarcian-Aalenian transition at Fuentelsaz are composed of marls with interbedded limestones in rhythmic alternation. Marls are dominant in the Toarcian and the Opalinum Zone up to the middle part of the Comptum Subzone. In the remaining Comptum Subzone, marly materials are scarce and limestones predominate. Sedimentation at Fuentelsaz took place over an extensive marine epeiric carbonate platform that was well connected with the open sea. In the Fuentelsaz Section, a total of 43 palynomorph taxa were recorded: 23 spore taxa, 13 pollen taxa, 4 acritarchs, 2 prasinophytes and 1 dinoflagellate cyst. The studied sediment samples were always dominated by terrestrial allochthonous miospores. In general, miospore assemblages are biased due to the transport of pollen from land or islands to the continental platform. Spheripollenites, Classopollis or indeed both pollens numerically dominate the assemblages. Other miospores appear in low numbers. Aquatic palynomorphs are also scarce; Micrhystridium lymensis is the most common. Five palynological assemblages (PA) were distinguished: PA1, PA2 and PA3 are Toarcian in age, PA4 is located at the boundary between the Toarcian and the Aalenian and PA5. This latter palynological assemblage which is lower Aalenian in age shows a strong reduction in palynomorph diversity and preservation in the Comptum Subzone. Palaeoecological analysis of the palynomorphs indicated the presence of calm, oligotrophic sea water. The palaeofloral communities of gymnosperms and vascular cryptogamsâ€”which grew in subtropical arid conditionsâ€”were poorly diversified.",2010,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
An optimal learning method for developing personalized treatment regimes,"A treatment regime is a function that maps individual patient information to a recommended treatment, hence explicitly incorporating the heterogeneity in need for treatment across individuals. Patient responses are dichotomous and can be predicted through an unknown relationship that depends on the patient information and the selected treatment. The goal is to find the treatments that lead to the best patient responses on average. Each experiment is expensive, forcing us to learn the most from each experiment. We adopt a Bayesian approach both to incorporate possible prior information and to update our treatment regime continuously as information accrues, with the potential to allow smaller yet more informative trials and for patients to receive better treatment. By formulating the problem as contextual bandits, we introduce a knowledge gradient policy to guide the treatment assignment by maximizing the expected value of information, for which an approximation method is used to overcome computational challenges. We provide a detailed study on how to make sequential medical decisions under uncertainty to reduce health care costs on a real world knee replacement dataset. We use clustering and LASSO to deal with the intrinsic sparsity in health datasets. We show experimentally that even though the problem is sparse, through careful selection of physicians (versus picking them at random), we can significantly improve the success rates.",2016,ArXiv
An Efficient Algorithm For Weak Hierarchical Lasso,"Linear regression is a widely used tool in data mining and machine learning. In many applications, fitting a regression model with only linear effects may not be sufficient for predictive or explanatory purposes. One strategy that has recently received increasing attention in statistics is to include feature interactions to capture the nonlinearity in the regression model. Such model has been applied successfully in many biomedical applications. One major challenge in the use of such model is that the data dimensionality is significantly higher than the original data, resulting in the small sample size large dimension problem. Recently, weak hierarchical Lasso, a sparse interaction regression model, is proposed that produces a sparse and hierarchical structured estimator by exploiting the Lasso penalty and a set of hierarchical constraints. However, the hierarchical constraints make it a non-convex problem and the existing method finds the solution to its convex relaxation, which needs additional conditions to guarantee the hierarchical structure. In this article, we propose to directly solve the non-convex weak hierarchical Lasso by making use of the General Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (GIST) optimization framework, which has been shown to be efficient for solving non-convex sparse formulations. The key step in GIST is to compute a sequence of proximal operators. One of our key technical contributions is to show that the proximal operator associated with the non-convex weak hierarchical Lasso admits a closed-form solution. However, a naive approach for solving each subproblem of the proximal operator leads to a quadratic time complexity, which is not desirable for large-size problems. We have conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. Results show that our proposed algorithm is much more efficient and effective than its convex relaxation. To this end, we further develop an efficient algorithm for computing the subproblems with a linearithmic time complexity. In addition, we extend the technique to perform the optimization-based hierarchical testing of pairwise interactions for binary classification problems, which is essentially the proximal operator associated with weak hierarchical Lasso. Simulation studies show that the non-convex hierarchical testing framework outperforms the convex relaxation when a hierarchical structure exists between main effects and interactions.",2016,ACM Trans.

On the distribution of the adaptive LASSO estimator,"We study the distribution of the adaptive LASSO estimator (Zou (2006)) in finite samples as well as in the large-sample limit. The large-sample distributions are derived both for the case where the adaptive LASSO estimator is tuned to perform conservative model selection as well as for the case where tuning results in consistent model selection. We show that the finite-sample as well as the large-sample distributions are typically highly non-normal, regardless of the choice of the tuning parameter. The uniform convergence rate is also obtained, and is shown to be slower than n^{-1/2} in case the estimator is tuned to perform consistent model selection. In particular, these results question the statistical relevance of the `oracle' property of the adaptive LASSO estimator established in Zou 2006). Moreover, we also provide an impossibility result regarding the estimation of the distribution function of the adaptive LASSO estimator.",2007,

Cross validation in LASSO and its acceleration,"We investigate leave-one-out cross validation (CV) as a determinator of the weight of the penalty term in the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). First, on the basis of the message passing algorithm and a perturbative discussion assuming that the number of observations is sufficiently large, we provide simple formulas for approximately assessing two types of CV errors, which enable us to significantly reduce the necessary cost of computation. These formulas also provide a simple connection of the CV errors to the residual sums of squares between the reconstructed and the given measurements. Second, on the basis of this finding, we analytically evaluate the CV errors when the design matrix is given as a simple random matrix in the large size limit by using the replica method. Finally, these results are compared with those of numerical simulations on finite-size systems and are confirmed to be correct. We also apply the simple formulas of the first type of CV error to an actual dataset of the supernovae.",2016,ArXiv
Effects of New Type Nipple Waterers on Broiler Performance1,"Abstract Four types of waterers were used in a study of broiler performance: 1) Ziggity 1400 E-Z Sip nipple; 2) Plasson bell broiler hanging plastic waterer; 3) Chore-time cup; and 4) Aqua high pressure nipple. In Experiment 1 at 5 wk, the broilers on the Plasson waterer were heavier than the broilers on the Chore-time cup or the Ziggity and Aqua nipples, and broilers on the Ziggity nipples were the lightest. Broilers on the Chore-time cup had better feed conversion than broilers on the other three waterer types. At 7 wk the broilers on the Ziggity nipple were lower in body weight than broilers on the Plasson bell waterer or the Chore-time cup. Broilers on the Chore-time cup had a better feed conversion than the broilers on the Ziggity nipple. In Experiment 2 at 5 wk, the broilers reared on the Ziggity nipple again were lower in body weight than those broilers on Plasson bell waterers or Aqua nipples and at 7 wk were lower in body weight than broilers on the other three waterer types. Broilers were lower In feed conversion on the Plasson bell waterer than broilers on the other three water types. When both experiments were combined at 5 wk, the broilers on the Ziggity nipple were lower in body weight than broilers on the other three waterer types.

Diurnal-Nocturnal Activity of Some Inshore Fishes in the Gulf of California,"the southern Gulf of California. Certain patterns of behavior within and between species were consistently observed, and permit a number of tentative generalizations regarding feeding habits, schooling, and other activity in relation to time of day. Species with predominently diurnal foraging habits include: Mycteroperca rosacea (Streets), Epinephelus labriformis (Jenyns), Chromis atrilobata (Gill), Eupomacentrus rectifraenum (Gill), Abudefduf troschelii (Gill), Bodianus diplotaenia (Gill), Thalassoma lucasanum (Gill), Scarus californiensis (Pellegrin), Heniochus nigrirostris (Gill), Prionurus punctatus Gill, Runula azalea Jordan and Bollman, Balistes verres Gilbert and Starks, and Balistes polylepis Steindachner. Species obtaining most of their food at night include: Holocentrus suborbitalis (Gill), Myripristis occidentalis Gill, Rypticus bicolor (Valenciennes), Lutjanus argentiventris (Peters), Apogon retrosella (Gill), Microlepidotus inornatus Gill, Anisotremus interruptus Gill, Haemulon sexfasciatum Gill, Selar crumenophthalmus (Bloch), and Pareques viola (Gilbert). A number of other species are introduced as their activity relates to the discussion. The nocturnal species are predators, while the herbivorous and omnivorous fishes show predominantly diurnal feeding habits. Those species schooling in dense, relatively inactive schools inshore during the day are nocturnal feeders and the school functions in defense against diurnal predators. Members of these schools disperse to feed at night, often after moving a considerable distance offshore.",1965,Copeia

Structure and evolution of the mitochondrial control region of the pollen beetle Meligethes thalassophilus (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae).,"The organization of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (CR) of the pollen beetle Meligethes thalassophilus is described. This mtDNA CR represents the longest sequenced for beetles so far, since the entire nucleotide sequence ranges from approximately 5000 to approximately 5500 bp. The CR of M. thalassophilus is organized in three distinct domains: a conserved domain near the tRNAIle gene, a variable domain flanking the 12S rRNA gene, and a relatively large central tandem array made up of a variable number of approximately 170 bp repeats that is responsible for the intraspecific length variation observed. Like other CRs found in insects, the M. thalassophilus CR contains two long homopolymeric runs that may be involved in mtDNA replication. Furthermore, conserved stem-and-loop structures in the repetitive domain were identified and their possible role in generating length variation is examined. Intraspecific comparison of the tandem repeat elements of M. thalassophilus suggests mechanisms of concerted evolution leading to homogenization of the repetitive region. The utility of such an array of tandem repeats as a genetic marker for assessing population-level variability and evolutionary relationships among populations is discussed. Finally, the technical difficulties found in isolating the mtDNA CR in beetles are remarked upon.",2008,Genome
Compressive Sensing Based Estimation of Direction of Arrival in Antenna Arrays,"This thesis is concerned with the development of new compressive sensing (CS) techniques both in element space and beamspace for estimating the direction of arrival of various types of sources, including moving sources as well as fluctuating sources, using one-dimensional antenna arrays. The problem of estimating the angle of arrival of a plane electromagnetic wave is referred to as the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation problem. Such algorithms for estimating DOA in antenna arrays are often used in wireless communication network to increase their capacity and 
throughput. DOA techniques can be used to design and adapt the directivity of the array antennas. For example, an antenna array can be designed to detect a number of incoming signals and accept signals from certain directions only, while rejecting signals that are declared as interference. This spatio-temporal estimation and filtering 
capability can be exploited for multiplexing co-channel users and rejecting harmful co-channel interference that may occur because of jamming or multipath effects. 
In this study, three CS-based DOA estimation methods are proposed, one in the element space (ES), and the other two in the beamspace (BS). The proposed techniques do not require a priori knowledge of the number of sources to be estimated. Further, all these techniques are capable of handling both non-fluctuating and fluctuating source signals as well as moving signals. The virtual array concept is utilized in order to be able to identify more number of sources than the number of the sensors used. 
In element space, an extended version of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, the adaptable LASSO (A-LASSO), is presented. A-LASSO is utilized to solve the DOA problem in compressive sensing framework. It is shown through extensive simulations that the proposed algorithm outperforms the classical DOA estimation techniques as well as LASSO using a small number of snapshots. Furthermore, it is able to estimate coherent as well as spatially-close sources. This technique is then extended to the case of DOA estimation of the sources in unknown noise fields. 
In beamspace, two compressive sensing techniques are proposed for DOA estimation, one in full beamspace and the other in multiple beam beamspace. Both these techniques are able to estimate correlated source signals as well as spatially-close sources using a small number of snapshots. Furthermore, it is shown that the computational 
complexity of the two beamspace-based techniques is much less than that of the element-space based technique. It is shown through simulations that the performance of the DOA estimation techniques in multiple beam beamspace is superior to that of the other two techniques proposed in this thesis, in addition to having the lowest computational complexity. 
Finally, the feasibility for real-time implementation of the proposed CS-based DOA estimation techniques, both in the element-space and the beamspace, is examined. It is shown that the execution time of the proposed algorithms on Raspberry Pi board are compatible for real-time implementation.",2017,
Appendix : The Effects of Political Institutions on the Extensive and Intensive Margins of Trade In,"We present a model of political networks that integrates both the choice of trade partners (the extensive margin) and trade volumes (the intensive margin). Our model predicts that regimes secure in their survival, including democracies as well as some consolidated authoritarian regimes, will trade more on the extensive margin than vulnerable autocracies, which will block trade in products that would expand interpersonal contact among their citizens. We then apply a two-stage Bayesian LASSO estimator to detailed measures of institutional features and highly disaggregated product-level trade data encompassing 131 countries over a half century. Consistent with our model, we find that (a) political institutions matter for the extensive margin of trade but not for the intensive margin and (b) the effects of political institutions on the extensive margin of trade vary across products, falling most heavily on goods whose marketing involves extensive interpersonal contact.",2017,

In addition, the unbiased estimator is shown to be asymptotically consistent. With these results on hand, various model selection criteriaâ€”Cp, AIC and BICâ€”are available, which, along with the LARS algorithm, provide a principled and efficient approach to obtaining the optimal lasso fit with the computational effort of a single ordinary least-squares fit.",2004,Annals of Statistics

The analysis of data of a retrospective and transversal survey in 2008 done in 903 breedings in the towns of Bobo-Dioulasso, Dori, Gaoua and Kaya has allowed to indentify 3 types. A type A (1.77% of the total breedings), known as intensive is Characterized by an high investment, a pig flock of 107 heads, 01 paid employee, an average sale of 70 pigs/ year. The pigs which were in Permanent Close (PC) were very well fed and treated. The type B, known as semiintensive was noticed in all the towns. The investment, the flock (14 heads) and the paid employees (0.37 as the average) were less important than in the type A. The pigs were in Permanent Close (in rainy season) and in Partial Close (in dry season). This type has sold fewer pigs than the type A. The type C known as extensive, observed in all the towns was the most frequent with an investment and a paid employee extremely low (0.01) of breeding without accommodations. The partial close even the ramblings were the way of keeping. This type has sold more pigs but got less takings than B. The feeding constraint was the most crucial in all the types of breeding. The reusing of the production waste and its transformation could be an alternative to cope with this constraint.",2014,
An â„“1-oracle inequality for the Lasso in finite mixture Gaussian regression models,"We consider a finite mixture of Gaussian regression models for high-dimensional heterogeneous data where the number of covariates may be much larger than the sample size. We propose to estimate the unknown conditional mixture density by an l 1 -penalized maximum likelihood estimator. We shall provide an l 1 -oracle inequality satisfied by this Lasso estimator with the Kullbackâ€“Leibler loss. In particular, we give a condition on the regularization parameter of the Lasso to obtain such an oracle inequality. Our aim is twofold: to extend the l 1 -oracle inequality established by Massart and Meynet [12] in the homogeneous Gaussian linear regression case, and to present a complementary result to Stadler et al. [18], by studying the Lasso for its l 1 -regularization properties rather than considering it as a variable selection procedure. Our oracle inequality shall be deduced from a finite mixture Gaussian regression model selection theorem for l 1 -penalized maximum likelihood conditional density estimation, which is inspired from Vapnikâ€™s method of structural risk minimization [23] and from the theory on model selection for maximum likelihood estimators developed by Massart in [11].",2013,Esaim: Probability and Statistics
"Mothers who sell sex: a potential paradigm for integrated HIV, sexual, and reproductive health interventions among women at high risk of HIV in Burkina Faso.","BACKGROUND
Antenatal care is a point of entry into the health system for women across Africa and may facilitate the uptake of HIV services among female sex workers (FSWs). This study aimed to evaluate the determinants of motherhood among FSWs, their sexual risks, and their engagement in health care.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to July 2013 among FSWs in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. The study used respondent-driven sampling for HIV testing and behavioral data collection. Predictors of motherhood and the association of motherhood and sex work dynamics were assessed separately using logistic regression.


RESULTS
Of the 696 women enrolled, the majority of participants (76.6%, n = 533) had at least 1 biological child. Mothers were more likely to have a nonpaying partner [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20 to 2.49], and significantly less likely to currently desire to conceive (aOR, 0.21; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.33). Motherhood was predictive of having reduced condomless vaginal or anal sex with a new client [age-adjusted odds ratio (aaOR), 0.80; 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.97] in the past 30 days, and increased condomless vaginal or anal sex with a nonpaying partner (aaOR, 1.49; 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.96). Motherhood was prognostic of a higher likelihood of ever being tested for HIV (aaOR, 1.89; 95% CI: 1.55 to 2.31). Motherhood was predictive of reporting limited difficulty when accessing health services (aaOR, 0.15; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.34).


CONCLUSIONS
Motherhood is common among FSWs. The results indicate that FSWs who are mothers may have more exposure to health care because of seeking antenatal/perinatal services, presenting important opportunities for inclusion in the HIV continuum of care and to prevent vertical transmission.",2015,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes
Case report: CADASIL,"Background and aim: Notch signaling pathway is important for the regulation of cell fate decisions and cellular differentiation in many organs. NOTCH3 belongs to a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors. In response to interaction with ligands, it undergoes a set of proteolytic events releasing a signaling molecule to the nucleus where it interacts with the DNA-binding protein RBP-Jk. Point mutations in NOTCH3 lead to a disorder called CADASIL, resulting in adult onset of migraine, recurrent strokes and vascular dementia in humans. Our objective is to create transgenic cell lines that stably express CADASILassociated mutations to induce higher production of NOTCH3 proteins. Methods: CADASIL mutations, R142C and C456R, were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis into mouse NOTCH3 (mN3). Different mN3 constructs were transfected into C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line to induce high NOTCH3 expression. The entire gene was sequenced and immonublotting was carried out to verify expression of the protein. Real-time RT-PCR was conducted to determine level of expression before clones were selected. Results:We have established transgenic lines of C2C12 cells expressingmN3 with CADASILmutations, R142C andC456R.R142C is amutation locatedonexon 4 of mN3 gene corresponding to CADASIL mutation R141C in human NOTCH3 (hN3), whereas C456R is a mutation on exon 8 corresponding to CADASIL mutation C455R in hN3. We have chosen several lines that showed higher expression compared to the endogenous expression of mN3 in C2C12. Conclusion: Thus far, studies showing that NOTCH signaling pathway is impaired in cells carrying a typical CADASIL mutation have been inconclusive. Wepostulate thatCADASILmutationshave adirect consequenceon theNOTCH3 protein foldingmachinery as a result of the loss or gain of cysteine residues. Our present plan is to harvest NOTCH3 proteins from the transgenic cell lines for protein chemistry analyses and protein expression studies.",2009,Journal of the Neurological Sciences
Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and dimensionality reduction techniques in quantitative structure retention relationship modeling of retention in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography.,"The objective of this study was to model the retention of nucleosides and pterins in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) via QSRR-based approach. Two home-made (Amino-P-C18, Amino-P-C10) and one commercial (IAM.PC.DD2) HILIC stationary phases were considered. Logarithm of retention factor at 5% of acetonitrile (logkACN) along with descriptors obtained for 16 nucleosides and 11 pterins were used to develop QSRR models. We used and compared the predictive performance of three regression techniques: partial least square (PLS), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and the LASSO followed by stepwise multiple linear regression. The highest predictive squared correlation coefficient (QLOOCV(2)) in PLS analysis was found for Amino-P-C10 (QLOOCV(2)=0.687) and IAM.PC.DD2 (QLOOCV(2)=0.506) and the lowest for IAM.PC.DD2 (QLOOCV(2)=-0.01). Much higher values were obtained for the LASSO model. The QLOOCV(2) equaled 0.9 for Amino-P-C10, 0.66 for IAM.PC.DD2 and 0.59 for Amino-P-C18. The combination of LASSO with stepwise regression provided models with comparable predictive performance as the LASSO, however with possibility of calculating the standard error of estimates. The use of LASSO itself and in combination with classical stepwise regression may offer greater stability of the developed models thanks to more smooth change of coefficients and reduced susceptibility towards chance correlation. Application of QSRR-based approach, along with the computational methods proposed in this work, may offer a useful approach in the modeling of retention of nucleoside and pterin compounds in HILIC.",2015,Journal of chromatography.

A Unifying Probabilistic Perspective for Spectral Dimensionality Reduction: Insights and New Models,"We introduce a new perspective on spectral dimensionality reduction which views these methods as Gaussian Markov random fields (GRFs). Our unifying perspective is based on the maximum entropy principle which is in turn inspired by maximum variance unfolding. The resulting model, which we call maximum entropy unfolding (MEU) is a nonlinear generalization of principal component analysis. We relate the model to Laplacian eigenmaps and isomap. We show that parameter fitting in the locally linear embedding (LLE) is approximate maximum likelihood MEU. We introduce a variant of LLE that performs maximum likelihood exactly: Acyclic LLE (ALLE). We show that MEU and ALLE are competitive with the leading spectral approaches on a robot navigation visualization and a human motion capture data set. Finally the maximum likelihood perspective allows us to introduce a new approach to dimensionality reduction based on L1 regularization of the Gaussian random field via the graphical lasso.",2012,J.

Adaptive Non-Parametric Regression With the $K$-NN Fused Lasso,"The fused lasso, also known as total-variation denoising, is a locally-adaptive function estimator over a regular grid of design points. In this paper, we extend the fused lasso to settings in which the points do not occur on a regular grid, leading to an approach for non-parametric regression. This approach, which we call the $K$-nearest neighbors ($K$-NN) fused lasso, involves (i) computing the $K$-NN graph of the design points; and (ii) performing the fused lasso over this $K$-NN graph. We show that this procedure has a number of theoretical advantages over competing approaches: specifically, it inherits local adaptivity from its connection to the fused lasso, and it inherits manifold adaptivity from its connection to the $K$-NN approach. We show that excellent results are obtained in a simulation study and on an application to flu data. For completeness, we also study an estimator that makes use of an $\epsilon$-graph rather than a $K$-NN graph, and contrast this with the $K$-NN fused lasso.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
"Prophylactic antioxidants and phenolics of seagrass and seaweed species: A seasonal variation study in a Southern Indian Ocean Island, Mauritius","The seasonal variations in the polyphenolic contents and potential antioxidant activities of seven seaweed species ( Padina gymnospora, Gracilaria salicornia, Palisada papillosa, Galaxaura rugosa, Enteromorpha intestinalis, Codium arabicum and Dictyosphaeria cavernosa ) and five seagrass species ( Syringodium isoetifolium, Halodule uninervis, Thalassodendron ciliatum, Halophila ovalis and Halophila stipulacea ) were assessed. In summer, the highest total phenolic content was recorded in the seaweed P. gymnospora and the lowest in G. rugosa . The total phenolic contents in the seagrass species were significantly higher than those observed in the seaweed species during both seasons. The highest flavonoid concentrations (FC) were observed in the seaweed species E. intestinalis in winter and in the seaweed P. gymnospora in summer. All tested species had higher FC in winter. The highest antioxidant activity (assessed using the Ferric ion reducing antioxidant power) was in the seaweed P. gymnospora during summer (FRAP: 9.7 Â± 0.3 X10Â¯Â³ FeÂ²+mM/g DW). However, the seaweed P. gymnospora extract and the extracts from all 5 seagrass species had significantly different (p<0.01) antioxidant activities (assessed using the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay) in winter compared to the summer season. The collective data are indicative of the potential of Mauritian seaweeds and seagrasses as possible sources of secondary metabolites for pharmaceuticals. Further analysis using bio-efficacy models are warranted to justify the phytoceutical capacity of the seaweeds and seagrasses.

Slave Systems in Africa,"The slave trade has been a major theme of historical writing on Africa for many years, but it is only recently that scholars have begun to look seriously at slavery within African societies themselves. With the recent publication of three books the trickle of studies on this subject has now become a flood. The first of these, L'esclavage en Afrique precoloniale, edited by Claude Meillassoux, contains seventeen studies of slavery, mostly from francophone West Africa. Slavery in Africa, edited by Suzanne Miers and Igor Kopytoff, includes sixteen studies, eleven of which focus on west Africa. Frederick Cooper's book, Plantation Slavery on the East Coast of Africa, presents a regionally comparative study of east African plantations. Each of these volumes opens with a general introduction to the subject of African slavery, and these will form the primary focus of this essay. A salient impression that emerges from reading the three books is that African slave systems showed enormous diversity; plantation slaves in Zanzibar had little in common with the elite military tyeddo in Senegambia, or for that matter with Sena slaves in Mozambique, who were integrated into the acquiring lineages. Often, a single society would embrace several co-existing slave systems, and the picture is further complicated by the fact that slave systems changed over time. Miers and Kopytoff underline this diversity by suggesting no fewer than seventeen different (though sometimes overlapping) terms to describe different types of slavery (p. 77). In the face of such diversity, generalization becomes very hazardous. One such hazard was illustrated by George Murdock when he abstracted certain features from a variety of African kingdoms and concluded that there was a unique type of ""African kingship."" On closer study, however, it became apparent that some of the features of these kingdoms were simply derived from the fundamental logic of governing which applied to kingdoms all over the world, some derived from similar ecological constraints, and some features which looked alike on the surface turned out to be very different when each was examined in its own context.",1978,History in Africa
Statistical Downscaling with Bayesian Quantile Regression to Estimate Extreme Rainfall in West Java,"West Java is one of the largest regions producing rice in Indonesia. Information on rainfall is very important for farmers to anticipate extreme events that can cause losses in agriculture. Extreme rainfall patterns can be modeled by Bayesian quantile regression. Parameters of the model are estimated by MCMC. This study used statistical downscaling to obtain relationship between global scale data and local scale data. The data were monthly rainfall data in West Java based on three type of land, low, medium, high land, and GCM output data. LASSO regularization was used to overcome multicollinearity problem in GCM output data. The purpose of this study was to model Bayesian quantile regression in each type of land. The Bayesian quantile regression model in the lowlands can predict extreme rainfall accurately and consistently in one year ahead.",2019,International Journal of Sciences: Basic and Applied Research
Application of Penalized Mixed Model in Identification of Most Associated Factors with Hemoglobin A1c Level in Type 2 Diabetes,"BACKGROUND : The effect of controlling blood sugar on decreasing diabetes complications and their fatality has been investigated in many cross-sectional studies, but instability of blood sugar and some of the potential effective factors on it during the time render these studies imprecise and unreliable. Exploring among a big number of possible covariates is another challenging issue which renders the traditional methods inefficient. Therefore, we aimed to determine factors which are mostly associated with HbA1c level, among a large number of potential covariates using penalized linear mixed model in a longitudinal study METHOD: The participants consisted of diabetic patients referred to Endocrine and Metabolism Research Center of Isfahan from 2000 to 2012 who were measured 4-12 times. Linear mixed model with LASSO penalty was used to investigate the relationship between HbA1c and the factors which potentially affect HbA1c. SPSS version 18 and glmmLasso package in R. 3.1.3 software were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS : Most of the 360 patients, (62.5%) were female. Their mean age was 52.2 years (SD=9.24) and median number of their visit was 5 with inter-quartile range of 4 to 6. The simple mixed model revealed that all of the covariates had significant effects on HbA1c, but using LMMLASSO led to elimination of 8 redundant covariates from the final model. CONCLUSION : By Appling linear mixed model with LASSO penalty retinopathy, hypertension, cholesterol, HDL and TG had the most significant association with HbA1c level.",2016,Global Journal of Health Science
A Network Compatibility Condition For Compressed Sensing Over Complex Networks,"This paper continues our recently initiated line of work on analyzing the network Lasso (nLasso, which has been proposed as an efficient learning algorithm for massive networkstructured data sets (big data over networks).

Terrestrial outgoing infrared radiation as an indicator of seismic activity,"The analysis of satellite thermal images of the Earth's surface within the spectral range of 10.5-11.3 mkm has shown that over some linear structures of the Middle-Asian seismically active region there is observed a stable in time and space increasing intensity of the outgoing radiation flux as compared to contiguous blocks. A retrospective analysis of a continuous series of observations of the outgoing IR radiation flux has shown that in certain individual zones of some major tectonic dislocations there appear from time to time positive anomalies of IR radiation, for instance at the point of intersection of the Talasso-Ferghana and Tamdy-Tokrauss faults. These anomalies last from 2 to 10 days. The spontaneous anomalies are characterized by a pulsating variation of area. The space confinement and duration of these anomalies permit distinguishing theme noise anomalies caused by meteorological factors. The time of the appearance of these anomalies coincides with the activation of faults over which there has been detected an increase of the outgoing IR radiation flux. In 1984 the majority of crustal earthquakes, of a magnitude over 4, in the Tien Shan were accompanied by the appearance of a positive anomaly of the IR radiation at the point of the intersection of the faults. The area of anomalies was n*10000 km2. The most outstanding example of such activization is the Ghazli earthquake of 19.03.1984 M7.2. At the point of the intersection of the Tamdy-Tokrauss and Talasso- Ferghana faults there was detected on March 11 a positive anomaly of the outgoing IR radiation flux of exceptional intensity and enormous area (about 100 thousand km2). The subsequent earthquakes in the zone of the Tamdy-Tokrauss fault in the summer of 1984 of the magnitudes from 4.3 to 5.3 were also preceded by the appearance of a positive anomaly of the outgoing IR radiation at the point of intersection of the faults.",2020,arXiv: Geophysics
Identification of Prognostic and Metastatic Alternative Splicing Signatures in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma,"Background: Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is the malignancy originated from the renal epithelium, with a high rate of distant metastasis. Aberrant alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNA are widely reported to be involved in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of multiple cancers. The aim of this study is to explore the mechanism of alternative splicing events (ASEs) underlying tumorigenesis and metastasis of KIRC. Methods: RNA-seq of 537 KIRC samples downloaded from the TCGA database and ASEs data from the TCGASpliceSeq database were used to identify ASEs in patients with KIRC. The univariate and Lasso regression analysis were used to screen the most significant overall survival-related ASEs (OS-SEs). Based on those, the OS-SEs model was proposed. The interaction network of OS-SEs and splicing factors (SFs) with absolute value of correlation coefficient value >0.750 was constructed by Pearson correlation analysis. The OS-SEs significantly related to distant metastasis and clinical stage were identified by non-parametric test, and those were also integrated into co-expression analysis with prognosis-related Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways identified by Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA). ASEs with significance were selected for multiple online database validation. Results: A total of prognostic 6,081 overall survival-related ASEs (OS-SEs) were identified by univariate Cox regression analysis and a prediction model was constructed based on 5 OS-SEs screened by Lasso regression with the Area Under Curve of 0.788. Its risk score was also illustrated to be an independent predictor, which the good reliability of the model. Among 390 identified candidate SFs, DExD-Box Helicase 39B (DDX39B) was significantly correlated with OS and metastasis. After external database validation, Retained Intron of Ras Homolog Family Member T2 (RHOT2) and T-Cell Immune Regulator 1 (TCIRG1) were identified. In the co-expression analysis, overlapped co-expression signal pathways for RHOT2 and TCIRG1 were sphingolipid metabolism and N-glycan biosynthesis. Conclusions: Based on the results of comprehensive bioinformatic analysis, we proposed that aberrant DDX39B regulated RHOT2-32938-RI and TCIRG1-17288-RI might be associated with the tumorigenesis, metastasis, and poor prognosis of KIRC via sphingolipid metabolism or N-glycan biosynthesis pathway.",2019,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology
"Discussion:""A significance test for the lasso""","It is rare in our field that we can speak of a true discovery, but this is one such occasion. It is an unexpected result that the steps by which variables enter a lasso path permit a basic statistical test with a simple null distribution that is asymptotically valid and has good finite-sample properties. This test may become standard, and maybe it should simply be called â€œthe lasso testâ€ because it is difficult to conceive of a form of inference more intimately tied to the lasso.1 The authors use forward stepwise variable selection as their straw man, and this for good reason because the t-tests on which stepwise selection builds are essentially a heuristic abuse of the testing framework that entirely ignores the effects of selection. The lasso tests, by contrast, account for selection and shrinkage that is implicit in the lasso. Insight into how this is possible is one of the many byproducts of this innovative and thought provoking article. One of the beauties of the authorsâ€™ article is Lemma 3 where it is shown that the transformation of sorted test statistics |z(j)| using the formula |z(j)|(|z(j)| âˆ’ |z(j+1)|) generates quantities that have limiting null distributions Exp(1/j) as pâ†’âˆž. By comparison, |z(j)| keeps growing under the null at the rate âˆš 2 log p. It is a quite remarkable fact that for this particular series of transformed statistics a limiting distribution can be obtained under competition by an unlimited number of null predictors, that is, pâ†’âˆž.",2014,
Italy: Fiscal Consolidation and its Legacy,"Balassone, Franco, Momigliano and Monacelli examine the process of fiscal consolidation in Italy during the Nineties. They highlight its success in reversing a trend that could have led to public debt default, and in ensuring the early participation of Italy to monetary union. The authors argue that some features of the process may have amplified its costs and may have left the country with a difficult legacy. The adjustment relied on significant tax increases, capital spending reductions and the rationing of transfers to local governments. Balassone et al. examine the reforms introduced in the pension system in order to contain expenditure growth, reducing distortions in the labour market and increasing the role of funding. They acknowledge that much has been achieved but point to some aspects that still remain problematic. They also analyse the changes introduced in the tax system and highlight the persistent contrast between the need to maximise revenue and that of minimising distortions. According to the authors, there is now a need to shift the focus of fiscal policy from the arithmetic to the microeconomics of fiscal sustainability. Sustaining high taxes and low investment may become difficult as the integration of the Single European Market goes further. Allowing for a lower tax burden, while complying with EMU fiscal rules, calls for expenditure control, a task made more difficult by the upward pressure on outlays exerted by the ageing process. Balassone et al. note that the current trend towards greater autonomy for local governments may require significant institutional engineering to ensure consistency with EMU fiscal rules. More generally, existing budgetary procedures and institutions will have to be reconsidered. Finally, with EMU macroeconomic stabilisation regains importance, while during the Nineties it was not the main focus of fiscal policy. Budgetary targets should allow sufficient room for manoeuvre. Size and quality of automatic stabilisers will have to be reconsidered.",2002,
Detecting the Dimensionality for Principal Components Model,A crucial issue for principal components analysis (PCA) is to determine the number of principal components to capture the variability of usually high-dimensional data. In this article the dimension detection for PCA is formulated as a variable selection problem for regressions. The adaptive LASSO is used for the variable selection in this application. Simulations demonstrate that this approach is more accurate than existing methods in some cases and competitive in some others. The performance of this model is also illustrated using a real example.,2010,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation

A flexible adaptive lasso Cox frailty model based on the full likelihood,"In this work a method to regularize Cox frailty models is proposed that accommodates time-varying covariates and time-varying coefficients and is based on the full instead of the partial likelihood. A particular advantage in this framework is that the baseline hazard can be explicitly modeled in a smooth, semi-parametric way, e.g. via P-splines. Regularization for variable selection is performed via a lasso penalty and via group lasso for categorical variables while a second penalty regularizes wiggliness of smooth estimates of time-varying coefficients and the baseline hazard. Additionally, adaptive weights are included to stabilize the estimation. The method is implemented in R as coxlasso and will be compared to other packages for regularized Cox regression. Existing packages, however, do not allow for the combination of different effects that are accommodated in coxlasso.",2020,arXiv: Methodology
Sparse Support Vector Machines with L_{p} Penalty for Biomarker Identification,"The development of high-throughput technology has generated a massive amount of high-dimensional data, and many of them are of discrete type. Robust and efficient learning algorithms such as LASSO [1] are required for feature selection and overfitting control. However, most feature selection algorithms are only applicable to the continuous data type. In this paper, we propose a novel method for sparse support vector machines (SVMs) with L_{p} (p < 1) regularization. Efficient algorithms (LpSVM) are developed for learning the classifier that is applicable to high-dimensional data sets with both discrete and continuous data types. The regularization parameters are estimated through maximizing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the cross-validation data. Experimental results on protein sequence and SNP data attest to the accuracy, sparsity, and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Biomarkers identified with our methods are compared with those from other methods in the literature.

The Spike-and-Slab LASSO,"AbstractDespite the wide adoption of spike-and-slab methodology for Bayesian variable selection, its potential for penalized likelihood estimation has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we bridge this gap by cross-fertilizing these two paradigms with the Spike-and-Slab LASSO procedure for variable selection and parameter estimation in linear regression. We introduce a new class of self-adaptive penalty functions that arise from a fully Bayes spike-and-slab formulation, ultimately moving beyond the separable penalty framework. A virtue of these non-separable penalties is their ability to borrow strength across coordinates, adapt to ensemble sparsity information and exert multiplicity adjustment. The Spike-and-Slab LASSO procedure harvests efficient coordinate-wise implementations with a path-following scheme for dynamic posterior exploration. We show on simulated data that the fully Bayes penalty mimics oracle performance, providing a viable alternative to cross-validation.

Orthogonal Machine Learning for Demand Estimation: High Dimensional Causal Inference in Dynamic Panels,"There has been growing interest in how economists can import machine learning tools designed for prediction to accelerate and automate the model selection process, while still retaining desirable inference properties for causal parameters. Focusing on partially linear models, we extend the Double ML framework to allow for (1) a number of treatments that may grow with the sample size and (2) the analysis of panel data under sequentially exogenous errors. Our low-dimensional treatment (LD) regime directly extends the work in [Chernozhukov et al., 2016], by showing that the coefficients from a second stage, ordinary least squares estimator attain root-n convergence and desired coverage even if the dimensionality of treatment is allowed to grow. In a high-dimensional sparse (HDS) regime, we show that second stage LASSO and debiased LASSO have asymptotic properties equivalent to oracle estimators with no upstream error. We argue that these advances make Double ML methods a desirable alternative for practitioners estimating short-term demand elasticities in non-contractual settings.",2017,arXiv: Machine Learning
2017 International Cancer Education Conference Late-Breaking Abstracts,"Background/Purpose: While studies indicate significant differences regarding medical mistrust among Black and White breast cancer patients, little has been done to determine perceptions and determinants of mistrust amongst Black breast cancer patients. We examined sociodemographic factors that attribute to medical mistrust among Black women, while exploring the relationship betweenmedical mistrust, patient satisfaction, and provider communication. Learning Objectives: The participant shall be able to 1) Discuss issues of mistrust that exist within the Black cancer community; 2) Identify factors that contribute and are related to medical mistrust among Black breast cancer survivors. Methods: A convenience sample of 359 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer and who identified as Black or White were eligible for and completed the parent study. Each participant completed one telephone survey consisting of questions pertaining to sociodemographics, and attitudes, feelings, and beliefs about medical care and breast cancer treatments. Categorical variables were calculated according to ChiSquare, while the F-test was employed for continuous variables. Multiple linear regression (Lasso Method) determined predictors of medical mistrust. Results/Findings: The sample for this investigation consisted of n=210 Black women (58.4%). The linear regression model indicated that women with greater medical mistrust reported less general satisfaction with their medical care (p=0.004). Also, those who obtained a Bachelorâ€™s degree or higher had less medical mistrust (p=0.05). Additionally, women with public insurance demonstrated greater mistrust (p=0.01). While not a contributor to the model, employment status was associated with medical mistrust (p =0.01). Analysis did not indicate a relationship between communication and group-based medical mistrust. Discussion: Findings from this study may inform future endeavors to educate providers on ways to effectively interact with and treat Black breast cancer patients. Findings may also aid in the development of interventions that address and tackle issues of mistrust as reported by Black patients. Further examination is warranted to determine the role, significance, and relationship between socioeconomic factors and group-based medical mistrust. References: Molina, Y. (2015).

Pathway Lasso: Estimate and Select Sparse Mediation Pathways with High Dimensional Mediators,"In many scientific studies, it becomes increasingly important to delineate the causal pathways through a large number of mediators, such as genetic and brain mediators. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a popular technique to estimate the pathway effects, commonly expressed as products of coefficients. However, it becomes unstable to fit such models with high dimensional mediators, especially for a general setting where all the mediators are causally dependent but the exact causal relationships between them are unknown. This paper proposes a sparse mediation model using a regularized SEM approach, where sparsity here means that a small number of mediators have nonzero mediation effects between a treatment and an outcome. To address the model selection challenge, we innovate by introducing a new penalty called Pathway Lasso. This penalty function is a convex relaxation of the non-convex product function, and it enables a computationally tractable optimization criterion to estimate and select many pathway effects simultaneously. We develop a fast ADMM-type algorithm to compute the model parameters, and we show that the iterative updates can be expressed in closed form. On both simulated data and a real fMRI dataset, the proposed approach yields higher pathway selection accuracy and lower estimation bias than other competing methods.",2016,arXiv: Machine Learning
Two-step approach for assessing the health effects of environmental chemical mixtures: application to simulated datasets and real data from the Navajo Birth Cohort Study,"BackgroundThere is increasing interest in examining the consequences of simultaneous exposures to chemical mixtures. However, a consensus or recommendations on how to appropriately select the statistical approach analyzing the health effects of mixture exposures which best aligns with study goals has not been well established. We recognize the limitations that existing methods have in effectively reducing data dimension and detecting interaction effects when analyzing chemical mixture exposures collected in high dimensional datasets with varying degrees of variable intercorrelations. In this research, we aim to examine the performance of a two-step statistical approach in addressing the analytical challenges of chemical mixture exposures using two simulated data sets, and an existing data set from the Navajo Birth Cohort Study as a representative case study.MethodsWe propose to use a two-step approach: a robust variable selection step using the random forest approach followed by adaptive lasso methods that incorporate both dimensionality reduction and quantification of the degree of association between the chemical exposures and the outcome of interest, including interaction terms. We compared the proposed method with other approaches including (1) single step adaptive lasso; and (2) two-step Classification and regression trees (CART) followed by adaptive lasso method.ResultsUtilizing simulated data sets and applying the method to a real-life dataset from the Navajo Birth Cohort Study, we have demonstrated good performance of the proposed two-step approach. Results from the simulation datasets indicated the effectiveness of variable dimension reduction and reliable identification of a parsimonious model compared to other methods: single-step adaptive lasso or two-step CART followed by adaptive lasso method.ConclusionsOur proposed two-step approach provides a robust way of analyzing the effects of high-throughput chemical mixture exposures on health outcomes by combining the strengths of variable selection and adaptive shrinkage strategies.",2019,Environmental Health
Abstract 683: A machine learning based clinical decision support system (CDSS) for anti-PD-1 therapy using non-invasive blood marker and clinical information for lung cancer patients,"Cancer immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 therapy (Î±PD-1) has greatly improved the survival outcome of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the response rates of Î±PD-1 are around 20-30% based on clinical trials. The presence of PD-L1, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte or tumor mutation burden may be used as indicators of response, but are still limited to predict Î±PD-1 response. In this study, we established the machine learning based clinical decision support system (CDSS) to predict the Î±PD-1 response by comprehensively combining clinical information and blood-based data which are easily assessable in routine practice.We enrolled 126 patients with NSCLC treated with the Î±PD-1 at Yonsei cancer center. Clinical data including patient characteristics, mutation, treatment outcomes, and adverse events were collected and analyzed. Forty patients additionally had blood-based immune data by flow cytometry. There were two data sets; clinical data set (n=126) with 15 variables, and immune data set (n=40) with 37 variables. We found that 27 variables out of 52 variables are selected by recursive feature elimination. The responders are defined as PR or SD â‰¥6 months and the non-responders are defined as the others. Supervised learning algorithms such as the LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net, SVM, ANN, and RF were applied to each data set for predicting the Î±PD-1 response. The performances of each model were evaluated according to the ROC curve or cross-validation errors. Variable importance was measured by using the random forest and gradient boosting.Patient characteristics included male (69.8%), age â‰¥ 60 years (66.2%), ECOG 0/1 (77.7%), adenocarcinoma (69.8%), EGFR mutations (15.1%), and PD-L1 positive (61.2%). We classified the patients into responders (38%) and non-responders (62%) in total 126 patients. A result from the clinical data set of 126 patients demonstrated that the Ridge regression model (AUC: 0.78) can more accurately predict the Î±PD-1 response than others. Of 15 clinical variables, some are considered to be important in the following order; tumor burden,age, PD-L1, ECOG PS, and irAE based on the random forest. When we performed the machine learning process with clinical and immune data, The Ridge regression model (AUC:0.82) showed the good performance to predict Î±PD-1 response, compared to the single clinical model. The machine learning based CDSS for aPD-1 to NSCLC patients has benefit for predicting aPD-1 responses. Our prediction model could be easily accessible and fast processed in routine practice. The supervised machine learning based non-invasive predictive score (NIPS) demonstrates the rate of aPD-1 response on NSCLC patients. We will validate NIPS in independent patient cohort and currently are establishing the NIPS as web-based software.

Inferring labrid functional roles through morphological and ecological traits,"The functional approach, using morphology and/or ecological traits, allows grouping of species that play similar roles in an ecosystem. Although species may have unique functions, some may overlap in key morphological traits, leading to similar functions (i.e. functional redundancy). To understand the functional roles of southwestern Atlantic labrids, we analyzed 21 species, focusing on morphological characteristics linked to habitat use, feeding habits and swimming ability, and further taking ontogeny into account by analyzing 3 size categories (small, medium and large) that vary in life history aspects. A comprehensive functional analysis using 11 functional traits defined according to 12 morphological measurements was performed to generate a consensus tree that segregated species into 9 functional groups. Body elongation was the most important characteristic separating parrotfishes from wrasses. Small size class was separated from medium and large size class wrasses and parrotfishes through eye size and eye positioning, respectively. Thalassoma noronhanum was grouped with invertivorous species, despite its classification as a planktivore in previous studies. This species, together with Xyrichtys splendens and Scarus zelindae, showed no size-related shifts in functional role with increasing size. Although recognized as members of different trophic guilds, different size classes of different labrid species may play similar functional roles. This suggests the need for taking size and species identity into account when measuring functional diversity and redundancy in reef ecosystems, key features for maintaining the health and robustness (i.e. resistance/resilience) of reef systems.",2017,Marine Ecology Progress Series
"Convex vs nonconvex approaches for sparse estimation: Lasso, Multiple Kernel Learning and Hyperparameter Lasso","We consider the problem of sparse estimation in a Bayesian framework. We outline the derivation of the Lasso in terms of marginalization of a particular Bayesian model. A different marginalization of the same model leads to a different nonconvex estimator where hyperparameters are optimized. The arguments are extended to problems where groups of variables have to be estimated. An approach alternative to Group Lasso is derived, also providing its connection with Multiple Kernel Learning. Our estimator is nonconvex but one of its versions requires optimization with respect to only one scalar variable. Theoretical arguments and numerical experiments show that the new technique obtains sparse solutions more accurate than the other two convex estimators.",2011,IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference
Computational Intelligence Techniques for OES Data Analysis,"Semiconductor manufacturers are forced by market demand to continually 
deliver lower cost and faster devices. This results in complex industrial processes 
that, with continuous evolution, aim to improve quality and reduce 
costs. Plasma etching processes have been identified as a critical part of the 
production of semiconductor devices. It is therefore important to have good 
control over plasma etching but this is a challenging task due to the complex 
physics involved. 
Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) measurements can be collected 
non-intrusively during wafer processing and are being used more and more 
in semiconductor manufacturing as they provide real time plasma chemical 
information. However, the use of OES measurements is challenging due to 
its complexity, high dimension and the presence of many redundant variables. 
The development of advanced analysis algorithms for virtual metrology, 
anomaly detection and variables selection is fundamental in order to 
effectively use OES measurements in a production process. 
This thesis focuses on computational intelligence techniques for OES data 
analysis in semiconductor manufacturing presenting both theoretical results 
and industrial application studies. To begin with, a spectrum alignment 
algorithm is developed to align OES measurements from different sensors. 
Then supervised variables selection algorithms are developed. These are defined 
as improved versions of the LASSO estimator with the view to selecting 
a more stable set of variables and better prediction performance in virtual 
metrology applications. After this, the focus of the thesis moves to the unsupervised 
variables selection problem. The Forward Selection Component 
Analysis (FSCA) algorithm is improved with the introduction of computationally 
efficient implementations and different refinement procedures. Nonlinear 
extensions of FSCA are also proposed. Finally, the fundamental topic 
of anomaly detection is investigated and an unsupervised variables selection 
algorithm tailored to anomaly detection is developed. In addition, it is shown 
how OES data can be effectively used for semi-supervised anomaly detection 
in a semiconductor manufacturing process. 
The developed algorithms open up opportunities for the effective use of 
OES data for advanced process control. All the developed methodologies 
require minimal user intervention and provide easy to interpret models. This 
makes them practical for engineers to use during production for process monitoring 
and for in-line detection and diagnosis of process issues, thereby resulting 
in an overall improvement in production performance.",2017,
ROS Regression: Integrating Regularization and Optimal Scaling Regression,"In this paper we combine two important extensions of ordinary least squares regression: regularization and optimal scaling. Optimal scaling (sometimes also called optimal scoring) has originally been developed for categorical data, and the process finds quantifications for the categories that are optimal for the regression model in the sense that they maximize the multiple correlation. Although the optimal scaling method was developed initially for variables with a limited number of categories, optimal transformations of continuous variables are a special case. We will consider a variety of transformation types; typically we use step functions for categorical variables, and smooth (spline) functions for continuous variables. Both types of functions can be restricted to be monotonic, preserving the ordinal information in the data. In addition to optimal scaling, three regularization methods will be considered: Ridge regression, the Lasso, and the Elastic Net. The resulting method will be called ROS Regression (Regularized Optimal Scaling Regression. We will show that the basic OS algorithm provides straightforward and efficient estimation of the regularized regression coefficients, automatically gives the Group Lasso and Blockwise Sparse Regression, and extends them with monotonicity properties. We will show that Optimal Scaling linearizes nonlinear relationships between predictors and outcome, and improves upon the condition of the predictor correlation matrix, increasing (on average) the conditional independence of the predictors. Alternative options for regularization of either regression coefficients or category quantifications are mentioned. Extended examples are provided.

CT Features of Lung Cancer Associated with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,"Purpose : It is well known that the incidence of lung cancer is high in patients with idiopathic pulmonaryfibrosis(IPF). We analyzed the CT features of lung cancer associated with IPF. Materials and Methods :Retrospective analysis was performed in 23 patients with lung cancer(24 lung cancers) associated with IPF. Thediagnosis of IPF was made by clinical and CT findings, and lung cancer was confirmed pathologically. We dividedthe location of lung cancer by lobar distribution and central or peripheral lung zone, and measured the size ofmass. We classified the mediastinal lymph node enlargement by American Thoracic Society(ATS) mapping scheme. Weevaluated the CT pattern of IPF. Results : The subjects consisted of 6 cases of small cell carcinoma and 18 casesof non-small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer included 8 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, 4 cases ofadenocarcinoma, 2 cases of large cell carcinoma, 3 cases of poorly differenciated carcinoma, and 1 case ofunclassified malignant neoplosm. The lung cancers were located in the right upper lobe in 5 cases, left upper lobein 6 cases, right middle lobe in 1 case, right lower lobe in 9 cases, and left lower lobe in 3 cases. Twentycancers(85%) were located in the peripheral lung zone. Eighteen cancers(73%) were surrounded by fibrotic lung. Thesize of the mass ranged from 1 to 12cm, and in 12 cases it was below 3cm in diameter. Mediastinal lymph nodes wereenlarged in 22 cases(92%) and classified as N2 or N3 in 15 cases out of 18 non-small cell lung cancers. CTpatterns of underlying IPF were honey-combing in 18 patients(78%) and mixed honey-combing and ground- glassopacity in 5 patients(22%). Conclusion : The lung cancer associated with IPF shows variable cell types.

FIRST: Combining forward iterative selection and shrinkage in high dimensional sparse linear regression,"We propose a new class of variable selection techniques for regression in high dimensional linear models based on a forward selection version of the LASSO, adaptive LASSO or elastic net, respectively to be called as forward iterative regression and shrinkage technique (FIRST), adaptive FIRST and elastic FIRST. These methods seem to work effectively for extremely sparse high dimensional linear models. We exploit the fact that the LASSO, adaptive LASSO and elastic net have closed form solutions when the predictor is onedimensional. The explicit formula is then repeatedly used in an iterative fashion to build the model until convergence occurs. By carefully considering the relationship between estimators at successive stages, we develop fast algorithms to compute our estimators. The performance of our new estimators are compared with commonly used estimators in terms of predictive accuracy and errors in variable selection.

Time Hopping Technique for Reinforcement Learning and its Application to Robot Control,"To speed up the convergence of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms by more efficient use of computer simulations, three algorithmic techniques are proposed: Time Manipulation, Time Hopping, and Eligibility Propagation. They are evaluated on various robot control tasks. The proposed Time Manipulation [1] is a concept of manipulating the time inside a simulation and using it as a tool to speed up the learning process. It is applicable to a subset of RL problems whose goal is to learn a control policy to avoid failure events. Time Manipulation works by turning back the time of the simulation on failure events, thus avoiding redundant state transitions and exploring deeper the state space. This is impossible to be done in the real world, but it can easily be done in a simulation. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, experiments on a classical control benchmark problem are conducted: an inverted pendulum balancing robot task. The aim of the RL algorithm is to find a control policy which can prevent the pendulum from falling by moving the robot left or right, without hitting the edges of the given track. The experimental results show that Time Manipulation speeds up the learning process by 260%. It also improves the state space exploration by 12%, because it allows the RL algorithm to explore better the state space in proximity of failure states. The proposed Time Hopping [2] is a generalization of Time Manipulation, able to make arbitrary â€hopsâ€ between states and this way traverse rapidly throughout the entire state space. Time Hopping extends the applicability of time manipulations to include not only failure-avoidance problems, but also continuous optimization problems, by creating new mechanisms to trigger the time manipulation events, to make prediction about the possible future rewards, and to select promising time hopping targets. The proposed implementation of the Time Hopping technique consists of 3 components: Hopping trigger (decides when the hopping starts), Target selection (decides where does it hop to), and Hopping (performs the actual hopping). For the implementation of the Hopping trigger component, a Gamma pruning technique is proposed, which detects and prunes unpromising exploratory paths. For the Target selection component, a Best Lasso Target Selection technique is proposed, which selects a target among the proximity of the current best policy. The evaluation of Time Hopping is performed on a biped crawling robot task. The crawling robot has 2 limbs, each with 2 segments, for a total of 4 degrees of freedom (DOF), 80 possible actions at each time step, and 13689 possible robot states. The goal of the learning process is to find a crawling motion with the maximum speed. The reward function for this task is defined as the horizontal displacement of the robot after every action. The experimental results show that Time Hopping accelerates the learning process more than 7 times. A very strong point of Time Hopping is that it is completely transparent for the RL algorithm, which offers various opportunities for combining Time Hopping with other approaches for speeding up the learning process. In addition, it can also be used as a tool for re-shaping the state probability distribution as desired [3]. This is achieved by changing the target selection strategy appropriately. The proposed Eligibility Propagation [4] is a mechanism to further speed up Time Hopping. It provides similar abilities to what eligibility traces provide for conventional RL. Eligibility traces are one of the basic mechanisms for temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. An eligibility trace is a temporary record of the occurrence of an event, such as the visiting of a state or the taking of an action. Eligibility Propagation uses the transitions graph to obtain all predecessor states of an updated state. Regardless of the actual order in which Time Hopping visits the states, this oriented graph contains a record of the correct chronological sequence of state transitions. Once this oriented graph is available, it is used to propagate state value updates in the opposite direction of the state transition edges, thus making the propagation flow logically backwards in time. The evaluation of Eligibility Propagation is performed on the same biped crawling robot task as for Time Hopping. The results show that Time Hopping with Eligibility Propagation achieves 99% of the maximum possible speed almost 3 times faster than Time Hopping alone, and more than 4 times faster than conventional Q-learning. This significant speedup of the learning process is achieved despite the additional computational overhead of maintaining the transitions graph. The reason for this is the improved Gamma-pruning based on more precise future reward predictions. All experiments are conducted on a custom developed Javabased software application system, and a custom developed 2D robot physics simulation engine. The significant speed-ups achieved by the proposed algorithms make them very suitable for a wide range of robot control problems, where reducing the computational cost is important [5].",2009,
Karyoevolution of the toadfish Thalassophryne nattereri (Batrachoidiformes: Batrachoididae).,"The Batrachoididae includes some venomous brackish and marine fish found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. This family is composed of 69 species, distributed among 19 genera. Species of the genus Thalassophryne have been reported along the coast of Rio Grande do Norte (Brazil); T. nattereri has been responsible for a large number of human injuries. Little is known about the cytogenetic features of this family. We made a karyotypic characterization of T. nattereri collected from the estuary of the Apodi/MossorÃ³ River, using conventional Giemsa staining, C-banding and silver nitrate-nucleolar organizer region technique. There was a modal diploid value of 2n = 46 chromosomes (8m + 8sm + 24st + 6a; fundamental number = 86). Single ribosomal sites were detected in the terminal region on short arms of a subtelocentric pair (19th). Heterochromatin segments were preferentially located over centromeric regions in some chromosome pairs. Pericentric inversions and Robertsonian rearrangements seem to have played a major role in karyotype evolution within this genus of toadfish.",2009,Genetics and molecular research : GMR
Group Guided Sparse Group Lasso Multi-task Learning for Cognitive Performance Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, causes progressive impairment of cognitive functions of patients. There is thus an urgent need to (1) accurately predict the cognitive performance of the disease, and (2) identify potential MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)-related biomarkers most predictive of the estimation of cognitive outcomes. The main objective of this work is to build a multi-task learning based on MRI in the presence of structure in the features. In this paper, we simultaneously exploit the interrelated structures within the MRI features and among the tasks and present a novel Group guided Sparse group lasso (GSGL) regularized multi-task learning approach, to effectively incorporate both the relatedness among multiple cognitive score prediction tasks and useful inherent group structure in features. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based optimization is developed to efficiently solve the non-smooth formulation. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method using the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets and show that our proposed methods achieve not only clearly improved prediction performance for cognitive measurements, but also finds a compact set of highly suggestive biomarkers relevant to AD.",2017,
Some Partial Unit Memory Convolutional Codes,"K. Abdel-GhaffarUniversity of California, DavisR. J. McEliece 1G.

This classof codes, though not entirely new, has until now remained relatively unexplored.This article shows that it is possible to use the well-developed theory of block codesto construct a large family of promising PUM codes. Indeed, at the end of thearticle the performances of several specific PUM codes are compared with that ofthe Voyager standard (2, i, 6) convolutional code. It was found that these codes canoutperform the Voyager code with little or no increase in decoder complexity. Thissuggests that there may very well be PUM codes that can be used for deep-spacetelemetry that offer both increased performance and decreased implementationalcomplexity over current coding systems.",1991,Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory

Estimation of Influence Distance of Bus Stops Using Bus GPS Data and Bus Stop Properties,"In congested cities where commuting time doubles during peak hours, it is crucial to identify every network problem. Here, it is aimed to analyze the traffic behavior of the buses around the bus stops and to show the effects of the surrounding network to speedup the pattern of buses using the trajectory data of Global Positioning System (GPS)-equipped bus fleet. As an indicator of speed differences near bus stops, influence distance is suggested, wherein the speed of buses significantly changes while approaching and leaving the bus stops. Speed patterns of buses operating on 12 bus routes in Istanbul are analyzed. The data include more than 5000 daily trajectory log files and 25 million rows of location and time information during April 2016. The influence distance, measured using the fused lasso method, for the 438 bus stops varies from 36 to 174m, with an average value of 98m. In the second part of this paper, correlation of the influence distances of the bus stops with the surrounding interruptions is investigated. A distance matrix of surrounding interruptions to the nearest bus stop is generated. This matrix is used as parameters of M5 Prime, random forest, and extremely randomized trees models in order to predict the influence distances. The models show that the passenger demand plays a key role in the influence distances of the bus stops. It is also found that the changes in the number of lanes and the location of the traffic lights are quite effective on the influence distances.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems
"Isolation and Phenotypic Characterization of Moderate Halophilic Bacteria from Athalosaline Lake, Dumat Al-jandal, in Extreme North of Al Jouf (ksa)","Introduction: Hypersaline intra-continental (athalassohaline) salt lakes represent an extreme type of habitat where halophilic prokaryotes are a dominant form of life. Bacteria are commonly found in natural environments containing significant concentration of NaCl. Dumat Al Jandal artificial Lake is a man-made water body located in Dumat Al Jandal, Al-Jouf province. This lake features numerous ecosystems including hypersaline environments in which microbial diversity has never yet been studied. Objective: We evaluate the presence of moderately halophilic microbial population in the lake extreme environments based on Physiochemical and Microbiological characterization. Methodology: Water samples were collected from the lake from different sites. Sample salinity was determined using a conductivity meter. Samples were diluted and cultured on a chemically defined medium (CDM) to grow halophilic bacteria. The density of halophiles was estimated by viable plate counts. A collection of isolates was selected, gram-stained, tested for catalase, and characterized using standard microbiological methods.",2014,"European Scientific Journal, ESJ"

A Survey for Grapevine Viruses in Washington State â€˜Concordâ€™ (Vitis Ã— labruscana L.) Vineyards,"Within the United States, Washington is the number one producer of â€˜Concordâ€™ grapes and the number two producer of wine grapes. Previous studies in wine grapes revealed the presence of twelve different viruses in Washington vineyards. Despite what is known about viruses in wine grapes in Washington, virtually no studies have focused on viruses in Concord vineyards. To further understand the epidemiology of viruses in Washington State, a survey of Concord grapes was conducted in 2010 and 2011. Five hundred Concord vines were sampled and tested for the presence of virus, and five different viruses were found among 92 virus-positive samples. The most common virus found was Grapevine leafrollassociated virus 3 (51 samples), followed by Grapevine fanleaf virus (24 samples), Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 4 (nine samples), Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 2 (four samples), and Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 9 (four samples). The presence of viruses in Concord vineyards is of great concern for growers due to likely movement of virus diseases from Concord grapes to wine grapes that might result in economic losses to the grape industry. Introduction Within the United States, Washington is the number one producer of juice grapes (Vitis Ã— labruscana L. â€˜Concordâ€™ and Vitis labrusca â€˜Niagaraâ€™) and the number two producer of wine grapes (15). The grape and wine industry have an economic impact of about $8.6 billion at the state level and about $14.9 billion at the national level (23). With a role this large in the local and national economy, the grape industry has a very low tolerance for threats to its sustainability, particularly arthropod pests and pathogens. There are many different viruses and other graft-transmissible agents reported from all of the major grape-growing regions in the world. To date, twelve different viruses have been detected in Washington vineyards (Table 1) (15). Of these, Grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaVs) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 have been documented in grapevines (Vitis vinifera) affected with grapevine leafroll disease (GLRD). This disease is considered the most devastating viral disease of V. vinifera cultivars (16) and is present in all major grape-growing regions in the world (10,12). GLRD accounts for 50-60% of global yield losses due to all grapevine viruses and is responsible for about 5-10% of the yield loss in Washington State (16). Of the six GLRaVs known from Washington, Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) was found to be the predominant virus in Washington vineyards (11,16). Grapevine fanleaf disease caused by Grapevine fanleaf virus is another very serious viral disease of grapevines. It is cosmopolitan in distribution and can cause up to 80% yield loss in wine grapes, depending on the cultivar (4). Although much information is available on viruses in V. vinifera cultivars, comparatively little is known about viruses in grape cultivars native to North America, principally Concord and Niagara (11,12). Recently, GLRaV-3 was documented in Concord and Niagara 5 August 2013 Plant Health Progress grapes in Washington State (22). In contrast to wine grape cultivars, Concord and Niagara cultivars appear to have latent infections of GLRD. With latent infections of GLRD in these cultivars, the prevalence of the disease and its economic impact have received little attention. Table 1. Grapevine viruses reported from Washington State vineyards. * Represents direct submissions to GenBank. Other important aspects of grapevine virus epidemiology that have been largely ignored in Concord and Niagara vineyards are vector biology and control. The grape mealybug (Pseudococcus maritimus Ehrhorn) and the European fruit lecanium scale (Parthenolecanium corni BouchÃ©) are known vectors of GLRaV-3 and GLRaV-1 in wine grapes (7,9), but their role in transmitting viruses in juice grape vineyards is unknown. Both vector species are present in Washington vineyards (8). A common occurrence in Washington State is the close proximity of Concord vineyards to wine grape vineyards, and sometimes, the two types of grapes are grown adjacent to each other. Because of the presence of GLRaV-3 in Concord vineyards, the close proximity of Concord vineyards to wine grape vineyards, and the presence of two known vector species in both types of vineyards, it is possible that Concord vineyards could be serving as reservoirs for infection of wine grape vineyards with GLRaV-3 or other viruses, depending on the presence of the appropriate vectors. The primary objective of this study was to survey Concord vineyards in Washington State to document the presence of grapevine viruses. By knowing exactly what viruses are present in Concord grapes, a better assessment can be made of the epidemiology of grapevine viruses in Washington State vineyards and the risk they pose to grape production. Collection of Plant Samples A total of 500 samples were collected between 2010 and 2011 from twelve different Concord vineyard blocks near Prosser, WA. In each vineyard block, 42 Concord vines were sampled randomly. Five leaves, proximal to main trunk and cordon, were detached at the base of the petiole, placed in sealed plastic bags and transported to the Washington State University-Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center, Prosser, for analysis. Detection of Viruses Extraction of samples was accomplished using the protocol by Rowhani et al. (2000) (20) by grinding 25 g of petiole tissue in 5 ml of general extraction buffer (GEB; 1.59 g/liter Na CO , 2.93 g/liter NaHCO , 2% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.2% Virus Year Accession No. Reference GLRaV-1 2005 Not available Martin et al. 2005 (11) GLRaV-2 2005 Not available Martin et al. 2005 (11) GLRaV-3 2005 DQ780885 Martin et al. 2005, Soule et al. 2006 (11,22) GLRaV-4 2006 Not available Naidu et al. 2011 (15) GLRaV-5 2006 Not available Naidu et al. 2011 (15) GLRaV-9 2008 EF101737 Jarugula et al. 2008* GRSPaV 2005 FJ943414 Martin et al. 2005, Alabi et al. 2010* (11,) GV-A 2010 Not available Naidu et al. 2011 (15) GV-B 2010 Not available Naidu et al. 2011 (15) GFLV 2008 EU573307 Mekuria et al. 2008* (11) GSyV-1 2010 GU372349 Mekuria and Naidu 2010* (11) GFkV 2010 AJ309022 Naidu and Mekuria 2010* (11)",2013,Plant Health Progress
Soil moisture forecasting for irrigation recommendation,"Abstract This study integrates measured soil moisture sensor data, a remotely sensed crop vegetation index, and weather data to train models, in order to predict future soil moisture. The study was carried out on a cotton farm, with wireless soil moisture monitoring equipment deployed across five plots. Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine modeling methods were trialled. Random Forest models gave consistently good results (mean 7-day prediction error from 8.0 to 16.9 kPA except in one plot with malfunctioning sensors). Linear regression with two of the most important predictor variables was not as accurate, but allowed extraction of an interpretable model. The system was implemented in Google Cloud Platform and a model was trained continuously through the season. An online irrigation dashboard was created showing previous and forecast soil moisture conditions, along with weather and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This was used to guide operators in advance of irrigation water needs. The methodology developed in this study could be used as part of a closed-loop sensing and irrigation automation system.",2019,IFAC-PapersOnLine
Taming the Factor Zoo: A Test of New Factors,"We propose a model-selection method to systematically evaluate the contribution to asset pricing of any new factor, above and beyond what a high-dimensional set of existing factors explains. Our methodology explicitly accounts for potential model-selection mistakes, unlike the standard approaches that assume perfect variable selection, which rarely occurs in practice and produces a bias due to the omitted variables. We apply our procedure to a set of factors recently discovered in the literature. While most of these new factors are found to be redundant relative to the existing factors, a few â€” such as profitability â€” have statistically significant explanatory power beyond the hundreds of factors proposed in the past. In addition, we show that our estimates and their significance are stable, whereas the model selected by simple LASSO is not.",2020,Journal of Finance
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit from Noisy Measurements : A New Analysis âˆ—,"A well-known analysis of Tropp and Gilbert shows that orthog onal matching pursuit (OMP) can recover ak-sparsen-dimensional real vector fromm = 4k log(n) noise-free linear measurements obtained through a random G aussian measurement matrix with a probability that approaches one a s n â†’ âˆž. This work strengthens this result by showing that a lower number o f measurements, m = 2k log(n âˆ’ k), is in fact sufficient for asymptotic recovery. More generally, when the sparsity level satisfies kmin â‰¤ k â‰¤ kmax but is unknown, m = 2kmax log(n âˆ’ kmin) measurements is sufficient. Furthermore, this number of measurements is also sufficient for detection of the spars ity pattern (support) of the vector with measurement errors provided the signal-t o-noise ratio (SNR) scales to infinity. The scaling m = 2k log(nâˆ’ k) exactly matches the number of measurements required by the more complex lasso method for s ignal recovery in a similar SNR scaling.",2009,
Factor analysis and prediction of crowdfunding project funding ratio: an empirical study based on Zhongchou Wang in China,"Abstract This study aims at revealing the factors that may influence the funding ratio of crowdfunding (CF) projects based on Zhongchou Wang platform. We construct a variable set which includes the sponsors factors and netizens factors. Based on the TF-IDF method, we determine the exact type of projects in each category. Based on univariate test and lasso regression model, our empirical study suggests that both netizens and sponsors can influence the funding ratio of the five categories of CF projects respectively. Furthermore, our analysis highlights that a positive netizenâ€™s reaction toward the CF project shown on the platform increases the funding ratio of it. Besides, there are several types and regions of each category that receives higher funding ratio than others. These findings help the sponsors to make proper decisions, and to increase the funding ratio of each CF project.",2019,
Detecting potential signals of adverse drug events from prescription data,"Abstract Adverse drug events (ADEs) may occur and lead to severe consequences for the public, even though clinical trials are conducted in the stage of pre-market. Computational methods are still needed to fulfil the task of pharmacosurveillance. In post-market surveillance, the spontaneous reporting system (SRS) has been widely used to detect suspicious associations between medicines and ADEs. However, the passive mechanism of SRS leads to the hysteresis in ADE detection by SRS based methods, not mentioning the acknowledged problem of under-reporting and duplicate reporting in SRS. Therefore, there is a growing demand for other complementary methods utilising different types of healthcare data to assist with global pharmacosurveillance. Among those data sources, prescription data is of proved usefulness for pharmacosurveillance. However, few works have used prescription data for signalling ADEs. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to discover medicines that are responsible for a given ADE purely from prescription data. Our method uses a logistic regression model to evaluate the associations between up to hundreds of suspected medicines and an ADE spontaneously and selects the medicines possessing the most significant associations via Lasso regularisation. To prepare data for training the logistic regression model, we adapt the design of the case-crossover study to construct case time and control time windows for the extraction of medicine use information. While the case time window can be readily determined, we propose several criteria to select the suitable control time windows providing the maximum power of comparisons. In order to address confounding situations, we have considered diverse factors in medicine utilisation in terms of the temporal effect of medicine and the frequency of prescription, as well as the individual effect of patients on the occurrence of an ADE. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we conducted a case study with a real-world prescription dataset. Validated by the existing domain knowledge, our method successfully traced a wide range of medicines that are potentially responsible for the ADE. Further experiments were also carried out according to a recognised gold standard, our method achieved a sensitivity of 65.9% and specificity of 96.2%.",2020,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine
A novel approach to esophageal stent removal in the setting of proximal stenosis and failure of the primary retrieval mechanism.,"A 75-year-old woman was admitted for the extraction of an esophageal fully covered metal stent (upper esophageal sphincter stent [80Ã—20mm]; LeufenMedical, Berlin, Germany). The stent had been implanted 5 weeks earlier to treat an esophageal perforation sustained during bougienage of a benign proximal esophageal stenosis. The location of the stent was distal to the stricture, so that only a transnasal endoscope (EG-530NW [5.1-mm outer diameter and 2.0-mm working channel]; Fujifilm Europe, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany) could be passed. Only a small biopsy forceps (FB-21K-1; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was available for stent manipulation. The upper retrieval loop of the stent was grasped with the forceps, but the loop was destroyed while traction was applied to remove the stent. Using a biopsy forceps, we carried a 0.035-in guidewire (Jagwire; Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) into the esophagus parallel to the endoscope. The guidewire was pushed through the distal retrieval loop (â—"" Fig.1a,b) and then grasped with the forceps on the other side of the loop (â—"" Fig.2). Subsequently, the guidewire was pulled out through the patientâ€™s mouth, forming a loop (â—"" Fig.3). With traction applied to the guidewire loop, the stent was now removed from the esophagus by inversion (peeled away) (â—"" Fig.4,â—"" Video 1). Several techniques have been described as alternatives to stent removal with a proximal retrieval loop. Retrieval of a stent from the stomach with a polypectomy snare (lasso technique) is used mostly when a stent has migrated, and in our case, it would have been necessary to use traction first to move the stent into the stomach [1]. Inversion of the stent, as in our case, reduces the shearing forces on the surrounding esophageal tissue and has been described previously [2,3]. Fig.1 After failure of the primary stent retrieval mechanism in a patient with a proximal esophageal stenosis, a forceps is used to: a carry a guidewire alongside the endoscope; and b pass it through the distal retrieval loop of the stent.",2015,Endoscopy
