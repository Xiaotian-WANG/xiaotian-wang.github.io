Sparsity oracle inequalities for the Lasso,"This paper studies oracle properties of l1-penalized least squares in nonparametric regression setting with random design. We show that the penalized least squares estimator satisfies sparsity oracle inequalities, i.e., bounds in terms of the number of non-zero components of the oracle vec- tor. The results are valid even when the dimension of the model is (much) larger than the sample size and the regression matrix is not positive definite. They can be applied to high-dimensional linear regression, to nonparamet- ric adaptive regression estimation and to the problem of aggregation of arbitrary estimators.

Predictive Correlation Screening: Application to Two-stage Predictor Design in High Dimension,"We introduce a new approach to variable selection, called Predictive Correlation Screening, for predictor design. Predictive Correlation Screening (PCS) implements false positive control on the selected variables, is well suited to small sample sizes, and is scalable to high dimensions. We establish asymptotic bounds for Familywise Error Rate (FWER), and resultant mean square error of a linear predictor on the selected variables. We apply Predictive Correlation Screening to the following two-stage predictor design problem. An experimenter wants to learn a multivariate predictor of gene expressions based on successive biological samples assayed on mRNA arrays. She assays the whole genome on a few samples and from these assays she selects a small number of variables using Predictive Correlation Screening. To reduce assay cost, she subsequently assays only the selected variables on the remaining samples, to learn the predictor coefficients. We show superiority of Predictive Correlation Screening relative to LASSO and correlation learning (sometimes popularly referred to in the literature as marginal regression or simple thresholding) in terms of performance and computational complexity.",2013,
The effect of some additives on histological changes of broiler chicks,"This study was conducted to investigate the effects of feed additives on weight and histological changes in the small intestine. A total of (350) broiler chicks one â€“day old (Ross 380) â€“ unsexed were randomly divided into (7) equal dietary treatment groups, as follows: Treatment (T1): Basal diet without any addition (control group) ,Treatment (T2): Basal diet + Garlic 4cc/10L,Treatment(T3):Basal diet + Saccharomyces cervisiae 2.5gm/10L,Treatment (T4): Basal diet + Stpire 2.5cc/10 L, Treatment (T5): Basal diet +B. glucan 8gm/10 kg, Treatment (T6): Basal diet + Levamisole 1gm/kg, Treatment (T6): Basal diet + Levamisole 1gm/kg, Treatment (T7): Basal diet + Neomycin 0.5 gm/L. These additions were presented on the first day of the arrival for 5 days, and on the day of first vaccination for 5 days and at the end of the experiment for 5 days also. These chicks vaccinated with NDV on the day one of age by injection in the neck and re-vaccinated at day 10 of age with Lassota, Body weight was weekly determined the results as following: Chicks feed a diet with (T7) showed improvement in villus height and in the (T3, T4).",2018,
Scene Labeling Using Sparse Precision Matrix,"Scene labeling task is to segment the image into meaningful regions and categorize them into classes of objects which comprised the image. Commonly used methods typically find the local features for each segment and label them using classifiers. Afterwards, labeling is smoothed in order to make sure that neighboring regions receive similar labels. However, these methods ignore expressive connections between labels and non-local dependencies among regions. In this paper, we propose to use a sparse estimation of precision matrix (also called concentration matrix), which is the inverse of covariance matrix of data obtained by graphical lasso to find interaction between labels and regions. To do this, we formulate the problem as an energy minimization over a graph, whose structure is captured by applying sparse constraint on the elements of the precision matrix. This graph encodes (or represents) only significant interactions and avoids a fully connected graph, which is typically used to reflect the long distance associations. We use local and global information to achieve better labeling. We assess our approach on three datasets and obtained promising results.",2016,2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
Regularized estimation in the accelerated failure time model with high-dimensional covariates.,"We consider two regularization approaches, the LASSO and the threshold-gradient-directed regularization, for estimation and variable selection in the accelerated failure time model with multiple covariates based on Stute's weighted least squares method. The Stute estimator uses Kaplan-Meier weights to account for censoring in the least squares criterion. The weighted least squares objective function makes the adaptation of this approach to multiple covariate settings computationally feasible. We use V-fold cross-validation and a modified Akaike's Information Criterion for tuning parameter selection, and a bootstrap approach for variance estimation. The proposed method is evaluated using simulations and demonstrated on a real data example.",2006,Biometrics
Strategies to Motivate Behavior Change: How Can We Mobilize Adults to Promote Positive Youth Development?,"There is little doubt that the healthy development of young people is an essential feature of a healthy, well-functioning society and that the adult members of society play a critical role in this process (Lerner, Dowling, & Anderson, 2003; Rhodes, Bogat, Roffman, Edelman,&Galasso, 2002). National surveys have consistently shown that adults recognize the importance of devoting both time and effort to activities that contribute to youth development. For example, an overwhelming majority of adults believe it is very important that they encourage children and youth to succeed in school (90%), teach them shared values (80%), and set boundaries for their behavior (84%) (Scales, 2003). However, there is a stark disconnect between peopleâ€™s beliefs about what is important and their own actions. Scales (2003) found that only 69% of adults encouraged success in school, only 45% taught shared values, and only 42% set boundaries for behavior. Given the premise that adult involvement in young peopleâ€™s lives is a critical determinant of healthy development, the observed gap betweenpeopleâ€™s beliefs and their behavior is a clear sign that strategies that can enhance adult involvement in activities that promote the development of young people are needed. In this chapter, we examine the challenge of designing initiatives that can effectivelymobilize adults to act on their beliefs andmake an active contribution to the healthy development of young people. This chapter is divided into two sections. First, given the observed dissociation between peopleâ€™s beliefs and their behavior, we consider what aspects of involvement should be targeted in",2006,

Shrinkage Estimation in Partially Linear Models with Measurement Error,"In practice, measurement error in the covariates is often encountered. Measurement error has several effects when using ordinary least squares for the regression problems. In this thesis, we introduce the basic idea of correcting the bias caused by different types of measurement error. We then focus on the variable selection for partially linear models when some of the covariates are measured with additive errors. The bias caused by the measurement error is corrected by subtracting a bias correction term in the squared loss function. Adaptive LASSO is used for the variable selection procedure. The rate of convergence and the asymptotic normality of the estimators resulted by the proposed procedure are established. We also proved that, with the correct choice of the rate of the regularization parameter, the proposed procedure asymptotically performs as well as when the true model is known in advance. This is the so-called oracle properties.",2010,
A novel Markov Blanket-based repeated-fishing strategy for capturing phenotype-related biomarkers in big omics data,"BackgroundWe propose a novel Markov Blanket-based repeated-fishing strategy (MBRFS) in attempt to increase the power of existing Markov Blanket method (DASSO-MB) and maintain its advantages in omic data analysis.ResultsBoth simulation and real data analysis were conducted to assess its performances by comparing with other methods including Ï‡2 test with Bonferroni and B-H adjustment, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and DASSO-MB. A serious of simulation studies showed that the true discovery rate (TDR) of proposed MBRFS was always close to zero under null hypothesis (odds ratioâ€‰=â€‰1 for each SNPs) with excellent stability in all three scenarios of independent phenotype-related SNPs without linkage disequilibrium (LD) around them, correlated phenotype-related SNPs without LD around them, and phenotype-related SNPs with strong LD around them. As expected, under different odds ratio and minor allel frequency (MAFs), MBRFS always had the best performances in capturing the true phenotype-related biomarkers with higher matthews correlation coefficience (MCC) for all three scenarios above. More importantly, since proposed MBRFS using the repeated fishing strategy, it still captures more phenotype-related SNPs with minor effects when non-significant phenotype-related SNPs emerged under Ï‡2 test after Bonferroni multiple correction. The various real omics data analysis, including GWAS data, DNA methylation data, gene expression data and metabolites data, indicated that the proposed MBRFS always detected relatively reasonable biomarkers.ConclusionsOur proposed MBRFS can exactly capture the true phenotype-related biomarkers with the reduction of false negative rate when the phenotype-related biomarkers are independent or correlated, as well as the circumstance that phenotype-related biomarkers are associated with non-phenotype-related ones.",2016,BMC Genetics
Inducibility of atrial tachyarrhythmias after circumferential pulmonary vein isolation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: clinical predictor and outcome during follow-up,"AIMS
We investigated the presence and clinical outcome of inducibility of atrial tachyarrhythmias after circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI) in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).


METHODS AND RESULTS
Sixty patients with symptomatic PAF underwent CPVI guided by 3D mapping and double Lasso technique. After achievement of CPVI, the induction was performed. The left atrium (LA) volume and the isolated LA area around the right and left-sided pulmonary veins were measured by the 3D mapping system. Sustained atrial tachyarrhythmias (>10 min) were induced after CPVI in 17 of 60 patients (28%). Patients with inducible atrial tachyarrhythmias had significantly smaller isolated areas when compared with the group with non-inducible tachyarrhythmias (16.7 +/- 2.3 vs. 18.8 +/- 2.9%, P < 0.05). After the initial procedure, recurrence occurred in 18 of 43 (42%) patients in the non-inducible group and in 7 of 17 (41%) in the inducible group during follow-up. A repeat procedure was performed in all 25 patients with recurrence. Five patients had a recurrence after the repeat procedure during 20.8 +/- 7.5 months, and there was no difference between the two groups.


CONCLUSION
Inducibility of atrial tachyarrhythmias is associated with proportionally smaller isolated area and does not predict the clinical efficacy of CPVI in patients with PAF.",2008,Europace
Predicting clinical symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder based on temporal patterns between and within intrinsic connectivity networks,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder with high prevalence in school-age children. Previously developed machine learning-based methods have discriminated patients with ADHD from normal controls by providing label information of the disease for individuals. Inattention and impulsivity are the two most significant clinical symptoms of ADHD. However, predicting clinical symptoms (i.e., inattention and impulsivity) is a challenging task based on neuroimaging data. The goal of this study is twofold: to build predictive models for clinical symptoms of ADHD based on resting-state fMRI and to mine brain networks for predictive patterns of inattention and impulsivity. To achieve this goal, a cohort of 74 boys with ADHD and a cohort of 69 age-matched normal controls were recruited from the ADHD-200 Consortium. Both structural and resting-state fMRI images were obtained for each participant. Temporal patterns between and within intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) were applied as raw features in the predictive models. Specifically, sample entropy was taken asan intra-ICN feature, and phase synchronization (PS) was used asan inter-ICN feature. The predictive models were based on the least absolute shrinkage and selectionator operator (LASSO) algorithm. The performance of the predictive model for inattention is r=0.79 (p<10-8), and the performance of the predictive model for impulsivity is r=0.48 (p<10-8). The ICN-related predictive patterns may provide valuable information for investigating the brain network mechanisms of ADHD. In summary, the predictive models for clinical symptoms could be beneficial for personalizing ADHD medications.",2017,Neuroscience

In this paper, based-on the simulation graph, we check the language emptiness of a timed automaton to verify whether the relevant real time system satisfies the desired property. The specific work has three steps: the first is to describe the desired property as a timed BuÌˆchi automaton, and synchronize it with its timed system model to get their product automaton which is a timed BuÌˆchi automaton; the next is to use some successor operator to get the product automata's simulation graph; the last is to check the emptiness of lasso paths on this simulation graph to verify the property satisfaction of the timed system.",2012,"2012 6th International Conference on New Trends in Information Science, Service Science and Data Mining (ISSDM2012)"
Nano-TiO2 stability in medium and size as important factors of toxicity in macrophage-like cells.,"TiO2 along with nano-TiO2 are commonly found in consumer products. In vivo studies have observed an accumulation of nano-TiO2 in macrophages. However, characteristics of nano-TiO2 determining toxicity remain unclear. In our study, the cytotoxic effects of 14 diverse nano-TiO2 on THP-1 macrophage-like cells were measured by 3 cytotoxicity assays (MTS, WST-1 and LDH). Total averaged cytotoxicity was calculated using principal component analysis. Characteristics of all 14 nano-TiO2 included hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, shape, polydispersity index (PDI) and concentration; moreover, crystal form, specific surface area and crystallite size were measured for 10 nano-TiO2.The variables affecting cytotoxicity were chosen using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). Except for concentration, PDI in media measured within 1â€¯h after preparation of the nanomaterial dispersion was selected as a variable affecting cytotoxicity: stable dispersion resulted in higher cytotoxic effects. Crystallite size has been shown to have nonlinear effects (particles of sizes between 20 and 60â€¯nm were cytotoxic while smaller and larger ones were not) and thus it has been excluded from LASSO. The shape (particles/fibre) and crystal form did not affect the cytotoxicity. PDI and the nonlinear effect of size could be an explanation for the inconsistencies of the cytotoxicity of nano-TiO2 in various studies.",2019,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA

To achieve this objective, 12 female rabbits Bobo breed, randomly shared into two treatments, control and V ration, were undergone a grouped copulation. To 35 days old, their 40 progenies were shared into 4 batches of 5 rabbits each, between control and V ration. The control received a ration containing the cotton cake. The V ration incorporated cowpea leafs meal to replace some of the cotton cake. The study lasted 6 months. The V ration slightly improved the size of the litter: 5.5 for V ration vs 5.2 rabbits for the control. The pre-weaning mortality rate was 41.9% vs 36.4% and the live weight, before weaning, was 149.3 vs 93.4g at the 7th day and 339.4 vs 292.3g at the 28th day respectively for the V ration and the control. After 12 weeks of fattening, the average values of the V ration compared to those of the control were 66.8 vs 58.2g for the average ingestion, 1914.2 vs 1753.9g for the live weight, the indices of consumption being 4.2 vs 4.8. No significant difference was observed between the averages of the measured parameters. In conclusion, cowpea leafs meal may partially replace cotton cake in the rabbit diet.

"Thermal Bioclimate and Climate Tourism Analysis for Odessa, Black Sea","Climate is a main component of nature that, in addition to being a valuable resource, determines the possibility of development of tourism. Apparently, climate and its characteristics determine touristic demand. Choosing a place for vacation or recreation, tourists primarily prefer an optimal climate and weather conditions. Human-biometeorological resources characterize the connection of climate with a thermal state and health of humans, peculiarities of recreation and health evaluation of the environment. In order to distinguish thermal bioclimate, the physiologically equivalent temperature is used, based on the various meteorological parameters (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and radiation) that reflect the human conditions and the thermal comfort perception. In addition for the analysis of the climatic tourism potential, the Climate-Transfer/Tourism-Information Scheme was applied. The results can be useful for tourists in order to determine the best time to take a vacation based on their recreational activity such as sports, medical, health (thalassotherapy, heliotherapy, balneology etc.) according to bioclimatic conditions and their own preferences.",2015,Geografiska Annaler Series A-physical Geography

Long-term chronic diseases and crash responsibility: a record linkage study.,"OBJECTIVE
To assess the population impact of chronic conditions on the risk of road traffic crashes.


METHODS
Data from three French national databases were extracted and matched: the national health care insurance database, police reports and the national police database of injurious crashes. Exposure to chronic conditions were compared between responsible and nonresponsible drivers. Analysis was performed using the Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method.


RESULTS
69,630 drivers involved in an injurious crash in France between 2005 and 2008, were included. 6210 (8.9%) were suffering from at least one long-term disease. When adjusted for prescription of medicines, blood alcohol, demographic driver characteristics and crash characteristics, increased risk of being responsible for a crash was found in drivers registered in the French healthcare database with the following long-term diseases: epilepsy (odds ratio [OR]=2.53 [1.53-4.20]), type 1 diabetes (OR=1.47) [1.12-1.92], alcoholic liver disease (OR=3.37 [1.40-8.13]), asthma (OR=1.72 [1.13-2.60]) and specific personality disorders (OR=1.35 [1.05-1.74]). No association was found for cardiovascular diseases or Alzheimer's disease.


CONCLUSION
The results update the list of medical conditions that may impair driving skills. However, results should be considered cautiously with regards to potential regulatory driving judgments that could have a negative impact on patients' social life.",2014,Accident; analysis and prevention
Combined Analysis of Phase I and Phase II Data to Enhance the Power of Pharmacogenetic Tests,"We show through a simulation study how the joint analysis of data from phase I and phase II studies enhances the power of pharmacogenetic tests in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. PK profiles were simulated under different designs along with 176 genetic markers. The null scenarios assumed no genetic effect, while under the alternative scenarios, drug clearance was associated with six genetic markers randomly sampled in each simulated dataset. We compared penalized regression Lasso and stepwise procedures to detect the associations between empirical Bayes estimates of clearance, estimated by nonlinear mixed effects models, and genetic variants. Combining data from phase I and phase II studies, even if sparse, increases the power to identify the associations between genetics and PK due to the larger sample size. Design optimization brings a further improvement, and we highlight a direct relationship between Î·-shrinkage and loss of genetic signal.",2016,CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology
Mystery Ink: A Teacher Self-Study of a Tattoo Art Education Project.,"This project examines the role of the educator involved in a student-centred, art-based project aimed to increase learning and engagement for at-risk youth in a rural high school. Specifically, a tattoo parlour business in an alternative classroom for at-risk youth was designed, implemented, and studied. In conducting the project, the researcher sought to establish how theory can drive a practical, hands-on project that can be integrated into an alternative classroom setting. This self-study project is inspired by the researcherâ€™s personal educational history and a desire to approach learning from a different angle than that imposed by standardized curriculum and evaluation. It begins with the premise that at-risk youth, who are not served by the mainstream learning path, require a curriculum that targets their interests and motivates them to stay in school. An important corollary to art education, engagement, and at-risk youth is the importance of play in the learning process. The results are examined using Lassonde (2009) and Samaras (2011) self-study methodology and the final outcome of the project includes a teaching portfolio that provides clear instructions for other art educators or alternative educators who wish to incorporate the project into their schools.",2017,
On the asymptotic properties of SLOPE,"Sorted L-One Penalized Estimator (SLOPE) is a relatively new convex optimization procedure for selecting predictors in large data bases. Contrary to LASSO, SLOPE has been proved to be asymptotically minimax in the context of sparse high-dimensional generalized linear models. Additionally, in case when the design matrix is orthogonal, SLOPE with the sequence of tuning parameters $\lambda^{BH}$, corresponding to the sequence of decaying thresholds for the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction, provably controls False Discovery Rate in the multiple regression model. In this article we provide new asymptotic results on the properties of SLOPE when the elements of the design matrix are iid random variables from the Gaussian distribution. Specifically, we provide the conditions, under which the asymptotic FDR of SLOPE based on the sequence $\lambda^{BH}$ converges to zero and the power converges to 1. We illustrate our theoretical asymptotic results with extensive simulation study. We also provide precise formulas describing FDR of SLOPE under different loss functions, which sets the stage for future results on the model selection properties of SLOPE and its extensions.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Structure of the FH2 domain of Daam1: implications for formin regulation of actin assembly.,"Daam1 (dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis-1) is a diaphanous-related formin first studied as a novel dishevelled binding protein and shown to be crucial for the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway in Xenopus. Daam1, like other formins, directs nucleation and elongation of new actin filaments using its conserved formin-homology-2 (FH2) domain. Here we report the crystal structure of a large C-terminal fragment of human Daam1 containing the FH2 domain. The structure, determined at 2.25 A resolution using the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing method, reveals a ""tethered dimer"" architecture that is similar to that previously described for the FH2 domain of the yeast formin Bni1, which shares approximately 21% sequence identity with Daam1. Despite the overall similarity with the dimeric FH2 domain of Bni1 and with a truncated monomeric structure of mDia1, the Daam1 FH2 structure reveals a number of differences in secondary structure elements and in the ""lasso/post"" dimerization interface that may be functionally important. Most strikingly, the two halves of the crystallographic dimer pack together in a manner that occludes their actin binding surfaces. This ""locked"" conformation is stabilized by two novel, interacting beta-strands formed by the ends of the linkers that connect the two sides of the dimer. The Daam1 FH2 domain has weak actin assembly activity as compared with other mammalian formins, but mutations that disrupt the beta-strand lock increase activity about tenfold to a level comparable to other formins, suggesting that this occluded conformation may represent an auto-inhibited conformation of the Daam1 FH2 domain.",2007,Journal of molecular biology
"The ichnocoenosis of the bottom nepheloid layer (BNL) deposits: a case study from the Scaglia Toscana Formation (Paleogene, central Italy)","Some fine-grained sediments from the Eocene in age Scaglia Toscana Formation in the Northern Apennines (Trasimeno area), previously interpreted as mud-silt turbidites, have been reinterpreted herein as bottom nepheloid layers (BNL). They contain a rich ichnocoenosis dominated by endichnial forms, that formed progressively in line with the slow accumulation rate of mud transported by the oceanic thermohaline bottom currents. In a BNL idealized sequence, a slight upward increasing density of trace fossils, suggests some differences with typical muddy turbidites. Together with sedimentary structures, trace fossils form an ichno-sedimentary sequence through the bed, which is explained by a step by step colonization that accompanies deposition of the bottom nepheloid layer by continuous currents. It is possible that these ichnological features are recurrent and helpful in recognition of similar deposits within other geological contexts. RIASSUNTO [Icnocenosi degli strati nefeloidi di fondo: un esempio dalla Scaglia Toscana (Paleogene, Italia centrale)] Alcuni sedimenti a granulometria fine, presenti nella Formazione della Scaglia Toscana dellâ€™Appenino settentrionale (area del lago Trasimeno), in precedenza reinterpretati come torbiditi fangose, vengono reinterpretate qui come depositi prodotti da correnti di fondo o strati nefeloidi di fondo (BNL, â€œbottom nepheloid layersâ€).

All Dicom data from Henri IVâ€™s original mummified head axial CT scan were imported into Osirix Dicom viewer (Pixmeo; Geneva, Switzerland) and exported in OBJ format to Zbrush 3-dimensional package (Pixologic, USA). The remaining soft tissues were peeled off until reaching the skull bones.

In some cases, the matrix filling precludes one from observing the endocranial cavity and the internal features of the skull. Computed tomography enabled us to reconstruct electronically its endocast, representing the 3-dimensional surface of the imprints left by the brain on the internal surface of the skull, with its superficialassociated vascularization (sinuses including a bipartite torcular herophili, the presence of a sigmoid sinus, meningeal vessels, and pacchionian granulations) (Fig. 1). Classical morphometric data were quantified on this endocast.

Quantitative Evaluations of the Tubular Epithelium in the Testis of the Fallow Deer (Dama dama),"Contents: The quantitative morphology of the seminiferous epithelium was studied in 10 testes of 16- to 17-monthsold fallow bucks (Dama dama). Seminiferous tubules constitute 77.2% of the testicular parenchyma and amount to a total length of 400â€“750 m per testis. According to varying cell associations 6 different stages can be observed during the spermatogenic cycle. The average tubular diameter varies between 215 Î¼m (stage 1) and 230 Î¼m (stage 8), the epithelial height between 67.6 Î¼m in stage 3 and 71.9 Î¼m in stage 8 when spermiation occurs. From primary spermatocytes during the prophase of the first meiotic division preleptotenes have smallest nuclear (203.7 Î¼m3) and cellular (469.1 Î¼m3) volumes, whereas late diplotenes show a nuclear volume of 846.7Î¼m3 and a cellular volume of 3440.5 Î¼m3, that is an increase of more than 4 times for the nucleus and more than 7 times for the cell body. Numerical analysis reveals 4 spermatogonial divisions and a considerable loss of spermatogenic cells during the second meiotic division and subsequent spermiogenesis. Sertoli cells constitute between 31.4% (stage 4) and 38.3% (stage 1) of the tubular epithelium. The calculated cell volume of an individual Sertoli cell increases during every cycle from 6515.3 Î¼m3 instage 3 to 8350.0 Î¼m3 in stage 8; that is a volume change of 22%. The Sertoli cell organelle with most prominent cyclical variations is the endoplasmic reticulum. A lipid cycle is absent in the seminiferous epithelium of the fallow deer.

Tubuli seminiferi machen 77,2% des Hodenparenchyms aus; die Gesamttubuluslange pro Hoden betragt zwischen 400 und 750 m. Sechs Spermatogenesestadien konnen beim Damhirsch identifiziert werden, wobei fur diese Einteilung wechselnde Zellassoziationen im Keimepithel zugrunde gelegt wurden. Der Durchmesser der Tubuli seminiferi wechselt zwischen 215 Î¼m (Phase 1)und 230 Î¼m (Phase 8). Die Tubulusepithelhohe schwankt ebergfalls zwischen 67,6 Î¼m in Phase 3 und 71,9 Î¼m in Phase 8 (Spermiation). Praleptotane habendie kleinsten Kern- und Zellvolumina (203,7 Î¼m3 bzw. 469,1 Î¼m3) von allen Spermatozyten I. Ordnung, Diplotane aus Phase 4 die grosten Werte (846,7 Î¼m3 bzw. 3440,5 Î¼m3), das ist ein Zuwachs um das Vierfache bei mKern und um das Siebenfache beim Zeilleib. Eine numerische Anaiyse derZellzahlen in Tubulusquerschnitten aus den verschiedenen Phasen der Spermatogenese erlaubt die Schlusfolgerung, das es 4 Spermatogonienteilungen bei dieser Spezies gibt, und das eine betrachtliche Anzahl aller rechnerisch moglichen Keimzellen wahrend der Spermatokenese verloren geht, vor allem wahrend der zweiten Reifeteilung und der Spermiogenese. 
 
 
 
Sertolizellen machen zwischen 31,4 (Phase 4) und 38,3% (Phase 1) des Keimepithels aus. Eine Sertolizelle aus Phase 3 besitzt ein rechnerisches Zellvolumen von 6515,3 Î¼m3, eine Zelle aus Phase 8 ein Zellvolumen von 8350,0 Î¼m3. Somit verringert und vergrosert sich das Volumen der einzelnen Sertolizelle um ca. 22% in jedem Keimepithelzyklus. Das endoplasmatische Retikulum der Sertolizelle ist das Organell mit den auffalligsten zyklischen Veranderungen. Der Lipidgehalt des Keimepithels ist minimal; ein Lipidzyklus im Keimepithel, wie fur andere Spezies beschrieben, existiert beim Damwild nicht.",1993,Reproduction in Domestic Animals
"Biosynthesis, Regulation and Export of Lasso Peptides","Lasso peptides are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) produced by bacteria. As such, they are synthesized as linear precursor peptides, which are further subjected to posttranslational modifications and transformed into the mature form. These 15â€“24-residue peptides share a unique interlocked topology formed by an N-terminal macrolactam ring where the C-terminal tail is threaded and irreversibly trapped. However, access to such a constrained and entropically disfavoured topology is not possible by chemical means, while bacteria evolve specific enzymes that are capable of transforming a linear precursor into the lasso topology. This chapter describes current knowledge of the maturation mechanism, which includes the characteristics of the maturation enzymes and accessory enzymes, the role of the leader peptides and a proposed reaction model. Moreover, this chapter reviews known mechanisms of the regulation and export of lasso peptides.",2015,
Sparse modeling approach to obtaining the shear viscosity from smeared correlation functions,"We propose the sparse modeling method to estimate the spectral function from the smeared correlation functions. We give a description of how to obtain the shear viscosity from the correlation function of the renormalized energy-momentum tensor (EMT) measured by the gradient flow method ($C(t,\tau)$) for the quenched QCD at finite temperature. The measurement of the renormalized EMT in the gradient flow method reduces a statistical uncertainty thanks to its property of the smearing. However, the smearing breaks the sum rule of the spectral function and the over-smeared data in the correlation function may have to be eliminated from the analyzing process of physical observables. In this work, we demonstrate that the sparse modeling analysis in the intermediate-representation basis (IR basis), which connects between the Matsubara frequency data and real frequency data. It works well even using very limited data of $C(t,\tau)$ only in the fiducial window of the gradient flow. We utilize the ADMM algorithm which is useful to solve the LASSO problem under some constraints. We show that the obtained spectral function reproduces the input smeared correlation function at finite flow-time. Several systematic and statistical errors and the flow-time dependence are also discussed.",2020,arXiv: High Energy Physics - Lattice
"Genomic prediction of sugar content and cane yield in sugar cane clones in different stages of selection in a breeding program, with and without pedigree information","High cane yield and commercially extractable sucrose (CCS) content are two of the key sugarcane commercial traits selected in sugarcane breeding programs. Advancements in genomic prediction may provide opportunities to speed up gains for these traits in breeding programs by combining accurate prediction of breeding values in candidate parent clones shortening generation intervals. Selection trials in commercial breeding programs may provide training populations for developing genomic predictions. In this study, three different populations of clones in early and advanced stage selection trials in an established commercial sugarcane breeding program were used to assess genomic prediction accuracy. The clones (genotypes) were evaluated for cane yield and sugar content in field trials and genotyped using a SNP array developed for sugarcane cultivars and parents. Five models (Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayesian LASSO, Bayesian GBLUP and RKHS) were tested using pedigree and/or marker data. Prediction models that included marker information had higher prediction accuracies than models with pedigree data only. For CCS, the prediction accuracies for genotypes in advanced stage trials using DNA markers were superior compared with prediction accuracies for early-stage trials, suggesting that prior intensive selection for CCS did not diminish accuracy of genomic prediction. However, by contrast, for cane yield, the prediction accuracies were much less for the population in the advanced stages of selection. The levels of prediction accuracy obtained in most datasets (0.25â€“0.45) are encouraging for developing applications of genomic prediction to predict breeding values of yield and sugar content in sugarcane breeding programs.",2020,Molecular Breeding
Tendon transfers as applied to tetraplegia.,"The techniques of the tendon transfers that are used primarily for the functional rehabilitation of upper limbs in tetraplegia are described in this article. The restoration of active elbow extension can be obtained either by biceps-to-triceps or by deltoid-to-triceps transfers. Grasp and key grip can be restored either by active or by passive tendon transfers. The usual motors of active transfer are the BR and ECRL. The usual tenodesis involve the FDS (via lassos), EDC, EPL, FPL, and APL.",2002,Hand clinics
Scalable Electronic Phenotyping For Studying Patient Comorbidities,"Over 75 million Americans have multiple concurrent chronic conditions and medical decision making for these patients is mostly based on retrospective cohort studies. Current methods to generate cohorts of patients with comorbidities are neither scalable nor generalizable. We propose a supervised machine learning algorithm for learning comorbidity phenotypes without requiring manually created training sets. First, we generated myocardial infarction (MI) and type-2 diabetes (T2DM) patient cohorts using ICD9-based imperfectly labeled samples upon which LASSO logistic regression models were trained. Second, we assessed the effects of training sample size, inclusion of physician input, and inclusion of clinical text features on model performance. Using ICD9 codes as our labeling heuristic, we achieved comparable performance to models created using keywords as labeling heuristic. We found that expert input and higher training sample sizes could compensate for the lack of clinical text derived features. However, our best performing model included clinical text as features with a large training sample size.",2018,AMIA ... Annual Symposium proceedings. AMIA Symposium
Mechanisms of density- and number-dependent population regulation of a coral-reef fish,"Density-dependent post-settlement losses are a common feature of many reef fish populations, and resent observations suggest that losses may also scale with population size independent of density (i.e. 'number-dependence'). Despite the potential importance of these two forms of compensatory loss, there have been relatively few attempts to determine the mechanisms underlying these demographic patterns. A factorial experiment was conducted to test whether density- and/or number-dependent losses observed for newly settled six bar wrasse (Thalassoma hardwicke) are attributable to predation or another factor (e.g. migration). Losses of recently settled fish from reefs within predator exclosures were âˆ¼26% over a 7-day period and apparently independent of density and number of residents. Losses from reefs that were accessible to predators averaged âˆ¼62% over 7 days, and were dependent upon both the density and number of resident fish. Behavioural observations indicate the frequency of agonistic interactions between resident six-bar wrasse scales with the number of fish independent of density. Overall, results attribute both density-and number-dependent losses to predation, and suggest that number-dependent behavioural interactions (perhaps important for the social control of sex change) rather than proximate resource limitation may underlie observed number-dependent mortality.

A modified area under the ROC curve and its application to marker selection and classification,"Abstract The area under the ROC curve (AUC) can be interpreted as the probability that the classification scores of a diseased subject is larger than that of a non-diseased subject for a randomly sampled pair of subjects. From the perspective of classification, we want to find a way to separate two groups as distinctly as possible via AUC. When the difference of the scores of a marker is small, its impact on classification is less important. Thus, a new diagnostic/classification measure based on a modified area under the ROC curve (mAUC) is proposed, which is defined as a weighted sum of two AUCs, where the AUC with the smaller difference is assigned a lower weight, and vice versa. Using mAUC is robust in the sense that mAUC gets larger as AUC gets larger as long as they are not equal. Moreover, in many diagnostic situations, only a specific range of specificity is of interest. Under normal distributions, we show that if the AUCs of two markers are within similar ranges, the larger mAUC implies the larger partial AUC for a given specificity. This property of mAUC will help to identify the marker with the higher partial AUC, even when the AUCs are similar. Two nonparametric estimates of an mAUC and their variances are given. We also suggest the use of mAUC as the objective function for classification, and the use of the gradient Lasso algorithm for classifier construction and marker selection. Application to simulation datasets and real microarray gene expression datasets show that our method finds a linear classifier with a higher ROC curve than some other existing linear classifiers, especially in the range of low false positive rates.",2014,Journal of The Korean Statistical Society
Reply to: Misoprostol during cesarean delivery: At which time and by which route?,"We appreciate the interest shown by Dr. Shehata in our recently published paper [1]. We would like to thank him for his valuable comments that add much more to our own published findings. Regarding the cost of misoprostol, we disagree with the author that misoprostol is costly than oxytocin wherever in Egypt or worldwide. A recent study demonstrated that the mean cost of misoprostol was significantly lower than the oxytocin (2.0 Â± 0.8 vs. 5.1 Â± 0.9 US dollars; P < 0.00001) [2]. Additionally, Vlassoff et al., 2016 in reported that misoprostol was more cost effective than oxytocin when given prophylactically after vaginal delivery in low-resource setting; Senegal similar to Egypt [3]. Shehata states that misoprostol costs one Dollar while one oxytocin ampoule costs 0.25 Dollar, although he provides no citations to prove this. Shehata states that the large systematic review by CondeAgudelo et al. [2] reported no statistically significant differences between misoprostol and oxytocin in reducing intraoperative and postoperative bleeding at cesarean delivery. We agree with him, but the review included four clinical trials; one of them showed a significant reduction in the mean postoperative blood loss with sublingual misoprostol (MD 1â„4 23 ml; P < 0.00001) [4]. In the other 3 studies, there was a lower mean intraoperative blood loss with sublingual misoprostol (MD 1â„4 55 ml) although it was not statistically significant; P 1â„4 0.07. This coincides with our study results; however we reported a statistically significant lower blood loss with misoprostol (MD 1â„4 111 ml, P 1â„4 0.025) [1]. On the other hand, the mentioned meta-analysis byMousa et al. [5] was evaluating the role of misoprostol in treatment of primary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), unlike our study which evaluated its prophylactic role in PPH. Finally, Conde-Agudelo et al.

Population structure and gene flow in Bermudaâ€™s reef fish,"The source of recruits to populations of three reef fish species found in Bermuda, Haemulon flavolineatum, Abudefduf saxatilis and Thalassoma bifasciatum were examined through the technique of allozyme electrophoresis. Levels of genetic variation observed were within the range recorded for other marine teleosts. Allelic frequencies were compared between populations sampled from Bermuda, Miami, Bahamas and Barbados; no evidence of significant heterogeneity was observed between these populations of Abudefduf saxatilis and Thalassoma bifasciatum; however indications of population substructuring were observed in Haemulon flavolineatum, suggesting that gene flow was restricted and that genetic divergence in the Bermuda population had occurred. Reports in the literature indicate that this species has a relatively short larval residence period of two weeks, and it is proposed that this may not be sufficiently long to allow â€˜foreignâ€™ recruits to migrate to Bermuda. It may be inferred from this that the population of H. flavolineatum in Bermuda is largely self-replenishing, and if the limiting factor is the pelagic larval duration (PLD), then other species with similarly short PLDâ€™s might be expected to show evidence of stock heterogeneity. This study confirms the need for stringent local fisheries management policies, and adds further support for the implementation of a local fish pot ban in 1990. INTRODUCTION Despite their diversity, coral reef fish exhibit a remarkable uniformity in one aspect of their life history. With only one known exception (Acanthochromis polyacanthus), reef fish produce pelagic larvae, which spend variable periods of time (from two weeks to several months (Thresher, 1984)) in the water column prior to metamorphosing and entering the second phase of the life history, a fairly sedentary, site-attached existence among shallow reefs (Sale, 1978). The presence of coral reef fish around oceanic islands isolated by hundreds of miles from any possible source of propagules, suggests that the larval stages may be capable of significant, long-distance dispersal. Indeed, observations on the spawning behaviour of many fish has led to the suggestion that reef fish employ Proceedings of the 47th Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute 401 tactics which actually encourage such dispersal either to avoid predation by reefdwelling planktivorous fish (Johannes, 1978), or to transport larvae to favourable feeding areas (Kiorboe et al., 1985), or as an adaptation to the instability of most reef systems, allowing colonisation of more favourable habitats and incidentally maintaining gene flow (Crisp, 1978; Barlow, 1981; Doherty et al., 1985). However, offsetting the advantages of long range dispersal, is the higher mortality associated with increasing planktonic residence time, and hence loss of potential recruits. Indeed evidence has been presented which suggests that dispersal is responsible for enormous losses of fish larvae (Nelson et al., 1977; Sinclair et al., 1985; Peterman and Bradford, 1987; Walsh, 1987). Traditionally, it has been assumed that the supply of reef fish larvae competent to settle is in excess of the resources available to those larvae after settlement, however recent studies have revealed a number of recruitment-limited assemblages in which there are insufficient larvae settling from the plankton to saturate the available resources (Williams, 1980; Doherty, 1981 and Victor, 1983; Milicich et al., 1992). This presents a particularly significant problem for isolated fish populations. The production of pelagic larvae would thus appear to serve two opposing demands, ensuring that sufficient numbers of larvae are retained within their natal reef to maintain the local population, whilst allowing some to escape to ensure gene flow. The extent of dispersal will be the product of the spawning behaviour of adults, hydrography, reef topography, behavioural characteristics of the larvae (in particular swimming behaviour on a vertical and horizontal scale), larval duration and predation. It will influence not only fish abundance on a local scale, but also large-scale distribution patterns and the genetic structure of natural populations. In recent years, techniques of population genetics have been widely applied for the identification of geographically isolated fish stocks (Allendorf and Utter, 1979). Conspecific populations which are genetically isolated from each other will tend to evolve along different paths through the processes of genetic drift and natural selection, until eventually they can no longer successfully interbreed (Wright, 1931). Incomplete isolation may result in differentiation between populations within a species. The formulation of effective management strategies will depend on the extent to which a reef population is self-replenishing, or is dependent on recruits from â€˜upstreamâ€™ fisheries. For island fisheries, conditions which lead to the dispersal of larvae away from the island and the recruitment of larvae from â€˜upstreamâ€™ sources, will tend to result in high gene flow between populations. Over time, this will cause low speciation rates and widespread and genetically homogenous species distributions (Scheltema, 1978). At the other extreme, retention of larvae around oceanic islands, with subsequent local Proceedings of the 47th Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute 402 recruitment, will lead to low gene flow, and the potential for genetic differentiation and subsequent endemism (Farmer and Berg, 1989). The isolated island chain of Bermuda presents an ideal study model. Located in the central gyre of the western Atlantic Ocean, Bermuda comprises the worldâ€™s northernmost coral reef system. It is biotically linked with the Caribbean, with a rich fauna and flora, although it does not exhibit the same level of species diversity; several reef fish common in the more tropical waters to the south, are absent locally. Their absence may be due to unsuitable environmental conditions prohibiting successful inhabitation, or it may be the result of BermudaÃ•s geographic isolation; the larvae of certain species may be incapable of undertaking the necessary migration. For those species which are found locally, the question remains as to whether their populations continue to be replenished by recruits from upstream sources, or whether they have become genetically isolated. MATERIALS AND METHODS Collection of specimens Population samples of three species of reef fish, Haemulon flavolineatum, Abudefduf saxatilis and Thalassoma bifasciatum were collected from the Florida Keys, New Providence Bahamas and the west coast of Barbados, to be compared with samples from Bermuda. Collecting techniques varied; traps were employed where possible to collect samples of Haemulon flavolineatum but these were also supplemented by the use of a hook and line; similarly, line fishing was successful in some locations for Abudefduf saxatilis, but in Bermuda and Barbados trapping the schooling fish at the surface within a barrier net proved more effective; SCUBA divers using aquarium dip nets were most successful in collecting all the Thalassoma bifasciatum specimens. Where possible 50 individuals of each species were collected from each site. In Barbados, collection of Haemulon flavolineatum proved difficult, and only 44 specimens were sampled. In Miami, only 4 Abudefduf saxatilis individuals were collected, which was insufficient for electrophoretic analysis. Screening Studies Twenty two enzyme systems were screened to determine firstly the enzyme/buffer/tissue combination giving the best activity and resolution, and secondly, those systems exhibiting protein polymorphism. The enzyme systems selected for the main study were; Aspartate aminotransferase (AAT), Aconitate hydratase (AH), Creatine kinase (CK), Fumarate hydratase (FUM), Glucose-6phosphate isomerase (GPI), Isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), Lactate Proceedings of the 47th Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute 403 dehydrogenase (LDH), Malate dehydrogenase (MDH), Malic enzyme (ME), Phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and 6-phosphoglucose dehydrogenase (6-PGD). Tissue preparation and electrophoresis All fish were kept in aerated water until they were killed, at which time their standard length was measured and their sex determined. The eyeball, a section of skeletal muscle and the liver were removed, placed separately in airtight PVC vials and snap frozen in dry ice. The samples were transported on dry ice back to Bermuda for electrophoretic analysis. The tissues were homogenised in an equal volume of deionised water and centrifuged at approximately 5,000 G in a sero-fuge for 5 minutes at room temperature. Whatman #4 paper wicks were soaked in the supernatant for 15 min at 4 oC and then inserted into horizontal starch gels (11.3% Sigma Starch) which had been prepared in a microwave. The gel buffer used was 0.005 M Tris-HCl/0.02 M MgCl2 (pH 7.5). Resolution of 11 enzyme systems was achieved using two different buffer systems described in Table 1. The gels were run for 14-17 hours at 4oC in a refrigerator. Enzyme activity was detected by staining of the gels following the procedures of Shaw and Prasad (1970). All staining solutions were incorporated into a 1% agar overlay. The stained gels were incubated at 37oC until the banding patterns were clear enough to be scored. Presumptive gene loci for proteins with a single isozyme expressed were designated by the abbreviation for that enzyme. For proteins encoded by multiple gene loci, the loci were numbered according to decreasing anodal mobility. Allele products were numbered by migratory distance relative to the most common band which was numbered 100. Data interpretation and analysis Two methods were employed to determine that the observed banding patterns were genetic in origin. Firstly, the patterns were compared with those expected from other studies in which the genetic basis of the electrophoretic variation is known; this",2005,
Scleral fixation of a one-piece toric intraocular lens.,"PURPOSE
To describe a novel technique for toric intraocular lens (IOL) repositioning and fixation in the absence of adequate capsular support.


METHODS
Case report and literature review.


RESULTS
Two cases are presented with scleral fixation of a one-piece toric IOL (SN6AT series; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX). In both cases, toric IOLs initially placed within the capsular bag became decentered due to poor capsular support. To avoid the potential complications of lens explantation and maintain the astigmatic benefits of the toric IOL, scleral fixation of the lenses was performed. The Hoffman technique was used to create reverse scleral pockets without conjunctival dissection. A 10-0 non-dissolvable suture was used to capture and then secure the lens haptics in a lasso-type fashion. Sutures were then buried within the previously created scleral pockets. Both patients had well-centered lenses postoperatively that remained stable at last follow-up, 30 months postoperatively.


CONCLUSION
In the absence of adequate capsular support, scleral fixation is a viable option for one-piece toric IOL fixation to avoid IOL explantation.",2013,Journal of refractive surgery

Musical humanism for beginners,"Does Ficino make you dizzy? Does Pythagorean number theory send a chill down your spine? Do the intricacies of tuning systems in the 16th century perplex you? All these and much more are explained in Claude V. Paliscaâ€™s magis terial Humanism in Italian Renaissance musical thought (New Haven, 1985), but for non-specialists the book is rather daunting. Palisca must have realized this himself, for he has now revisited his earlier studies and produced a work that is marvellously informative, lucid and readable, and that should appeal to readers of Early music . When Palisca died unexpectedly in 2001 he had nearly finished the present book, which has been brought to completion by Thomas J. Mathiesen and appears fittingly as the first volume in the Studies in the History of Music Theory and Literature, published by the University of Illinois Press. The task of completing another authorâ€™s work is very difficult, and we all have reason to be grateful to Mathiesen. Reading the book was like listening to Palisca once again. The chapter titles give a good idea of the contents of the book: â€˜ Musical change and intellectual history â€™ , â€˜ Universal harmony â€™ , â€˜ Sense over reason: the anti-theoretical tradition â€™ , â€˜ The poetics of musical composition â€™ , â€˜ Humanist revival of the modes and genera â€™ , â€˜ Humanist reaction to polyphony â€™ , â€˜ Theories of monody and dramatic music â€™ , â€˜ Music and scientific discovery â€™ , â€˜ Ancient and modern: styles and genres â€™ , â€˜ Theories of the affections and imitation â€™ , and â€˜ Music and rhetoric â€™ , followed by an appendix of the principal treatises cited. The title is rather more general than the book itself, for the emphasis is firmly on 16th-century Italy in the first six chapters, and the â€˜ 17th century â€™ does not extend much beyond Monteverdi except in the last two chapters, which also discuss Kircher, Mersenne and Descartes. Sometimes it is startling to come upon earlier discussions that speak aptly to modern concerns, for example performance practice. â€˜ Music and rhetoric â€™ had become a matter of compositional style and analysis for German theoreticians such as Joachim Burmeister ( Musica poetica , 1606), whose theories are applied here to a different example than the one Palisca had used in his earlier book (Lassoâ€™s In me transierunt ). Lassoâ€™s Cum rides mihi offers a telling example of a range of rhetorical ploys; he would probably have been amused to see them analysed in such pompous terms as hypotyposis and pathopoeia . In such pieces the rhetoric is part of the compositional fabric. But earlier writers considered rhetoric more a manner of performance: the term used is pronunciatio , by which one judged an orator. Nicola Vicentino ( Lâ€™antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica , 1555) applies it to music: â€˜ The measure should change according to the words, now slower and now faster. ... The experience of the orator can be instructive, if you observe the technique he follows in his oration. For he speaks now loud and now soft, now slow and now fast, thus greatly moving his listeners. This technique of changing the measure has a powerful effect on the soul â€™ (quoted on p.208; for all translations the original is given in a footnote). We might think this remark relevant only to solo singing, and yet Vicentino writes before the age of monody, and he could very well have vocal ensembles in mind. This is a lesson that should be taken to heart by modern groups, especially in sacred music, where the tendency too often is to sing straight through at the same speed and the same dynamic level. Throughout the book Palisca quotes extensively from the original authors, allowing us to see how they grappled with the problems that interested them. Platoâ€™s maxim that in song ( melos ) the text ( logos ) should govern melody ( harmonia ) and rhythm ( rhythmos ) is a leitmotiv of the whole book. However, most 16th-century readers â€” and even Giulio Cesare Monteverdi â€” depended on Ficinoâ€™s Latin translation, where melos was rendered as melodia , and they misunderstood harmonia in a narrower (and more modern) sense than Plato intended. Nevertheless, the meaning came through: the text should be the mistress of the harmony, the hallmark of the seconda prattica . But considering Vicentinoâ€™s words quoted earlier, was the debate ancient or modern, or was it timeless?",2007,Early Music
Affection Economy and Moral Economy Compared: What Lessons?,"Moral economy may have originated from three sources with elements of comparisons among them to be discussed. First, a South East Asia source (James Scott, 1976) states that any peasant has a specific behavior centered on subsistence because conversely to the case of a capitalist enterprise, he is both a producer and a consumer. Second, in industrialized countries, the key author is Karl Polanyi (1947) and his analysis of the Great Transformation dividing political economy from moral economy. According to him economy is no longer embedded in the social and the cultural but the reverse is true. The third source is Africa and the abundant literature from economic and social anthropology about kinship systems and the social organizations from them. A French anthropological tradition focuses on modes of production and their consequences on the process of value formation: Meillassoux (1964, 1975) and Coquery-Vidrovitch. Whereas, Kopytoff (1987), Berry (1993) and Peters (1994) question the sustainability of local traditional institutions and instead show the ingenuity with which African actors invent anew, discuss, and adapt the values to deal with the challenge of their lives. But it is relevant to consider a complementary concept â€“Â“ ""the economics of affection"" - for a better understanding and analyzing the choices and behaviors in countries where capitalism is not pervasive in the whole society, up to now, and where the dominant form of organization is based on small units and general reciprocity. Despite the emergence of market mechanisms, behaviors and institutions based on investments in relation to others are still operational.",2007,Revue Du Mauss
"The Behavior of the Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Lepomis Gibbosus (Linneaus), With Notes On the Behavior of Other Species of Lepomis and the Pigmy Sunfish, Elassoma Evergladei","The sunfishes, family Centrarchidae, inhabit quiet waters of the eastern and southern United States. They feed chiefly on insects, insect larvae, and small crustaceans. The behavior of Lepomis gibbosus, the pumpkinseed sunfish, and Lepomis humilis, the orangespotted sunfish, the two species studied most extensively, is very similar. The behavior of Lepomis macrochirus, the bluegill sunfish; Lepomis auritus, the redbellied sunfish; Lepomis cyanellus, the green sunfish; and Lepomis megalotis, the longeared sunfish, is compared and contrasted to these two where it is known. M a i n t e n a n c e B e h a v i o r. In aquaria Lepomis learn to eat non-living food. L. gibbosus and humilis sleep with ventral surface from chin to pelvic fin insertion touching bottom and all fins maximally spread. The overall body color is darker than during the day. The comfort movements, yawning, body bending, chafing, various fin movements, jerking, mouth snapping, and coughing (listed in order of their frequency of occurrence in gibbosus), occur more frequently in situations of environmental or social stress. A g o n i s t i c B e h a v i o r. The Lateral Threat Display, in which all median fins and the pelvic fins are broadly spread, usually has a defensive function. The Frontal Threat Display is the most aggressive and frequent behavior in the species of Lepomis observed. The displaying gibbosus erects dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins and moves toward an opponent to thrust, rush, swipe, or chase. Of these four variations of the Frontal Threat Display the most complex motivationally is the thrust employed by males in mutual displays on territory boundaries. Biting movements and Opercle Spreads may accompany most forms of frontal threat. Opercle Spreads usually occur at higher levels of aggressiveness than biting movements and often are especially frequent in situations suggesting motivational conflict. Tail Beating is the least frequent agonistic behavior in gibbosus and humilis but occurs commonly in auritus dominance encounters. The Attitude of Inferiority has three components. The first to appear is leaning to one side while swimming. The second to appear is depressed fins, and finally an inferior fish may become darker in color or acquire dark lateral bars on the sides. Social Groups. Differences in group relationships of different species are described. For example, in aquaria in which two male gibbosus established territories and spawned with three or four female companions, groups of auritus and megalotis of approximately the same individual size and sexual composition always were dominated by one individual which eventually killed all companions. Species differences in kinds and frequency of aggressive behavior also exist. Reproductive e B e h a v i o r. The spawning season is marked by the presence of males on shallow, circular nests, the size, structure, and location of which art described for the species studied. Males defend their nests, and since gibbosus, humilis, and macrochirus build nests in groups (with adjacent nest rims), there are many agonistic encounters between neighboring males. In addition to having agonistic encounters males on nests sweep; bite the substrate; push, pull, and carry plants which encroach upon the nest; court females; spawn; fan eggs; and leave the nest temporarily for a variety of reasons. Sweeping, the nest building movement, is done with the caudal fin which moves back and forth much like a broom. In gibbosus sweeping may occur any time before a male spawns but is especially frequent when neighboring males are threatening, sweeping or spawning and when females approach the nest. L. gibbosus ceases to sweep after spawning, but auritus, humilis, and possibly other species sweep after spawning, interspersing sweeping and fanning, which is a post-spawning behavior. L. gibbosus males begin to fan immediately after they spawn and continue to fan vigorously for 18 to 24 hours. Then fanning gradually ceases, and males hover over eggs and larvae. Possible stimuli for initiating and sustaining fanning are described. Courtship behavior occurs when a female ready to spawn approaches a nest. The male becomes very active and his movements are fast and frequent. The body becomes taut with the caudal peduncle arched upwards. The dorsal, anal, and caudal fins are maximally spread. Pelvic fins are depressed. Body color darkens. The male orients his movements toward the female, circles her, and places himself so that the female is directed into the nest. If the female flees the male may swim rapidly back and forth between her and the nest in courtship posture. Substrate biting occurred regularly but did not contribute to nest construction except in auritus. L. auritus males regularly carry stones from the nest to the outside of the nest, but other Lepomis observed did not. When any other activity of the male increased in frequency, the frequency of occurrence of substrate biting also increased. Rim Circling was a behavior observed in nesting male macrochirus but not in gibbosus. Female pre- and post-spawning behavior is described. Spawning occurs when a female swims into a nest and stays. The male and female then assume positions side by side facing in the same direction. With the female on the inside they swim around and around in a small circle barely above the bottom of the nest. At regular intervals the female tilts her dorsum away from the male and while on her side, rubs the ventral surface near her genital pore quickly against the side of his body near the anal fin. As contact is made eggs and sperm may be shed. Many spawning movements produce no eggs. A typical successful gibbosus spawning lasts 25 to 45 minutes. During this time the male may leave the nest many times in Frontal Threat posture and he may attack the female. The behavior of larvae and young fish is described. Elassoma evergladei, a pigmy sunfish, may reach 4 cm. in total length. They inhabit soft, acid waters of the eastern coastal plain of the United States. In aquaria they eat only living food. They have a distinctive sideways approach to food and snap it up. They have no particular sleeping posture and fewer comfort movements than Lepomis. With suitable aquarium conditions and 15-hour daily photoperiod, this species was always in breeding condition and social interaction was common. Lone aquarium inhabitants and non-breeding fish behave similarly. Individuals remain motionless for hours either resting on the bottom or among plants usually in the darkest part of the habitat. They often do not eat even when food is available. Males are territorial. If there is ample bottom space and if males are nearly equal in size and aggressiveness, boundaries are well defined. Otherwise usually one male dominates other companions. There is one threat display and one courtship display. These consist of complicated fin movements, movements of the fish through space, and color changes.",1963,Behaviour
Orientation Coding by Population of Neurons in Rats' Primary Visual Cortex,"Research on Primate visual cortex (V1 area) neurons orientation coding mechanism is the base of revealing the whole visual cortex information processing mechanism. Firstly, this paper adopted different orientation grating to stimulate visually on rats. Meanwhile, gather response signals of population neurons from V1 area using multi-electrode arrays. Then, screen effective response channels according to the orientation selection of different neurons in different channels. Besides, extract Spike average fire rate and LFPÎ³ band power feature in every effective channel signals within specific stimulus response time to construct population response joint features. Finally, taking Lasso regression model as coding model, use joint features to differentiate grating orientation, in order to research on V1 areas population neurons orientation coding. The consequences indicate that the results of population response joint features coding for six different orientation are superior to the results of any single feature of population response coding, and remarkably better than the results of single channel response feature coding.",2013,Applied Mechanics and Materials
"Variaciones temporales y espaciales en la estructura de la comunidad de peces de arrecifes rocosos del suroeste del Golfo de California, MÃ©xico","Many rocky reefs exist in the Gulf of California; however, there are few studies on the fish communities that inhabit them. In the present work, these communities are evaluated through visual censuses at four sites of the southwestem coast of the gulf. The specifÃ­c richness, frequency, evenness and diversity were analyzed at each site. Seasonal changes and differences among the sites studied were also analyzed. A total of 76 species was registered. Five species were the most abundant in most of the zones and during the greater part of the study: Stegastes spp., Thalassoma lucasanum, Abudefduf troschelii, Chromis atrilobata and Haemulon maculicauda. Only the tirst three species were present in all censuses made. Differences were found in the structure of the communities between different seasons and between study sites; however, the diversity values had no significant differences. The zone with the greatest number of species was Cueva de LeÃ³n. A positive relationship was found between specific richness and temperature.",1996,Ciencias Marinas
POPULATION DENSITY AND THE ECONOMICS OF TERRITORIAL DEFENSE IN A CORAL REEF FISHl,"We propose that in some species, local population density can strongly affect the economic defendability of a mating territory. This is so because the numbers of females and potentially interfering males determine allocations of time and energy to reproduction and defense. At low densities, allocations to defense should be small and territorial mating success should initially rise with local density, reflecting the supply of females. If defense takes priority over mating, higher population densities can create a situation in which the time or energy devoted to defense against other males detracts from allocations to reproduction. Thus a point is reached where territorial mating success declines with increasing density, as a function of the number of nonterritorial males. We investigated these hypotheses by recording changes in the daily mating success of territorial males of the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) following experimental manipulations of local population size and composition. On large reefs, where mating population densities are already high, territorial mating success varied inversely with changes in overall population density and with changes in nonterritorial male numbers only; changes in female numbers had little effect. Thus at higher densities the demands of defense appear to be more important in determining mating success than the supply of available mates. Territorial mating success varied directly with population density changes only on the smallest experimental reef, where there were few nonterritorial males. The reduction of mating success at higher densities was correlated with a decrease in both the time spent in courtship and the efficiency of courtship itself. The effect of population density should be particularly important in species with short breeding periods and where the male contributes relatively little time or energy to each mating.",2008,
The noise barrier and the large signal bias of the Lasso and other convex estimators,"Convex estimators such as the Lasso, the matrix Lasso and the group Lasso have been studied extensively in the last two decades, demonstrating great success in both theory and practice. Two quantities are introduced, the noise barrier and the large scale bias, that provides insights on the performance of these convex regularized estimators. It is now well understood that the Lasso achieves fast prediction rates, provided that the correlations of the design satisfy some Restricted Eigenvalue or Compatibility condition, and provided that the tuning parameter is large enough. Using the two quantities introduced in the paper, we show that the compatibility condition on the design matrix is actually unavoidable to achieve fast prediction rates with the Lasso. The Lasso must incur a loss due to the correlations of the design matrix, measured in terms of the compatibility constant. This results holds for any design matrix, any active subset of covariates, and any tuning parameter. It is now well known that the Lasso enjoys a dimension reduction property: the prediction error is of order $\lambda\sqrt k$ where $k$ is the sparsity; even if the ambient dimension $p$ is much larger than $k$. Such results require that the tuning parameters is greater than some universal threshold. We characterize sharp phase transitions for the tuning parameter of the Lasso around a critical threshold dependent on $k$. If $\lambda$ is equal or larger than this critical threshold, the Lasso is minimax over $k$-sparse target vectors. If $\lambda$ is equal or smaller than critical threshold, the Lasso incurs a loss of order $\sigma\sqrt k$ --which corresponds to a model of size $k$-- even if the target vector has fewer than $k$ nonzero coefficients. Remarkably, the lower bounds obtained in the paper also apply to random, data-driven tuning parameters. The results extend to convex penalties beyond the Lasso.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Herbicide toxicity and microbial responses in soil,"The question mark placed on a few herbicides because of their longer persistence in Black Cotton soil made this ecotoxicological assessment necessary. Since microbial responses can be used as an indicator of herbicide toxicity, soil respiration, dehydrogenase, and viable bacterial counts were used as the parameters to assess herbicide toxicity. Basalin, Lasso, and Tafazine are used in Black Cotton Soil of Southwest part of India. Soils treated with 1,5, and 25 ppm (w/w) and assessed 1, e, 11, 16, and 21 days later, indicated a significant inhibitory effect on microbial activity measured in terms of these parameters. The improvement in soil quality started after 16â€“21 days in Basalin treated soil only. Further, there exists a correlation between soil respiration and number of bacterial colonies, and soil respiration and dehydrogenase activity. The study warrants a rigorous screening of all the recommended preemergence herbicides in Black Cotton soil of this fertile area.",1987,Environmental Toxicology & Water Quality
Accounting for covariate distributions in slope-unit-based landslide susceptibility models. A case study in the alpine environment,"Abstract Thousands or even million of pixels can be contained in a single Slope Unit. Hence, each covariate used in spatial predictive models is characterized by a distribution of values for each Slope Unit. Here, we model the whole covariates' distribution within Slope Units for landslide susceptibility purposes. This is done by finely dissecting each covariate into quantiles and then modeling the susceptibility via a LASSO penalized Binary Logistic Regression. We choose a LASSO penalization because the common Stepwise procedure is not selective enough to shrink a large number of covariates to an interpretable subset (which we also demonstrate here). LASSO mostly selects 6 covariates out of 372 to explain the spatial distribution of shallow landslides in the Upper Badia valley, Italian Alps. This allows us to verify that the selection does not include any quantile close to the median hence, nor to the mean. The latter is the common representation of the covariates' distribution within Slope Units, which we also test and report in the supplements. Overall, we suggest to always investigate the whole distribution because the mean may not be the most informative nor the most performing way to generate Slope-Unit-based susceptibility models. In this general context, we generate our landslide inventory by combining semi-automated (OBIA) and manual mapping procedures. Our inventory, quantile covariates' representation and LASSO penalization produce excellent performances and interpretable relations between covariates and landslides.",2019,Engineering Geology
Distant Metastasis Risk Definition by Tumor Biomarkers Integrated Nomogram Approach for Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,"Identifying metastasis remains a challenge for death control and tailored therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we addressed this by designing a nomogram-based Cox proportional regression model through integrating a panel of tumor biomarkers. A total of 147 locally patients with advanced NPC, derived from a randomized phase III clinical trial, were enrolled. We constructed the model by selecting the variables from 31 tumor biomarkers, including 6 pathological signaling pathway molecules and 3 Epstein-Barr virus-related serological variables. Through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox proportional regression analysis, a nomogram was designed to refine the metastasis risk of each NPC individuals. Using the LASSO Cox regression model, we constructed a 9 biomarkers-based prognostic nomogram: Beclin 1, Aurora-A, Cyclin D1, Ki-67, P27, Bcl-2, MMP-9, 14-3-3Ïƒ, and VCA-IgA. The time-dependence receiver operating characteristic analysis at 1, 3, and 5 years showed an appealing prognostic accuracy with the area under the curve of 0.830, 0.827, and 0.817, respectively. In the validation subset, the concordance index of this nomogram reached to 0.64 to identify the individual metastasis pattern. Supporting by this nomogram algorithm, the individual metastasis risk might be refined personally and potentially guiding the treatment decisions and target therapy against the related signaling pathways for patients with locally advanced NPC.",2019,Cancer Control : Journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center
A prognostic nomogram for the prediction of neuroblastoma,"Abstract Background Neuroblastoma (NBL) is the most common and aggressive cancer in infants, and there are no robust predictive nomograms for NBL. In this study, a database from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments was applied to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram for the prediction of individual 5-year overall survival (OS) probability in patients with NBL. Methods A total of 729 eligible NBL patients with their clinicopathological factors and biological characteristics from the database were assigned to either the training cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰511) or the validation cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰218). Independent predictors were identiï¬ed by fitting the Cox model with lasso penalty and then were assembled into a nomogram to predict survival. The model was developed for predicting individual 5-year OS probability and was then internally and externally validated, calibrated and compared in each cohort. Results Four independent prognostic factors (International NBL Staging System stage, ploidy, histology and Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group risk group) were discriminated and achieved favourable prediction efï¬cacy following the lasso model. The prognostic nomogram incorporated those factors that performed well in the training and validation cohorts with OS (HRâ€‰=â€‰0.36, 95% CI: 0.27-0.48, Pâ€‰ Conclusions The robust prognostic nomogram with four independent prognostic factors can accurately and diversely predict OS and recurrence-free survival in NBL patients.

Convergence analysis of accelerated proximal extra-gradient method with applications,"Abstract Proximal algorithms are popular class of methods for handling sparsity structure in the datasets due to their low iteration costs and faster convergence. In this paper, we consider the framework of the sum of two convex functions, one of which is a smooth function with a Lipschitz gradient, while the other may be a non-smooth function. The usages of such non-smooth functions for identifying complex sparsity-structures in datasets in form of non-smooth regularizers has been an active research direction in the recent past. In this paper, we present the convergence analysis for the extragradient-based fixed-point method with an inertial component, based on which recently a new accelerated proximal extragradient algorithm is designed. In addition, extending the application areas of this algorithm, we applied it to solve (i) the logistic regression problem with complex l1-based penalties, namely, overlapping group lasso and fused lasso frameworks, and (ii) a recently proposed structurally-regularized learning problem for representation selection where the objective function consists of a reconstruction error and structured regularizers as combination of group sparsity regularizer, diversity regularizer, and locality-sensitivity regularizer. With the help of extensive experiments on several publicly available real-world datasets, the efficacy of the inertial-based extragradient methods has been demonstrated for solving the extended lasso and representation selection problems of machine learning.",2020,Neurocomputing
MicroRNA Expression-Based Model Indicates Event-Free Survival in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"Purpose Children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) whose disease is refractory to standard induction chemotherapy therapy or who experience relapse after initial response have dismal outcomes. We sought to comprehensively profile pediatric AML microRNA (miRNA) samples to identify dysregulated genes and assess the utility of miRNAs for improved outcome prediction. Patients and Methods To identify miRNA biomarkers that are associated with treatment failure, we performed a comprehensive sequence-based characterization of the pediatric AML miRNA landscape. miRNA sequencing was performed on 1,362 samples-1,303 primary, 22 refractory, and 37 relapse samples. One hundred sixty-four matched samples-127 primary and 37 relapse samples-were analyzed by using RNA sequencing. Results By using penalized lasso Cox proportional hazards regression, we identified 36 miRNAs the expression levels at diagnosis of which were highly associated with event-free survival. Combined expression of the 36 miRNAs was used to create a novel miRNA-based risk classification scheme (AMLmiR36). This new miRNA-based risk classifier identifies those patients who are at high risk (hazard ratio, 2.830; P â‰¤ .001) or low risk (hazard ratio, 0.323; P â‰¤ .001) of experiencing treatment failure, independent of conventional karyotype or mutation status. The performance of AMLmiR36 was independently assessed by using 878 patients from two different clinical trials (AAML0531 and AAML1031). Our analysis also revealed that miR-106a-363 was abundantly expressed in relapse and refractory samples, and several candidate targets of miR-106a-5p were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, a process that is suppressed in treatment-resistant leukemic cells. Conclusion To assess the utility of miRNAs for outcome prediction in patients with pediatric AML, we designed and validated a miRNA-based risk classification scheme. We also hypothesized that the abundant expression of miR-106a could increase treatment resistance via modulation of genes that are involved in oxidative phosphorylation.",2017,Journal of Clinical Oncology
Robust Lasso Regression Using Tukey's Biweight Criterion,"ABSTRACTThe adaptive lasso is a method for performing simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection. The adaptive weights used in its penalty term mean that the adaptive lasso achieves the oracle property. In this work, we propose an extension of the adaptive lasso named the Tukey-lasso. By using Tukey's biweight criterion, instead of squared loss, the Tukey-lasso is resistant to outliers in both the response and covariates. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Tukey-lasso also enjoys the oracle property. A fast accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm is proposed and implemented for computing the Tukey-lasso. Our extensive simulations show that the Tukey-lasso, implemented with the APG algorithm, achieves very reliable results, including for high-dimensional data where p > n. In the presence of outliers, the Tukey-lasso is shown to offer substantial improvements in performance compared to the adaptive lasso and other robust implementations of the lasso.

Analysis of Bed Use Performance of Pediatrics Clinics in Turkey,"Abstract Introduction: One of the most important sources of hospitals is patient beds. About 14% of the total patients in Turkey are allocated clinical pediatrics. Efficient and efficient use of the allocated beds significantly affects hospital performance. The study is aimed to analyze pediatric clinics bed use performance by using Pabon Lasso diagram in Turkey. Materials and Methods: Pabon Lasso Model was used to determine the bed use performance levels of pediatric clinics. In this model, hospital performance indicators are used as variables; bed occupancy rate (BOR), bed turnover rate (BTR) and average length of stay (ALS). Research data were obtained from the Statistical Report of Public Hospitals Unions. Data were analyzed using MS Excel, SPSS 22 software and Pabon Lasso graph. Results: According to the results obtained, bed performance indicators of pediatric clinics which BOR, BRT and ALS were found to be on average 46.2, 5.7 and 41.8, respectively. According to the model, pediatric surgery and urology and pediatric health and diseases clinics have the highest bed performance, while the most inefficient clinics are pediatric metabolic diseases, pediatric rheumatology and pediatric neurology. In the study, 38% of pediatric clinics are in the third most fertile region, while 44% of the first inefficient region is located. Conclusion: Hospitals are the most important element of a health system. Most of the resources allocated to the health sector are allocated to hospitals. Hence, we can say that hospitals are the most basic and most expensive component of health systems. The bed efficiency of hospitals has a significant impact on health system performance. The bed occupancy rate of the pediatric clinic was determined to be 46% in Turkey. This rate is lower than the average general hospital in Turkey. Therefore, in order for pediatric clinics to provide quality and cost-effective health care, bed performance should be evaluated regularly.

Adaptive k-class estimation in high-dimensional linear models,"AbstractIn this paper, we explore the k-class estimator in high-dimensional linear models with potential endogeneity issues which are very common in empirical economics studies. K-class estimator has the advantage of incorporating many popular estimators such as the OLS estimator, two stage least squares (2SLS) estimator, limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimator, etc., as k takes on different values. Our main innovations are: 1) In the newly proposed high-dimensional k-class estimator, we allow the value of k (hence the level of endogeneity) to be determined by the data. Therefore, our method is very useful in empirical studies where the researcher do not know the severity of endogeneity or the importance of variables in a very large pool of candidate covariates. 2) In this paper, the adaptive LASSO method is incorporated into the generalized k-class estimation for variable selection and coefficient estimation in both the structural and reduced form equations. We show that the adaptive LASS...",2019,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
ASFMR1 splice variant,"Objective To explore the association of a splice variant of the antisense fragile X mental retardation 1 (ASFMR1) gene, loss of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) AGG interspersions and FMR1 CGG repeat size with manifestation, and severity of clinical symptoms of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Methods Premutation carriers (PMCs) with FXTAS, without FXTAS, and normal controls (NCs) had a neurologic evaluation and collection of skin and blood samples. Expression of ASFMR1 transcript/splice variant 2 (ASFMR1-TV2), nonspliced ASFMR1, total ASFMR1, and FMR1 messenger RNA were quantified and compared using analysis of variance. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed. Results Premutation men and women both with and without FXTAS had higher ASFMR1-TV2 levels compared with NC men and women (n = 135,135, p < 0.0001), and ASFMR1-TV2 had good discriminating power for FXTAS compared with NCs but not for FXTAS from PMC. After adjusting for age, loss of AGG, larger CGG repeat size (in men), and elevated ASFMR1-TV2 level (in women) were strongly associated with FXTAS compared with NC and PMC (combined). Conclusions This study found elevated levels of ASFMR1-TV2 and loss of AGG interruptions in both men and women with FXTAS.

Adaptive Online Monitoring of Voltage Stability Margin via Local Regression,"An online voltage stability margin (VSM) monitoring approach based on local regression and adaptive database is proposed. Considering the increasing variability and uncertainty of power system operation, this approach utilizes the locality of underlying pattern between VSM and reactive power reserve (RPR), and can adapt to the changing condition of system. LASSO is tailored to solve the local regression problem so as to mitigate the curse of dimensionality for large scale system. Along with the VSM prediction, its confidence interval is also estimated simultaneously in a simple but effective way, and utilized as an evidence to trigger the database updating. IEEE 30-bus system and a 60,000-bus large system are used to test and demonstrate the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach can be successfully employed in online voltage stability monitoring for real size systems, and the adaptivity of model and data endows the proposed approach with the advantage in the circumstances where large and unforeseen changes of system condition are inevitable.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems
Discussion,"To these points we would add the following. A plethora of applicable model-selection techniques has been developed since Daniel first introduced the normal and half-normal plots of eâ†µects in the 1950s. Some popular alternatives include stepwise regression, lars-lasso, and the Dantzig selector. See, for example, DraguljÃ­c et al. (2014) for a recent assessment of these techniques for the analysis of interactions. Can these methods contribute eâ†µectively to the analysis of saturated experiments? Providing a general purpose (OK, cookbook) approach to model selection would make the analysis a bit less daunting for the nonstatistician. Given that weâ€™ve chosen to abandon the Daniel plot, what alternatives are suggested? Simple dot plots and/or Pareto plots of estimated eâ†µects oâ†µer advantages, but judgment as to statistical significance is still subjective. Lenthâ€™s (1989) method, with eâ†µects displayed in a Pareto plot with a superimposed reference line and simulated P -values (as in the JMP implementation) is a plausible alternative. But Lenthâ€™s method has limitations as well. The breakdown point occurs whenever more than half of the eâ†µects are active and the method relies on normality, eâ†µect-sparsity, and standard errors. Randomization analysis is an alternative that seems to get little attention, and which oâ†µers the potential for robustness to the level of sparsity and normality. Loughlin and Noble (1997) provided methodology for implementing a randomization analysis for unreplicated two-level factorial and fractional factorial designs.",2015,Journal of Quality Technology
Interconnectedness and systemic risk network of Chinese financial institutions: A LASSO-CoVaR approach,"Abstract The 2015â€“2016 Chinaâ€™s stock market crash raises awareness of risk contagion in financial system. How to investigate systemic risk from the perspective of network is still a challenging work especially for considering a large number of financial institutions. To this end, we introduce the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method into the CoVaR estimation to construct a systemic risk network between financial institutionsâ€™ tail risk exposures. First, we apply the LASSO-CoVaR based systemic risk network to investigate the interconnectedness and systemic risk of financial institutions in China from 2010 to 2017. Our empirical results show that the interconnectedness among institutions is very important and cannot be ignored in estimating CoVaR of an individual institution. Second, the topology analysis shows that the system-level interconnectedness reaches a peak when the system is under distress, especially before and after the stock market crash occurred. Third, we rank institutions in terms of the systemic risk contribution and find that their systemic importance changes in four different sub-periods. To sum up, our empirical results reveal substantial relevant risk spillover channels and identify the systemically important financial institutions in China, providing useful information for regulators to formulate macro prudential supervision policy.",2019,Physica A-statistical Mechanics and Its Applications
"Mathematical programming for the sum of two convex functions with applications to lasso problem, split feasibility problems, and image deblurring problem","In this paper, two iteration processes are used to find the solutions of the mathematical programming for the sum of two convex functions.

We also apply our result on the lasso problem to the image deblurring problem. Some numerical examples are given to demonstrate our results.

Weak Fault Detection of Tapered Rolling Bearing Based on Penalty Regularization Approach,"Aimed at the issue of estimating the fault component from a noisy observation, a novel detection approach based on augmented Huber non-convex penalty regularization (AHNPR) is proposed. The core objectives of the proposed method are that (1) it estimates non-zero singular values (i.e., fault component) accurately and (2) it maintains the convexity of the proposed objective cost function (OCF) by restricting the parameters of the non-convex regularization. Specifically, the AHNPR model is expressed as the L1-norm minus a generalized Huber function, which avoids the underestimation weakness of the L1-norm regularization. Furthermore, the convexity of the proposed OCF is proved via the non-diagonal characteristic of the matrix BTB, meanwhile, the non-zero singular values of the OCF is solved by the forwardâ€“backward splitting (FBS) algorithm. Last, the proposed method is validated by the simulated signal and vibration signals of tapered bearing. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can identify weak fault information from the raw vibration signal under severe background noise, that the non-convex penalty regularization can induce sparsity of the singular values more effectively than the typical convex penalty (e.g., L1-norm fused lasso optimization (LFLO) method), and that the issue of underestimating sparse coefficients can be improved.",2018,Algorithms
Variable-width confidence intervals in Gaussian regression and penalized maximum likelihood estimators,"Hard thresholding, LASSO , adaptive LASSO and SCAD point estimators have been suggested for use in the linear regression context when most of the components of the regression parameter vector are believed to be zero, a sparsity type of assumption. Potscher and Schneider, 2010, Electronic Journal of Statistics, have considered the properties of fixed-width confidence intervals that include one of these point estimators (for all possible data values). They consider a normal linear regression model with orthogonal regressors and show that these confidence intervals are longer than the standard confidence interval (based on the maximum likelihood estimator) when the tuning parameter for these point estimators is chosen to lead to either conservative or consistent model selection. We extend this analysis to the case of variable-width confidence intervals that include one of these point estimators (for all possible data values). In consonance with these findings of Potscher and Schneider, we find that these confidence intervals perform poorly by comparison with the standard confidence interval, when the tuning parameter for these point estimators is chosen to lead to consistent model selection. However, when the tuning parameter for these point estimators is chosen to lead to conservative model selection, our conclusions differ from those of Potscher and Schneider. We consider the variable-width confidence intervals of Farchione and Kabaila, 2008, Statistics & Probability Letters, which have advantages over the standard confidence interval in the context that there is a belief in a sparsity type of assumption.

Citing Amal Amirehâ€™s article on the fraught history of the reception of El Saadawi in Egypt and in Europe, Valassopoulos comments that Arab womenâ€™s literature tends to be seen as â€˜documentaryâ€™, and this obscures the â€˜core issue of representationâ€™ as it is explored and challenged by women writers. In the face of this omission, the present article explores a selection of works by El Saadawi and Djebar from an aesthetic perspective. El Saadawi and Djebar use literary writing as a means to escape the constraints placed upon them by patriarchy, as well as by colonialism, and uphold creativity and poetry as a possible release from imprisonment. This article also uses Glissantâ€™s and Bhabhaâ€™s concepts of literary opacity and the right to narrate as a partial framework for a reading of the relation between writing, freedom and...",2010,Feminist Theory

Selecting families and their applications,"Deguire and Lassonde [P. Deguire, M. Lassonde, Familles selectantes, Topol. Methods Nonlinear Anal. 5 (1995) 261-269] extend the concept of continuous selection and introduce the notion of selecting family for a family of set-valued mappings. In this paper, we first establish a new existence theorem of selecting families.

Supplement : Proofs and Technical Details for â€œ The Solution Path of the Generalized Lasso â€,"In this document we give supplementary details to the paper "" The Solution Path of the Generalized Lasso "". We use the prefix "" GL "" when referring to equations, sections, etc. in the original paper, as in equation (GL-1) or Section GL-1 (this stands for Generalized Lasso). 1 Proof of the boundary lemma We prove the boundary lemma when D = D 1d , but first we give a helpful lemma. Lemma 1. Let T Î» denote the function that truncates outside of the interval [âˆ’Î», Î»]: T Î» (x) = ï£± ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£³ âˆ’Î» if x < âˆ’Î» x if |x| â‰¤ Î» Î» if x > Î». Proof. Suppose without a loss of generality that Î» 0 > Î». We enumerate the possible cases: The remaining cases follow by symmetry. Proof of the boundary lemma. Our approach for the proof is a little unusual: we consider the use of coordinate descent to find the solutionÃ» Î» , starting at the pointÃ» Î»0 as an initial guess. Because the coordinate updates are especially simple, we can track how the iterates change, and hence we can guarantee thatÃ» Î» andÃ» Î»0 are close together. Namely, we show thatÃ» Î»0 âˆ’ Ë† u Î» âˆž â‰¤ Î» 0 âˆ’ Î», which implies the desired result. First we describe the coordinate descent updates for finding the solutionÃ» Î» of the dual (GL-13), when D = D 1d. We note that any limit point of the coordinate descent algorithm is indeed a solution by Theorem 4.1 of [1]. We take u (0) = Ë† u Î»0 as an initial guess, and cycle through the coordinates in 1",2013,
On Rock-stratigraphic Units,"Rock-stratigraphic units are of special importance for the study on regional stratigra-phy.These units are established mainly on the basis of sedimentary facies,lithologicalassociations,cycles of deposition and various kinds of discontinuity in the stratigraphicalsequence. With a stratigraphical as well as a tectonic point of view,stratigraphical discontinui-ties may be classified as follows: â–  Rock-stratigraphic units may be divided into four ranks,they are,in descending order,System-group,Group,Formation and Subformation.Formation is the foundamental unitand therefore of special importance. Formation:A formation is a set of strata of definite sedimentary facies or rock types,with definite and easily recognizable lower and upper boundaries,having a considerablethickness and a rather wide geographical distribution. The areal distribution of a formation under stable conditions often corresponds to theplatform or the shelf,while under the condition of obvious geotectonic differentiation itis often confined to a tectonic-facies zone. Sub-formation:A subformation is a subdivision of a formation and is based on muchthe same principle.The main difference is that a subformation has a lesser extent ofareal distribution.It may be used with advantage when a formation is very thick andis divisible only in a certain region,or when a formation contains easily separable trans-gressive or regressive part of limited distribution.Subformation should not be confusedwith member,which is an index bed or a tongue-shaped indentation within,but not asubdivision of a formation. Group:A group is a combination of successive formations and therefore comprises com-plicated sedimentary facies or rock types which,though formed under different conditionsand of different origin,are nevertheless themselves genetically related. Group is mainly classified according to its geotectonic environment,and therefore isclosely connected with the conception of lithological association. System-group:A system-group represents the highest rank in the category of rock-stra-tigraphic units.It usually corresponds to a sequence of lithological associations formedin a whole geotectonic cycle.It often corresponds to a structure layer. The areal distribution of the system-group is often equal to,but is not necessarilyconfined to a platform and a geocynclinal system.The contact relation between successivesystem-groups is invariably regional unconformity of long time duration.",1966,Acta Geological Sinica
Using Double-Lasso Regression for Principled Variable Selection,"The decision of whether to control for covariates, and how to select which covariates to include, is ubiquitous in psychological research. Failing to control for valid covariates can yield biased parameter estimates in correlational analyses or in imperfectly randomized experiments and contributes to underpowered analyses even in effectively randomized experiments. We introduce double-lasso regression as a principle method for variable selection. The double lasso method is calibrated to not over-select potentially spurious covariates, and simulations demonstrate that using this method reduces error and increases statistical power. This method can be used to identify which covariates have sufficient empirical support for inclusion in analyses of correlations, moderation, mediation and experimental interventions, as well as to test for the effectiveness of randomization. We illustrate both the methodâ€™s usefulness and how to implement it in practice by applying it to four analyses from the prior literature, using both correlational and experimental data.",2016,
High-performance pen + touch modality interactions: a real-time strategy game eSports context,"We used the situated context of real-time strategy (RTS) games to address the design and evaluation of new pen + touch interaction techniques. RTS play is a popular genre of Electronic Sports (eSports), games played and spectated at an extremely high level. Interaction techniques are critical for eSports players, because they so directly impact performance.
 Through this process, new techniques and implications for pen + touch and bi-manual interaction emerged. We enhance non-dominant hand (NDH) interaction with edge-constrained affordances, anchored to physical features of interactive sur- faces, effectively increasing target width. We develop bi-manual overloading, an approach to reduce the total number of occurrences of NDH retargeting. The novel isosceles lasso select technique facilitates selection of complex object subsets. Pen-in-hand interaction, dominant hand touch interaction performed with the pen stowed in the palm, also emerged as an efficient and expressive interaction paradigm.",2012,

Variability in water temperature affects trait-mediated survival of a newly settled coral reef fish,"As animals with complex life cycles metamorphose from one stage to the next, carry-over effects from earlier stages can affect future mortality. To examine the relationship between early life history traits and survival, seven monthly cohorts of newly-settled bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum were collected immediately after settlement and over sequential 3-day periods. Otolith analysis was used to quantify mean larval and juvenile growth rates, pelagic larval duration (PLD), and settlement size and condition of different age classes to identify the traits most important for survival. Overall, survivors tended to have shorter PLDs, to settle at smaller sizes and higher condition levels, and to exhibit faster early juvenile growth. Water temperature contributed to among-cohort variability in traits as warmer water led to faster larval and juvenile growth and shorter PLDs. Trait-specific fitness functions demonstrated that temperature can influence fitness by changing the nature of selection on each trait. Estimates of selection intensity revealed that settlement condition contributed the most to variation in fitness across cohorts, followed by juvenile growth. Frequent loss of low settlement condition individuals and occasional loss of the very highest condition fish suggest that particularly high settlement condition during the warmest temperatures may be detrimental. Not only does the quality of settlers vary over time, but selective loss of individuals with particular phenotypic traits is not pervasive and can vary with environmental conditions such as temperature.",2010,Oecologia
The Decomposition of Philosophy: Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s Speculative Messianism in The Number and the Siren,"A critical review essay on Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s The Number and the Siren: A Decipherment of MallarmÃ©â€™s â€œCoup de dÃ©sâ€ (2012). The first part examines in detail the claims and methods of the book, particularly the skeleton key approach based on word count. It then questions why Meillassoux follows so closely and surreptitiously three key texts of Edgar Allan Poeâ€™s about chance and necessity, which leads to expanding the essayâ€™s critical horizon to his philosophical enterprise as a whole. Taking up his central notion of â€œabsolute contingencyâ€ and its correlative dismissal of continental philosophy, the essay interprets Meillassouxâ€™s project as a radical and messianic re-envisioning of chance, necessity and address in literature and philosophy. In spite of its unimpressive scholarship on poetry and MallarmÃ©, and an overall weak indictment of continental philosophy, The Number and the Siren must be read for what it is: an attempt at performing the parousia of speculative temporality.",2014,Diacritics
Model Selection Consistency of Lasso for Empirical Data,"Large-scale empirical data, the sample size and the dimension are high, often exhibit various characteristics. For example, the noise term follows unknown distributions or the model is very sparse that the number of critical variables is fixed while dimensionality grows with n.

The authors investigate both theoretical guarantees and simulations, and show that the lasso is robust for various kinds of data.",2015,"Chinese Annals of Mathematics, Series B"
A Dual Certificates Analysis of Compressive Off-the-Grid Recovery,"Many problems in machine learning and imaging can be framed as an infinite dimensional Lasso problem to estimate a sparse measure. This includes for instance regression using a continuously parameterized dictionary, mixture model estimation and super-resolution of images. To make the problem tractable, one typically sketches the observations (often called compressive-sensing in imaging) using randomized projections. In this work, we provide a comprehensive treatment of the recovery performances of this class of approaches, proving that (up to log factors) a number of sketches proportional to the sparsity is enough to identify the sought after measure with robustness to noise. We prove both exact support stability (the number of recovered atoms matches that of the measure of interest) and approximate stability (localization of the atoms) by extending two classical proof techniques (minimal norm dual certificate and golfing scheme certificate).",2018,ArXiv
Variable Selection with Prior Information for Generalized Linear Models via the Prior LASSO Method.,"LASSO is a popular statistical tool often used in conjunction with generalized linear models that can simultaneously select variables and estimate parameters. When there are many variables of interest, as in current biological and biomedical studies, the power of LASSO can be limited. Fortunately, so much biological and biomedical data have been collected and they may contain useful information about the importance of certain variables. This paper proposes an extension of LASSO, namely, prior LASSO (pLASSO), to incorporate that prior information into penalized generalized linear models. The goal is achieved by adding in the LASSO criterion function an additional measure of the discrepancy between the prior information and the model. For linear regression, the whole solution path of the pLASSO estimator can be found with a procedure similar to the Least Angle Regression (LARS). Asymptotic theories and simulation results show that pLASSO provides significant improvement over LASSO when the prior information is relatively accurate. When the prior information is less reliable, pLASSO shows great robustness to the misspecification. We illustrate the application of pLASSO using a real data set from a genome-wide association study.",2016,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Statistical Modelling of Temperature Risk,"Recently the topic of global warming has become very popular. The literature has concentrated its attention on the evidence of such eect, either by detecting regime shifts or change points in time series. The majority of these methods are designed to nd shifts in mean, but only few can do this for the variance. In this paper we attempt to investigate the statistical evidence of global warming by identi- fying shifts in seasonal mean of daily average temperatures over time and in seasonal variance of temperature residuals. We present a time series approach for modelling temperature dynamics. A seasonal mean Lasso-type technique based with a multi- plicative structure of Fourier and GARCH terms in volatility is proposed. The model describes well the stylised facts of temperature: seasonality, intertemporal correla- tions and the heteroscedastic behaviour of residuals. The application to European temperature data indicates that the multiplicative model for the seasonal variance performs better in terms of out of sample forecast than other models proposed in the literature for modelling temperature dynamics. We study the dynamics of the seasonal variance by implementing quantile and expectile functions with condence corridor to detrended and deseasonalized residuals. We show that shifts in seasonal mean and variance vary from location to location, indicating that all sources of trends other than mean and variance would rise trends over spatial scales. The local eects of temperature risk support the existence of global warming.",2012,
Subgroup identification in clinical trials: an overview of available methods and their implementations with R.,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) usually enroll heterogeneous study population, and thus it is interesting to identify subgroups of patients for whom the treatment may be beneficial or harmful. A variety of methods have been developed to do such kind of post hoc analyses. Conventional generalized linear model is able to include prognostic variables as a main effect and predictive variables in an interaction with treatment variable. A statistically significant and large interaction effect usually indicates potential subgroups that may have different responses to the treatment. However, the conventional regression method requires to specify the interaction term, which requires knowledge of predictive variables or becomes infeasible when there is a large number of feature variables. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method does variable selection by shrinking less clear effects (including interaction effects) to zero and in this way selects only certain variables and interactions for the model. There are many tree-based methods for subgroup identification. For example, model-based recursive partitioning incorporates parametric models such as generalized linear models into trees. The model incorporated is usually a simple model with only the treatment as covariate. Predictive and prognostic variables are found and incorporated automatically via the tree. The present article gives an overview of these methods and explains how to perform them using the free software environment for statistical computing R (version 3.3.2). A simulated dataset is employed for illustrating the performance of these methods.",2018,Annals of translational medicine
Sparse Additive Ordinary Differential Equations for Dynamic Gene Regulatory Network Modeling.,"The gene regulation network (GRN) is a high-dimensional complex system, which can be represented by various mathematical or statistical models. The ordinary differential equation (ODE) model is one of the popular dynamic GRN models. High-dimensional linear ODE models have been proposed to identify GRNs, but with a limitation of the linear regulation effect assumption. In this article, we propose a sparse additive ODE (SA-ODE) model, coupled with ODE estimation methods and adaptive group LASSO techniques, to model dynamic GRNs that could flexibly deal with nonlinear regulation effects. The asymptotic properties of the proposed method are established and simulation studies are performed to validate the proposed approach. An application example for identifying the nonlinear dynamic GRN of T-cell activation is used to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method.",2014,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Parameter expansion in local-shrinkage models,"This paper considers the problem of using MCMC to fit sparse Bayesian models based on normal scale-mixture priors. Examples of this framework include the Bayesian LASSO and the horseshoe prior. We study the usefulness of parameter expansion (PX) for improving convergence in such models, which is notoriously slow when the global variance component is near zero. Our conclusion is that parameter expansion does improve matters in LASSO-type models, but only modestly. In most cases this improvement, while noticeable, is less than what might be expected, especially compared to the improvements that PX makes possible for models very similar to those considered here. We give some examples, and we attempt to provide some intuition as to why this is so. We also describe how slice sampling may be used to update the global variance component. In practice, this approach seems to perform almost as well as parameter expansion. As a practical matter, however, it is perhaps best viewed not as a replacement for PX, but as a tool for expanding the class of models to which PX is applicable.",2010,arXiv: Computation

A Highly Efficient Semismooth Newton Augmented Lagrangian Method for Solving Lasso Problems,"We develop a fast and robust algorithm for solving large-scale convex composite optimization models with an emphasis on the $\ell_1$-regularized least squares regression (lasso) problems. Despite the fact that there exist a large number of solvers in the literature for the lasso problems, we found that no solver can efficiently handle difficult large-scale regression problems with real data. By leveraging on available error bound results to realize the asymptotic superlinear convergence property of the augmented Lagrangian algorithm, and by exploiting the second order sparsity of the problem through the semismooth Newton method, we are able to propose an algorithm, called Ssnal, to efficiently solve the aforementioned difficult problems. Under very mild conditions, which hold automatically for lasso problems, both the primal and the dual iteration sequences generated by Ssnal possess a fast linear convergence rate, which can even be superlinear asymptotically.

Longitudinal changes in brain structures related to appetitive reactivity and regulation across development,"In the United States over one-third of the population, including children and adolescents, are overweight or obese. Despite the prevalence of obesity, few studies have examined how food cravings and the ability to regulate them change throughout development. Here, we addressed this gap in knowledge by examining structural brain and behavioral changes associated with regulation of craving across development. In a longitudinal design, individuals ages 6-26 completed two structural scans as well as a behavioral task where they used a cognitive regulatory strategy to decrease the appetitive value of foods. Behaviorally, we found that the ability to regulate craving improved with age. Neurally, improvements in regulatory ability were associated with cortical thinning in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex. We also found that models with cortical thickness measurements and age chosen by a lasso-based variable selection method could predict an individual's regulation behavior better than age and other behavioral factors alone. Additionally, when controlling for age, smaller ventral striatal volumes were associated with higher body mass index and predicted greater increases in weight two years later. Taken together, these results demonstrate a role for structural brain changes in supporting the ability to resist cravings for appetitive foods across development.",2019,Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience
A System-Wide Approach to Measure Connectivity in the Financial Sector,"We develop and estimate a measure of network connectivity for a sample of very large financial institutions of the U.S. Our model takes a system-wide approach that explicitly recognizes the possibility of connectivity of all the firms in the network. This is in sharp contrast with extant measures of systemic risk that, either explicitly or implicitly, estimate such connections using pair-wise relationships between institutions. We show that such a pair-wise approach may not be able to identify the correct topology of the network, which in turn can result in improper classification of banks as systemically important institutions. Our system-wide approach, based on a recently developed Lasso penalized Vector Auto-Regression (LVAR) model, allows us to detect important systemic events and identify systemically important institutions in a statistically principled manner.",2017,
A network-based variable selection approach for identification of modules and biomarker genes associated with end-stage kidney disease.,"AIMS
Intervention for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), which is associated with adverse prognoses and major economic burdens, is challenging due to its complex pathogenesis. The study was performed to identify biomarker genes and molecular mechanisms for ESKD by bioinformatics approach.


METHODS
Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE37171, this study identified pathways and genomic biomarkers associated with ESKD via a multi-stage knowledge discovery process, including identification of modules of genes by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), discovery of important involved pathways by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, selection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by the empirical Bayes method, and screening biomarker genes by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) logistic regression. The results were validated using GSE70528, an independent testing dataset.


RESULTS
Three clinically important gene modules associated with ESKD, were identified by WGCNA. Within these modules, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed important biological pathways involved in ESKD, including TGF-Î² and Wnt signaling, RNA-splicing, autophagy, and chromatin and histone modification. Furthermore, Lasso logistic regression was conducted to identify five final genes, namely, CNOT8, MST4, PPP2CB, PCSK7 and RBBP4, that are differentially expressed and associated with ESKD. The accuracy of the final model in distinguishing the ESKD cases and controls was 96.8% and 91.7% in the training and validation datasets, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
Network-based variable selection approaches can identify biological pathways and biomarker genes associated with ESKD. The findings may inform more in-depth follow-up research and effective therapy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",2019,Nephrology
Singing Jeremiah: Music and Meaning in Holy Week by Robert L. Kendrick (review),"LITURGICAL MUSIC Singing Jeremiah: Music and Meaning in Holy Week. By Robert L. Kendrick. (Music and the Early Modern Imagination.) Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2014. [x, 337 p. ISBN 9780253011565 (hardcover), $50; ISBN 9780253011626 (e-book), $42.99.] Appendix, notes, bibliography, index.In early modern Catholicism, the three days before Easter-collectively known as the Triduum-comprised a solemn marathon of rituals that awakened the senses, mind, and soul. Robert Kendrick opens Singing Jeremiah by describing the Triduum as ""the longest single commemoration, collective and personal, of the central events of salvation"" (p. 1). Kendrick's book, however, is not a general overview of Holy Week rituals, but rather a study that isolates a genre of Triduum music from roughly 1550-1750: the Canonical Hours of Matins and Lauds, which were performed as a combined service for the days of Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday. These combined Hours were known as Tenebrae, meaning darkness or shadows. The name comes from the central role that light (or lack thereof ) played during the services; these Hours were typically performed in the late afternoon on the eve of their prescribed liturgical day when natural daylight was fading. Moreover, a defining feature of these Hours was the gradual extinguishing of candles as each psalm was sung. The title of this book refers to the Lamentations of Jeremiah, which played a prominent role during Tenebrae as Lessons alongside psalms and other prescribed liturgical texts.Singing Jeremiah provides a panoptic tour of early modern Tenebrae services in the regions that practiced the combined Hours, namely continental Europe and its outposts. Kendrick gives considerable attention to Italy, the Iberian Peninsula, and certain areas of the Austro-Germanic lands, but his survey of Tenebrae also includes repertories from places such as Prague, Paris, and the New World. The scope of composers represented in this study is remarkable: Emilio de' Cavalieri, Thomas Crecquillon, Leonardo Leo, and Nicolo Jommelli are only a few examples. The treatment of Marc-Antoine Charpentier's Tenebrae music in chapter 6 (""European Tenebrae c. 1680"") is particularly superb, and the poster boys of high Renaissance polyphony-Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Tomas Luis de Victoria, and Orlando di Lasso-also make appearances in earlier chapters.Kendrick's survey of music and primary accounts associated with Tenebrae from this astonishing array of regions and repertories is not without a directed goal. His intent is to view the music, texts, and ritual of Tenebrae through lenses of social meaning and personal experience. He contends that a thorough understanding of Tenebrae encompasses not only written documents such as music scores and liturgical books, but the actual execution of the music, the gestures and movements associated with the ritual, and last but not least, the behavior of the participants (p. 2). The result is a skillfully crafted monograph in which the author weaves together strands of music analysis, exegesis, and social and political histories in order to convey the early modern concept of Tenebrae to our twenty-firstcentury imaginations.The first two chapters provide an overview of the ritual and describe how early modern Catholics would have understood the Tenebrae texts, which varied from place to place until the introduction of Roman liturgical books around the turn of the seventeenth century. Medieval allegorical interpretations played a role in textual meaning, but, as Kendrick points out, so did aspects of daily life such as the basic human need for food: the Triduum occurred during a period of intense fasting and equally intense liturgical activity, but also during a time of the year-early spring-when food was generally scarce. The verses in Lamentations that address famine and Jerusalem's yearning for bread had a ""literal parallel in the bodies of the [Tenebrae] participants (p. â€¦",2016,Notes
Machine learning analysis of tunnel magnetoresistance of magnetic tunnel junctions with disordered MgAl2O4,"Through Bayesian optimization and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique combined with first-principles calculations, we investigated the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect of Fe/disordered-MgAl2O4(MAO)/Fe(001) magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) to determine structures of disordered-MAO that give large TMR ratios. The optimal structure with the largest TMR ratio was obtained by Bayesian optimization with 1728 structural candidates, where the convergence was reached within 300 structure calculations. Characterization of the obtained structures suggested that the in-plane distance between two Al atoms plays an important role in determining the TMR ratio. Since the Al-Al distance of disordered MAO significantly affects the imaginary part of complex band structures, the majority-spin conductance of the {\Delta}1 state in Fe/disordered-MAO/Fe MTJs increases with increasing in-plane Al-Al distance, leading to larger TMR ratios. Furthermore, we found that the TMR ratio tended to be large when the ratio of the number of Al, Mg, and vacancies in the [001] plane was 2:1:1, indicating that the control of Al atomic positions is essential to enhancing the TMR ratio in MTJs with disordered MAO. The present work reveals the effectiveness and advantage of material informatics combined with first-principles transport calculations in designing high-performance spintronic devices based on MTJs.",2020,arXiv: Materials Science
The Feasibility of Reducing the Variance of Fish Relative Abundance Estimates by Integrating CPUE Data from Two Demersal Trawl Surveys in the Gulf of Alaska,"Catch per unit effort data of walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, and flathead sole Hippoglossoides elassodon from the National Marine Fisheries Service and Alaska Department of Fish and Game 1999 and 2001 Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl surveys were integrated to evaluate the feasibility of reducing the variance of the National Marine Fisheries Service biomass estimates for these species. Because of differences in the spatial design and areas covered by the 2 surveys, 2 new strata, recognizing bays as a separate stratification element and made up of portions of some of the original National Marine Fisheries Service strata, were introduced. Variance estimates based on the combined surveys were similar (<10% difference) to those based exclusively on the National Marine Fisheries Service survey data for all species and both years except for walleye pollock in 2001 (84% higher for the integrated surveys). Biomass estimates were also similar (<10% difference) between the integrated and nonintegrated data for all species and both years except for walleye pollock in both 1999 and 2001 (22% and 82% higher estimates for the integrated surveys in 1999 and 2001, respectively). A potential reason for the unexpected increase in the biomass and variance estimates for walleye pollock is a significant timedependence of the fishing power correction factor due to vertical migration of these fish. The appropriateness of integrating the data from these surveys is discussed.",2003,
"Randomized comparison of amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, artemether-lumefantrine, and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Burkina Faso.","BACKGROUND
Combination antimalarial therapy is advocated to improve treatment efficacy and limit selection of drug-resistant parasites. We compared the efficacies of 3 combination regimens in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso: amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, which was recently shown to be highly efficacious at this site; artemether-lumefantrine, the new national first-line antimalarial regimen; and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), a newer regimen.


METHODS
We enrolled 559 patients >or=6 months of age with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and randomized them to the 3 regimens. We analyzed the risk of recurrent parasitemia by day 28 and day 42, both unadjusted and adjusted by PCR methods to distinguish recrudescence and new infection.


RESULTS
Complete data were available for 517 (92.5%) of the enrolled subjects. Early treatment failures occurred in 5 patients treated with amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and in 2 patients each treated with the other regimens. The day 28 risk of recurrent parasitemia, unadjusted by genotyping, was significantly higher for patients receiving artemether-lumefantrine than for patients receiving amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (20.1% vs. 6.2%; risk difference, 13.8%; 95% confidence interval, 7.0%-20.7%) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (20.1% vs. 2.2%; risk difference, 17.9%; 95% confidence interval, 11.6%-24.1%). Similar differences were seen for children <5 years of age (54% of the study population) and when outcomes were extended to 42 days. Significant differences were not seen between outcomes for patients receiving amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and outcomes for those receiving dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Recrudescences were uncommon (occurring in <5% of patients) in all treatment groups. No serious adverse events were noted.


CONCLUSIONS
All regimens were highly efficacious in clearing infection, but considering the risks of recurrent malaria after therapy, the amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine regimens were more efficacious than the artemether-lumefantrine regimen (the new national regimen in Burkina Faso) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.",2007,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America
Pressure Ulcer Risk Factors in Persons with Mobility-Related Disabilities,"ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To assess pressure ulcer (PU) risk in persons with mobility impairments using a large data set to identify demographic, laboratory, hemodynamic, and pharmacologic risk factors. METHODS The cohort of interest was persons with disabilities who have mobility impairments and are diagnostically at risk of PUs. To define this cohort, diagnoses that qualify patients for skin protection wheelchair cushions were used. Data were obtained from the Cerner Health Facts data warehouse. Two cohorts were defined: persons with and without a history of PUs. Analysis included descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression modeling. Variables retained in the model were identified using LASSO, gradient boosting, and Bayesian model averaging. MAIN RESULTS The resulting cohorts included more than 87,000 persons with a history of PUs and more than 1.1 million persons who did not have a PU. The data revealed seven disability groups with the greatest prevalence of PUs: those with Alzheimer disease, cerebral palsy, hemiplegia, multiple sclerosis, paraplegia/quadriplegia, Parkinson disease, and spina bifida. Ulcers in the pelvic region accounted for 82% of PUs. Persons with disabilities who were male or black had a greater prevalence of PUs. Physiologic risk factors included the presence of kidney or renal disease, decreased serum albumin, and increased serum C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that, although persons with disabilities can exhibit a wide functional range, they remain at risk of PUs and should be evaluated for proper preventive measures, including support surfaces and wheelchair cushions.",2020,Advances in Skin & Wound Care
Rotten Banks: Predicting Bank Failures After Great Recession through Binary Classification,"Author(s): Ananyev, Maxim | Advisor(s): Hazlett, Chad J | Abstract: I investigate the determinants of bank failures after the financial crisis of the years 2007 - 2009 to build a predictive model of bank failures. I use two paradigms for prediction: accuracy-maximization and Neyman-Pearson paradigm. Accuracy-maximization implies that Type I errors and Type II errors are equally costly, thus out-of-sample predictive accuracy is the most important parameter for evaluation. Neyman-Pearson paradigm implies setting an upper bound for Type I errors and minimizing Type II errors within that bound. In this case, the costs associated with Type I and Type II errors can be different. I find that, because the bank failures are rare events, many of the accuracy-maximizing classifiers tend to assign all the observations to the class of non-failing banks. This achieves out-of-sample predictive accuracy of 96 percent but misses all the failures. Two algorithms, post-Lasso logit, and random forest tend to have a relatively low level of Type II errors. The classification with the Neyman-Pearson paradigm performs better in terms of minimizing Type II errors while containing Type I errors. All of the algorithms, in out-of-sample testing, were able to identify at least 50 percent of the failing banks, while having a false positive rate below ten percent. The minimum share of Type II errors was displayed by Ada-Boost algorithm (24 percent), while GLM with LASSO penalty and sparse LDA did not perform much worse (the level of Type II errors were 27 percent). My analysis produces additional substantive insights. I find that low profitability and a high proportion of impaired loans are the most important factors for bank failures.",2018,
Strategies and Software for Machine Learning Accelerated Discovery in Transition Metal Chemistry,"Machine learning the electronic structure of open shell transition metal complexes presents unique challenges, including robust and automated data set generation. Here, we introduce tools that simplify data acquisition from density functional theory (DFT) and validation of trained machine learning models using the molSimplify automatic design (mAD) workflow. We demonstrate this workflow by training and comparing the performance of LASSO, kernel ridge regression (KRR), and artificial neural network (ANN) models using heuristic, topological revised autocorrelation (RAC) descriptors we have recently introduced for machine learning inorganic chemistry. On a series of open shell transition metal complexes, we evaluate set aside test errors of these models for predicting the HOMO level and HOMOâ€“LUMO gap. The best performing models are ANNs, which show 0.15 and 0.25 eV test set mean absolute errors on the HOMO level and HOMOâ€“LUMO gap, respectively.

Les sites de Labine et Welasso : Ã©tude ethnoarchÃ©ologique de la rÃ©gion de Kong (Nord-Est de la CÃ´te-d'Ivoire),"The labine site is located in the suburb of kong. The archeological remains which were collected give a very detailed description of the daily life of a community at the end of the xviiith and xixth century - in particular concerning the study of ceramics. Two main categories of ceramics can be distinguished : undoubtedly some ceramics have been produced locally or regionally while the others are rare imports of decorative techniques. In welasso, suburb of teneguera, the remains collected which accompanied the ceramics are quite homogeneous overall and provide some remarkable information on at least on two subjects : the occupancy and the desertion of the site. The site showed a non-stop occupancy ; it also revealed chronological features which would imply a continuity in the use of manufacturing techniques of domestic ceramics. Some ceramic fragments which were part of high quality thrown pots, would imply that some contacts existed with the sudan. A study of the chronological data proved that the sites were occupied before the arrival of the mandes (xivth century)",1997,
Uncovering Dynamic Functional Connectivity of Parkinson's Disease Using Topological Features and Sparse Group Lasso,"Neuro-degenerative diseases such as Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) are clinically found to cause alternations and failures in brain connectivity. In this work, a new classification framework using dynamic functional connectivity and topological features is proposed, and it is shown that such framework can give better insights over discriminative difference of the disease itself. After utilizing sparse group lasso with anatomically labeled resting-state fMRI signal, both discriminating brain regions and voxels within can be identified easily. To give an overview of the effectiveness of such framework, the classification performance with the network features extracted on dynamic functional network is quantitatively evaluated. Experimental results show that either single feature of clustering coefficient or combined feature group of characteristic path length, diameter, eccentricity and radius perform well in classifying PD, and as a result the identified feature can lead to better interpretation for clinical purposes.",2018,

LASSO Method for Additive Risk Models with High Dimensional Covariates,"1 Summary. The additive risk model is a useful alternative to the proportional hazards model. It postulates that the hazard function is the sum of the baseline hazard function and the regression function of covariates. In this article, we investigate estimation in the additive risk model with right censored survival data and high dimensional covariates. A LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) approach is proposed for estimating the regression parameters. We propose using the L 1 boosting algorithm, which is computationally affordable and relatively easy to implement, to compute the LASSO estimates. The V-fold cross validation is applied to select the tuning parameter and the weighted bootstrap is used to estimate the variances of the LASSO estimators. The proposed approach is illustrated with analysis of the PBC clinical data and the DLBCL genomic data. It is shown that this approach can provide interpretable and sparse predictive models with satisfactory predication and classification properties.",2005,
Sparse Learning and Hybrid Probabilistic Oversampling for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis,"Alzheimers Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder associated with aging. Early diagnosis of AD is key to the development, assessment, and monitoring of new treatments for AD. Machine learning approaches are increasingly being applied on the diagnosis of AD from structural MRI. However, the high feature-dimension and imbalanced data learning problem is two major challenges in the study of computer aided AD diagnosis. To circumvent this problem, we propose a novel formulation with hinge loss and sparse group lasso to select the discriminative features since features exhibit certain intrinsic group structures, then we propose a hybrid probabilistic oversampling to alleviate the class imbalanced distribution. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare this method against the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods, and the results illustrated that this proposed method is more effective for diagnosis of AD compared to commonly used techniques.",2016,
Nonparametric Dissection of the Cross Section of Expected Stock Returnsâˆ—,"We propose a nonparametric method to test which characteristics provide independent information for the cross section of expected returns. We use the adaptive group LASSO to select characteristics and to estimate how they affect expected returns nonparametrically. Our method can handle a large number of characteristics, allows for a flexible functional form, and is insensitive to outliers. Many of the previously identified return predictors do not provide incremental information for expected returns, and nonlinearities are important. Our proposed method has higher out-of-sample explanatory power compared to linear panel regressions, and increases Sharpe ratios by 50%.",2017,
"A sporopollen assemblage from the early cretaceous fuxin formation in the kailu basin, Nei Mongol","The Kailu Basin lies in the southeast part of Nei Mongol(Inner Mongolia). The Lujiapu Depression is one of its basic structure units. Results of oil drilling project show that the Cretaceous sediments are widespread in the subsurface of the depression.Abundant sporo-pollen taxa have been found from the Early Cretaceous Fuxin Formation.They are grouped into the Cicatricosisporites-Pilosisporites-Tricolpopollenites assemblage.It is characterized by: 1.Gymnospermous pollen amount to about 68.3%,most of them are Disaccate pollen, such as Pinuspollenites, Piceaepollenites, Cedripites, Podocarpidites, Protoconiferus, Pseudopicea, etc. Taxodiaceaepollenites,Cerebropollenites,Perinopollenites,Psophosphera and Inaperturopollenites are next in contents. A certain amount of pollen grains of Cycadopites,Jiaohepollis,Monosulcites and Classopollis are also found in the assemblage. 2.Pteridophytic spores amount to about 29.7%.Spores related to Lygodiaceae are dominant which are composed mainly of Cicatricosisporites(7.8),Pilosispo-rites(1.2), Appendicisporites,Lygodiumsporites,Klukisporites,Impardecispora and Maculatisporites.

Variable Selection and Parameter Estimation with the Atan Regularization Method,"Variable selection is fundamental to high-dimensional statistical modeling. Many variable selection techniques may be implemented by penalized least squares using various penalty functions. In this paper, an arctangent type penalty which very closely resembles l 0 penalty is proposed; we call it Atan penalty.The Atan-penalized least squares procedure is shown to consistently select the correct model and is asymptotically normal, provided the number of variables grows slower than the number of observations. TheAtan procedure is efficiently implemented using an iteratively reweighted Lasso algorithm. Simulation results and data example show that the Atan procedure with BIC-type criterion performs very well in a variety of settings.",2016,
Feature selection method using WF-LASSO for gene expression data analysis,"There has been a lot of research that demonstrates the phenomenon of life or the origin of the disease, and classifies or diagnoses the state of the cell. These are usually achieved by the strength of the gene expression under certain circumstances using microarrays, which can observe tens and thousands of gene expression profiles. It is not feasible to use all the attributes because of the huge amount of gene expression data that are involved in microarray experiments. It is not feasible to use all the attributes because a lots of gene expression data are involved in microarray experiments. That is, because microarray data have a small number of samples compared to the number of the attributes, in the analyzing of the data there will be overfitting which requires a high cost due to the high dimensionality of the data. We propose a feature selection method using a technique which combines filter method with wavelet transform, and LASSO regression method based on a statistical regression analysis. We obtain the best classification results by applying, in order, the DWT, the filter method, and then finally LASSO. That is, the feature selection method with the best classification performance was WF-LASSO method. The contribution of this paper is in that it is possible to solve problems by reducing the dimensionality of a high volume of data by using the proposed method, so that the performance of the classification can be improved and a more stable classification model can be constructed.",2011,
Generalized Sparse Learning of Linear Models Over the Complete Subgraph Feature Set,"Supervised learning over graphs is an intrinsically difficult problem: simultaneous learning of relevant features from the complete subgraph feature set, in which enumerating all subgraph features occurring in given graphs is practically intractable due to combinatorial explosion. We show that 1) existing graph supervised learning studies, such as Adaboost, LPBoost, and LARS/LASSO, can be viewed as variations of a branch-and-bound algorithm with simple bounds, which we call Morishita-Kudo bounds; 2) We present a direct sparse optimization algorithm for generalized problems with arbitrary twice-differentiable loss functions, to which Morishita-Kudo bounds cannot be directly applied; 3) We experimentally showed that i) our direct optimization method improves the convergence rate and stability, and ii) L1-penalized logistic regression (L1-LogReg) by our method identifies a smaller subgraph set, keeping the competitive performance, iii) the learned subgraphs by L1-LogReg are more size-balanced than competing methods, which are biased to small-sized subgraphs.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
"The geochemistry and distribution of Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic wares of the territory of ancient Sagalassos (SW Turkey): A reconnaissance study","A reconnaissance survey carried out within the territory of Sagalassos yielded vast amounts of unknown ceramic wares, tentatively dated to the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods. An archaeometric programme including geochemical analysis and applied multivariate statistics was applied in order to grasp the diversity of the wares and consequently identify variability in production. Within the chemical spectrum, it becomes clear that at least two large production groups exist, with a substantial â€˜internalâ€™ distribution of wares. Elemental evidence supports the hypothesis of a local production of ceramics related to the geographical situation of the sites.",2011,
Using Real-time PCR to assess changes in the crude oil degrading microbial community in contaminated seawater mesocosms,Abstract The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to follow changes in the proportion of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria in the marine microbial community in oil polluted mesocosms during bioremediation field trial. Assay for alk-B1 of Alcanivorax borkumensis and alk-BT of Thalassolituus oleivorans were validated and found to be both sensitive and reproducible. Quantification of alk-B1 from A.Â borkumensis SK2 in mesocosms show that in single bioaugmentation mesocosm (M1) this gene has high quantity in fifth day of sampling but in biostimulating mesocosm (M2) and consortium bioaugmentation mesocosm (M3) the high quantity of this gene was in tenth day of sampling. The comparison between expression of alk-BT and alk-B1 in M3 mesocosm show that alk-B1 copy number was more than alk-BT. The proportion of alk-B1 or alk-BT containing bacteria was positively correlated to the concentration of crude oil in the mesocosms. After the concentration of crude oil in the mesocosms decreased the gene copy number of alkane monooxygenase genes also decreased.,2014,International Biodeterioration & Biodegradation
The horseshoe estimator: Posterior concentration around nearly black vectors,"We consider the horseshoe estimator due to Carvalho, Polson and Scott (2010) for the multivariate normal mean model in the situation that the mean vector is sparse in the nearly black sense. We assume the fre- quentist framework where the data is generated according to a fixed mean vector. We show that if the number of nonzero parameters of the mean vector is known, the horseshoe estimator attains the minimax l2 risk, pos- sibly up to a multiplicative constant. We provide conditions under which the horseshoe estimator combined with an empirical Bayes estimate of the number of nonzero means still yields the minimax risk. We furthermore prove an upper bound on the rate of contraction of the posterior distri- bution around the horseshoe estimator, and a lower bound on the poste- rior variance. These bounds indicate that the posterior distribution of the horseshoe prior may be more informative than that of other one-component priors, including the Lasso.

Validation of Irrigated Ablation for Pulmonary Vein Isolation in Patients with Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation,"Background: Irrigation catheter (Irâ€“C) is in the process of spreading, however, various aspects of efficient and safe usage are well-known. Methods: Consecutive 122 patients with drug-resistant, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who underwent extensive pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using Irâ€“C were analyzed. PVI were performed with irrigated radiofrequency energy, maximum temperature of 42 Â°C, power of 25â€“35 W with constant 17â€“30 ml/min saline infusion. Right-sided and left-sided circular lesions on left atrial antrum encircling the ipsilateral PVs were placed, guided by 3-dimensional mapping and double Lasso technique. Results: PVI was achieved in all patients, and no major complications related to Irâ€“C usage were observed. During one application, mean impedance decrease was 13Â±6 ohm. In the cases with mean time of less than 40 sec for one application (34.9Â±3.8 sec, n=71), compared with cases with mean time of more than 40 sec for one application (43.1Â±2.7 sec, n=51), the number of applications was large (58Â±14 vs. 48Â±14, p<0.001), procedure time was longer (69Â±31 vs. 58Â±22 min, p<0.05), and fluoroscopic time was longer (37Â±15 vs. 32Â±11 min, p<0.05). Conclusions: Irâ€“C was effective and safety for PVI. Applications within mean time of 40 sec might need additional applications, and consequently increased procedure time and fluoroscopic time.",2011,Journal of Arrhythmia
Robust sparse regression and tuning parameter selection via the efficient bootstrap information criteria,"There is currently much discussion about lasso-type regularized regression which is a useful tool for simultaneous estimation and variable selection. Although the lasso-type regularization has several advantages in regression modelling, owing to its sparsity, it suffers from outliers because of using penalized least-squares methods. To overcome this issue, we propose a robust lasso-type estimation procedure that uses the robust criteria as the loss function, imposing L1-type penalty called the elastic net. We also introduce to use the efficient bootstrap information criteria for choosing optimal regularization parameters and a constant in outlier detection. Simulation studies and real data analysis are given to examine the efficiency of the proposed robust sparse regression modelling. We observe that our modelling strategy performs well in the presence of outliers.",2014,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
"Longitudinal deformation models, spatial regularizations and learning strategies to quantify Alzheimer's disease progression","In the context of Alzheimer's disease, two challenging issues are (1) the characterization of local hippocampal shape changes specific to disease progression and (2) the identification of mild-cognitive impairment patients likely to convert. In the literature, (1) is usually solved first to detect areas potentially related to the disease. These areas are then considered as an input to solve (2). As an alternative to this sequential strategy, we investigate the use of a classification model using logistic regression to address both issues (1) and (2) simultaneously. The classification of the patients therefore does not require any a priori definition of the most representative hippocampal areas potentially related to the disease, as they are automatically detected. We first quantify deformations of patients' hippocampi between two time points using the large deformations by diffeomorphisms framework and transport these deformations to a common template. Since the deformations are expected to be spatially structured, we perform classification combining logistic loss and spatial regularization techniques, which have not been explored so far in this context, as far as we know. The main contribution of this paper is the comparison of regularization techniques enforcing the coefficient maps to be spatially smooth (Sobolev), piecewise constant (total variation) or sparse (fused LASSO) with standard regularization techniques which do not take into account the spatial structure (LASSO, ridge and ElasticNet). On a dataset of 103 patients out of ADNI, the techniques using spatial regularizations lead to the best classification rates. They also find coherent areas related to the disease progression.",2014,NeuroImage : Clinical
Robust prediction of later asthma in symptomatic toddlers: A novel approach,"Aim: Many children have asthma-like symptoms in early life, but few develop asthma. Several models for predicting later asthma in symptomatic toddlers have been built, but some included factors that are difficult to assess, and methods used were prone to overfitting, leading to selection or exaggeration of irrelevant factors. We aimed to identify predictors for later asthma avoiding previous limitations. Methods: In a population-based cohort, we selected 1-3 year-olds with respiratory symptoms (current wheeze or recurrent cough) and related healthcare visits. Asthma (current wheeze and treatment) was assessed 5 years (N=1226) and 8 years (N=866) later. The included factors are easy to assess in clinical practice: family history, symptoms at baseline, demographic and perinatal data. We used lasso penalized logistic regression to select predictors. This minimizes the number of included predictors while maximizing area under ROC curve (AUC). Results: Main predictors selected in the model for asthma 5 yrs later (AUC=0.76) were â‰¥4 wheezing attacks in the past 12mo (OR=1.65), wheeze causing breathlessness (3.1) and activity disturbance (2.4), eczema (1.5) and male sex (1.5). Other predictors (OR Conclusion: Among factors easy to assess in symptomatic toddlers, wheeze severity, eczema and male sex are main predictors of asthma in mid-childhood. Because our approach for variable selection avoids overfitting, the resulting prediction models should perform well with new data. However, external validation is needed.

Screening Rules for Lasso with Non-Convex Sparse Regularizers,"Leveraging on the convexity of the Lasso problem , screening rules help in accelerating solvers by discarding irrelevant variables, during the optimization process. However, because they provide better theoretical guarantees in identifying relevant variables, several non-convex regulariz-ers for the Lasso have been proposed in the literature. This work is the first that introduces a screening rule strategy into a non-convex Lasso solver. The approach we propose is based on a iterative majorization-minimization (MM) strategy that includes a screening rule in the inner solver and a condition for propagating screened variables between iterations of MM. In addition to improve efficiency of solvers, we also provide guarantees that the inner solver is able to identify the zeros components of its critical point in finite time. Our experimental analysis illustrates the significant computational gain brought by the new screening rule compared to classical coordinate-descent or proximal gradient descent methods.",2019,ArXiv
Bayesian inference for biomarker discovery in proteomics: an analytic solution,"This paper addresses the question of biomarker discovery in proteomics. Given clinical data regarding a list of proteins for a set of individuals, the tackled problem is to extract a short subset of proteins the concentrations of which are an indicator of the biological status (healthy or pathological). In this paper, it is formulated as a specific instance of variable selection. The originality is that the proteins are not investigated one after the other but the best partition between discriminant and non-discriminant proteins is directly sought. In this way, correlations between the proteins are intrinsically taken into account in the decision. The developed strategy is derived in a Bayesian setting, and the decision is optimal in the sense that it minimizes a global mean error. It is finally based on the posterior probabilities of the partitions. The main difficulty is to calculate these probabilities since they are based on the so-called evidence that require marginalization of all the unknown model parameters. Two models are presented that relate the status to the protein concentrations, depending whether the latter are biomarkers or not. The first model accounts for biological variabilities by assuming that the concentrations are Gaussian distributed with a mean and a covariance matrix that depend on the status only for the biomarkers. The second one is an extension that also takes into account the technical variabilities that may significantly impact the observed concentrations. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) a new Bayesian formulation of the biomarker selection problem, (2) the closed-form expression of the posterior probabilities in the noiseless case, and (3) a suitable approximated solution in the noisy case. The methods are numerically assessed and compared to the state-of-the-art methods (t test, LASSO, Battacharyya distance, FOHSIC) on synthetic and real data from proteins quantified in human serum by mass spectrometry in selected reaction monitoring mode.",2017,EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology
Bryophytes in the Spanish Law,"Spain occupies most of the Iberian Peninsula, besides the Balearic and Canary Islands, and contains a high bryophyte biodiversity in the European context. It might not be the best known region in Europe, but it currently maintains one of the highest numbers of active bryologists, which has allowed a spectacular improvement in the knowledge of its bryoflora in the latest 40-50 years. Depending on the number of infraspecific taxa accepted, the number of bryophyte taxa in Spain ranges between 1.090 and 1.300. Spain shares with the rest of Europe a deep and old anthropogenic alteration of its territory and a low rate of endemism in bryophytes. There are no endemic genera and just six of the endemic Iberian species are exclusively present in peninsular Spain (a scarce 0'5%, and all mosses): Acaulon casasianum, A. dertosense, Didymodon erosus, Microbryum longipes, Orthotrichum casasianum and Pleuridium serrulatum. Endemism is much higher in the Canary Islands, with a total of ten endemic species (Riccia teneriffae, Aloina humilis, Bryum icodense, Entosthodon krausei, Grimmia curviseta, Orthotrichum handiense, Platyhypnidium torrenticola, Rhynchostegiella bourgeana, R. trichophylla and Tortula ampliretis), in other words, 2'1% of the Canaries' bryoflora is endemic, which raises the Spanish total to roughly 1'3%. Nevertheless, a noticeable number of non-endemic taxa occur in Spain but otherwise are either absent or poorly represented in the rest of Europe. For instance, the following: genus Exormotheca, Jubula hutchinsiae, Jungermannia handelii, Lejeunea mandonii, Marchesinia mackaii, Plagiochasma appendiculatum, Riccia crustata, genus Riella, Anacolia menziesii, Anomobryum lusitanicum, Crossidium aberrans, Didymodon sicculus, Goniomitrium seroi, Gymnostomum lanceolatum, Oedipodiella australis, Orthotrichum hispanicum, O. ibericum, O. scanicum, O. tortidontium, O. vittii, Phascum vlassovii, Pterygoneurum squamosum, P. sampaianum, P. subsessile, Racomitrium hespericum, Schizymenium pontevedrensis, Thamnobryum maderense, Triquetrella arapilensis, etc.",2005,
Improved subspace clustering via exploitation of spatial constraints,"We present a novel approach to improving subspace clustering by exploiting the spatial constraints. The new method encourages the sparse solution to be consistent with the spatial geometry of the tracked points, by embedding weights into the sparse formulation. By doing so, we are able to correct sparse representations in a principled manner without introducing much additional computational cost. We discuss alternative ways to treat the missing and corrupted data using the latest theory in robust lasso regression and suggest numerical algorithms so solve the proposed formulation. The experiments on the benchmark Johns Hopkins 155 dataset demonstrate that exploiting spatial constraints significantly improves motion segmentation.",2012,2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
"Targeted Methods for Biomarker Discovery, the Search for a Standard","More often than not biomarker studies analyze large quantities of variables with complicated and generally unknown correlation structure. There are numerous statistical methods which attempt to unravel these variables and determine the underlying mechanism through identification of causally related biomarkers. Results from these methods are generally difficult to interpret and nearly impossible to compare across studies. The FDA has currently called for a standardization of methods and protocol for biomarker detection. In response, we propose targeted variable importance (tVIM) as a standardized method for biomarker discovery. Through the use of targeted Maximum Likelihood, tVIM provides double robust estimates of variable importance along with formal inference. These measures are biologically interpretable as a causal effect under specified conditions, allowing for reproducibility across populations. In this analysis we compare tVIM to four different measures of importance provided by three different statistical methods: univariate linear regression (LM), LASSO penalized multiple regression (Q), and two importance measures from randomForest (RF1 and RF2). Their performance is compared in simulation under conditions of increasing correlation. We are interested in their ability to distinguish â€œtrueâ€ relevant biomarkers from correlated decoy biomarkers. The comparisons are based on the resulting ranked variable list for each method using the importance measures and p-values when available. In simulation, tVIM coupled with a data-adaptive model selection method outperforms linear regression, LASSO, and randomForest and is more resilient to increases in correlation. In application we apply all methods to the Golub et al 1999 Leukemia data and compare the resulting gene lists based on biological relevance. Both LM and tVIM are also applied to the vanâ€™t Veer breast cancer data. We compare them based on the top 10 most important genes. From these results, tVIM appears to rank more biologically relevant genes at the top its list than the other methods. Given extreme correlations, methods to reduce bias and provide realistic gene lists are also discussed.",2008,
You Want Fries with That,"allusion alone. But Frye, another widely read and broadly ranging thinker, managed to make his ideas schematic, almost palpable, by the clarity of his prose and an overriding sense of theme. Like Calasso, Frye was fond of pulling quotations from his prodigious memory and reading to illustrate his large ideas; unlike Calasso, he never merged into the quote and rode off on the resulting tangent. Frye's ideas about literary modes and biblical symbolism remain accessible: easy to remember or teach or apply whether or not you agree with them. It isn't clear that Calasso has any ideas; what he offers is curiosity, a temperament, an atmosphere. u Literature and the Gods is, in itself, a literary masterpiece,"" reads the jacket copy. Maybe that's the trouble.",2016,
Compressive Sensing of Large-Scale Images: An Assumption-Free Approach,"Cost-efficient compressive sensing of big media data with fast reconstructed high-quality results is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a new large-scale image compressive sensing method, composed of operator-based strategy in the context of fixed point continuation method and weighted LASSO with tree structure sparsity pattern. The main characteristic of our method is free from any assumptions and restrictions. The feasibility of our method is verified via simulations and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms.",2015,ArXiv
