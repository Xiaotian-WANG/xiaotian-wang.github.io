"The labrid fish Julis blochii Valenciennes, a junior synonym of Thalassoma pavo (Linneaus)","Julis blochii Valenciennes in Cuvier and Valenciennes (1839), allegedly from the East Indies, a new name for Labrus lunare (non Linnaeus) Bloch (1791), was suspected as a senior synonym of Thalassoma jansenii (Bleeker, 1856). Instead it is a junior synonym of Thalassoma pavo (Linnaeus), a common and widespread eastern Atlantic species, the result of locality error. Two other Atlantic species, T. sanctaehelenae (Valenciennes, 1839) and T. ascensionis (Quoy & Gaimard, 1834), sometimes considered synonymous, are demonstrably distinct.",2004,Zoosystematics and Evolution
Regression Discriminant Analysis (RDA) Variants,"This study is a follow-up to earlier publications on the relationship of least squares regression to FDA. In particular, we focus on the paper; On the Regression Discriminant Analysis (RDA), and its Identical Relationship to the Fisherâ€™s Discriminant Analysis, and argue that since Î²Ì‚ is a vector of coefficients for the least squares regression, given that y âˆˆ (+1,âˆ’1), then a substitution of Î²Ì‚ with either Î²Ì‚ridge or Î²Ì‚lasso gives a regression discriminant analysis variant. We note that both Î²Ì‚ridge and Î²Ì‚lasso are respectively vectors of coefficients for ridge regression and lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), given that y âˆˆ (+1,âˆ’1). We therefore identify Ridge Regression Discriminant Analysis (RRDA) and Lasso Discriminant Analysis (LaDA) as the two regression discriminant analysis variants. Further empirical investigation follows, mainly to show that RRDA and LaDA compete favourably against a known Fisherâ€™s Discriminant Analysis (FDA) variant namely, Regularized Fisherâ€™s Discriminant Analysis (RFDA). Since RRDA, LaDA or RFDA can be used in place of FDA in high dimensions, we further determine the most suitable replacement for FDA assuming we are in high dimensions.",2017,
Genomewide identification of a novel sixâ€LncRNA signature to improve prognosis prediction in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma,"The current prognostic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signatures for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still controversial and need to be optimized by systematic bioinformatics analyses with suitable methods and appropriate patients. Therefore, we performed the study to establish a credible lncRNA signature for HCC outcome prediction and explore the related mechanisms. Based on the lncRNA profile and the clinical data of carefully selected HCC patients (nÂ =Â 164) in TCGA, six of 12727 lncRNAs, MIR22HG, CTC-297N7.9, CTD-2139B15.2, RP11-589N15.2, RP11-343N15.5, and RP11-479G22.8 were identified as the independent predictors of patients' overall survival in HCC by sequential univariate Cox and 1000 times Cox LASSO regression with 10-fold CV, and multivariate Cox analysis with 1000 times bootstrapping. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis with patients trichotomized by the six-lncRNA signature, high-risk patients showed significantly shorter survival than mid- and low-risk patients (log-rank test PÂ <Â 0.0001). According to the ROCs, the six-lncRNA signature showed superior predictive capacity than the two existing four-lncRNA combinations and the traditional prognostic clinicopathological parameter TNM stage. Furthermore, low MIR22HG and CTC-297N7.9, but high CTD-2139B15.2, RP11-589N15.2, RP11-343N15.5, and RP11-479G22.8, were, respectively, demonstrated to be related with the malignant phenotypes of HCC. Functionally, the six lncRNAs were disclosed to involve in the regulation of multiple cell cycle and stress response-related pathways via mediating transcription regulation and chromatin modification. In conclusion, our study identified a novel six-lncRNA signature for resectable HCC prognosis prediction and indicated the underlying mechanisms of HCC progression and the potential functions of the six lncRNAs awaiting further elucidation.",2018,Cancer Medicine
Adaptive LASSO hyperspectral unmixing using ADMM,"In this paper, a method of hyperspectral unmixing for the linear regression model is introduced. The proposed algorithm employs an adaptive lasso problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for unmixing process. Indeed, we formulate a weighted l1 norm problem under the reasonable given error to reconstruct the fractional abundances and to avoid inconsistent end member selection in a sparse semi-supervised hyperspectral imaging process. We show that this problem can be efficiently solved by appropriate selection of functions and parameters appearing in the ADMM approach. First, we enforce both non-negativity and full additivity constraints of the abundance fractions in the objective function. Then, we apply the ADMM algorithm to solve the acquired optimization problem. Our simulations show that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean square error and reconstruction signal-to-noise-ratio with reasonably reduced computational costs.",2014,2014 27th Biennial Symposium on Communications (QBSC)
Neural decoding of code modulated visual evoked potentials by spatio-temporal inverse filtering for brain computer interfaces.,"This study addresses neural decoding of a code modulated visual evoked potentials (c-VEPs). c-VEP was recently developed, and applied to brain computer interfaces (BCIs). c-VEP BCI exhibits faster communication speed than existing VEP-based BCIs. In c-VEP BCI, the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) that maximizes the correlation between an averaged signal and single trial signals is often used for the spatial filter. However, CCA does not utilize information of given PN sequence, and hence, the filtered signal may not have properties of PN sequence. In this paper, we propose a decoding method to restore the given PN sequence from the observed VEP. We compare linear and nonlinear spatio-temporal inverse filtering methods. For the linear method, the least mean square error and lasso are used to obtain the filter coefficients. For the non-linear method, the artificial neural network is used. The proposed methods exhibited better decoding performance, and higher classification accuracies than conventional CCA spatial filtered c-VEP BCI.",2016,Conference proceedings : ...

Perovskite and Related Structure Systems,"Perovskite and perovskite-related structures are important crystallographic structures particularly for oxide functional materials because most of the newly discovered functional materials belong to this category (for a complete list of perovskite structures, see Galasso, 1969, 1990). Typical perovskite materials of technological interests are piezoelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, electrostrictive Pb(Mg,Nb)O3, and magnetoresistance (La,Ca)MnO3. There is much interest in exploiting the mystery of the perovskite structure and its family for understanding the functionality of materials, such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, magnetoresistance, ionic conductivity, and dielectricity. Therefore, understanding perovskite and related structures is essential for research in functional materials because it could lead to discovering new materials with superior properties and unique functionality.",1998,
Sparse discriminative region selection algorithm for face recognition,"We introduce a sparse region selection problem and an effective solution algorithm where one seeks for a small subset of points in a two-dimensional plane (e.g., image) that are considered to be the most important. Its direct application is the face recognition in machine vision in which we aim to find a group of key pixels in a facial image that are the most salient in discriminating subjects from others. Sparseness plays a key role in enhancing the prediction performance since observed data often contain considerable amount of noise potentially. In addition to the sparseness constraint, the active features need to be spatially coherent so as to form meaningful contiguous areas, not just random scatters. We formulate the problem and approximate it as convex optimization with nonnegative L1 constraints, where we introduce an efficient solution method that modifies the gradient Lasso algorithm that was previously used for solving convex problems with L1 constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed approach not only yields superior prediction performance to the existing methods on several real-world benchmark face datasets, but also discovers regions around the key facial features such as eyes/eyebrows and nose/mouth that are widely believed to be important for face recognition.",2014,Applied Intelligence
Bayesian Variable Selections for Probit Models with Componentwise Gibbs Samplers,"This article considers Bayesian variable selection problems for binary responses via stochastic search variable selection and Bayesian Lasso. To avoid matrix inversion in the corresponding Markov chain Monte Carlo implementations, the componentwise Gibbs sampler (CGS) idea is adopted. Moreover, we also propose automatic hyperparameter tuning rules for the proposed approaches. Simulation studies and a real example are used to demonstrate the performances of the proposed approaches. These results show that CGS approaches do not only have good performances in variable selection but also have the lower batch mean standard error values than those of original methods, especially for large number of covariates.",2016,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
"Early Cretaceous Spore and Pollen Assemblages of Kailu Basin,nei Mongol","The Liaohe Oil Company has more than 150 wells of different kinds drilled in the Kailu Basin, and the first well, Lushen 1 was drilled there in 1987. The author has made laboratory analysis on more than 1500 core samples from more than 20 wells, obtained a large quantity of sporopollen fossils with first hand data accumulated. In the study, systematic integration and research has been done on the palaeobiological data for the recent 20 years, three sporopollen assemblages of the Early Cretaceous have been established with their features listed, in ascending order they are the cicatricosisporites-cancovissimisporites-Classopollis Assemblage of the Jiufutang Formation,the Cicatricosisporites-Abdiverrucospora-Piceaepollenites Assemblage of the Shahai Formation,and the Cicatricosisporites-Laevigatosporites-Pilosisporites-Asteropollis Assemblage of the Fuxin Formation.In addition, comparisons are made with foreign and other domestic sporopollen assemblages. Based on the above, the Early Cretaceous biostratigrapgic sequence and geological datings have been established in the study area,and they have important significances for the hydrocarbon exploration and the studies on the Cretaceous sequence, biota and age assignment.",2006,
Wiatraki na Å»uÅ‚awach w pierwszej poÅ‚owie XV w.,"Windmills in the Å»ulawy Region during the First Half of the Fifteenth Century (Summary) Studies on the living conditions of the rural population and the organisation of agriculture in the Middle Ages have a long tradition. Some of the issues examined include mills in the State of the Teutonic Order. Other publications consider the specific nature of the Å»ulawy region under the Teutonic Order and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This article focuses on reconstructing the significance of windmills for the mill economy in this area. The mills within the Teutonic State were supervised by a number of administrative units. The northern part of Gdansk Å»ulawy (known in the Middle Ages as Stublau (in Pol. Steblewskie or Å»ulawy Male) was administered by the forestry office of the Danzig (Gdansk) commandry, the strip of land between the Vistula and the River Mottlau (Motlawa) was governed by a Vogt whose seat was in Herrengrebin (Grabiny Zameczek) itself under the commandry of Marienburg (Malbork), while the southern part was supervised by the Vogt of Dirschau (Tczew). Gross Werder (Great Å»ulawy) was administered by the commandry of Marienburg, and Fischauer Werder (Fiszewskie Å»ulawy) â€“ by the Komtur (commander) of Elbing (ElblÄ…g) and Christburg (Dzierzgon). The different principles of administering these regions resulted predominantly from the local water conditions and the need for the farmlandâ€™s constant drainage. One of the elements of the regionâ€™s specificity was the organisation of flourmilling, which owing to geographical conditions could not be based on a network of water mills, as was the case elsewhere. Water mills were therefore replaced by windmills, which became a prominent element of Å»ulawyâ€™s milling industry in the Middle Ages, perhaps even in the first half of the fourteenth century, and continued to play this role in successive centuries. The data quoted clearly show that windmills were the foundation of the milling industry in the Scharpau (now: Szkarpawa) region and played a significant role in Stublau, where the Order owned one water mill in Herrengrebin. It would seem that they were also of fundamental significance in the Vogtei of Leske (Laski) and the area under the Pfl eger of Lassowitz (Lasowice) and Montau (MÄ…towy). In the territory under the Vogt of Stuhm (Sztum) the mills fulfilled auxiliary functions. The mills in question subsequently functioned not only as flour mills, associated with farm production, but also helped drain farmland threatened by flooding. They continued to fulfil this role until the early 1900s, and their subsequent destruction and ensuing absence in the landscape were accelerated by the destruction of mounds by the fleeing Germans at the end of the war, as well as the profound transformations which affected all domains of social life in this area following World War II. Owing to the specific local conditions, mills were usually erected on the same sites as they had been in the Middle Ages; only the method of their construction changed (early modern novelties included the Dutch mills). In subsequent years, mills for land drainage were used on a larger scale alongside grist mills. Unfortunately, only two such mills have survived: a post mill in Schonbaum (Drewnica) and a Dutch mill in Palschau (Palczewo), which are testimony of the great diversity of the local material culture and organisation of the rural economy in past centuries.",2012,
The Third Quintero Brother,"For half a century now the fame of Don Serafin and Don Joaquin Alvarez Quintero has been world-wide. They are loved and respected, and their plays are known and enjoyed in both hemispheres. Little attention has been paid, however, to the literary merit of the eldest Quintero, Don Pedro, whom his brothers called ""paz y aliento de nuestras vidas"" (1). This gentle spirit was the greatest single influence in moulding the dramatic genius-and the characters and tastes as well-of Don Serafin and Don Joaquin. Consequently, as their mentor and chief critic he is necessarily of interest to all Quintero aficionados. But he is likewise deserving of consideration in his own person as a thinker and writer of no mean ability. In this paper, then, we make brief and belated recognition of the contribution of Don Pedro Alvarez Quintero to literature, not only in his capacity of adviser to his brothers, but also in his own right as a competent man of letters. Don Pedro was born in Andalusia in 1869. Thus he was two years older than Don Serafin (1871-1938) and almost four years older than Don Joaquin (18731944). His photograph shows a sensitive, intelligent face, with a marked family resemblance to his two brothers, and especially to Don Joaquin. He has a rather dreamy, melancholy expression that bespeaks the moral crises which tormented him, and a certain delicacy of features that is perhaps indicative of his precarious health. His picture does not show the serenity and the twinkle of good humor that are so apparent in the likenesses of the other Quinteros. As a boy in Seville, Don Pedro, like his brothers, was interested in journalism. Their father bought the three a weekly newspaper, Perecito, the director of which was one Leoncio Lasso de la Vega, an unsuccessful Sevillian writer and poet. Don Serafin and Don Joaquin, then fourteen and thirteen years old, wrote assiduously-in verse, usually-for every number of this paper. But Don Pedro, in his painful modesty and fear lest his work be publicized, would write not a single line. He was at this period, nevertheless, contributing regularly to other weeklies in Seville, under pseudonyms or anonymously. Convinced, and wrongly so, that writing was not for him, young Pedro turned to preparation for a career in natural sciences, being led in this direction by some beloved boyhood friends who were studying in this field. He won the esteem of his professors and, as long as his own enthusiasm lasted, was able to kindle the interest of his fellow-students in their subject. Suddenly, however, he decided that he had not been born to be a naturalist, and he returned to the pursuit of letters.",1949,Hispania
Rare and little-known fishes in the eastern Adriatic during last two decades,"Backgrounds and Purpose: Studies of the ichthyological fauna from the Adriatic waters began in 18(th) century. Many other authors making lists of the Adriatic fish species during 19 and 20(th) century and some of them with special emphasis on the occurences of rare species in the Adriatic Sea. The goal of this paper is to check the status of some fish species, which were considered to be rare in anyway in the Adriatic Sea, according to new records in last two decades. In addition, we have listed what seem to be exceptional occurrences to the north or south of species which are relatively common elsewhere with the intention of documenting and potential alteration in the distribution of fish fauna to climatic changes. Material and Methods: Records of specimens submitted are followed by initials indicating the source, a full list of collaborators is given at the end of the list of records. Records from published sources are acknowledged in the usual way except that newspaper reports are cited in the text by the following abbreviations and the date of the issue cited, Records are given in a sequence of year, month, and day (when known), and locality with position and depth. This is followed by the number of specimens if more than one, total length and weight, and the source of the record. Whenever one or more item is lacking it is because data not available to the authors. Results: Records of occurrence of rare and little-known fishes in the Eastern Adriatic for the years from 1980 to 2001 are given. The significance of these records is discussed briefly in some cases, According to our investigations, most of the species declared seems to be more common that used to be in the past (for example, Balistes carolinensis, Thalassoma pavo, Cetorhinus maximus, Sparisoma cretense, Coryphaena hippurus) so we could treated them as relatively rare or common fish species, The fact is that the number of alien fish species immigrant in the Adriatic Sea is rapidly increasing in the last years. The alien fishes records analysis is showing a tropical affinity species immigration. Conclusion: During the last 20 years, changes in the quantitative and qualitative composition of the Adriatic ichthyofauna have been noted. The numbers of thermophillic species have increased and several species, previously scarce or rare, have become more abundant, while others are new records. These observations can be related to oceanographic changes in the Adriatic Sea.",2002,Periodicum Biologorum
Bayesian variable selection based on clinical relevance weights in small sample studiesâ€”Application to colon cancer,"Using clinical data to model the medical decisions behind sequential treatment actions raises methodological challenges. Physicians often have access to many covariates that may be used when making sequential treatment decisions for individual patients. Statistical variable selection methods may help finding which of these variables are used for this decision in everyday practice. When the sample size is not large, Bayesian variable selection methods can address this setting and allow for expert information to be incorporated into prior distributions. Motivated by clinical practice data involving repeated dose adaptation for Irinotecan in colorectal metastatic cancer, we propose a modification of the stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) method, which we call weight-based SSVS (WBS). We use clinical relevance weights elicited from physician experts to construct prior distributions, with the goal to identify the most influential toxicities and other covariates used for dose adjustment. We evaluate and compare the WBS model performance to the Lasso and SSVS through an extensive simulation study. The simulations show that WBS has better performance and lower rates of false positives and false negatives than the other methods but depends strongly on the covariate weights.",2019,Statistics in Medicine
Thermal load forecasting in district heating networks using deep learning and advanced feature selection methods,"Recent research has seen several forecasting methods being applied for heat load forecasting of district heating networks. This paper presents two methods that gain significant improvements compared to the previous works. First, an automated way of handling non-linear dependencies in linear models is presented. In this context, the paper implements a new method for feature selection based on [1], resulting in computationally efficient models with higher accuracies. The three main models used here are linear, ridge, and lasso regression. In the second approach, a deep learning method is presented. Although computationally more intensive, the deep learning model provides higher accuracy than the linear models with automated feature selection. Finally, we compare and contrast the proposed methods with earlier work for day-ahead forecasting of heat load in two different district heating networks.",2018,Energy
Advantages and limitations of shot-gun proteomic analyses on Arabidopsis plants with altered MAPK signaling,"The molecular mechanism of signal transduction by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in plants is an intensive research field of contemporary plant biology. Signaling in plants involves perception of changing environment and the intracellular transduction of such generated information leading to the activation of adaptive mechanisms or programmed cell death, as it is in the case of hypersensitive response to some biotrophic pathogen attack. At the molecular level, distinct signaling pathways, such as MAPK modules, involve reversible phosphorylation, enzymatic activation, protein-protein interaction and finally transcriptional activation via nuclear-resident transcription factors or cell reorganization via regulation of cytoplasmic or plasma membrane-associated proteins. All these processes are strictly regulated and subcellularly compartmentalized. 
 
Modern OMICS technologies encompassing transcriptomic (Krysan et al., 2002; Frei dit Frey et al., 2014), metabolomic (Lassowskat et al., 2014), proteomic (Miles et al., 2009; Conroy et al., 2013; Lassowskat et al., 2014; Takac et al., 2014) and phosphoproteomic (Hoehenwarter et al., 2013; Lassowskat et al., 2014) approaches have been employed to gain functional information on plant signaling. The main challenges of advanced (phospho)proteomic studies are: reliable identification of all signaling constituents of a particular MAPK pathway as well as identification and validation of respective target proteins. In this opinion article, we aim to briefly evaluate benefits and pitfalls of various proteomic approaches that are used to study MAPK signaling in plants. We emphasize on the advantages of comparative shot-gun proteomic analyses of Arabidopsis mutants and transgenic plants with altered MAPK signaling. The importance of critical data validation and interpretation is also discussed.",2015,Frontiers in Plant Science
Gut Microbiota Functional Biomolecules With Immune-Lipid Metabolism for a Prognostic Compound Score in Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Gastric Adenocarcinoma: A Pilot Study,"OBJECTIVE
Increasing evidence has indicated an association between gut microbiota in gastrointestinal cancer and clinical outcome. Herein, we aim to develop a prognosis-prediction tool based on an immune-lipid metabolism signature, tumor cell-associated immune microenvironment, and lipid metabolism proteins inferred from the function of gut microbiota.


METHODS
16S gene ribosomal RNA sequencing was performed on 10 fecal samples obtained after tumor resection but before chemotherapy (EBVaGC = 4 and EBVnGC = 6). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was applied to screening for highly accurate marker proteins. A compound score based on the fraction of screened markers was then constructed using a LASSO logistic regression model.


RESULTS
The Tax4Fun analysis based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes data indicated differentially expressed tumor pathway between EBVnGC and EBVaGC. Using the LASSO logistic model, a compound score was established consisting of 14 types of immune microenvironment and lipid metabolism proteins. In the training set (378 patients), significant differences were found between high- and low-compound score groups in overall survival across and within subpopulations with an identical EBV. Multivariable analysis revealed that the compound score was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval = 2.28-3.36). The prognostic value ;of the compound score was also confirmed in the validation (162 patients) and entire (540 patients) sets.


DISCUSSION
The proposed compound score is a promising signature for estimating overall survival in patients with gastric cancer having EBVaGCs or EBVnGCs.",2019,Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology
Dental microwear study of pigs from the classical site of Sagalassos (SW Turkey) as an aid for the reconstruction of husbandry practices in ancient times,"AbstractMicrowear analysis of pig teeth from the classical site of Sagalassos (SW Turkey) is undertaken to obtain insight into pig management strategies in this region from the 1st to 7th centuries AD. Earlier research on modern pigs revealed significant differences in microwear patterns between stall-fed and free-ranging, rooting individuals. A comparison of the microwear data of the Sagalassos pig with those from archaeological and modern pigs with a known or presumed type of management shows that the microwear of the Sagalassos pigs is very different. It is suggested that the Sagalassos pigs had a very soft, non-abrasive diet, that in the first instance cannot be attributed to either management type. Therefore, the nature of the substrate on which the animals were foraging and its impact on microwear are considered and the microwear data are compared with the results of previous archaeozoological research carried out at the site. Further, diachronic changes in microwear patterns are investigated.",2009,Environmental Archaeology
A Note on Application of Nesterovâ€™s Method in Solving Lasso-Type Problems,"Many different algorithms have been proposed to solve penalized variable selection problems, in particular lasso and its variants, including group lasso and fused lasso. Loss functions other than quadratic loss also pose significant challenges for finding efficient solvers. Here, we note that Nesterovâ€™s method can be used to transform an optimization problem with general smooth convex loss to quadratic loss with identity covariate matrix in each iteration. After such reduction, the problem becomes much easier to solve or even can be solved in closed form in some cases. We perform some simulations and apply our implementation to phoneme discrimination.",2015,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
"""Marginal"" Landscapes: Human Activity, Vulnerability, and Resilience in the Western Taurus Mountains (Southwest Turkey)","abstract:The western Taurus mountains, southwest Turkey, comprise a diverse set of landscape zones that are characterized by great altitude variations. This article focuses on the agricultural so-called marginal highlands within this mountainous region. Large parts of the uplands are labeled ""marginal"" nowadays as they are not regarded as highly productive in terms of agricultural output or permanent occupation. Three decades of interdisciplinary research within the Sagalassos Archaeological Research Project (KU Leuven) have provided an enormous amount of archaeological, bioarchaeological, and geoarchaeological datasets that will be brought together in this article to explore diachronic patterns in human-environmental interactions within these areas. The study demonstrates not only the archaeological value of a highland area, but its vulnerability for human impact as well. The changing environments both naturally and sociopolitically favored a more resilient behavior of the human groups within the highlands.",2019,Journal of Eastern Mediterranean Archaeology and Heritage Studies
The Unique Existence of Periodic Solution for a Class of Ordinary Differential Equation Systems at Resonance,"Early in 1904,Hadamard [1] got the scale implicit function theorem of finite di-mensions.Then it was generalized to infinite dimensions.Here a new proof of this the-orem is given and used to discuss the unique existence of periodic solution for a classof ordinary differential eqcation systems at resonance.",1986,
Hierarchically penalized support vector machine with grouped variables,"When input features are naturally grouped or generated by factors in a linear classification problem, it is more meaningful to identify important groups or factors rather than individual features. The Fâˆž-norm support vector machine (SVM) and the group lasso penalized SVM have been developed to perform simultaneous classification and factor selection. However, these group-wise penalized SVM methods may suffer from estimation inefficiency and model selection inconsistency because they cannot perform feature selection within an identified group. To overcome this limitation, we propose the hierarchically penalized SVM (H-SVM) that not only effectively identifies important groups but also removes irrelevant features within an identified group. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed H-SVM over existing SVM methods.",2017,International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics
Identification of sparse neural functional connectivity using penalized likelihood estimation and basis functions,"One key problem in computational neuroscience and neural engineering is the identification and modeling of functional connectivity in the brain using spike train data. To reduce model complexity, alleviate overfitting, and thus facilitate model interpretation, sparse representation and estimation of functional connectivity is needed. Sparsities include global sparsity, which captures the sparse connectivities between neurons, and local sparsity, which reflects the active temporal ranges of the input-output dynamical interactions. In this paper, we formulate a generalized functional additive model (GFAM) and develop the associated penalized likelihood estimation methods for such a modeling problem. A GFAM consists of a set of basis functions convolving the input signals, and a link function generating the firing probability of the output neuron from the summation of the convolutions weighted by the sought model coefficients. Model sparsities are achieved by using various penalized likelihood estimations and basis functions. Specifically, we introduce two variations of the GFAM using a global basis (e.g., Laguerre basis) and group LASSO estimation, and a local basis (e.g., B-spline basis) and group bridge estimation, respectively. We further develop an optimization method based on quadratic approximation of the likelihood function for the estimation of these models. Simulation and experimental results show that both group-LASSO-Laguerre and group-bridge-B-spline can capture faithfully the global sparsities, while the latter can replicate accurately and simultaneously both global and local sparsities. The sparse models outperform the full models estimated with the standard maximum likelihood method in out-of-sample predictions.",2013,Journal of Computational Neuroscience

Nachweis und Charakterisierung von Clostridium perfringens mittels real-time-PCR,"Zuszammenfassung:Clostridium perfringens gehÃ¶rt zur Gruppe der gram-positiven, anaerob bzw. aerotolerant wachsenden Bakterien. AbhÃ¤ngig von der FÃ¤higkeit der einzelnen C. perfringens StÃ¤mme, alpha-, beta-, epsilon und iota-Toxin zu bilden, erfolgt eine Einteilung in die Typen A bis E, wobei C. perfringens Typ A fÃ¼r den Ã¼berwiegenden Teil der lebensmittelassoziierten menschlichen Erkrankungen verantwortlich ist. Ursache solcher Toxin-Infektionen ist das erst im Darm im Rahmen der Sporulation der mit den Lebensmitteln aufgenommenen vegetativen Zellen gebildete Enterotoxin (CpE). In der Regel muss sich der Erreger im Lebensmittel auf mehr als 106 KbE/g Lebensmittel vermehren, damit beim Konsumenten eine Erkrankung ausgelÃ¶st wird (BVET, 2005; BfR, 2005). Da die derzeit vorhandenen kulturellen Nachweisverfahren keine MÃ¶glichkeit bieten, die gewonnenen Isolate einem bestimmten Toxintyp zuzuordnen, kann der Nachweis von C. perfringens in einem Lebensmittel nach gÃ¼ltiger Rechtslage lediglich als ein Hinweis auf eine mangelhafte Produktions- oder Verarbeitungtechnologie oder auf das Vorliegen einer lebensmittelbedingten Toxin-Infektion gewertet werden. Zum Nachweis der Toxingene, die eine Einteilung von C. perfringens in die fÃ¼nf verschiedene Toxintypen ermÃ¶glichen, wurden drei Duplex-real-time-PCR-Assays etabliert und die EinsatzmÃ¶glichkeiten in der Routinediagnostik getestet. Die Systeme sollen fÃ¼r einen schnellen Nachweis und eine rasche Differenzierung von C. perfringens sowie als Screening-System bei Verdacht auf eine lebensmittelbedingte Erkrankung genutzt werden.Abstract:Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium. The strains are classified into five types (type A to E), depending on the ability to produce alpha-, beta-, epsiloon and iota-toxin, but food-poisonings are mostly caused by C. perfringens type A isolates. Ingestion of contaminated food is followed by gastrointestinal disease, when enzyme-resistant C. perfringens enterotoxins (CpE) are set free during sporulation. In most cases the bacterium has to grow up to more than 106 cfu/g food to cause a gastrointestinal disease (BVET, 2005; BfR, 2005). Cultural methods, normally used for the detection of C. perfringens, are not able to differentiate isolates into the five different toxin types. This is the reason, why the detection of C. perfringens in food under the present legal regulations can only used as an indication for inadequate production hygiene or a toxin-infection with contaminated food as source.For the detection of the toxin genes to differentiate C. perfringens in five different toxin types, three duplex real-time-PCR assays for the routine diagnostic were developed and validated. The assays can be used for quick detection and easy classification of C. perfringens isolates and as a rapid screening-system in suspected cases of C. perfringens food-poisonings.",2007,Journal fÃ¼r Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit
A species of Thalassomyxa (Promycetozoida) from the North Coast of Jamaica,"Summary Like the type species, Thalassomyxa ausiralis (GRELL 1985). Thalassomyxa jamaicensis n. sp. displays a periodic change between a motile and a resting phase. The two species show characteristic differences in the stages of both phases. A specific peculiarity of Thalassomyxa jamaicensis n. sp. is the phenomenon that the stages of the resting phase undergo equal, unequal or multiple divisions. When diatoms (Amphiprora sp.) are used as food organisms, all divisional types lead to small, almost equal-sized products which detach from the substrate, round off and float in the sea water (floating spheres, tomites). This comes about when the diatom lawn becomes exhausted. If fed with flagellates (Dunaliella sp.. Pyrenomonas sp.), no floating spheres are fonned. but the divisions of the resting stages permit a multiplication of the species and make its cultivation possible.",1992,Archiv fÃ¼r Protistenkunde
Stokes drag on conglomerates of spheres,"The Stokes drag coefficients for conglomerates of between two and 167 spheres are obtained from a recently developed scheme for numerical calculations of hydrodynamic interactions [J. Chem. Phys. 100, 3780 (1994)]. Experimental data for these conglomerates were provided by Lasso and Weidmann [Phys. Fluids 29, 3921 (1986)]. The numerical results and the experimental data agree very well. It is shown that in numerical calculations of hydrodynamic interactions, all longâ€range contributions must be included exactly.",1995,Physics of Fluids
On the importance of local and global analysis in the judgment of similarity and dissimilarity of faces,"Abstract The ability to recognize faces and to detect differences and similarities between faces has proved to be fundamental in the evolution of humans and in the conditioning of their social behaviors. In this paper, we investigate basic mechanisms underlying this ability, focusing in particular on the relevance of local and global features and on some interesting differences characterizing judgments of similarity with respect to judgments of dissimilarity. In a first experiment, a set of participants is involved in order to evaluate the human response with respect to a simple judgment protocol based on two-alternative forced choice. Triplets of face stimuli are evaluated first with the aim of identifying (between two candidate faces) the face more similar to a reference face. The protocol is then repeated for the same triplets but involving a different set of participants and asking to identify the face less similar to a reference face. These visual judgments of similarity and dissimilarity are finally analyzed and compared with the results of a closely related computational experiment based on the same set of triplets; in this case, however, the similarity-dissimilarity measure is derived by automatically extracting facial points and matching with regression techniques (LASSO and Elastic Net) two configurations of image descriptors: the first capturing holistic information, the second capturing local information, that is few localized facial features. Our results suggest that computational models based on holistic cues (emphasizing the concept of the whole as a composed set of interdependent parts) better fit judgments of humans participating to the first experiment (similarity judgments). On the other hand, models based on spatially localized cues do not offer significant accuracy. Vice versa, computational models based on local cues better fit dissimilarity judgments and are less adequate to express similarity information. Notably, our results provide some empirical evidence that local and global cues are both important in face perception, but with different roles. This finding supports the hypothesis that similarity and dissimilarity should not merely be considered as opposing concepts, as they could derive from different processing paths.",2019,Image Vis.

â€œAirborneâ€ suture tying technique: Simple steps to make it easy,"A multitude of microsurgical suture techniques have been described. Although accurate apposition and eversion of the vessel ends is paramount for the patency of anastomosis, rapidity is usually of secondary importance. However, in situations in which either multiple anastomoses are required or timely revascularization is crucial, speed becomes a determinant factor for eventual success. ""Airborne"" suture tying is aimed at decreasing operative time by streamlining the microvascular anastomosis. Over the years, several considerations have emerged as key points for achieving mastery of this helpful maneuver. Herein, we simplify the technique by breaking the maneuver into 2 components: the ""charioteer"" loop and the ""lasso"" loop. Relevant literature, indications, and benefits are discussed followed by step-by-step descriptions. Both back table and in vivo video demonstrations are presented online.",2017,Head & Neck
Change-point estimation in high dimensional linear regression models via sparse group Lasso,"In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating change-points in a high dimensional linear regression model. In the model considered, the linear coefficients have high dimensions, are sparse, and undergo multiple changes in the given data samples. Our goal is to estimate the number and locations of change-points and sparse coefficients in each of the intervals between change-points. We develop a sparse group Lasso (SGL) based approach to solve the proposed problem. Under certain assumptions and using a properly chosen regularization parameter, we show that estimation error of linear coefficients and change-point locations can be expressed as a function of the number of data point, the dimension of the model and the sparse level. From the derived error function, we then characterize the conditions under which the proposed estimator is consistent. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the performance of our approach.",2015,"2015 53rd Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)"
Yeasts in Hypersaline Habitats,"For a long time, halotolerant yeasts were known exclusively as contaminants of food preserved with high concentrations of salt or sugar. Their presence in natural thalassohaline hypersaline environments was unknown until 2000, when they were first reported to be active inhabitants of man-made solar salterns in Slovenia. Since then, they have been described on the surface of halophytic plants, in salt mines, in cold and temperate saline lakes, in brine and bittern of different solar salterns on three continents and in MgCl2-dominated waters of the Dead Sea. Yeasts in these environments can be described as halotolerant, extremely halotolerant and even extremely chaotolerant. The dominant representatives are different ascomycetous black yeast species, mainly of the genera Hortaea and Phaeotheca; non-melanised ascomycetous yeasts from the genera Candida, Debaryomyces, Meyerozyma, Metschnikowia, Pichia and Yarrowia; and basidiomycetous yeasts from the genera Bulleromyces, Cryptococcus, Cutaneotrichosporon, Papiliotrema, Rhodosporidium, Rhodotorula, Solicoccozyma, Sterigmatomyces and Vishniacozyma. Until the discovery and description of indigenous saltern mycobiota, the physiological and molecular mechanisms relating to salt tolerance in eukaryotic microorganisms were studied using salt-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the model organism. Nowadays, most studies focus on halotolerant yeast species like Debaryomyces hansenii, Aureobasidium pullulans and Hortaea werneckii, which have been isolated globally from natural hypersaline environments and can tolerate up to 10%, 15% and 30% NaCl, respectively. Studies of halotolerant yeasts at the molecular level continue to unravel the complexity of the adaptations needed for yeasts to cope with the problems of ion toxicity and low water activity that are characteristic of hypersaline environments.",2017,
Robust Recovery of Low-Rank Matrices with Non-Orthogonal Sparse Decomposition from Incomplete Measurements.,"We consider the problem of recovering an unknown effectively $(s_1,s_2)$-sparse low-rank-$R$ matrix $X$ with possibly non-orthogonal rank-$1$ decomposition from incomplete and inaccurate linear measurements of the form $y = \mathcal A (X) + \eta$, where $\eta$ is an ineliminable noise. We first derive an optimization formulation for matrix recovery under the considered model and propose a novel algorithm, called Alternating Tikhonov regularization and Lasso (A-T-LA$\text{S}_{2,1}$), to solve it. The algorithm is based on a multi-penalty regularization, which is able to leverage both structures (low-rankness and sparsity) simultaneously. The algorithm is a fast first order method, and straightforward to implement. We prove global convergence for any linear measurement model to stationary points and local convergence to global minimizers. By adapting the concept of restricted isometry property from compressed sensing to our novel model class, we prove error bounds between global minimizers and ground truth, up to noise level, from a number of subgaussian measurements scaling as $R(s_1+s_2)$, up to log-factors in the dimension, and relative-to-diameter distortion. Simulation results demonstrate both the accuracy and efficacy of the algorithm, as well as its superiority to the state-of-the-art algorithms in strong noise regimes and for matrices, whose singular vectors do not possess exact (joint-) sparse support.",2019,arXiv: Numerical Analysis
"The occurrence of phosphate minerals in lacustrine clayey diatomite deposits, Thessaly, Central Greece","Abstract Irregular masses, veins and leaf replacements composed of the phosphate minerals vivianite, mitridatite, anapaite and hydroxylapatite occur in the Sarantaporoâ€“Elassona Upper Miocene lacustrine basin, Thessaly, central Greece. They are hosted in clayey diatomite. Grey to dull green irregular veins of anapaite up to 40Â cm thick and spherical concretions up to 2Â cm in diameter sporadically occurred at shallow depths. Minor hydroxylapatite rims anapaite masses. Mitridatite occurs in the near surface as greenish-brown veins 5Â cm thick, cutting the diatomite or oriented sub-parallel to bedding. The mitridatite veins are rimmed by, and grade into, iron oxidesâ€“hydroxides at the surface. In borehole samples, at depths greater than 40Â m, bluish vivianite frequently replaces leaves and faecal pellets up to 2Â cm in diameter. Conditions permitting the precipitation of phosphate minerals in the basin were the deposition of organic matter, a highly reducing environment at depth (possibly in the lake water but certainly in the bottom sediment), and a low availability of calcium during sedimentation, but its subsequent moderate enrichment in groundwater. The kind of phosphate formed depended on the diagenetic microenvironment. The diagenetic environment was slightly alkaline (8>pH>7). The Ca 2+ /Fe 2+ and Ca 2+ phosphates (i.e. anapaite and hydroxylapatite) that occur at shallow burial depths, most likely formed at the expense of the originally formed Fe 2+ -phosphate vivianite. The progressive substitution of Fe by Ca is attributed to the action of Ca-rich groundwater. The alteration of the ferrous phosphate anapaite to the ferric phosphate mitridatite, plus amorphous iron hydroxides and goethite at the surface, is an indicator of strongly oxidising conditions. The Fe 2+ ions of the phosphates were derived from the leaching of the ultrabasic and schist basement rocks. The absence of calcite in the diatomite reflects the low calcium content of the lake water during sedimentation. The presence of smectite and vermiculite promoted the adsorption of phosphate ions in the sediments of the basin. The accumulation of Fe indicates of the presence of a eutrophic lake environment. The phosphate minerals further suggest stagnant bottom waters and high biological productivity that was promoted by warmâ€“humid conditions.",2001,Sedimentary Geology
A robust multiple-locus method for quantitative trait locus analysis of non-normally distributed multiple traits,"Linear regression-based quantitative trait loci/association mapping methods such as least squares commonly assume normality of residuals. In genetics studies of plants or animals, some quantitative traits may not follow normal distribution because the data include outlying observations or data that are collected from multiple sources, and in such cases the normal regression methods may lose some statistical power to detect quantitative trait loci. In this work, we propose a robust multiple-locus regression approach for analyzing multiple quantitative traits without normality assumption. In our method, the objective function is least absolute deviation (LAD), which corresponds to the assumption of multivariate Laplace distributed residual errors. This distribution has heavier tails than the normal distribution. In addition, we adopt a group LASSO penalty to produce shrinkage estimation of the marker effects and to describe the genetic correlation among phenotypes. Our LAD-LASSO approach is less sensitive to the outliers and is more appropriate for the analysis of data with skewedly distributed phenotypes. Another application of our robust approach is on missing phenotype problem in multiple-trait analysis, where the missing phenotype items can simply be filled with some extreme values, and be treated as outliers. The efficiency of the LAD-LASSO approach is illustrated on both simulated and real data sets.",2015,Heredity

Correlation between sun exposure and fish consummation and plasma vitamin D level in physiotherapy students in Rijeka,"Abstract text Introduction: Vitamin D is a hormone of vital importance, and is primarily involved in regulation of Ca2+ concentration in plasma. In addition, its importance is emphasized in all organic systems, and its deficiency is characterized by various disorders in the body. Vitamin D is consumed with food, mostly fish, and its largest natural source is produced in the skin under the influence of UV sun rays. Its two most common forms are D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D2 is usually measured in plasma and its normal values range from 50 to 200 nmol /L. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between fish consummation and sun exposure with plasma vitamin D deficiency in physiotherapy students in Rijeka. Participants and methods: 29 physiotherapy students voluntarily approached to the study and signed informed consent. With permission from the Ethics Committee of Faculty of Health Studies blood was taken for the purpose of vitamin D analysis early in the fall. The analysis was carried out in the laboratory of Thalassotherapia Opatija. The students completed a questionnaire about their eating habits and sun exposure over past 4 weeks. The results were statistically analysed with the software program Statistica 13.3. For correlation of plasma vitamin D levels with mean sun exposure and fish consummation the Pearsonâ€™s test was used with statistical significance at P<0.05. Results: The data have shown significant positive correlation between plasma vitamin D level and sun exposure (r=0.414 ; P=0.03) and between plasma vitamin D level and fish consummation (r=0.413 ; P=0.04). Those students who were exposed to more sunlight and/or consumed more fish had higher levels of plasma vitamin D. Conclusion: The data point to importance of sun exposure and/or fish consummation in everyday life for sufficient plasma vitamin D level.",2018,
A Gradient-Based Optimization Algorithm for LASSO,"LASSO is a useful method for achieving both shrinkage and variable selection simultaneously. The main idea of LASSO is to use the L1 constraint in the regularization step which has been applied to various models such as wavelets, kernel machines, smoothing splines, and multiclass logistic models. We call such models with the L1 constraint generalized LASSO models. In this article, we propose a new algorithm called the gradient LASSO algorithm for generalized LASSO. The gradient LASSO algorithm is computationally more stable than QP-based algorithms because it does not require matrix inversions, and thus it can be more easily applied to high-dimensional data. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is fast enough for practical purposes and provides reliable results. To illustrate its computing power with high-dimensional data, we analyze multiclass microarray data using the proposed algorithm.",2008,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics

Towards Speculative Realism: Essays and Lectures,"These writings chart Harman's rise from Chicago sportswriter to co-founder of one of Europe's most promising philosophical movements: Speculative Realism. In 1997, Graham Harman was an obscure graduate student covering Chicago sporting events for a California website. Unpublished in philosophy at the time, he was already a popular conference speaker on Heidegger and related themes. Little more than a decade later, as the author of stimulating and highly visible books on continental philosophy, he was Associate Vice Provost for Research at the American University in Cairo, and a key member of the Speculative Realist movement along with Ray Brassier, Iain Hamilton Grant, and Quentin Meillassoux. This fascinating collection of eleven essays and lectures from 1997-2009, anchored by Harman's rebellious transformation of Heideggerian philosophy, show the evolution of his object-oriented metaphysics from its early days into an increasingly developed philosophical position. Each chapter is preceded by Harman's delightful and witty scene-setting commentary.",2010,
Dinoflagellate Cysts and Associated Aquatic Palynomorphs from the Tendaguru Beds (upper Jurassicâ€“lower Cretaceous) of Southeast Tanzania,"Abstract Dinoflagellate cysts and associated aquatic palynomorphs have been recovered from the dinosaur-bearing Tendaguru Beds (Upper Jurassicâ€“Lower Cretaceous) at Tendaguru, a hill in southeast Tanzania. Palynofloras from these beds are generally dominated by pollen grains of Mesozoic conifers (mainly Classopollis), but dinoflagellate cysts occur sporadically throughout the succession. They attain highest relative abundances and diversities in the marine intercalations between the Saurian Beds, namely in the Nerinea Bed (between the Lower and Middle Saurian Beds) and even more so in the Trigonia smeei Bed (between the Middle and Upper Saurian Beds). Peak levels of dinoflagellate cysts correspond to times when the shallow marine environments of the Nerinea and Trigonia smeei Beds had access to the open sea, while scarcity or absence of dinoflagellate cysts in the Saurian Beds is related to intervals of restricted access to the sea in tidal flat and coastal plain environments. Four informal dinoflagellate cyst assemblages can be distinguished in the Tendaguru Beds: the Rigaudella aemula-Chlamydophorella wallala assemblage from the Nerinea Bed (Oxfordian to Kimmeridgian); the Endoscrinium attadalense-Ctenidodinium sellwoodii group assemblage from the Middle Saurian Bed (late Kimmeridgian); the Dingodinium jurassicum-Kilwacysta assemblage from the Trigonia smeei Bed (Tithonian); the Muderongia-Oligosphaeridium assemblage probably from the Trigonia schwarzi Bed at Namunda Plateau, 8 km south of Tendaguru (late Valanginian to Hauterivian). The age determinations are based on correlation with known dinoflagellate cyst ranges and zonations in Australia, Europe and elsewhere. However, the stratigraphic position and previous biostratigraphic interpretations of the Tendaguru Beds based on ammonites, charophytes and ostracods were also taken into consideration. One new genus (Kilwacysta), three new species (Kilwacysta multiramosa, Kilwacysta semiseptata and Protobatioladinium lindiensis) and the new combination Barbatacysta capitata are proposed.",2005,
"Exploring Spatial Trends and Influencing Factors for Gastric Cancer Based on Bayesian Statistics: A Case Study of Shanxi, China","Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. To detect the spatial trends of GC risk based on hospital-diagnosed patients, this study presented a selection probability model and integrated it into the Bayesian spatial statistical model. Then, the spatial pattern of GC risk in Shanxi Province in north central China was estimated. In addition, factors influencing GC were investigated mainly using the Bayesian Lasso model. The spatial variability of GC risk in Shanxi has the conspicuous feature of being 'high in the south and low in the north'. The highest GC relative risk was 1.291 (95% highest posterior density: 0.789â»4.002). The univariable analysis and Bayesian Lasso regression results showed that a diverse dietary structure and increased consumption of beef and cow milk were significantly (p â‰¤ 0.08) and in high probability (greater than 68%) negatively associated with GC risk. Pork production per capita has a positive correlation with GC risk. Moreover, four geographic factors, namely, temperature, terrain, vegetation cover, and precipitation, showed significant (p < 0.05) associations with GC risk based on univariable analysis, and associated with GC risks in high probability (greater than 60%) inferred from Bayesian Lasso regression model.",2018,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
Quantifying the Relationship between Adaptive Traits and Agro-climatic Conditions,"Background & Aim: Durum wheat is an economically important and regularly eaten food forÂ  billions of people in the world. In the International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), genbanks are using Focused Identification of the Germplasm Strategy (FIGS) to find out and quantify relationships between agro-climatic conditions and the presence of specific traits. Hence, the study is aimed to investigate the predictive value of various types of long-term agro-climatic variables on the future values of different traits. 
Method: Ordinary multiple linear regression with stepwise variable selection method on the complete data set, and multiple linear regression models with predictors selected by penalized methods with mean square error cross-validation as a model selection criterion, are used to analyze 238 durum wheat landraces. Each of the models are fitted on Days to Heading and Days to Maturity response variables with 57 predictor variables, independently. Ordinary least square and weighted least square estimation methods were used. 
Result: Findings implied that there is high multicollinearity among the predictor variables. It is found that there are some predictors which affect positively and some others affect negatively for both Days to Heading and Days to Maturity using both ordinary and shrinkage based models. It is revealed that the prediction from the lasso based model is not that much reasonable. Furthermore, for the Days to Heading showed that there seems better prediction as their predicted value increase continuously as a function of the actual values though there is considerable variability. 
Conclusion: In conclusion, inferences and predictions by the ordinary MLR models are not trusted due to the presence of multicollinearity, and violation of some model assumptions. However, predictions using the models with predictors selected by the shrinkage methods may be better as the effects of the variability on these methods are minimal. Moreover, the WLS methods might give more sensible predictions than the OLS estimation methods. Better predictions were found on the Days to Heading.",2020,
Chaotic Contingency and the Obsessional Subject,"This paper examines the place of Chaos in what Quentin Meillassoux suggests is the â€˜necessity of contingencyâ€™, the critical reception of this reading of Chaos by Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek, and the obsessional mode of logos facilitated by such a reading. Rather than merely repeat the insights of Meillassoux and Å½iÅ¾ek, the discussion will push toward some critical comments on the status of the philosophical subject supposed by Å½iÅ¾ekâ€™s critique of Meillassoux and the analysis of logos more broadly when grounded upon the primordial contingent act of the withdrawal from Chaos reinterpreted by Å½iÅ¾ek as Nothing. Drawing on Å½iÅ¾ekâ€™s readings of Hegel and Schelling, it will be shown how the â€˜tarrying with the contingentâ€™ engaged in by both Meillassoux and Å½iÅ¾ek opens the subject of such a philosophical analysis to an obsessive terrain of contingencyâ€™s maddening infinite demand: to not stop not being.",2011,
Variable Selection via Biased Estimators in the Linear Regression Model,"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) is used for variable selection as well as for handling the multicollinearity problem simultaneously in the linear regression model. LASSO produces estimates having high variance if the number of predictors is higher than the number of observations and if high multicollinearity exists among the predictor variables. To handle this problem, Elastic Net (ENet) estimator was introduced by combining LASSO and Ridge estimator (RE). The solutions of LASSO and ENet have been obtained using Least Angle Regression (LARS) and LARS-EN algorithms, respectively. In this article, we proposed an alternative algorithm to overcome the issues in LASSO that can be combined LASSO with other exiting biased estimators namely Almost Unbiased Ridge Estimator (AURE), Liu Estimator (LE), Almost Unbiased Liu Estimator (AULE), Principal Component Regression Estimator (PCRE), r-k class estimator and r-d class estimator. Further, we examine the performance of the proposed algorithm using a Monte-Carlo simulation study and real-world examples. The results showed that the LARS-rk and LARS-rd algorithms,Â which are combined LASSO with r-k class estimator and r-d class estimator,Â outperformed other algorithms under the moderated and severe multicollinearity.",2020,Open Journal of Statistics
A comparison of multivariate methods for thedetection of Differential Item Functioning,"This thesis focuses on the comparison of three, recently developed, methods for the detection of differential item functioning (DIF) in the measurement of latent traits, such as abilities or attitudes in psychological or educational research. Identifying group differences is crucial for the correct and unbiased assessment of questionnaires. Over time, various methods have been proposed in literature to identify test items where DIF is present, which range from test statistics to modeling approaches. Most of these methods have some drawbacks in terms of usability or underlying assumptions, e.g. that they cannot deal with multi-categorical variables or that they focus on the global test level and do not identify DIF on the item level. The methods presented in this thesis, however, represent an advancement in the sense, that they try to overcome these problems and limitations. A commonality of the methods, that are described in the following, is, that they can cope with both multiple, potentially DIF-inducing, variables and any form of predictor variables, either metric or categorical. The advantage is a flexible and less restricted approach for the detection of DIF. The first considered method is called DIFlasso and is based on an extension of the widelyknown Rasch model, that involves additional group-specific parameters to incorporate group differences. DIF-detection is performed using a penalized estimation approach. The second method, DIFboost, uses boosting techniques to determine additional group-specific parameters in the extended Rasch model by means of iterative updating of so-called base learners. The third approach called DIFtree relies on model based recursive partitioning resulting in a decision tree for every item that carries out DIF. The aim of this thesis is to compare the three methods regarding their methodological approaches and by means of both an extensive simulation study and an applied example.",2017,
Monte Carlo Analysis of Security Protocols: Needham-Schroeder Revisitedâˆ—,"We apply Monte Carlo model checking to the Needham-Schroeder public key authentication protocol. The Monte Carlo approach uses random sampling of â€œlassosâ€ (reachable cycles) to compute an estimate of the weighted expectation that a system S satisfies an LTL formula Ï† within a factor of 1 Â± with probability at least 1âˆ’ Î´. It does so using a number of samples N that is optimal to within a constant factor, and in expected time O(N Â· D) and expected space O(D), where D is the recurrence diameter of the directed graph representing the product of Sâ€™s state transition graph and the Buchi automaton for Â¬Ï†. Our results indicate that Monte Carlo model checking can find attacks in security protocols like Needham-Schroeder when traditional model checkers fail due to state explosion; and that the weighted expectation that Needham-Schroder is attack-free increases linearly with the nonce range (number of rounds).",2005,
Iatrogenic Anterior Papillary Muscle Rupture,"Iatrogenic injury to the mitral valve or subvalvular apparatus is an uncommon, but severe complication. We present the case of a 40-year-old man with permanent atrial fibrillation accepted for circumferential ablation of the four pulmonary veins with the CARTO system. During the procedure, the Lasoo deflectable catheter (Lasso Nav, Biosense Webster) was trapped in the mitral subvalvular apparatus. Several maneuvers performed to free the device were ultimately successful, and the procedure was terminated satisfactorily. Nonetheless, the control echocardiography showed severe mitral regurgitation of the posterior leaflet, secondary to rupture of the anterior papillary muscle, warranting urgent surgery. A medial sternotomy and left atriotomy were carried out, and the mitral valve was repaired by annuloplasty and implantation of four polytetrafluoroethylene neochords in the posterior leaflet, with a good final outcome. In Figures 1 and 2, the intense abrasion (*) and damage resulting from the maneuvers to free the device are evident, as well as the sectioned papillary muscle (arrows). In a recent registry of 8745 patients undergoing ablation for atrial fibrillation, only 1 case of valve injury (without specifying the type) was recorded (Cappato et al., 2005). In a retrospective review of 348 patients, however, a significantly higher incidence (0.9%) was reported (Kesek et al., 2007). Most of these patients require a surgical intervention to extract the device or repair the mitral valve. Figure 1. Figure 2.",2013,Revista Espanola De Cardiologia
A two-stage minimax concave penalty based method in pruned AdaBoost ensemble,"Abstract AdaBoost is a highly effective ensemble learning method that combines several weak learners to produce a strong committee with higher accuracy. However, similar to other ensemble methods, AdaBoost uses a large number of base learners to produce the final outcome while addressing high-dimensional data. Thus, it poses a critical challenge in the form of high memory-space consumption. Feature selection methods can significantly reduce dimensionality in regression and have been established to be applicable in ensemble pruning. By pruning the ensemble, it is possible to generate a simpler ensemble with fewer base learners but a higher accuracy. In this article, we propose the minimax concave penalty (MCP) function to prune an AdaBoost ensemble to simplify the model and improve its accuracy simultaneously. The MCP penalty function is compared with LASSO and SCAD in terms of performance in pruning the ensemble. Experiments performed on real datasets demonstrate that MCP-pruning outperforms the other two methods. It can reduce the ensemble size effectively, and generate marginally more accurate predictions than the unpruned AdaBoost model.",2019,Appl. Soft Comput.

A Bayesian Framework for Robust Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping and Outlier Detection.,"We introduce a Bayesian framework for simultaneous feature selection and outlier detection in sparse high-dimensional regression models, with a focus on quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in experimental crosses. More specifically, we incorporate the robust mean shift outlier handling mechanism into the multiple QTL mapping regression model and apply LASSO regularization concurrently to the genetic effects and the mean-shift terms through the flexible extended Bayesian LASSO (EBL) prior structure, thereby combining QTL mapping and outlier detection into a single sparse model representation problem. The EBL priors on the mean-shift terms prevent outlying phenotypic values from distorting the genotype-phenotype association and allows their detection as cases with outstanding mean shift values following the LASSO shrinkage. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new methodology at mapping QTLs in the presence of outlying phenotypic values and simultaneously identifying the potential outliers, while maintaining a comparable performance to the standard EBL on outlier-free data.",2020,The international journal of biostatistics
Stinging Tight Junctions With WASPs,"xtracellular bacterial pathogens can hijack the EN-WASPâ€“based machinery to promote actin nucleation and polymerization in their hosts. One well-studied example is the family of attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens, which includes the human diarrheagenic enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E coli, and the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. These bacteria, which infect the intestinal epithelium, activate a syringe-like machinery, termed the type III secretion system, through which they translocate a battery of protein effectors from their own cytoplasm into the infected host. These protein effectors hijack diverse host processes, and are thought to contribute to EPEC pathogenesis. One such effector is E coli secreted protein F (EspF), a multifunctional protein that interacts via its proline-rich regions with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of N-WASP and another host protein, Sorting nexin-9 (SNX9), which mediates endocytic membrane remodeling. In addition, EspF is involved in the disruption of epithelial tight junctions, a process that may contribute to diarrhea. However, the role of these EspF interacting proteins in tight junction breakdown remains largely unknown. In this issue, Garber et al report the results of experiments designed to test the hypothesis that interactions between EspF and N-WASP/SNX9 are involved in the disruption of tight junctions. To this end, they generated a conditional knockout of the N-WASP gene in the mouse intestine. They also used an in vitro model of polarized human intestinal Caco-2 cells whose N-WASP expression was knocked down by short hairpin RNA. First, Garber et al showed that N-WASP expression is involved in maintaining apical junctional complex morphology and intestinal permeability. Calcium-switch experiments showed that N-WASP regulates the tight-junction barrier by modulating junctional protein dynamics. These data, which principally agree with previous in vivo studies in Drosophila, suggest that N-WASP may regulate the organization and function of epithelial cellâ€“cell junctions. Subsequently, using the experimental systems described earlier, they have been able to show the significance of N-WASP and SNX9 binding to EspF in the disruption of tight junction barrier functions. Strikingly, they also observed that infection with wild-type C rodentium induced a robust A/E phenotype in the wildtype mice, but not in the N-WASPâ€“deficient mice. Together, these findings suggest novel roles for N-WASP in maintaining the tight junctions homeostasis and host colonization by A/E pathogens. Despite this advance, it is not clear yet how EspF subverts the host junctions. EspF shares common characteristics with another protein effector, mitochondrialassociated protein (Map). For instance, both effectors",2018,Cellular and Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology
Method of Divide-and-Combine in Regularised Generalised Linear Models for Big Data,"When a data set is too big to be analysed entirely once by a single computer, the strategy of divide-and-combine has been the method of choice to overcome the computational hurdle due to its scalability. Although random data partition has been widely adopted, there is lack of clear theoretical justification and practical guidelines to combine results obtained from separate analysis of individual sub-datasets, especially when a regularisation method such as lasso is utilised for variable selection to improve numerical stability. In this paper we develop a new strategy to combine separate lasso-type estimates of regression parameters by the means of the confidence distributions based on bias-corrected estimators. We first establish the approach to the construction of the confidence distribution and then show that the resulting combined estimator enjoys the Fisher's efficiency in the sense of the estimation efficiency achieved by the maximum likelihood estimator from the analysis of full data. Furthermore, using the combined regularised estimator we propose an inference procedure. Extensive simulation studies are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology with comparisons to the classical meta estimation method and a voting-based variable selection method.",2016,arXiv: Methodology
Overview of Online Learning Algorithms for Large Data Analysis,"We have entered the era of big data in modern and contemporary times, and after entering the era of big data, more and more fields have to deal with massive and high-speed data in real time. How to extract these large data streams and effectively transform them into practical information is very important for all walks of life. The traditional batch machine learning technology, which we are familiar with, has many restrictive factors in the application and analysis of large data in the contemporary era, while the current online learning technology adopts the streaming computing mode. Its main advantage is that the real-time analysis and calculation of data can be carried out directly in memory, so as to achieve the streaming mode. Data learning provides advantageous methods and tools, and it also introduces the background and motivation of big data analysis. It shows the latest and classical online learning algorithms and methods. Therefore, this latest online learning system is very likely and hopeful to solve all kinds of big data mining tasks. Challenges, the main technology and content include these aspects: first, linear model online learning; second, non-traditional online learning methods. All these methods give more detailed models or pseudo-codes as far as possible, so as to discuss a large number of machine learning for large data analysis. Key issues in use. 1. The Characteristics and Advantages of Streaming Data in All Aspects In recent years, with the rapid development of new information technologies, such as computers, social networks and Internet technology, it is good to promote the ever-increasing growth of a large number of data types in human society, thus further promoting the human society to enter the era of big data [1-2]. And what we often call big data owners One of the most important characteristics of the first kind of large batch data is to store and analyze the data first, and then to centralize the analysis and calculation of some static data stored. The most typical large batch data calculation is Hadoop, which is a distributed file system. Hadoop Distributed Filesystem (HDFS) is mainly responsible for the storage of static data, and then data analysis and value discovery through MapReduce. This is a very important part. However, with the emergence of large data in all walks of life, such as images, video data, Internet data and so on. A series of large data is increasing, which is more presented to you in a dynamic stream data form [3]. This is what we call the second stream data. Unlike the traditional large batch data we see, stream data has more obvious characteristics and advantages, such as disorder, infinity, real-time, volatility, and so on. Extremely prominent features. In the calculation of large data streams, there are sometimes minor drawbacks, that is, when the order of arrival of some data streams cannot be determined, it will also be impossible to store all data streams. Therefore, when some data streams are no longer stored, we can directly calculate the data in real time with the arrival of flowing data. And the first point. Comparing with the large data batch computing we mentioned, the current large data flow mode is not optimistic either. The results of calculation research and practical experience are relatively less than that required. In summary, how to analyze and calculate large data flow efficiently, timely and rapidly through the data analysis of innovative methods has become the current big data analysis technology. New challenges in the field of technology. 2. Online Learning Method for Large Data Analysis (1)Using the criterion function of perceptron: This method can prove that the mode weight of the 2019 6th International Conference on Machinery, Mechanics, Materials, and Computer Engineering (MMMCE 2019) Copyright Â© (2019) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/mmmce.2019.013 53 algorithm will change after a limited number of amendments, that is, to a solution vector w. Thus, the algorithm of perceptron is a process of reward and punishment, and this is the earliest online learning algorithm in machine learning, which can be said to be very important. It can also solve the linear separability problem. So we can say that the emergence of perceptrons will promote the development of machine learning, but this method also has the situation that when the sample is linear and inseparable, the perceptron algorithm will not converge, so we need to use 2.1 section of the core perceptron algorithm, such as the second order perceptron (sec). Ondorder perceptron [23] and confidence-weighted algorithm are two very effective methods. The first second-order perceptron is actually an extension of the perceptron's directness. The common method of prediction is to update the augmented matrix or the fixed-valued unit matrix. The most representative of this process is that the augmented matrix and the misdivided data are discharged side by side, so that the weight vectors are updated and replaced according to the perceptron. The most obvious feature of the second confidence weighting algorithm is to maintain the different confidence levels of each feature. When the weights are updated, the weights corresponding to the features with lower confidence will be updated faster. On the contrary, the weights corresponding to the features with higher confidence will be updated more slowly. Therefore, this model also introduces second-order information. (2)Online Active and Passive Algorithms: Since 2000, convex optimization model has become the main direction and purpose of machine learning research because it can proxy the global search for optimal solutions and is easy to implement. In online passive-active algorithm [7], this algorithm is a very typical one. Moreover, the core idea of online passive-active learning algorithm based on convex optimization model is based on a sample support vector machine, then the maximum spacing constraints between support vector machines can be transformed. When the plane spacing between new samples and formula (3) is less than 1, it can be generated. In a word, the principle of online passive-active algorithm updating is that when the error of new data is small or no error, the algorithm will be updated passively or not, and when the error of new data is large or there are errors, the algorithm will be active. Dynamic updating, i.e. projecting to the nearest neighbor of an existing classifier. (3)Common online sparse solution learning algorithms: Sparse learning algorithm is based on the rise of compressed sensing technology, and L1 norm minimal regularization and other two more important factors can be further concerned. One of the most basic principles is LASSO, which can learn the model in Form (2). The parameters are chosen as the characteristics. Moreover, when the L1 paradigm is minimized, its optimal value can only be obtained on the boundary (i.e. only on the boundary of the coordinate axis), so that the sparse solution can be obtained. Finally, when we train in batch, we usually use the whole training. The sparse solution can be obtained by the method, and the online sparse solution learning algorithm can be used. 3. Summary and Prospects In summary, in the modern and contemporary era of large data, online learning algorithm using streaming computing mode has great advantages, such as strong expansibility, high performance, flexibility and convenience, and small theoretical error range, etc. These obvious advantages, and it is in the field of dynamic data-oriented processing. It has been widely used, which makes it irreplaceable. This paper mainly shows us the latest and classical online learning methods, and gives the pseudo-codes and models of our common methods in detail as far as possible. At the same time, it also discusses the large-scale orientation. Some important and key problems in the application and research of large-scale machine learning in data analysis are comprehensively analyzed. We believe that the research methods of online learning algorithms in the era of big data include the following points: (1) Starting from the way of extracting research data streams; This paper mainly studies the organization methods and schemes of stream data, so as to improve the processing speed of stream data better; (2) reasonably and effectively put forward some novel online learning models to achieve a better online learning framework for deriving algorithms with high performance; (3) can propose a distributed stream-based online learning framework.

Variable selection in multivariate linear models with high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation,"In this paper, we propose a novel variable selection approach in the framework of multivariate linear models taking into account the dependence that may exist between the responses. It consists in estimating beforehand the covariance matrix of the responses and to plug this estimator in a Lasso criterion, in order to obtain a sparse estimator of the coefficient matrix. The properties of our approach are investigated both from a theoretical and a numerical point of view. More precisely, we give general conditions that the estimators of the covariance matrix and its inverse have to satisfy in order to recover the positions of the null and non null entries of the coefficient matrix when the size of the covariance matrix is not fixed and can tend to infinity. We prove that these conditions are satisfied in the particular case of some Toeplitz matrices. Our approach is implemented in the R package MultiVarSel available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and is very attractive since it benefits from a low computational load. We also assess the performance of our methodology using synthetic data and compare it with alternative approaches. Our numerical experiments show that including the estimation of the covariance matrix in the Lasso criterion dramatically improves the variable selection performance in many cases.",2018,J. Multivar.

Abnormal Emotional Processing and Emotional Experience in Patients with Peripheral Facial Nerve Paralysis: An MEG Study,"Abnormal emotional reactions of the brain in patients with facial nerve paralysis have not yet been reported. This study aims to investigate this issue by applying a machine-learning algorithm that discriminates brain emotional activities that belong either to patients with facial nerve paralysis or to healthy controls. Beyond this, we assess an emotion rating task to determine whether there are differences in their experience of emotions. MEG signals of 17 healthy controls and 16 patients with facial nerve paralysis were recorded in response to picture stimuli in three different emotional categories (pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral). The selected machine learning technique in this study was the logistic regression with LASSO regularization. We demonstrated significant classification performances in all three emotional categories. The best classification performance was achieved considering features based on event-related fields in response to the pleasant category, with an accuracy of 0.79 (95% CI (0.70, 0.82)). We also found that patients with facial nerve paralysis rated pleasant stimuli significantly more positively than healthy controls. Our results indicate that the inability to express facial expressions due to peripheral motor paralysis of the face might cause abnormal brain emotional processing and experience of particular emotions.",2020,Brain Sciences
Sparse High-Dimensional Regression: Exact Scalable Algorithms and Phase Transitions,"We present a novel binary convex reformulation of the sparse regression problem that constitutes a new duality perspective. We devise a new cutting plane method and provide evidence that it can solve to provable optimality the sparse regression problem for sample sizes n and number of regressors p in the 100,000s, that is two orders of magnitude better than the current state of the art, in seconds. The ability to solve the problem for very high dimensions allows us to observe new phase transition phenomena. Contrary to traditional complexity theory which suggests that the difficulty of a problem increases with problem size, the sparse regression problem has the property that as the number of samples $n$ increases the problem becomes easier in that the solution recovers 100% of the true signal, and our approach solves the problem extremely fast (in fact faster than Lasso), while for small number of samples n, our approach takes a larger amount of time to solve the problem, but importantly the optimal solution provides a statistically more relevant regressor. We argue that our exact sparse regression approach presents a superior alternative over heuristic methods available at present.",2017,arXiv: Optimization and Control
New Gibbs sampling methods for bayesian regularized quantile regression,"In this paper, we propose new Bayesian hierarchical representations of lasso, adaptive lasso and elastic net quantile regression models. We explore these representations by observing that the lasso penalty function corresponds to a scale mixture of truncated normal distribution (with exponential mixing densities). We consider fully Bayesian treatments that lead to new Gibbs sampler methods with tractable full conditional posteriors. The new methods are then illustrated with both simulated and real data. Results show that the new methods perform very well under a variety of simulations, such as the presence of a moderately large number of predictors, collinearity and heterogeneity.",2019,Computers in biology and medicine
Efficient block-coordinate descent algorithms for the Group Lasso,"We present two algorithms to solve the Group Lasso problem (Yuan and Lin in, J R Stat Soc Ser B (Stat Methodol) 68(1):49â€“67, 2006). First, we propose a general version of the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithm for the Group Lasso that employs an efficient approach for optimizing each subproblem exactly. We show that it exhibits excellent performance when the groups are of moderate size. For groups of large size, we propose an extension of ISTA/FISTA SIAM (Beck and Teboulle in, SIAM J Imag Sci 2(1):183â€“202, 2009) based on variable step-lengths that can be viewed as a simplified version of BCD. By combining the two approaches we obtain an implementation that is very competitive and often outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches for this problem. We show how these methods fit into the globally convergent general block coordinate gradient descent framework in Tseng and Yun (Math Program 117(1):387â€“423, 2009). We also show that the proposed approach is more efficient in practice than the one implemented in Tseng and Yun (Math Program 117(1):387â€“423, 2009). In addition, we apply our algorithms to the Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) recovery problem, which can be viewed as a special case of the Group Lasso problem, and compare their performance to other methods in this particular instance.",2013,Mathematical Programming Computation
Stalked Crinoids Collected off California with Descriptions of Three New Genera and Two New Species of Hyocrinidae (Echinodermata),"Abstract 
 Five species of stalked crinoids collected at depths from 1,693 to 4,135 m off the California coast, chiefly on seamounts, are described. Four were photographed in situ and collected during Monterey Bay Aquarium and Research Institute cruises using ROV Tiburon. Four specimens with intact crowns are attributed to Bathycrinus equatorialis A. H. Clark, 1908a, previously known from a single stalk with basal ring collected in the central eastern Pacific. Parahyocrinus claguei Roux, n. gen., n. sp., here described from a growth series of six specimens, is closely related to Hyocrinus biscoitoi Roux, 2004 (herein transferred to Parahyocrinus Roux, n. gen.), from the East Pacific Rise, but differs in features of the tegmen, pinnules, and stalk articulations. The single, finely ornamented specimen of Tiburonicrinus ornatus Roux, n. gen., n. sp., displays an original arrangement of characters suggesting affinities with Thalassocrinus alvinae from the Gorda Ridge. Gephyrocrinus messingi Roux & Lambert, 2011, known from off British Columbia and California, is transferred as type species to Lamberticrinus Roux, n. gen., after a reexamination of its pinnule architecture. Specimens of the fifth species, Bathycrinus complanatus A. H. Clark, 1908b, were trawled off California by R/V New Horizon.",2017,Pacific Science
Detecting common genomic mechanism between diseases using paired sparse canonical correlation analysis,"Human diseases of different etiologies, for example, different acute inflammatory diseases, often share common underlying molecular mechanism. Investigating this commonality will help us not only better understand the diseases but also identify new molecular targets for therapy. In our study, we make use of genomic profile data together with clinical information and propose a statistical approach to detect the common gene set that is reflective of the common mechanism in the multiple diseases. Our paired sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (psCCA), utilizes multiple clinical variables that measure different aspects of the disease severity or progress. Simultaneously assessing relationships between multiple clinical variables and genomic profiles for given diseases, psCCA provides the overall picture of the relationships, thus is a more adequate approach to explore multiple diseases than performing millions of individual tests. Using lasso penalty, psCCA identifies the sparse linear combination of genes that is highly correlated with the corresponding clinical variables. It maximizes the correlation within diseases and restricts the model such that the selected genes are common for all given diseases. Our simulation shows that psCCA is able to select a common gene set underlying clinical phenotype for multiple diseases. We also demonstrate this new method on data sets of burn and trauma patients.",2016,2016 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC)

Lung involvement at initial presentation in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm lacking cutaneous lesion,"Dear Editor, Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare disease independently categorized in association with acute myeloid leukemia or related precursor neoplasm by the WHO [1, 2]. It is symptomatically characterized by fever, skin rash, lymphadenopathy, cytopenias, and leukemic blasts. Here, we present a rare case of BPDCN with interstitial pneumonia at the initial presentation. An 82-year-old female presented with shortness of breath, fever, and neutropenia in the peripheral blood. Fine crackles were heard in all lung fields. There was no rash. Computed tomography (CT) showed interstitial shadows prominent in the lungs, notably in the lower lobes, with no lymph node swelling. The anti-nuclear antibody titer was 320 times that of a control. She was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia associated with autoimmune disease. After oral predonisolone, all symptoms alleviated promptly. Unfortunately, the tapering of predonisolone was followed by recurrence. Then, she was hospitalized in our university hospital. Peripheral blood analysis profiled pancytopenia (WBC count, 3.5Ã—10/l; Hb, 8.5 g/dl; and platelet count, 122Ã—10/l). Serum lactate dehydrogenase was slightly elevated (339 IU/l). Soluble interleukin-2 receptor was 1,664U/ml. Positron-emission tomographyâ€“CT (PETâ€“CT) demonstrated that the incorporation of F-fluorodeoxy glucose was elevated in her lungs (SUVmax, 5.6)(Fig. 1a), consistent with interstitial lesions of the bilateral lungs. Moreover, flow cytometric results of lung biopsy showed that cells infiltrating the lung specimen were positive for CD4, CD45RA, CD56, and CD38 and negative for CD3 and CD34 (Fig. 1b). Bone marrow aspirate showed hypercellularity of increased mediumto large-sized blasts (14.5 %) with irregular nuclei and nucleoli (Fig. 1c). These cells were negative for peroxidase. Flow cytometric analyses showed that blasts were phenotypically consistent with cells in the lung specimen (data not shown). Furthermore, blasts were positive for CD43, CD123 (dendritic cellassociated antigen [3]), as well as CD56 and CD4 (>90 %) in the bone marrow mononuclear cells (Fig. 1d). Karyotypic aberration and rearrangements of T cell receptor and immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes were not detected. We diagnosed the patient with BPDCN lacking cutaneous lesions with leukemic and interstitial lung presentation. Even though the patient received multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, blasts were not entirely controlled, and she died 3 months after the diagnosis. Rauh et al. reported 22 patients diagnosed with BPDCN, with skin lesions initially observed in 81 %, lymphadenopathy in 64 %, and bone marrow involvement in 96 % [1].

"A Republican dilemma: City or state? Or, the concrete revolution revisited","EnglishIn a well-known passage, the Greek historian Polybius, writing in the mid-second century BC, attributes Rome's success as a republic to a perfect balance of power between its constituent elements, army, senate and people (Histories 6.11); and indeed, the Republic's long survival was an achievement worth explaining. On another note, over a century later, Livy remarked how Republican Rome, with its rambling street plan and miscellany of buildings, compared unfavourably with the magnificent royal cities of the eastern Mediterranean; he put this down to hasty rebuilding after a great Gallic conflagration around 390 BC. Few scholars now accept his explanation. A handful of scholars argue for underlying rationales, usually when setting up the early city as a foil for its transformation under Augustus and subsequent emperors, and their conclusions tend towards characterizing the city's design as an unintended corollary to the annual turnover of magistrates. This article, likewise, argues for the role of government in the city's appearance; but it contends that the state of Republican urbanism was deliberate. A response, of sorts, to both ancient authors' observations, it addresses how provisions to ensure equilibrium in one of the Republic's components, the senatorial class, in the interests of preserving the res publica, came at a vital cost to the city's architectural evolution. These provisions took the form of intentional constraints (on time and money), to prevent elite Romans from building like, and thus presenting themselves as, Mediterranean monarchs. Painting with a broad chronological stroke, it traces the tension between the Roman Republic in its ideal state and the physical city, exploring the strategies elite Romans developed to work within the constraints. Only when unforeseen factors weakened the state's power to self-regulate could the built city flourish and, in doing so, further diminish the state. Many of these factors â€” such as increased wealth in the second century and the first-century preponderance of special commands â€” are known; to these, this article argues, should be added the development of concrete. italianoAttorno alla meta del II sec. a.C., lo storico greco Polibio attribuisce in un noto passo il successo di Roma come Repubblica al perfetto bilanciamento del potere tra i suoi elementi costitutivi: l'esercito, il senato e il popolo (Storie 6.11). Ed in effetti, la lunga durata della Repubblica era un risultato che andava spiegato. In un altro passo, successivo di oltre un secolo, Livio osserva invece come la Roma repubblicana con il suo assetto stradale incoerente e la sua mescolanza di edifici, uscisse sfavorita da un paragone con le magnifiche citta regali del Mediterraneo orientale. Lo storico riconduceva questa situazione alla frettolosa ricostruzione seguita all'incendio gallico del 390 a.C. Alcuni studiosi sostengono che in questo assetto siano da riconoscere scelte razionali, ponendo generalmente la citta piu antica come elemento di confronto con la sua â€˜trasformazioneâ€™ sotto il regno di Augusto e dei suoi successori. Le loro conclusioni tendono pertanto a caratterizzare la struttura della citta come una sorta di corollario non intenzionale del turnover annuale dei magistrati. Il presente articolo sostiene concorda nel sostenere la rilevanza del ruolo giocato dal governo nell'aspetto della citta; ma asserisce per contro come il tipo di urbanistica della Roma repubblicana fosse una scelta deliberata. Quasi a moâ€™ di risposta alle osservazioni di entrambi gli autori antichi, si mette in evidenza come i provvedimenti volti ad assicurare l'equilibrio di uno degli elementi costitutivi della Repubblica â€“ l'ordine senatorio â€“ nell'interesse della conservazione della res publica abbiano avuto come contropartita il tipo di evoluzione architettonica della citta. Nel dettaglio queste misure hanno preso la forma di vincoli intenzionali (in termini di tempo e di risorse economiche), per evitare che i membri dellâ€™elite potessero edificare come monarchi mediterranei, presentandosi conseguentemente come tali. L'adozione di questo approccio su di un ampio lasso cronologico mette in evidenza la tensione tra la Repubblica Romana nella sua concezione ideale e la citta reale, esplorando le strategie che lâ€™elite romana ha sviluppato per lavorare entro specifiche limitazioni. Ne consegue che solamente quando fattori imprevisti indebolirono il potere di auto-regolamentazione dello Stato, la citta pote fiorire dal punto di vista urbanistico/architettonico, sminuendo pero in questo modo lo Stato stesso. Molti di questi fattori sono noti. E il caso, ad esempio, dell'incremento della ricchezza nel II sec. a.C. e della prevalenza di special commission nel I sec. a.C. E in particolare a questi fenomeni, secondo la lettura proposta in questo articolo, dovrebbe essere attribuito lo sviluppo dell'opera cementizia.",2017,

Time-Varying Differential Network Analysis for Revealing Network Rewiring over Cancer Progression.,"To reveal how gene regulatory networks change over cancer development, multiple time-varying differential networks between adjacent cancer stages should be estimated simultaneously. Since the network rewiring may be driven by the perturbation of certain individual genes, there may be some hub nodes shared by these differential networks. Although several methods have been developed to estimate differential networks from gene expression data, most of them are designed for estimating a single differential network, which neglect the similarities between different differential networks. In this study, we propose a new Gaussian graphical model-based method to jointly estimate multiple time-varying differential networks for identifying network rewiring over cancer development. A D-trace loss is used to determine the differential networks. A tree-structured group Lasso penalty is designed to identify the common hub nodes shared by different differential networks and the specific hub nodes unique to individual differential networks. Simulation experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. We also apply our method to The Cancer Genome Atlas data to explore gene network rewiring over different breast cancer stages. Hub nodes in the estimated differential networks rediscover well known genes associated with the development and progression of breast cancer.",2019,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics
Data mining-based detection of rapid growth in length of stay on COPD patients,"Background: Due to the rapid development in industrialization and urbanization, air pollution has aggravated in the past few years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has become the world's fourth leading cause of death. Through the study of factors affecting medical cost, we find that there is a strong correlation between medical cost and length of stay (LOS). Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and predict the LOS for patients with COPD. Objective: To identify COPD patients with rapidly increased LOS next year by the method of data mining. Methods: Based on the data from healthcare survey data in one city of China, we extracted the 36985 patients with COPD who had been admitted to hospital, from January 2011 to December 2012. On the basis of LASSO Logistic regression and random forests (RF), we established the prediction models. Results: The precision and accuracy of the method was proved correct and reliable (the AUC of LASSO: 0.62, the AUC of RF: 0.63) when employing 29 factors. Conclusion: This study provides an accurate and applicable method to detection the potential patients who are most likely to rapid growth in LOS.",2017,2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Big Data Analysis (ICBDA)(

"Toxicity of Foroozan crude oil to ornate wrasse (Thalassoma pavo, Osteichthyes, Labridae): ultrastructure and cellular biomarkers","Abstract The present study was conducted to assess the toxicity of Foroozan (Iranian crude oil) on the ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo (Labridae) using three sub-lethal crude oil concentrations. Gills, selected as target organ being the major route of hydrocarbon uptake, were excised after 48, 96 and 192 hours and analyzed by light and both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Cellular biomarkers of exposure and/or effect were measured in branchial tissues of T. pavo, and severe lesions such as necrosis, aneurysms and disorganization of the lamellae proportional to the Foroozan exposure periods and concentrations were observed. The main alteration was on the lamellar epithelium, which displayed an irregular profile characterized by pavement cell cytoplasmic protrusion and an alteration of the oxygen chemosensing cells, resulting in impairment of various biological activities. Nevertheless, the ability of specimens to regulate calcium homeostasis and neurotransmission, as well as balance cell turnover, suggests that the species tested to not only survive but also recover in such high crude oil dosage regimen. The identification in gills of histological and neurological changes associated with acute crude oil exposure confirms the utility of the sub-lethal toxicity tests.",2012,Italian Journal of Zoology
Machine learning on density and elastic property of oxide glasses driven by large dataset,"Abstract We conduct a comprehensive machine learning study on predicting the oxide glasses density, Young's modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio given compositions, by leveraging the large dataset collected at Corning Incorporated. The density and elastic property datasets have the size of 24,858 and 8519, respectively. Our results show that random forest, K-Nearest neighbor, and neural networks consistently deliver good performance, while support vector machine consistently underperforms. Lasso linear regression works best for density prediction, while Poisson's ratio is extremely challenging to predict with the best R2 score achieved to be around 0.7 by random forest. Additionally, feature importance analysis shows that La2O3 and BaO are the top two features for density prediction, while Na2O and B2O3 for Young's modulus and shear modulus prediction, and CaO and SiO2 for Poisson's ratio prediction. The study could be potentially leveraged as the baseline by future studies given the large dataset we trained on.",2020,Journal of Non-crystalline Solids

To Integrate is to Survive: Urban Agricultural Practices in Three Southern Towns,"""Urban agriculture is extensively established in cities of southern countries. Though often absent from land planning policies, it manages to exist and adapt to urban constraints. The integration of agriculture into urban life has often been studied from a political, economic or environmental angle. We focus on studying this integration in socio-spatial terms and three examples are developed here in order to highlight different integration modes that result from urban farmersâ€™ practices: in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso), farmers establish social relationships to ensure their access to productive resources; in Metro Manila (Philippines) the appropriation of practices and networks of actors at the local level is a guarantee for sustainability; and in Saint-Louis (Senegal), it is through forms of organization initiated by farmers that they are able to assert their interests with urban authorities.""",2014,
Effect of storage time and temperature on nutritional and bacteriological quality of collected raw milk in Burkina Faso,"The objective of this study conducted from july to october 2013 in Bobo-Dioulasso,Burkina Faso was to evaluate if these collected milk can be stored for a determined time at the state believed without deteriorating. 
Three hundred samples divided into 600 aliquots of 30 mL of raw milk were analysed after storage at room temperature and in the refrigerator at +4 Â°C. Milk composition was determined using infrared (FMA, Miris AB, Sweden, 2001). The bacteriological analysis focused on Lactobacilli, Coliforms, Staphylococcus and Psychrotropic. The data were subjected to the analysis of the variants (software SPPS 18 version). Means were compared by Newman- keuls test for p < 0, 05. 
The results showed variation of the nutritional value of raw milk after 24 h at room temperature compared to immediately analysed. The Lactobacillis, Coliforms and Psychrotropic have not significantly changed during the period. On the other hand, the rate of Lactobacillis increased after 48 h at room contrasting with a decline in the rate of Escherichia coli package. When the retention time exceeded 120 h at +4 Â°C, there was a significant decrease in the nutritional value of milk. Different bacteria rate has not significantly varied between 24 and 168 h +4 Â°C conservation explaining a direct action of the storage on these milk temperature. Thus, milk collected in Bobo-Dioulasso can be stored at +4 Â°C in the refrigerator for 07 days without deterioration of nutritional value if the initial bacterial load does not exceed 103 cfu/mL.",2017,International journal of innovation and scientific research

This research was conducted at SMKN 2 Karawang. The phenomenon happened in this researchâ€™s object is the low of student learning outcomes. Learning outcomes are the results obtained through the learning process in schools that expressed in value. Generally, the factors that can influence student learning outcomes are divided into two groups, namely factors derived from the students themselves (internal factors) and factors derived from outside of the students (external factors). The factors that caused the problem in this research is the external factors, especially learning strategies. Based on this phenomenon, the author proposed a research titled ""The Effect of Peer Tutor Learning Strategies Implementation on Learning Outcomes (Experimental Study of Class XI Accounting Students at SMK 2 Karawang for The School Year of 2012-2013 in Special Journal Lessons)"". This research used an experimental methods with Posttest-Only Control Design, which is preceded by conducting experiments in the classroom, collecting data with the initial test and giving post-test that then compiled, described and analyzed using statistical calculations.

Avoiding Communication in Proximal Methods for Convex Optimization Problems,"The fast iterative soft thresholding algorithm (FISTA) is used to solve convex regularized optimization problems in machine learning. Distributed implementations of the algorithm have become popular since they enable the analysis of large datasets. However, existing formulations of FISTA communicate data at every iteration which reduces its performance on modern distributed architectures. The communication costs of FISTA, including bandwidth and latency costs, is closely tied to the mathematical formulation of the algorithm. This work reformulates FISTA to communicate data at every k iterations and reduce data communication when operating on large data sets. We formulate the algorithm for two different optimization methods on the Lasso problem and show that the latency cost is reduced by a factor of k while bandwidth and floating-point operation costs remain the same. The convergence rates and stability properties of the reformulated algorithms are similar to the standard formulations. The performance of communication-avoiding FISTA and Proximal Newton methods is evaluated on 1 to 1024 nodes for multiple benchmarks and demonstrate average speedups of 3-10x with scaling properties that outperform the classical algorithms.",2017,ArXiv
Efficient Prioritization of Multiple Causal eQTL Variants via Sparse Polygenic Modeling.,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies have typically used single-variant association analysis to identify genetic variants correlated with gene expression. However, this approach has several drawbacks: causal variants cannot be distinguished from nonfunctional variants in strong linkage disequilibrium, combined effects from multiple causal variants cannot be captured, and low-frequency (<5% MAF) eQTL variants are difficult to identify. While these issues possibly could be overcome by using sparse polygenic models, which associate multiple genetic variants with gene expression simultaneously, the predictive performance of these models for eQTL studies has not been evaluated. Here, we assessed the ability of three sparse polygenic models (Lasso, Elastic Net, and BSLMM) to identify causal variants, and compared their efficacy to single-variant association analysis and a fine-mapping model. Using simulated data, we determined that, while these methods performed similarly when there was one causal SNP present at a gene, BSLMM substantially outperformed single-variant association analysis for prioritizing causal eQTL variants when multiple causal eQTL variants were present (1.6- to 5.2-fold higher recall at 20% precision), and identified up to 2.3-fold more low frequency variants as the top eQTL SNP. Analysis of real RNA-seq and whole-genome sequencing data of 131 iPSC samples showed that the eQTL SNPs identified by BSLMM had a higher functional enrichment in DHS sites and were more often low-frequency than those identified with single-variant association analysis. Our study showed that BSLMM is a more effective approach than single-variant association analysis for prioritizing multiple causal eQTL variants at a single gene.",2017,Genetics
Guaranteed bounds for L1-recovery,"We propose new methods of recovery of sparse signals from noisy observation based on L1-minimization. They are closely related to the well-known techniques such as Lasso and Dantzig Selector. However, these estimators come with {\em efficiently verifiable guaranties of performance}. By optimizing these bounds with respect to the method parameters we are able to construct the estimators which possess better statistical properties than the commonly used ones. We also provide an oracle inequality to justify the proposed algorithms and show how the estimates can be computed using the Basis Pursuit algorithm.",2010,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Participation rates of in-class vs. online administration of low-stakes research-based assessments,"This study investigates differences in student participation rates between in-class and online administrations of research-based assessments. A sample of 1,310 students from 25 sections of 3 different introductory physics courses over two semesters were instructed to complete the CLASS attitudinal survey and the concept inventory relevant to their course, either the FCI or the CSEM. Each student was randomly assigned to take one of the surveys in class and the other survey online at home using the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes (LASSO) platform. Results indicate large variations in participation rates across both test conditions (online and in class). A hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM) of the student data utilizing logistic regression indicates that student grades in the course and faculty assessment administration practices were both significant predictors of student participation. When the recommended online assessments administration practices were implemented, participation rates were similar across test conditions. Implications for student and course assessment methodologies will be discussed.",2017,arXiv: Physics Education

Elastic-Net Copula Granger Causality for Inference of Biological Networks,"AIM
In bioinformatics, the inference of biological networks is one of the most active research areas. It involves decoding various complex biological networks that are responsible for performing diverse functions in human body. Among these networks analysis, most of the research focus is towards understanding effective brain connectivity and gene networks in order to cure and prevent related diseases like Alzheimer and cancer respectively. However, with recent advances in data procurement technology, such as DNA microarray analysis and fMRI that can simultaneously process a large amount of data, it yields high-dimensional data sets. These high dimensional dataset analyses possess challenges for the analyst.


BACKGROUND
Traditional methods of Granger causality inference use ordinary least-squares methods for structure estimation, which confront dimensionality issues when applied to high-dimensional data. Apart from dimensionality issues, most existing methods were designed to capture only the linear inferences from time series data.


METHOD AND CONCLUSION
In this paper, we address the issues involved in assessing Granger causality for both linear and nonlinear high-dimensional data by proposing an elegant form of the existing LASSO-based method that we call ""Elastic-Net Copula Granger causality"". This method provides a more stable way to infer biological networks which has been verified using rigorous experimentation. We have compared the proposed method with the existing method and demonstrated that this new strategy outperforms the existing method on all measures: precision, false detection rate, recall, and F1 score. We have also applied both methods to real HeLa cell data and StarPlus fMRI datasets and presented a comparison of the effectiveness of both methods.",2016,PLoS ONE
Development of Three Practical Indices for Mucosal Healing Among Patients With Moderate to Severe CrohnÊ¼s Disease: P-59,"BACKGROUND: Deep remission (DR), defined as clinical remission and mucosal healing (MH), has been associated with improved patient outcomes.Evidence of DR beyond 1 year has not been characterized. We aimed to evaluate the impact of adalimumab (ADA) on DR over a 3-year period. METHODS: We analyzed the intention-to-treat (ITT) population from CHARM (56 weeks, randomized at Week 4 to placebo [PBO], ADA 40 mg every other week [eow], and ADA 40 mg weekly) and its 2-year open label extension ADHERE (all patients given open-label ADA 40 mg eow or weekly). Due to the absence of endoscopic measurements in CHARM and ADHERE, a practical index obtained from a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) procedure was used to predict MH (defined as a CD Endoscopic Index of Severity [CDEIS] score 4.24). DR was defined as a Crohnâ€™s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score <150 plus predicted MH. Patients who discontinued, had missing data, or switched to open-label therapy during CHARM were classified as DR nonresponders at subsequent time points. Rates of DR (assessed at Weeks 26 and 56) were compared between the ADA and PBO arms using chi-square tests. The rates of DR are also assessed in the open-label extension ADHERE (up to Week 164). RESULTS: Of 517 patients randomized to ADA in CHARM, 318 (62%) entered ADHERE. DR rates at Weeks 26 and 56 were significantly higher for the ADA eow and ADA weekly arms compared with PBO. Rates of DR on open-label ADA were maintained up to Week 164 during ADHERE (figure). CONCLUSION(S): DR was achieved by a substantial proportion of patients in CHARM. Rates of DR achievement were sustained over 3 years. Reference.Oral presentation OP317. UEGW 2010, Barcelona, Spain, October 23-27. P-59",2012,Inflammatory Bowel Diseases

GWAS-based Machine Learning for Prediction of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Risk,"Numerous independent susceptibility variants have been identified for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Since advanced AMD is currently incurable, an accurate prediction of a person9s AMD risk using genetic information is desirable for early diagnosis and clinical management. In this study, genotype data of 32,215 Caucasian individuals with age above 50 years from the International AMD Genomics Consortium in dbGAP were used to establish and validate prediction models for AMD risk using four different machine learning approaches: neural network, lasso regression, support vector machine, and random forest. A standard logistic regression model was also considered using a genetic risk score. To identify feature SNPs for AMD prediction models, we selected the genome-wide significant SNPs from GWAS. All methods achieved good performance for predicting normal controls versus advanced AMD cases (AUC=0.81~0.82 in a separate test dataset) and normal controls versus any AMD (AUC=0.78~0.79). By applying the state-of-art machine learning approaches on the large AMD GWAS data, the predictive models we established can provide an accurate estimation of an individual9s AMD risk profile across the person9s lifespan based on a comprehensive genetic information.",2019,medRxiv
Kernel Basis Pursuit,"Estimating a non-uniformly sampled function from a set of learning points is a classical regression problem. Kernel methods have been widely used in this context, but every problem leads to two major tasks: optimizing the kernel and setting the fitness-regularization compromise. This article presents a new method to estimate a function from noisy learning points in the context of RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space). We introduce the Kernel Basis Pursuit algorithm, which enables us to build a L 1 -regularized-multiple-kernel estimator. The general idea is to decompose the function to learn on a sparse-optimal set of spanning functions. Our implementation relies on the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) formulation and on the Least Angle Regression Stepwise (LARS) solver. The computation ofthe full regularization path, through the LARS, will enable us to propose new adaptive criteria to find an optimal fitness-regularization compromise. Finally, we aim at proposing a fast parameter-free method to estimate non-uniform-sampled functions.",2005,
A novel variational Bayes multiple locus Z-statistic for genome-wide association studies with Bayesian model averaging,"MOTIVATION
For many complex traits, including height, the majority of variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have small effects, leaving a significant proportion of the heritable variation unexplained. Although many penalized multiple regression methodologies have been proposed to increase the power to detect associations for complex genetic architectures, they generally lack mechanisms for false-positive control and diagnostics for model over-fitting. Our methodology is the first penalized multiple regression approach that explicitly controls Type I error rates and provide model over-fitting diagnostics through a novel normally distributed statistic defined for every marker within the GWAS, based on results from a variational Bayes spike regression algorithm.


RESULTS
We compare the performance of our method to the lasso and single marker analysis on simulated data and demonstrate that our approach has superior performance in terms of power and Type I error control. In addition, using the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) GWAS of African-Americans, we show that our method has power to detect additional novel associations with body height. These findings replicate by reaching a stringent cutoff of marginal association in a larger cohort.

Development of a Brief Version of the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM): The COMM-9,"Objective
The Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) is a commonly used self-report instrument to identify and monitor aberrant opioid-related behavior in chronic pain patients on opioid therapy. However, the length of the COMM may limit its clinical utility. Additionally, this paper-and-pencil screener requires hand scoring, which increases paperwork and staff burden. Therefore, the current study presents development of the ""COMM-9,"" a brief electronically administered form of the COMM.


Methods
Patients (Nâ€‰=â€‰517) with chronic noncancer pain on opioid therapy completed the COMM. Patients were classified as either being positive or negative for aberrant drug-related behavior based on self-report data from a structured interview, physician-report data, and urine toxicology screen (the Aberrant Drug Behavior Index [ADBI]). COMM items with the strongest classification accuracy were identified using the LASSO method as the selection criterion in conjunction with the leave-one-out cross-validation method as the stop criterion. A sub-set of patients (n=55) completed a second administration of the COMM one week later to evaluate test-retest reliability.


Results
Nine items were identified before the selection criterion stopped, and logistic regression was utilized to predict probabilities of positive ADBI from the 9 COMM items using all data and the cross-validation procedure. Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed high levels of classification accuracy that were essentially equivalent to the full COMM. Cut-points were identified to classify patients as having no/low risk, moderate risk, and high risk for aberrant opioid-related behavior. Test-retest reliability of the COMM-9 was comparable to the full 17-item COMM.


Conclusions
This study presents the successful development of a brief electronic screener to identify current aberrant opioid-related behavior in chronic pain patients on long-term opioid therapy.",2019,Pain Medicine
UtilitÃ  dellâ€™introduzione di uno strumento POCT di Real-Time PCR per le urgenze virologiche,"RiassuntoPremesse.Per POCT (point of care testing) sâ€™intende lâ€™analisi eseguita vicino al punto di cura del paziente, con il presupposto che il risultato sia disponibile immediatamente o in un lasso di tempo molto breve, al fine di permettere ai clinici una diagnosi rapida e/o una rapida decisione terapeutica. Fino a poco tempo fa tra gli esami effettuati in un POCT non figuravano test di biologia molecolare per la diagnosi delle infezioni virali, a causa della complessitÃ  dei sistemi analitici e delle procedure esecutive di questi test. Negli ultimi anni, perÃ², Ã¨ risultata sempre piÃ¹ evidente la necessitÃ  di diagnosi rapide e semplici anche in questo settore, al fine di permettere decisioni terapeutiche immediate. Una di queste necessitÃ  riguarda la diagnosi delle meningiti e meningoencefaliti virali causate da enterovirus (EV). Un corretto e tempestivo riconoscimento della causa eziologica permetterebbe una terapia piÃ¹ adeguata per i pazienti.Lo scopo di questo studio era confrontare i dati ottenuti dallâ€™utilizzo di una strumentazione POCT per la diagnosi molecolare di infezione da enterovirus con i dati derivati dal procedimento operativo attualmente utilizzato dal Laboratorio, al fine di comparare costi, rapiditÃ  di esecuzione e di diagnosi, semplificazione dei processi operativi, gestione del personale, possibile outcome clinico.Metodi.Attualmente il Laboratorio utilizza un test in Real Time PCR qualitativo per la ricerca degli enterovirus (Enterovirus R-gene, Argene, North Massapequa, NY, USA). Lo studio ha previsto una prima fase di raccolta dei dati sui processi attualmente utilizzati dal Laboratorio (tempi e costi di esecuzione dei test, impegno del personale, difficoltÃ  operative, numero di test utili clinicamente). Successivamente questi dati sono stati confrontati con quelli di un altro test molecolare che utilizza anchâ€™esso un metodo di Real Time PCR qualitativa (Xpert EV, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) con una nuova strumentazione POCT (GeneXpert, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), come descritti da diverse altre pubblicazioni.Risultati.Il confronto tra i due metodi ha dimostrato una sensibilitÃ  e una specificitÃ  sovrapponibili. Dai risultati di questo studio, risulta che il metodo utilizzato attualmente nel nostro Laboratorio non puÃ² essere considerato adeguato per una diagnostica dâ€™urgenza. Al contrario, lâ€™utilizzo del sistema GeneXpert puÃ² portare a una significativa riduzione del tempo di risposta (da 5/6 giorni a 3 ore), del tempo di esecuzione del test (da 5 a 2,45 ore) e del tempo di esecuzione tecnica (da 2 ore a soli 10 minuti). La riduzione del tempo di ospedalizzazione (da 6,6 a 1,2 giorni per i pazienti pediatrici e da 7,3 a 1,9 giorni per gli adulti) e dellâ€™impiego di terapie antibiotiche e antivirali non necessarie fanno di questo test un utile strumento per migliorare la gestione complessiva dei pazienti. Un ulteriore vantaggio Ã¨ rappresentato dalla completa automazione del test e dalla notevole semplicitÃ  di utilizzo. Queste caratteristiche rendono questo sistema adatto a una realtÃ  di point of care utilizzabile anche da personale non specificatamente addestrato.Lâ€™analisi dei costi ha dimostrato un notevole risparmio, grazie alla diminuzione delle spese di degenza (fino a un risparmio del 33%), oltre a una riduzione sostanziale del costo del test (da â‚¬92,25 a â‚¬59,95 per test).Conclusioni.In conclusione, i dati ottenuti indicano che questo nuovo test per enterovirus possiede le caratteristiche ottimali per una sua utile introduzione nella routine diagnostica delle urgenze virali.SummaryBackground.POCT (point of care testing) is defined as medical testing performed nearby or at the site of patient care. This type of analysis allows to obtain the result immediately or very quickly, with the purpose to allow the clinicians to do a rapid diagnosis or to take fast therapeutic decisions. Until recently, among the tests listed in the POCT panel, the molecular biology tests for the diagnosis of viral infections were not included, because of the complexity of the procedures of these tests. However, in recent years, there has been growing evidence of the need of rapid and simple diagnoses also in this field, with the purpose to allow fast therapeutic decisions. One of these necessities concerns the diagnosis of viral meningitis and meningoencephalitis caused by Enteroviruses (EV). A correct and timely identification of the aetiology would allow a more suitable therapy for the patients.The aim of the present study has been to compare the performance characteristics of a POCT instrument for the molecular diagnosis of enteroviral infections, with the data obtained by the analytical method currently used by our Laboratory. We have compared the costs, the rapidity of test execution and clinical diagnosis, the simplification of the procedures, the management of the personnel, and the consequences in the patientâ€™s clinical outcome.Methods.Currently, in our Laboratory we use a Real Time qualitative RT-PCR test for the diagnosis of enteroviral infections (Enterovirus R-gene, Argene, North Massapequa, NY, USA). In this study we have first collected the data about the test currently used in the Laboratory (time and costs of execution, working time of the personnel, operative difficulties, rate of clinically useful tests). Subsequently these data have been compared with the characteristics and features of an alternative molecular Real Time qualitative RT-PCR test (Xpert EV, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) using a new POCT instrument (GeneXpert, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), as described by several published studies.Results.The comparison between the two methods in the study show a substantial overlap of sensitivity and specificity of the two systems. From the results of this study, it appears that the current method used in our Laboratory requires an organization that cannot be considered suitable for emergency care diagnostics. On the contrary, the use of the GeneXpert system can cause a strong reduction in the response time (from 5/6 days to 3 hours), in the execution time of the analysis (from 5 hours to 2.45 hours) and in the handling time for the technician (from 2 hours to just 10 minutes). The reduction in the length of hospital stay (from 6.6 to 1.2 days for infants and from 7.3 to 1.9 days for adults) and in unnecessary antibiotic and antiviral therapy, makes this test very attractive to improve the overall management of patients. A further advantage is represented by the complete automation of the test and the very simple handling. These features allow this system to be implemented also in point-of-care settings and to be used also by not particularly trained personnel.The analysis of costs shows a significant money savings, with lower expenses of hospitalization and clinical management (up to 33% of saving), along with a substantial reduction in the cost of the tests (from â‚¬92.25 to â‚¬59.95 per sample).Conclusions.In conclusion, the data obtained in this study strongly suggest that the new POCT test for Enteroviruses shows optimal characteristics for its useful introduction in the diagnostic routine of viral emergencies.",2013,La Rivista Italiana della Medicina di Laboratorio - Italian Journal of Laboratory Medicine
A Two Biomarker Model Augments Clinical Prediction of Mortality in Melioidosis.,"BACKGROUND
Melioidosis, infection caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a common cause of sepsis with high associated mortality in Southeast Asia. Identification of patients at high-likelihood of clinical deterioration is important for guiding decisions about resource allocation and management. We sought to develop a biomarker-based model for 28-day mortality prediction in melioidosis.


METHODS
In a derivation set (N=113) of prospectively enrolled, hospitalized Thai patients with melioidosis, we measured concentrations of interferon-Î³, interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and interleukin-17A. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to identify a subset of predictive biomarkers and performed logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to evaluate biomarker-based prediction of 28-day mortality compared to clinical variables. We repeated select analyses in an internal validation set (N=78) and in a prospectively enrolled external validation set (N=161) of hospitalized adults with melioidosis in Thailand.


RESULTS
All eight cytokines were positively associated with 28-day mortality. Of these, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 were selected by LASSO regression. A model consisting of interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and clinical variables significantly improved 28-day mortality prediction over a model of only clinical variables (AUC 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.92 vs AUC 0.78, 95% CI 0.69-0.87; P=0.01). In both the internal validation set (AUC 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.97) and the external validation set (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.88), the combined model including biomarkers significantly improved 28-day mortality prediction over a model limited to clinical variables.


CONCLUSIONS
A two biomarker model augments clinical prediction of 28-day mortality in melioidosis.",2020,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America
Magnetic resonance imaging radiomics in categorizing ovarian masses and predicting clinical outcome: a preliminary study,"PurposeTo evaluate the ability of MRI radiomics to categorize ovarian masses and to determine the association between MRI radiomics and survival among ovarian epithelial cancer (OEC) patients.MethodA total of 286 patients with pathologically proven adnexal tumor were retrospectively included in this study. We evaluated diagnostic performance of the signatures derived from MRI radiomics in differentiating (1) between benign adnexal tumors and malignancies and (2) between type I and type II OEC. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was used for radiomics feature selection. Risk scores were calculated from the Lasso model and were used for survival analysis.ResultFor the classification between benign and malignant masses, the MRI radiomics model achieved a high accuracy of 0.90 in the leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation cohort and an accuracy of 0.87 in the independent validation cohort. For the classification between type I and type II subtypes, our method made a satisfactory classification in the LOO cross-validation cohort (accuracyâ€‰=â€‰0.93) and in the independent validation cohort (accuracyâ€‰=â€‰0.84). Low-high-high short-run high gray-level emphasis and low-low-high variance from coronal T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and eccentricity from axial T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) images had the best performance in two classification tasks. The patients with higher risk scores were more likely to have poor prognosis (hazard ratioâ€‰=â€‰4.1694, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001).ConclusionOur results suggest radiomics features extracted from MRI are highly correlated with OEC classification and prognosis of patients. MRI radiomics can provide survival estimations with high accuracy.Key Pointsâ€¢ The MRI radiomics model could achieve a higher accuracy in discriminating benign ovarian diseases from malignancies.â€¢ Low-high-high short-run high gray-level emphasis, low-low-high variance from coronal T2WI, and eccentricity from axial T1WI had the best performance outcomes in various classification tasks.â€¢ The ovarian cancer patients with high-risk scores had poor prognosis.",2019,European Radiology
Immune Landscape of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Tumor Microenvironment Identifies a Prognostic and Immunotherapeutically Relevant Gene Signature,"Background Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is a clinically and molecularly distinct disease. Tumour microenvironment (TME) immune phenotypes play crucial roles in predicting clinical outcomes and therapeutic efficacy. Method In this study, we depict the immune landscape of IDC by using transcriptome profiling and clinical characteristics retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. Immune cell infiltration was evaluated via single-sample gene set enrichment (ssGSEA) analysis and systematically correlated with genomic characteristics and clinicopathological features of IDC patients. Furthermore, an immune signature was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression algorithm. A random forest algorithm was applied to identify the most important somatic gene mutations associated with the constructed immune signature. A nomogram that integrated clinicopathological features with the immune signature to predict survival probability was constructed by multivariate Cox regression. Results The IDC were clustered into low immune infiltration, intermediate immune infiltration, and high immune infiltration by the immune landscape. The high infiltration group had a favourable survival probability compared with that of the low infiltration group. The low-risk score subtype identified by the immune signature was characterized by T cell-mediated immune activation. Additionally, activation of the interferon-Î± response, interferon-Î³ response and TNF-Î± signalling via the NFÎºB pathway was observed in the low-risk score subtype, which indicated T cell activation and may be responsible for significantly favourable outcomes in IDC patients. A random forest algorithm identified the most important somatic gene mutations associated with the constructed immune signature. Furthermore, a nomogram that integrated clinicopathological features with the immune signature to predict survival probability was constructed, revealing that the immune signature was an independent prognostic biomarker. Finally, the relationship of VEGFA, PD1, PDL-1 and CTLA-4 expression with the immune infiltration landscape and the immune signature was analysed to interpret the responses of IDC patients to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Conclusion Taken together, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the immune landscape of IDC and constructed an immune signature related to the immune landscape. This analysis of TME immune infiltration patterns has shed light on how IDC respond to immune checkpoint therapy and may guide the development of novel drug combination strategies.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Bivariate logistic Bayesian LASSO for detecting rare haplotype association with two correlated phenotypes.,"In genetic association studies, joint modeling of related traits/phenotypes can utilize the correlation between them and thereby provide more power and uncover additional information about genetic etiology. Moreover, detecting rare genetic variants are of current scientific interest as a key to missing heritability. Logistic Bayesian LASSO (LBL) has been proposed recently to detect rare haplotype variants using case-control data, that is, a single binary phenotype. As there is currently no haplotype association method that can handle multiple binary phenotypes, we extend LBL to fill this gap. We develop a bivariate model by using a latent variable to induce correlation between the two outcomes. We carry out extensive simulations to investigate the bivariate LBL and compare with the univariate LBL. The bivariate LBL performs better or similar to the univariate LBL in most settings. It has the highest gain in power when a haplotype is associated with both traits and it affects at least one trait in a direction opposite to the direction of the correlation between the traits. We analyze two data sets-Genetic Analysis Workshop 19 sequence data on systolic and diastolic blood pressures and a genome-wide association data set on lung cancer and smoking and detect several associated rare haplotypes.",2019,Genetic epidemiology
CT-Based Radiomic Signature as a Prognostic Factor in Stage IV ALK-Positive Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Treated With TKI Crizotinib: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"Objectives: To identify a computed tomography (CT)-based radiomic signature for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) in stage IV anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib. Materials and Methods: This retrospective proof-of-concept study included a cohort of 63 stage IV ALK-positive NSCLC patients who had received TKI crizotinib therapy for model construction and validation. Another independent cohort including 105 stage IV EGFR-positive NSCLC patients was also used for external validation in EGFR-TKI treatment. We initially extracted 481 quantitative three-dimensional features derived from manually segmented tumor volumes of interest. Pearson's correlation analysis along with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized Cox proportional hazards regression was successively performed to select critical radiomic features. A CT-based radiomic signature for PFS prediction was obtained using multivariate Cox regression. The performance evaluation of the radiomic signature was conducted using the concordance index (C-index), time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and Kaplanâ€“Meier survival analysis. Results: A radiomic signature containing three features showed significant prognostic performance for ALK-positive NSCLC patients in both the training cohort (C-index, 0.744; time-dependent AUC, 0.895) and the validation cohort (C-index, 0.717; time-dependent AUC, 0.824). The radiomic signature could significantly risk-stratify ALK-positive NSCLC patients (hazard ratio, 2.181; P < 0.001) and outperformed other prognostic factors. However, no significant association with PFS was captured for the radiomic signature in the EGFR-positive NSCLC cohort (log-rank tests, P = 0.41). Conclusions: The CT-based radiomic features can capture valuable information regarding the tumor phenotype. The proposed radiomic signature was found to be an effective prognostic factor in stage IV ALK mutated nonsynchronous nodules in NSCLC patients treated with a TKI.",2020,Frontiers in Oncology
Inequality across US counties: an S factor analysis,"A dataset of socioeconomic, demographic and geographic data for US counties (Nâ‰ˆ3,100) was created by merging data from several sources. A suitable subset of 28 socioeconomic indicators was chosen for analysis. Factor analysis revealed a clear general socioeconomic factor (S factor) which was stable across extraction methods and different samples of indicators (absolute split-half sampling reliability = .85). 
 
Self-identified race/ethnicity (SIRE) population percentages were strongly, but non-linearly, related to cognitive ability and S. In general, the effect of White% and Asian% were positive, while those for Black%, Hispanic% and Amerindian% were negative. The effect was unclear for Other/mixed%. The best model consisted of White%, Black%, Asian% and Amerindian% and explained 41/43% of the variance in cognitive ability/S among counties. 
 
SIRE homogeneity had a non-linear relationship to S, both with and without taking into account the effects of SIRE variables. Overall, the effect was slightly negative due to low S, high White% areas. 
Geospatial (latitude, longitude, and elevation) and climatological (temperature, precipitation) predictors were tested in models. In linear regression, they had little incremental validity. However, there was evidence of non-linear relationships. When models were fitted that allowed for non-linear effects of the environmental predictors, they were able to add a moderate amount of incremental validity. LASSO regression, however, suggested that much of this predictive validity was due to overfitting. Furthermore, it was difficult to make causal sense of the results. 
 
Spatial patterns in the data were examined using multiple methods, all of which indicated strong spatial autocorrelation for cognitive ability, S and SIRE (k nearest spatial neighbor regression [KNSNR] correlations of .62 to .89). Model residuals were also spatially autocorrelated, and for this reason the models were re-fit controlling for spatial autocorrelation using KNSNR-based residuals and spatial local regression. The results indicated that the effects of SIREs were not due to spatially autocorrelated confounds except possibly for Black% which was about 50% weaker in the controlled analyses. 
 
Pseudo-multilevel analyses of both the factor structure of S and the SIRE predictive model showed results consistent with the main analyses. Specifically, the factor structure was similar across levels of analysis (states and counties) and within states. Furthermore, the SIRE predictors had similar betas when examined within each state compared to when analyzed across all states. 
 
It was tested whether the relationship between SIREs and S was mediated by cognitive ability. Several methods were used to examine this question and the results were mixed, but generally in line with a partial mediation model. 
 
Jensen's method (method of correlated vectors) was used to examine whether the observed relationship between cognitive ability and S scores was plausibly due to the latent S factor. This was strongly supported (r = .91, Nindicators=28). Similarly, it was examined whether the relationship between SIREs and S scores was plausibly due to the latent S factor. This did not appear to be the case.",2016,

"Jurassic Spora-pollen Assemblages and Paleoclamate in Innermongolia,gansu,qinghai,china","A larger part of Gansu,the west of Innermongolia and the northeast of Qinghai,divided into Alashan,Beiqilian-Hexizoulang,Zhongqilian and Qaidam stratigraphical divisions have been related.In this region there are widely well-developed Jurassic sediments,which include abundant coal and oil natural resources.Based on fully studing Jurassic spores and pollen grains in this area,with preceding achievement,seven spora-pollen assemblages have been established.The low Jurassic includes three assemblages: Protoconiferus-Taeniaesporites,Osmundacidites-Chasmatosporites-Disaccites and Classopollis-Cyathidites-Cycadopites.The Middle Jurassic includes three assemblages: Cyathidites-Quadraeculina-Cycadopites,Cyathidites-Callialasporites-Pinuspollenites and Classopollis-Cyathidites-Inaperturopllenites.The Upper Jurassic only establishes Classopollis assemblage.Using paleoecology of mother plant of spores and pollen,combing the range of special rocks implying paleoclimate in strata,Jurassic climate has been studied,which includes Jurassic climate structure and evolution rule.It is suggested that the Jurassic climate locates the subtropical-moderate climate zone.Under this background,there is a fluctuated temperature-rising and humidity-falling events occur in late early Jurassic(Toarcian).The late middle Jurassic climate is comparatively hot and arid.This hot and arid phenomenon is so further aggravate that the whole area is hot and arid in late Jurassic.The temperature is higher in Qaidam basin and Zhongqilian area than that of other place in the early-middle early Jurassic.The humidity in Yabulai basin is smaller than that of other place in the early middle Jurassic,but it is larger than that of other place in the late middle Jurassic in Qaidam basin.All of the research region are hot and arid in late Jurassic.The early-middle Jurassic is major period of assembling and generating coal and hydrocarbon with flourishing fauna and flora,coal bed and dark mudstone in Alashan,Zhongqilian and north of Qaidam basin.It is advantage for forming oil and gas-bearing depression,which is advantaged explorating area.",2006,Natural Gas Geoscience
The utility of LASSO-based models for real time forecasts of endemic infectious diseases: A cross country comparison,"
               Abstract
               
                  Introduction
                  Accurate and timely prediction for endemic infectious diseases is vital for public health agencies to plan and carry out any control methods at an early stage of disease outbreaks. Climatic variables has been identified as important predictors in models for infectious disease forecasts. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to produce accurate and timely predictions and potentially improve public health response.
               
               
                  Methods
                  We assessed how the machine learning LASSO method may be useful in providing useful forecasts for different pathogens in countries with different climates. Separate LASSO models were constructed for different disease/country/forecast window with different model complexity by including different sets of predictors to assess the importance of different predictors under various conditions.
               
               
                  Results
                  There was a more apparent cyclicity for both climatic variables and incidence in regions further away from the equator. For most diseases, predictions made beyond 4â€¯weeks ahead were increasingly discrepant from the actual scenario. Prediction models were more accurate in capturing the outbreak but less sensitive to predict the outbreak size. In different situations, climatic variables have different levels of importance in prediction accuracy.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  For LASSO models used for prediction, including different sets of predictors has varying effect in different situations. Short term predictions generally perform better than longer term predictions, suggesting public health agencies may need the capacity to respond at short-notice to early warnings.

"Mechanism for circularization of linear DNAs: circular parvovirus MVM DNA is formed by a ""noose"" sliding in a ""lasso""-like DNA structure.","During an electron-microscopic survey with the aim of identifying the parvovirus MVM transcription template, we observed previously unidentified structures of MVM DNA in lysates of virus-infected cells. These included double-stranded ""lasso""-like structures and relaxed circles. Both structures were of unit length MVM DNA, indicating that they were not intermediates formed during replication; they each represented about 5% of the total nuclear MVM DNA. The proportion of these structures was unchanged after digestion with sodium dodecyl sulfate/Pronase and RNase and after mild denaturation treatment. Cleavage of the ""lasso"" structures with EcoRI restriction endonuclease indicated that the ""noose"" part of the ""lasso"" structure is located on the 5' side of the genomic single-stranded MVM DNA. A model is presented for the molecular nature of the circularization process of MVM DNA in which the ""lasso"" structures are identified as intermediates during circle formation. This model proposes a mechanism for circularization of linear DNAs.",1979,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Differential Protein Expression During Growth on Medium Versus Long-Chain Alkanes in the Obligate Marine Hydrocarbon-Degrading Bacterium Thalassolituus oleivorans MIL-1,"The marine obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium Thalassolituus oleivorans MIL-1 metabolizes a broad range of aliphatic hydrocarbons almost exclusively as carbon and energy sources. We used LC-MS/MS shotgun proteomics to identify proteins involved in aerobic alkane degradation during growth on medium- (n-C14) or long-chain (n-C28) alkanes. During growth on n-C14, T. oleivorans expresses an alkane monooxygenase system involved in terminal oxidation including two alkane 1-monooxygenases, a ferredoxin, a ferredoxin reductase and an aldehyde dehydrogenase. In contrast, during growth on long-chain alkanes (n-C28), T. oleivorans may switch to a subterminal alkane oxidation pathway evidenced by significant upregulation of Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase and an esterase, proteins catalyzing ketone and ester metabolism, respectively. The metabolite (primary alcohol) generated from terminal oxidation of an alkane was detected during growth on n-C14 but not on n-C28 also suggesting alternative metabolic pathways. Expression of both active and passive transport systems involved in uptake of long-chain alkanes was higher when compared to the non-hydrocarbon control, including a TonB-dependent receptor, a FadL homolog and a specialized porin. Also, an inner membrane transport protein involved in the export of an outer membrane protein was expressed. This study has demonstrated the substrate range of T. oleivorans is larger than previously reported with growth from n-C10 up to n-C32. It has also greatly enhanced our understanding of the fundamental physiology of T. oleivorans, a key bacterium that plays a significant role in natural attenuation of marine oil pollution, by identifying key enzymes expressed during the catabolism of n-alkanes.",2018,Frontiers in Microbiology
A Tutorial on Model-Assisted Estimation with Application to Forest Inventory,"National forest inventories in many countries combine expensive ground plot data with remotely-sensed information to improve precision in estimators of forest parameters. A simple post-stratified estimator is often the tool of choice because it has known statistical properties, is easy to implement, and is intuitive to the many users of inventory data. Because of the increased availability of remotely-sensed data with improved spatial, temporal, and thematic resolutions, there is a need to equip the inventory community with a more diverse array of statistical estimators. Focusing on generalized regression estimators, we step the reader through seven estimators including: Horvitz Thompson, ratio, post-stratification, regression, lasso, ridge, and elastic net. Using forest inventory data from Daggett county in Utah, USA as an example, we illustrate how to construct, as well as compare the relative performance of, these estimators. Augmented by simulations, we also show how the standard variance estimator suffers from greater negative bias than the bootstrap variance estimator, especially as the size of the assisting model grows. Each estimator is made readily accessible through the new R package, mase. We conclude with guidelines in the form of a decision tree on when to use which an estimator in forest inventory applications.",2020,Forests
Genomic growth curves of an outbred pig population,"In the current post-genomic era, the genetic basis of pig growth can be understood by assessing SNP marker effects and genomic breeding values (GEBV) based on estimates of these growth curve parameters as phenotypes. Although various statistical methods, such as random regression (RR-BLUP) and Bayesian LASSO (BL), have been applied to genomic selection (GS), none of these has yet been used in a growth curve approach. In this work, we compared the accuracies of RR-BLUP and BL using empirical weight-age data from an outbred F2 (Brazilian Piau X commercial) population. The phenotypes were determined by parameter estimates using a nonlinear logistic regression model and the halothane gene was considered as a marker for evaluating the assumptions of the GS methods in relation to the genetic variation explained by each locus. BL yielded more accurate values for all of the phenotypes evaluated and was used to estimate SNP effects and GEBV vectors. The latter allowed the construction of genomic growth curves, which showed substantial genetic discrimination among animals in the final growth phase. The SNP effect estimates allowed identification of the most relevant markers for each phenotype, the positions of which were coincident with reported QTL regions for growth traits.",2013,Genetics and Molecular Biology
Noisy Subspace Clustering via Matching Pursuits,"Sparsity-based subspace clustering algorithms have attracted significant attention thanks to their excellent performance in practical applications. A prominent example is the sparse subspace clustering (SSC) algorithm by Elhamifar and Vidal, which performs spectral clustering based on an adjacency matrix obtained by sparsely representing each data point in terms of all the other data points via the Lasso. When the number of data points is large or the dimension of the ambient space is high, the computational complexity of SSC quickly becomes prohibitive. Dyer et al. observed that SSC-orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) obtained by replacing the Lasso by the greedy OMP algorithm results in significantly lower computational complexity, while often yielding comparable performance. The central goal of this paper is an analytical performance characterization of SSC-OMP for noisy data. Moreover, we introduce and analyze the SSC-matching pursuit (MP) algorithm, which employs MP in lieu of OMP. Both SSC-OMP and SSC-MP are proven to succeed even when the subspaces intersect and when the data points are contaminated by severe noise. The clustering conditions we obtain for SSC-OMP and SSC-MP are similar to those for SSC and for the thresholding-based subspace clustering (TSC) algorithm due to Heckel and BÃ¶lcskei. Analytical results in combination with numerical results indicate that both SSC-OMP and SSC-MP with a data-dependent stopping criterion automatically detect the dimensions of the subspaces underlying the data. Experiments on synthetic and on real data show that SSC-MP often matches or exceeds the performance of the computationally more expensive SSC-OMP algorithm. Moreover, SSC-MP compares very favorably to SSC, TSC, and the nearest subspace neighbor algorithm, both in terms of clustering performance and running time. In addition, we find that, in contrast to SSC-OMP, the performance of SSC-MP is very robust with respect to the choice of parameters in the stopping criteria.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory

SMS could be sent through Computerized Immunization Registers (CIR), hosted by HC computers. 210 mothers of children aged 0 to 5 years were chosen at random and questioned if they owned a mobile phone, if they could read a SMS, or, if not, what language they would understand if a voice SMS was sent. They were also asked if a family member could receive, read and transmit the message, if mothers did not own a mobile phone. They were also asked if they are willing to give their telephone number to HC. 94% of mothers could be reached through written or voice SMS, sent to their own or family memberâ€™s mobile phone. 100% of mothers would be willing to give their telephone number to their HC to improve their ability to come at the right time for vaccination sessions. SMS reminders, delivered through CIR, should improve EPI attendance and management of sessions in HC, especially in epidemic context.",2012,Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© de pathologie exotique
Learning Dynamic Conditional Gaussian Graphical Models,"In the paper, we propose a class of dynamic conditional Gaussian graphical models (DCGGMs) based on a set of non-identical distribution observations, which changes smoothly with time or condition. Specifically, the DCGGMs model the dynamic output network influenced by conditioning input variables, which are encoded by a set of varying parameters. Moreover, we propose a joint smooth graphical Lasso to estimate the DCGGMs, which combines kernel smoother with sparse group Lasso penalty. At the same time, we design an efficient accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to solve this estimator. Theoretically, we establish the asymptotic properties of our model on consistency and sparsistency under the high-dimensional settings. In particular, we highlight a class of consistency theory for dynamic graphical models, in which the sample size can be seen as <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n^{4/5}$ </tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""huang-ieq1-2777462.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> for estimating a local graphical model when the bandwidth parameter <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$h$ </tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""huang-ieq2-2777462.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> of kernel smoother is chosen as <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$h\; \asymp\; n^{-1/5}$</tex-math> <alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""huang-ieq3-2777462.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> for describing the dynamic. Finally, the extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets are provided to support the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering
Jackknife Model Averaging Prediction Methods for Complex Phenotypes with Gene Expression Levels by Integrating External Pathway Information,"Motivation In the past few years many novel prediction approaches have been proposed and widely employed in high dimensional genetic data for disease risk evaluation. However, those approaches typically ignore in model fitting the important group structures or functional classifications that naturally exists in genetic data. Methods In the present study, we applied a novel model averaging approach, called Jackknife Model Averaging Prediction (JMAP), for high dimensional genetic risk prediction while incorporating KEGG pathway information into the model specification. JMAP selects the optimal weights across candidate models by minimizing a cross-validation criterion in a jackknife way. Compared with previous approaches, one of the primary features of JMAP is to allow model weights to vary from 0 to 1 but without the limitation that the summation of weights is equal to one. We evaluated the performance of JMAP using extensive simulation studies and compared it with existing methods. We finally applied JMAP to five real cancer datasets that are publicly available from TCGA. Results The simulations showed that, compared with other existing approaches, JMAP performed best or are among the best methods across a range of scenarios. For example, among 14 out of 16 simulation settings with PVE=0.3, JMAP has an average of 0.075 higher prediction accuracy compared with gsslasso. We further found that in the simulation the model weights for the true candidate models have much smaller chances to be zero compared with those for the null candidate models and are substantially greater in magnitude. In the real data application, JMAP also behaves comparably or better compared with the other methods for both continuous and binary phenotypes. For example, for the COAD, CRC and PAAD data sets, the average gains of predictive accuracy of JMAP are 0.019, 0.064 and 0.052 compared with gsslasso. Conclusion The proposed method JMAP is a novel method that can provide more accurate phenotypic prediction while incorporating external useful group information.",2019,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine
Pollen eaters and pollen morphology : co-evolution through the Permian and Mesozoic,"In each of the sequential periods of seed-plant evolution, there were ""charismatic"" pollen grains that fascinated generations of palynologists. In the Permian, such peculiar pollen morphologies included taeniate pollen (with the wall split into bands, or taeniae) of Protohaploxypinus-Lunatisporites and Vittatina groups. One or more types of taeniate pollen prevailed in the pollen load of several species of Permian insects. The advent of the Mesozoic era was marked by a spread of smooth asaccate pollen of ""Ginkgocycadophytus"" type, virtually indistinguishable in the dominant orders of Mesozoic gymnosperms. Such pollen was never found in the guts. Charismatic through the Mesozoic was the rimulate pollen of Classopollis type. It constituted a monospecific load in the guts of large Jurassic katydids (Aboilus, Haglidae). The Eucommiidites group, related to gnetophytes, is peculiar in having lateral grooves parallel to the main sulcus. Recently this pollen type has been found in the gut compression of a xyelid, genus Ceroxyela. The reason why Palaeozoic and Mesozoic insects showed preferences for pollen with distinctive morphologies might be that, on the basis of the surface ornamentation of these different varieties, insects were able to distinguish edible pollen types. The distinctive pollen morphologies might have evolved primarily for this purpose.",2007,African Invertebrates
Recent Advances in Pediatric Otolaryngology,"Ear, nose, and throat problems comprise a significant portion of patient visits to the primary care physicians' offices, urgent care facilities, emergency rooms, and children's hospitals. Since its beginnings in the 1970s, the specialty of pediatric otolaryngology has developed significantly and even more so in the last five to ten years. The aim of this special issue is to offer our pediatrician colleagues an opportunity to learn about recent advances in both diagnostic methods and therapeutic procedures that are now available to assist in the care of children with ear, nose, and throat disorders. 
 
This special issue is comprised of both original clinical research and review articles from all areas of pediatric otolaryngology such as otologic disease and hearing loss, sinonasal disorders, airway issues, and head and neck masses. These papers emphasize how methods of diagnosis have improved for certain conditions, how existing surgical procedures have been modified to be less invasive and better tolerated, and finally, how new technology and operations allow clinicians to treat otolaryngologic disorders that were without treatment in the past. 
 
The paper â€œTroublesome tinnitus in children: epidemiology, audiological profile, and preliminary Results of Treatmentâ€ by G. Bartnik et al. offers a very readable and practical approach to a common otologic problem in children while most pediatric textbooks often have no information on this subject. This group offers their experience with a treatment called â€œTinnitus Retraining Therapy.â€ A. Koravand, B. Jutras, and M. Lassonde present their original research using the diagnostic tools of cortical auditory evoked potentials and mismatch responses (MMRs) to identify patterns of neural activity in the central auditory system of children with hearing loss. 
 
The care of patients with nose and sinus complaints can be frustrating to the primary care physician. H. Ramadan's paper â€œChronic rhinosinusitis in childrenâ€ provides a simple, straightforward approach to the pediatric patient with these symptoms including the use of â€œreal-lifeâ€ examples to illustrate the important aspects of the history and physical exam that are necessary in the care of these patients. After reading this article, any health care practitioner will feel more confident about their decision-making in patients with sinus disease. Although juvenile angiofibroma is a rare clinical problem, P. Nicolai, A. Schreiber, and A. B. Villaret describe new, less invasive approaches to treatment of this sinonasal mass. This is in addition to a succinct review of the pathophysiology and recommended work-up including the relative advantages and disadvantages of various radiographic imaging techniques. 
 
The airway section of this special issue will be of great value to the primary care practitioner. Included are three papers on stridor in the infant, one dedicated entirely to laryngomalacia, and lastly, a paper on a new diagnostic tool called â€œsleep endoscopy.â€ M. Daniel and A. Cheng discuss the approach to an infant with noisy breathing or stridor; separating the material into three sections that allow for easy recall and use by the pediatrician. Novel approaches such as the EXIT procedure to treat disorders of the fetal airway are presented. A. M. Landry and D. M. Thompson's review article on laryngomalacia will be equally relevant. The reader will find it to be complete yet easily digestible. Finally, any health care practitioner will be familiar with the frustration of seeing patients for persistent difficulty breathing at night after adenotonsillectomy for upper airway obstruction or obstructive sleep apnea. Although polysomnography can determine the presence and severity of any degree of obstruction, it cannot identify the location of obstruction. The paper by A. C. Lin and P. J. Koltai describe a new diagnostic tool called â€œsleep endoscopyâ€ that will allow otolaryngologists the opportunity to identify such areas of obstruction and perhaps offer treatment options which were not obvious in the past. 
 
The approach to a patient with a vascular malformation can be confusing. G. T. Richter's review article on this clinical entity will be very helpful to the primary care practitioner. Nomenclature, relevant parts of the history and physical exam, diagnostic tools including radiographic imaging studies, and medical and surgical therapies are discussed. D. Dzepina's paper on papillary thyroid carcinoma in children describes their approach and results with total thyroidectomy including neck dissection for lymphatic dissemination which is common in this type of thyroid cancer. 
 
The editors of this special issue have worked hard with the authors to provide primary care practitioners with information that is relevant to their practice and, at the same time, very easy to read and understand. We hope the papers in this special issue will be of great help to primary care practitioners as they see pediatric patients with ear, nose, and throat problems.

A Bayesian LASSO Algorithm for Simultaneous Variation Fault Diagnosis in Ill Conditioned Multistage Manufacturing Processes,"Fault diagnosis is an effective way to address the dimensional quality challenges by identifying failing process characteristics in multistage manufacturing processes. A significant number of literature is found addressing the problem with an implicit assumption of number of measurement points exceeds the number of process error sources. In reality due to economical constraints this assumption is frequently violated, resulting into an illconditioned process that provides less than full column rank models to describe the relationship between the product quality and process error sources. Under such circumstances, no mathematically unique solution do exist which is a hindrance in accurately diagnosing the faults arising. In this study, the fault diagnosis problem in such processes is presented as a variable selection problem and assuming sparsity of faults, an amalgamation of state space model and Bayesian Hierarchical Model for LASSO based regularized regression is adopted. To estimate the failing process elements through the Bayesian LASSO problem the popular stochastic simulation methods, viz., Gibbs Sampling is employed. A floor pan assembly problem is studied to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. Results obtained are promising and effective in successfully identifying process faults.",2015,
