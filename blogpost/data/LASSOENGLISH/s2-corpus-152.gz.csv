"Naufragio y rescate de la flota y armada del marquÃ©s del Vado del Maestre, 1691","The complex structure of the navy that was heading of Tierra Firme of the late seventeenth century is evident trough the analysis of the ships from the fleet and armada of General Diego de Cordoba Lasso de la Vega, Marquis of the Vado del Maestre, the quality of the ships that made the transport of flows to the Iberian Peninsula, life on board and the existence of a protocol system in the event of an incident. The loss of any of the ships that transported precious metals to Spain would aggravate even more the problems to the Castilian treasury. Should it occur, the Crown would have to promptly execute a plan of search and rescue in order to obtain valuable cargos.",2019,Anuario De Estudios Americanos
Group Lasso for generalized linear models in high dimension,Nowadays an increasing amount of data is available and we have to deal with models in high dimension (number of covariates much larger than the sample size). Under sparsity assumption it is reasonable to hope that we can make a good estimation of the regression parameter. This sparsity assumption as well as a block structuration of the covariates into groups with similar modes of behavior is for example quite natural in genomics. A huge amount of scientific literature exists for Gaussian linear models including the Lasso estimator and also the Group Lasso estimator which promotes group sparsity under an a priori knowledge of the groups. We extend this Group Lasso procedure to generalized linear models and we study the properties of this estimator for sparse high-dimensional generalized linear models to find convergence rates. We provide oracle inequalities for the prediction and estimation error under assumptions on the covariables and under a condition on the design matrix. We show the ability of this estimator to recover good sparse approximation of the true model. At last we extend these results to the case of an Elastic net penalty and we apply them to the so-called Poisson regression case which has not been studied in this context contrary to the logistic regression.,2014,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Group induced graphical lasso allows for discovery of molecular pathways-pathways interactions,"Complex systems may contain heterogeneous types of variables that interact in a multi-level and multi-scale manner. In this context, high-level layers may considered as groups of variables interacting in lower-level layers. This is particularly true in biology, where, for example, genes are grouped in pathways and two types of interactions are present: pathway-pathway interactions and gene-gene interactions. However, from data it is only possible to measure the expression of genes while it is impossible to directly measure the activity of pathways. Nevertheless, the knowledge on the inter-dependence between the groups and the variables allows for a multi-layer network inference, on both observed variables and groups, even if no direct information on the latter is present in the data (hence groups are considered as latent). In this paper, we propose an extension of the latent graphical lasso method that leverages on the knowledge of the inter-links between the hidden (groups) and observed layers. The method exploits the knowledge of group structure that influence the behaviour of observed variables to retrieve a two layers network. Its efficacy was tested on synthetic data to check its ability in retrieving the network structure compared to the ground truth. We present a case study on Neuroblastoma, which shows how our multi-level inference is relevant in real contexts to infer biologically meaningful connections.",2018,ArXiv
Can targeted metabolomics predict depression recovery? Results from the CO-MED trial,"Metabolomics is a developing and promising tool for exploring molecular pathways underlying symptoms of depression and predicting depression recovery. The AbsoluteIDQâ„¢ p180 kit was used to investigate whether plasma metabolites (sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, and acylcarnitines) from a subset of participants in the Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes (CO-MED) trial could act as predictors or biologic correlates of depression recovery. Participants in this trial were assigned to one of three pharmacological treatment arms: escitalopram monotherapy, bupropion-escitalopram combination, or venlafaxine-mirtazapine combination. Plasma was collected at baseline in 159 participants and again 12 weeks later at study exit in 83 of these participants. Metabolite concentrations were measured and combined with clinical and sociodemographic variables using the hierarchical lasso to simultaneously model whether specific metabolites are particularly informative of depressive recovery. Increased baseline concentrations of phosphatidylcholine C38:1 showed poorer outcome based on change in the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS). In contrast, an increased ratio of hydroxylated sphingomyelins relative to non-hydroxylated sphingomyelins at baseline and a change from baseline to exit suggested a better reduction of symptoms as measured by QIDS score. All metabolite-based models performed superior to models only using clinical and sociodemographic variables, suggesting that metabolomics may be a valuable tool for predicting antidepressant outcomes.",2019,Translational Psychiatry
Discrimination of mediastinal metastatic lymph nodes in NSCLC based on radiomic features in different phases of CT imaging,"We aimed to develop radiomic models based on different phases of computed tomography (CT) imaging and to investigate the efficacy of models for diagnosing mediastinal metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Eighty-six NSCLC patients were enrolled in this study, and we selected 231 mediastinal LNs confirmed by pathology results as the subjects which were divided into training (nâ€‰=â€‰163) and validation cohorts (nâ€‰=â€‰68). The regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated on CT scans in the plain phase, arterial phase and venous phase, respectively. Radiomic features were extracted from the CT images in each phase. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used to select features, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to build models. We constructed six models (orders 1â€“6) based on the radiomic features of the single- and dual-phase CT images. The performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). A total of 846 features were extracted from each ROI, and 10, 9, 5, 2, 2, and 9 features were chosen to develop models 1â€“6, respectively. All of the models showed excellent discrimination, with AUCs greater than 0.8. The plain CT radiomic model, model 1, yielded the highest AUC, specificity, accuracy and PPV, which were 0.926 and 0.925; 0.860 and 0.769; 0.871 and 0.882; and 0.906 and 0.870 in the training and validation sets, respectively. When the plain and venous phase CT radiomic features were combined with the arterial phase CT images, the sensitivity increased from 0.879 and 0.919 to 0.949 and 0979 and the NPV increased from 0.821 and 0.789 to 0.878 and 0.900 in the training group, respectively. All of the CT radiomic models based on different phases all showed high accuracy and precision for the diagnosis of LN metastasis (LNM) in NSCLC patients. When combined with arterial phase CT, the sensitivity and NPV of the model was be further improved.",2020,BMC Medical Imaging
A Functional Generalized Linear Model with Curve Selection in Cervical Pre-cancer Diagnosis Using Fluorescence Spectroscopy,"A functional generalized linear model is applied to spectroscopic data to discriminate disease from non-disease in the diagnosis of cervical pre- cancer. For each observation, multiple functional covariates are available, and it is of interest to select a few of them for efficient classification. In addition to multiple functional covariates, some non-functional covariates are also used to account for systematic differences caused by these covariates. Functional principal components are used to reduce the model to multivariate logistic regression and a grouped Lasso penalty is applied to the reduced model to select useful functional covariates among multiple curves.",2009,
"[Knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare professionals at the Souro Sanou university hospital of Bobo Dioulasso regarding Mellitus diabetes].","INTRODUCTION
In Burkina Faso, the insufficiency of doctoral interns, of endocrinologists, and medical services specialized in the coverage of the diabetes, means that these cases are relegated to general practitioners and the paramedical staff.


OBJECTIVES
To study the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices of the medical and paramedical staff on the coverage of sugar diabetes in the Souro Sanou University Hospital of Bobo Dioulasso.


METHOD
A cross-sectional study of descriptive type was conducted over a 3 month period, from March 1st to May 31st, 2013. The investigated population was constituted of healthcare professionals represented by general practitioners, female nurses, State-certified male nurses, and patented male nurses of the Souro Sanou University Hospital of Bobo Dioulasso. A questionnaire, adapted for each professional category, was administered to the participants. A notation grid enabled us to record the level of knowledge, attitude and practice of the staff regarding sugar induced diabetes.


RESULTS
Three hundred four (304) healthcare professionals, 187 men and 117 women (sex ratio of 1.59) were investigated. The average age was of 40.84 years with extremes of 26 and 60 years. Their level of knowledge, attitude and practice on sugar induced diabetes varied from one professional category to another. Clinical signs of the disease, as well as its physiopathology were well known by healthcare providers. However, the definition of the disease, its diagnostic criteria, its classification by cause, were little known general practitioners. The general practitioners, had a good attitude and practice in front of a case of diabetes compared to other professional categories.


CONCLUSION
Adapted staff recycling is essential across the professional categories for healthcare providers of the university hospital.",2016,Le Mali medical
Optimal reduced sets for sparse kernel spectral clustering,"Kernel spectral clustering (KSC) solves a weighted kernel principal component analysis problem in a primal-dual optimization framework. It results in a clustering model using the dual solution of the problem. It has a powerful out-of-sample extension property leading to good clustering generalization w.r.t. the unseen data points. The out-of-sample extension property allows to build a sparse model on a small training set and introduces the first level of sparsity. The clustering dual model is expressed in terms of non-sparse kernel expansions where every point in the training set contributes. The goal is to find reduced set of training points which can best approximate the original solution. In this paper a second level of sparsity is introduced in order to reduce the time complexity of the computationally expensive out-of-sample extension. In this paper we investigate various penalty based reduced set techniques including the Group Lasso, L0, L1 + L0 penalization and compare the amount of sparsity gained w.r.t. a previous L1 penalization technique. We observe that the optimal results in terms of sparsity corresponds to the Group Lasso penalization technique in majority of the cases. We showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches on several real world datasets and an image segmentation dataset.",2014,2014 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)
A Survey on Evolutionary Co-Clustering Formulations for Mining Time-Varying Data Using Sparsity Learning,"The data matrix is considered as static in Traditional clustering and feature selection methods. However, the data matrices evolve smoothly over time in many applications. A simple approach to learn from these time-evolving data matrices is to analyze them separately. Such strategy ignores the time-dependent nature of the underlying data. Two formulations are proposed for evolutionary co-clustering and feature selection based on the fused Lasso regularization. The evolutionary co-clustering formulation is able to identify smoothly varying data embedded into the matrices along with the temporal dimension. Formulation allows for imposing smoothness constraints over temporal dimension of the data matrices. The evolutionary feature selection formulation can uncover shared features in clustering from time-evolving data matrices.",2015,International Journal of Innovative Research in Computer and Communication Engineering
Survival prediction and variable selection with simultaneous shrinkage and grouping priors,"The presented work is motivated by the need of reliably estimating and predicting the survival rates for individuals diagnosed with cancer, when gene expression profiles are available for identifying molecular risks factors for cancer. The regression analysis of such data is challenged by three characteristics of data: i time-to-event outcome, ii high-dimensional covariate space, and iii a group structure of genes. One strategy to simultaneously deal with all three of the aforementioned challenges is to build a penalized regression model using special penalty functions such as elastic net, fused lasso, and group lasso. To our knowledge, existing methods are sparse or non-existent, however, when a Bayesian estimation/inference is the goal for the penalized regression models. In this article, we propose a Bayesian semi-parametric framework for the regression analysis of gene expression data with survival outcomes. Our proposed Bayesian methods permit researchers to take advantage of numerous benefits including the ability to incorporate substantive prior information, the straightforward and automated quantification of uncertainty in prediction, and the prescriptive nature of computation. The performance of our proposed models for variable selection and prediction is thoroughly investigated through simulation studies, where we consider four scenarios based on different underlying group structures of covariates and covariate effects. The results generally show the satisfactory variable selection capability and predictability of our methods. Finally, we apply our proposed framework to three different gene expression data sets. We developed an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the implementation of our proposed framework and provided an easy-to-use R package.",2015,Statistical Analysis and Data Mining

"Estimation of Graphical Lasso using the $L_{1,2}$ Norm","Gaussian graphical models are recently used in economics to obtain networks of dependence among agents. A widely-used estimator is the Graphical Lasso (GLASSO), which amounts to a maximum likelihood estimation regularized using the $L_{1,1}$ matrix norm on the precision matrix $\Omega$. The $L_{1,1}$ norm is a lasso penalty that controls for sparsity, or the number of zeros in $\Omega$. We propose a new estimator called Structured Graphical Lasso (SGLASSO) that uses the $L_{1,2}$ mixed norm. The use of the $L_{1,2}$ penalty controls for the structure of the sparsity in $\Omega$. We show that when the network size is fixed, SGLASSO is asymptotically equivalent to an infeasible GLASSO problem which prioritizes the sparsity-recovery of high-degree nodes. Monte Carlo simulation shows that SGLASSO outperforms GLASSO in terms of estimating the overall precision matrix and in terms of estimating the structure of the graphical model. In an empirical illustration using a classic firms' investment dataset, we obtain a network of firms' dependence that exhibits the core-periphery structure, with General Motors, General Electric and U.S. Steel forming the core group of firms.",2017,arXiv: Econometrics

Bioactivity and genome guided isolation of a novel antimicrobial protein from Thalassomonas viridans,"The continued emergence of bacterial resistance to the antibiotics currently employed to treat several diseases has added to the urgency to discover and develop novel antibiotics. It is well established that natural products have been the source of the most effective antibiotics that are currently being used to treat infectious diseases and they remain a major source for drug production. Natural products derived from marine microorganisms have received much attention in recent years due to their applications in human health. One of the biggest bottlenecks in the drug discovery pipeline is the rediscovery of known compounds. Hence, dereplication strategies such as genome sequencing, genome mining and LCMS/MS among others, are essential for unlocking novel chemistry as it directs compound discovery away from previously described compounds. In this study, the genome of a marine microorganism, Thalassomonas viridans XOM25T was mined and its antimicrobial activity was assessed against a range of microorganisms. Genome sequencing data revealed that T. viridans is a novel bacterium with an average nucleotide identity of 81% to its closest relative T. actiniarum. Furthermore, genome mining data revealed that 20% of the genome was committed to secondary metabolisms and that the pathways were highly novel at a sequence level. To our knowledge, this species has not previously been exploited for its antimicrobial activity. Hence, the aim of this study was to screen for bioactivity and identify the biosynthetic gene/s responsible for the observed bioactivity in T. viridans using a bioassay-and-genomeguided isolation approach to assess the bioactive agent. The bioassay-guided fractionation approach coupled to LCMS/MS led to the identification of a novel antimicrobial protein, TVP1. Bioinformatic analyses showed that TVP1 is a novel antimicrobial protein that is found in the tail region of a prophage in the T. viridans genome.

On lassos and the Jones polynomial of satellite knots,"In this master thesis, I present a new family of knots in the solid torus called lassos, and their properties. Given a knot $K$ with Alexander polynomial $\Delta_K(t)$, I then use these lassos as patterns to construct families of satellite knots that have Alexander polynomial $\Delta_K(t^d)$ where $d\in\mathbb{N}\cup \{0\}$. In particular, I prove that if $d\in\{0,1,2,3\}$ these satellite knots have different Jones polynomials. For this purpose, I give rise to a formula for calculating the Jones polynomial of a satellite knot in terms of the Jones polynomials of its pattern and companion.",2015,arXiv: Geometric Topology
SeqGL Identifies Context-Dependent Binding Signals in Genome-Wide Regulatory Element Maps,"Genome-wide maps of transcription factor (TF) occupancy and regions of open chromatin implicitly contain DNA sequence signals for multiple factors. We present SeqGL, a novel de novo motif discovery algorithm to identify multiple TF sequence signals from ChIP-, DNase-, and ATAC-seq profiles. SeqGL trains a discriminative model using a k-mer feature representation together with group lasso regularization to extract a collection of sequence signals that distinguish peak sequences from flanking regions. Benchmarked on over 100 ChIP-seq experiments, SeqGL outperformed traditional motif discovery tools in discriminative accuracy. Furthermore, SeqGL can be naturally used with multitask learning to identify genomic and cell-type context determinants of TF binding. SeqGL successfully scales to the large multiplicity of sequence signals in DNase- or ATAC-seq maps. In particular, SeqGL was able to identify a number of ChIP-seq validated sequence signals that were not found by traditional motif discovery algorithms. Thus compared to widely used motif discovery algorithms, SeqGL demonstrates both greater discriminative accuracy and higher sensitivity for detecting the DNA sequence signals underlying regulatory element maps.

"Carta dei geomorfositi e della geodiversitÃ  d'Ifrane-Azrou (Medio Atlante, Marocco).","This research has been carried out in the framework of a Doctorate Thesis at the University Mohammed V-Agdal of Rabat (Ms. Amina Malaki) and has consisted in the individuation, the study and the cataloguing of forty sites of geological and geomorphological interest of particular scientific, didactic or touristic-cultural value in the region of the Middle Atlas of Ifrane-Azrou (Morocco). The choice of geosites and geomorphosites as main objective of this thesis is determined by the absolute lack of specific researches on these topics in Morocco, but also by the existence of geological and geomorphological characteristics and phenomena that ensure the presence of a large number of natural and cultural sites related to geology and geomorphology, that deserve to be better known, safeguarded and valorised. The acquired information, together with several itineraries, have been resumed in a geo-thematic Map that represents a valid synthesis of the obtained results, able to give an overview of the consistence and of the territorial distribution of the geological and geomorphological sites, representing the geological heritage of the Middle Atlas, up to now mostly ignored or poorly evaluated. This Map contains the proposals for the integration of the traditional tourist routes mainly based on cultural heritage (e.g. imperial cities) with these geomorphological sites and the geological landscape. Introduzione Il territorio del Marocco, com'Ã¨ noto e come Ã¨ stato ampiamente riconosciuto dagli studiosi, Ã¨ caratterizzato dall'affioramento di terreni di natura eruttiva, sedimentaria e metamorfica i quali custodiscono testimonianze di eventi e processi che consentono di ricostruire il lungo divenire della storia della terra e che gli conferiscono un eccezionale livello in termini di geodiversitÃ  e di georisorse (cfr. Barca, Di Gregorio, 1999). Tali beni, conosciuti con i termini di geositi e geomorfositi, sono parte integrante del patrimonio culturale del territorio, e possono arricchire in modo sensibile gli esistenti itinerari turistici, spesso legati esclusivamente ai beni architettonici e storico-archeologici. Una delle regioni piÃ¹ interessanti sotto questo punto di vista Ã¨ lâ€™area che comprende le cittÃ  di Ifrane e di Azrou nel Medio Atlante che si trovano lungo le rotte turistiche che collegano le cittÃ  imperiali di MeknÃ¨s e di FÃ¨s con il Sud del paese. In questo lavoro vengono presentati i risultati ottenuti durante una ricerca, effettuata nellâ€™ambito di una tesi di Dottorato dellâ€™UniversitÃ  di Mohammed V-Agdal di Rabat, che costituisce il primo esempio di tali studi in Marocco. Questo lavoro Ã¨ stato anche dâ€™impulso per la presentazione di un grosso progetto di ricerca integrato sui geositi e i geomorfositi del Marocco, presentato allâ€™UniversitÃ  di Marrakesh nel Marzo del 2005, orientato a sostenere la crescita di una economia turistica basata sui principi dello sviluppo sostenibile, che potrÃ  consentire di attivare programmi e progetti capaci di far interagire sinergicamente le georisorse di cui le aree collinari (Rift, Gharb, ecc.) e montane dellâ€™interno (Medio Atlante, Alto Atlante, Anti Atlante) sono particolarmente dotate, ai fini del rafforzamento della crescita economica, della gestione consapevole delle risorse del territorio e della realizzazione di iniziative e progetti innovativi di turismo sostenibile. Inquadramento geografico e geologico Il territorio oggetto della presente ricerca Ã¨ conosciuto come Medio Atlante, si estende a Sud delle cittÃ  imperiali di MeknÃ¨s e di FÃ¨s e comprende i centri abitati di El Hajeb, Azrou, Ifrane, Sefrou, Ain Leuh e Timahdite per una superficie totale di oltre 120 kmq. Nellâ€™area affiorano rocce di varia natura (sedimentarie, metamorfiche e vulcaniche) che coprono un lasso di tempo che va dal Siluriano al Quaternario recente (Michard, 1976; Martin, 1981; PiquÃ©, 1994). Le rocce piÃ¹ antiche coprono una vasta porzione del territorio ad occidente della strada che collega i centri di El Hajeb e Azrou in una grande finestra dâ€™erosione, osservabile dal noto Balcon dâ€™Ito, questâ€™ultima meta di turisti per lâ€™ampio e vario panorama che offre. Le sequenze paleozoiche sono composte sia da litologie tenere (essenzialmente scisti) sia da quelle dure (marmi, arenarie e quarziti), intensamente piegate secondo direzioni tipicamente erciniche NE-SW. Questo basamento paleozoico Ã¨ coperto da argille rosse e basalti doleritici molto alterati del Trias superiore (PiquÃ©, Laville, 1995), seguito dai termini carbonatici giurassico-cretacei (dolomie e calcari) delle cosiddette â€œCaussesâ€ (Colo, 1964; Martin, 1981). Durante il Terziario il territorio si trova prevalentemente emerso ad eccezione di alcune trasgressioni che hanno lasciato dei calcari fossiliferi eocenici nei dintorni di Timahdite. Una notevole impronta sul paesaggio Ã¨ stato lasciato dallâ€™attivitÃ  vulcanica pleistocenica del Plateau dâ€™Azrou (Harmand et al., 1984; 1986) e dalle formazioni travertinose Plio-Quaternarie particolarmente importanti sui bordi delle Causses. Metodi La metodologia d'indagine utilizzata rispecchia quella ampiamente sperimentato nel corso di alcuni progetti di ricerca nazionali sul patrimonio geologico e geomorfologico ed il geoturismo in Italia (COFIN 2001-2003 e COFIN 2004-2006) ed in modo particolare nellâ€™ambito di un Progetto di cooperazione con i Paesi in Via di Sviluppo (PVS, L.R. Sardegna 19/1996) con lâ€™Istitut des RÃ©gions Arides di Medenine (Tunisia), svoltosi nellâ€™area desertica di Tozeur nel Sud Tunisino (Di Gregorio et al., 2003; De Waele et al., 2005). La metodologia adoperata comprende la consultazione di dati da fonti bibliografiche e cartografiche e la loro integrazione mediante indagini specialistiche (rilevamenti in campo, foto-interpretazione di riprese aeree, analisi di immagini satellitari). Lâ€™elaborazione dei dati raccolti ha consentito di compilare delle schede informatizzate e delle Carte tematiche che illustrano la tipologia, la consistenza, lâ€™importanza a scala geografica e la distribuzione di tali beni ai fini della predisposizione di percorsi attrezzati per la fruizione e di adeguate iniziative di tutela e conservazione.

Feature selection for pattern recognition by LASSO and thresholding methods - a comparison,"For high-dimensional data processing, like pattern recognition, it seems desirable to precede with a reduction of the number of describing features. Our aim is a comparison of various feature selection methods for pattern recognition. We consider two-class supervised classification problem for signals decomposed in wavelet bases. We test kNN classification rule with soft and hard thresholding, performed in two stages: (1) wavelet detail coefficient thresholding (noise reduction) and (2) searching for the most differentiating coefficients between classes (selection of discriminating coefficients). We present a new classification rule based on LARS/LASSO. We compare criteria for L1-norm regularization of wavelet coefficients: AIC, BIC and the thresh derived for kNN rule. There were performed simulations for noisy signals with SNR in the range from 0 to 22 [dB], approximated for all possible wavelet resolutions. The quality of pattern recognition for the presented algorithms was measured by the estimated recognition risk and the size of reduced model.",2011,2011 16th International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics
Group LASSO with Asymmetric Structure Estimation for Multi-Task Learning,"Group LASSO is a widely used regularization that imposes sparsity considering groups of covariates. When used in Multi-Task Learning (MTL) formulations, it makes an underlying assumption that if one group of covariates is not relevant for one or a few tasks, it is also not relevant for all tasks, thus implicitly assuming that all tasks are related. This implication can easily lead to negative transfer if this assumption does not hold for all tasks. Since for most practical applications we hardly know a priori how the tasks are related, several approaches have been conceived in the literature to (i) properly capture the transference structure, (ii) improve interpretability of the tasks interplay, and (iii) penalize potential negative transfer. Recently, the automatic estimation of asymmetric structures inside the learning process was capable of effectively avoiding negative transfer. Our proposal is the first attempt in the literature to conceive a Group LASSO with asymmetric transference formulation, looking for the best of both worlds in a framework that admits the overlap of groups. The resulting optimization problem is solved by an alternating procedure with fast methods. We performed experiments using synthetic and real datasets to compare our proposal with state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the promising predictive performance and distinguished interpretability of our proposal. The real case study involves the prediction of cognitive scores for Alzheimerâ€™s disease progression assessment. The source codes are available at GitHub.",2019,
Robust Localization Exploiting Sparse Residuals,"We consider a wireless sensor network (WSN) that employs ultra-wideband impulse radio (UWB-IR) to locate a target. This can be done using the two-way ranging protocol (TWR). It can be shown that when using TWR, the localization problem can be linearized. The range measurements between the sensor nodes and the anchors are not assumed reliable, however. A way to deal with the presence of a small number of incorrect measurements is to use a robust estimator such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) or sparse residuals, instead of a least squares estimator. It is demonstrated that using a robust estimator can significantly improve the quality of the localization, provided that the number of incorrect measurements is small.",2012,
Modeling double time-scale travel time processes with application to assessing the resilience of transportation systems,"Abstract This paper proposes a double time-scale model to capture the day-to-day evolution along with the within-day variability of travel time. The proposed model can be used to evaluate short-term to long-term effects of new transport policies and construction of critical infrastructures, and to analyze the resilience of road networks under disruptions. The within-day travel time variability is modeled using the functional data analysis, in which the effects of road traffic congestion and noise of traffic data are considered explicitly. The within-day process is then regarded as the local volatility (or the noise process) to drive the day-to-day process while the latter is described by a modified geometric Brownian motion (GBM). Then, the day-to-day travel time process is obtained by the statistics of the modified GBM. The model probabilistically captures the evolution of day-to-day and within-day travel time processes analytically. Moreover, an efficient method based on the cross-entropy method is developed for calibrating the model parameters. A lasso-like regularization is employed to guarantee a small bias between the model estimations and the measurement counterparts. Finally, two empirical studies are carried out to validate the proposed model at different scales with different traffic scenarios, i.e., a case study on the Guangzhou Airport Expressway (link to path scale) under traffic accident conditions and a case study in New York City (city-scale) to analyze the network resilience under Hurricane Sandy. Both case studies adopted probe vehicle data but with different configurations (fine versus coarse, small versus big data). The empirical studies confirm that the proposed model can accommodate the inherent variability in traffic conditions and data meanwhile being computationally tractable. The numerical results illustrate the applicability of the proposed model as a powerful tool in practice for analyzing the short-term and long-term impacts of disruptions and systematic changes in the performance of road networks.",2019,Transportation Research Part B-methodological
Sleep disturbances and their coâ€‘occurrence with emotional and behavioural problems in elementary school children,"Sleep disturbances are likely to be associated with emotional and behavioural problems in children. The goal was to evaluate co-occurrences between sleep disturbances and behavioural and emotional problems in elementary school children by means of network analysis. The study was performed in St. Petersburg in 2017 and comprised 186 typically developing children (92 boys, 94 girls) aged 6 to 8 (median 7) years. The mothers were requested to fill in the Child Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ) aimed to measure certain sleep troubles in children. The teachers were approached with the Achenbach Teacher Report Form for Ages 6â€“18 years aimed to find major emotional and behavioural disturbances. The EBICglasso (Extended Bayesian Information Criterion graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) algorithm was used to estimate a regularized graphical model and to find the most important associations. There were 14 nodes in the network with 26 non-zero edges. Some variables had strong connections. The daytime sleepiness scale had the highest betweenness score (normalized value 2.54), and it bridged sleep problems and the signs of emotional/behavioural disturbances. Other variables with high betweenness scores were parasomnias (normalized value 1.14), acting as the bridge that connects other features of sleep problems, and depressive problems (normalized value 1.46), bridging the nodes related to emotional/behavioural disturbances. These clinical signs may play important roles in the network and should be regarded cautiously as possible indicators of co-occurring sleep and emotional disturbances. Network analysis offers the potential for insight into structural relationships among core psychological processes related to sleep disturbances in children.",2019,Somnologie
Intraoperative Hepatic Blood Inflow Can Predict Early Acute Kidney Injury following DCD Liver Transplantation: A Retrospective Observational Study,"Purpose
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major and severe complication following donation-after-circulatory-death (DCD) liver transplantation (LT) and is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. However, the risk factors and the prognosis factors of AKI still need to be further explored, and the relativity of intraoperative hepatic blood inflow (HBI) and AKI following LT has not been discussed yet. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between HBI and AKI and to construct a prediction model of early acute kidney injury (EAKI) following DCD LT with the combination of HBI and other clinical parameters.


Methods
Clinical data of 132 patients who underwent DCD liver transplantation at the first hospital of China Medical University from April 2005 to March 2017 were analyzed. Data of 105 patients (the first ten years of patients) were used to develop the prediction model. Then we assessed the clinical usefulness of the prediction models in the validation cohort (27 patients). EAKI according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria based on serum creatinine increase during 7-day of postoperative follow-up.


Results
After Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and simplification, a simplified prediction model consisting of the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score (p=0.033), anhepatic phase (p=0.014), packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion (p=0.027), and the HBI indexed by height (HBI/h) (p=0.002) was established. The C-indexes of the model in the development and validation cohort were 0.823 [95% CI, 0.738-0.908] and 0.921 [95% CI, 0.816-1.000], respectively.


Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated the utility of HBI/h as a predictor for EAKI following DCD LT, as well as the clinical usefulness of the prediction model through the combination of the CTP score, anhepatic phase, pRBC transfusion and HBI/h.",2019,BioMed Research International
"Prevalence of ticks infesting grasscutters (Thryonomys swinderianus Temminck, 1827) in the south of CÃ´te d'Ivoire","Objective : Ticks play a significant role in the transmission of pathogenic agents to animals. In Cote d'Ivoire,Â there is little information on those of grasscutters. Methodology and results: Thus, 150 wild grasscutters and 150 farm grasscutters from the south of CoteÂ d'Ivoire were examined from April 2010 to October 2012. Ticks collected were identified under binocularÂ lens and optical microscope. The species identified were confirmed at CIRDES (Bobo-Dioulasso). TheÂ species Ixodes aulacodi, Rhipicephalus sim psoni, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, AmblyommaÂ compressum and Haemaphysalis leachi were identified. Farm grasscutters were not infested but 92% ofÂ wild grasscutters were infested by at least one species. The most abundant species was I. aulacodi. ItÂ accounted for 67.98% of all collected ticks and was encountered on 75.33% of wild grasscutters. TheÂ second one was R. simpsoni (29.11% of collected ticks and collected on 54% of wild grasscutters). TheÂ three other species were slightly encountered (less than 2% of collected ticks and prevalence lower thanÂ 7%). Similarly, the infestation level by I. aulacodi was the highest (7Â±5 ticks per grasscutter against lessÂ than 4 for the others).Ticks belonging to R. simpsoni, R. microplus and Ha. leachi were adults. On the otherÂ hand, 9.16% of I. aulacodi and 25% of A. compressum were nymphs. Conclusion and application of results : Farm grasscutters in Cote d'Ivoire do not carry some ticks. But fiveÂ species were found on wild grasscutters. Ticks and pathogenic agents that they transmit and for whichÂ some are responsible for zoonosis, could constitute a major obstacle for the development of grasscuttersâ€™Â farming and constitute a problem of public health. This study gives an update on diversity and databaseÂ information for surveillance and prevention of zoonosis and their vectors.

[Epidemiological situation of yellow fever in Burkina Faso from 2003 to 2008].,"Despite the existence of antiamaril vaccine in the routine Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) in Burkina Faso, yellow fever cases still occur in the country. In collaboration with WHO, the national health authorities set up a surveillance system through the national reference laboratory in Centre Muraz (Bobo-Dioulasso). All samples of feverish icterus cases of the 63 health districts of the country were analysed in this lab for M Immunoglobulin using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Elisa). Positive Elisa samples were sent to Pasteur Institute of Dakar (Senegal) for confirmation using a Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay. From 2003 to 2005, the number of confirmed cases of yellow fever was respectively of 1/413 (0.24%), 14/616 (2.27%) and 19/618 (3.07%). This increasing of the proportion was statistical different. Then, from 2006 to 2008, the confirmed case proportion was respectively 0.35%, 0.27 and 0.54% without significant difference (P = 0.69). The entomological investigations conducted in 2004 in Bobo-Dioulasso showed that the water pots constitute 48.11% mosquitoes lodgings, followed by metal drums with a strong representation of Culex quinquefasciatus (48.7%), followed by Aedes aegypti (43.3%), as vectors in domestic areas with sectorial variations. These results suggest that more attention must be paid by the national health authorities and international community regarding this disease.",2010,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique
Identifying incident dementia by applying machine learning to a very large administrative claims dataset,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are highly prevalent conditions, and prior efforts to develop predictive models have relied on demographic and clinical risk factors using traditional logistical regression methods. We hypothesized that machine-learning algorithms using administrative claims data may represent a novel approach to predicting ADRD. Using a national de-identified dataset of more than 125 million patients including over 10,000 clinical, pharmaceutical, and demographic variables, we developed a cohort to train a machine learning model to predict ADRD 4-5 years in advance. The Lasso algorithm selected a 50-variable model with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.693. Top diagnosis codes in the model were memory loss (780.93), Parkinson's disease (332.0), mild cognitive impairment (331.83) and bipolar disorder (296.80), and top pharmacy codes were psychoactive drugs. Machine learning algorithms can rapidly develop predictive models for ADRD with massive datasets, without requiring hypothesis-driven feature engineering.",2019,PLoS ONE
"Late Cretaceous paleoclimate change and its impact on uranium mineralization in the Kailu Depression, southwest Songliao Basin","Abstract Paleoclimate significantly influenced continental sandstone-type uranium mineralization. To better reveal the Late Cretaceous continental climate change and its influence on uranium mineralization, the Late Cretaceous sedimentary successions of four boreholes drilled in the southwest of Songliao Basin, Northeast China, were selected, and 21 samples were collected for sporopollen analysis. Based on the variations in the relative abundances of different sporopollen taxa, the following four palynological assemblages (PAs) have been recognized in ascending order: the Schizaeoisporitesâ€“Classopollisâ€“Tricolporollenites assemblage, the Taxodiaceaepollenitesâ€“Exesipollentiesâ€“Cranwellia assemblage, the Schizaeoisporitesâ€“Classopollisâ€“Lytharites assemblage and the Biasccateâ€“Taxodiaceaepollenitesâ€“Aquilapollenites assemblage. The geologic era of four PAs was assigned to late Turonian to early Campanian (about 86.7â€“84.4Ma) according to the geological range of some important elements and the correlation with relevant assemblages of other areas. In this paper, we introduced a sporopollenâ€“climate transforming methodology, which used the percentage of drought taxa, hygrophilous taxa, and thermophilic taxa to indicate humidity and temperature stratigraphic trends. On the one hand, the percentage of thermophilic taxa presented a continuous decreasing trend but remained a relative high abundance along the whole sedimentary sequence. This was indicative of a hot subtropical-tropical climate with declining temperature. On the other hand, the percentage of drought taxa and hygrophilous taxa exhibited cyclical fluctuations between humid and semi-arid climates. A semi-arid climate existed in PA I, then the climate changed into humid conditions in PA II. Subsequently, the climate has evolved into semi-arid, semi-humid conditions as result of the strengthened drought in PA III. Finally, the climate became humid once more in PA IV. Generally, the synsedimentary paleoclimate of Yaojia Formation (which equates to the PA II and PA III) was mainly semi-humid conditions. Moreover, the main prospect target layer was Yaojia Formation in the Qianjiadian area. Comparison with the typical sandstone-type uranium deposits in North China, we inferred that the humid paleoclimate was an essential conditions for uranium mineralization, because the humid climate was favorable for the formation of reduced sandstones, providing significant geochemical reducing barriers and pre-concentration of uranium for the epigenetic uranium mineralization.",2019,Ore Geology Reviews
Restarting accelerated gradient methods with a rough strong convexity estimate,"We propose new restarting strategies for accelerated gradient and accelerated coordinate descent methods. Our main contribution is to show that the restarted method has a geometric rate of convergence for any restarting frequency, and so it allows us to take profit of restarting even when we do not know the strong convexity coefficient. The scheme can be combined with adaptive restarting, leading to the first provable convergence for adaptive restarting schemes with accelerated gradient methods. Finally, we illustrate the properties of the algorithm on a regularized logistic regression problem and on a Lasso problem.",2016,arXiv: Optimization and Control
The mid-fourteenth century capital of Mali,"For over a century scholars have been attempting to locate the area and, if possible, the actual site of the capital of the Mali empire in its period of greatness. Since the 1920S attention has been focused on an area near the Sankararni river, a tributary entering the Niger from the south, upstream from Bamako. Over recent years a Polish-Guinean archaeological expedition has been digging a site there, but with inconclusive results so far. A close reading of the few descriptions we have of the capital of Mali, and in particular of the route taken by Ibn BattÅ«ta, who visited the capital in 1352, suggests that the city lay on the left bank of the river Niger somewhere between Segu and Bamako. This is in fact a â€˜logical] site for the capital of an empire whose tributaries lay mainly in the savannah and Sahel belts, and in whose armies cavalry played a significant role. For this reason, and a number of others, the recent hypothesis of Claude Meillassoux, suggesting a location for the capital south of the R. Faleme (and perhaps also of the R. Gambia), seems doubtful. The proper name for the capital is also discussed.",1973,The Journal of African History
Forecasting Road Surface Temperature in Beijing Based on Machine Learning Algorithms,"With the influence of extreme weather, road surface temperature (RST), which threatens the safety of people's travel, has attracted more and more attention to the government and citizens. However, traditional methods are hard to meet real-time requirements in forecasting RST. In order to improve the predictive accuracy of RST and meet the real-time requirement, this paper compares three different machine learning algorithms including, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT). Using the RST data and BJ-RUC (Beijing-rapidly update cycle) data during November 2012 and June 2015, the performance of three models is evaluated. The experimental results show that GBRT performs the best and its MSE is 6.7853.",2018,
Bayes Shrinkage at GWAS scale: Convergence and Approximation Theory of a Scalable MCMC Algorithm for the Horseshoe Prior,"The horseshoe prior is frequently employed in Bayesian analysis of high-dimensional models, and has been shown to achieve minimax optimal risk properties when the truth is sparse. While optimization-based algorithms for the extremely popular Lasso and elastic net procedures can scale to dimension in the hundreds of thousands, algorithms for the horseshoe that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for computation are limited to problems an order of magnitude smaller. This is due to high computational cost per step and growth of the variance of time-averaging estimators as a function of dimension. We propose two new MCMC algorithms for computation in these models that have improved performance compared to existing alternatives. One of the algorithms also approximates an expensive matrix product to give orders of magnitude speedup in high-dimensional applications. We prove that the exact algorithm is geometrically ergodic, and give guarantees for the accuracy of the approximate algorithm using perturbation theory. Versions of the approximation algorithm that gradually decrease the approximation error as the chain extends are shown to be exact. The scalability of the algorithm is illustrated in simulations with problem size as large as $N=5,000$ observations and $p=50,000$ predictors, and an application to a genome-wide association study with $N=2,267$ and $p=98,385$. The empirical results also show that the new algorithm yields estimates with lower mean squared error, intervals with better coverage, and elucidates features of the posterior that were often missed by previous algorithms in high dimensions, including bimodality of posterior marginals indicating uncertainty about which covariates belong in the model.",2017,arXiv: Computation
Curatorial futures with the image: Overcoming scepticism and unbinding the relational,"ABSTRACTA standard comprehension of curatorial practice is conditioned upon the organizing of relations between objects and meaning, between art and its perception and between objects and other objects. A widespread tendency established in a culture of critique in art and curatorial practice responds to this primacy of the organizational by retreating from it by producing â€˜open frameworks of interactionâ€™ in the hope that this naturalism will secure itself away from what it sees to be problematic instrumentalism of the image. This attitude is underscored, moreover, in practices where the horror of a conscious inability to make this retreat is further standardized in ironic forms of production that correlate a theory of constraint to the materialities of economic dominance. This article argues that both these responses to meaning meet at the same terminus, impoverishing the image and its potential. Looking to and setting out some further problems within Quentin Meillassoux's speculative materialism, this te...",2010,Journal of Visual Art Practice
Tropical seagrass fish assemblage composition : importance of edge effect and seascape context,"In this study, variations in fish assemblage composition were studied with a unique combination of multiple spatial scales and detailed in situ measurements as well as a comparison of interiors and edges of Thalassodendron ciliatum seagrass beds in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Findings successfully show how different fish response variables vary on different spatial scales. The variables included abundance of adult and juvenile fish, fish species diversity, species composition and size distribution. Predictors included seagrass structural complexity, habitat configuration in the bedsâ€™ edges and large-scale seascape configuration using satellite images. Juvenile fish and fish species diversity increased with structural complexity of interiors of T. ciliatum beds. Further, habitat configuration in the edges of T. ciliatum beds, especially coral habitat and overall heterogeneity of habitats, affected adult fish abundance and fish species diversity positively in the edges of beds, likely due to adultsâ€™ larger home ranges and/or more complex migratory habits compared to juvenile fish. Seascape configuration affected fish assemblages via its ability to affect overall connectivity in the seascape, where distance between land and deep water is short; adult fish are more abundant compared to large shallow areas with large continuous habitat patches. Multivariate analyses of species composition are well in line with results from abundance and diversity. With a unique combination of width in spatial scales and detail in measurements, this study has improved the understanding of what is determining fish assemblage composition. Furthermore, the study yields a holistic view and has a high degree of general applicability, making it interesting for further development, and potentially useful for research as well as local management.",2013,
Encoding sparse and competitive structures among tasks in multi-task learning,"Abstract Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to enhance generalization performance by exploring the inherent structures across tasks. Most existing MTL methods are based on the assumption that the tasks are positively correlated, and utilize the shared structures among tasks to improve learning performance. By contrast, there also exist competitive structure (negative relationships) among tasks in some real-world applications, and conventional MTL methods which explore shared structures across tasks may lead to unsatisfactory performance in this setting. Another challenge, especially in a high dimensional setting, is to exclude irrelevant features (sparse structure) from the final model. For this purpose, this work propose a new method, which is referred to as Sparse Exclusive Lasso (SpEL) for multi-task learning. The proposed SpEL is able to capture the competitive relationship among tasks (competitive structure), while remove unimportant features which are common across the tasks from the final model (sparse structure). Experimental studies on synthetic and real data indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve learning performance by identifying sparse and task-competitive structures simultaneously.",2019,Pattern Recognit.
Is trypanocidal drug resistance a threat for livestock health and production in endemic areas? Food for thoughts from Sahelian goats infected by Trypanosoma vivax in Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso).,"Trypanocidal drug resistance is unanimously recognized as a threat for livestock production in regions where the prevalence of trypanosomosis is high. To assess the impact of the disease and the effect of drug resistance on the health of small ruminants, twelve Trypanosoma vivax isolates collected in 6 villages in the vicinity of Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) were injected into 12 groups of 5 Sahelian goats, two being treated with 3.5mg/kg body weight diminazene aceturate (DA), two with 0.5mg/kg body weight isometamidium chloride (ISM) and one left untreated as control. A monitoring was performed every 5 days for 100 days to evaluate the parasitaemia by buffy coat examination, the hematocrit and the body weight. Among the 12 groups, 6 were additionally monitored using a trypanosome specific 18S-PCR-RFLP every 5 days from day 30 to day 100 to verify the complete clearance of the parasites from the blood of the hosts. In six groups of goats, trypanosomes disappeared completely after treatment, five groups showed relapses in at least one goat treated with ISM and one group showed relapses in one goat treated with DA and one with ISM. For the 6 groups that were screened both using microscopic examination and trypanosome specific 18S-PCR-RFLP, the following results were observed: for the groups treated with DA, no relapses by microscopic examination and 83.3% (10/12) using the 18S-PCR-RFLP. For the groups treated with ISM, 25% (3/12) relapses by microscopic examination and 83.3% with the 18S-PCR-RFLP (10/12). The evolution of the PCV and the weight during the observation period from relapsing (either by microscopical examination or by 18S-PCR-RFLP diagnosis) and non relapsing animals were compared. The relative average PCV in goats that relapsed microscopically, decreased significantly more than in non-relapsing goats. This difference was not significant when relapses were detected using the trypanosome specific 18S-PCR-RFLP. This indicates that only the animals with the highest parasitaemia suffered from the infection. Relapses after treatment where the host controls the parasitaemia to a level below the sensitivity of the microscopical examination do not affect body weight nor PCV.",2012,Veterinary parasitology
Sparse Multiperiod Group Lasso for Bearing Multifault Diagnosis,"Bearing fault diagnosis is becoming more and more important for current rotating machinery. How to extract bearing fault signals submerged by heavy background noise is still a challenging problem, especially in the case of multiple faults coupled with each other. In this paper, a novel multifault model called sparse multiperiod group lasso (SMPGL) is proposed to extract the fault feature of every single fault from multifault signals based on the sparsity within and across groups (SWAG) property and the separably periodic prior. Moreover, a fast algorithm is deduced based on the majorizationâ€“minimization (MM) algorithm for solving the proposed multifault model and its convergence condition is also analyzed. We investigate the parameter selection thoroughly and provide a deterministic rule for the parameter selection of SMPGL. The main advantages of the proposed method are that users can set the number of compound faults freely, the algorithm is very fast, and parameters are set adaptively. The effectiveness and robustness of SMPGL are verified by simulation studies and two experiment cases. Furthermore, the comparison study shows that the proposed SMPGL method gives more satisfying results than other state-of-the-art methods, including the L1-based method and spectral kurtosis (SK).",2020,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement
Parameter estimation for high dimensional change point regression models without grid search,"We propose an L1 regularized estimator for the parameters of a high dimensional change point regression model and provide the corresponding rates of convergence for the regression as well change point estimates. Importantly, the computational cost of our estimator is 2Lasso(n,p), where Lasso(n,p) represents the computational burden of one Lasso optimization. In comparison, existing grid search based approaches to this problem require a computational cost of at least nLasso(n,p) optimizations. We work under a subgaussian random design where the underlying assumptions in our study are milder than those currently assumed in the high dimensional change point regression literature. We allow the true change point parameter $\tau_{0n}$ to possibly move to the boundaries of its parametric space, and the jump size $\|\beta_0-\gamma_0\|_2$ to possibly diverge as $n$ increases. We also characterize the corresponding effects of these quantities on the rates of convergence of the regression and change point estimates. Simulations are performed to empirically evaluate performance of the proposed estimators. The methodology is applied to community level socio-economic data of the U.S., collected from the 1990 U.S. census and other sources.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Structured sparsity regularization approach to the EEG inverse problem,"Localization of brain activity involves solving the EEG inverse problem, which is an undetermined ill-posed problem.

We use proximal splitting optimization methods, which are efficient optimization techniques, with good convergence rates and with the ability to handle large nonsmooth convex problems, which is the typical scenario in the EEG inverse problem. We have evaluated our approach under a simulated scenario, consisting in estimating a synthetic BES matrix with 5124 sources.

Penalized estimation in large-scale generalized linear array models,"Large-scale generalized linear array models (GLAMs) can be challenging to fit. Computation and storage of its tensor product design matrix can be impossible due to time and memory constraints, and previously considered design matrix free algorithms do not scale well with the dimension of the parameter vector. A new design matrix free algorithm is proposed for computing the penalized maximum likelihood estimate for GLAMs, which, in particular, handles nondifferentiable penalty functions. The proposed algorithm is implemented and available via the R package \verb+glamlasso+. It combines several ideas -- previously considered separately -- to obtain sparse estimates while at the same time efficiently exploiting the GLAM structure.

Connectivity-based parcellation of putamen region using resting state fMRI,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown great potential in studying the underlying neural systems. Functional connectivity measured by fMRI provides an efficient approach to study the interactions and relationships between different brain regions. However, functional connectivity studies require accurate definition of brain regions, which is often difficult and may not be achieved through anatomical landmarks. In this thesis, we present a novel framework for parcellation of a brain region into functional subunits based on their connectivity patterns with other reference brain regions. The proposed method takes the prior neurological information into consideration and aims at finding spatially continuous and functionally consistent subregions in a given brain region. The proposed framework relies on a sparse spatially regularized fused lasso regression model for feature extraction. The usual lasso model is a linear regression model commonly applied in high dimensional data such as fMRI signals. Compared with lasso, the proposed model further considers the spatial order of each voxel and thus encourages spatially and functionally adjacent voxels to share similar regression coefficients despite of the possible spatial noise. In order to achieve the accurate parcellation results, we propose a process by iteratively merging voxels (groups) and tuning the parameters adaptively. In addition, a Graph-Cut optimization algorithm is adopted for assigning the overlapped voxels into separate sub-regions. With spatial information incorporated, spatially continuous and functionally consistent subunits can be obtained which are desired for subsequent brain connectivity analysis. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method could reliably",2015,
Certifiably Optimal Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation,"We consider the maximum likelihood estimation of sparse inverse covariance matrices. We demonstrate that current heuristic approaches primarily encourage robustness, instead of the desired sparsity. We give a novel approach that solves the cardinality constrained likelihood problem to certifiable optimality. The approach uses techniques from mixed-integer optimization and convex optimization, and provides a high-quality solution with a guarantee on its suboptimality, even if the algorithm is terminated early. Using a variety of synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can solve problems where the dimension of the inverse covariance matrix is up to 1,000s. We also demonstrate that our approach produces significantly sparser solutions than Glasso and other popular learning procedures, makes less false discoveries, while still maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.",2019,ArXiv
Automatic discovery of 100-miRNA signature for cancer classification using ensemble feature selection,"BackgroundMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules heavily involved in human tumors, in which few of them circulating the human body. Finding a tumor-associated signature of miRNA, that is, the minimum miRNA entities to be measured for discriminating both different types of cancer and normal tissues, is of utmost importance. Feature selection techniques applied in machine learning can help however they often provide naive or biased results.ResultsAn ensemble feature selection strategy for miRNA signatures is proposed. miRNAs are chosen based on consensus on feature relevance from high-accuracy classifiers of different typologies. This methodology aims to identify signatures that are considerably more robust and reliable when used in clinically relevant prediction tasks. Using the proposed method, a 100-miRNA signature is identified in a dataset of 8023 samples, extracted from TCGA. When running eight-state-of-the-art classifiers along with the 100-miRNA signature against the original 1046 features, it could be detected that global accuracy differs only by 1.4%. Importantly, this 100-miRNA signature is sufficient to distinguish between tumor and normal tissues. The approach is then compared against other feature selection methods, such as UFS, RFE, EN, LASSO, Genetic Algorithms, and EFS-CLA. The proposed approach provides better accuracy when tested on a 10-fold cross-validation with different classifiers and it is applied to several GEO datasets across different platforms with some classifiers showing more than 90% classification accuracy, which proves its cross-platform applicability.ConclusionsThe 100-miRNA signature is sufficiently stable to provide almost the same classification accuracy as the complete TCGA dataset, and it is further validated on several GEO datasets, across different types of cancer and platforms. Furthermore, a bibliographic analysis confirms that 77 out of the 100 miRNAs in the signature appear in lists of circulating miRNAs used in cancer studies, in stem-loop or mature-sequence form. The remaining 23 miRNAs offer potentially promising avenues for future research.",2019,BMC Bioinformatics
Medical Tumor Image Classification Algorithm and Its Application in Breast Cancer,"Medical image classification of tumors plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of medical diseases. With the development of computer science and technology, medical imaging has made great progress in imaging, image acquisition speed is getting faster and faster, and image resolution is getting higher and higher. However, the interpretation of images mainly comes from imaging doctors. On the one hand, the quantity and quality of images greatly increase their burden. On the other hand, their interpretation of images mainly depends on the image characteristics that can be observed by the naked eye, which inevitably will be affected by subjective factors such as personal experience. Based on the clinical needs, this paper first uses image enhancement algorithm to extract image features, and then introduces medical tumor image classification. Finally, the paper elaborates the designed medical image classification network S-Dense Net. In this paper, the images are evaluated from subjective and objective aspects. The experimental results show that S-Dense Net has higher accuracy and AUC (Area under Curve) values than traditional algorithms including Logistic regression, LASSO logistic regression, SVM and random forest and based on Google Net, ResNet-51, and Squeeze Net network algorithms.",2019,Investigacion Clinica
Evidence of behaviour change following a hygiene promotion programme in Burkina Faso.,"OBJECTIVES
To determine whether a large, 3-year hygiene promotion programme in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, was effective in changing behaviours associated with the spread of diarrhoeal diseases. The programme was tailored to local customs, targeted specific types of behaviour, built on existing motivation for hygiene, and used locally appropriate channels of communication.


METHODS
Two population surveys recorded the coverage of the programme among target audiences (mothers of children aged 0-35 months). Four surveys were carried out: three prior to the programme and one in 1998 (after the programme had been running for 3 years), using structured observation of hygiene behaviours in the participants' homes to document changes in target behaviours.


FINDINGS
After the programme had run for 3 years, three-quarters of the mothers targeted had had contact with programme activities. Half could cite the two main messages of the programme correctly. Although the safe disposal of children's stools changed little between 1995 and 1998 (80% pre-intervention, 84% post-intervention), hand-washing with soap after cleaning a child's bottom rose from 13% to 31%. The proportion of mothers who washed their hands with soap after using the latrine increased from 1% to 17%.


CONCLUSION
Hygiene promotion programmes can change behaviour and are more likely to be effective if they are built on local research and use locally appropriate channels of communication repeatedly and for an extended time.",2001,Bulletin of the World Health Organization
Software tool for solving inductive modelling tasks based on self-organizing combinatorial-genetic method,"The article presents results of application of the software package based on self-organizing combinatorial-genetic algorithm COMBI-GA for inductive construction of optimal models from observation data under incomplete information about an object and investigating the capabilities of the algorithm, in particular, for solving large dimensional problems. Characteristics and capabilities of the software package built on the basis of this algorithm are considered. The analysis of the COMBI-GA effectiveness in the sense of the restoration accuracy of a given test model and the time to find it was carried out in comparison with the LASSO algorithm as well as with the sorting-out GMDH algorithms COMBI and MULTI. It is shown that all algorithms find the correct models but COMBI-GA does it much faster.",2019,2019 IEEE 14th International Conference on Computer Sciences and Information Technologies (CSIT)
Double-estimation-friendly inference for high-dimensional misspecified models,"All models may be wrong---but that is not necessarily a problem for inference. Consider the standard $t$-test for the significance of a variable $X$ for predicting response $Y$ whilst controlling for $p$ other covariates $Z$ in a random design linear model. This yields correct asymptotic type~I error control for the null hypothesis that $X$ is conditionally independent of $Y$ given $Z$ under an \emph{arbitrary} regression model of $Y$ on $(X, Z)$, provided that a linear regression model for $X$ on $Z$ holds. An analogous robustness to misspecification, which we term the ""double-estimation-friendly"" (DEF) property, also holds for Wald tests in generalised linear models, with some small modifications. 
In this expository paper we explore this phenomenon, and propose methodology for high-dimensional regression settings that respects the DEF property. We advocate specifying (sparse) generalised linear regression models for both $Y$ and the covariate of interest $X$; our framework gives valid inference for the conditional independence null if either of these hold. In the special case where both specifications are linear, our proposal amounts to a small modification of the popular debiased Lasso test. We also investigate constructing confidence intervals for the regression coefficient of $X$ via inverting our tests; these have coverage guarantees even in partially linear models where the contribution of $Z$ to $Y$ can be arbitrary. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Distribution-free uncertainty quantification for kernel methods by gradient perturbations,"We propose a data-driven approach to quantify the uncertainty of models constructed by kernel methods. Our approach minimizes the needed distributional assumptions, hence, instead of working with, for example, Gaussian processes or exponential families, it only requires knowledge about some mild regularity of the measurement noise, such as it is being symmetric or exchangeable. We show, by building on recent results from finite-sample system identification, that by perturbing the residuals in the gradient of the objective function, information can be extracted about the amount of uncertainty our model has. Particularly, we provide an algorithm to build exact, non-asymptotically guaranteed, distribution-free confidence regions for ideal, noise-free representations of the function we try to estimate. For the typical convex quadratic problems and symmetric noises, the regions are star convex centered around a given nominal estimate, and have efficient ellipsoidal outer approximations. Finally, we illustrate the ideas on typical kernel methods, such as LS-SVC, KRR, $$\varepsilon $$Îµ-SVR and kernelized LASSO.",2019,Machine Learning
Design of an intention signal in the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum),"The â€˜designâ€™ of any animal signal is affected by at least three selection pressures: (i) the type of information being conveyed (the message); (ii) the transmission properties of the medium; and (iii) the sensory and psychological properties of the receiver. We describe a field study of the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) and examine the â€˜circlingâ€™ display of the male in the light of these three pressures. Analysis of videotape records of the display shows that it carries accurate information about when a spawning dash will occur. The speed with which the pectoral fins are moved increases steadily over the 10 s before spawning so that the exact time of spawning can be predicted. Dark spots (not present when the male is chasing other males) appear on the ends of the pectoral fins and may 'amplifyâ€™ perception of fin movements. The colour change shown by the male when chasing other males and when courting females was measured in situ by using Munsell colour charts, and was subsequently converted to dominant wavelength and excitation purity equivalents. The circling display appears to be designed to convey information about intention to spawn to a female that is relatively close whilst not conveying this information to other males that are further away.",1994,Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Genome-wide association studies using binned genotypes,"Linear mixed models (LMM) that tests trait association one marker at a time have been the most popular methods for genome-wide association studies. However, this approach has potential pitfalls: over conservativeness after Bonferroni correction, ignorance of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between neighboring markers, and power reduction due to overfitting SNP effects. So, multiple locus models that can simultaneously estimate and test all markers in the genome are more appropriate. Based on the multiple locus models, we proposed a bin model that combines markers into bins based on their LD relationships. A bin is treated as a new synthetic marker and we detect the associations between bins and traits. Since the number of bins can be substantially smaller than the number of markers, a penalized multiple regression method can be adopted by fitting all bins to a single model. We developed an innovative method to bin the neighboring markers and used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. We compared BIN-Lasso with SNP-Lasso and Qâ€‰+â€‰K-LMM in a simulation experiment, and showed that the new method is more powerful with less Type I error than the other two methods. We also applied the bin model to a Chinese Simmental beef cattle population for bone weight association study. The new method identified more significant associations than the classical LMM. The bin model is a new dimension reduction technique that takes advantage of biological information (i.e., LD). The new method will be a significant breakthrough in associative genomics in the big data era.",2019,Heredity
Learning structural conjunction of image content by sparse graphical model,"In this paper we present a novel method on learning structural conjunction of image content by sparse graphical model. We first use matrix-variate distributions to formulate two statistical structure models and establish the connection between them. The connection leads us to sparse Gaussian graphical models in which sparse regression technique such as lasso is used for concentration matrix estimation as well as structure learning. Our proposed theoretical framework and structure selection methods provide an approach for exploiting structural conjunction of data. We apply this approach to construction of underlying structural correlation between image content, and demonstrate the effectiveness by solving image jigsaw problem.",2011,2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing
Abstract B1-52: Analysis of the iCOGS breast cancer GWAS reveals 4 unique signals in the PTHLH region in patients of European origin,"Abstracts: AACR Special Conference: Computational and Systems Biology of Cancer; February 8-11, 2015; San Francisco, CA Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), the product of the PTHLH gene, has long been implicated in breast cancer. Its expression is thought to favour and, potentially, facilitate metastasis to bone. Paradoxically, a prospective clinical study clinical suggests that its production in primary breast cancers is actually protective, affording a better prognosis than its absence. Multiple recent Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have confirmed a single susceptibility locus immediately upstream of the PTHLH gene to be associated with breast cancer. This was again reproduced in the recent iCOGS GWAS, which involved over 90,000 European subjects. In spite of a single SNP, rs10771399, being uniquely reported and reproduced by prior studies, we demonstrate 4 discrete overlapping signals by utilising forward selection logistic regression and LASSO techniques. Two of these signals are centred and superimposed around rs10771399, ~40kbp upstream of PTHLH, a third lies a further 100kbp upstream, and the fourth lies a further 250kbp upstream over the next gene, CCDC91. While the causation of this signal remains elusive, multiple putatively contributory variations are captured by these signals. Citation Format: Adam N. Freeman, T John Martin, Michael A.

Using the LASSO for gene selection in bladder cancer data,"Given a gene expression data array of a list of bladder cancer patients with their tumor states, it may be difficult to determine which genes can operate as disease markers when the array is large and possibly contains outliers and missing data. An additional difficulty is that observations (tumor states) in the regression problem are discrete ones. In this article, we solve these problems on concrete data using first a clustering approach, followed by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) estimators in a nonlinear regression problem involving discrete variables, as described in the brand-new research work of Plan and Vershynin. Gene markers of the most severe tumor state are finally provided using the proposed approach.",2015,arXiv: Applications
Adaptively weighted group Lasso for semiparametric quantile regression models,"We propose an adaptively weighted group Lasso procedure for simultaneous variable selection and structure identification for varying coefficient quantile regression models and additive quantile regression models with ultra-high dimensional covariates. Under a strong sparsity condition, we establish selection consistency of the proposed Lasso procedure when the weights therein satisfy a set of general conditions. This consistency result, however, is reliant on a suitable choice of the tuning parameter for the Lasso penalty, which can be hard to make in practice. To alleviate this difficulty, we suggest a BIC-type criterion, which we call high-dimensional information criterion (HDIC), and show that the proposed Lasso procedure with the tuning parameter determined by HDIC still achieves selection consistency. Our simulation studies support strongly our theoretical findings.",2019,Bernoulli
AJAX Widget for Semantic Query Expansion,"We introduce the idea of utilizing ontologies as a service for query expansion, based on an AJAX widget. This ONKI Query Expansion Widget can be integrated into the search input field of a traditional keyword-based legacy system by one line of JavaScript code, making the search system semantic. For example, when searching for â€œtoolsâ€, also â€œhammersâ€, â€œaxesâ€ etc. can be found based on the underlying hyponymy. In the same vein, the spatial relations of a geo-ontology or temporal relations can be utilized. Application of the widget in legacy search systems on the web is discussed by examples. The widget makes it possible to utilize the ontologies of the Finnish Ontology Library Service ONKI in a very cost-efficient way. Query expansion improves information retrieval by expanding the query terms into an union of semantically related terms. To provide a general ontologybased query expansion facility as a ready-to-use service, we took the previously developed ONKI Selector Widget [1] as a starting point. This widget is used for selecting concepts through semantic autocompletion in annotating, but with an extension of less than 100 lines of code it was possible to change the widget into the ONKI Query Expansion Widget. The ONKI Query Expansion Widget can be integrated into web-based systems providing them on-line expansion service of query terms into semantically related concepts. The widget can utilize tens of ontologies published in the ONKI Ontology Library Service by using its JavaScript API, which is implemented with the Direct Web Remoting library. The idea is to provide the query expansion functionality as an easily integrable mash-up service with no need to change the underlying application system. The query widget supports both legacy systems using traditional keywordbased search and Semantic Web systems using semantically disambiguated queries based on URIs. Cross-language search can be performed, if the ontology used is multi-lingual. In addition to the AJAX widget, the query expansion service can also be utilized via JavaScript and Web Service APIs. The widget has been tested with general, domain-specific, and spatio-temporal ontologies. With general and domain-specific ontologies, e.g. the Finnish Collaborative Holistic Ontology KOKO, we have used the transitive is-a relation 1 http://www.yso.fi/ 2 http://directwebremoting.org/ 3 http://www.seco.tkk.fi/ontologies/koko/ (rdfs:subClassOf ) for expanding the query concepts with their subclasses. In case of the Finnish Spatio-temporal ontology SAPO the place names in the query are expanded to regionally overlapping current and historical places. Also other relations could be used for query expansion by adjusting the ontology-specific configuration files of the ONKI Ontology Service as desired. To integrate the ONKI widget into an application the following code is added to the HTML source of the web page. First, the ONKI JavaScript library is loaded into the browser: <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://www.yso.fi/onki.js""></script> Then the input fields on the HTML page can be changed into ONKI widgets by using a parametrized method call in the onkeyup-attribute: <input id=""searchField"" onkeyup=""onki[â€™kokoâ€™].search({â€™queryExpansionâ€™ : true})"" /> The functionalities of the widget can be customized by parametrizing the method call. By default the selected query concepts and the concepts expanding them are stored in hidden input fields to be sent to the application along with the search form. A JavaScript callback method can be used, too. The form of the query expression can be defined by providing a JavaScript method. For example, in a Google query, disjunctive query terms term1 and term2 are expressed in the form â€œterm1â€ OR â€œterm2â€. For a demonstration we have used the Kantapuu.fi museum collection search form, and created a copy of it with three integrated ONKI widgets for the fields keywords, place of use, and material. Also a demonstration page consisting of a Google search field with integrated ONKI widget is available. Acknowledgements This work has been funded by Lusto The Finnish Forest Museum.

Long-Run Average Behavior of Vector Addition Systems with States,"A vector addition system with states (VASS) consists of a finite set of states and counters. A configuration is a state and a value for each counter; a transition changes the state and each counter is incremented, decremented, or left unchanged. While qualitative properties such as state and configuration reachability have been studied for VASS, we consider the long-run average cost of infinite computations of VASS. The cost of a configuration is for each state, a linear combination of the counter values. In the special case of uniform cost functions, the linear combination is the same for all states. The (regular) long-run emptiness problem is, given a VASS, a cost function, and a threshold value, if there is a (lasso-shaped) computation such that the long-run average value of the cost function does not exceed the threshold. For uniform cost functions, we show that the regular long-run emptiness problem is (a)~decidable in polynomial time for integer-valued VASS, and (b)~decidable but nonelementarily hard for natural-valued VASS (i.e., nonnegative counters). For general cost functions, we show that the problem is (c)~NP-complete for integer-valued VASS, and (d)~undecidable for natural-valued VASS. Our most interesting result is for (c) integer-valued VASS with general cost functions, where we establish a connection between the regular long-run emptiness problem and quadratic Diophantine inequalities. The general (nonregular) long-run emptiness problem is equally hard as the regular problem in all cases except (c), where it remains open.",2019,

Sound Field Reproduction via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers Based Lasso Plus Regularized Least-Square,"This paper proposes a 3-D sound field reproduction (SFR) approach through the combination of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and regularized least square (LS). The proposed SFR method is split into two parts through the pressure matching optimization of loudspeaker positions and the computation of driving signals. At the first part, a plurality of candidate positions of loudspeakers in planar array is given and, then, the active speaker selection method is proposed based on ADMM complex Lasso algorithm for selecting the optimal loudspeaker positions. Afterwards, regularized LS is adopted to calculate the selected loudspeaker weights and control the total power. The numerical simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed SFR scheme outperforms the existing sparse loudspeakersâ€™ placement and weight optimization algorithms especially in under-sampled sound fields. Meanwhile, the evaluations also confirmed that the proposed method could significantly reduce the computational complexity of the active loudspeaker selection compared to the state-of-the-art Lasso-based SFR. Effectively, the proposed method uses a relatively small number of loudspeakers for a satisfying reproduction quality.",2018,IEEE Access
Cost-effective survival prediction for patients with advanced prostate cancer using clinical trial and real-world hospital registry datasets,"INTRODUCTION
Predictive survival modeling offers systematic tools for clinical decision-making and individualized tailoring of treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes while reducing overall healthcare costs. In 2015, a number of machine learning and statistical models were benchmarked in the DREAM 9.5 Prostate Cancer Challenge, based on open clinical trial data for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, applying these models into clinical practice poses a practical challenge due to the inclusion of a large number of model variables, some of which are not routinely monitored or are expensive to measure.


OBJECTIVES
To develop cost-specified variable selection algorithms for constructing cost-effective prognostic models of overall survival that still preserve sufficient model performance for clinical decision making.


METHODS
Penalized Cox regression models were used for the survival prediction. For the variable selection, we implemented two algorithms: (i) LASSO regularization approach; and (ii) a greedy cost-specified variable selection algorithm. The models were compared in three cohorts of mCRPC patients from randomized clinical trials (RCT), as well as in a real-world cohort (RWC) of advanced prostate cancer patients treated at the Turku University Hospital. Hospital laboratory expenses were utilized as a reference for computing the costs of introducing new variables into the models.


RESULTS
Compared to measuring the full set of clinical variables, economic costs could be reduced by half without a significant loss of model performance. The greedy algorithm outperformed the LASSO-based variable selection with the lowest tested budgets. The overall top performance was higher with the LASSO algorithm.


CONCLUSION
The cost-specified variable selection offers significant budget optimization capability for the real-world survival prediction without compromising the predictive power of the model.",2020,International journal of medical informatics
Vertical Lasso and Horizontal Lasso Sutures for Repair of Horizontal Cleavage and Horizontal Oblique Meniscal Tears: Surgical Technique and Indications,"Horizontal cleavage and horizontal oblique meniscal tears have traditionally been treated with partial meniscectomy. Recent research has shown the deleterious long-term effects of meniscectomy in these patients regarding the development of osteoarthritis. Meniscal preservation is thus the preferred method of surgical treatment in patients with these tears. However, traditional repair techniques using inside-out sutures or suture anchor-based devices do not address the horizontally aligned nature of these particular tears and thus do not compress the meniscal tissue in the correct plane. The recent development of an arthroscopic suture-passing system now allows surgeons to place arthroscopic sutures in any pattern or direction. This allows surgeons to treat tears of any type with sutures ideally placed to repair the given tears. This Technical Note describes and demonstrates 2 all-suture, all-inside, arthroscopic meniscus repair techniques to treat these challenging horizontal tear types. The repair techniques are named the vertical lasso and horizontal lasso.",2017,Arthroscopy Techniques
Group Invariance and Computational Sufficiency,"Statistical sufficiency formalizes the notion of data reduction. In the decision theoretic interpretation, once a model is chosen all inferences should be based on a sufficient statistic. However, suppose we start with a set of procedures rather than a specific model. Is it possible to reduce the data and yet still be able to compute all of the procedures? In other words, what functions of the data contain all of the information sufficient for computing these procedures? This article presents some progress towards a theory of ""computational sufficiency"" and shows that strong reductions can be made for large classes of penalized $M$-estimators by exploiting hidden symmetries in the underlying optimization problems. These reductions can (1) reveal hidden connections between seemingly disparate methods, (2) enable efficient computation, (3) give a different perspective on understanding procedures in a model-free setting. As a main example, the theory provides a surprising answer to the following question: ""What do the Graphical Lasso, sparse PCA, single-linkage clustering, and L1 penalized Ising model selection all have in common?""",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
High Dimensional Inference in Partially Linear Models,"We propose two semiparametric versions of the debiased Lasso procedure for the model $Y_i = X_i\beta_0 + g_0(Z_i) + \epsilon_i$, where $\beta_0$ is high dimensional but sparse (exactly or approximately). Both versions are shown to have the same asymptotic normal distribution and do not require the minimal signal condition for statistical inference of any component in $\beta_0$. Our method also works when $Z_i$ is high dimensional provided that the function classes $E(X_{ij} |Z_i)$s and $E(Y_i|Z_i)$ belong to exhibit certain sparsity features, e.g., a sparse additive decomposition structure. We further develop a simultaneous hypothesis testing procedure based on multiplier bootstrap. Our testing method automatically takes into account of the dependence structure within the debiased estimates, and allows the number of tested components to be exponentially high.",2019,
Algae-induced occupational asthma in a thalassotherapist.,"BACKGROUND
Algae powders have been increasingly used in therapeutic preparations. Their potential as inducers of occupational asthma (OA), however, remains to be demonstrated.


METHODS
A 33-year-old woman developed asthma following exposure to algae powder used for thalassotherapy. She had positive patch tests to nickel and cobalt in an evaluation for intermittent skin rash. At work, she had a normal forced expiratory flow in 1 s (FEV(1)) but moderate airway hyperresponsiveness. Bronchial provocation tests (BPT) were obtained.


RESULTS
On BPT, an isolated early response was observed after a 1-min inhalation of dry algae powder, with a 50% fall in FEV(1) after exposure; the control BPT with lactose powder was negative.


CONCLUSIONS
We report a case of algae-powder-induced OA. Such responses could be due to a sensitization to algae proteins or metal contaminants bioabsorbed by the vegetal particles.",2006,Occupational medicine
Metal dynamics in an Antarctic food chain.,"The concentrations of copper, zinc, cadmium, selenium and mercury were determined in eggs, muscle, liver, kidney and stomach content of nestilings and adults of the Antarctic petrel, Thalassoica antarctica, and its predator, the south polar skua, Chataracta maccormicki, from Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica. The dominant food of the petrels is krill, Euphausia superba. The results show relatively high levels of cadmium in krill, which is assumed to be the main reason for the high levels of cadmium in petrels and skuas. Cadmium is almost absent in eggs, but accumulates very rapidly with age in nestlings. The copper concentrations in livers of nestling petrels reach very high levels during growth. This may be seen in connection with physiological development processes. Mercury seems to be accumulated with age and between trophic levels. Among the nestlings, the mercury levels decrease with increasing age, which may be accomplished by the excretion of mercury through the growth of feathers and as a dilution effect during growth. Selenium and mercury are inversely correlated in nestlings. The levels of zinc were similar for different nestling stages and between nestlings and adults in skuas and petrels.",2001,Marine pollution bulletin
"Mid-carboniferous Ammonoid Biostratigraphy, Southern Nye County, Nevada: Implications of the First North American Homoceras","Abstract The Scotty Wash Formation on the Nevada Test Site (NTS), southern Nye County, Nevada has produced the first North American representatives of the globally significant index ammonoids Homoceras s.s. and Isohomoceras s.s. and contains the only ammonoid succession across an uninterrupted mid-Carboniferous boundary sequence known in North America. Four ammonoid assemblages can be recognized at NTS that are homotaxial with the reference successions for the middle and upper Arnsbergian (E2) and Chokierian (H1) Stages, Namurian Series, in western Europe, and their equivalents worldwide. The upper Mississippian (Chesterian) portions of the NTS sections yield assemblages referable to a Eumorphoceras girtyi Ammonoid Biozone, representing the middle Arnsbergian Stage (E2b), followed by a Delepinoceras thalassoide Ammonoid Biozone, equivalent to the upper Arnsbergian Stage (E2c). The latter ammonoid biozone also occurs in the Imo and Rhoda Creek Formations of Arkansas and Oklahoma, requiring reassignment of those formations to the upper Arnsbergian Stage (E2c). The appearance of the Isohomoceras subglobosum Ammonoid Biozone marks the base of the Chokierian Stage (H1a) at NTS. The zonal name-bearer continues into lower Pennsylvanian (Morrowan) strata, where it joins the Homoceras coronatum coronatum Ammonoid Biozone assemblage in an interval equivalent to the upper Chokerian Series (H1b). A pronounced unconformity at NTS separates the Scotty Wash Formation from the overlying Tippipah Limestone, which contains a fifth ammonoid assemblage characterized by Cancelloceras cf. C. elegans that is equivalent to the Yeadonian Stage (G1), Namurian Series, of western Europe. The conodont succession recovered from the ammonoid-bearing sections at NTS allows refined correlation of the Arnsbergian and Chokierian Stages with the Mid-Carboniferous Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) at nearby Arrow Canyon, Nevada, and the North American midcontinent. The Lower Rhachistognathus muricatus Conodont Biozone of western North America is equivalent to the upper Arnsbergian Stage (E2c), and must include the upper portion of the Adetognathus unicornis Conodont Biozone as recognized in the midcontinent. The Upper R. muricatus Conodont Biozone is equivalent to that portion of the Chokierian Stage (H1a) below the appearance of Declinognathodus noduliferus, marking the mid-Carboniferous boundary horizon, including some of the R. primus Conodont Biozone as used in the North American midcontinent. The intercontinental mid-Carboniferous boundary, drawn at the appearance of D. noduliferus, does not correspond to the Arnsbergian-Chokierian Stage boundary (E2c-H1a) that is defined by the appearance of Isohomoceras subglobosum. A significant break occurs in the Arrow Canyon GSSP less than 4 m above the position of the mid-Carboniferous boundary, where Chokerian strata (H1) are probably succeeded by Kinderscoutian strata (R1). Higher at Arrow Canyon, the position of the Scotty Wash-Tippipah unconformity juxtaposes Kinderscoutian and Yeadonian (G1) strata and the entire upper Namurian Series is limited to no more than 54 m. Comparison of Eurasian and North American ammonoid assemblage compositions suggests that at least intermittent faunal interchange persisted between the two regions until at least the close of the Chokierian. Definition of the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary, which has never been defined faunally in either type area, to correspond to the intercontinental mid-Carboniferous boundary would be compatible with relationships known in the Chesterian and Morrowan type areas. Taxonomic treatment of the Chokierian ammonoid assemblage from Syncline Ridge, NTS provided herein includes Proshumardites karpinskii Rauser-Tschernoussova, 1928; Eosyngastrioceras inexpectans Titus, 2000; Somoholites cf. S. merriami (Miller and Furnish, 1940b); Euroceras ellipsoidale Ruzhencev and Bogoslovskaya, 1971a; Isohomoceras subglobosum (Bisat, 1924); Homoceras diadema (Beyrich, 1837); H. coronatum coronatum (Haug, 1898); and H. leedomi new species.",2001,

In this research, we developed a machine learning model to forecast the KOSPI index and analyze the accuracy of the prediction. We use three machine learning model : SVM(support vector machines), Lasso regression, and ANN(Artificial Neural Network). We divided our data into two parts : 'in sample' data and 'out of sample' data. The 'in sample' data is from January 1st, 2000 to December 31st, 2010. And the 'out of sample' data is from January 1st, 2011 to September 15th, 2015. The result of the experiment, the 'in sample' data, the SVM showed higher accuracy compare to the ANN. On the other hand, in the 'out of sample' data, ANN was superior than SVM. For the Lasso *êµì‹ ì €ìž ë³¸ ì—°êµ¬ëŠ” 2016ë…„ë„ ìƒëª…ëŒ€í•™êµ êµë‚´ì—°êµ¬ë¹„ë¥¼ ì§€ì›ë°›ì•„ ìˆ˜í–‰í•˜ì˜€ìŒ.",2016,

Adaptive Thresholding for Reconstructing Regulatory Networks from Time-Course Gene Expression Data,"Discovering regulatory interactions from time-course gene expression data constitutes a canonical problem in functional genomics and systems biology. The framework of graphical Granger causality allows one to estimate such causal relationships from these data. In this study, we propose an adaptively thresholding estimates of Granger causal effects obtained from the lasso penalization method. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed technique, and discuss the advantages it offers over competing methods, such as the truncating lasso. Its performance and that of its competitors is assessed on a number of simulated settings and it is applied on a data set that captures the activation of T-cells.",2012,Statistics in Biosciences
Distribution of Seagrasses and Common Seaweeds Around Nampula Province (Northern Mozambique) with Emphasis on MoÃ§ambique Island,"The diversity and distribution of seagrasses and common seaweeds in Nampula
province was studied. The field work took place between January and April 2002. 11 seagrasses and 53 common seaweed species were identified at Mocambique Island. From all studied sites, Fernao Veloso and Mocambique were the most diverse in seagrasses whereas Relanzapo and Ilha-dos-Sete-Paus in seaweeds. Seagrasses and seaweeds were mapped in Mocambique Island and grouped in nine community types namely: Thalassia hemprichii/ Halodule wrightii, Thalassia hemprichii/ macroalgae, Sargassum spp. / Cystoseira spp, Nanozostera capensis/Cymodocea rotundata/ Halodule wrightii, Cymodocea rotundata, Thalassodendron ciliatum/ Macroalgae, Thalassodendron ciliatum/Syringodium isoetifolium, Thalassodendron ciliatum , and Syringodium isoetifolium . All the above communities covered up to 70% of the total intertidal area, with Thalassia hemprichii /macroalgae being the largest community in Mocambique Island. Common species such as Thalassodendron ciliatum, Syringodium isoetifolium , and Sargassum spp. occur mainly in sublittoral fringe; while Thalassia hemprichii, Cystoseira myrica Laurencia papillosa at midlittoral and Enteromorpha and some Ulva sp. close to the shoreline. The present study contributes to fill up the lack of information regarding the community ecology of seagrass and seaweed in the Nampula province.

Deep model-based feature extraction for predicting protein subcellular localizations from bio-images,"Protein subcellular localization prediction is important for studying the function of proteins. Recently, as significant progress has been witnessed in the field of microscopic imaging, automatically determining the subcellular localization of proteins from bio-images is becoming a new research hotspot. One of the central themes in this field is to determine what features are suitable for describing the protein images. Existing feature extraction methods are usually hand-crafted designed, by which only one layer of features will be extracted, which may not be sufficient to represent the complex protein images. To this end, we propose a deep model based descriptor (DMD) to extract the high-level features from protein images. Specifically, in order to make the extracted features more generic, we firstly trained a convolution neural network (i.e., AlexNet) by using a natural image set with millions of labels, and then used the partial parameter transfer strategy to fine-tune the parameters from natural images to protein images. After that, we applied the Lasso model to select the most distinguishing features from the last fully connected layer of the CNN (Convolution Neural Network), and used these selected features for final classifications. Experimental results on a protein image dataset validate the efficacy of our method.",2017,Frontiers of Computer Science
Smooth Blockwise Iterative Thresholding: A Smooth Fixed Point Estimator Based on the Likelihoodâ€™s Block Gradient,"The proposed smooth blockwise iterative thresholding estimator (SBITE) is a model selection technique defined as a fixed point reached by iterating a likelihood gradient-based thresholding function. The smooth Jamesâ€“Stein thresholding function has two regularization parameters Î» and Î½, and a smoothness parameter s. It enjoys smoothness like ridge regression and selects variables like lasso. Focusing on Gaussian regression, we show that SBITE is uniquely defined, and that its Stein unbiased risk estimate is a smooth function of Î» and Î½, for better selection of the two regularization parameters. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the predictive and oracle properties of this smooth version of adaptive lasso. The motivation is a gravitational wave burst detection problem from several concomitant time series. A nonparametric wavelet-based estimator is developed to combine information from all captors by block-thresholding multiresolution coefficients. We study how the smoothness parameter s tem...",2011,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Predicting Age of Onset in TTR-FAP Patients with Genealogical Features,"This work describes a problem oriented approach to analyze and predict the Age of Onset of Patients diagnosed with Transthyretin Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP). We constructed, from a set of clinical and familial records, three sets of features which represent different characteristics of a patient, before becoming symptomatic. Using those features, we tested a set of machine learning regression methods, namely Decision Tree (Regression Tree), Elastic Net, Lasso, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Ridge Regression and Support Vector Machine Regressor (SVM). Later, we defined a baseline model that represents the current medical practice to serve as a guideline for us to measure the accuracy of our approach. Our results show a significant improvement of machine learning methods when compared with the current baseline.",2018,2018 IEEE 31st International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)
The Socioeconomic Impact of Lymphatic Filariasis in Tropical Countries.,"Abstract Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is an endemic parasitic disease and a major cause of acute and chronic morbidity and incapacitation with devastating public health and socio-economic consequences. It exacerbates poor conditions of afflicted persons and endemic communities through reduced or lost labour supply and productivity. Stigmatisation and discrimination are byproducts of LF that lead to reduced prospects of both marriage and a normal sexual life. LF causes absenteeism from school and poor academic performance. Socio-economic factors and the cost of treatment for LF are presented. Additionally, our discussion includes the description of a two-drug combination introduced in endemic communities to suppress circulating microfilariae and interrupt spread of the disease. An argument is also made for collective support of the current Global Programme for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem and obstacle to socioeconomic development. Introduction Filariasis is a group of human and animal infectious diseases caused by nematode parasites (round worms) of the order filariidae, commonly called filariae. Female worms transmit active embryos called microfilariae (MF) into their selected host. Upon entering into the skin MF migrate to the lymphatic system and develop into mature adults. In the lymphatic system, the adult worms provoke a variety of clinical manifestations which include periodic recurring episodes of localized inflammation, tenderness, and pain of the affected lymph and or vessel, often accompanied by fever and commonly referred to as acute adenolymphangitis (ADL). Other manifestations include lymphoedema and elephantiasis of the limbs, genitals, breast; hydrocoele; vulval/labial oedema; and chyluria. Genital complications are seen only in bancroftian filariasis. Hydrocoele and swelling of the testis are the most common symptoms, followed by elephantiasis of the legs, scrotum, arm, vulva, and breast in descending order of frequency (Pani, Balakrishnan, Srividya, Bundy, & Grenfell, 1991). The majority of infected persons once thought to be asymptomatic (without visible clinical manifestations) are now recognised as having serious internal hidden renal, genital, and lymphatic damage. A large number also suffer from a progressive lung disease called tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE), caused by an inflammatory reaction against MF in the lungs (Evans, Gelband, & Vlassoff, 1992; Kumaraswani, 2000; WHO, 1992, 1994). There are more than 50 filariae parasites known to infect mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Only eight of these are common parasites of man; they are Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, Brugia timori, Onchocerca volvulus, Loa loa, Mansonella perstans, Mansonell streptocerca, and Mansonella ozzardi. Of these, the adults of W. bancrofti, B. malayi, and B. timori reside in the nodes and vessels of the lymphatic system and can induce pathological complications. Hence they are collectively referred to as lymphatic filarial parasites, causing lymphatic filariasis (LF)-a disease of the tropics; i.e., an infection caused by a parasitic worm that lives in the lymph system (Directors of Health Promotion and Education, 2005). A large body of information about the socio-cultural and economic aspects of LF has emerged since the mid-1980s. This information has not been combined, principally because of the rapidity at which new information and policies are independently generated from studies conducted in different parts of the world. However, with the global alliance to eliminate LF as a public health problem and obstacle to socioeconomic development, it becomes imperative to integrate data from these studies for a better understanding of the dynamics of LF and its management. Our goal herein is to show how this disabling disease has exacerbated the poor conditions of afflicted persons and endemic communities. We begin by describing the burden of LF, followed by a discussion of how health programmes and medications have been introduced into endemic communities and used as potential means of eliminating LF Additionally, we examine the socioeconomic consequences of LF on labour and productivity. â€¦",2007,The Negro educational review
GAM selection via convex optimization,"While smoothing and additive models were the rage in the 80s and 90s, conxex optimization is one of the present-day tools of choice - the lasso and its relatives induce sparsity in models.

Statistical-Computational Tradeoffs in High-Dimensional Single Index Models,"We study the statistical-computational tradeoffs in a high dimensional single index model Y = f(X>Î²âˆ—) + , where f is unknown, X is a Gaussian vector and Î²âˆ— is s-sparse with unit norm. When Cov(Y,X>Î²âˆ—) 6= 0, [43] shows that the direction and support of Î²âˆ— can be recovered using a generalized version of Lasso. In this paper, we investigate the case when this critical assumption fails to hold, where the problem becomes considerably harder. Using the statistical query model to characterize the computational cost of an algorithm, we show that when Cov(Y,X>Î²âˆ—) = 0 and Cov(Y, (X>Î²âˆ—)2) > 0, no computationally tractable algorithms can achieve the information-theoretic limit of the minimax risk. This implies that one must pay an extra computational cost for the nonlinearity involved in the model.",2019,
Longitudinal predictors of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors in sexual and gender minority adolescents.,"Sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations are at increased risk for several negative psychological outcomes, including self-injury. Although correlates of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) have been identified, it is unclear which factors are prospective predictors of SITB engagement in SGM youth. The current study investigated an online sample of 252 SGM adolescents over a 6-month period. Participants reported attitudes based on SGM identity, depression, self-criticism, body image, family support and family strain, friend NSSI engagement, and experiences of everyday discrimination. Lasso and elastic net regularized logistic regressions were used to examine which baseline variables were associated with SITB engagement at follow-up. Models resulted in excellent predictive accuracy of nonsuicidal self-injury and suicidal ideation (mean Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics Curve [AUC] of 0.90 and 0.91), good predictive accuracy for suicide plans (mean AUC = 0.85), and fair predictive accuracy for suicidal behaviors (mean AUC = 0.78). Several variables emerged as prospectively related to SITB risk, with varied associations across different SITBs. Results suggest that minority-specific factors may predict SITBs in SGM adolescents.

Zoosporic true fungi in marine ecosystems: a review,"Although many species of zoosporic true fungi have been frequently observed and studied in freshwater and soil ecosystems, only three species have been properly identified and partially characterised from brackish and marine ecosystems, namely Rhizophydium littoreum Amon, Thalassochytrium gracilariopsis Nyvall, Pedersen et Longcore and Chytridium polysiphoniae Cohn. These species are either facultative or obligate parasites of marine macroalgae and invertebrates. Also, some species of Olpidium and Rhizophydium are parasites of small marine green algae and diatoms. Although the physiological effects of these pathogens on the growth and metabolism of their hosts are poorly understood, parasitism by C. polysiphoniae possibly affects the rates of photosynthesis and patterns of growth in infected communities of brown algae. Saprobic ecotypes of R. littoreum can also colonise dead-plant and animal substrates. Zoospores from zoosporic true fungi and other groups of microbes possibly provide important food resources for grazing and filter-feeding zooplankton and metazoans in marine ecosystems where the prevalence of disease is high or where accumulated detritus enhances biodiversity in food webs. However, quantitative studies have not yet been attempted. Recently, environmental sampling with molecular techniques has revealed unknown clades of zoosporic true fungi in extreme marine ecosystems. These fungi have been grossly under-sampled and under-studied in marine environments.",2011,Marine and Freshwater Research
Identification of a prognostic signature for old-age mortality by integrating genome-wide transcriptomic data with the conventional predictors: the Vitality 90+ Study,"BackgroundPrediction models for old-age mortality have generally relied upon conventional markers such as plasma-based factors and biophysiological characteristics. However, it is unknown whether the existing markers are able to provide the most relevant information in terms of old-age survival or whether predictions could be improved through the integration of whole-genome expression profiles.MethodsWe assessed the predictive abilities of survival models containing only conventional markers, only gene expression data or both types of data together in a Vitality 90+ study cohort consisting of nâ€‰=â€‰151 nonagenarians. The all-cause death rate was 32.5% (49 of 151 individuals), and the median follow-up time was 2.55Â years.ResultsThree different feature selection models, the penalized Lasso and Ridge regressions and the C-index boosting algorithm, were used to test the genomic data. The Ridge regression model incorporating both the conventional markers and transcripts outperformed the other models. The multivariate Cox regression model was used to adjust for the conventional mortality prediction markers, i.e., the body mass index, frailty index and cell-free DNA level, revealing that 331 transcripts were independently associated with survival. The final mortality-predicting transcriptomic signature derived from the Ridge regression model was mapped to a network that identified nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-ÎºB) as a central node.ConclusionsTogether with the loss of physiological reserves, the transcriptomic predictors centered around NF-ÎºB underscored the role of immunoinflammatory signaling, the control of the DNA damage response and cell cycle, and mitochondrial functions as the key determinants of old-age mortality.",2014,BMC Medical Genomics
Robust Inference on Average Treatment Effects with Possibly More Covariates than Observations,"This paper concerns robust inference on average treatment effects following model selection. Under selection on observables, we construct confidence intervals using a doubly-robust estimator that are robust to model selection errors and prove their uniform validity over a large class of models that allows for multivalued treatments with heterogeneous effects and selection amongst (possibly) more covariates than observations. The semiparametric efficiency bound is attained under appropriate conditions. Precise conditions are given for any model selector to yield these results, and we specifically propose the group lasso, which is apt for treatment effects, and derive new results for high-dimensional, sparse multinomial logistic regression. Both a simulation study and revisiting the National Supported Work demonstration show our estimator performs well in finite samples.",2015,Journal of Econometrics
TemporÃ¤re Ausschaltung des Ggl. stellatum im Bilde des Elektrodermatogramms und Elektroencephalogramms,"ZusammenfassungDas Elektrodermatogramm ist der feinste Gradmesser jeder VerÃ¤nderung des Vegetativums; es ist, wie andernorts bereits begrÃ¼ndet, die â€žHandschrift des vegetativen Systemsâ€œ und eignet sich deshalb besonders zur Objektivierung der durch temporÃ¤re Grenzstrangblockade erreichten VerÃ¤nderungen.Das Elektrodermatogramm ist ein dem Elektroencephalogramm gleichwertiges Untersuchungsverfahren, das gerade in der KlÃ¤rung vegetativer Fragestellungen dem Elektroencephalogramm Ã¼berlegen ist. Beide Verfahren ergÃ¤nzen sich aber dann sinnvoll, wenn ihre Anwendung nicht die Grenze dessen Ã¼berschreitet, was man von ihnen verlangen kann.Es konnte gezeigt werden, daÃŸ der â€žgezielte Stichâ€œ manchmal zu KollapszustÃ¤nden und TodesfÃ¤llen fÃ¼hrt. Die bisher gÃ¼ltige Ansicht einer Ausgleichsregulation der Blutbewegung zwischen Gehirn und Kopfhaut oder SchilddrÃ¼se wird dahingehend ergÃ¤nzt, daÃŸ auch das gleichseitige GefÃ¤ÃŸgebiet des Armes eine nicht unbedeutende Rolle an dieser Ausgleichsbewegung des Blutes spielt. Ein neues Verfahren der intravenÃ¶sen Sauerstoffinfusion ist die Methode der Ggl.-stellatum-Ausschaltung Ã¼berlegen, da ohne Gefahr im Endeffekt das erreicht wird, was der â€žgezielte Stichâ€œ bewirken sollte.SummaryThe eleclrodermatogram (EDG) is the most precise method of study for all changes in the neurovegtative system: it is, as it has already been affirmed by other AA. â€œthe writing of the vegetative systemâ€ and therefore it is especially suitable for the objectivism of the modifications obtained with the temporary block of the sympathetic chain.The EDG is a method with the same tests as with EEG and exceeds the latter as far as the illustration of neurovegetative problems is concerned. But both techniques complete each other when their application does not surpass the limit of what one can expect from each of them.It has been proved that also the most precise blocking may sometimes lead to collapse or death. The opinion existing until now of a compensatory regulation of the blood flow between brain and pericranial tissues or thyroid glands is completed insomuch as also the vascular system of the arm on the same side has a rafaer important part in this compensation. The new procedure of intravenous infusion of oxygen is better than the method of blocking the stellate ganglion because in this way it is possible to obtain without danger what may be obtained with a precise injection.RÃ©sumÃ©L'Ã©lectrodermatogramme est la mÃ©thode la plus prÃ©cise d'Ã©tude de toutes les modifications du systÃ¨me neurovÃ©gÃ©tatif; comme il a dÃ©jÃ  Ã©tÃ© affirmÃ© ailleurs, c'est Â«l'Ã©criture du systÃ¨me vÃ©gÃ©tatifÂ», et par contre il se prÃªte tout particuliÃ¨rement Ã  l'objectivitÃ© les modifications obtenues par le bloc temporaire de la chaÃ®ne sympathique.L'Ã©lectrodermatogramme est une mÃ©thode semblable Ã l'E.

Modality and Component Aware Feature Fusion for RGB-D Scene Classification,"While convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been excellent for object recognition, the greater spatial variability in scene images typically meant that the standard full-image CNN features are suboptimal for scene classification. In this paper, we investigate a framework allowing greater spatial flexibility, in which the Fisher vector (FV) encoded distribution of local CNN features, obtained from a multitude of region proposals per image, is considered instead. The CNN features are computed from an augmented pixel-wise representation comprising multiple modalities of RGB, HHA and surface normals, as extracted from RGB-D data. More significantly, we make two postulates: (1) component sparsity - that only a small variety of region proposals and their corresponding FV GMM components contribute to scene discriminability, and (2) modal non-sparsity - within these discriminative components, all modalities have important contribution. In our framework, these are implemented through regularization terms applying group lasso to GMM components and exclusive group lasso across modalities. By learning and combining regressors for both proposal-based FV features and global CNN features, we were able to achieve state-of-the-art scene classification performance on the SUNRGBD Dataset and NYU Depth Dataset V2.",2016,2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
Learning Joint Intensity-Depth Sparse Representations,"This paper presents a method for learning overcomplete dictionaries of atoms composed of two modalities that describe a 3D scene: 1) image intensity and 2) scene depth. We propose a novel joint basis pursuit (JBP) algorithm that finds related sparse features in two modalities using conic programming and we integrate it into a two-step dictionary learning algorithm. The JBP differs from related convex algorithms because it finds joint sparsity models with different atoms and different coefficient values for intensity and depth. This is crucial for recovering generative models where the same sparse underlying causes (3D features) give rise to different signals (intensity and depth). We give a bound for recovery error of sparse coefficients obtained by JBP, and show numerically that JBP is superior to the group lasso algorithm. When applied to the Middlebury depth-intensity database, our learning algorithm converges to a set of related features, such as pairs of depth and intensity edges or image textures and depth slants. Finally, we show that JBP outperforms state of the art methods on depth inpainting for time-of-flight and Microsoft Kinect 3D data.",2014,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing
Logistic regression paradigm for training a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network. Application to gene expression datasets for cancer research,"OBJECTIVE
The speed of the diagnosis process is vital in pursuing the trial of curing cancer. During the last decade, precision medicine evolved by detecting different types of cancer through microarrays (MA) of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) processed by machine learning (ML) algorithms. Personalized diagnosis, followed by personalized treatment, should imply personalized hyperparameters of the ML. The goal of this paper is to propose a novel adaptive ML method that embeds knowledge into the architecture of the algorithm and also filters the features in order to reduce their number, increase computational speed, and decrease computational cost and time.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
fLogSLFN is a novel two-fold theoretically effective ML that can be used in two-class decision problems that embeds the logistic regression in such a manner that the hidden nodes of a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) are problem dependent. A filtering module based on the significance of each attribute is embedded in order to avoid the 'curse of dimensionality' phenomenon. The proposed model has been tested on three publicly available high-dimensional cancer datasets that contain gene expressions provided by complementary DNA (cDNA) array, and DNA microarray. The proposed novel method filtered logistic SLFN (fLogSLFN) has been also compared and statistically benchmarked to four ML algorithms: extreme learning machine (ELM), radial basis function network (RBF), single-hidden layer feedforward neural network trained by the backpropagation algorithm (BPNN), logistic regression with the LASSO penalty, and the adaptive single-hidden layer feedforward network (aSLFN).


MAIN FINDINGS
The experimental results showed that the fLogSLFN is competitive to the other state-of-the-art models, obtaining accuracies between 64,70% and 98.66% depending on the dataset it had been applied on.


CONCLUSIONS
In contrast to other state-of-the-art ML algorithms, the fLogSLFN is capable to embed the knowledge extracted from the data into its architecture, making it problem dependent. The filtering module increases its computational speed, while decreasing computational cost and time. The statistical analysis revealed the fact that by filtering the features the performance is kept, making the algorithm more efficient.",2020,Journal of biomedical informatics
Random Subspace Method for high-dimensional regression with the R package regRSM,"Model selection and variable importance assessment in high-dimensional regression are among the most important tasks in contemporary applied statistics. In our procedure, implemented in the package regRSM, the Random Subspace Method (RSM) is used to construct a variable importance measure. The variables are ordered with respect to the measures computed in the first step using the RSM and then, from the hierarchical list of models given by the ordering, the final subset of variables is chosen using information criteria or validation set. Modifications of the original method such as the weighted Random Subspace Method and the version with initial screening of redundant variables are discussed. We developed parallel implementations which enable to reduce the computation time significantly. In this paper, we give a brief overview of the methodology, demonstrate the packageâ€™s functionality and present a comparative study of the proposed algorithm and the competitive methods like lasso or CAR scores. In the performance tests the computational times for parallel implementations are compared.",2016,Computational Statistics
Quality of care in family planning programmes: a rapid assessment in Burkina Faso,In 1991 the Ministry of Health and Social Action conducted a rapid comprehensive assessment of the family planning program in Burkina Faso specifically the functional capacity of its subsystems (e.g. logistics equipment record-keeping and service delivery as well as information education and communication [IEC] activities) and the quality of its services at 53 of its 90 clinics. The clinics included those in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso and a random sample from 10 provinces. The research team used interviewing and observation techniques. The simple clear data collection instruments and immediate data entry and analysis allowed the results to be placed in the hands of policymakers within a few weeks after completion of the fieldwork. The senior program staff were involved throughout the study. In fact the research team sought their involvement in reviewing data collection instruments and adjusted them accordingly. This first ever assessment of the program resulted in a considerable range and quality of data which were so good that the Ministry the USAID mission UNFPA and the World Bank have all used the studys results to carry on a variety of projects. For example the Ministry prepared a reference document which included standards to implement Burkina Fasos population and family planning policies. It also used the data to rectify operational problems such as reordering the flow of good. Program managers quickly took actions to correct any weaknesses. Even though the methodology used was intended as a diagnostic tool it can also be used to evaluate progress over time as well as for other primary health care programs.,1993,Health Policy and Planning
Leaf production rates of Thalassodendron ciliatum from rocky and sandy habitats,"Growth and structure of Thalassodendron ciliatum were compared in plants from rocky and sandy habitats in southern Mozambique. Growth rate dynamics differed significantly between rocky and sandy plants: rocky plants had aleaf growth rate of 25.5 g DW m - 2 per day compared to 9.5 g DW m - 2 per day for sand. These differences depended on the number of shoots per area (4561 shoots m - 2 in rocky areas versus 888 shoots m - 2 on sand). Length increase was 56.9 m m - 2 per day in rocky areas and 22.3 m m - 2 per day for sand. In rocky areas 195 new leaves m - 2 per day were born compared to 75 new leaves m - 2 per day on sand. Total annual leaf production was high: 9322 g DW m - 2 for rocky areas and 3468 g DW m - 2 for sand. Leaf growth rate per shoot was generally 100% higher in sandy habitats than in rocky areas. The youngest leaf grew 2.9 mm per day (or 1 mg DW per day) in rocky areas and 5.4 mm per day (or 2 mg DW per day) on sand, giving a leaf turnover time (leaf renewal) around 23 days in rocky areas and around 12 days on sand. All five leaves on a shoot of rocky plants changed 3.2 times a year, while the average seven leaves changed 4.4 times a year on sand. Leaf biomass was 257.5 g DW m - 2 in rocky habitats, statistically different from 123.7 g DW m - 2 on sand, while leaf area indices were not statistically different. T. ciliatum from rocky habitats had a slightly higher root/rhizome biomass, probably as an adaptation for better anchorage of T. ciliatum in rock pools and crevices. Total rhizome length was 9 m m - 2 for rocks and 6.9 m m - 2 for sand. Seaweed epiphytes in rocky areas corresponded to 47.9% of the seagrass biomass while only 4.7% on sand.",2002,Aquatic Botany
Clinical Significance of Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide Gene Expression in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is considered the most deadly and frequently occurring type of ovarian cancer and is associated with various molecular compositions and growth patterns. Evaluating the mRNA expression pattern of the organic anion transporters (OATPs) encoded by SLCO genes may allow for improved stratification of HGSOC patients for targeted invention. The expression of SLCO mRNA and genes coding for putative functionally related ABC-efflux pumps, enzymes, pregnane-X-receptor, ESR1 and ESR2 (coding for estrogen receptors ERÎ± and ERÃŸ) and HER-2 were assessed using RT-qPCR. The expression levels were assessed in a cohort of 135 HGSOC patients to elucidate the independent impact of the expression pattern on the overall survival (OS). For identification of putative regulatory networks, Graphical Gaussian Models were constructed from the expression data with a tuning parameter K varying between meaningful borders (Pils et al., 2012; Auer et al., 2015, 2017; Kurman and Shih Ie, 2016; Karam et al., 2017; Labidi-Galy et al., 2017; Salomon-Perzynski et al., 2017; Sukhbaatar et al., 2017). The final value used (K = 4) was determined by maximizing the proportion of explained variation of the corresponding LASSO Cox regression model for OS. The following two networks of directly correlated genes were identified: (i) SLCO2B1 with ABCC3 implicated in estrogen homeostasis; and (ii) two ABC-efflux pumps in the immune regulation (ABCB2/ABCB3) with ABCC3 and HER-2. Combining LASSO Cox regression and univariate Cox regression analyses, SLCO5A1 coding for OATP5A1, an estrogen metabolite transporter located in the cytoplasm and plasma membranes of ovarian cancer cells, was identified as significant and independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 0.68, CI 0.49-0.93; p = 0.031). Furthermore, results indicated the benefits of patients with high expression by adding 5.1% to the 12.8% of the proportion of explained variation (PEV) for clinicopathological parameters known for prognostic significance (FIGO stage, age and residual tumor after debulking). Additionally, overlap with previously described signatures that indicated a more favorable prognosis for ovarian cancer patients was shown for SLCO5A1, the network ABCB2/ABCB3/ABCC4/HER2 as well as ESR1. Furthermore, expression of SLCO2A1 and PGDH, which are important for PGE2 degradation, was associated with the non-miliary peritoneal tumor spreading. In conclusion, the present findings suggested that SLCOs and the related molecules identified as potential biomarkers in HGSOC may be useful for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",2018,Frontiers in Pharmacology
Efficacy of Bacillus sphaericus 2362 against larvae of Anopheles gambiae under laboratory and field conditions in West Africa.,"A flowable concentrate of Bacillus sphaericus (Neide) strain 2362 was applied against Anopheles gambiae Giles s.l. mosquito larve in small plot field trials in Bobo-Dioulasso area. Burkina-Faso. Third and fourth instar larvae were controlled for 10-15 days with a dosage of 10 g/m2, 3-10 days with 1 or 0.1 mg/m2, and 2 days with 0.01 g/m2. Complete elimination of larval populations required 1 x 10(2) to 2 x 10(3) viable spores/ml in the larval feeding zone. After treatment, the total numbers of viable spores decreased in the ponds, due to ingestion of spores by non-target as well as target organisms and/or loss of viability of some spores by sunlight. This formulation was less effective against An. gambiae than against Culex quinquefasciatus Say larvae, both in laboratory bioassays and under field conditions.",1987,Medical and veterinary entomology
Classification of pulmonary lesion based on multiparametric MRI: utility of radiomics and comparison of machine learning methods,"We develop and validate a radiomics model based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the classification of the pulmonary lesion and identify optimal machine learning methods. This retrospective analysis included 201 patients (143 malignancies, 58 benign lesions). Radiomics features were extracted from multiparametric MRI, including T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), T1-weighted imaging (TIWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. Three feature selection methods, including recursive feature elimination (RFE), t test, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and three classification methods, including linear discriminate analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) were used to distinguish benign and malignant pulmonary lesions. Performance was compared by AUC, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, and specificity. Analysis of performance differences in three randomly drawn cross-validation sets verified the stability of the results. For most single MR sequences or combinations of multiple MR sequences, RFE feature selection method with SVM classifier had the best performance, followed by RFE with RF. The radiomics model based on multiple sequences showed a higher diagnostic accuracy than single sequence for every machine learning method. Using RFE with SVM, the joint model of T1WI, T2WI, and ADC showed the highest performance with AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.88â€‰Â±â€‰0.02 (sensitivity 83%; accuracy 82%; precision 91%; specificity 79%) in test set. Quantitative radiomics features based on multiparametric MRI have good performance in differentiating lung malignancies and benign lesions. The machine learning method of RFE with SVM is superior to the combination of other feature selection and classifier methods. â€¢ Radiomics approach has the potential to distinguish between benign and malignant pulmonary lesions. â€¢ Radiomics model based on multiparametric MRI has better performance than single-sequence models. â€¢ The machine learning methods RFE with SVM perform best in the current cohort.",2020,European Radiology
STATISTICAL ESTIMATION AND TESTING VIA THE ORDERED l 1 NORM By MaÅ‚gorzata,"We introduce a novel method for sparse regression and variable selection, which is inspired by modern ideas in multiple testing. Imagine we have observations from the linear model y = XÎ²+ z, then we suggest estimating the regression coefficients by means of a new estimator called the ordered lasso, which is the solution to minimize b 1 2â€–y âˆ’Xbâ€– 2 `2 + Î»1|b|(1) + Î»2|b|(2) + . . .+ Î»p|b|(p); here, Î»1 â‰¥ Î»2 â‰¥ . . . â‰¥ Î»p and |b|(1) â‰¥ |b|(2) â‰¥ . . . â‰¥ |b|(p) is the order statistic of the magnitudes of b. In short, the regularizer is an ordered `1 norm which penalizes the regression coefficients according to their rank: the higher the rankâ€”the closer to the topâ€”the larger the penalty. This is similar to the famous Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (BHq) [9], which compares the value of a test statistic taken from a family to a critical threshold that depends on its rank in the family. The ordered lasso is a convex program and we demonstrate an efficient algorithm for computing the solution. We prove that for orthogonal designs with p variables, taking Î»i = F âˆ’1(1âˆ’ qi) (F is the cumulative distribution function of the errors), qi = iq/(2p), controls the false discovery rate (FDR) for variable selection. This holds under the assumption that the errors are i.i.d. symmetric and continuous random variables. When the design matrix is nonorthogonal there are inherent limitations on the FDR level and the power which can be obtained with model selection methods based on `1-like penalties. However, whenever the columns of the design matrix are not strongly correlated, we demonstrate empirically that it is possible to select the parameters Î»i as to obtain FDR control at a reasonable level as long as the number of nonzero coefficients is not too large. At the same time, the procedure exhibits increased power over the lasso, which treats all coefficients equally. The paper illustrates further estimation properties of the new selection rule through comprehensive simulation studies.",2013,
Prediction of Benign and Malignant Thymic Tumors based on Radiomics Features,"The purpose of this study is to find out the radiomics features associated with differentiating benign and malignant thymic tumors from the quantitative CT features extracted by computer, and to establish a prediction mode, which can predict the benign and malignant thymic tumors, and improve the diagnostic efficiency of CT in thymic tumors. Retrospectively analyze the CT image data of 100 patients with pathologically confirmed thymic tumors. All selected images were preprocessed with A.K. (Artificial Intelligence Kit) software to extract the features of the lesions, and then we can use the Lasso algorithm to screen out CT radiomics features with diagnostic value and significant correlation with benign and malignant tumors. Logistic regression was used to construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of benign and malignant thymic tumors. The receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve and area under curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the constructed CT image features for benign and malignant thymic tumors. The most useful features of CT radiomics features were selected by Lasso algorithm: Surface Area, Inverse Difference Moment_AllDirection_offset1_SD, Voxel ValueSum, skewness, High Grey RuelnEmphasis_Allrection_offset7_SD. The area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.752.The feature parameters screened on CT images have good diagnostic efficacy in differentiating benign from malignant thymoma.",2019,2019 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)
Balanced Bayesian LASSO for heavy tails,"Regression procedures are not only hindered by large p and small n, but can also suffer in cases when outliers are present or the data generating mechanisms are heavy tailed. Since the penalized estimates like the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) are equipped to deal with the large p small n by encouraging sparsity, we combine a LASSO type penalty with the absolute deviation loss function, instead of the standard least squares loss, to handle the presence of outliers and heavy tails. The model is cast in a Bayesian setting and a Gibbs sampler is derived to efficiently sample from the posterior distribution. We compare our method to existing methods in a simulation study as well as on a prostate cancer data set and a base deficit data set from trauma patients.",2016,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
Parsimonious additive logistic models,"Logistic regression is a standard tool in statistics for binary classification. The logistic model relates the logarithm of the odds-ratio to the predictors via a linear regression model. A generalization is the additive logistic model, which replaces each linear term by an unspecified smooth function, allowing for more flexibility while preserving interpretability. Another variant is penalized logistic regression, which shrinks coefficients to improve the accuracy of prediction. Ridge regression (L2-penalization) and lasso (L1-penalization) are the main penalization procedures. An attractive property of the later is that it performs parameter estimation and variable selection simultaneously. New theoretical results, efficient algorithms, and available software play a major role in the recent popularization of lasso. In this study, L1-penalization is adapted to additive logistic regression fitted by smoothing splines. Coefficients associated to predictors. Coefficients associated to predictors with little effect on the response may be shrunk (some of them to zero). This approach gives parsimonious models, removes irrelevant variables, and identifies non linear trends. The estimates are computed via the usual Newton-Raphson update, combined with the lars-lasso algorithm, to resolve the penalization problem, and the backfitting algorithm to fit additive models. Different criteria based on the effective degrees of freedom are proposed to choose the penalization parameters. Performance is illustrated with some examples.",2008,
Geomorphological development of the eastern margin of the Australian Craton,"The denudation chronologies of five uplands of contrasting geological structure located at the eastern margin of the Australian Craton are examined. They are the Isa Highlands, MacDonnell Ranges and Flinders Ranges (fold mountains, orogenic setting); the Arcoona Plateau (dissected plateau, platform setting); and the Gawler Ranges (massif of old silicic volcanics, cratonic setting). In each, surfaces of Mesozoic age, many of them exhumed and of pre-Cretaceous age, are preserved. Each also appears to have been uplifted recurrently. Each was either overwhelmed or bordered by the Early Cretaceous (Neocomian-Aptian) sea. 
 
 
 
Tectonism associated with the break-up of Gondwana probably allowed this important marine transgression. Thereafter, thalassostatic and erosional/depositional isostatic responses have maintained the uplands as uplands and the intervening basins as negative topographic and structural units; the pattern of topography has been constant for the last 60â€“100 Ma.",1992,Earth Surface Processes and Landforms
Algunos Adelantos En La Microbioestratigrafia Del Jurasico En La Argentina Y Comparacion Con Otras Regiones Del Hemisferio Austral,"Composition and stratigraphic significance of 15 jurassic microfloras from Argentina are reported. Four Lower jurassic and ten Middle jurassic assemblages are from the Neuquen Basin; one Upper Jurassic assemblage from Extraandean Patagonia (Chubut Province). In the Lower Jurassic microfloras Classopollis is prevailing, and in one of them Nevesisporites vallatus de Jersey & Paten is an important marker. The incoming of Callialasporites dampieri (Balme ) Dev., Callialasporites segmentatus (Balme ) Srivastava and Inaperturopollenites turbatus is in the beds with Phymatoceras copiapense (Moricke) (lower Upper Toarcian, Zone of Grammoceras thouarsense); the Upper Toarcian and Middle and Upper jurassic rnicrofloras are characterized by the presence of Callialasporites dampieri and various sub-units can be distinguished within the dampieri-bearing assemblages: a) an Aalenian one with 60-70 % Classopollis and the presence of Inaperturopollenites turbatus; Microcachryidites is lacking; b) a Bajocian one with Â± 40 % Classopollis and the presence of Inaperturopollenites indicus and Microcachryidites; e) a Lower Callovian one with less than 10 % Classopollis and prevailing of Podocarpidites, Microcachryidites, Callialasporites and Inaperturopollenites ; d) an Upper Jurassic one with prevailing Classopollis (67 and more %). The first typical specimens of Callialasporites trilobatus appear in this Upper jurassic assemblage which, on the other hand, is lacking Inaperturopolienites limbatus and Cicatricosisporites, forms which appear with great frequency near the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary. The age of most of the Lower and Middle Jurassic microfloras is well documented by ammonites associated. This fact permits dating of comparable microfloras from non-rnarine beds, studied by Paten (1967), Reiser & Williams (1969) and de Jersey (1971) from the Surat Basin and Moreton Basin in Queensland (Australia). Microfloral similarities indicate close gondwanic relations between Australia and South America.",2013,Ameghiniana
Fused Lasso Dimensionality Reduction of Highly Correlated NWP Features,"Two problems when using Numerical Weather Prediction features in Machine Learning are the high dimensionality inherent to the current high-resolution models, and the high correlation of the features, which can affect the performance of learning machines as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). In this work we propose to reduce the dimension of the problem using a supervised Fused Lasso model, which generates meta-features corresponding to the average of the groups with constant coefficients. The Fused Lasso problem is defined in terms of the feature correlation graph and tries to retain features with the stronger connections. As shown experimentally, training the models over the correlation graph-based reduced dataset allows to decrease the overall computational time while preserving almost the same error in the case of Support Vector Regressors and even improving the error of the MLPs, if the original dimension is high.",2018,
"Sediminibacillus halophilus gen. nov., sp. nov., a moderately halophilic, Gram-positive bacterium from a hypersaline lake.","A Gram-positive, moderately halophilic bacterium, designated strain EN8d(T), was isolated from sediment from Lake Erliannor in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. Cells were facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped and motile and did not display endospore formation. Isolate EN8dT grew in a complex medium supplemented with 0-20 % (w/v) marine salts (optimally at 5-7.5 %, w/v). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons showed that strain EN8dT was a member of the family Bacillaceae, belonging to a cluster with Thalassobacillus (96.3 % gene sequence similarity) and Halobacillus (95.0-96.0 %), albeit emerging as an independent lineage from members of these two genera. Strain EN8dT contained cell-wall peptidoglycan based on meso-diaminopimelic acid and possessed MK-7 as the major respiratory isoprenoid quinone. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0. The polar lipid pattern consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and an unidentified glycolipid. The DNA G+C content was 47.5 mol%. Strain EN8dT could be clearly differentiated from its phylogenetic neighbours on the basis of several phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic features. Therefore strain EN8dT is considered to represent a novel genus and species, for which the name Sediminibacillus halophilus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Sediminibacillus halophilus is EN8dT (=CCM 7364T =CECT 7148T =CGMCC 1.6199T =DSM 18088T).",2008,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Consistent Model Combination of Lasso via Regularization Path,"It is well-known that model combination can improve prediction performance of regression model. We investigate the model combination of Lasso with regularization path in this paper. We first define the prediction risk of Lasso estimator, and prove that Lasso regularization path contains at least one prediction consistent estimator. Then we establish the prediction consistency for convex combination of Lasso estimators, which gives the mathematical justification for model combination of Lasso on regularization path. With the inherent piecewise linearity of Lasso regularization path, we construct the initial candidate model set, then select the models for combination with Occamâ€™s Window method. Finally, we carry out the combination on the selected models using the Bayesian model averaging. Theoretical analysis and experimental results suggest the feasibility of the proposed method.",2016,
A generalization of regularized dual averaging and its dynamics,"Excessive computational cost for learning large data and streaming data can be alleviated by using stochastic algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent and its variants. Recent advances improve stochastic algorithms on convergence speed, adaptivity and structural awareness. However, distributional aspects of these new algorithms are poorly understood, especially for structured parameters. To develop statistical inference in this case, we propose a class of generalized regularized dual averaging (gRDA) algorithms with constant step size, which improves RDA (Xiao, 2010; Flammarion and Bach, 2017). Weak convergence of gRDA trajectories are studied, and as a consequence, for the first time in the literature, the asymptotic distributions for online l1 penalized problems become available. These general results apply to both convex and non-convex differentiable loss functions, and in particular, recover the existing regret bound for convex losses (Nemirovski et al., 2009). As important applications, statistical inferential theory on online sparse linear regression and online sparse principal component analysis are developed, and are supported by extensive numerical analysis. Interestingly, when gRDA is properly tuned, support recovery and central limiting distribution (with mean zero) hold simultaneously in the online setting, which is in contrast with the biased central limiting distribution of batch Lasso (Knight and Fu, 2000). Technical devices, including weak convergence of stochastic mirror descent, are developed as by-products with independent interest. Preliminary empirical analysis of modern image data shows that learning very sparse deep neural networks by gRDA does not necessarily sacrifice testing accuracy.",2019,ArXiv
Quantitative Trait Loci for Cold Tolerance in Chickpea,"Fall-sown chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) yields are often double those of spring-sown chickpea in regions with Mediterranean climates that have mild winters. However, winter kill can limit the productivity of fall-sown chickpea. Developing cold-tolerant chickpea would allow the expansion of the current geographic range where chickpea is grown and also improve productivity. The objective of this study was to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with cold tolerance in chickpea. An interspecific recombinant inbred line population of 129 lines derived from a cross between ICC 4958, a cold-sensitive desi type (C. arietinum), and PI 489777, a coldtolerant wild relative (C. reticulatum Ladiz), was used in this study. The population was phenotyped for cold tolerance in the field over four field seasons (September 2011â€“March 2015) and under controlled conditions two times. The population was genotyped using genotypingby-sequencing, and an interspecific genetic linkage map consisting of 747 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, spanning a distance of 393.7 cM, was developed. Three significant QTL were found on linkage groups (LGs) 1B, 3, and 8. The QTL on LGs 3 and 8 were consistently detected in six environments with logarithm of odds score ranges of 5.16 to 15.11 and 5.68 to 23.96, respectively. The QTL CT Ca-3.1 explained 7.15 to 34.6% of the phenotypic variance in all environments, whereas QTL CT Ca-8.1 explained 11.5 to 48.4%. The QTLassociated SNP markers may become useful for breeding with further fine mapping for increasing cold tolerance in domestic chickpea. D.

Fiscal Federalism and the Stability and Growth Pact: A Difficult Union,"Balassone and Franco note that while the budget rules that frame EMU apply to national States, several EMU member nations are already organised on a federal basis and others, pressed by political and economic needs, have started to enact reforms aimed at increasing the degree of decentralisation. They highlight several critical areas in the interaction of fiscal decentralisation and the Stability and Growth Pact. Balassone and Franco point to the reduced flexibility of the European approach compared with solutions adopted in federally structured countries and to the asymmetry between the responsibilities laid on national and local governments by European rules (compliance with the rules depends on the conduct of all levels of government, but de facto it is the central government that is answerable to the EU and that must pay the price for non-compliance). This calls for strict controls over local governments to prevent free-riding. The authors examine alternative solutions to deal with these problems, such as the mechanical extension of the Stability and Growth Pact, the introduction of a golden rule for decentralised governments, also in the form of a market for deficit permits, and the use of reserve funds. Finally, Balassone and Franco analyse how the issue has been addressed in Italy through the introduction of the Domestic Stability Pact and stress the need for further significant refinements of these domestic rules.",2001,
Data mining approach to construction productivity prediction for cutter suction dredgers,"Abstract Cutter suction dredgers are important equipment in the dredging engineering. However, dredging construction productivity is affected by many factors such as soil, hydrology, meteorology and underwater sundries, making it difficult to obtain accurate prediction results. This paper presents a new integrated approach for using intelligent data mining algorithms to analyze dredger monitoring data and estimate the effective productivity. Through these combination algorithms, alongside Lasso and Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), the key features affecting the productivity are filtered out from a 255-dimensional monitoring data set. The continuous mean data cleaning method is proposed according to the characteristics of the filtered data, followed by a clean-up of the feature data to increase smoothness. Four machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, K-Nearest, Naive Bayes and eXtreme Gradient Enhancement (XGBoost), are used to estimate and analyze the productivity of a cutter suction dredger and applied to actual engineering cases. The results show that the prediction accuracy of XGBoost exceeds 90%, which is better than other algorithms used. Finally, the model is compared with the predictive model trained by the characteristics that influence productivity derived from the traditional method. The results still show that the XGBoost model with features obtained from machine learning as input terms has a better prediction effect.",2019,Automation in Construction
