LASSO Variable Selection Techniques in Data Envelopment Analysis,"The number of inputs and outputs factors has significant impacts on the production function estimation by data envelopment analysis (DEA). That is, â€œcurse of dimensionalityâ€ is an issue when using a small number of observations for high-dimensional frontier estimation. The study conducts a data generating process (DGP) to argue the typical â€œrule of thumbsâ€, e.g. the number of observations should be at least larger than twice of the number of inputs and outputs, used in DEA is ambiguous and may lead to large deviations in technical efficiency. The paper proposes a LASSO variable selection technique usually used in data mining for extracting significant factors in the formulation of sign-constrained convex nonparametric least squares (CNLS) as DEA, and the results show that the proposed LASSO-CNLS method is useful for providing guidelines of dimension reduction in DEA.",2016,
Halophilic and Halotolerant Micro-Organisms from Soils,"Hypersaline environments are extreme habitats in which several other factors, in addition to high salt content, may limit the growth of organisms. These additional factors include temperature, pH, pressure, oxygen, nutrient availability, and solar radiations (Rodriguez-Valera 1988). Hypersaline environments comprise hypersaline waters and soils . Hypersaline waters are defined as those environments that have higher concentrations of salts than seawater (Rodriguez-Valera 1988). However, depending on their origin, the salt composition may differ from that of seawater and on that basis hypersaline water habitats are categorized as thalassohaline , when the relative amounts of the different inorganic salts are approximately equal to those present in seawater, or as athalassohaline , if the proportions of the different salts are markedly different from those of seawater. The later environments are more heterogeneous and may have very different origins. Examples of thalassohaline water habitats, which are typically chroride types, are the Great Salt Lake or the solar salterns used for the industrial production of marine salt by evaporation of seawater; among the athalassohaline waters are the Dead Sea, the Wadi Natrun, Lake Magadi, and several other soda lakes. In contrast to the hypersaline waters, the hypersaline soils are not well defined and in fact there is no clear definition of a saline or hypersaline soil. They are widely represented in our planet. Because most soils contain small amounts of soluble salts, a soil would be considered as hypersaline when its salt concentration is above a certain threshold (Rodriguez-Valera 1988). According to Kaurichev (1980), soils containing more than 0.2% (w/v) soluble salt should be considered as saline soils. Micro-organisms show quite different responses to salt . According to the particular salt concentration required for their optimal growth, several physiological groups of micro-organisms are considered : (i) nonhalophiles require less than 1%",2008,

Editorial,"Over the last three decades, there has been increasing interest in exploiting sparseness constraints in signal processing, that is, searching for target signals with as few non-zero entries as possible. This approach was, perhaps, first exploited in the modelling of excitation signals in speech processing or reflectivity sequences in seismic deconvolution with only a small number of non-zero values. Some 30 years later, the associated mathematical methods and application domains, both for singleand multiple-dimensional signals, have evolved to a point where sparse signal processing has become an area of study in its own right. This special issue on sparse signal processing, therefore, begins with a review article by Marvasti et al. [1], entitled A unified approach to sparse signal processing which provides a tutorial review of sparse signal recovery using various techniques with minimal sampling measurements, in effect, compressed sampling, and also describes applications of sparsity in a number of other challenging domains. Many of the articles in this special issue are related to applications of sparse signal processing. The next set of articles provides examples of where sparsity can be exploited in parameter estimation problems. The article by Djafari [2] uses a Bayesian inference approach to address both signal and image inversion problems wherein sparsity is considered either in the original or transformed signal space. Taxonomy of prior models is provided for the related probabilistic frameworks, and associated estimation algorithms are developed. Angelosante and Giannakis [3], in an invited article, consider the problem of estimating the parameters of timevarying autoregressive models. They overcome the lack of continuity and high computational complexity in working with high-dimensional datasets by casting their problem as a sparse regression with grouped variables. This is then solved with a group least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator, denoted Lasso. Numerical evaluations are employed to demonstrate the merits of the approach. Zhu et al [4]. also examine a parameter estimation problem in the context of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). They address a difficult nonlinear problem by employing linearization and an over-complete dictionary. This is motivated by the sparse distribution in the observation space of SAR micromotion targets. A variational approximation framework is also exploited for Bayesian computation, and numerical simulations confirm the higher resolution achievable by the proposed approach over conventional methods. Xie et al. [5] provide a hybrid approach for 2D directionof-arrival estimation in the presence of mutual coupling across the array. They employ a manifold decomposition approach for the case when the number of sensors is sparse, smaller than required in traditional beamspacebased algorithms. In particular, an algorithm to estimate azimuth angle without exact knowledge of the mutual coupling is provided. Blanco and NÃ¡jar [6] propose an algorithm for estimating the angles of arrival of multiple uncorrelated sources impinging upon a uniform linear array. They use an overcomplete dictionary representation of the spatial covariance matrix model. A sparsity penalty is applied and a least angle regression/homotopic approach is used to solve the resulting objective function. Their approach is shown to achieve high resolution with the advantage of low computational cost. Li et al. [7] focus upon source localization with a single snapshot and improve the efficiency of an iterative adaptive approach by utilizing the optimal filter only on the spatial components corresponding to the impinging angles of the sources. Their evaluations confirm that this simplification attains comparable accuracy of source angle and power estimation with a substantial reduction in computational load. Sahnoun et al. [8] address multi-dimensional modal estimation using sparse estimation techniques in combination with an efficient multigrid approach. To overcome huge size in the necessary dictionaries, they refine their dictionaries over several levels of resolution.

Developing a claimsâ€™-based algorithm to identify US patients with COPD,"Background: Claims databases are useful sources to design algorithms for care management strategies. However, for conditions like COPD that depend on clinical data (e.g., spirometry) for accurate diagnosis, their non-availability in claims implies that any claimsâ€™ based identification algorithm that is developed will need to be validated in order to minimize potential misclassification. Aim and Objective: To develop and validate a predictive model to identify COPD patients using claims data integrated with medical records. Methods: A predictive model was developed using US administrative claims from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database linked to spirometry results data of 2,005 patients with a claims-based diagnosis of COPD between 01/01/12â€“11/30/13. LASSO regression with 10-fold cross-validation was used to model 1,505 COPD cases (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC Results: The final model included 14 predictors, the strongest of which included: presence of â‰¥3 COPD diagnostic codes each 30 days apart, â‰¥1 pulmonary rehabilitation claim, COPD hospitalization count, and â‰¥1 claim for smoking. The model had good discrimination in identifying COPD cases (c-statistic 0.73) and a high cross-validated positive predictive value (0.86, 95%CI=0.84-0.88) for a probability threshold of â‰¥75% to identify COPD cases. Conclusions: Using multiple diagnostic codes in combination with COPD related healthcare utilization data were found to be valid parameters for identifying COPD patients using claims data alone.",2019,European Respiratory Journal
The LASSO and Sparse Least Squares Regression Methods for SNP Selection in Predicting Quantitative Traits,"Recent work concerning quantitative traits of interest has focused on selecting a small subset of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from among the SNPs responsible for the phenotypic variation of the trait. When considered as covariates, the large number of variables (SNPs) and their association with those in close proximity pose challenges for variable selection. The features of sparsity and shrinkage of regression coefficients of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method appear attractive for SNP selection. Sparse partial least squares (SPLS) is also appealing as it combines the features of sparsity in subset selection and dimension reduction to handle correlations among SNPs. In this paper, we investigate application of the LASSO and SPLS methods for selecting SNPs that predict quantitative traits. We evaluate the performance of both methods with different criteria and under different scenarios using simulation studies. Results indicate that these methods can be effective in selecting SNPs that predict quantitative traits but are limited by some conditions. Both methods perform similarly overall but each exhibit advantages over the other in given situations. Both methods are applied to Canadian Holstein cattle data to compare their performance.",2012,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
Roads and passages in the Mediaeval western Macedonia,"Anna Comnena in the Alexiad describes the descent of her father Alexius Comnenus upon his adversary, the Norman sovereign Bohemund. The emperor advanced from Constantinople on Thessaloniki and from there to Trikala and Larissa, where a conflict took place between the two adversaries. Bohemund was besieged in Larissa in the spring of 1083. The identification of the placeâ€™s names (Ezeva or Ezevan, Andronia, Plavitza, kipoureia of Delphinas) which delivers Anna Comnena in describing the itinerary of Alexios Komnenos from Thessaloniki to Larissa allows us to determine the route taken by the emperor in his descent upon Bohemund as follows: Constantinople, Thessaloniki, Gonnoi, Meluna-pass, Elassona, Grevena (district of the villages Demeter-Karpero) and then, through the villages Spring-Kastraki to Meteora, Trikala-Larissa. This itinerary of Alexios Komnenos, as described, confirms the unÂ­interrupted use of the road from Elassona to Grevena (region Demeter-Karpero) and highlights the importance of the region of Grevena as junction on roads leading from Thessaloniki to Thessaly and southern Greece.",2013,
Sparse Regression,"Yuan an Lin (2004) proposed the grouped LASSO, which achieves shrinkage and selection simultaneously, as LASSO does, but works on blocks of covariates. That is, the grouped LASSO provides a model where some blocks of regression coefficients are exactly zero. The grouped LASSO is useful when there are meaningful blocks of covariates such as polynomial regression and dummy variables from categorical variables. In this paper, we propose an extension of the grouped LASSO, called â€˜Blockwise Sparse Regressionâ€™ (BSR). The BSR achieves shrinkage and selection simultaneously on blocks of covariates similarly to the grouped LASSO, but it works for general loss functions including generalized linear models. An efficient computational algorithm is developed and a blockwise standardization method is proposed. Simulation results show that the BSR compromises the ridge and LASSO for logistic regression. The proposed method is illustrated with two datasets.",2006,

Genetic Determinants of Weight Loss After Bariatric Surgery,"BackgroundThe weight loss after bariatric surgery shows considerable individual variation. Twin studies of response to dietary interventions and studies of bariatric surgery patients suggest that genetic differences may play a role. This study aimed to examine the effect of three genetic risk scores on the inter-individual variation in excess body mass index loss (EBMIL) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Furthermore, we searched among known adiposity-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for genetic determinants of the inter-individual variation in EBMIL.MethodsPatients with morbid obesity underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and were genotyped (nâ€‰=â€‰577). Two genetic risk scores for weight loss after bariatric surgery and a genetic risk score for body mass index were calculated. Associations between the genetic risk scores and EBMIL were evaluated. Lasso regression was performed on 126 SNPs known to be associated with adiposity.ResultsThe average EBMIL was 76.9% (range 21.7â€“149.2%). EBMIL was 81.1% (SD 20.6) and 73.9% (SD 21.7) in the high and low tertile groups of a genetic risk score for weight loss. Patients with a low genetic risk score for body mass index (in the lowest 5% percentile) had an EBMIL of 68.8% (SD 20.6, pâ€‰=â€‰0.018). Thirteen adiposity-related SNPs were identified to associate with EBMIL through lasso regression.DiscussionA genetic risk score was associated with EBMIL after bariatric surgery, but may not yet be applicable to clinical practice. Patients genetically predisposed to low body mass index had lower weight loss after bariatric surgery.",2019,Obesity Surgery
Jaccard Analysis and LASSO-Based Feature Selection for Location Fingerprinting with Limited Computational Complexity,"We propose an approach to reduce both computational complexity and data storage requirements for the online positioning stage of a fingerprinting-based indoor positioning system (FIPS) by introducing segmentation of the region of interest (RoI) into sub-regions, sub-region selection using a modified Jaccard index, and feature selection based on randomized least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We implement these steps into a Bayesian framework of position estimation using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) principle. An additional benefit of these steps is that the time for estimating the position, and the required data storage are virtually independent of the size of the RoI and of the total number of available features within the RoI. Thus the proposed steps facilitate application of FIPS to large areas. Results of an experimental analysis using real data collected in an office building using a Nexus 6P smart phone as user device and a total station for providing position ground truth corroborate the expected performance of the proposed approach. The positioning accuracy obtained by only processing 10 automatically identified features instead of all available ones and limiting position estimation to 10 automatically identified sub-regions instead of the entire RoI is equivalent to processing all available data. In the chosen example, 50% of the errors are less than 1.8 m and 90% are less than 5 m. However, the computation time using the automatically identified subset of data is only about 1% of that required for processing the entire data set.",2018,

[Study on polymorphisms of genes with susceptibility to drug induced liver injury in a cohort receiving anti-tuberculosis treatment].,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the association between the polymorphisms of genes involving in drug metabolism and transport as well as immunological reaction and the risk of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury(ATLI)in Chinese.


METHODS
This 1âˆ¶4 matched case-control study was conducted by using the data from a cohort study of Anti-tuberculosis Drugs Induced Adverse Reactions in National Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Progtam of China. Genes involving in three phase of drug metabolism and transport as well as related immunological reaction were chosen and single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs)were genotyped by TaqMan allele discrimination technology. Lasso regression and multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis were used to select susceptible genes.


RESULTS
A total of 33 genes with 75 SNPs were tested. The combined results of Lasso and regression logistic regression analysis showed that genetic polymorphism of SLCO1B1 rs4149014, HSPA1L rs2227956, STAT3 rs1053023 and IL-6 rs2066992 were significantly associated with the risk of ATLI(P<0.05).

Sparse Patch-Based Label Propagation for Accurate Prostate Localization in CT Images,"In this paper, we propose a new prostate computed tomography (CT) segmentation method for image guided radiation therapy. The main contributions of our method lie in the following aspects. 1) Instead of using voxel intensity information alone, patch-based representation in the discriminative feature space with logistic sparse LASSO is used as anatomical signature to deal with low contrast problem in prostate CT images. 2) Based on the proposed patch-based signature, a new multi-atlases label fusion method formulated under sparse representation framework is designed to segment prostate in the new treatment images, with guidance from the previous segmented images of the same patient. This method estimates the prostate likelihood of each voxel in the new treatment image from its nearby candidate voxels in the previous segmented images, based on the nonlocal mean principle and sparsity constraint. 3) A hierarchical labeling strategy is further designed to perform label fusion, where voxels with high confidence are first labeled for providing useful context information in the same image for aiding the labeling of the remaining voxels. 4) An online update mechanism is finally adopted to progressively collect more patient-specific information from newly segmented treatment images of the same patient, for adaptive and more accurate segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on a prostate CT image database consisting of 24 patients where each patient has more than 10 treatment images, and further compared with several state-of-the-art prostate CT segmentation algorithms using various evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves higher segmentation accuracy than any other methods under comparison.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
Improved Incremental First-Order Oracle Complexity of Variance Reduced Methods for Nonsmooth Convex Stochastic Composition Optimization,"We consider the nonsmooth convex composition optimization problem where the objective is a composition of two finite-sum functions and analyze stochastic compositional variance reduced gradient (\textsf{SCVRG}) methods for them. \textsf{SCVRG} and its variants have recently drawn much attention given their edge over stochastic compositional gradient descent (\textsf{SCGD}); but the theoretical analysis exclusively assumes strong convexity of the objective, which excludes several important examples such as Lasso, logistic regression, principle component analysis and deep neural nets. In contrast, we prove non-asymptotic incremental first-order oracle (\textsf{IFO}) complexity of \textsf{SCVRG} or its novel variants for nonsmooth convex composition optimization and show that they are provably faster than \textsf{SCGD} and gradient descent. More specifically, our method achieves the total \textsf{IFO} complexity of $O\left((m+n)\log\left(1/\epsilon\right)+1/\epsilon^3\right)$ which improves that of $O\left(1/\epsilon^{3.5}\right)$ and $O\left((m+n)/\sqrt{\epsilon}\right)$ obtained by \textsf{SCGD} and accelerated gradient descent respectively.

Stacked Penalized Logistic Regression for Selecting Views in Multi-View Learning,"In biomedical research many different types of patient data can be collected, including various types of omics data and medical imaging modalities. Applying multi-view learning to these different sources of information can increase the accuracy of medical classification models compared with single-view procedures. However, the collection of biomedical data can be expensive and taxing on patients, so that superfluous data collection should be avoided. It is therefore necessary to develop multi-view learning methods which can accurately identify the views most important for prediction. In recent years, several biomedical studies have used an approach known as multi-view stacking (MVS), where a model is trained on each view separately and the resulting predictions are combined through stacking. In these studies, MVS has been shown to increase classification accuracy. However, the MVS framework can also be used for selecting a subset of important views. To study the view selection potential of MVS, we develop a special case called stacked penalized logistic regression (StaPLR). Compared with existing view-selection methods, StaPLR can make use of faster optimization algorithms and is easily parallelized. We show that nonnegativity constraints on the parameters of the function which combines the views are important for preventing unimportant views from entering the model. We investigate the performance of StaPLR through simulations, and consider two real data examples. We compare the performance of StaPLR with an existing view selection method called the group lasso and observe that, in terms of view selection, StaPLR has a consistently lower false positive rate.",2018,ArXiv
General Proximal Gradient Method: A Case for Non-Euclidean Norms,"In this paper, we consider composite convex minimization problems. We advocate the merit of considering Generalized Proximal gradient Methods (GPM) where the norm employed is not Euclidean. To that end, we show the tractability of the general proximity operator for a broad class of structure priors by proposing a polynomial-time approach to approximately compute it. We also identify a special case of regularizers whose proximity operator admits an efficient greedy algorithm. We then introduce a proximity/projection-free accelerated variant of GPM. We illustrate numerically the benefit of non-Euclidean norms, on the estimation quality of the Lasso problem and on the time-complexity of the latent group Lasso problem.",2017,
Sparsity-Exploiting Robust Multidimensional Scaling,"Multidimensional scaling (MDS) seeks an embedding of N objects in a p <; N dimensional space such that inter-vector distances approximate pairwise object dissimilarities. Despite their popularity, MDS algorithms are sensitive to outliers, yielding grossly erroneous embeddings even if few outliers contaminate the available dissimilarities. This work introduces robust MDS approaches exploiting the degree of sparsity in the outliers present. Links with compressive sampling lead to robust MDS solvers capable of coping with unstructured and structured outliers. The novel algorithms rely on a majorization-minimization approach to minimize a regularized stress function, whereby iterative MDS solvers involving Lasso and sparse group-Lasso operators are obtained. The resulting schemes identify outliers and obtain the desired embedding at computational cost comparable to that of their nonrobust MDS alternatives. The robust structured MDS algorithm considers outliers introduced by a sparse set of objects. In this case, two types of sparsity are exploited: i) sparsity of outliers in the dissimilarities; and ii) sparsity of the objects introducing outliers. Numerical tests on synthetic and real datasets illustrate the merits of the proposed algorithms.",2012,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
MRI-Based Radiomics: Associations With the Recurrence-Free Survival of Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated With Conventional Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization.,"BACKGROUND
Preoperative estimation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (c-TACE) is crucial for subsequent follow-up and therapy decisions.


PURPOSE
To evaluate the associations of radiomics models based on pretreatment contrast-enhanced MRI, a clinical-radiological model and a combined model with the recurrence-free survival (RFS) of patients with HCC after c-TACE, and to develop a radiomics nomogram for individual RFS estimations and risk stratification.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective.


POPULATION
In all, 184 consecutive HCC patients.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
1.5T or 3.0T, including T2 WI, T1 WI, and contrast-enhanced T1 WI.


ASSESSMENT
All HCC patients were randomly divided into the training (n = 110) and validation datasets (n = 74). Radiomics signatures capturing intratumoral and peritumoral expansion (1, 3, and 5â€‰mm) were constructed, and the radiomics models were set up using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression. Clinical-radiological features were identified by univariate and multivariate Cox regression. The clinical-radiological model and the combined model fusing the radiomics signature with the clinical-radiological risk factors were developed by a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. A radiomics nomogram derived from the combined model was established.


STATISTICAL TESTS
LASSO Cox regression, univariate and multivariate Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed. The discrimination performance of each model was quantified by the C-index.


RESULTS
Among the different peritumoral expansion models, only the 3-mm peritumoral expansion model (C-index, 0.714) showed a comparable performance (P = 0.4087) to that of the portal venous phase intratumoral model (C-index, 0.727). The combined model showed the best performance and the C-index was 0.802. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the cutoff values of the combined model relative to a median value (1.7426) perfectly stratified these patients into high-risk and low-risk subgroups.


DATA CONCLUSION
The combined model is more valuable than the clinical-radiological model or radiomics model alone for evaluating the RFS of HCC patients after c-TACE, and the radiomics nomogram can be used to preoperatively and individually estimate RFS.

Bayesian Quantile Regression Modeling to Estimate Extreme Rainfall in Indramayu,Quantile regression can be used to analyze symmetric or asymmetric data. Estimates of quantile regression parameters are obtained by the simplex method. Another approach is the Bayesian method based on Laplace's asymmetric distribution using MCMC. MCMC is used numerically to estimate parameters from each posterior distribution. The Bayesian quantile regression and the quantile regression can be used for statistical downscaling in extreme rainfall cases. This study used statistical downscaling to obtain relationship between global-scale data and local-scale data. The data used were monthly rainfall data in Indramayu and GCM output data. LASSO regularization was used to overcome multicollinearity problems in GCM output data. The purpose of this study was to compare Bayesian quantile regression models with quantile regression. The Bayesian quantile regression and the quantile regression couldpredict extreme rainfallmore accurate and consistent in one year ahead. The Bayesian quantile regression model is relatively better than the quantile regression.,2020,
Is Maliâ€™s Africanism a Dry Well?,"Starting from Maliâ€™s specific place in French Africanist research, this article attempts to gauge whether the dynamic perspective launched by Balandier will run out of steam or what its current and future continuations might be. The inevitable Dogon case shows that while two works have marked the past few years by their innovative analysis, little research on the Dogon has followed the path opened up by Balandier. This paper then looks at the works of three major followers of Balandier, Meillassoux, Bazin and Amselle. The formerÂ two focused their research on the study of the political-economic aspects of so-called traditional societies, leaving aside an entire section of the dynamist perspective that advocated the study of new fields of political and economic experience. However, the latter, Jean-Loup Amselle, also used history to produce a series of papers on the most contemporary aspects of Malian society. Nevertheless, despite Amselle and the specific works of several other anthropologists, research into the socio-political dynamics of Mali has long been characterised by a certain aimlessness, even through since 2000 a number of collective programmes seem to be inaugurating new anthropological perspectives. Recalling a paper by Alain Ricard which pleaded for writing about the discourse and analysis of cultural performances, in addition to a remark by Georges Balandier about the existing discrepancies between the â€œofficialâ€Â aspects of society and social practice, the article concludes by calling for an anthropology of those very discrepancies that can only be carried out through the very discrepancy of the anthropologistsâ€™ stance, and should focus on the new social and cultural practices that abound in Mali.",2010,Cahiers d'Ã‰tudes africaines
Algorithms for Sparse Linear Classifiers in the Massive Data Setting,"Classifiers favoring sparse solutions, such as support vector machines, relevance vector machines, LASSO-regression based classifiers, etc., provide competitive methods for classification problems in high dimensions. However, current algorithms for training sparse classifiers typically scale quite unfavorably with respect to the number of training examples. This paper proposes online and multi-pass algorithms for training sparse linear classifiers for high dimensional data. These algorithms have computational complexity and memory requirements that make learning on massive data sets feasible. The central idea that makes this possible is a straightforward quadratic approximation to the likelihood function.",2008,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Sparse and efficient estimation for partial spline models with increasing dimension,"We consider model selection and estimation for partial spline models and propose a new regularization method in the context of smoothing splines. The regularization method has a simple yet elegant form, consisting of roughness penalty on the nonparametric component and shrinkage penalty on the parametric components, which can achieve function smoothing and sparse estimation simultaneously. We establish the convergence rate and oracle properties of the estimator under weak regularity conditions. Remarkably, the estimated parametric components are sparse and efficient, and the nonparametric component can be estimated with the optimal rate. The procedure also has attractive computational properties. Using the representer theory of smoothing splines, we reformulate the objective function as a LASSO-type problem, enabling us to use the LARS algorithm to compute the solution path. We then extend the procedure to situations when the number of predictors increases with the sample size and investigate its asymptotic properties in that context. Finite-sample performance is illustrated by simulations.",2015,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
A generalized discriminant for sexing fulmarine petrels from external measurements,"ABsTRAcr.-Discriminant analysis can use morphometric differences between known male and female birds to predict the sex of unknown individuals in field studies. Geographic variation in size and shape often limits the predictive value of a discriminant function to the population from which it was derived. Specific discriminant functions for populations of five species of fulmarine petrels (Northern Fulmar, Fulmarus glacialis; Southern Fulmar, F. glacialoides; Antarctic Petrel, Thalassoica antarctica; Cape Petrel, Daption capense; and Snow Petrel, Pagodroma nivea) assigned 81 to 98% of birds in the samples to the correct sex, but the validity of each discriminant applied to alternative populations remained questionable. Our approach to overcome this limitation is to combine data from the different species into a single discriminant. Adequate performance of this generalized discriminant in samples of different species shows its validity for use in other populations of any of these species. The generalized function calculates the discriminant scores for individual fulmarine petrels as: Y = HL + 2.38BD + 0.41TL 0.21CL, where HL is head length, BD is bill depth, TL is tarsus length and CL is bill length (measurements in millimeters). The cut point to split sexes is different in each sample and may be calculated directly from discriminant scores, without reference to sexed birds, by using a maximum-likelihood method. Depending on species, the generalized method results in 84 to 97% correct classifications and can be applied to other populations of fulmarine petrels without requiring samples of birds of known sex.

Neuroanatomical Correlates of Visually Evoked Sexual Arousal in Human Males,"Brain areas activated in human male sexualbehavior have not been characterized precisely. For thefirst time, positron emission tomography (PET) was usedto identify the brain areas activated in healthy males experiencing visually evoked sexualarousal. Eight male subjects underwent six measurementsof regional brain activity following the administrationof [15O]H2O as they viewedthree categories of film clips: sexually explicit clips,emotionally neutral control clips, and humorous controlclips inducing positive but nonsexual emotions.Statistical Parametric Mapping was used to identifybrain regions demonstrating an increased activity associatedwith the sexual response to the visual stimulus.Visually evoked sexual arousal was characterized by athreefold pattern of activation: the bilateralactivation of the inferior temporal cortex, a visualassociation area; the activation of the right insula andright inferior frontal cortex, which are two paralimbicareas relating highly processed sensory information with motivational states; and the activation ofthe left anterior cingulate cortex, another paralimbicarea known to control autonomic and neuroendocrinefunctions. Activation of some of these areas was positively correlated with plasma testosteronelevels. Although this study should be consideredpreliminary, it identified brain regions whoseactivation was correlated with visually evoked sexualarousal in males.",1999,Archives of Sexual Behavior
"Granger Causality for Ill-Posed Problems: Ideas, Methods, and Application in Life Sciences.","Granger causality, based on a vector autoregressive model, is one of the most popular 
methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies between time series. The application 
of Granger causality to detect inference among a large number of variables (such as 
genes) requires a variable selection procedure. To address the lack of informative data, 
so-called regularization procedures are applied. In this chapter, we review current 
literature on Granger causality with Lasso regularization techniques for ill-posed 
problems (i.e., problems with multiple solutions). We discuss regularization procedures 
for inverse and ill-posed problems and present our recent approaches. These approaches 
are evaluated in a case study on gene regulatory networks reconstruction.",2016,
A Three-Gene Classifier Associated With MicroRNA-Mediated Regulation Predicts Prostate Cancer Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy,"Background and Objective After radical prostatectomy (RP), prostate cancer (PCa) patients may experience biochemical recurrence (BCR) and clinical recurrence, which remains a dominant issue in PCa treatment. The purpose of this study was to identify a protein-coding gene classifier associated with microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation to provide a comprehensive prognostic index to predict PCa recurrence after RP. Methods Candidate classifiers were constructed using two machine-learning algorithms (a least absolute shrinkage and selector operation [LASSO]-based classifier and a decision tree-based classifier) based on a discovery cohort (n = 156) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. After selecting the LASSO-based classifier based on the prediction accuracy, both an internal validation cohort (n = 333) and an external validation cohort (n = 100) were used to examined the classifier using survival analysis, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Functional enrichment analysis of co-expressed genes was carried out to explore the underlying moleculer mechanisms of the genes included in the classifier. Results We constructed a three-gene classifier that included FAM72B, GNE, and TRIM46, and we identified four upstream prognostic miRNAs (hsa-miR-133a-3p, hsa-miR-222-3p, hsa-miR-1301-3p, and hsa-miR-30c-2-3p). The classifier exhibited a remarkable ability (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.927) to distinguish PCa patients with high and low Gleason scores in the discovery cohort. Furthermore, it was significantly associated with clinical recurrence (p < 0.0001, log rank statistic = 20.7, AUC = 0.733) and could serve as an independent prognostic factor of recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio: 1.708, 95% CI: 1.180â€“2.472, p < 0.001). Additionally, it was a predictor of BCR according to BCR-free survival analysis (p = 0.0338, log rank statistic = 4.51). Conclusions The three-gene classifier associated with miRNA-mediated regulation may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for PCa patients after RP.",2019,Frontiers in Genetics
A new atlantasellid isopod (Asellota: Aselloidea) from the flooded coastal karst of the Dominican Republic (Hispaniola): evidence for an exopod on a thoracic limb and biogeographical implications,"A new representative of the thus far monotypic, Bermudan aselloid family Atlantasellidae is described from the freshwater layers of two coastal sinkholes on the south-west Dominican Republic, Hispaniola. Atlantasellus dominicanus sp. nov. is extraordinary among isopods in retaining a remnant of the exopod on one of its pereiopods; no other isopod is known to express a schizopodous condition of thoracic limbs. The locomotory behaviour, body volvation habits, and apparent specificity of the new taxon for life on submerged decaying wood in cave waters are described. Analysis of palaeogeographic and ecological evidence supports the interpretation of the Atlantasellidae as a thalassoid lineage, contrary to previous phylogenetically supported assumptions considering them to be an ancient, freshwater lineage.",2001,Journal of Zoology
Dialysefistelassoziiertes Stealsyndrom â€“Ist ein Fistelerhalt mÃ¶glich?,"ZusammenfassungEin dialysefistelassoziiertes Stealsyndrom (DASS) ist eine seltene Komplikation multifaktorieller Genese.

Im ersten Fall, einer akuten monomelischen Neuropathie, konnte die Fistel bei guter Handfunktion durch Fistelbanding erhalten werden, wÃ¤hrend im zweiten Fall mit dystrophischer VerÃ¤nderung weder durch ein initiales Banding noch durch die spÃ¤tere Aufhebung der Fistel eine Verbesserung des Funktionsverlustes erreicht werden konnte. Im Gegensatz zu chronischen VerÃ¤nderungen kann bei akut auftretenden Neuropathien ein Erhaltungsversuch mittels Banding indiziert sein, wobei unser Fall der erste dokumentierte seiner Art ist.AbstractDialysis fistula-associated steal syndrome (DASS) is a rare complication, with many factors involved in its origin. We present two patients with different forms of steal syndrome. In case 1, that of a patient with acute monomelic neuropathy, it was possible to conserve the fistula (by fistula banding), and good hand function was achieved. In case 2, however, that of a patient with dystrophic syndrome, neither initial banding nor later closure of the fistula led to any improvement in the defective function of the hand.

Nowhere densely generated properties in topological measure theory,"A topologicalproperty Â£Pis said to be nowhere densely generated in a class C of topological spaces if each Xg C has Â£P whenever every nowhere dense closed subset of X has Â£p[5]. For example, Katetov showed in [4] that the subspace of nonisolated points of a Tx -space X is compact if each nowhere dense closed subset is compact. This means that compactness is a nowhere densely generated property in the classof 7\-spaces without isolated points. More generally, it was showed in [1] [5] that [k, ^-compactness is also a nowhere densely generated property in the same class. Other nowhere densely generated properties were investigated in [1], a-closed-completeness, a-compactness and pseudo-(â‰ª, ^-compactness. The purpose of this paper is to consider nowhere densely generated properties in topologicalmeasure theory. In this paper we examine measurecompactness, (weak) Borel measure-completeness, Borel measure-compactness, preRadon-ness and Radon-ness. Terminologies and notations are due to [3]. we denote by <B(X) (<B*(X)) the Borel (Baire) a-algebra in a space X. A Borel (Baire) measure fiis a <7-additive non-negative real-valued set function on Â£B(X){<B*{X)). We assume that all measures are finite(i.e.ft(X)<oo). A measure ft which is fi{X)â€•\is called a probability. A Borel measure ft is called regular (Radon) if for each Bz<B{X) ft(B) is the supremum of measures of closed (compact) subsets contained to B. A nonempty family JL of sets is called directed upwards if for each A, BeJL there exists CgJI such that AuBczC. A Borel measure ftis called weakly r-additive if for each directed upwards open cover Jl of X, ft(X)=sup{ft(U): UzJl). A Borel measure ft is called r-additive if for given open subset V and a directed upwards open cover Jl of V, ft(V)=s\ip{ft(U):UzJl).

â€œI Havenâ€™t Got Time for the Painâ€: The State and Stakes of Performance Art 2.0,"REPERFORMANCE The last decade has seen a resurgence of interest in the not-so-new practice of ""reperformance,"" (1) the act of re-enacting or re-staging apparently previously performed works. LINK & PIN wondered ... why? Why reperform--or (re)perform? What are the disciplinary, ethical, authorial, contextual, and temporal dilemmas one faces in the process of reperforming? LINK & PIN's third event took place on 8-9 February 2014. Presenting Artists: SHANNON COCHRANE with FRANCESCO GAGLIARDI and MARCIN KEDZIOR LEE HENDERSON and BEE PALLOMINA HOLY JACKAL (hollyt and Jack Bride) JULIE LASSONDE BRIANNA MACLELLAN VICTORIA STANTON PAULINA WISZOWATA Writer: T. NIKKI CESARE SCHOTZKO [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] Is the camera on? / I've got a surprise for you. Last night at the bar you asked me ... what performance art was; I answered it was pure presence, in real time, without artifice ... taking necessary risks. And I wonder how one can take risks in front of a video camera. / Well, I've got a real gun. / And it's loaded. [Screen goes black.] --Guillermo Gomez-Pena, A muerte (Segundo duelo; performance) When Carrie Lambert-Beatty says she ""want[s] to believe"" in her 2010 Artforum review ""Against Performance Art,"" she is saying that she wants to believe that art might offer an efficacious alternative to political rhetoric, that ""what the world of politics won't give us, the art world will."" She wants to believe that Marina Abramovic's durational performance The Artist is Present, concurrent with the simultaneously (re)performed and embodied (and same-named) exhibition of the archive of her four-plus-decade long career, might make clear that performance art can be both cognizant of itself as a ""spectacle and personality cult"" and (still) afford an authentic and intersubjective exchange between performance and audience; and that, though Abramovic is the only ""Artist"" invoked in the performance-retrospective's title, the role itself will not be inhibited by such iconic singularity. Lambert-Beatty, though, has some doubts (208). (2) For Lambert-Beatty, the anxiety-ridden debate that erupted in 2005 over Abramovic's Seven Easy Pieces (3) is no longer so concerned with the now-anachronistic matter of liveness. In the intervening years, the ensuing conversation has become less about performance's ontology than about its temporality: [P]erformance functions differentially, relationally, centrifugally Rather than celebrating liveness (or anything else) as performance art's signal contribution, this model of performance is interested in multiple and changing temporalities. Physicality and embodiment remain important in this way of thinking about performance, but because of, and in their points of contact with, the ever-evolving forms of less material media. This is a view of performance as art's way of reorganizing itself in the twenty-first century. (211) Performance, across disciplinary and historical categorizations, is in itself predicated upon a certain conceptual and even structural overlap: a temporal stutter that allows for the possibility of many nows within new possibilities of the encounter between performance and its widely strewn audiences. ""To disappear into memory is the first step to remain in the present,"" as Andre Lepecki writes (127). But who or what is it that disappears? The ""new"" in work that is reconstructed, re-invoked, and re-enacted, that is, work that falls under the rubric of ""(re)performance,"" may be ""new"" only within the facet of immediate spectatorial engagement; encumbered by history, imagination, and memory, any ongoing conceptualization of such performance is necessarily burdened by the prefix, the ""re-,"" the already-imagined-not-quite-newness-at-all. But any work at all, no matter how original and no matter how compelling it may seem, is always already and always ever burdened by the prefix of that which has come before. â€¦",2015,Theatre Research in Canada-recherches Theatrales Au Canada
Coastal sediments from the Algarve: low-latitude climate archive for the Aptian-Albian,"The Late Aptian to Early Albian transition has previously been identified as a possible example of substantial climate cooling within the mid-Cretaceous greenhouse period. To study the response of continental weathering and terrestrial vegetation to this cooling episode at low- to mid-latitudes, marine nearshore deposits from the Algarve Basin (SW Portugal) have been investigated with a combined approach including palynology, clay mineralogy and bulk-rock geochemistry. In the Lower Aptian part of the succession, quartz-rich sandstone facies is accompanied by high abundances of early diagenetic kaolinite, which is interpreted to reflect episodes of enhanced humidity and high meteoric flow-through. In contrast, the Late Aptian to Early Albian deposits are characterized by high abundances of detrital clay minerals (mica and chlorite) indicating the dominance of physical weathering processes in the source area, most probably related to low precipitation rates in conjunction with tectonically enhanced erosion. Palynological data show a strong dominance of Classopollis pollen associated with low pteridophyte spore abundances, suggesting warm semi-arid to arid palaeoenvironments. Changes in sedimentation patterns from varicoloured lagoonal marls to thick-bedded shallow-water carbonates are neither expressed in the spore-pollen assemblages nor in the distributions of clay minerals which both remain essentially stable throughout the Late Aptian to Early Albian. These relatively stable patterns are in contrast with various lines of evidence, predominantly from high-latitude areas, that suggest a significant cooling during this time interval. Our study demonstrates that terrestrial environments of low- to mid-latitude regions were not significantly affected by the Late Aptian - Early Albian â€œcold snapâ€.",2008,International Journal of Earth Sciences
Estimating the Diffusion Source in Complex Networks with Sparse Modeling Method,"We consider the problem of estimating both the location of source and the start time of diffusion in complex networks. A sparse modeling method based on Lasso is proposed, under the condition that only a subset of nodes can be observed.

Experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in scale-free (BA) and small-world (WS) networks.",2019,
"Conduite technique et inventaire des variÃ©tÃ©s locales de figuier (Ficus carica L.) dans quatre sites de production majeures, provinces de Chefchaouen, El Jadida, Ouezzane, et Taounate","Les objectifs du present travail, mene dans quatre sites de productionÂ des figues relevant des provinces deÂ  Chefchaouen (Beni Ahmed), El Jadida (Ouled Frej), Ouezzane (Zoumi) et Taounate (Bouhouda) consistent en premier lieu a caracteriser les varietes de figuiers plantees dans ces sites; faire un diagnostic de la typologie des exploitations et de la conduite technique adoptee; et identifier les varietes potentielles pour les nouvelles plantations. Pour ce faire, nous avons realise des enquetes sur un echantillon de 72 exploitations dans differents sites, la caracterisation varietale a ete completee par le prelevement et lâ€™analyse des echantillons des fruits et des feuilles au laboratoire. Les resultats relatifs a la typologie montrent que les exploitations dont la SAU depasse 5 ha representent 20% a Ouled Frej, 11% a Bouhouda et a Beni Ahmed et seulement 5% a Zoumi. Lâ€™Ã¢ge moyen des plantations est de 15 ans a Ouled Frej, 37 ans a Zoumi et Beni Ahmed, et 43 ans a Bouhouda. La conduite technique dans le site dâ€™Ouled Frej se distingue par la pratique de lâ€™irrigation des vergers, et lâ€™apport des engrais et des produits phytosanitaires justifies par la commercialisation basee sur la vente des figues fraiches. Dans lesÂ  autres sites, la conduite est generalement traditionnelle, les figues sont vendues sechees a cause des problemes dâ€™enclavement. Le profil varietal se compose de 43 varietes dont 4 sont de type Smyrne, 18 de type Commun et 21 de type San Pedro. Le profil varietal par site est de 3 a Ouled Frej, 11 a Beni Ahmed, 11 a Bouhouda et 19 a Zoumi. Les analyses statistiques (ACP et CHA) ont montre un rapprochement entre certaines varietes qui portent des appellations differentes (synonymie). Les varietes recommandees par ordre de priorite, pour les programmes de developpement futurs du figuier, sontÂ : Messari (Homran/ Lamtel/Mtioui), Fassi, Ghouddane, Ghani et Lamdar pour la production des figues fleurs fraiches, Messari, Ghouddane, Fassi, Lassoune, Masfah, Aouad et Hamri pour la production des figues dâ€™automne a lâ€™etat frais, et Nabout, Kote, Masfah, Messari, Ghouddane et Fassi pour la production des figues dâ€™automne sechees.

Technical management and inventory of local varieties of fig trees (Ficus carica L.) in four major production sites, Chefchaouen, El Jadida, Ouezzane and Taounate provinces Â Abstract The present study conducted in four production sites belonging to the provinces of Chefchaouen (Beni Ahmed), El Jadida (Ouled Frej), Ouezzane (Zoumi) and Taounate (Bouhouda) aims to characterize the local fig varieties planted, to explore typology of the farms and training systems applied, and to identify the varieties of great value for further projects. To achieve these goals, we conducted a field survey and prospection on a sample of 72 farms in the sites considered, the characterization of the varieties was accomplished by laboratory analysis of leaf and fruit samples. Results showed that farm area having more than 5 ha represents 20% in Ouled Frej, 11% in Bouhouda and Beni Ahmed and only 5% in Zoumi. The age of fig-tree orchards averaged 15 years in Ouled Frej, 37 years in Zoumi, and Beni Ahmed and 43 years in Bouhouda. Training system is more intensive in Ouled Frej orchards by the practice of irrigation and the use of fertilizers and chemical treatments for plant protection, because almost all fruit is destined for fresh market-figs. However, in the other sites located in mountain areas, figs are mostly marketed as dried fruit, because orchards are land locked. There were 43 varieties identified, 3 in Ouled Frej, 11 in Beni Ahmed, 11 in Bouhouda and 19 in Zoumi. The Principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) have shown similarities between some varieties (synonymous). Â The varieties recommended for future fig tree development programs are: Messari (Homran / Lamtel / Mtioui), Fassi, Ghouddane, Ghani and Lamdar for the production of the first crop fresh figs; Messari, Ghouddane, Fassi. Lassoune, Masfah, Aouad and Hamri for the production of fresh autumn figs; and Nabout, Kote, Masfah, Messari, Ghouddane and Fassi Â for production of autumn dried figs.

Prediction of outcomes in mild TBI in the NTDB,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for >1.3 million ED visits and >2750,000 hospitalizations each year. Although guidelines exist for how to triage and treat these patients based on the severity of TBI, there is no clear consensus statement on which patients need intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and wide variability in practice. Many hospital guidelines currently suggest that all patients with intracranial hemorrhage of any severity be observed in ICU due to risk of decompensation and possible need for intervention. Several studies have tried to make prediction models of outcomes after head trauma. In particular, some single-center datasets have shown that certain classes of low-risk patients have low probabilities of decompensation, and so may be better observed on the hospital floor in order to conserve hospital resources. For instance, Nishijima et al used binary recursive partitioning on the UC Davis TBI-ICU data set and found that four parameters (abnormal mental status (GCS < 15), non-isolated head injury, age > 65 years, and swelling/shift on CT) was 98% sensitive and 50% specific with a ROC AUC of 0.74. Washington et al. showed that age >65 years, anticoagulation therapy, frontal contusions and high volume intracranial hemorrhage were significant predictors of decompensation, but did not evaluate their model. Overall, no consensus prediction formula exists. Thus a robust formula for clinical decision support with regard to ICU admission for mild TBI patients is needed (since moderate-severe TBI is an easier call for ICU admission); only one study to date has looked at ICU admission in mild TBI. Here the goal was to find a robust score for prediction that is also sparse. Clinicians are highly unlikely to apply a complicated rule, especially if requires input to a computer in a â€˜black-boxâ€™ model. Thus penalized linear regression was chosen, with a hypothesis that the Lasso penalty would be able to identify a sparse model for easy applicability.",2013,
Integrative analysis of multiple diverse omics datasets by sparse group multitask regression,"A variety of high throughput genome-wide assays enable the exploration of genetic risk factors underlying complex traits. Although these studies have remarkable impact on identifying susceptible biomarkers, they suffer from issues such as limited sample size and low reproducibility. Combining individual studies of different genetic levels/platforms has the promise to improve the power and consistency of biomarker identification. In this paper, we propose a novel integrative method, namely sparse group multitask regression, for integrating diverse omics datasets, platforms, and populations to identify risk genes/factors of complex diseases. This method combines multitask learning with sparse group regularization, which will: (1) treat the biomarker identification in each single study as a task and then combine them by multitask learning; (2) group variables from all studies for identifying significant genes; (3) enforce sparse constraint on groups of variables to overcome the ""small sample, but large variables"" problem. We introduce two sparse group penalties: sparse group lasso and sparse group ridge in our multitask model, and provide an effective algorithm for each model. In addition, we propose a significance test for the identification of potential risk genes. Two simulation studies are performed to evaluate the performance of our integrative method by comparing it with conventional meta-analysis method. The results show that our sparse group multitask method outperforms meta-analysis method significantly. In an application to our osteoporosis studies, 7 genes are identified as significant genes by our method and are found to have significant effects in other three independent studies for validation. The most significant gene SOD2 has been identified in our previous osteoporosis study involving the same expression dataset. Several other genes such as TREML2, HTR1E, and GLO1 are shown to be novel susceptible genes for osteoporosis, as confirmed from other studies.",2014,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology
Identification of the Anti-Infective Aborycin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster from Deep-Sea-Derived Streptomyces sp. SCSIO ZS0098 Enables Production in a Heterologous Host,"Aborycin is a ribosomally synthesized member of the type I lasso peptide natural products. In the present study, aborycin was isolated and identified from the deep-sea-derived microbe Streptomyces sp. SCSIO ZS0098. The aborycin biosynthetic gene cluster (abo) was identified on the basis of genome sequence analyses and then heterologously expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 to effectively produce aborycin. Aborycin generated in this fashion exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against 13 Staphylococcus aureus strains from various sources with minimum inhibitory concentrations MICs = 8.0~128 Âµg/mL, against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 with an MIC = 8.0 Âµg/mL, and against Bacillus thuringiensis with MIC = 2.0 Âµg/mL. Additionally, aborycin displayed potent antibacterial activity (MIC = 0.5 Âµg/mL) against the poultry pathogen Enterococcus gallinarum 5F52C. The reported abo cluster clearly has the potential to provide a means of expanding the repertoire of anti-infective type I lasso peptides.",2019,Marine Drugs
Approximation Lasso Methods for Language Modeling,"Lasso is a regularization method for parameter estimation in linear models. It optimizes the model parameters with respect to a loss function subject to model complexities. This paper explores the use of lasso for statistical language modeling for text input. Owing to the very large number of parameters, directly optimizing the penalized lasso loss function is impossible. Therefore, we investigate two approximation methods, the boosted lasso (BLasso) and the forward stagewise linear regression (FSLR). Both methods, when used with the exponential loss function, bear strong resemblance to the boosting algorithm which has been used as a discriminative training method for language modeling. Evaluations on the task of Japanese text input show that BLasso is able to produce the best approximation to the lasso solution, and leads to a significant improvement, in terms of character error rate, over boosting and the traditional maximum likelihood estimation.",2006,
Variable Selection for Nonparametric Learning with Power Series Kernels,"In this letter, we propose a variable selection method for general nonparametric kernel-based estimation. The proposed method consists of two-stage estimation: (1) construct a consistent estimator of the target function, and (2) approximate the estimator using a few variables by â„“1-type penalized estimation. We see that the proposed method can be applied to various kernel nonparametric estimation such as kernel ridge regression, kernel-based density, and density-ratio estimation. We prove that the proposed method has the property of variable selection consistency when the power series kernel is used. Here, the power series kernel is a certain class of kernels containing polynomial and exponential kernels. This result is regarded as an extension of the variable selection consistency for the nonnegative garrote (NNG), a special case of the adaptive Lasso, to the kernel-based estimators. Several experiments, including simulation studies and real data applications, show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2019,Neural Computation
Inference robust to outliers with l1-norm penalization.,"This paper considers the problem of inference in a linear regression model with outliers where the number of outliers can grow with sample size but their proportion goes to 0. We apply the square-root lasso estimator penalizing the l1-norm of a random vector which is non-zero for outliers. We derive rates of convergence and asymptotic normality. Our estimator has the same asymptotic variance as the OLS estimator in the standard linear model. This enables to build tests and confidence sets in the usual and simple manner. The proposed procedure is also computationally advantageous as it amounts to solving a convex optimization program. Overall, the suggested approach constitutes a practical robust alternative to the ordinary least squares estimator.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Solution Uniqueness of Convex Piecewise Affine Functions Based Optimization with Applications to Constrained $\ell_1$ Minimization,"In this paper, we study the solution uniqueness of an individual feasible vector of a class of convex optimization problems involving convex piecewise affine functions and subject to general polyhedral constraints. This class of problems incorporates many important polyhedral constrained $\ell_1$ recovery problems arising from sparse optimization, such as basis pursuit, LASSO, and basis pursuit denoising, as well as polyhedral gauge recovery. By leveraging the max-formulation of convex piecewise affine functions and convex analysis tools, we develop dual variables based necessary and sufficient uniqueness conditions via simple and yet unifying approaches; these conditions are applied to a wide range of $\ell_1$ minimization problems under possible polyhedral constraints. An effective linear program based scheme is proposed to verify solution uniqueness conditions. The results obtained in this paper not only recover the known solution uniqueness conditions in the literature by removing restrictive assumptions but also yield new uniqueness conditions for much broader constrained $\ell_1$-minimization problems.",2017,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Immediate UAV-enabled Infrastructure Reconnaissance following Recent Natural Disasters: Case Histories from Greece,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, represent a technological and aviation frontier that is expected to have a significant impact in numerous scientific fields. Four case histories in 2015 and 2016 of the use of UAVs equipped with high definition optical cameras for infrastructure reconnaissance following natural disasters in Greece are presented: a dam collapse due to underseepage and the consequent flooding downstream near Elassona town, a bridge failure due to bridge pier scouring near the town of Kalampaka, as well as a damaged port pier and landslides caused by the November 17th 2015 Mw 6.5 earthquake in Lefkada island. Emphasis is given on the ability of the UAVs to collect field performance data essentially immediately. In all four cases presented, data was collected remotely within 48 hrs after the event. Field data acquisition was in the order of minutes to few hours. The optical data collected was used for qualitative, as well as quantitative, assessment of field performance. For quantitative assessments, structure-from-motion was used to create 3D models. The quantity and quality of data collected is found to be significantly higher than any other available mapping technologies and, in many cases, provides unique insights on the failure mechanisms involved.",2016,
Enhanced Noisy Sparse Subspace Clustering via Reweighted L1-Minimizationâ€ ,"Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) relies on sparse regression for accurate neighbor identification. Inspired by recent progress in compressive sensing (CS), this paper proposes a new sparse regression scheme for SSC via reweighted ï¬1-minimization, which also generalizes a two-step ï¬1-minimization algorithm introduced by E. J. CandÃ¨s al all in [The Annals of Statistics, vol. 42, no. 2, pp. 669â€“699, 2014] without incurring extra complexity burden. To fully exploit the prior information conveyed by the computed sparse vector in the first step, our approach places a weight on each component of the regression vector, and solves a weighted LASSO in the second step. We discuss the impact of weighting on neighbor identification, argue that a popular weighting rule used in CS literature is not suitable for the SSC purpose, and propose a new weighting scheme for enhancing neighbor identification accuracy. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate our discussions and evidence the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Some key issues for future works are also highlighted.",2018,2018 IEEE 28th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)
"Middle Jurassic-earliest Late Cretcaeous palynofloras, coastal Tanzania","Abstract: This palynostratigraphic study of Mesozoic successions in hydrocarbon-prospective Tanzanian coastal basins utilizes cores, ditch cuttings, and outcrop samples. These contain rich and diverse dinoflagellate suites ranging in age from Middle Jurassic (Bajocian) to earliest late Cretaceous (Cenomanian). Spores and pollen grains are also recorded, but these are, with some exceptions, subordinate to the dinoflagellate components.In the systematic section, one new dinoflagellate cyst genus, Kipatimudinium, is formally described and nine new species are established: Amphorulla ruvuense, Dichadogonyaulax mandawaense, Egmontodinium annaiae, Hystrichodinium playfordii, Kipatimudinium foliatum (type species), Limbodinium patulum, Pseudoceratium redactum, Sentusidinium tanzaniensis, and Yalkalpodinium africanum.Â Six, informal, stratigraphically successive dinoflagellate assemblages are distinguished:Assemblage I (Bajocian-Bathonian); Assemblage II (Callovian); Assemblage III (Oxfordian); Assemblage IV (Kimmeridgian-Tithonian); Assemblage V (Berriasian-Barremian); and Assemblage VI (Aptian-Cenomanian).Coastal Tanzania appears referable to the Austral dinoflagellate realm due to the presence of, inter alia, Broomea ramosa, Komewuia glabra, Wanaea clathrata, and Wanaea digitata. Some minor biostratigraphic anomalies are noted, including the introduction of Glossodinium dimorphum; this is datable as early Oxfordian in Tanzania whereas in Australasia the species appears earlier (in the Callovian). A few noteworthy quantitative phenomena are evident; for instance, the abundance of Lithodinia jurassica in the vicinity of the Callovian-Oxfordian boundary and the marked increase of Wanaea spp. in the Oxfordian, specifically in the Ruvu Basin of the northern coastal belt. These events are of chronostratigraphic significance and could be applicable to regional correlation. Middle-Late Jurassic assemblages show a conspicuous degree of cosmopolitanism, and include some species previously considered to be restricted to certain regions in the low and high latitudes.The Early Cretaceous (Berriasian-Barremian) assemblages show close affinity to the Tethyan Realm. The latest Early Cretaceous (Albian) to earliest Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) strata are allied to the Albian-Cenomanian Elaterates province. The presence of elater-bearing pollen in offshore and onshore sections of Tanzania indicates that the elaterates had a wider geographic distribution than previously reported: i.e., extending beyond the northern part of the African and South American continents.The lower part of the Kipatimu Formation, which contains Assemblage IV, yielded Komewuia glabra, Broomea ramosa, and Rigaudella aemula and their presence precludes the Early Cretaceous age previously ascribed to this part of the formation. Likewise the Makonde and Mkindani Beds have yielded typically Early Cretaceous pollen grains including Classopollis braziliensis, Retitricolpites vulgaris, and Elaterocolpites castelainii.The Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary is coincident with the upper limit of Assemblage IV based on the last appearances of, in particular, Komewuia glabra and Rigaudella aemula. Within the Kipatimu Formation (as represented in wells SS-5 and SS-7), the systemic boundary appears conformable. But elsewhere in the coastal belt, the boundary is clearly unconformable.On the basis of palynostratigraphic data, significant biostratigraphic events, such as introductions and exits of certain dinoflagellate species often match sequence boundaries.From palynofacies analyses and palynostratigraphic data the Kipatimu Formation is dominated by phytoclasts indicating high terrestrial inputs during its deposition. Abundance of black wood (of high buoyancy) in the majority of samples implies high energy settings and abundance of brown wood (less buoyant) is an indication of a sudden terrestrial input into the marine system.Â The organic composition of sedimentary rocks is an important means of which the depositional history of the enclosing sediments can be understood. Different environmental settings clearly influence the character of palynofacies. For example, abundant chorate cysts (e.g., Systematophora spp.) in samples from the upper sections of SS-5 suggest open marine settings. Therefore, palynofacies analyses can be viewed as providing useful pointers to interpreting the environmental circumstances in which the rocks, in this case the Kipatimu Formation, were deposited.",2008,
Comparison of Different Methods for Handling Linkage Disequilibrium in Genetic-Association Analyses via Simulation,"Multiple makers exhibiting strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) in a single genomic region and a phenotype of interest generate very compelling statistical associations in the large-scale genetic-association studies. LD, especially strong LD, between variations at neighboring loci can not only make it difficult to discern markers associated with phenotype, but also create difficulties for distinguishing the functionally relevant variations from nonfunctional variations. In this paper, we compared 5 different methods, Boosting, LASSO, Ridge regression, Stepwise and Single locus analysis, for identifying real functional variations in the circumstance of LD exiting in the variations at different loci via simulation. We found that in the case of strong LD between 20 loci, Ridge regression performs the best while in the case of degenerated LD between 500 and 1000 loci, Boosting outperforms other methods.",2009,2009 2nd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics
Detection of pesticide (Cyantraniliprole) residue on grapes using hyperspectral sensing,"Pesticide residues in the fruits, vegetables and agricultural commodities are harmful to humans and are becoming a health concern nowadays. Detection of pesticide residues on various commodities in an open environment is a challenging task. Hyperspectral sensing is one of the recent technologies used to detect the pesticide residues. This paper addresses the problem of detection of pesticide residues of Cyantraniliprole on grapes in open fields using multi temporal hyperspectral remote sensing data. The re ectance data of 686 samples of grapes with no, single and double dose application of Cyantraniliprole has been collected by handheld spectroradiometer (MS- 720) with a wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 1052 nm. The data collection was carried out over a large feature set of 213 spectral bands during the period of March to May 2015. This large feature set may cause model over-fitting problem as well as increase the computational time, so in order to get the most relevant features, various feature selection techniques viz Principle Component Analysis (PCA), LASSO and Elastic Net regularization have been used. Using this selected features, we evaluate the performance of various classifiers such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to classify the grape sample with no, single or double application of Cyantraniliprole. The key finding of this paper is; most of the features selected by the LASSO varies between 350-373nm and 940-990nm consistently for all days. Experimental results also shows that, by using the relevant features selected by LASSO, SVM performs better with average prediction accuracy of 91.98 % among all classifiers, for all days.",2017,
Distributed Change Detection,"Change detection has traditionally been seen as a centralized problem. Many change detection problems are however distributed in nature and the need for distributed change detection algorithms is therefore significant. In this paper a distributed change detection algorithm is proposed. The change detection problem is first formulated as a convex optimization problem and then solved distributively with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). To further reduce the computational burden on each sensor, a homotopy solution is also derived. The proposed method have interesting connections with Lasso and compressed sensing and the theory developed for these methods are therefore directly applicable.",2012,IFAC Proceedings Volumes
The Climate in Growth Chamber (3),"In this paper, the influence of structural conditions of a glasshouse and of meteorological conditions on the night fall of air temperature in the glasshouse was mainly investigated by employing a solution of response function of the air temperature in the house to cuter air temperature with a quadratic time change.The time change of the inner air temperature (iTa) after the initial transient (tâ‰¥3.6Ã—103sec) was found to beiTa(t)â‰…1/P{Q0+(Q1+2b)(1/P-t)}+bt2.where Q0=PT0+Aw/CpÏVc(Af/AwB0-htfFH/0h), Q1=(aP-AfÎ±/CpÏVc), P=Aw(hf+had)/CpÏVc.Aw and Af are the wall area and the floor area, ht and had total heat transfer coefficient and ventilating heat transfer coefficient, Vc the volume of the glasshouse, oh the heat transfer coefficient at the outer surface of the wall, f the shape factor characterizing the heat loss by effective radiation, FH the effective radiation measured on a horizontal plane, a and b constants in an empirical formulae for the night fall of air temperature outside the house, B0 the soil heat flux at the time of sun set, and Î± the gradient of the time change of the soil heat flux. The above relation was used to calculate the difference (Ï„t) in air temperature between in and out the glassouse, that is the lag of air temperature in the glasshouse(see Eq. 13).The relationship between the shape factor (f) and the ratio of floor area to the wall area was studied on the basis of the equation for the effective radiation on a sloped surface. It was found out from model computation that the shape factor changes linearly with the ratio (Af/Aw) as follows;f=0.45+0.55Af/Aw.The next relation shows that the lag of air temperature (Ï„12) at the time of sun up changes proportionally to the gradient (Î±) of the time change of soil heat flux (Bsâ€²).Ï„12=4.2+0.8Â·108Î±.In the case that Î± is less than -5.25Ã—10-8, the values of the temperature lag become subsequently negative, indicating that the air temperature in the glasshouse is lower than that outside the house.The lag (Ï„12) of air temperature in the glasshouse increased in proportion to the ratio of the floor area to the wall area. The change in the lag of air temperature with the ratio (Af/Aw) was more steep in the case of the glasshouse with smaller values of the total heat transfer coefficient than in the opposite case. The following relation shows the linear dependence of the degree hour upon the lag of air temperature at the time of sun up, D.H.=12.7Ï„12.The lag (Ï„12) of the air temperature in the glasshouse decreased throughout the range of ventilation values applied and the inner air temperature approximated gradually to that outside the glasshouse, although the initial decrease is more rapid. The heat loss from unit outer glass surface by effective radiation was found to be approximated by htfFH/0h.The influence of effective radiation on the temperature environment in the glasshouse becomes remarkable with increasing the value of constant fht/0h.",1967,Journal of Agricultural Meteorology
"A-T-LAS$_{2,1}$: A Multi-Penalty Approach to Compressed Sensing of Low-Rank Matrices with Sparse Decompositions","Compressed Sensing is about recovering an unknown vector of dimension $n$ from $m \ll n$ linear measurements. This task becomes possible, for instance, when few entries of the vector have large magnitude and, hence, the vector is essentially of low intrinsic dimension. If one wishes to recover an $n_1\times n_2$ matrix instead, low-rankness can be added as sparsity structure of low intrinsic dimensionality. For this purpose we propose a novel algorithm, which we call Alternating Tikhonov regularization and Lasso (A-T-LAS$_{2,1}$). It is based on a multi-penalty regularization for recovery of low-rank matrices with approximately sparse singular vectors, which is able to leverage both structures (low-rankness and sparsity) simultaneously and effectively reduce further the number of necessary measurements with respect to the sole use of one of the two sparsity structures. We provide nearly-optimal recovery guarantees of A-T-LAS$_{2,1}$. The analysis is surprisingly relatively simple, e.g., compared to the one of other similar approaches such as Sparse Power Factorization (SPF). It relies on an adaptation of restricted isometry property to low-rank and approximately sparse matrices, LASSO technique, and results on proximal alternating minimization. We show that A-T-LAS$_{2,1}$ is more efficient than convex relaxation and exhibits similar performance to the state of the art method SPF, outperforming it in strong noise regimes and for matrices whose singular vectors do not possess exact (joint-) sparse support. Moreover, contrary to SPF, A-T-LAS$_{2,1}$, if properly initialized, is shown to converge even for measurements not fulfilling the restricted isometry property to matrices with some guaranteed sparsity and minimal discrepancy to data.",2018,arXiv: Numerical Analysis
Prediction of Time to Tumor Recurrence in Ovarian Cancer: Comparison of Three Sparse Regression Methods,"Ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecological malignancy among women. Making a reliable prediction of time to tumor recurrence would be a valuable contribution to post-surgery follow-up care. In this paper we study three well-known data sets, known as TCGA, Tothill and Yoshihara, and compare three sparse regression methods, two of which (LASSO and EN) are well-known and the third (CLOT) is from our laboratory. It is established that the three data sets are very different from each other. Therefore a two-stage predictor is built, whereby each test sample is first assigned to the most likely data set and then the corresponding predictor is used. The weighted concordance of each regression method is computed to compare the methods and select the best one. CLOT uses a biomarker panel of 103 genes and achieves a concordance index of 0.7829, which is higher than that achieved by the other two methods.",2017,
Learning dynamic temporal graphs for oil-production equipment monitoring system,"Learning temporal graph structures from time series data reveals important dependency relationships between current observations and histories. Most previous work focuses on learning and predicting with ""static"" temporal graphs only. However, in many applications such as mechanical systems and biology systems, the temporal dependencies might change over time. In this paper, we develop a dynamic temporal graphical models based on hidden Markov model regression and lasso-type algorithms. Our method is able to integrate two usually separate tasks, i.e. inferring underlying states and learning temporal graphs, in one unified model. The output temporal graphs provide better understanding about complex systems, i.e. how their dependency graphs evolve over time, and achieve more accurate predictions. We examine our model on two synthetic datasets as well as a real application dataset for monitoring oil-production equipment to capture different stages of the system, and achieve promising results.",2009,
"Photosynthetic utilisation of inorganic carbon by seagrasses from Zanzibar, East Africa","Abstract Photosynthetic rates of eight seagrass species from Zanzibar were limited by the inorganic carbon composition of natural seawater (2.1â€‰mM, mostly in the form of HCO3âˆ’), and they exhibited more than three time higher rates at inorganic carbon saturation (>6â€‰mM). The intertidal species that grew most shallowly, Halophila ovalis, Halodule wrightii and Cymodocea rotundata, showed the highest affinity for inorganic carbon (K1/2â€‰=â€‰ca. 2.5â€‰mM), followed by the subtidal species (K1/2 > 5â€‰mM). Photosynthesis of H. wrightii, C. rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata and Enhalus acoroides was >50% inhibited by acetazolamide, a membrane-impermeable inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, indicating that extracellular HCO3âˆ’ dehydration is an important part of their inorganic carbon uptake. Photosynthetic rates of H. wrightii, Thalassia hemprichii, Thalassodendron ciliatum, C. serrulata and E. acoroides were strongly reduced by changing the seawater pHâ€‰from 8.2 to 8.6 in a closed system. In H. ovalis, C. rotundata and Syringodiumisoetifolium, photosynthesis at pHâ€‰8.6 was maintained at a higher level than could be caused by the ca. 30% CO2 concentration which remained in the closed experimental systems at that pH, pointing toward HCO3âˆ’ uptake in those species. It is suggested that the ability of H. ovalis and C. rotundata to grow in the high, frequently air-exposed, intertidal zone may be related to a capability to take up HCO3âˆ’ directly, since this is a more efficient way of HCO3âˆ’ utilisation than extracellular HCO3âˆ’ dehydration under such conditions. The inability of all species to attain maximal photosynthetic rates under natural conditions of inorganic carbon supports the notion that seagrasses may respond favourably to any future increases in marine CO2 levels.",1997,Marine Biology
Cross-License Agreements in the Semiconductor Industry : Waiting to Persuade ?,"In various industries cross-licensing is considered a useful method to obtain freedom to operate and to avoid patent litigation. In this paper we study the trade-oÂ¤ between litigating and cross-licensing that Â…rms face to protect their intellectual property. We present a dynamic model of bargaining with learning in which Â…rmsÂ’ decision to litigate or cross-license depends on their capital intensity. In particular the model predicts that where Â…rmsÂ’capital intensity is higher their incentive to litigate and delay a cross-license agreement is lower. Using a novel dataset on the US Semiconductor Industry we obtain empirical results consistent with those suggested by the model. 1 Introduction During the past few years various scholars1 and industry representatives have drawn attention to speciÂ…c ineÂ¢ ciencies generated by the patent system in several industries. In particular, Shapiro (2001) has argued that a ""patent thicket"" has appeared that renders it diÂ¢ cult to commercialize new technology. In fact, in some industries the number of intellectual property rights a Â…rm requires to produce a new product is so large, and their ownership is so dispersed, that it is quite easy to unintentionally infringe on a patent. In this environment there is, therefore, a hold-up problem: when the manufacturer starts selling its product a patentee might show up threatening to shut down production unless it is paid high royalties.

Age at First Calving for Crossbreed Cows in Urban and Suburban Areas of Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso,"| Age at first calving for twenty crossbreed cows was estimated at 35.62 Â± 11.04 months by using artificial inseminations sheets and calving records on three cattle farms in urban and suburban areas of Bobo-Dioulasso. The effects of crossbreeding type, bull races, crossbreed cow generations and farm sites were analyzed. However, crossbreeds have been more precocious than the local cattles. In addition, the inseminations of Fulani zebu using Montbeliard and Alps Brown semens, the 2nd generation of crossbreed cows and the increase in farm level intensification were favourable for crossbreeds sexual precocity (p <0.05). However, to the better selection guide of cattle-breeders, calving interval and the milk production level must be assessed in order to identify the crossbreed type for optimal and profitable operations.",2016,
Bayesian semiparametric additive quantile regression,"Quantile regression provides a convenient framework for analyzing the impact of covariates on the complete conditional distribution of a response variable instead of only the mean. While frequentist treatments of quantile regression are typically completely nonparametric, a Bayesian formulation relies on assuming the asymmetric Laplace distribution as auxiliary error distribution that yields posterior modes equivalent to frequentist estimates. In this paper, we utilize a location-scale-mixture of normals representation of the asymmetric Laplace distribution to transfer different flexible modeling concepts from Gaussian mean regression to Bayesian semiparametric quantile regression. In particular, we will consider high-dimensional geoadditive models comprising LASSO regularization priors and mixed models with potentially non-normal random effects distribution modeled via a Dirichlet process mixture. These extensions are illustrated using two large-scale applications on net rents in Munich and longitudinal measurements on obesity among children.",2013,Statistical Modelling
Modeling Grouping with Recursive Auto-Associative Memory,"Modeling Grouping with Recursive Auto-Associative Memory Andreas Hansson (andreas.hansson@ida.his.se) Department of Computer Science, University of Skovde, Box 408 541 28 Skovde, Sweden Lars F. Niklasson (lars.niklasson@ida.his.se) Department of Computer Science, University of Skovde, Box 408 541 28 Skovde, Sweden Abstract Sometimes humans have a need for storing long sequences of information in memory. Several experiments show that grouping the items in the sequence helps storing the sequence in auditory short-term memory. One architecture used by connectionist cognitive researchers when representing and processing sequences is Recursive Auto-Associative Memory. One of the aspects of it is that its capacity for storing sequences is limited, leading to that the longer the sequence the less likely it is that the entire sequence can be recalled; the deepest parts of the sequence are forgotten. Two experiments are performed to test if grouping affects storage in Recursive Auto-Associative Memories. We conclude that grouping affects the ability for storing sequences in Recursive Auto- Associative Memories much in the same way as it affects the human auditory short-term memory, i.e., using grouping increase the probability of that the sequence can be recalled correctly . Introduction One technique for studying how memory is constructed is serial recall (see for example Baddeley, 1999 and Bridges and Jones, 1996; Pickering, Gathercole, Hall and Lloyd, 2001). A sequence of items (for example objects, digits, letters, etc.) is presented to the research subjects. The task for the subjects is to recall all items in the sequence in the same order as they were presented. One of the aspects studied using serial recall tasks is how to increase the ability of the subjects to recall longer sequences. Martin and Fernberger (1929) performed such a study regarding the improvement of auditory short-term memory. They concluded that the ability to remember sequences increased, if the objects in the sequence were organized in groups. Wickelgren (1964) and Pollack, Johnson and Knaff (1959) among others later confirmed this. Grouping entails that the sequence is divided into shorter sub-sequences. The actual grouping has in previous experiments been done in two ways. Either the size of the groups is decided by the experiment leader (cf. Wickelgren (1964); Pollack, Johnson and Knaff (1959)) or the size of the groups is selected by the subjects and can vary within a sequence (cf. Martin and Fernberger (1929); Baumann and Trouvain (2001)). Inspired by the findings of Martin and Fernberger (1929); Pollack, Johnson and Knaff (1959) and Wickelgren (1964), that grouping can increase the ability to recall longer sequences, the interest here is to test how grouping affect the recall of sequences in Pollackâ€™s (1990) Recursive Auto- Associative Networks (RAAMs). A RAAM is a type of artificial neural network used for representing sequences and structures of unknown or dynamical size. It has previously been used in experiments involving manipulation of structured objects (e.g. sentence transformation (Chalmers, 1990), language translation (Chrisman, 1991). These experiments showed that RAAM uses the sequential order of the presented objects to develop highly structured (spatial) internal representations. In the experiments presented in the following a variant of these networks, called Extended Recursive Auto-associative Networks (ERAAM), originally suggested by Niklasson and Sharkey (1992), will be used. Grouping experiments The exact definition of what a group is varies. According to Wickelgren (1964), Fraisse (1945) defined a group as a cluster of correct items separated by one or more errors. Wickelgren noted that this way of defining groups assumes that the items in a group are rarely forgotten and that the subjects practically never can remember two groups in succession. Others, for example Baumann and Trouvain (2001), used rhythm of speech and intonations for finding groups when the subjects recalled the sequences. Wickelgren defined a grouping method as a method for rehearsal, i.e. grouping in twos means rehearsing the items in twos; grouping in threes means rehearsing the items in threes; etc. A large number experiments on how grouping affects the ability to recall longer sequences have been conducted. Most of these experiments confirm each other in that they show similar results. Martin and Fernberger (1929) trained subjects to remember long sequences. This was achieved by the subjects using increasingly larger groups (first the subjects used groups of size two, after a while groups of size three and so on). Martin and Fernberger noted that the performance increased up to groups of size 5, after that the performance decreased.",2002,
Tectonic types of deepwater basins and structural segmentation of the North Atlantic,"Typification of tectonic structures is one of the important lines of tectonic research. Recently, I have published several articles, which are concerned with deepwater oceanic basins. This paper is focused on tectonic typification of deepwater basins of the North Atlantic. They are attributed to three types: perispreading, central thalassogenic, and pericontinental. The first type comprises the Irminger, Iceland, Greenland, and Lofoten basins. The first two basins are associated with the Reykjanes Ridge and the two others, with the Mohns Ridge. The central thalassogenic type is exemplified in the Norwegian Basin, while the pericontinental type in the Rockall Trough. Two systems of basins are distinguished by morphostructural and historical-geological features: the northern system of the Oligocene-Quaternary structures and the southern system of the Paleocene-Quaternary structures. The Greenland-Faroe tectonovolcanic zone serves as their tectonic interface. In the tectonic typology of their deepwater basins, the North Atlantic is closer to the Indian than to other oceans. The present-day configuration of the northern basins is determined by neotectonics. The tectonic movements in the northern system of basins at this stage were more contrasting than in the southern system. This explains the greater depth of the former basins. The spatial position of the deepwater basins belonging to different types determines the tectonic segmentation of the oceanic bottom. The southern, central, and northern latitudinal segments correspond to different geodynamic states of the Earthâ€™s interior.",2012,Geotectonics
Significado paleoambiental da famÃ­lia anemiaceae no cretÃ¡ceo do Brasil: inferÃªncias a partir de dados palinolÃ³gicos,"This paper discusses the paleoenvironmental value of the Family Anemiaceae from analyses of Cretaceous palynological assemblages containing spores belonging to the genus Cicatricosisporites. The analyzed samples are from Cretaceous units of several Brazilian sedimentary basins - Sanfranciscan Basin, Parnaiba Basin, Parana Basin, Almada Basin and Pernambuco-Paraiba Basin. In the Areado and Codo formations, respectively from the Sanfranciscan and Parnaiba basins, the occurrence of terrestrial palynomorphs and abundant Classopollis pollen grains - isolated and in tetrads - indicates continental deposition close to the source area in a dry, hot climate. Cicatricosisporites, when not highly represented statistically in these formations, could suggest incompatibility with dry and hot conditions. However, some samples of the Codo Formation are characterized by the absence of Classopollis and the abundance of psilate and ornamented trilete spores - including Cicatricosisporites and Perotriletes. The latter suggests the existence of relatively humid periods with locally higher water availability. In the sample from the Bauru Group (Parana Basin), only one specimen of Cicatricosisporites was observed among abundant ephedroid pollen grains (indicating an arid environment) and zonate and cingulate trilete spores (indicating a humid environment). This may suggest seasonal alternation in rainfall. In the Urucutuca (Almada basin) and Gramame (Pernambuco-Paraiba Basin) formations, the presence of palynoforaminifera and dinoflagellate cysts indicates marine depositional conditions, although continental palynomorphs co-occur. In the Urucutuca Formation, Cicatricosisporites constitutes the most abundant of the continental palynomorphs. We conclude that Cicatricosisporites can indicate a moderately humid climate from its frequent association with psilate and ornamented trilete spores and with Perotriletes, which indicates local standing water. Furthermore, Cicatricosisporites has generally low quantitative representation, when it occurs in association with indicators of dry climate.",2012,
Regularization for Cox's Proportional Hazards Model with Np-dimensionality.,"High throughput genetic sequencing arrays with thousands of measurements per sample and a great amount of related censored clinical data have increased demanding need for better measurement specific model selection. In this paper we establish strong oracle properties of non-concave penalized methods for non-polynomial (NP) dimensional data with censoring in the framework of Cox's proportional hazards model. A class of folded-concave penalties are employed and both LASSO and SCAD are discussed specifically. We unveil the question under which dimensionality and correlation restrictions can an oracle estimator be constructed and grasped. It is demonstrated that non-concave penalties lead to significant reduction of the ""irrepresentable condition"" needed for LASSO model selection consistency. The large deviation result for martingales, bearing interests of its own, is developed for characterizing the strong oracle property. Moreover, the non-concave regularized estimator, is shown to achieve asymptotically the information bound of the oracle estimator. A coordinate-wise algorithm is developed for finding the grid of solution paths for penalized hazard regression problems, and its performance is evaluated on simulated and gene association study examples.",2011,Annals of statistics
"The Usage of Lasso, Ridge, and Linear Regression to Explore the Most Influential Metabolic Variables that Affect Fasting Blood Sugar in Type 2 Diabetes Patients","Abstract Background and aims: To explore the most influential variables of fasting blood sugar (FBS) with three regression methods, to identify the existence chance of type 2 diabetes based on influential variables with logistic regression (LR), and to compare the three regression methods according to Mean Squared Error (MSE) value. Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 270 patients suffering from type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months and 380 healthy people were participated. The Linear regression, Ridge regression, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) regression were used to find influential variables for FBS. Results: Among 15 variables (8 metabolic, 7 characteristic), Lasso regression selected HbA1c, Urea, age, BMI, heredity, and gender, Ridge regression selected HbA1c, heredity, gender, smoking status, and drug use, and Linear regression selected HbA1c as the most effective predictors for FBS. Conclusion: HbA1c is the most influential predictor of FBS among 15 variables according to the result of three regression methods. Controlling the variation of HbA1c leads to a more stable FBS. Beside FBS that should be checked before breakfast, maybe HbA1c could be helpful in diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes.",2019,Romanian Journal of Diabetes Nutrition and Metabolic Diseases
Frequency of recurrence of atrial fibrillation within 48 hours after ablation and its impact on long-term outcome.,"Because of delayed structural and electrophysiologic effects of radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF), early recurrence of AF after ablation does not necessarily indicate long-term ablation failure. This study was intended to assess the prognostic value of early recurrence of AF within 48 hours after ablation. The study included 234 patients (aged 23 to 80 years; 72% men) with symptomatic drug-resistant paroxysmal (n = 165) or persistent AF (n = 69) who underwent either Lasso-guided segmental pulmonary vein isolation (n = 83) or CARTO-guided left atrial circumferential ablation (n = 151). After a median follow-up of 12.7 months, 64% of patients with paroxysmal and 45% of patients with persistent AF were AF free. Early recurrence of AF occurred in 43% of patients and was more frequently observed in the persistent-AF group (paroxysmal vs persistent 39% vs 54%; p = 0.037). Early recurrence of AF was a significant predictor of long-term ablation failure in univariate (hazard ratio [HR] 2.29, p <0.001) and multivariate (HR 2.17. p <0.001) Cox regression analysis. Nevertheless, 46% of patients with early recurrence of AF were AF free during long-term follow-up compared with 68% of patients without early recurrence of AF. The prognostic value of early recurrence of AF was found in patients with paroxysmal (HR 2.05, p = 0.005) and persistent AF (HR 2.35, p = 0.013). In conclusion, early recurrence of AF within 48 hours after ablation was a significant predictor of a poor long-term ablation outcome. However, because nearly half the patients with early recurrence of AF remained AF free during long-term follow-up, early recurrence of AF should not automatically result in an early repeated procedure.",2008,The American journal of cardiology
Sparse EEG/MEG source estimation via a group lasso,"Non-invasive recordings of human brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencelphalography (MEG) are of value for both basic science and clinical applications in sensory, cognitive, and affective neuroscience. Here we introduce a new approach to estimating the intra-cranial sources of EEG/MEG activity measured from extra-cranial sensors. The approach is based on the group lasso, a sparse-prior inverse that has been adapted to take advantage of functionally-defined regions of interest for the definition of physiologically meaningful groups within a functionally-based common space. Detailed simulations using realistic source-geometries and data from a human Visual Evoked Potential experiment demonstrate that the group-lasso method has improved performance over traditional â„“2 minimum-norm methods. In addition, we show that pooling source estimates across subjects over functionally defined regions of interest results in improvements in the accuracy of source estimates for both the group-lasso and minimum-norm approaches.",2017,PLoS ONE

BITSANIS, FORTH-IESL â€” In dense suspensions of multi-arm star polymers a â€œreversible thermal vitrificationâ€ was observed experimentally under â€œmarginalâ€ solvent conditions. We have investigated the origin of this phenomenon via MD simulations at the mesoscopic scale1,2,. We reported the emergence of an amorphous solid state, upon heating of the â€œsoft spheresâ€. This transient glassy state resulted from star swelling, â€œfree volumeâ€ deprivation and â€œdynamical arrestâ€ of â€œsoft-spheresâ€. We monitored the ageing of the amorphous stage towards more crystalline FCC structures. The effects of size-dispersity and arm MW on crystallization were studied qualitatively. The overall picture revealed the existence of new â€œdynamically arrestedâ€ states, all of which could be termed â€œcrystallineâ€ but differed as to the â€œdegree of crystallinityâ€. Quantitative analysis of particle trajectories supplied mean square displacement curves which at the higher temperatures are typical of â€œdelayedâ€ Fickian diffusion. Even the aged crystalline states exhibited weak diffusion in contrast with the null diffusion of the crystals resulting from a FCC initial configuration. 1 Rissanou et al., Phys. Rev.

Improved Assessment of Hepatic Steatosis in Humans Using Multi-Parametric Quantitative Ultrasound,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects ~25% of the world population. Confounder-corrected chemical-shift-encoded MRI-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) is an established quantitative noninvasive biomarker of hepatic steatosis but has limited availability. There is a clinical need for more practical and accessible methods to noninvasively assess hepatic steatosis. Previous work has shown that two quantitative ultrasound (QUS) biomarkers - attenuation coefficient (AC) and backscatter coefficient (BSC) - are correlated with hepatic steatosis. Examining a broad range of QUS biomarkers, this study aims to develop an improved, multi-parametric QUS-based approach to diagnose NAFLD and quantify hepatic fat, with MRI-PDFF as the reference standard. 102 participants recruited from the UCSD NAFLD Research Center underwent QUS exams on the right liver lobe with an Acuson S3000 ultrasound scanner and the 4C1 and 6C1HD transducers. Seven QUS biomarkers - AC, BSC, three Lizzi-Feleppa parameters (slope, intercept, midband), and two envelope parameters (k and Î¼) - were derived from ultrasound radiofrequency data. Two multivariable models were developed based on QUS biomarkers: a generalized linear regression model to predict hepatic PDFF using stepwise regression for biomarker selection and a regularized logistic regression model to classify NAFLD (MRI-PDFF>5%, N=78/102) versus no NAFLD (MRI-PDFFâ‰¤5%) using LASSO regularization for biomarker selection. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed. The final regression model selected the midband and k-parameter. The cross-validated predicted PDFF values were correlated with the reference MRI-PDFF values (Spearman Ï = 0.82 and Pearsonâ€™s r = 0.76). In comparison, Pearsonâ€™s r was 0.59 between AC and MRI-PDFF and 0.58 between BSC and MRI-PDFF. The final classifier model selected the midband, k-parameter and Î¼-parameter, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88. In comparison, AUROC was 0.83 using AC and 0.84 using BSC. The results suggest that multi-parametric QUS can improve the quantification of hepatic steatosis and diagnosis of NAFLD.",2019,2019 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)
Discriminatively Trained Sparse Inverse Covariance Matrices for Speech Recognition,"We propose to use acoustic models with sparse inverse covariance matrices to deal with the well-known over-fitting problem of discriminative training, especially when training data are limited. Compared with traditional diagonal or full covariance models, significant improvement by using sparse inverse covariance matrices has been achieved with maximum likelihood training. In state-of-the-art large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems, discriminative training is commonly employed to achieve the best system performance. This paper investigates training acoustic models with sparse inverse covariance matrices using one of the most widely used discriminative training criteria-maximum mutual information (MMI). A lasso regularization term is added to the traditional objective function for MMI to automatically sparsify the inverse covariance matrices. The whole training process is then derived by maximizing the new objective function. This is achieved through iteratively maximizing a weak-sense auxiliary function. The final problem is shown to be a convex optimization problem and can be efficiently solved. Experimental results on the published Wall Street Journal and our collected Mandarin data sets show that the acoustic models with sparse inverse covariance matrices consistently outperform the conventional diagonal and full covariance models.",2014,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing"
Selecting the LASSO regularization parameter via Bayesian principles,"We investigate the Bayesian interpolation method for estimator selection, and apply it to the problem of regularization parameter selection in Ridge and LASSO regressions. Specifically, the Bayesian interpolation method leads to criteria for choosing the Ridge and LASSO regularizations; the criterion for LASSO is novel. We show that our proposed technique gives comparable and sometimes superior performance compared with other methods like the Generalized Cross Validation (GCV), the extended Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the extended Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).",2016,2016 IEEE International Conference on the Science of Electrical Engineering (ICSEE)
Metal concentrations in certain coastal organisms from Beirut,"Trace metal concentrations were determined in six species of intertidal organisms common to the coast of Ras Beirut, Lebanon. Lead, cadmium, nickel, iron, and zinc were highest in the polychaete,Hermodice carunculata, but the eggs of the sea urchin,Arbacia lixula, had similar iron levels and the sea anemone,Actinia equina, had zinc concentrations which also approached levels in the polychaete. The highest copper occurred in the shore crab,Pachygrapsus transversus, while chromium was highest in the eggs ofArbacia lixula.Cystoseira spinosa, the only alga studied, had average copper and iron concentrations similar to those found in the same species in another study. Together with the sea urchin eggs,C. spinosa exhibited the most variable zinc levels in the present investigation. The fish,Thalassoma pavo, which is rather common along the rocky coastal areas of Lebanon, appeared to have fairly high concentrations of certain elements in relation to levels reported in species of fish from other locations.Sewage, garbage, industrial and agricultural waste materials all enter the Mediterranean from Lebanon without prior treatment, which along with increased land erosion, probably contribute substantially to the availability of metals to the biota studied. It is suggested that more work on trace elements in coastal organisms from the eastern Mediterranean basin be undertaken before any conclusive statements are made. Such work should also investigate the various physiological and biochemical factors involved in metal uptake and retention by each species.",2004,Hydrobiologia
Dietary Habits and Cooking Methods Could Reduce Avoidable Exposure to PCBs in Maternal and Cord Sera,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), like other persistent organic pollutants, are accumulating throughout the food chain and pose health threats to humans, especially children and foetuses. There is no protocol for reducing the contamination levels of the PCBs in humans. This study identified food items and cooking methods that reduce serum PCB levels by analysing data collected from the Chiba Study of Mother and Child Health. The sample size was 194 subjects. Serum PCB levels were measured using gas chromatographyâ€“electron capture negative ionization quadrupole mass spectrometry. Information on dietary habits was obtained from a brief diet history questionnaire that included questions about food items and cooking methods. Food items were categorized into food groups, and nutrient levels were calculated based on food item consumption. Principal component analysis and lasso regression were used as statistical methods. The analyses of food items and nutrients suggested that food items rich in dietary fibre reduce avoidable exposure to PCBs, as could grilling and deep frying of food, which could reduce avoidable exposure to serum PCBs in mothers and foetuses.

Investigating structural and occupant drivers of annual residential electricity consumption using regularization in regression models,"Abstract Achieving further reductions in building electricity usage requires a detailed characterization of electricity consumption in homes. Understanding drivers of consumption can inform strategies for promoting conservation and efficiency. While there exist numerous approaches for modeling building energy demand, the use of regularization methods in statistical models can address challenges inherent to building energy modeling while also enabling more accurate predictions and better identification of variables that influence consumption. This paper applies five regularization techniques to regression models of original survey and electricity consumption data for more than one thousand households in California. It finds that of these, elastic net and two extensions of the lassoâ€”group lasso and adaptive lassoâ€”outperform other approaches in terms of prediction accuracy and model interpretability. These findings contribute to methodological approaches for modeling energy consumption in buildings as well as to our understanding of key drivers of consumption. The paper shows that while structural factors predominate in explaining annual electricity consumption patterns, habitual actions taken to save energy in the home are important for reducing consumption while pro-environmental attitudes and energy literacy are not. Implications for improving building energy modeling and for informing demand reduction strategies are discussed in the context of the low-carbon transition.",2019,Energy
Antiretroviral therapy among high-risk women in Burkina Faso:adherence issues and parallel therapeutic resources,"Background: Recent initiatives have facilitated the access to antiretroviral treatments (ART) in Africa. Such long-term therapy may turn difficult to implement in hard-toreach and marginalized populations who are only used to short-term treatments prescribed for acute infections. Parallel therapeutic resources (traditional medicine, therapeutic prayer, etc...) can complicate the relationships with modern medicine. The aim of this work is to understand the effect of psychological and cultural determinants on parallel resources behaviours, and to study its relationship with ART therapy. Methods: This qualitative study enrolled HIV-infected women, treated or not with ART, from a cohort of high-risk women in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. A face-to-face questionnaire was administered about their perception of HIV disease, the psychological problems they meet, the type of parallel therapeutic resources they used and their level of ART adherence for the ones. Results: A total of 44 women were enrolled, including 17 taking ART. Overall, 30 reported 39 parallel resources. The use of parallel therapeutic resources was determined by HIV disease perception. Among women taking ART, adherence seemed altered by parallel therapies (4/7 women with low adherence used parallel therapeutic resources, and 5/7 women with low adherence were from people living with HIV associations. Conclusions: Decision of use parallel therapeutic resources is mainly influenced by the way women perceive their HIV disease. This therapeutics has negative effects on adherence to ART and women from people living with HIV associations have ART adherence difficulties, stressing the need of psychological support to HIV-infected individuals in Africa. It may help them modulate their disease perception and thereby their adherence to ART.",2008,
[Study of Algorithms Reconstructing Gene Regulatory Network with Resampling and Conditional Mutual Information].,"Reconstruction of gene regulatory networks(GRNs)from large-scale expression data can mine the potential causality relationship among the genes and help understand the complex regulatory mechanisms.It is of utmost interest and has become a challenging computational problem for understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms in cellular systems.For the past decades,numerous theoretical and computational approaches have been introduced for inferring the GRNs.However,all existing methods of inferring GRNs from gene expression profiles have their strengths and weaknesses.In particular,many properties of GRNs,such as topology sparseness and non-linear dependence,are generally in regulation mechanism but are seldom taken into account simultaneously in one computational method.Some information theory algorithms do not recover the true positive edges that may have been deleted in an earlier computing process.These interaction relationships may reflect the actual relationship of genes.To overcome these disadvantages and to further enhance the precision and robustness of inferred GRNs,we presented an ensemble method,to infer GRNs from gene expression data by adopting two strategies of resampling and arithmetic mean fusion in this work.In this algorithm,the jackknife resampling procedure was first employed to form a series of sub-datasets of gene expression data,then the conditional mutual information was used to generate the corresponding sub-networks from the sub-datasets,and the final GRN was inferred by integrating these sub-networks with an arithmetic mean fusion strategy.Compared with those of the state-of-the-art algorithm on the benchmark synthetic GRNs datasets from the DREAM3 challenge and a real SOS DNA repair network,the results show that our method outperforms significantly LP,LASSO and ARANCE methods,and has a high and robust performance.",2016,Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi

"Iteratively Reweighted <named-content content-type=""math"" xlink:type=""simple""><inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell_1$</tex-math></inline-formula> </named-content> Approaches to Sparse Composite Regularization","Motivated by the observation that a given signal x admits sparse representations in multiple dictionaries Î¨d but with varying levels of sparsity across dictionaries, we propose two new algorithms for the reconstruction of (approximately) sparse signals from noisy linear measurements. Our first algorithm, Co-L1, extends the well-known lasso algorithm from the L1 regularizer âˆ¥Î¨xâˆ¥1 to composite regularizers of the form Î£d Î»d âˆ¥Î¨dx1 while self-adjusting the regularization weights Î»d. Our second algorithm, Co-IRW-L1, extends the well-known iteratively reweighted L1 algorithm to the same family of composite regularizers. We provide several interpretations of both algorithms: 1) majorization-minimization (MM) applied to a nonconvex log-sum-type penalty; 2) MM applied to an approximate Bo-type penalty; 3) MM applied to Bayesian MAP inference under a particular hierarchical prior; and 4) variational expectation maximization (VEM) under a particular prior with deterministic unknown parameters. A detailed numerical study suggests that our proposed algorithms yield significantly improved recovery SNR when compared to their noncomposite L1 and IRW-L1 counterparts.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging
On gene mapping with the mixture model and the extremes,"We introduce a new variable selection method, suitable when the correlation between regressors is known. It is appropriate in genomics since once the genetic map has been built, the correlation is perfectly known. Our method, based on the LASSO , is original since the number of selected variables is bounded by the number of predictors, instead of being bounded by the number of observations as in the classical LASSO. It is made possible by the construction of a specific statistical test, a transformation of the data and by the knowledge of the correlation between regressors. We prove that the signal to noise ratio is largely increased by considering the extremes. This new technique is inspired by stochastic processes arising from statistical genetics. It is described in a statistical genetics context, considering a large panel of models present in the literature. Our method is insensitive to interactions between regressors. An illustration on simulated data is given.",2018,
An evaluation of penalised survival methods for developing prognostic models with rare events.,"Prognostic models for survival outcomes are often developed by fitting standard survival regression models, such as the Cox proportional hazards model, to representative datasets. However, these models can be unreliable if the datasets contain few events, which may be the case if either the disease or the event of interest is rare. Specific problems include predictions that are too extreme, and poor discrimination between low-risk and high-risk patients. The objective of this paper is to evaluate three existing penalised methods that have been proposed to improve predictive accuracy. In particular, ridge, lasso and the garotte, which use penalised maximum likelihood to shrink coefficient estimates and in some cases omit predictors entirely, are assessed using simulated data derived from two clinical datasets. The predictions obtained using these methods are compared with those from Cox models fitted using standard maximum likelihood. The simulation results suggest that Cox models fitted using maximum likelihood can perform poorly when there are few events, and that significant improvements are possible by taking a penalised modelling approach. The ridge method generally performed the best, although lasso is recommended if variable selection is required.",2012,Statistics in medicine
Adaptive lasso-type estimation for multivariate diffusion processes,"The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is a widely used statistical methodology for simultaneous estimation and variable selection. It is a shrinkage estimation method that allows one to select parsimonious models. In other words, this method estimates the redundant parameters as zero in the large samples and reduces variance of estimates. In recent years, many authors analyzed this technique from a theoretical and applied point of view. We introduce and study the adaptive LASSO problem for discretely observed multivariate diffusion processes. We prove oracle properties and also derive the asymptotic distribution of the LASSO estimator. This is a nontrivial extension of previous results by Wang and Leng (2007, Journal of the American Statistical Association , 102(479), 1039â€“1048) on LASSO estimation because of different rates of convergence of the estimators in the drift and diffusion coefficients. We perform simulations and real data analysis to provide some evidence on the applicability of this method.",2012,Econometric Theory
Applying Cooperative Coevolution To Inventory Control Parameter Optimization,"The investment in inventory typically represents one of the largest single uses of capital in a business. Inventory control, which is concerned with the management of this investment, therefore becomes one of the most important functions in a business. Two decisions that need to be made in managing inventories are how much to order and when to order. These two decisions can be made routinely using a decision rule for placing an order for a xed quantity whenever the stock level reaches a reorder point. E ective use of this decision rule involves determining the optimum decision rule parameter values, in this case the optimum order quantity and reorder point that minimize the total cost resulting from inventory decisions. In this dissertation, cooperative coevolutionary genetic algorithms (CCGAs) are applied to inventory control parameter optimization, an area in which there is currently a lack of work on exploring the potential usefulness of evolutionary algorithms. Unlike standard genetic algorithms, CCGAs evolve multiple subpopulations which have to cooperate to achieve a common goal. Results are presented showing that CCGAs outperform standard genetic algorithms as well as traditional methods when applied to inventory control parameter optimization problems. This dissertation also show how the CCGAs described by Potter and De Jong can be extended and modi ed in order to handle larger inventory control optimization problems. iii Acknowledgements First I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Ajit Narayanan (University of Exeter) who encouraged me to investigate inventory control using evolutionary algorithms.

TEDAS - Tail Event Driven ASset Allocation,"Portfolio selection and risk management are very actively studied topics in quantitative finance and applied statistics. They are closely related to the dependency structure of portfolio assets or risk factors. The correlation structure across assets and opposite tail movements are essential to the asset allocation problem, since they determine the level of risk in a position. Correlation alone is not informative on the distributional details of the assets. By introducing TEDAS -Tail Event Driven ASset allocation, one studies the dependence between assets at different quantiles. In a hedging exercise, TEDAS uses adaptive Lasso based quantile regression in order to determine an active set of negative non-zero coefficients. Based on these active risk factors, an adjustment for intertemporal correlation is made. Finally, the asset allocation weights are determined via a Cornish-Fisher Value-at-Risk optimization. TEDAS is studied in simulation and a practical utility-based example using hedge fund indices.",2014,
"Fine mapping and single nucleotide polymorphism effects estimation on pig chromosomes 1, 4, 7, 8, 17 and X","Fine mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) from previous linkage studies was performed on pig chromosomes 1, 4, 7, 8, 17, and X which were known to harbor QTL. Traits were divided into: growth performance, carcass, internal organs, cut yields, and meat quality. Fifty families were used of a F2 population produced by crossing local Brazilian Piau boars with commercial sows. The linkage map consisted of 237 SNP and 37 microsatellite markers covering 866 centimorgans. QTL were identified by regression interval mapping using GridQTL. Individual marker effects were estimated by Bayesian LASSO regression using R. In total, 32 QTL affecting the evaluated traits were detected along the chromosomes studied. Seven of the QTL were known from previous studies using our F2 population, and 25 novel QTL resulted from the increased marker coverage. Six of the seven QTL that were significant at the 5% genome-wide level had SNPs within their confidence interval whose effects were among the 5% largest effects. The combined use of microsatellites along with SNP markers increased the saturation of the genome map and led to smaller confidence intervals of the QTL. The results showed that the tested models yield similar improvements in QTL mapping accuracy.",2013,Genetics and Molecular Biology
Model selection strategies in genome-wide association studies,"Unravelling the genetic architecture of common diseases is a continuing challenge in human genetics. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven to be successful in identifying many new disease susceptibility loci, the extension of these studies beyond single-SNP methods of analysis has been limited. The incorporation of multi-locus methods of analysis may, however, increase the power of GWAS to detect genes of smaller effect size, as well as genes that interact with each other and the environment. This investigation carried out large-scale simulations of four multi-locus model selection techniques; namely forward and backward selection, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and least angle regression with a lasso modification (lasso), in order to compare the type I error rates and power of each method. At a type I error rate of ~5%, lasso showed the highest power across varied effect sizes, disease frequencies and genetic models. Lasso penalized regression was then used to perform three different types of analysis on GWAS data. Firstly, lasso was applied to the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data and identified many of the WTCCC SNPs that had a moderate-strong association (p<10-5) type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as some of the moderate WTCCC associations (p<10-4) that have since been replicated in a large-scale meta-analysis. Secondly, lasso was used to fine-map the 17q21 childhood asthma risk locus and identified putative secondary signals in the 17q21 region, that may further contribute to childhood asthma risk. Finally, lasso identified three potential interaction effects potentially contributing towards coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. While the validity of these findings hinges on their replication in follow-up studies, the results suggest that lasso may provide scientists with exciting new methods of dissecting, and ultimately understanding, the complex genetic framework underlying common human diseases.",2011,Genetic Epidemiology
MultiPass lasso algorithms for sparse signal recovery,"We develop the MultiPass Lasso (MPL) algorithm for sparse signal recovery. MPL applies the Lasso algorithm in a novel, sequential manner and has the following important attributes. First, MPL improves the estimation of the support of the sparse signal by combining high quality estimates of its partial supports which are sequentially recovered via the Lasso algorithm in each iteration/pass. Second, the algorithm is capable of exploiting the dynamic range in the nonzero magnitudes. Preliminary theoretic analysis shows the potential performance improvement enabled by MPL over Lasso. In addition, we propose the Reweighted MultiPass Lasso algorithm which substitutes Lasso with MPL in each iteration of Reweighted l1 Minimization. Experimental results favorably support the advantages of the proposed algorithms in both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency, thereby supporting the potential of the MultiPass framework for algorithmic development.",2011,2011 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings
Inactivation of Cell-Associated and Cell-Free HIV-1 by Flash-Heat Treatment of Breast Milk,"To the Editors: Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is responsible annually for approximately 90% of the 370,000 newly acquired HIV infections in children younger than 15 years, of which 90% are in sub-Saharan Africa. Current World Health Organization recommendations state that HIV-positive mothers should breast-feed exclusively for 6 months unless replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, in which case avoidance of all breast-feeding is recommended. Cessation of breast-feeding should occur at 6 months only if a nutritionally adequate and safe diet is maintained, yet practical feeding alternatives that meet these criteria are frequently not available. In contrast to the estimated 200,000â€“350,000 infants who contract HIV through breast-feeding each year, WHO estimates that 1.5 million infants died because they were not breast-fed. Safe and nutritious feeding options are needed for these vulnerable infants. Heat treatment of breast milk is one of the methods recommended by WHO. We previously reported that flash-heat (FH), a simple in-home pasteurization method for use in developing countries (see below), is capable of inactivating cellfree HIV in â€˜â€˜HIV-spikedâ€™â€™ breast milk samples, as detected by reverse transcriptase assays, while retaining the milkâ€™s nutritional, immunological, and antimicrobial properties. However, Becquart et al has found that cellassociated HIV, which includes latently infected resting CD4 T lymphocytes, is a significant source of transmissible virus. This is further supported by the occurrence of transmission to the infant that is seen even after controlling for low levels of cell-free virus. Our previous studies have shown that FH reduces reverse transcriptase activity to undetectable levels. Reverse transcriptase is a surrogate for infectivity because it is necessary but not sufficient for viral infectivity. Due to the limitations of this assay for detecting provirus or cell-associated virus, further investigation to determine true infectivity was needed. We performed multiple assays to comprehensively assess FH inactivation of cell-free and cell-associated HIV. Breast milk samples were spiked with â€˜â€˜cell-associated virusâ€™â€™ (infected cells), which included integrated latent viral genome and virus that has shed from the surface of cells and new progeny in the process of assembly. The virus used was HIV-1 clade C strain ZA12, grown in the continuous human T-Cell line â€˜â€˜PM-1.â€™â€™ Five breast milk samples were collected from healthy volunteer mothers in California, United States, and stored frozen at 70(C until thawed for use in experiments. The expressed breast milk was aliquoted into FH or unheated (UH) controls. Field conditions were simulated by using a 1-quart aluminum pan from South Africa for a water bath, a 16-ounce glass peanut butter jar to hold breast milk, and single burner butane stove to imitate intense heat of a fire. Briefly, a 50mL sample of breast milk in an uncovered glass peanut butter jar was placed in 450 mL of water in the aluminum pan. The water and milk were heated together over a flame until the water reached 100(C and was at a rolling boil. The breast milk was immediately removed from the water and allowed to cool to 37(C. Viral infectivity was quantitatively measured before and after FH by peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) neutralization assay. HIV-1 neutralization assays employ PBMCs from 4 normal blood donors prepared from buffy coats, pooled and frozen. The cells are stimulated for 72 hours with phytohemagglutinin P (PHA-P). FH and UH milk were diluted 10-fold and transferred to the 96well assay plate in quadruplicate. 2.5 3 10 PBMC per well was added, and the plates were then incubated for 72 hours. Residual cell-free virus was removed by centrifuging and washing the plates and resuspending the cells in 200 mL medium. After an additional incubation of 24 hours, 1% Triton-X detergent was added to each well, and viral p24 quantified by enzyme immunoassay (Zeptometrix). The end point titer for infectivity was determined by the interpolated titer at which there is a 50% inhibition of p24 expression relative to controls. Viral infectivity was also determined by using the TZM-bl assay. This assay employs a cell line (TZM-bl) that is engineered to express CD4 and CCR5 and integrated reporter genes for firefly luciferase and Escherichia coli b-galactosidase under control of an HIV long terminal repeat sequence. TZM-bl cells are permissive to a wide variety of HIV strains and allow the viruses to undergo a single round of replication. Because a latent viral genome cannot be reactivated in a dead cell, we also examined the potential for cellassociated transmission by spiking uninfected PBMCs into breast milk and determining cell viability pre and post FH by flow cytometry. The PBMC assay and detection by p24 antigen is a good way of measuring true infectivity and was able to show a decrease of up to 4.75 logs per mL of virus after FH. However, residual p24 of approximately 2.5 logs remained after FH regardless of the UH titer. This is due to an inherent artifact of the conventional PBMC assay. The conventional PBMC assay involves a rinse step on day 3, which consists of centrifuging and washing the cells in phosphate-buffered saline to remove residual p24 from cell-free inoculum. Because the inoculum used in this experiment was whole cells infected with HIV, this wash step is not able to remove inactivated virus in pelleted cells. The subsequent modified PBMC assay demonstrated this effect, in that new infectious virus did not replicate in the course of that 4-day assay, thus indicating that the residual viral particles are noninfectious. The TZM-bl assay was performed to further support that residual inoculum was noninfectious. This assay has a greater dynamic range than the PBMC/p24 assay due to not having the limitation of detecting defective virions and viral antigens in residual inoculum. This assay showed a complete loss of infectivity after FH. Flow cytometry measurements after FH demonstrated that 99.7% of the cells were dead.",2010,
Full-genomic Network Inference for Non-model organisms: A Case Study for the Fungal Pathogen Candida albicans,"Reverse engineering of full-genomic interaction net- works based on compendia of expression data has been successfully applied for a number of model organisms. This study adapts these approaches for an important non-model organism: The major human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. During the infection process, the pathogen can adapt to a wide range of environmental niches and reversibly changes its growth form. Given the importance of these processes, it is important to know how they are regulated. This study presents a reverse engineering strategy able to infer full- genomic interaction networks for C. albicans based on a linear regression, utilizing the sparseness criterion (LASSO). To overcome the limited amount of expression data and small number of known interactions, we utilize different prior-knowledge sources guiding the network inference to a knowledge driven solution. Since, no database of known interactions for C. albicans exists, we use a text- mining system which utilizes full-text research papers to identify known regulatory interactions. By comparing with these known regulatory interactions, we find an optimal value for global modelling parameters weighting the influence of the sparseness criterion and the prior-knowledge. Furthermore, we show that soft integration of prior-knowledge additionally improves the performance. Finally, we compare the performance of our approach to state of the art network inference approaches.",2011,"World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, International Journal of Biological, Biomolecular, Agricultural, Food and Biotechnological Engineering"
"Celyphus rallus Batten en depocentros del CretÃ¡cico temprano, flanco norte de la Cuenca de San Jorge: significado estratigrÃ¡fico y oleogenÃ©tico","The filamentous cyanobacteria Celyphus rallus (rivulariacean?) is reported from samples of D-129 well, type locality of D-129 Formation (interval 3059-3570 m), the main source rock of the basin. Palynologic assemblages suggest a Hauterivian to Barremian age for that section. However, based on greater changes in frequencies and minor ones in composition, two different associations could be identified. The Lower Association (3335-3570 m) dominated by C. rallus with subordinate Cyclusphaera psilata Volkheimer & Sepulveda, Balmeiopsis limbatus (Balme) Archangelsky, Classopollis spp., Foraminisporis wonthaggiensis (Cookson & Dettmann) Dettmann and F. variornatus Archangelsky has probably developed in the Hauterivian. The high percentages of C. rallus allowed to correlate this interval with those of the Las Heras Group (""Neocomian"") of the Western Flank of the basin. The Upper Association (3059-3320 m), with scarse C. rallus , relatively abundant Classopollis spp., C. psilata and B. limbatus is more probably Barremian in age and surely belongs to the D-129 Formation. Thus, the section which includes the palynologic Lower Association in the D-129 well, previously referred to the D-129 Formation, should be reassigned to the Las Heras Group. These deposits correspond to syntectonic fill of extensional half-grabens developed during the late rift stage of the basin. C. rallus is the dominant palynomorph in organic rich lacustrine mudstones. This facies was considered as a secondary source rock in the western flank of the basin. Recent findings extend their hydrocarbon generation capability to the eastern flank as well, raising the exploratory potential particularly in marginal areas where the D-129 Formation has low-quality organic facies or does not attain oil window maturities.",2003,Revista del Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales
Selection of Variables in Quantile Regression (Linear Lasso- Goal Programming),"Quantile regression is a statistical technique intended to estimate, and conduct inference about the conditional quantile functions. Since Koenker and Bassett (1978) introduced quantile regression, which models conditional quantiles as functions of predictors. The quantile regression can give complete information about the relationship between the response variable and covariates on the entire conditional distribution, and has no distributional assumption about the error term in the model. The study evaluates the performance of three methods; two methods of linear programming linear lasso ( 12L1""> -Lasso, 12L2""> -Lasso) and one method of Goal programming. The three methods are used to select the best subset of variables and estimate the parameters of the quantile regression equation when four error distributions, with two different sample sizes and two different parameters for each error distribution. The study found that the estimated risk and relative estimated risk which produced from Goal programming method is less than ER and ERE of ( 12L1""> -Lasso and 12L2""> -Lasso methods.",2014,Asian Journal of Applied Sciences

Stratigraphic position of these rocks was defined on the basis of relatively complete palynostratigraphic scheme established for western Poland. An assemblage corresponding to the Corollina meyeriana assemblage, more precisely its subassemblage ""b"" in the above palynological scheme, has been found in the boreholes 5 G, 27 G, 40 G, 41 G, and 46 G. The assemblage comprises its nominal species and the taxa Corollina zwolinskai Lund, Classopollis classoides (Pflug) Pocock et Jansonius, Granuloperculatipollis rudis Venkatachala et Goczan, Enzonalasporites vigens Leschik, and others (Table 1), being characteristic of upper part of the Jarkow Beds and lower part of the ZbÄ…szynek Beds. It appears similar to microflora of the Steinmergelkeuper cf the G.D.R. (E. Schulz, 1967) and the Corollina Enzonalasporites zone differentiated in both the Postera Schichten of the F.R.G. and Lower ""Rhaetic"" of Denmark by J. Lund (1977). K.R. Pedersen and J. Lund dated that zone at the Norian. In the borehole column 39 G there was differentiated the Ricciisporites tuberculatus assemblage with the species Rhaetipollites germanicus Schulz, Limbosporites Iundbladii Nilsson, Cyathidites australis Couper, and others (Table 1). It characterizes microflora of lower part of the Wielichowo Beds, which displays some features in common with those of the Middle and Upper ""Rhaetic"" of the G.D.R. (E. Schulz, 1967), the Rhaetipollis Limbosporifes (Middle ""Rhaetic"") and Ricciisporites Polypodiisporites (Upper ""Rhaetic"") of the F.R.G. and Denmark (J. Lund. 1977). Despite of differences in views on ranges of the Norian and Rhaetian stages it may be assumed that age of this microflora corresponds to the Rhaetian in the standard subdivision. At depths 233.0-247.0 m in the borehole column 46 G there was found megaspore assemblage comprising Trileites pinguis (Harris) Potonie, Bacutriletes tylotus (Harris) Potonie and other taxa. In the literature (T.M. Harris, 1935; W. Jung, 1960; H.J. Will, 1969; F. Bertelsen, O. Michelsen. 1970; T. Marcinkiewicz, 1971) the taxa were usually reported from the Upper ""Rhaetic"" or, sometimes, lower parts of ""Rhaetic"". The recorded assemblage also comprised some new species: Talchirela granifera sp. n., Striatriletes ramosus sp.n., and others. Taking into account dating of the studied borehole interval on the basis of miospores it is assumed that stratigraphic range of the above mentioned megaspore assemblage comprises strata of upper parts of the Jarkow Beds and lower part of the ZbÄ…szynek Beds. Description of the megaspores Talchirella granifera sp.n. (Table IV, Fig. 3) Holotypus: Table IV, Fig. 3. L o c u s t y p i c u s: Gostyn area, borehole 46 G, depth 246.0-247.0 m. S t rat u m t y p i cum: Jarkow - ZbÄ…szynek Beds (â€žRhaetic""). De r i vat io n o m i n is: From Lat. granifera - grain-bearing. M ate r i a I: Eight specimens. D e s c r i p t I o n. Megaspores subcircular in outline and 340 -600 Î¼m in diameter. Triradiate rays in the form of low ridges, attaining 0.8 of length of spore radius. Arcuate ridges missing. Whole surface of spores uniformly covered with fine verrucae. Verrucae locally merging with one another to form elongate and flat elements of ornamentation, being also marked on ridges of the tetrad mark. Spore surface somewhat shining, yellow-brownish in colour. R e m a r k s. The species T. granifera sp.n. appears very similar to Pusulosporites permotriassicus Fugl. in style of ornamentation of exine (closely spaced verrucae). However, comparison of representatives of the former and those of P. permotriassicus figured by R. Fuglewicz (1977, table 29 and Figs. 1, 2) shows marked differences in ornamentation of spore surface and development of tetrad mark. T. granifera sp.n. also resembles Talchirella daciae Antonescu et Taugourdeau Lantz from the Middle Buntsandstein of Poland. G.D.R., and Romania (E. Antonescu, J. Taugourdeau Lantz. 1973). differing markedly in character of elements of ornamentation. O c cur r e n c e. Fore-Sudetic Monocline: upper part of the Jarkow Beds and lower part of the ZbÄ…szynek Beds.

Megaspore subcircular-triangular in outline, 300 -500 Î¼m in diameter. Triradiate rays with ridges with wavy margin and 40-60 Î¼m (or sometimes up to 100 Î¼m) in height. Contact areas generally indistinguishable. Arcuate ridges missing. Whole surface of spores ornamented with winding ridges with rounded crest line, 25-40 Î¼m high and 20-25 Î¼m thick; ridges tending to form reticle with large, elongate meshes in distal part to run more or less radially towards apex at proximal surface, where they disappear. In the latter area small projections appear on some specimen. Spore surface shining, brownish in colour. R e m a r k s. The new species resembles Cretaceous Striatriletes radialis (Gunther, Hills) Sweet (P.R. Gunther, L.V. Hills, 1972; A.R. Sweet, 1979), differing in somewhat larger size and more massive ridges at surface. There was found a single tetrade of spores Striatriletes ramosus sp.n. O c c u r r e n c e.
