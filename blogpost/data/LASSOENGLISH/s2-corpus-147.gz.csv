Fractal dimension of cerebral white matter: A consistent feature for prediction of the cognitive performance in patients with small vessel disease and mild cognitive impairment,"Patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) frequently show decline in cognitive performance. However, neuroimaging in SVD patients discloses a wide range of brain lesions and alterations so that it is often difficult to understand which of these changes are the most relevant for cognitive decline. It has also become evident that visually-rated alterations do not fully explain the neuroimaging correlates of cognitive decline in SVD. Fractal dimension (FD), a unitless feature of structural complexity that can be computed from high-resolution T1-weighted images, has been recently applied to the neuroimaging evaluation of the human brain. Indeed, white matter (WM) and cortical gray matter (GM) exhibit an inherent structural complexity that can be measured through the FD. In our study, we included 64 patients (mean ageâ€¯Â±â€¯standard deviation, 74.6â€¯Â±â€¯6.9, education 7.9â€¯Â±â€¯4.2â€¯years, 53% males) with SVD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a control group of 24 healthy subjects (mean ageâ€¯Â±â€¯standard deviation, 72.3â€¯Â±â€¯4.4â€¯years, 50% males). With the aim of assessing whether the FD values of cerebral WM (WM FD) and cortical GM (GM FD) could be valuable structural predictors of cognitive performance in patients with SVD and MCI, we employed a machine learning strategy based on LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression applied on a set of standard and advanced neuroimaging features in a nested cross-validation (CV) loop. This approach was aimed at 1) choosing the best predictive models, able to reliably predict the individual neuropsychological scores sensitive to attention and executive dysfunctions (prominent features of subcortical vascular cognitive impairment) and 2) identifying a features ranking according to their importance in the model through the assessment of the out-of-sample error. For each neuropsychological test, using 1000 repetitions of LASSO regression and 5000 random permutations, we found that the statistically significant models were those for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (p-valueâ€¯=â€¯.039), Symbol Digit Modalities Test scores (p-valueâ€¯=â€¯.039), and Trail Making Test Part A scores (p-valueâ€¯=â€¯.025). Significant prediction of these scores was obtained using different sets of neuroimaging features in which the WM FD was the most frequently selected feature. In conclusion, we showed that a machine learning approach could be useful in SVD research field using standard and advanced neuroimaging features. Our study results raise the possibility that FD may represent a consistent feature in predicting cognitive decline in SVD that can complement standard imaging.",2019,NeuroImage : Clinical
New Bayesian Lasso Composite Quantile Regression,"In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian lasso inference scheme for variable selection in composite quantile regression model (C Quantile Reg). The suggested approach is to construct a hierarchical structure within the Gibbs sampling under the assumption that the residual term comes from skew Laplace distribution (asymmetric Laplace distribution) andÂ  assign scale mixture uniform (SMU) as prior distributions on the coefficients of composite quantile regression model. Our proposed method was compared to some other existing methods by testing the performance of these methods through simulation studies and real data examples.",2017,"American Scientific Research Journal for Engineering, Technology, and Sciences"
Mineral water from spring Px-6 â€“ physico-chemical characteristics and indications for use,"The aim of the article is to present full physiochemical analyses of the mineral water from spring Px-6 which is used for the treament of patients in the Clinic of Thalassotherapy, Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation at Saints Constantine and Helena resort, the indications for use of that water and the main benefits that may occur after treatment. Full physico-chemical analyses show significant stability in the composition of the components. Combining physical exercises, electrotherapy, hot packs with lye or other kind of physical factors with balneotherapy is highly effective for the treatment of different disorders. The use of water for prophylaxis, wellness and recreation in healthy people is not excluded. Contraindications are limited. Though the positive effect of water from spring Px-6 is proven concerning its physico-chemical characteristics and our own experience, more scientific researches should be conducted to increase the evidence of the benefits of this water and its further optimal use for prophylaxis, treatment and wellness.",2018,
APPLE: approximate path for penalized likelihood estimators,"In high-dimensional data analysis, penalized likelihood estimators are shown to provide superior results in both variable selection and parameter estimation. A new algorithm, APPLE, is proposed for calculating the Approximate Path for Penalized Likelihood Estimators. Both convex penalties (such as LASSO) and folded concave penalties (such as MCP) are considered. APPLE efficiently computes the solution path for the penalized likelihood estimator using a hybrid of the modified predictor-corrector method and the coordinate-descent algorithm. APPLE is compared with several well-known packages via simulation and analysis of two gene expression data sets.",2014,Statistics and Computing
On the interest of a space-time regularization for reconstructing sparse excitation sources,"In time domain, force reconstruction problems are commonly solved from Tikhonov and LASSO regularizations. Practically, these approaches can lead to inaccurate reconstructions, if the sources to identify don't share the same space-time characteristics or the corresponding force vector doesn't exhibit the desired structure. To alleviate this potential drawback, we have recently introduced a multiplicative space-time regularization that allows exploiting one's prior knowledge of the spatial distribution of the sources as well as their time history. In this contribution, the proposed regularization strategy is compared to the multiplicative Tikhonov and LASSO regularizations through an experimental application to point out the practical interest of exploiting simultaneously both spatial and temporal prior information in terms of quality and robustness of the reconstructed excitation sources. 1. Introduction Force reconstruction problems in time domain still remain an active topic in the structural dynamics community. To solve this problem, several approaches have been developed, such as Kalman filtering [1] or adaptive filtering [2]. However, the most widespread strategy is certainly the regularization, and more particularly, the Tikhonov and LASSO regularizations. From a theoretical standpoint, Tikhonov regularization should be used when the force signal exhibits a certain continuity [3, 4] and the spatial distribution of the sources is rather smooth [5]. On the contrary, LASSO regularization should be used when the excitation signal is rather impulsive [6, 7] and the spatial distribution of the sources is sparse [8]. It results that classical strategies developed in the literature are theoretically not always well adapted to tackle both the local-ization and time reconstruction problems at the same time, except for configurations where the force vector to identify has the desired structure or the spatial distribution of sources and the nature of the excitation signals share the same space-time characteristics, such as the sparsity [9]. To the best of our knowledge, only a few methods have been developed to address this specific issue and they generally consist in solving the space-time reconstruction problem in a separated manner [10].",2019,
Estimating the Penalty Level of $\ell_{1}$-minimization via Two Gaussian Approximation Methods,"In this paper, we aim to give a theoretical approximation for the penalty level of $\ell_{1}$-regularization problems. This can save much time in practice compared with the traditional methods, such as cross-validation. To achieve this goal, we develop two Gaussian approximation methods, which are based on a moderate deviation theorem and Stein's method respectively. Both of them give efficient approximations and have good performances in simulations. We apply the two Gaussian approximation methods into three types of ultra-high dimensional $\ell_{1}$ penalized regressions: lasso, square-root lasso, and weighted $\ell_{1}$ penalized Poisson regression. The numerical results indicate that our two ways to estimate the penalty levels achieve high computational efficiency. Besides, our prediction errors outperform that based on the 10-fold cross-validation.",2020,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Proactive advising: a machine learning driven approach to vaccine hesitancy,"Despite once being nearly eradicated, Measles cases in Europe have surged to a 20-year high with more than 60,000 cases in 2018, due to a dramatic decrease in vaccination rates. The decrease in Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccination rates can be attributed to an increase in â€˜vaccine hesitancyâ€™, or the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite their availability. Vaccine hesitancy is a relatively new global problem for which effective interventions are not yet established. In this paper, a novel machine learning approach to identify children at risk of not being vaccinated against MMR is proposed, with the objective of facilitating proactive action by healthcare workers and policymakers. A use case of the approach is the provision of individualized informative guidance to families that may otherwise become or are already vaccine hesitant. Using a LASSO logistic regression model trained on 44,000 child Electronic Health Records (EHRs), vaccine hesitant families can be identified with a higher precision (0.72) than predicting vaccine uptake based on a childâ€™s infant vaccination record alone (0.63). The model uses a low number of attributes of the child and his or her family and community to produce a prediction, making it readily interpretable by healthcare professionals. The implementation of the machine learning model into an open source dashboard for use by healthcare providers and policymakers as an Early Warning and Monitoring System (EWS) against vaccine hesitancy is proposed. The EWS would facilitate a wide variety of proactive, anticipatory and therefore potentially more effective public health interventions, compared to reactive interventions taken after vaccine rejections.",2019,2019 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)
Interactive Object Retrieval using Interpretable Visual Models,"This thesis is an attempt to improve visual object retrieval by allowing users to interact with the system. Our solution lies in constructing an interactive system that allows users to define their own visual concept from a concise set of visual patches given as input. These patches, which represent the most informative clues of a given visual category, are trained beforehand with a supervised learning algorithm in a discriminative manner. Then, and in order to specialize their models, users have the possibility to send their feedback on the model itself by choosing and weighting the patches they are confident of. The real challenge consists in how to generate concise and visually interpretable models. Our contribution relies on two points. First, in contrast to the state-of-the-art approaches that use bag-of-words, we propose embedding local visual features without any quantization, which means that each component of the high-dimensional feature vectors used to describe an image is associated to a unique and precisely localized image patch. Second, we suggest using regularization constraints in the loss function of our classifier to favor sparsity in the models produced. Sparsity is indeed preferable for concision (a reduced number of patches in the model) as well as for decreasing prediction time. To meet these objectives, we developed a multiple-instance learning scheme using a modified version of the BLasso algorithm. BLasso is a boosting-like procedure that behaves in the same way as Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator). It efficiently regularizes the loss function with an additive L1-constraint by alternating between forward and backward steps at each iteration. The method we propose here is generic in the sense that it can be used with any local features or feature sets representing the content of an image region.",2011,
Genome-Wide Association Mapping and Genomic Selection for Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) Forage Quality Traits,"Genetic progress for forage quality has been poor in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), the most-grown forage legume worldwide. This study aimed at exploring opportunities for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genomic selection of forage quality traits based on breeding values of parent plants. Some 154 genotypes from a broadly-based reference population were genotyped by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), and phenotyped for leaf-to-stem ratio, leaf and stem contents of protein, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL), and leaf and stem NDF digestibility after 24 hours (NDFD), of their dense-planted half-sib progenies in three growing conditions (summer harvest, full irrigation; summer harvest, suspended irrigation; autumn harvest). Trait-marker analyses were performed on progeny values averaged over conditions, owing to modest germplasm Ã— condition interaction. Genomic selection exploited 11,450 polymorphic SNP markers, whereas a subset of 8,494 M. truncatula-aligned markers were used for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). GWAS confirmed the polygenic control of quality traits and, in agreement with phenotypic correlations, indicated substantially different genetic control of a given trait in stems and leaves. It detected several SNPs in different annotated genes that were highly linked to stem protein content. Also, it identified a small genomic region on chromosome 8 with high concentration of annotated genes associated with leaf ADL, including one gene probably involved in the lignin pathway. Three genomic selection models, i.e., Ridge-regression BLUP, Bayes B and Bayesian Lasso, displayed similar prediction accuracy, whereas SVR-lin was less accurate. Accuracy values were moderate (0.3-0.4) for stem NDFD and leaf protein content, modest for leaf ADL and NDFD, and low to very low for the other traits. Along with previous results for the same germplasm set, this study indicates that GBS data can be exploited to improve both quality traits (by genomic selection or MAS) and forage yield.",2017,PLoS ONE
Estimating stellar atmospheric parameters based on LASSO and support-vector regression,"A scheme for estimating atmospheric parameters T$_{eff}$, log$~g$, and [Fe/H] is proposed on the basis of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm and Haar wavelet. The proposed scheme consists of three processes. A spectrum is decomposed using the Haar wavelet transform and low-frequency components at the fourth level are considered as candidate features. Then, spectral features from the candidate features are detected using the LASSO algorithm to estimate the atmospheric parameters. Finally, atmospheric parameters are estimated from the extracted spectral features using the support-vector regression (SVR) method. The proposed scheme was evaluated using three sets of stellar spectra respectively from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), and Kurucz's model, respectively. The mean absolute errors are as follows: for 40~000 SDSS spectra, 0.0062 dex for log~T$_{eff}$ (85.83 K for T$_{eff}$), 0.2035 dex for log$~g$ and 0.1512 dex for [Fe/H]; for 23963 LAMOST spectra, 0.0074 dex for log~T$_{eff}$ (95.37 K for T$_{eff}$), 0.1528 dex for log~$g$, and 0.1146 dex for [Fe/H]; and for 10469 synthetic spectra, 0.0010 dex for log T$_{eff}$(14.42K for T$_{eff}$), 0.0123 dex for log~$g$, and 0.0125 dex for [Fe/H].",2015,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
Quantile Regression with Elastic-net in Statistical Downscaling to Predict Extreme Rainfall Tri,"Rainfall prediction is necessary since extreme rainfall has a big impact to the environment. A method commonly used to predict rainfall is statistical downscaling. This technique develops a functional relation between local scale rainfall data and global scale General Circulation Model (GCM) output data. The multicollinearity problem in GCM output data can be overcome by the elastic-net regularization which is the combination of ridge and lasso regularizations. The elastic-net is better than only lasso or ridge regularization especially if among predictors are highly correlated. Quantile regression can be used to predict the extreme rainfall. This paper discusses quantile regression in statistical downscaling with elastic-net regularization to predict extreme rainfall. The results show that the extreme rainfall which occur in January and December 2013 was predicted properly at Q(0.75) and Q(0.90) respectively, and elastic-net penalized quantile regression model was consistent.

"The Geometry of Uniqueness and Model Selection of Penalized Estimators including SLOPE, LASSO, and Basis Pursuit","We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of penalized least-squares estimators with a penalty term consisting a norm whose unit ball is given by a polytope. The condition is given by a geometric criterion involving how the row span of the design matrix intersects the faces of the dual norm unit cube. This criterion also provides information about the model selection properties of the corresponding estimation method. Our analyses cover LASSO, the related method of basis pursuit, as well as the SLOPE estimator.",2020,
Learning low dimensional word based linear classifiers using Data Shared Adaptive Bootstrap Aggregated Lasso with application to IMDb data,"In this article we propose a new supervised ensemble learning method called Data Shared Adaptive Bootstrap Aggregated (AdaBag) Lasso for capturing low dimensional useful features for word based sentiment analysis and mining problems. The literature on ensemble methods is very rich in both statistics and machine learning. The algorithm is a substantial upgrade of the Data Shared Lasso uplift algorithm. The most significant conceptual addition to the existing literature lies in the final selection of bag of predictors through a special bootstrap aggregation scheme. We apply the algorithm to one simulated data and perform dimension reduction in grouped IMDb data (drama, comedy and horror) to extract reduced set of word features for predicting sentiment ratings of movie reviews demonstrating different aspects. We also compare the performance of the present method with the classical Principal Components with associated Linear Discrimination (PCA-LD) as baseline. There are few limitations in the algorithm. Firstly, the algorithm workflow does not incorporate online sequential data acquisition and it does not use sentence based models which are common in ANN algorithms . Our results produce slightly higher error rate compare to the reported state-of-the-art as a consequence.",2018,ArXiv
To Value the Efficiency of Pyronaridine-artesunate and Artemether-lumefantrine in the Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria of Plasmodium Spp. in Burkina Faso,"Background No safe and highly effective malaria vaccine is available today. The treatment drugs currently in use remain insufficient. Moreover, resistance to these drugs makes malaria control difficult. The development of new therapeutic drugs is required. This abstract is part of a survey from the WANECAM study entitled â€˜Randomised trial to assess the effect of repeated treatment of pyronaridine-artesunate (PA), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in patients presenting uncomplicated malaria in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Fasoâ€™. We present here the analysis of the first episodes on the therapeutic efficiency of PA compared to AL, which is the first-line antimarial used in Burkina Faso. Methods A total of 448 subjects were randomised to receive treatment (224 subjects in each arm). Malaria diagnosis was assessed by microscopy. Subjects were follow-up during 42 days. Treatment response was measured according to standard of care as per WHO guidelines of 2003. The correction of the cases of treatment failure by molecular biology techniques is under analysis. Results On Day 28, the therapeutic failures were 3.35% in the PA group as against 18,10% for the AL group. On Day 42, a significant increase of the treatment failures in every group is observed with a higher rate in the AL group (31.43%), against 17.22% in the PA group. Conclusions This survey shows that less cases of treatment failure occurred in the patients9 group treated with PA compared to the group treated with AL. These findings contributed to evidence base for a change in malaria treatment policy guidelines for uncomplicated malaria in Burkina Faso.",2017,BMJ Global Health
Feature grouping and selection over an undirected graph,"High-dimensional regression/classification continues to be an important and challenging problem, especially when features are highly correlated. Feature selection, combined with additional structure information on the features has been considered to be promising in promoting regression/classification performance. Graph-guided fused lasso (GFlasso) has recently been proposed to facilitate feature selection and graph structure exploitation, when features exhibit certain graph structures. However, the formulation in GFlasso relies on pairwise sample correlations to perform feature grouping, which could introduce additional estimation bias. In this paper, we propose three new feature grouping and selection methods to resolve this issue. The first method employs a convex function to penalize the pairwise lâˆž norm of connected regression/classification coefficients, achieving simultaneous feature grouping and selection. The second method improves the first one by utilizing a non-convex function to reduce the estimation bias. The third one is the extension of the second method using a truncated l1 regularization to further reduce the estimation bias. The proposed methods combine feature grouping and feature selection to enhance estimation accuracy. We employ the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and difference of convex functions (DC) programming to solve the proposed formulations. Our experimental results on synthetic data and two real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",2012,KDD : proceedings.

"Glasson UID, Cumbria. Archaeological Watching Brief and Evaluation.","In 2004, United Utilities submitted a planning application to upgrade current sewer works at Glasson, Cumbria (centred on NY 2556 6025). This development involves the insertion of a new chamber within the scheduled area of the Vallum associated with Hadrianâ€™s Wall (SM 26122), and a new overflow pipe adjacent to the same scheduled area. Hadrianâ€™s Wall is a site of international importance, and as such is 
designated a World Heritage Site. The Hadrianâ€™s Walls Archaeologist of English Heritage therefore recommended a programme of archaeological investigations prior to and during the development. This report sets out the results of the investigations, comprising an archaeological watching brief on three test pits along the pipeline 
easement, four evaluation trenches along the pipe route outside of the scheduled area and a single trench within the scheduled area. 
The watching brief on the test pits, excavated by the client for geotechnical purposes in July 2004, and the four archaeological evaluation trenches (excavated in September 2004) located outside the scheduled area were excavated down to the natural till. Although a number of field drains were located, no deposits of any archaeological significance were present. It was not recommended that any further 
archaeological excavation be conducted outside the scheduled area, although an archaeological watching brief on the development should be maintained as stipulated in the project design for this work (Appendix 1).",2005,

AB1380 The impact of osteoarthritis on the functioning of individuals: A statistical validation of the brief ICF core set for osteoarthritis based on a large international sample of patients with osteoarthritis,"Background The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 1 is a reference framework to describe the impact of health conditions on functioning and disability. A Comprehensive and Brief ICF Core Set for osteoarthritis (OA) has been developed 2 and must be statistically validated. Objectives Our specific aims were (1) to identify ICF categories that best explain patientsâ€™ functioning, (2) to determine the content validity of the Brief ICF Core Set, and (3) to propose a statistically-validated version. Methods Psychometric study using Group Lasso regression on data from a convenience sample of 879 OA patients from 20 countries. The subscale on general health of the SF-36 was used as dependent variable and all ICF categories of the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for OA and some socio-demographics and disease-specific characteristics as independent variables. The most relevant ICF categories were identified as those showing a significant effect based on the pointwise 90% confidence intervals resulting from 1000 bootstrap trials. Results Based on our results, there were 15 ICF categories included in the statistically-validated version of the Brief ICF Core Set for OA: five body functions (sensation of pain, mobility of joint, muscle power, energy and drive, and emotional functions), three body structures (structure of upper extremity, structure of lower extremity, and additional musculoskeletal structures related to movement), three activities and participation (hand and arm use, walking, and dressing), and four environmental factors (products and technology for personal use in daily living, immediate family, health services, systems and policies, and societal attitudes). Twelve of the original 13 Brief ICF Core Set categories were confirmed, and three additional ICF categories were identified. Conclusions Our findings reassure the validity of the Brief ICF Core Set for OA. The statistically validated Core Set (12 categories out of 13) with the additional three statistically-derived ICF categories will likely perform better with regard to discrimination and sensitivity to change in studies and trials, and should be further explored in the future.

A combination of variable selection and data mining techniques for high-dimensional statistical modelling,"Variable selection is fundamental to statistical modelling in diverse fields of sciences. This paper deals with the problem of high-dimensional statistical modelling through the analysis of seismological data in Greece acquired during the years 1962-2003. The dataset consists of 10,333 observations and 11 factors, used to detect possible risk factors of large earthquakes. In our study, different statistical variable selection techniques are applied, while data mining techniques enable us to discover associations, meaningful patterns and rules. The statistical methods employed in this work were the non-concave penalised likelihood methods, SCAD, LASSO and Hard, the generalised linear logistic regression and the best subset variable selection. The applied data mining methods were three decision trees algorithms, the classification and regression tree (C%RT), the chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) and the C5.0 algorithm.

Learning an Eddy Viscosity Model with Shrinkage- A Case Study with Jet-in-Crossflow Configuration,"We demonstrate a statistical method for learning a high-order eddy viscosity model from experimental data and using it to improve the predictive skill of a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulator. The method is tested in a supersonic-jet-in-transoniccrossflow configuration. The process starts with a cubic eddy viscosity model (CEVM), calibrated for incompressible flows. It is fitted to measurements of turbulent stresses from a compressible flow experiment using shrinkage regression, specifically LASSO. LASSO retains the terms in the CEVM that are strongly supported by the data i.e., the most important terms, while removing the rest. For our particular case, LASSO removes all the terms except one that is quadratic in vorticity. The second step involves calibrating three parameters of the RANS model (one being the coefficient of the vorticity term in the truncated CEVM) using measurements of mean flow from a jet-in-crossflow experiment. The predictions of the calibrated RANS model with (truncated) CEVM is compared with experimental data as well as a calibrated RANS model using a linear eddy viscosity model (LEVM). Preliminary results show that high-order eddy viscosity model provides better predictions of turbulent stresses vis-a-vis RANS simulations with LEVM.",2015,
State-dependent parental care in the Antarctic petrel: responses to manipulated chick age during early chick rearing,"Life histories are state-dependent, and an individualâ€™s reproductive decisions are determined by its available resources and the needs of its offspring. Here we test how a chickâ€™s needs for food and protection influence parental decisions in the Antarctic petrel, Thalassoica antarctica , where the parents, due to their long breeding lifespan, are expected to give priority to their own needs before those of the young. We exchanged one-day-old chicks with four-day-old chicks and studied how the parents subsequently provided care to the chick. The duration of the guarding period was adjusted, and parents left older chicks earlier and younger chicks later compared to controls. Three mechanisms were responsible for the adjustments. 1) Parents with an older chick co-ordinated fewer guarding spells whereas parents with a younger chick co-ordinated more guarding spells. 2) At the last guarding spell, i.e. where a parent left the chick alone before the partner returned, less time was spent with older chicks, and more time with younger chicks. 3) Foraging trip duration was shortened by parents given older chicks and prolonged by parents given younger chicks, probably in response to the chickâ€™s food demand. Hence, the parents responded quickly to the altered needs of the chick. Parents with high body mass guarded longer and were better able to coordinate the guarding spells compared to lighter parents. In conclusion, Antarctic petrels adjust reproductive decisions to their own, their mateâ€™s, and their chickâ€™s state, and they seem to respond to the chickâ€™s needs for both food and protection.",2004,Oikos
Filter shaping for Convolutional Neural Networks,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for classification of visual inputs. An important property of CNN is its restriction to local connections and sharing of local weights among different locations. In this paper, we consider the definition of appropriate local neighborhoods in CNN. We provide a theoretical analysis that justifies the traditional square filter used in CNN for analyzing natural images. The analysis also provides a principle for designing customized filter shapes for application domains that do not resemble natural images. We propose an approach that automatically designs multiple layers of different customized filter shapes by repeatedly solving lasso problems. It is applied to customize the filter shape for both bioacoustic applications and gene sequence analysis applications. In those domains with small sample sizes we demonstrate that the customized filters achieve superior classification accuracy, improved convergence behavior in training and reduced sensitivity to hyperparameters.",2017,
A Joint Optimization Model for Image Summarization Based on Image Content and Tags,"As an effective technology for navigating a large number of images, image summarization is becoming a promising task with the rapid development of image sharing sites and social networks. Most existing summarization approaches use the visual-based features for image representation without considering tag information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named JOINT, which employs both image content and tag information to summarize images. Our model generates the summary images which can best reconstruct the original collection. Based on the assumption that an image with representative content should also have typical tags, we introduce a similarity-inducing regularizer to our model. Furthermore, we impose the lasso penalty on the objective function to yield a concise summary set. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model out-performs the state-of-the-art approaches.",2014,
Development of an Immune-Related Prognostic Signature in Breast Cancer,"Background Although increased early detection, diagnosis and treatment have improved the outcome of breast cancer patients, prognosis estimation still poses challenges due to the disease heterogeneity. Accumulating data indicated an evident correlation between tumor immune microenvironment and clinical outcomes. Objective To construct an immune-related signature that can estimate disease prognosis and patient survival in breast cancer. Methods Gene expression profiles and clinical data of breast cancer patients were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, which were further divided into a training set (n = 499), a testing set (n = 234) and a Meta-validation set (n = 519). In the training set, immune-related genes were recognized using combination of gene expression data and ESTIMATE algorithm-derived immune scores. An immune-related prognostic signature was generated with LASSO Cox regression analysis. The prognostic value of the signature was validated in the testing set and the Meta-validation set. Results A total of 991 immune-related genes were identified. Twelve genes with non-zero coefficients in LASSO analysis were used to construct an immune-related prognostic signature. The 12-gene signature significantly stratified patients into high and low immune risk groups in terms of overall survival independent of clinical and pathologic factors. The signature also significantly stratified overall survival in clinical defined groups, including stage I/II disease. Several biological processes, such as immune response, were enriched among genes in the immune-related signature. The percentage of M2 macrophage infiltration was significantly different between low and high immune risk groups. Time-dependent ROC curves indicated good performance of our signature in predicting the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival for patients from the full TCGA cohort. Furthermore, the composite signature derived by integrating immune-related signature with clinical factors, provided a more accurate estimation of survival relative to molecular signature alone. Conclusion We developed a 12-gene prognostic signature, providing novel insights into the identification of breast cancer with a high risk of death and assessment of the possibility of immunotherapy incorporation in personalized breast cancer management.",2019,Frontiers in Genetics
DALASS: Variable selection in discriminant analysis via the LASSO,The objective of DALASS is to simplify the interpretation of Fisher's discriminant function coefficients. The DALASS problem-discriminant analysis (DA) modified so that the canonical variates satisfy the LASSO constraint-is formulated as a dynamical system on the unit sphere. Both standard and orthogonal canonical variates are considered. The globally convergent continuous-time algorithms are illustrated numerically and applied to some well-known data sets.,2007,Comput.

The GAIF-Positive Population of Neurons in the Evolution of the Temnocephalida,"The nervous system of three species of the Temnocephalida has been studied using the GAIF method (which in small flatworms mostly reveals sensory catecholaminergic neurons). These species represent the evolution from the primitive â€œturbellarian-likeâ€ temnocephalids to the most specialised ones with tentacles and a sucker. The numbers and positions of GAIF-positive neurons are invariant within each species and do not change from hatching to full maturity. A characteristic unpaired neuron contributing to the innervation of the anterior margin of the body is present in all species: such a cell has previously been found only in marine Thalassovortex tyrrhenicus (Dalyellidae) which confirms close relationships between these taxa. Our series of species shows (i) a reduction in number of GAIF-positive perikarya associated with the lateral cords and reduction of GAIF-positive innervation on the ventral side of the body, which is probably related to the loss of ciliary locomotion (the shift to passive hunting and looping locomotion) and (ii) reinforcement of the GAIF-positive innervation of the anterior end of the body which begins to play an important role in capturing the prey. The retention of the medial unpaired neuron and nearly identical sets of GAIF-positive neurons in Diceratocephala boschmai and Craspedella pedum (rather different in morphology) give the first indication (in the Plathelminthes) of persistence of homologous neurons through significant evolutionary transformations of the organs they innervate.",1998,Acta Zoologica
Balancing Statistical and Computational Precision and Applications to Penalized Linear Regression with Group Sparsity.,"Due to technological advances, large and high-dimensional data have become the rule rather than the exception. Methods that allow for feature selection with such data are thus highly sought after, in particular, since standard methods, such as cross-validated lasso and group-lasso, can be challenging both computationally and mathematically. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to feature selection and group feature selection in linear regression. It consists of simple optimization steps and tests, which makes it computationally more efficient than standard approaches and suitable even for very large data sets. Moreover, it satisfies sharp guarantees for estimation and feature selection in terms of oracle inequalities. We thus expect that our contribution can help to leverage the increasing volume of data in Biology, Public Health, Astronomy, Economics, and other fields.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Computing Estimators of Dantzig Selector type via Column and Constraint Generation,"We consider a class of linear-programming based estimators in reconstructing a sparse signal from linear measurements. Specific formulations of the reconstruction problem considered here include Dantzig selector, basis pursuit (for the case in which the measurements contain no errors), and the fused Dantzig selector (for the case in which the underlying signal is piecewise constant). In spite of being estimators central to sparse signal processing and machine learning, solving these linear programming problems for large scale instances remains a challenging task, thereby limiting their usage in practice. We show that classic constraint- and column-generation techniques from large scale linear programming, when used in conjunction with a commercial implementation of the simplex method, and initialized with the solution from a closely-related Lasso formulation, yields solutions with high efficiency in many settings.",2019,arXiv: Computation
Prognostic value of low-dose dobutamine testing in asymptomatic patients with moderate or severe aortic stenosis and preserved ejection fraction,"Purpose: In Aortic Stenosis (AS) most Doppler-echocardiographic indices that are used for assessing AS severity are flow dependent. The aim of this study was to assess prognostic value of low-dose Dobutamine Testing (DT) in patients with moderate or severe AS and preserved Ejection Fraction (EF).

Method: A total of 126 asymptomatic patients with aortic valve area (AVA) â‰¤1.5 cm2 and EF >50% were enrolled in this prospective study. The follow-up period was 14Â±2 months. Mean age was 66.47Â±10.53; (58.73% males), mean EF was 72,03Â±6,69%, mean pressure gradient (Pmean) 41.94Â±11.22 mmHg and mean AVA 0.82Â±0.22 cm2. Patients with â‰¥2+ valvular regurgitation or more than mild mitral stenosis were excluded. The dobutamine infusion protocol was begun at 5 Î¼g/kg/min body weight up to 20 Î¼g/kg/min, titrated upwards at steps of 5 Î¼g/kg/min every 3 min. The composite outcome endpoint (MACE) was defined as cardiac death, aortic valve replacement and hospitalization caused by AS symptoms according to patient's medical record.

Results: No patient experienced a serious adverse event during or after DT. A total of 70 patients had MACE (55.55%), of which 9 patients (7.14%) have died during follow-up. Out of 70 patients, 56 patients (80%) had an Aortic Valve Replacement (RAV). Patients who had an increase in AVA during DT â‰¤0.2 cm2 and/or final AVA â‰¤1 cm2 had more often RAV (hi=9.5311; df=1; p=0.002). The lasso penalized Cox regression, conducted solely on the variables at rest, showed that the greatest predictive capacity has the aortic valve resistance (AVR). At the same time, the AUC for the all analyzed pre-dobutamine variables combined, evaluated at time = 12 months, was 0.76. On the other hand, the L1 procedure, when applied on all variables (pre and during DT), chooses only dobutamine variables as the most valuable in predictive sense, improving AUC by 6% (AUC =0.82, at time = 12 months). The value of the AVR obtained during the DT was the strongest independent one-year MACE predictor (according to bootstrapped p values) of all pre and during DT varaibles, with the value of 195.12 dynes s cm-5 having the highest sensitivity ans specificity in predicting MACE (0.78 and 0.73 respectively). In addition, patients who have experienced symptoms (11/126, 8.73%) during DT had more often MACE comparing to asymptomatic patients (hi=6,7408; p<0,001; df=1).

Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that AVR, as well as flow-mediated changes during DT, can provide new, clinically relevant information in terms of outcome and timing of valve replacement in asymptomatic patients with moderate and severe AS and preserved EF.",2013,European Heart Journal
A Proximal Point Dual Newton Algorithm for Solving Group Graphical Lasso Problems.,"Undirected graphical models have been especially popular for learning the conditional independence structure among a large number of variables where the observations are drawn independently and identically from the same distribution. However, many modern statistical problems would involve categorical data or time-varying data, which might follow different but related underlying distributions. In order to learn a collection of related graphical models simultaneously, various joint graphical models inducing sparsity in graphs and similarity across graphs have been proposed. In this paper, we aim to propose an implementable proximal point dual Newton algorithm (PPDNA) for solving the group graphical Lasso model, which encourages a shared pattern of sparsity across graphs. Though the group graphical Lasso regularizer is non-polyhedral, the asymptotic superlinear convergence of our proposed method PPDNA can be obtained by leveraging on the local Lipschitz continuity of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution mapping associated with the group graphical Lasso model. A variety of numerical experiments on real data sets illustrates that the PPDNA for solving the group graphical Lasso model can be highly efficient and robust.",2019,arXiv: Optimization and Control
Identifying functional cancer-specific miRNA-mRNA interactions in testicular germ cell tumor.,"Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men aged between 15 and 35 and more than 90% of testicular neoplasms are originated at germ cells. Recent research has shown the impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) in different types of cancer, including testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT). MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs which affect the development and progression of cancer cells by binding to mRNAs and regulating their expressions. The identification of functional miRNA-mRNA interactions in cancers, i.e. those that alter the expression of genes in cancer cells, can help delineate post-regulatory mechanisms and may lead to new treatments to control the progression of cancer. A number of sequence-based methods have been developed to predict miRNA-mRNA interactions based on the complementarity of sequences. While necessary, sequence complementarity is, however, not sufficient for presence of functional interactions. Alternative methods have thus been developed to refine the sequence-based interactions using concurrent expression profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs. This study aims to find functional cancer-specific miRNA-mRNA interactions in TGCT. To this end, the sequence-based predicted interactions are first refined using an ensemble learning method, based on two well-known methods of learning miRNA-mRNA interactions, namely, TaLasso and GenMiR++. Additional functional analyses were then used to identify a subset of interactions to be most likely functional and specific to TGCT. The final list of 13 miRNA-mRNA interactions can be potential targets for identifying TGCT-specific interactions and future laboratory experiments to develop new therapies.",2016,Journal of theoretical biology
Five-Year Trend Analysis of Capacity Utilization Measures in a Teaching Hospital 2008-2012,"Background: Evaluation of hospitals performance determines what hospitals really do, and define deficiencies with regard to the original standards and identify opportunities for improvement. Objectives: We investigated trends in the performance of a hospital with capacity utilization measures used in Pabon Lasso (PL) model. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study from March 2008 to March 2012, we retrieved all performance data from the Hospital Information System of Shahid Faghihi Hospital, a public teaching hospital in Shiraz, Iran. Measurements included changes in the trend of three indices: bed turnover, bed occupancy rate, and average length of stay. Results: The trends in hospital performance showed a decrease in mean (median) hospital stay from 6.77 (Â± 3.11) days in 2008 to 4.25 (Â± 2.70) days in 2012. In 2008, bed turnover was 50.03 times/year, bed occupancy rate was 92.9% and turnover interval was 0.51 days. In 2012, these indices were 60.8 times/year, 70.9%, and 1.74 days, respectively. These measures in PL model showed that Shahid Faghihi Hospital was located in zone 4 during 2008-2009, zone 1 during 2010-2011, and zone 3 during 2012, indicating an acceptable degree of efficiency and an optimal level of performance. Conclusions: This hospital showed relative improvements in all capacity utilization measures in 2012. Future efforts should examine new interventions to further increase the hospitalâ€™s performance capacity.",2015,shiraz e medical journal

Oracle inequalities for ranking and U-processes with Lasso penalty,"We investigate properties of estimators obtained by minimization of U-processes with the Lasso penalty in the high-dimensional setting.

Besides, we study properties of estimators on simulated data sets.",2017,Neurocomputing
Recovering Direct Effects in Genetics: A Comparison,"In genetics it is often of interest to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are directly related to a disease, rather than just being associated with it. Few methods exist, however, addressing this so-called `true sparsity recovery' issue. In a thorough simulation study, we show that for moderate or low correlation between predictors, lasso-based methods perform well at true sparsity recovery, despite not being specifically designed for this purpose. For large correlations, however, more specialised methods are needed. Stability selection and direct effect testing perform well in all situations, including when the correlation is large.",2011,arXiv: Applications
Spa techniques and technologies: from the past to the present,"Thermal waters have been used from ancient times. From those early experiences and the consecutive improvements in the understanding and treatment of these waters, all around the world different cultures and communities have used natural structures or have built facilities for the best use and exploitation of the mineral spring water. Nowadays thermal spas, inheritors of a rich and long tradition from the ancient world, combine classical techniques with innovative proposals. Thus, the introduction and implementation of new technologies in bathtubs, swimming pools, showers, saunas, etc., allow the efficient optimization of thermal techniques and hydrotherapy facilities. Moreover, the development of health tourism offers a new way to understand the use of thermal water, which requires higher quality and specialization of the spa services. Every year thousands of people travel to Europe for a healthy holiday and to improve their welfare and wellbeing. Resorts, spas, thalassotherapy centers and thermal spas that use hot thermal water utilize bath techniques, respiratory applications, pressure techniques, wraps, etc. These techniques use facilities and amenities such as swimming pools, bathtubs, showers, sprays and stoves, among others. One can also find peloids (thermal mud) and any kind of clay and herbal wraps. From the practices developed in Roman times, but especially from the first hydrotherapy techniques described by Priessnitz until today, there have been numerous innovations that have enabled the spas to adapt to the demands and needs of a new type of customer. Nowadays, there are companies specializing in the design and innovation of hydrotherapy that favour the modernization of existing spas or the emergence of new spas. The highlights are control and automation; new materials; design and architecture designed by prestigious architects.",2017,Sustainable Water Resources Management
Hyperspectral-Multispectral Image Fusion with Weighted LASSO,"Spectral imaging enables spatially-resolved identification of materials in remote sensing, biomedicine, and astronomy. However, acquisition times require balancing spectral and spatial resolution with signal-to-noise. Hyperspectral imaging provides superior material specificity, while multispectral images are faster to collect at greater fidelity. We propose an approach for fusing hyperspectral and multispectral images to provide high-quality hyperspectral output. The proposed optimization leverages the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to perform variable selection and regularization. Computational time is reduced by applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), as well as initializing the fusion image by estimating it using maximum a posteriori (MAP) based on Hardie's method. We demonstrate that the proposed sparse fusion and reconstruction provides quantitatively superior results when compared to existing methods on publicly available images. Finally, we show how the proposed method can be practically applied in biomedical infrared spectroscopic microscopy.",2020,ArXiv
Cancer Genetic Network Inference Using Gaussian Graphical Models,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides a rich resource that can be used to understand how genes interact in cancer cells and has collected RNA-Seq gene expression data for many types of human cancer. However, mining the data to uncover the hidden gene-interaction patterns remains a challenge. Gaussian graphical model (GGM) is often used to learn genetic networks because it defines an undirected graphical structure, revealing the conditional dependences of genes. In this study, we focus on inferring gene interactions in 15 specific types of human cancer using RNA-Seq expression data and GGM with graphical lasso. We take advantage of the corresponding Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway maps to define the subsets of related genes. RNA-Seq expression levels of the subsets of genes in solid cancerous tumor and normal tissues were extracted from TCGA. The gene expression data sets were cleaned and formatted, and the genetic network corresponding to each cancer type was then inferred using GGM with graphical lasso. The inferred networks reveal stable conditional dependences among the genes at the expression level and confirm the essential roles played by the genes that encode proteins involved in the two key signaling pathway phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK in human carcinogenesis. These stable dependences elucidate the expression level interactions among the genes that are implicated in many different human cancers. The inferred genetic networks were examined to further identify and characterize a collection of gene interactions that are unique to cancer. The cross-cancer genetic interactions revealed from our study provide another set of knowledge for cancer biologists to propose strong hypotheses, so further biological investigations can be conducted effectively.",2019,Bioinformatics and Biology Insights
Alternating direction method of multipliers for nonconvex fused regression problems,"It is well-known that the fused least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (FLASSO) has been playing an important role in signal and image processing. Recently, the nonconvex penalty is extensively investigated due to its success in sparse learning. In this paper, a novel nonconvex fused regression model, which integrates FLASSO and the nonconvex penalty nicely, is proposed. The developed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach is shown to be very efficient owing to the fact that each derived subproblem has a closed-form solution. In addition, the convergence is discussed and proved mathematically. This leads to a fast and convergent algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments show that our proposed nonconvex fused regression outperforms the state-of-the-art approach FLASSO.",2019,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Classification Analysis of Chronological Age Using Brief Resting Electroencephalographic (EEG) Recordings,"The present study aims to build a classification model that discriminates between chronological ages of subjects based on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from a community sample of 269 children aged 7 to 11. Specifically, spectral power densities in four classical frequency bands: Delta (0.5â€“3 Hz), Theta (4â€“7 Hz), Alpha (8â€“12 Hz) and Beta (14â€“25 Hz) were extracted for each electrode as features, and fed to three classification algorithms including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensions of the feature space. The results demonstrated that SVM and Lasso evidenced better performance (maximal accuracy = 80.68 Â± 2.01% by SVM and 77.82 Â± 2.11% by Lasso) when applied to original feature space, but LR yielded the best performance with PCA (80.72 Â± 1.73%). The accuracy of binary classification exhibited a decreasing trend with diminishing chronological gaps between the groups.",2015,
A variational Bayesian approach for inverse problems with skew-t error distributions,"In this work, we develop a novel robust Bayesian approach to inverse problems with data errors following a skew-t distribution. A hierarchical Bayesian model is developed in the inverse problem setup. The Bayesian approach contains a natural mechanism for regularization in the form of a prior distribution, and a LASSO type prior distribution is used to strongly induce sparseness. We propose a variational type algorithm by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior distribution and a separable approximation. The proposed method is illustrated on several two-dimensional linear and nonlinear inverse problems, e.g. Cauchy problem and permeability estimation problem.",2015,J. Comput. Phys.
On the Linear Convergence of a Proximal Gradient Method for a Class of Nonsmooth Convex Minimization Problems,"We consider a class of nonsmooth convex optimization problems where the objective function is the composition of a strongly convex differentiable function with a linear mapping, regularized by the sum of both â„“1-norm and â„“2-norm of the optimization variables. This class of problems arise naturally from applications in sparse group Lasso, which is a popular technique for variable selection. An effective approach to solve such problems is by the Proximal Gradient Method (PGM). In this paper we prove a local error bound around the optimal solution set for this problem and use it to establish the linear convergence of the PGM method without assuming strong convexity of the overall objective function.",2013,Journal of the Operations Research Society of China

Lasso-Based Linear Regression for Interval Valued Data,"In regression analysis the relationship between one response and a set of explanatory variables is investigated. The (response and explanatory) variables are usually single-valued. However, in several real-life situations, the available information may be formalized in terms of intervals. An interval-valued datum can be described by the midpoint (its center) and the radius (its half width). Here, limiting our attention to the linear case, regression analysis for interval-valued data is studied. This is done by considering two linear regression models. One model investigates the relationship between the midpoints of the response variable and of the explanatory variables, whereas the other one analyzes the relationship between the radii. The two models are related by considering the same regression coecients, i.e. the same linear relationship is assumed for the midpoints and the radii. However, in some cases, this assumption may be too restrictive. To overcome this drawback, additive coecients for the model of the radii are introduced and their magnitude is tuned according to the Lasso technique allowing us to set to zero some of these additive coecients. In order to show how the proposed method works in practice the results of an application to real-life data are discussed.",2011,
Accelerated reconstruction of a compressively sampled data stream,"The traditional compressed sensing approach is naturally offline, in that it amounts to sparsely sampling and reconstructing a given dataset. Recently, an online algorithm for performing compressed sensing on streaming data was proposed: the scheme uses recursive sampling of the input stream and recursive decompression to accurately estimate stream entries from the acquired noisy measurements. In this paper, we develop a novel Newton-type forward-backward proximal method to recursively solve the regularized Least-Squares problem (LASSO) online. We establish global convergence of our method as well as a local quadratic convergence rate. Our simulations show a substantial speed-up over the state of the art which may render the proposed method suitable for applications with stringent real-time constraints.",2016,2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
Theoretical Basis for the Separation of W and Mo with Manganese Dioxide: A Speciation-Based Approach,"The separation of W and Mo has been a technical problem in extractive metallurgy. It is known that manganese nodule (mainly manganese oxides) can adsorb W efficiently in the thalassochemistry; if there exists a difference between the adsorption behaviors of W and Mo onto manganese dioxide, then W/Mo separation may be achieved using manganese dioxide. In this paper, the adsorption characteristics of W and Mo onto â€˜â€˜nascentâ€™â€™ manganese dioxide were studied under different pH, ionic strength, and different concentration. The results showed that the adsorption of W onto manganese dioxide was higher than Mo both in single-sorbate solution and mixed solution. Besides, ionic strength had no impact on the W and Mo adsorption, while pH significantly affected the W and Mo adsorption. The adsorption of W followed the Freundlich isotherm, indicating that the surface of manganese dioxide was heterogeneous. Speciation-based model was developed to describe the W and Mo adsorption onto manganese dioxide. This model can be well applicable for describing the adsorption behavior of W and Mo in a wide pH range of 2 to 12 and a wide surface loading range. Besides, the optimum pH range of W/Mo separation in mixed solution predicted by this model was 6 to 6.5, which agrees well with the experimental results, and the separation factor achieved the maximum value 7 at this optimum pH range. Such model offers an important insight into the adsorption mechanism of W and Mo onto manganese dioxide, and lays a theoretical foundation for the process of separating W and Mo with manganese dioxide.",2015,Metallurgical and Materials Transactions B

Group sparse optimization by alternating direction method,"This paper proposes efficient algorithms for group sparse optimization with mixed l2,1-regularization, which arises from the reconstruction of group sparse signals in compressive sensing, and the group Lasso problem in statistics and machine learning. It is known that encoding the group information in addition to sparsity can often lead to better signal recovery/feature selection. The l2,1-regularization promotes group sparsity, but the resulting problem, due to the mixed-norm structure and possible grouping irregularity, is considered more difficult to solve than the conventional l1-regularized problem. Our approach is based on a variable splitting strategy and the classic alternating direction method (ADM). Two algorithms are presented, one derived from the primal and the other from the dual of the l2,1-regularized problem. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is guaranteed by the existing ADM theory. General group configurations such as overlapping groups and incomplete covers can be easily handled by our approach. Computational results show that on random problems the proposed ADM algorithms exhibit good efficiency, and strong stability and robustness.",2013,

Thalassotherapy for fibromyalgia: a randomized controlled trial comparing aquatic exercises in sea water and water pool,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of aerobic exercise in water pool compared with aerobic exercise performed in sea by women with fibromyalgia (FM). A total of 46 patients were randomly allocated into two groups: pool group (23 patients) and sea group (23 patients) that performed the same aerobic exercise program. Patients were evaluated baseline and after 12Â weeks using: VAS, number of tender points, FIQ, SF-36, PSQI, and BDI. Both groups improved significantly in post-treatment for all the evaluated variables. There were no significant differences between two groups, except for BDI (FÂ =Â 2.418, PÂ <Â 0.0001). Aerobic exercise program performed in water (pool or sea) was effective for patients with FM. However, sea water exercises have been shown to bring more advantages related to emotional aspects.

A machine learning-based model for 1-year mortality prediction in patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit with a diagnosis of sepsis.,"INTRODUCTION
Sepsis is associated to a high mortality rate, and its severity must be evaluated quickly. The severity of illness scores used are intended to be applicable to all patient populations, and generally evaluate in-hospital mortality. However, patients with sepsis continue to be at risk of death after hospital discharge.


OBJECTIVE
To develop a model for predicting 1-year mortality in critical patients diagnosed with sepsis.


PATIENTS
The data corresponding to 5650 admissions of patients with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database were evaluated, randomly divided as follows: 70% for training and 30% for validation.


DESIGN
A retrospective register-based cohort study was carried out. The clinical information of the first 24h after admission was used to develop a 1-year mortality prediction model based on Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) methodology. Variable selection was addressed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and SGB variable importance methodologies. The predictive power was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC).


RESULTS
An AUROC of 0.8039 (95% confidence interval (CI): [0.8033 0.8045]) was obtained in the validation subset. The model exceeded the predictive performances obtained with traditional severity of disease scores in the same subset.


CONCLUSION
The use of assembly algorithms, such as SGB, for the generation of a customized model for sepsis yields more accurate 1-year mortality prediction than the traditional scoring systems such as SAPS II, SOFA or OASIS.",2018,Medicina intensiva
A new training algorithm using artificial neural networks to classify gender-specific dynamic gait patterns,"The aim of this study was to present a new training algorithm using artificial neural networks called multi-objective least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (MOBJ-LASSO) applied to the classification of dynamic gait patterns. The movement pattern is identified by 20 characteristics from the three components of the ground reaction force which are used as input information for the neural networks in gender-specific gait classification. The classification performance between MOBJ-LASSO (97.4%) and multi-objective algorithm (MOBJ) (97.1%) is similar, but the MOBJ-LASSO algorithm achieved more improved results than the MOBJ because it is able to eliminate the inputs and automatically select the parameters of the neural network. Thus, it is an effective tool for data mining using neural networks. From 20 inputs used for training, MOBJ-LASSO selected the first and second peaks of the vertical force and the force peak in the antero-posterior direction as the variables that classify the gait patterns of the different genders.",2015,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering

Radiomic analysis of planning computed tomograms for predicting radiation-induced lung injury and outcome in lung cancer patients treated with robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy,"ObjectivesTo predict radiation-induced lung injury and outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) from radiomic features of the primary tumor.MethodsIn all, 110 patients with primary stageÂ I/IIa NSCLC were analyzed for local control (LC), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and development of local lung injury up to fibrosis (LF). First-order (histogram), second-order (GLCM, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) and shape-related radiomic features were determined from the unprocessed or filtered planning CT images of the gross tumor volume (GTV), subjected to LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization and used to construct continuous and dichotomous risk scores for each endpoint.ResultsContinuous scores comprising 1â€“5 histogram or GLCM features had aÂ significant (pâ€¯=â€‰0.0001â€“0.032) impact on all endpoints that was preserved in aÂ multifactorial Cox regression analysis comprising additional clinical and dosimetric factors. At 36Â months, LC did not differ between the dichotomous risk groups (93% vs. 85%, HR 0.892, 95%CI 0.222â€“3.590), while DFS (45% vs. 17%, pâ€¯<â€‰0.05, HR 0.457, 95%CI 0.240â€“0.868) and OS (80% vs. 37%, pâ€¯<â€‰0.001, HR 0.190, 95%CI 0.065â€“0.556) were significantly lower in the high-risk groups. Also, the frequency of LF differed significantly between the two risk groups (63% vs. 20% at 24Â months, pâ€¯<â€‰0.001, HR 0.158, 95%CI 0.054â€“0.458).ConclusionRadiomic analysis of the gross tumor volume may help to predict DFS and OS and the development of local lung fibrosis in early stage NSCLC patients treated with stereotactic radiotherapy.ZusammenfassungZielVorhersage von pulmonaler ToxizitÃ¤t und onkologischem Ergebnis aus Radiomics-Merkmalen des PrimÃ¤rtumors bei Patienten mit nicht-kleinzelligem Bronchialkarzinom (NSCLC), die mittels robotischer stereotaktischer Strahlentherapie (SBRT) behandelt wurden.MethodenInsgesamt 110Â Patienten mit NSCLC im StadiumÂ I/IIa wurden bzgl. lokaler Kontrolle (LC), krankheitsfreiem Ãœberleben (DFS), GesamtÃ¼berleben (OS) und Entwicklung einer lokalen Lungenfibrose (LF) untersucht.

Prediction of preeclampsia utilizing the first trimester screening examination.,"OBJECTIVE
To derive a prediction rule for preeclampsia and early onset preeclampsia requiring delivery <34 weeks using first trimester maternal, ultrasound, and serum markers.


STUDY DESIGN
Prospective cohort study of women enrolled at first trimester screening. Maternal history, demographics, anthropometry, ultrasound parameters, and serum analytes were compared between women with preeclampsia and normal outcome. The prediction rule was derived by Lasso logistic regression analysis.


RESULTS
In 2441 women, 108 (4.4%) women developed preeclampsia, and 18 (0.7%) early preeclampsia. Nulliparity, prior hypertension, diabetes, prior preeclampsia, mean arterial pressure, and the log pregnancy-associate pregnancy protein-A multiples of the median were primary risk factors. Prediction rules for preeclampsia/early preeclampsia had an area under the curve of 0.82/0.83 respectively. Preeclampsia was predicted with 49% sensitivity and early preeclampsia with 55% sensitivity for a 10% false positive rate.


CONCLUSION
First trimester prediction rules using parameters currently available at first trimester screening identify a significant proportion of women with subsequent preeclampsia.",2014,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology
Reassessing the relationship between landscape alteration and aquatic ecosystem degradation from a hydrologically sensitive area perspective.,"This study applies a novel landscape approach to empirically assess the linkage between terrestrial landscape alteration such as urbanization and aquatic ecosystem degradation from a hydrological sensitive area (HSA) perspective in 141 selected northern New Jersey watersheds. HSAs are hydrological ""hotspots"" in a watershed that actively contribute to runoff generation and were delineated using a soil topographic index. Land use metrics captured landscape alterations in terms of percentages of varying land uses in these watersheds and their HSAs. Aquatic ecosystem integrity was represented by a High Gradient Macroinvertebrate Index (HGMI) specifically developed for the stream types assessed in this study. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis was used to understand the relationships between land use metrics and HGMI score at the watershed- and HSA-scales and a data fitting procedure called Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was used to identify the most statistically significant land use attributes to be retained in the MLR models. The modeling results at the HSA-scale showed more parsimonious and robust relationships between landscape alteration and aquatic integrity than at the watershed-scale in terms of both variable selection and statistical inference. While high intensity urbanization is a known stressor that can significantly degrade aquatic ecosystem integrity, the results indicate that landscapes developed more strategically by way of low intensity urbanization (e.g., rural residential) or on less hydrologically sensitive areas may lessen the detrimental effects of urbanization on aquatic ecosystem integrity. These findings support the premise that it is not just the extent of urbanization in a watershed that matters, but also the intensity and location of the disturbance on the landscape that affects aquatic ecosystem integrity. Such findings may encourage more flexible landscape planning and management practices that better protect HSAs from urban development in support of long-term aquatic ecosystem protection and restoration.",2019,The Science of the total environment
Detecting Rare Haplotype-Environment Interaction and Dynamic Effects of Rare Haplotypes using Logistic Bayesian LASSO,"Rare variants and gene-environment interaction (GXE) are believed to be two important contributors to â€œmissing heritabilityâ€. Thus, detecting GXE where G is a rare haplotype variant (rHTV) is a pressing problem. Haplotype analysis is usually the natural second step to follow up on a genomic region that is implicated to be associated through common single nucleotide variants (SNV) analysis. Further, rHTV can tag associated rare SNV (rSNV) and may provide greater power to detect them than popular collapsing methods. In this dissertation, we undertake the idea of Logistic Bayesian LASSO (LBL) and incorporate environmental factors (E) and their interactions with haplotypes (GXE) in LBL using case-control data, leading to LBL-GXE. By adopting the Markov chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) methods and choosing appropriate priors, LBL shrinks the effects of unassociated (especially common) haplotypes towards zero so that an associated rHTV can be identified with greater power. We investigate the performance of LBL-GXE under extensive simulation models involving different combinations of rare and common associated haplotypes. The results show that LBL-GXE has reasonably good powers for detecting interactions with rHTV while keeping the type I error rates well-controlled. ii We also apply the approach (LBL-GXE) to the Michigan, Mayo, AREDS, Pennsylvania (MMAP) Cohort Study on Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). LBLGXE detects the interaction of a specific rHTV in the Complement Factor H (CFH) gene with smoking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the AMD literature that an interaction of smoking with a specific (rather than pooled) rHTV has been implicated. The behavior of a gene can be dynamic, thus it is important that we study the dynamic effect of gene overtime, the second topic of this dissedtation. We model the effect of both rare and common haplotype pairs by time-varying coefficients (tvc) using B-spline with longitudinal data. Furthermore, the effects of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions are also incorporated using the LBL, leading to LBLtvc methodology. Unlike LBL-GXE, LBL-tvc is based on a prospective likelihood since longitudinal data are collected forward in time over a certain period, typically in a cohort study. We also carry out a variety of simulations to evaluate the properties of LBL-tvc and to assess its robustness to model mis-specification. LBL-tvc is able to detect the trend of effects of gene at different ages with reasonable good power and wellcontrolled Type I error. Even when the simulation model does not match with the proposed model, it can still detect the effects of gene-environment interaction with reasonable good power. The T2D-GENEs date made available by the Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 (http://www.gaworkshop.org/gaw18/index.html) are used to demonstrate the performance of LBL-tvc in practice. We apply LBL-tvc to analyze different regions of interest on chromosome 3 along with smoking, smoking-gene interaction, and sex on iii their effects on hypertension. Several haplotypes (including some rare ones) and interactions are identified to be associated with hypertension with varying effect sizes in these regions.",2014,
Politics : antiqvity and its legacy,"Ancient Greece is famous as the civilization which 'gave' the world democracy. Democracy has in modern times become the rallying cry of liberation from supposed totalitarianism and dictatorship. And the desire by the western powers, especially America, to foment (or impose) democracy across the globe is one of the most powerful driving motors in present-day geopolitics: not least in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thus, a lively and well informed treatment of the nexus between politics in antiquity and political discourse in the modern era is both timely and apposite. As Kostas Vlassopoulos shows, much can be learned about the practice of politics from a comparative discussion of the classical and the contemporary. His starting point is that the value of looking back to a political system with different assumptions and elements can help us think, and even shape, what the future of modern politics might be. He discusses the contrasting political systems prevalent in the Greek city-states of Athens, Sparta and Corinth; tensions between democrats and oligarchs in Periclean Athens; the bitter rivalries which led to the Peloponnesian Wars in the fifth century BCE; and, the delicate balance of powers between people, senate and emperor in the hierarchical society of republican and latterly imperial Rome. Above all, the book shows how important and surprising the study of antiquity can be in reassessing and revaluating modern political debates.",2010,
Detecting managerâ€™s fraud risk using text analysis: evidence from Iran,"In accounting and finance, researchers have used many ways to detect managerâ€™s fraud risk. Until now, many researchers have used some data mining methods in these two fields to detect this risk. The purpose of this paper is to compare the precision of two data mining methods in detecting such a risk.,For this purpose, this paper analyzed the texts of boardâ€™s reports and used two methods including the convex optimization (CVX) method and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method. In this way, the words of these reports, which have the greatest power in explaining the managerâ€™s high fraud risk index, were identified. Using these words, this paper presented a model that could detect managerâ€™s high fraud risk index in companies.,The results indicated that both methods can detect the managerâ€™s high fraud risk index with a precision between 82.55 and 91.25 percent. The LASSO method was significantly more precise than the CVX method.,The lack of access to an official and reliable list of firms suspected to fraud and the lack of access to the Microsoft Word (MS Word) file of boardâ€™s reports were two of the most important limitations of this study.,Regulatory bodies and independent auditors can consider the proposed methods in this study for assessing the fraud risk for a firm or other legal parties.,This paper avoided using merely financial statements data to detect the managerâ€™s fraud risk index and focused on texts of boardâ€™s reports for the detection process. The capabilities of data mining and text mining methods for detecting the managerâ€™s fraud risk index using boardâ€™s reports were tested in this paper. By comparing CVX and LASSO results, this paper indicated that methods with a binary-dependent variable have more power and are more precise than methods with continuous-dependent variables for detecting fraud.",2019,Journal of Applied Accounting Research
Flocking behaviour and territorial competitors,"Cleaning symbiosis (allogrooming) is an important interspecific interaction in the marine environment . Substrate-feeding organisms are particularly well adapted for facultative cleaning, the integument of the host serving as the feeding substratum . Such facultative (parttime) cleaners are non-host specific, to the extent that they will attempt to clean the skin of human divers . Juvenile angelfishes (Pomacanthus arcuatus and P. paru) in Florida waters are reported to clean human divers as well as other fishes (Brockmann & Hailman 1976). I observed similar behaviour in a juvenile P. zonipectus in the Gulf of Cali fornia, which nipped at damaged tissue around a wound on my ankle. The encounter was brief, but the feeding movements and postures were similar to those exhibited by this species when feeding on sponges, algae, and other benthic organisms in nature and in aquaria (Reynolds & Reynolds 1977), and is similar to that of other Pomacanthus species (Brockmann & Hailman 1976). I have not seen these clean other fish in the field, but did find a ctenoid scale in the stomach of an adult in an earlier feeding study (Reynolds & Reynolds 1977) . Randall & Hartman (1968) report the presence of crustacean ectoparasites of reef fishes in stomachs of juvenile Pomacanthus and Holacanthus angelfishes from the West Indies. Other Gulf of California fishes which I have observed to clean humans by gently nibbling at the skin or tugging at body hairs are the wrasse 7halassoma lucasanum (Labridae), the goby Elacatinus digueti (Gobiidae), juvenile sergeant majors (Abudefduf trosche, Pomacentridae), and juvenile mojarras (Eucinostomus sp., Gerreidae): see Thomson & McKibbin (1976) for identification and descriptions. I have also observed cleaning behaviour in two species of prawns (Palaemonidae), which I believe to be the first such behaviour reported for this euryhaline (Reynolds 1975) family . In a freshwater spring entering an intertidal pool at the small embayment of El Coyote off the larger Bahia Concepcion, Baja California Sur, I was cleaned by freshwater prawns of the genus Macrobrachium, identifiable by the characteristic very long chelipeds . Approaching me cautiously as I sat in the shallow pool, these first tested my skin with the extended chelae, and then having discovered the area of keratinized cuticle around my fingernails, applied the mouthparts directly to the cuticle and gave me a thorough manicure, the larger ones fending off smaller individuals with the extended long chelipeds . They persisted in this until I moved .",1977,Animal Behaviour
"Osteology and Functional Morphology of the Forelimb of the Marine Sloth Thalassocnus (Mammalia, Tardigrada)","Thalassocnus is a genus of â€œground slothsâ€ known from Neogene deposits, for the great majority of specimens, of the Pisco Formation (Peru). Five species are recognized, their description being currently restricted, for the most part, to the skull, mandible, and dentition. The bones of the forelimb are here described, and compared among the species of Thalassocnus and to other pilosans. The main characteristics of the forelimb of Thalassocnus relative to other sloths are the shortness of the humerus and radius, and the specialized digits. Moreover, the late species of the genus are characterized by the development of the pronator ridge of the radius, stoutness of the ulna, widening of the proximal carpal row, and shortening of the metacarpals. Analogies with extant tetrapods are proposed in order to infer plausible aquatic functions of the forelimb of Thalassocnus. In addition to paddling, it is argued that the forelimb of Thalassocnus was involved in bottom-walking, a function similarly found in extant sirenians. However, the function of the forelimb of Thalassocnus differs drastically from that of the latter, since it was likely involved in an activity related to obtaining food such as uprooting seagrass rhizomes.",2014,Journal of Mammalian Evolution

Ensembling methods for countrywide short term forecasting of gas demand.,"Gas demand is made of three components: Residential, Industrial, and Thermoelectric Gas Demand. Herein, the one-day-ahead prediction of each component is studied, using Italian data as a case study. Statistical properties and relationships with temperature are discussed, as a preliminary step for an effective feature selection. Nine ""base forecasters"" are implemented and compared: Ridge Regression, Gaussian Processes, Nearest Neighbours, Artificial Neural Networks, Torus Model, LASSO, Elastic Net, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Based on them, four ensemble predictors are crafted: simple average, weighted average, subset average, and SVR aggregation. We found that ensemble predictors perform consistently better than base ones. Moreover, our models outperformed Transmission System Operator (TSO) predictions in a two-year out-of-sample validation. Such results suggest that combining predictors may lead to significant performance improvements in gas demand forecasting.",2020,arXiv: Learning
Marketing Mix Modelling from multiple regression perspective,"The optimal allocation of the marketing budget has become a di cult issue that each company is facing. With the appearance of new marketing techniques, such as online advertising and social media advertising, the complexity of data has increased, making this problem even more challenging. Statistical tools for explanatory and predictive modelling have commonly been used to tackle the problem of budget allocation. Marketing Mix Modelling involves the use of a range of statistical methods which are suitable for modelling the variable of interest (in this thesis it is sales) in terms of advertising strategies and external variables, with the aim to construct an optimal combination of marketing strategies that would maximize the pro t. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate a number of regression-based model building strategies, with the focus on advanced regularization methods of linear regression, with the analysis of advantages and disadvantages of each method. Several crucial problems that modern marketing mix modelling is facing are discussed in the thesis. These include the choice of the most appropriate functional form that describes the relationship between the set of explanatory variables and the response, modelling the dynamical structure of marketing environment by choosing the optimal decays for each marketing advertising strategy, evaluating the seasonality e ects and collinearity of marketing instruments. To e ciently tackle two common challenges when dealing with marketing data, which are multicollinearity and selection of informative variables, regularization methods are exploited. In particular, the performance accuracy of ridge regression, the lasso, the naive elastic net and elastic net is compared using cross-validation approach for the selection of tuning parameters. Speci c practical recommendations for modelling and analyzing Nepa marketing data are provided.

Comparison of the Results between Circumferential Pulmonary Vein Isolation and Stepwise Substrate Catheter Ablation for the Treatment of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation,"Objective To explore the curative effects and safety of the randomly circumferential pulmonary veins isolation(CPVI) with stepwise substrate catheter ablation(SSCA).Methods 62 patients of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were randomly divided into the CPVI group(n=38) and the SSCA group(n=24).CARTO and Lasso circular mapping catheter were used to guide ablation,and through these ECGs and Holter's ECGs of follow-up visit,the exposure time,operating time and recurrence rate of the two groups were compared.Results The X-ray exposure time of the CPVI group and the SSCA group was(33.32Â±6.03)minutes and(33.42Â±3.93minutes)respectively,and the surgery time of the two group was(125.66Â±11.78)minutes and(131.13Â±10.47)minutes respectively,with no significant contrast existed between the two groups.The six-month follow-up reveaked that the rates of no-recurrence of the SSCA group and the CPVI group were 86.8% and 62.5% respectively.Conclusion In the long term,no-recurrence rate in the CPVI group is higher than in the SSCA group,but this needs further follow-up visit.The breakthrough of the study of mechanisms of atrial fibrillation is the key to the treatment of atrial fibrillation.",2011,Journal of Shandong Medical College
Quality Changes in Vaccinia Virus during Adaptation to Growth in Cultures of Earle's L Cells.,"Sharp, D. G. (University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill), P. Sadhukhan, and G. J. Galasso. Quality changes in vaccinia virus during adaptation to growth in cultures of Earle's L cells. J. Bacteriol. 88:309-312. 1964.-Although particle production improves rapidly with passage of vaccinia (mouse neurotropic strain) virus in L cells, plaque production improves much more slowly. Beyond the passage when maximal particle yield was reached (18th), further improvement in plaquing quality of 1,000-fold was observed. Particle count and plaque titrations showed that plaquing efficiency improves at comparable rates in either plaque-to-plaque passage on plates or in tube cultures inoculated at high multiplicity. The host cell is probably exerting some influence in addition to that of the selection of mutants from the initial population.",1964,Journal of bacteriology
"Nesting ecology of the interior least tern on the Yellowstone River, Montana","I estimated the number of interior least terns (Sterna antillarum athalassos) on the Yellowstone River, Montana, quantified available nesting habitat at 3 river-flow rates, and characterized nesting habitat during the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons. In 1994, run-off from mountain snow-pack occurred I month earlier than historically and in 1995. Mean monthly flow rates in 1995 exceeded historical rates by 150 cubic meters/second (cms) and by 600 cms rates in 1994. More adult least terns were observed during 1994 (n = 40) than in 1995 (n In 1994 and 1995, peak nest initiation occurred between 8-21 June (x = 457.4 cms, SE = 73.1), and 22 June 5 July (x = 1,064.4 cms, SE = 99.1), respectively. Vegetated channel bars were used exclusively for nesting during both years; 10 different channel bars were colonized, 9 were used in 1994, 5 of which were recolonized in 1995. Average colony size was 1.93 nests/colony. Mean reproductive estimates for 1994 and 1995 were: apparent nest success, 76.3 %; fledglings/nesting pair, 0.73; and clutch size, 2.38. In 1994, 23 young were fledged, whereas only I was fledged in 1995. A longer breeding season, due to earlier peak flows and lower river levels earlier in the season, likely contributed to more successful reproduction in 1994. In addition, weather-related mortality of eggs and chicks may have further compromised reproductive efforts in 1995. Nests were not inundated by floods during either season. Human disturbance of nesting colonies was not observed and only I predation event was witnessed. Channel bars chosen for nesting sites were exposed above river level longer throughout the breeding season than non-nesting available habitats. In addition, there was no difference detected among heights of nesting cobble areas along 100 m transects that traversed the highest area of the cobble dome. Tem nests were placed in micro sites of the cobble area with heights equal to or greater than those along the crest of the cobble area. Most nest colonies and nests occurred in a section of the river where channel sinuosity began to increase and there was a higher incidence of channel bars and overlapping islands (land masses with mature vegetation) surrounded by irregular channel activity (i.e., sloughs). Because of the increase in channel sinuosity, deposition of sediment and bedload materials may be greater on channel bars in this section of the river channel. The rapid stage fluctuation and sediment carrying capacity of the free-flowing Yellowstone River likely contribute to the maintenance of the early successional stage of channel bar nesting habitat. Though inundation from dam releases on the Yellowstone River is nonexistent, there is a danger of flooding nesting terns from controlled tributaries (Big Horn and Tongue Rivers). Simultaneous releases from dams, especially periods of increased discharge rates on the Yellowstone, will place least tern reproductive efforts on the Yellowstone River in serious danger of inundation. Communication among individuals responsible for water regulation on the Big Horn and Tongue Rivers will help reduce threats to the Yellowstone River least tern population.",1996,
Stochastic primal dual fixed point method for composite optimization,"In this paper we propose a stochastic primal dual fixed point method (SPDFP) for solving the sum of two proper lower semi-continuous convex function and one of which is composite. The method is based on the primal dual fixed point method (PDFP) proposed in [7] that does not require subproblem solving. Under some mild condition, the convergence is established based on two sets of assumptions: bounded and unbounded gradients and the convergence rate of the expected error of iterate is of the order O(kâˆ’Î±) where k is iteration number and Î± âˆˆ (0, 1]. Finally, numerical examples on graphic Lasso and logistic regressions are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",2020,

The trace of the missionaries,"The morass in town is getting tougher; soon the murder of a prominent figure, perpetrated by a gang led by Phantom, has worsened the already unbearable situation whereas the Community Security Squad is making its effort to completely curb the bad situation. Ricardo the son of the most famous artist has a pet called Badboy, a skilled and smart chimpanzee. The latter, disgusted by the sad situation in town personally lassos down three men of a gang during delivery and the Community Security Squad makes a decisive arrest. Sheriff honors Badboyâ€™s effort by offering him a place in the Community Security Squad with the rank of a Sergeant. Badboyâ€™s decision to turn down Sheriffâ€™s honor is for a purpose since he is aware it is his hand that is behind his masterâ€™s fame. Both Ricardo and his pet later play nasty tricks on the so-called missionaries, and the fight for freedom and justice equally leads to the arrest of the American explorers who sneak into the rich land through the high lands. In the end Phantom and his men narrowly escape the claws of the law by running away into the forest, leaving behind a bitter trace in the hearts of thousands of people.",2014,
Local Q-linear convergence and finite-time active set identification of ADMM on a class of penalized regression problems,"We study the convergence of the ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) algorithm on a broad range of penalized regression problems including the Lasso, Group-Lasso and Graph-Lasso,(isotropic) TV-L1, Sparse Variation, and others. First, we establish a fixed-point iteration via a nonlinear operator-which is equivalent to the ADMM iterates. We then show that this nonlinear operator is FreÌchet-differentiable almost everywhere and that around each fixed point, Q-linear convergence is guaranteed, provided the spectral radius of the Jacobian of the operator at the fixed point is less than 1 (a classical result on stability). Moreover, this spectral radius is then a rate of convergence for the ADMM algorithm. Also, we show that the support of the split variable can be identified after finitely many iterations. In the anisotropic cases, we show that for sufficiently large values of the tuning parameter, we recover the optimal rates in terms of Friedrichs angles, that have appeared recently in the literature. Empirical results on various problems are also presented and discussed.",2016,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Variable selection for zero-inflated and overdispersed data with application to health care demand in Germany.,"In health services and outcome research, count outcomes are frequently encountered and often have a large proportion of zeros. The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model has important applications for this type of data. With many possible candidate risk factors, this paper proposes new variable selection methods for the ZINB model. We consider maximum likelihood function plus a penalty including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), and minimax concave penalty (MCP). An EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm is proposed for estimating the model parameters and conducting variable selection simultaneously. This algorithm consists of estimating penalized weighted negative binomial models and penalized logistic models via the coordinated descent algorithm. Furthermore, statistical properties including the standard error formulae are provided. A simulation study shows that the new algorithm not only has more accurate or at least comparable estimation, but also is more robust than the traditional stepwise variable selection. The proposed methods are applied to analyze the health care demand in Germany using the open-source R package mpath.",2015,Biometrical journal. Biometrische Zeitschrift
Part I: Slave Systems of Production in the African Interior: Case Studies from the Sudanic Belt-2 Segou: Warfare and the Origins of a State of Slavery,"Â© The British Academy 2011. All rights reserved. The Bamana state of Segou (c.1700-1861) has been used as an exemplar of the slave system of economic production amongst Sahelian states by anthropologists and historians such as Bazin (1974), Roberts (1987), and Meillassoux (1991). However, little is known about the nature of Segou's connection to broader slave-trading networks of the time or, from an archaeological perspective, how such slave systems of production may be viewed in terms of settlement types or patterns. This chapter addresses aspects of these two puzzles through the field research of Project Segou, a collaboration between University College London and the Malian Institut des Sciences Humaines. It concentrates on results from the 2006 season directed by the authors - fieldwork which focused on the nature and history of Segou's slave economy. The chapter summarizes findings on the functioning of the Segovian slave system of production, and then briefly considers two case studies: one concerning Segou's first major war of enslavement, and a second examining two of Segou's enigmatic Sifinso (or 'schools of the black hair'), places which may have played an important role in the mental conditioning of select groups of new captives.",2011,
Multinomial functional regression with wavelets and LASSO penalization,"A classification problem with a functional predictor is studied, and it is suggested to use a multinomial functional regression (MFR) model for the analysis. The discrete wavelet transform and LASSO penalization are combined for estimation, and the fitted model is used for classification of new curves with unknown class membership. The MFR approach is applied to two datasets, one regarding lameness detection for horses and another regarding speech recognition. In the applications, as well as in a simulation study, the performance of the MFR approach is compared to that of other methods for supervised classification of functional data, and MFR performs as well or better than the other methods.",2017,Econometrics and Statistics
Biogeography of the tropical seagrasses in the western Pacific,"Seagrass species and their distributions were recorded from 18 localities in the tropical and subtropical Pacific. These field observations were collated with a review of the recent literature, enabling the present distribution patterns of seagrass species in the western Pacific to be described and the origin of those species to be discussed in relation to the major oceanic currents of the region. The major tropical seagrasses of the western Pacific are Thalassia hemprichii, Enhalus acoroides, Cymodocea rotundata, C. serrulata, Halodule uninervis, Syringodium isoetifolium and Thalassodendron ciliatum, with T. hemprichii and E. acoroides being the two most widely distributed species. Species are found in coastal waters along the Equatorial Countercurrent and the Kuroshio and East Australian Currents. The highest number of seagrass species occurs in the coastal waters of Malesia enclosed by Indonesia, Borneo, Papua New Guinea and the Torres Strait (northern Australia). This area is considered to be the source of all of the seagrass species of the western Pacific, i.e. the centre of their origin. A relationship between the distance from this centre of origin along the above three major ocean currents and the diversity of seagrass species was found: the further from the origin, the poorer the seagrass diversity. These observations support the centre-of-origin theory that was first proposed by den Hartog to describe the processes responsible for the present distribution patterns of seagrasses in the western Pacific.",1993,Marine and Freshwater Research
The distribution of model averaging estimators and an impossibility result regarding its estimation,"Model averaging or model mixing estimators have received increased interest in recent years; see, e.g., Yang [18, 19, 20], Magnus [13], Leung and Barron [12], and the references therein. [For a discussion of model averaging from a Bayesian perspective see Hoeting et al. [4].] The main idea behind this class of estimators is that averaging estimators obtained from different models should have the potential to achieve better overall risk performance when compared to a strategy that only uses the estimator obtained from one model. As a consequence, the above mentioned literature concentrates on studying the risk properties of model averaging estimators and on associated oracle inequalities. In this paper we derive the finite-sample as well as the asymptotic distribution (under fixed as well as under moving parameters) of the model averaging estimator studied in [12]; for the sake of simplicity we concentrate on the special case when only two candidate models are considered. Not too surprisingly, it turns out that the finite-sample distribution (after centering and scaling) depends on unknown parameters, and thus cannot be directly used for inferential purposes. As a consequence, one may be interested in estimators of this distribution, e.g., for purposes of conducting inference. We establish an impossibility result by showing that any estimator of the finite-sample distribution of the model averaging estimator is necessarily â€œbadâ€ in a sense made precise in Section 4. While we concentrate on Leung and Barronâ€™s [12] estimator (in the context of only two candidate models) as a prototypical example of a model averaging estimator in this paper, similar results will typically hold for other model averaging estimators (and more than two candidate models) as well. We note that results on distributional properties of post-model-selection estimators that parallel the development in the present paper have been obtained in [5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17]. See also Leeb and PÃ¶tscher [11] for impossibility results pertaining to shrinkage-type estimators like the Lasso or Steinâ€™s estimator. An easily accessible exposition of the issues discussed in the just mentioned literature can be found in Leeb and PÃ¶tscher [8].",2007,
An Algorithm for Iterative Selection of Blocks of Features,"We focus on the problem of linear regression estimation in high dimension, when the parameter Î² is ""sparse"" (most of its coordinates are 0) and ""blocky"" (Î²i and Î²i+1 are likely to be equal). Recently, some authors defined estimators taking into account this information, such as the Fused-LASSO [19] or the S-LASSO [10] among others. However, there are no theoretical results about the obtained estimators in the general design matrix case. Here, we propose an alternative point of view, based on the Iterative Feature Selection method [1]. We propose an iterative algorithm that takes into account the fact that Î² is sparse and blocky, with no prior knowledge on the position of the blocks. Moreover, we give a theoretical result that ensures that every step of our algorithm actually improves the statistical performance of the obtained estimator. We provide some simulations, where our method outperforms LASSO-type methods in the cases where the parameter is sparse and blocky. Moreover, we give an application to real data (CGH arrays), that shows that our estimator can be used on large datasets.",2010,
Image Coding using Generalized Predictors based on Sparsity and Geometric Transformations LuÄ±Ìs,"Directional intra prediction plays an important role in current state-of-the-art video coding standards. In directional prediction, neighbouring samples are projected along a specific direction to predict a block of samples. Ultimately, each prediction mode can be regarded as a set of very simple linear predictors, a different one for each pixel of a block. Therefore, a natural question that arises is whether one could use the theory of linear prediction in order to generate intra prediction modes that provide increased coding efficiency. However, such an interpretation of each directional mode as a set of linear predictors is too poor to provide useful insights for their design. In this paper we introduce an interpretation of directional prediction as a particular case of linear prediction, that uses first-order linear filters and a set of geometric transformations. This interpretation motivated the proposal of a generalized intra prediction framework, whereby the first-order linear filters are replaced by adaptive linear filters with sparsity constraints. In this context, we investigate the use of efficient sparse linear models, adaptively estimated for each block through the use of different algorithms, such as Matching Pursuit, Least Angle Regression, Lasso or Elastic Net. The proposed intra prediction framework was implemented and evaluated within the state-of-the-art high efficiency video coding standard. Experiments demonstrated the advantage of this predictive solution, mainly in the presence of images with complex features and textured areas, achieving higher average bitrate savings than other related sparse representation methods proposed in the literature.",2016,
Sparse-Input Neural Networks for High-dimensional Nonparametric Regression and Classification,"Neural networks are usually not the tool of choice for nonparametric high-dimensional problems where the number of input features is much larger than the number of observations. Though neural networks can approximate complex multivariate functions, they generally require a large number of training observations to obtain reasonable fits, unless one can learn the appropriate network structure. In this manuscript, we show that neural networks can be applied successfully to high-dimensional settings if the true function falls in a low dimensional subspace, and proper regularization is used. We propose fitting a neural network with a sparse group lasso penalty on the first-layer input weights, which results in a neural net that only uses a small subset of the original features. In addition, we characterize the statistical convergence of the penalized empirical risk minimizer to the optimal neural network: we show that the excess risk of this penalized estimator only grows with the logarithm of the number of input features; and we show that the weights of irrelevant features converge to zero. Via simulation studies and data analyses, we show that these sparse-input neural networks outperform existing nonparametric high-dimensional estimation methods when the data has complex higher-order interactions.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Aquatic and terrestrial vegetation of the Prespa area,"We studied the vegetation of the aquatic ecosystems ofLake Mikri Prespa. The lacustrine vegetationcomprises three distinct forms: floating plants,benthic hydrophytes and helophytes, which aredescribed and classified from the phytosociologicalpoint of view, as follows: (a) the vegetation of thefloating plants belong to the Lemnetea class and isrepresented by two plant communities; (b) thevegetation of the benthic hydrophytes, belongs to thePotametea class consisting of two differentcategories, namely the submersed formations and theemergent formations of the hydrophytes. Various plantcommunities were recognised in this type of vegetationand three among them are considered as the mostrepresentative; (c) the vegetation of helophytes, theprevailing life form in this wetland, belongs to thePhragmitetea class and is represented mainly by sevenwell organised plant communities. The respectivevegetation of two of the five more important wetlandsites is described.The terrestrial vegetation is composed of forestand meadow vegetation. The forest vegetation of theNational Park belongs to the class Querco-Fagetea andshows the following zonation: (a) in the vicinity ofthe lake, at the elevation of 860â€“1000 m, twoassociations have been found: the mixed deciduous andevergreen forests of Ostryo-Carpinion orientalis andthe evergreen forests of Ostryo-Carpinion adriaticum;(b) the deciduous oak forests surround the previouszone at the altitude of 900â€“1300 m with two principalassociations, namely the Quercetum frainetto and theQuercetum petraeae; (c) in the upper forest layerbetween 1200â€“1800 m asl, dominate beech forests of theassociation Fagion moesiacum and the less extensiveoccurrence of the mixed beech-fir stands (Ass.Abieti-Fagetum moesiacum).The zone above the tree limit is distinguished by itssubalpine character semi-shrub vegetation extendinghigher than the forest (1800â€“2000 m), whereas alpine meadowscover the vegetation at higheraltitudes.

Prognostic factors and predictions of survival data,"Survival outcome has been one of the major endpoints for clinical trials; it gives information on the probability of a time-to-event of interest. There has been increasing interest in survival analysis tools over the recent years, especially for high dimensional survival data. Common statistical approaches include nonparametric, semi-parametric and complete parametric analysis, several of which are widely used and readily available from major commercial software applications. However most of these approaches have limitations. Typical nonparametric approaches, such as the log-rank (or Cox-Mantel) test, are not concerned about model assumptions, but can only deal with a limited number of categorical predictors. Typical semi-parametric approaches, such as Cox proportional hazard model, depend very much on the model assumptions, such as linearity, interactions and proportionality; also these approaches can only deal with survival data when the number of predictors is less than the total number of events. Complete parametric models, such as accelerate failure time models, are similar to semi-parametric models except that they make further assumptions about the baseline hazard function. In this research paper, we studied several techniques for evaluating survival data, the typical Cox PH models including the generalized Cox linear model and the multivariate Cox regression models with nonlinear transformations, the nonparametric random survival forest approaches, penalized Cox regression models including lasso, ridge and elastic-net Cox regression models, derived-input Cox regression models including principal component Cox regression and partial least squares Cox regression models. These models were implemented and evaluated with one simulation study and one real world case study. The typical Cox models including the generalized Cox linear model and the multivariate Cox regression models with nonlinear transformations should always provide unbiased estimates, and the models are flexible for handling recurrent-event survival response; but they are incapable of making inferences for cases when there are more predictors than the actual number of events; and since they are semi-parametric",2014,
On the Inference of Functional Circadian Networks Using Granger Causality,"Being able to infer one way direct connections in an oscillatory network such as the suprachiastmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian brain using time series data is difficult but crucial to understanding network dynamics. Although techniques have been developed for inferring networks from time series data, there have been no attempts to adapt these techniques to infer directional connections in oscillatory time series, while accurately distinguishing between direct and indirect connections. In this paper an adaptation of Granger Causality is proposed that allows for inference of circadian networks and oscillatory networks in general called Adaptive Frequency Granger Causality (AFGC). Additionally, an extension of this method is proposed to infer networks with large numbers of cells called LASSO AFGC. The method was validated using simulated data from several different networks. For the smaller networks the method was able to identify all one way direct connections without identifying connections that were not present. For larger networks of up to twenty cells the method shows excellent performance in identifying true and false connections; this is quantified by an area-under-the-curve (AUC) 96.88%. We note that this method like other Granger Causality-based methods, is based on the detection of high frequency signals propagating between cell traces. Thus it requires a relatively high sampling rate and a network that can propagate high frequency signals.",2015,PLoS ONE
Influencing Factors on Chinese Wine Consumersâ€™ Behavior under Different Purchasing Motivations Based on a Multi-classification Method,"This study investigates the importance rating of influencing factors in driving wine consumption under four specific situations, that is, gift, banquet, party, and self-drinking, and thus achieves consumer segmentation. The affecting factors containing wine quality and socio-demographic variables are measured on a national representative sample (N=609) in China. Lasso method is used to select the factors, and a binary classifier v-twin support vector machine (v-TSVM) is extended to a multi-classification case by using a â€œone-versus-oneâ€ approach, which predicts the purchasing behavior of consumers. The monthly income, occupation, and knowledge of a consumer toward wine, the origin of wine, the vintage, and advertisement, are critical factors in driving consumption. Wine color and packing emerge as leading factors when consumer purchase wine for gift and banquet. Promotion significantly contributes to wine price selection for banquet, party, and self-drinking. Results show that the importance ranking of determinants varies under different purchasing motivations. In addition, the recognition accuracy can be considerably increased with prior knowledge of the consumption purpose. The nonlinear classifier is recommended for application because this classifier performs better than the linear one. This paper offers a fresh perspective on wine consumption behavior in China by applying two machine learning methods to identify and quantify determinants in specific situations. The results significantly assist wine managers to provide informed decisions with regard to wine production and marketing.",2018,Italian Journal of Food Science

Breastfeeding and popular aetiology in the Sahel.,"views about breastfeeding and the resumption of intercourse after a birth are found to prevail in Bamako and Bobo-Dioulasso, two cities of the Sahel region of Africa: that sexual relations may spoil the milk; and that a child should be weaned when the woman is pregnant again. Both beliefs provide a rationale to abstain, but the postpartum taboo has been greatly reduced in the area, and the second belief is the most important. 'Bad milk' serves as an explanation for many of the diarrhoeas and diseases of nutritional origin that affect infants and children. Traditional medical treatments of diarrhoea and protein calorie malnutrition are consistent with the popular aetiology. The acceptance of modern techniques of infant care in this area may well be predicated on the diffusion of an alternative model of disease causation. All populations of sub-Saharan Africa share a concern for the proper spacing of births. In one way or another, the ultimate goal of parents in spacing is to ensure the health of their children. They see particular dangers in pregnancies that are following too closely upon one another. Women are fearful of becoming pregnant too soon because they feel that some harm might be caused to the prior or subsequent child, and public opinion encourages them in delaying the next child. The main alleged victims of close spacing are not the mother or the foetus, as would be the case in the 'maternal depletion syndrome' of Western demographic literature; the child already born is the one perceived to be at special risk. Several related mechanisms are invoked, which are in part responsible for the taboo on intercourse and the norm of prolonged abstinence after a birth that characterize much of Africa. These include two distinct beliefs linked with breastfeeding: 'poisoning of the milk' by intercourse, and the notion that a new pregnancy will cause the mother's milk to turn bad.",1991,Health transition review
The centrality of affective instability and identity in Borderline Personality Disorder: Evidence from network analysis,"We argue that the series of traits characterizing Borderline Personality Disorder samples do not weigh equally. In this regard, we believe that network approaches employed recently in Personality and Psychopathology research to provide information about the differential relationships among symptoms would be useful to test our claim. To our knowledge, this approach has never been applied to personality disorders. We applied network analysis to the nine Borderline Personality Disorder traits to explore their relationships in two samples drawn from university students and clinical populations (N = 1317 and N = 96, respectively). We used the Fused Graphical Lasso, a technique that allows estimating networks from different populations separately while considering their similarities and differences. Moreover, we examined centrality indices to determine the relative importance of each symptom in each network. The general structure of the two networks was very similar in the two samples, although some differences were detected. Results indicate the centrality of mainly affective instability, identity, and effort to avoid abandonment aspects in Borderline Personality Disorder. Results are consistent with the new DSM Alternative Model for Personality Disorders. We discuss them in terms of implications for therapy.",2017,PLoS ONE
"Extended Comparisons of Best Subset Selection, Forward Stepwise Selection, and the Lasso","In exciting new work, Bertsimas et al. (2016) showed that the classical best subset selection problem in regression modeling can be formulated as a mixed integer optimization (MIO) problem. Using recent advances in MIO algorithms, they demonstrated that best subset selection can now be solved at much larger problem sizes that what was thought possible in the statistics community. They presented empirical comparisons of best subset selection with other popular variable selection procedures, in particular, the lasso and forward stepwise selection. Surprisingly (to us), their simulations suggested that best subset selection consistently outperformed both methods in terms of prediction accuracy. Here we present an expanded set of simulations to shed more light on these comparisons. 
The summary is roughly as follows: (a) neither best subset selection nor the lasso uniformly dominate the other, with best subset selection generally performing better in high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio regimes, and the lasso better in low SNR regimes; (b) best subset selection and forward stepwise perform quite similarly throughout; (c) the relaxed lasso (actually, a simplified version of the original relaxed estimator defined in Meinshausen, 2007) is the overall winner, performing just about as well as the lasso in low SNR scenarios, and as well as best subset selection in high SNR scenarios.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Variable Selection and Prediction in High Dimensional Problems,"The aim of this thesis is to develop methods for variable selection and statistical prediction for high dimensional statistical problems. Along with proposing new and innovative procedures, this thesis also focuses on the theoretical properties of the proposed methods and establishes bounds on the statistical error of resulting estimators. The main body of the thesis is divided into three parts. In Chapter 1, a variable screening method for generalized linear models is discussed. The emphasis of the chapter is to provide a procedure to reduce the number of variables in a reliable and fast manner. Then, Chapter 2 considers the linear regression problem in high dimensions when the noise has heavy tails. To perform robust variable selection, a new method, called adaptive robust Lasso, is introduced. Finally, in Chapter 3, the subject is high dimensional classification problems. In this chapter, a robust approach for this problem is proposed and theoretical properties for this approach are established. Overall, the methods proposed in this thesis collectively attempt to solve many of the issues arising in high dimensional statistics, from screening to variable selection. In Chapter 1, we study the variable screening problem for generalized linear models. In many applications, researchers often have some prior knowledge that a certain set of variables is related to the response. In such a situation, a natural assessment on the relative importance of the other predictors is the conditional contributions of the individual predictors in presence of the known set of variables. This results in conditional sure independence screening (CSIS). We propose and study CSIS in the context of generalized linear models. For ultrahigh-dimensional statistical problems, we give conditions under which sure screening is possible and derive an upper bound on the number of selected variables. We also spell out the situation under which CSIS yields model selection consistency. In Chapter 2, we consider the heavy-tailed high dimensional linear regression problem. In the ultra-high dimensional setting, where the dimensionality can grow iii exponentially with the sample size, we investigate the model selection oracle property and establish the asymptotic normality of a quantile regression based method called WR-Lasso. We show that only mild conditions on the model error distribution are needed. Our theoretical results also reveal that adaptive choice of the weight vector is essential for the WR-Lasso to enjoy these nice asymptotic properties. To make the WR-Lasso practically feasible, we propose a two-step procedure, called adaptive robust Lasso (AR-Lasso), in which the weight vector in the second step is constructed based on the L1-penalized quantile regression estimate from the first step. In Chapter 3, we provide an analysis about the issue of measurement errors in high dimensional linear classification problems. For such settings, we propose a new estimator called the robust sparse linear discriminant, that recovers the sparsity signal and adapts to the unknown noise level simultaneously. In contrast to the existing methods, we show that this new method has low risk properties even in the case of measurement errors. Moreover, we propose a new algorithm that recovers the solution paths for a continuum of regularization parameter values.",2013,
"Amaranthus Ã— romanus (Amaranthaceae), a new hybrid from Italy","As part of the studies on Amaranthaceae Juss. (e.g. Iamonico 2014, 2015, Sanchez Del Pino & Iamonico 2016), and the preparation of the new Checklist of the Italian vascular alien Flora (Galasso et al. 2016), I present here a note on an Amaranthus hybrid which was reported for Italy by Cacciato (1966) as â€œ Amaranthus Ã— galii Sennen & Gonzaloâ€ (Sennen 1929: 34). This name was proposed by Sennen & Gonzalo (l.c.) without a diagnosis, and it is a nomen nudum and invalid under Art. 38.1 of the ICN (McNeill et al. 2012). Furthermore, Sennen & Gonzalo in Sennen (1929: 34) cited Amaranthus patulus Bertoloni (1837: 19) and A. retroflexus Linnaeus (1753: 991) as parental taxa of the new hybrid. According to the current knowledge (see Iamonico 2016), A. patulus is a heterotypic synonym of A. hybridus Linnaeus (1753: 990). Consequently, the hybrid concept of Sennen & Gonzalo refers to A. Ã— ozanonii (Thellung 1914: 263) Schuster & Goldschmidt in Ascherson & Graebner 1920: 20) (= A. hybridus Ã— A. retroflexus ).",2017,Phytotaxa
Group Sparse Additive Models,"We consider the problem of sparse variable selection in nonparametric additive models, with the prior knowledge of the structure among the covariates to encourage those variables within a group to be selected jointly. Previous works either study the group sparsity in the parametric setting (e.g., group lasso), or address the problem in the nonparametric setting without exploiting the structural information (e.g., sparse additive models). In this paper, we present a new method, called group sparse additive models (GroupSpAM), which can handle group sparsity in additive models. We generalize the â„“1/â„“2 norm to Hilbert spaces as the sparsity-inducing penalty in GroupSpAM. Moreover, we derive a novel thresholding condition for identifying the functional sparsity at the group level, and propose an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm for constructing the estimate. We demonstrate by simulation that GroupSpAM substantially outperforms the competing methods in terms of support recovery and prediction accuracy in additive models, and also conduct a comparative experiment on a real breast cancer dataset.",2012,Proceedings of the ...

On the impact of model selection on predictor identification and parameter inference,"We assessed the ability of several penalized regression methods for linear and logistic models to identify outcome-associated predictors and the impact of predictor selection on parameter inference for practical sample sizes. We studied effect estimates obtained directly from penalized methods (Algorithm 1), or by refitting selected predictors with standard regression (Algorithm 2). For linear models, penalized linear regression, elastic net, smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), least angle regression and LASSO had a low false negative (FN) predictor selection rates but false positive (FP) rates above 20Â % for all sample and effect sizes. Partial least squares regression had few FPs but many FNs. Only relaxo had low FP and FN rates. For logistic models, LASSO and penalized logistic regression had many FPs and few FNs for all sample and effect sizes. SCAD and adaptive logistic regression had low or moderate FP rates but many FNs. 95Â % confidence interval coverage of predictors with null effects was approximately 100Â % for Algorithm 1 for all methods, and 95Â % for Algorithm 2 for large sample and effect sizes. Coverage was low only for penalized partial least squares (linear regression). For outcome-associated predictors, coverage was close to 95Â % for Algorithm 2 for large sample and effect sizes for all methods except penalized partial least squares and penalized logistic regression. Coverage was sub-nominal for Algorithm 1. In conclusion, many methods performed comparably, and while Algorithm 2 is preferred to Algorithm 1 for estimation, it yields valid inference only for large effect and sample sizes.",2017,Computational Statistics

Lundbeck A/S, Biostatistics, Valby, Denmark; 4H. Lundbeck A/S, Clinical Pharmacology, Valby, Denmark; 5University of Copenhagen, Center for Healthy Ageing, Copenhagen, Denmark Question: Will unsupervised modelling of sleep EOG and sleep EEG reveal sleep characteristica indicative of pre-Parkinson and Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD)? Methods: Polysomnographic (PSG) data from 10 age-matched control subjects were used to develop an EOG sleep model and an EEG sleep model. The sleep models were applied on full-night PSG data from 24 additional control subjects, 26 patients with periodic leg movements (PLM), 31 patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and 36 PD patients. Based on the data-driven sleep models, features reflecting sleep characteristics in the EEG and EOG activity were computed. The total amount of data was devided in a training dataset containing 16 subjects from each of the four groups, and a validation dataset containing the remaining subjects. The features derived were evaluated and the most discriminative ones between iRBD/PD (neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) cases) and PLM/controls (motor, but non-NDD cases) were found by training a Lasso regularized Regression model using eight-fold cross-validation on the training dataset. Results: The best classification model included four features derived from the EEG data, and the NDD patients in the validation dataset could be classified with a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 61.1%. The most discriminative features were found to be thresholded amounts and stability of EEG topics reflected to REM, N3 and N1/N2, respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests that the amount of N3 and R and the ability to maintain NREM and REM sleep determined by a data-driven sleep model can be used as potentially early PD biomarkers. P1048 Increased amount of reported total sleep time during 24 hours is related to the severity of sleep disturbances in ischemic stroke patients A. Holm1, M. Vaelimaeki1, T.-M. Haula2, S. Leskelae2, E. Rauhala1 1Satakunta Central Hospital, Clinical Neurophysiology, Pori, Finland; 2Satakunta Central Hospital, Neurology, Pori, Finland Question: Are self-reported short and long term sleep quality related to the severity of sleep related breathing disturbances (SRBD) in ischemic stroke patients? Methods: In this pilot study, 23 patients with acute first-time stroke, admitted to the stroke unit, underwent overnight polygraphy during the first 72 h after admission. Nasal airflow, respiratory movements, snoring sound, oxygenation level, and ECG were recorded. The incidence of SRBD before the stroke was studied with a questionnaire regarding their sleep three months prior the stroke. The reported quality of sleep during the treatment period in stroke unit was examined with the visual scale questionnaire containing five questions. The severity of stroke was assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the ability to function with the Barthel Index. Results: Increased apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was related to the increased amount of total sleep time during 24 hours (p=0.006). No association was found between AHI and the amount of sleep time during night. Also, no correlations between AHI and VAS questions were found. Increased AHI was related with lower Barthel Index (p=0.017) but not with NIHSS. Conclusions: SRBD as well as excessive daytime sleepiness are common findings in patients after stroke. In our study, stroke patients with increased AHI reported increased amount of sleep time during 24 h but not during night time regarding three months pre-stroke, suggesting that they are napping. SRBD negatively affect to the functional outcome after stroke. In addition, SRBD increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, which in turn increases risk for stroke. It is suggested that early diagnosis and treatment of underlying SRBD improve both recovery from stroke in short term and reduce the risk of relapses in long term. Our preliminary results suggest that reported napping may be a marker for a potential SRBD in stroke patients. P1049 Non-REM sleep microstructures and phasic REM sleep events are associated with intracranial oxygenation changes measured with NIRS J. Toppila1, T. Naesi2, J. Virtanen2, T. Salmi1, R. Ilmoniemi2 1Helsinki University Hospital, Medical Imaging/Clin. Neurophys., Helsinki, Finland; 2Aalto University, BECS, Espoo, Finland Question: Disordered and fragmented sleep due to sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and insomnia are associated with an increased risk of cardioand cerebrovascular morbidity. Autonomic activation and repetitive hypoxia are examples of possible mechanisms mediating this risk. In addition to sleep apnea episodes, non-apneic disruptions in sleep continuity are associated with transitory intracranial hypoxia measured with nearinfrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Some of the K-complexes are triggered by non-waking external auditory stimuli. Phasic rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep is associated with the activation of the autonomic nervous system and surges in systemic blood pressure. Are these sleep microstructural phenomena associated with changes in intracranial blood oxygenation? Methods: Six healthy volunteers were measured overnight with polysomnography and NIRS for extraand intracranial blood oxygenation changes. Sleep spindles, K-complexes, and bursts of eye movements in REM sleep were detected. Average temporal changes in oxyand deoxyhemoglobin triggered by these sleep events were measured. Results: K-complexes triggered short intracranial hemodynamic responses and spindels delayed and longer responses. During and after phasic events in REM sleep, there were transient changes in intracranial blood oxygenation. Conclusions: K-complexes are associated with transient hemodynamic changes in intracranial circulation, which can mediate harmful vascular effects during poor sleep due to noisy environments. Systemic blood pressure surges during phasic REM sleep are counteracted with vasoconstriction in cerebral arteries, leading to transient cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxia episodes during REM sleep. This could be associated with an increased risk of stroke during early mornings. P1050 Neurophysiological testing of the upper airway in obstructive sleep apnea showing peripheral nervous lesions E.

Chapter 9 â€“ Sparsity-Aware Learning: Concepts and Theoretical Foundations,This chapter presents the main concepts and theoretical foundations related to sparsity-aware learning techniques. The concept of sparse modeling is introduced together with the LASSO and the l0 and l1 norm minimizing tasks. Conditions for uniqueness of the obtained solutions as well as for the equivalence of the l0 and l1 norm minimization are stated. The RIP condition and related bounds are discussed. Compressed sensing and the notion of stable embeddings are reviewed. The concept of sub-Nyquist sampling is presented and finally a case study concerning image de-nosing is reported.,2015,
An immune infiltration signature to predict the overall survival of patients with colon cancer.,"Immune infiltration of tumors has been increasingly accepted as a prognostic factor in colon cancer. Here, we aim to develop a novel immune signature, based on estimated immune landscape from tumor transcriptomes, to predict the overall survival of patients with colon cancer. The compositions of 22 immune cell subtypes from three microarray datasets were characterized with the CIBERSORT deconvolution algorithm. A prognostic immunoscore (PIS) model for overall survival prediction was established by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized regression analysis. A total of 17 immune cell markers were screened out in the LASSO model and were then aggregated to generate the PIS. In the training cohort (n =â€‰490), patients with high PIS exhibited a remarkably poorer overall survival than those with low PIS. Similar results were obtained in patients with different TNM stages and in patients receiving adjunctive chemotherapy or not. Multivariate Cox regression indicated that the PIS was an independent predictor for overall survival in colon cancer (hazard ratio: 2.734, 95% confidence interval: 2.052-3.643, p <â€‰.001). The prognostic capability of PIS was also confirmed in the testing cohort (n =â€‰245) and the entire cohort (n =â€‰735). As for biological implications, the PIS was significantly associated with some immune checkpoints, inflammatory factors, epithelial-mesenchymal transformation regulators, and many known signaling pathways in cancer. The results of our study provide a novel and promising immune signature for overall survival prediction of patients with colon cancer.",2019,IUBMB life
Avoiding pitfalls in L1-regularised inference of gene networks.,"Statistical regularisation methods such as LASSO and related L1 regularised regression methods are commonly used to construct models of gene regulatory networks. Although they can theoretically infer the correct network structure, they have been shown in practice to make errors, i.e. leave out existing links and include non-existing links. We show that L1 regularisation methods typically produce a poor network model when the analysed data are ill-conditioned, i.e. the gene expression data matrix has a high condition number, even if it contains enough information for correct network inference. However, the correct structure of network models can be obtained for informative data, data with such a signal to noise ratio that existing links can be proven to exist, when these methods fail, by using least-squares regression and setting small parameters to zero, or by using robust network inference, a recent method taking the intersection of all non-rejectable models. Since available experimental data sets are generally ill-conditioned, we recommend to check the condition number of the data matrix to avoid this pitfall of L1 regularised inference, and to also consider alternative methods.",2015,Molecular bioSystems
Sub-optimality of some continuous shrinkage priors,"Two-component mixture priors provide a traditional way to induce sparsity in high-dimensional Bayes models. However, several aspects of such a prior, including computational complexities in high-dimensions, interpretation of exact zeros and non-sparse posterior summaries under standard loss functions, has motivated an amazing variety of continuous shrinkage priors, which can be expressed as global-local scale mixtures of Gaussians. Interestingly, we demonstrate that many commonly used shrinkage priors, including the Bayesian Lasso, do not have adequate posterior concentration in high-dimensional settings.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Modeling Gene Regulatory Networks from Time Series Data using Particle Filtering,"Modeling Gene Regulatory Networks from Time Series Data Using Particle Filtering. (August 2011) Amina Noor, B.E., M.S., National University of Sciences and Technology Coâ€“Chairs of Advisory Committee: Dr. Erchin Serpedin Dr. Mohamed Nounou This thesis considers the problem of learning the structure of gene regulatory networks using gene expression time series data. A more realistic scenario where the state space model representing a gene network evolves nonlinearly is considered while a linear model is assumed for the microarray data. To capture the nonlinearity, a particle filter based state estimation algorithm is studied instead of the contemporary linear approximation based approaches. The parameters signifying the regulatory relations among various genes are estimated online using a Kalman filter. Since a particular gene interacts with a few other genes only, the parameter vector is expected to be sparse. The state estimates delivered by the particle filter and the observed microarray data are then fed to a LASSO based least squares regression operation, which yields a parsimonious and efficient description of the regulatory network by setting the irrelevant coefficients to zero. The performance of the aforementioned algorithm is compared with extended Kalman filtering (EKF), employing Mean Square Error as the fidelity criterion using synthetic data and real biological data. Extensive computer simulations illustrate that the particle filter based gene network inference algorithm outperforms EKF and therefore, it can serve as a natural framework for modeling gene regulatory networks.",2012,
