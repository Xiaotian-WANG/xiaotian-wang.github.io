Stagewise generalized estimating equations with grouped variables.,"Forward stagewise estimation is a revived slow-brewing approach for model building that is particularly attractive in dealing with complex data structures for both its computational efficiency and its intrinsic connections with penalized estimation. Under the framework of generalized estimating equations, we study general stagewise estimation approaches that can handle clustered data and non-Gaussian/non-linear models in the presence of prior variable grouping structure. As the grouping structure is often not ideal in that even the important groups may contain irrelevant variables, the key is to simultaneously conduct group selection and within-group variable selection, that is, bi-level selection. We propose two approaches to address the challenge. The first is a bi-level stagewise estimating equations (BiSEE) approach, which is shown to correspond to the sparse group lasso penalized regression. The second is a hierarchical stagewise estimating equations (HiSEE) approach to handle more general hierarchical grouping structure, in which each stagewise estimation step itself is executed as a hierarchical selection process based on the grouping structure. Simulation studies show that BiSEE and HiSEE yield competitive model selection and predictive performance compared to existing approaches. We apply the proposed approaches to study the association between the suicide-related hospitalization rates of the 15-19 age group and the characteristics of the school districts in the State of Connecticut.",2017,Biometrics

The cyclical behavior of separation and job finding rates in Colombia,"This work uses readily accessible data about the stocks of unemployed workers, labor force and duration of unemployment to measure the job finding and separation rates for Colombia from 1984 to 2014. It also evaluates the relative contribution of these rates to the fluctuations of unemployment rate. It is found that contemporaneous movements in both rates explain significantly and in roughly the same proportion the changes in the unemployment rate during the analyzed period; however, for the last seven years job finding rate has driven the unemployment fluctuations. The results of this work differ from previous findings by Lasso (2011) where the separation rate is the most important in Colombia. Results are contrasted with the obtained for France and United States to show that Colombian unemployment is of European nature but has United Statesâ€™ features.",2015,
Learning a nonlinear gene regulation model from perturbed steady-state data,"Biological structure and function depend on complex regulatory interactions between many genes. A wealth of gene expression data is available from high-throughput genome-wide measurement technologies, but effective gene regulatory network inference methods are still needed. Model-based methods founded on quantitative descriptions of gene regulation are among the most promising, but many such methods still rely on ad hoc inference approaches and lack experimental interpretability. We propose an experimental design and develop an associated statistical method for learning a quantitative, interpretable, predictive, biophysics-based ordinary differential equation model for gene regulation. We fit the model parameters using gene expression measurements from perturbed steady-states of the system, like those following overexpression or knockdown experiments. Although the original model is nonlinear, our design allows us to transform it into a convex optimization problem by restricting attention to steady-states and using the lasso for parameter selection. Here, we describe the model and inference algorithm and apply them to a synthetic six-gene system, demonstrating that the model is detailed and flexible enough to account for activation and repression as well as synergistic and self-regulation, and that the algorithm can efficiently and accurately recover the parameters used to generate the data.",2012,arXiv: Molecular Networks
Asymptotic theory of the adaptive Sparse Group Lasso,"We study the asymptotic properties of a new version of the Sparse Group Lasso estimator (SGL), called adaptive SGL. This new version includes two distinct regularization parameters, one for the Lasso penalty and one for the Group Lasso penalty, and we consider the adaptive version of this regularization, where both penalties are weighted by preliminary random coefficients. The asymptotic properties are established in a general framework, where the data are dependent and the loss function is convex. We prove that this estimator satisfies the oracle property: the sparsity-based estimator recovers the true underlying sparse model and is asymptotically normally distributed. We also study its asymptotic properties in a double-asymptotic framework, where the number of parameters diverges with the sample size. We show by simulations and on real data that the adaptive SGL outperforms other oracle-like methods in terms of estimation precision and variable selection.",2018,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics

TU-CD-BRB-01: Normal Lung CT Texture Features Improve Predictive Models for Radiation Pneumonitis,"Purpose: Existing normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models for radiation pneumonitis (RP) traditionally rely on dosimetric and clinical data but are limited in terms of performance and generalizability. Extraction of pre-treatment image features provides a potential new category of data that can improve NTCP models for RP. We consider quantitative measures of total lung CT intensity and texture in a framework for prediction of RP. Methods: Available clinical and dosimetric data was collected for 198 NSCLC patients treated with definitive radiotherapy. Intensity- and texture-based image features were extracted from the T50 phase of the 4D-CT acquired for treatment planning. A total of 3888 features (15 clinical, 175 dosimetric, and 3698 image features) were gathered and considered candidate predictors for modeling of RP gradeâ‰¥3. A baseline logistic regression model with mean lung dose (MLD) was first considered. Additionally, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was applied to the set of clinical and dosimetric features, and subsequently to the full set of clinical, dosimetric, and image features. Model performance was assessed by comparing area under the curve (AUC). Results: A simple logistic fit of MLD was an inadequate model of the data (AUCâˆ¼0.5). Including clinical and dosimetric parameters within the framework of the LASSO resulted in improved performance (AUC=0.648). Analysis of the full cohort of clinical, dosimetric, and image features provided further and significant improvement in model performance (AUC=0.727). Conclusions: To achieve significant gains in predictive modeling of RP, new categories of data should be considered in addition to clinical and dosimetric features. We have successfully incorporated CT image features into a framework for modeling RP and have demonstrated improved predictive performance. Validation and further investigation of CT image features in the context of RP NTCP modeling is warranted. This work was supported by the Rosalie B.

New cases of mimicry in marine fishes,"Ten new cases of mimicry in marine fishes are described. Juveniles of Lutjanus bohar (Lutjanidae) appear to be aggressive mimics of the damsel fish Chromis ternatensis (Poma-centridae). Both species occur together throughout the Indo-Pacific. At Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, juveniles ofAnyperodon leucogrammicus similarly appear to be aggressive mimics of the wrasse Halichoeres biocellatus (Labridae). At One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef, juveniles of Scolopsis bilinealus (Scolopsidae) enter into a Batesian mimic ring with Meiacanthus lineatus (Blenniidae) and an undescribed species of Petroscirtes (Blenniidae). In Fiji, S. bilineatus enters into a mimic complex with Meiacanthus atrodorsalis oualanensis and Plagiotremus laudandus (Blenniidae). At Madang, New Guinea, Scolopsis margaritifer juveniles and Cheilodipteris zonatus (Apogonidae) appear to be Batesian mimics of an undescribed species of Meiacanthus. In Samoa, Aspidontus taeniatus (Blenniidae) appears to be an aggressive mimic of a new species of Labroides (Labridae). In New Britain an unusual orange colour morph of the sabre-tooth blenny Plagiotremus rhynorhynchos appears to aggressively mimic Anthias mortoni (Anthiidae) with which it associates. The sabre-tooth blenny Plagiotremus tapeinosoma loosely associates with different species over its range of distribution. On the Great Barrier Reef and at Norfolk Island, it swims among aggregations of Thalassoma amblycephalus (Labridae); in south-eastern Australia it enters into a similar loose mimetic relationship with aggregations of Trachinops taeniatus (Plesiopidae); and in north-eastern New Zealand, it associates with an undescribed, free-swimming species of Forsterygion (Tripterygiidae). Mimicry amongst marine fishes appears to be a general and widespread phenomenon. Present examples suggest that there may be varying degrees of resemblance; in some cases the mimic-model relationship is loose and facultative while in others it appears to be highly co-evolved and obligative.",2009,Journal of Zoology
Review of the Toadfish Genera (Teleostei: Batrachoididae),"The family Batrachoididae is represented by 25 genera and 78 species occurring worldwide between about 51Â°N and 45Â°S along continents in marine and brackish waters, occasionally entering rivers, with several freshwater species in South America. They have limited dispersal ability because they have demersal eggs and lack pelagic larvae. A phylogenetic analysis using Paup with 50 informative characters and Draconetta, Ogilbia, Raniceps, and Synchiropus as outgroups, resulted in the recognition of two major clades, New World and Old World. The subfamilies Porichthyinae and Thalassophryninae are retained; however the subfamily Batrachoidinae is restricted to the New World and a new subfamily, Halophryninae, is recognized for the Old World genera. Triathalassothia, which occurs in southeastern South America, is regarded as incertae sedis being either basal to the New World or Old World clade. There is close correspondence between various recognized clades and their geographic locations. Batrichthys felinus Smith is removed to Chatrabus. The family Batrachoididae is the only family in the order Batrachoidiformes (Haplodoci). These small to medium-sized fishes (to 57 cm) are easily recognized by their characteristic shape, with a large, broad, flattened head, often with barbels and/or fleshy flaps around their large mouths, and a tapering body. The eyes are on top of the head and directed upwards. Moderately strong teeth are present in the jaws and on the roof of the mouth. Spines are present on the opercle and often the subopercle. There are two separate dorsal fins, the first with two or three spines, and the second long with up to 40 soft rays. The anal fin is somewhat shorter than the second dorsal with up to 39 rays. The pectoral fins are large and broad based and the pelvic fins are jugular in position with one spine and three soft rays. Glandular tissue may be present in the opercular region and pectoral-fin axil or between the pectoral-fin rays. The skin may be scaly or naked. The lateralis system is very well developed, with either single or multiple lateral lines, each pore usually surrounded by two tentacles. Gill openings are usually, but not always, small and restricted to the sides of the body. The number of vertebrae ranges from 25 to 47. The swimbladder is well developed, and used for sound production in many species. Species of Porichthys have photophores along their sides and ventral surface. Species in the subfamily Thalassophryninae have hollow, venomous spines in their first dorsal fin and opercles. Bifax lacinia has a flap with an eye spot at the end of the maxilla on each side of the mouth. Toadfishes usually are rather drab colored, often brownish with darker saddles, bars, or spots; however, some species in the Atlantic genus Sanopus are bright",2008,
Lasso model selection in multi-dimensional contingency tables?,"We develop a Smooth Lasso for sparse, high dimensional, contingency tables and compare its performance with the usual Lasso and with the now classical backwards elimination algorithm. In simulation, the usual Lasso had great difficulty identifying the correct model. Irrespective of the sample size, it did not succeed in identifying the correct model in the simulation study! By comparison the smooth Lasso performed better improving with increasing sample size. The backwards elimination algorithm also performed well and was better than the Smooth Lasso at small sample sizes. Another potential difficulty is that Lasso methods do not respect the marginal constraints on hierarchy and so lead to non-hierarchical models which are unscientific. Furthermore, even when one can demonstrate, classically, that some effects in the model are inestimable, the Lasso methods provide penalized estimates. These problems call Lasso methods into question.",2016,
The establishment and evaluation of a new model for the prediction of Children B-ALL based on TARGET: A SQUIRE-compliant study.,"B lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) is a hematopoietic malignant disease characterized by an accumulation of early B cells. This study aimed to construct a children B-ALL Nomogram prediction model based on Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments database, so as to further guide clinical diagnose and treatment.Clinical data related to children B-ALL were collected from the TARGET database, among which, the stage II clinical data were used as the prediction model, while the stage I clinical data were utilized as the external verification model. The stage II clinical factors were analyzed through Lasso regression analysis to screen the risk factors for the construction of Nomogram prediction model. In addition, the model prediction capacity and accuracy were verified internally and externally using the ROC curve, C-index and calibration curve, respectively.A total of 1316 B-ALL children were enrolled in this study. Lasso regression analysis revealed that, Age, Gender, WBC, CNSL, MRD29, BMR, CNS R, BCR-ABL1, BMA29, DS, and DI were the important prognostic risk factors. The C-index values of internal and external verification models were 0.870 and 0.827, respectively, revealing the ideal model discriminating capacity. Besides, the calibration curve had high contact ratio, which suggested favorable consistency between the incidence predicted by the model and the actual incidence. Moreover, the AUC values of the ROC curve were 0.858, 0.787, 0.898, and 0.867, respectively, indicating high model prediction accuracy in predicting the 3- and 5-year survival rates of children with B-ALL.The Nomogram prediction model plotted in this study exhibits favorable prediction capacity and clinical practicability for the survival rate of B-ALL children, which contributes to patients screening and clinical intervention.",2020,Medicine
Model selection methods for genome wide association studies and statistical analysis of RNA seq data,"Due to the multiple loci control nature of complex phenotypes, there is great interest to test markers simultaneously instead of one by one. In this paper, we compare three model selection methods for genome wide association studies using simulations: the Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS), the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the Elastic Net. We also apply the three methods to identify genetic variants that are associated with daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. The simulation studies were performed by using the genotype data of 60 unrelated individuals from the CEU population in the Hapmap project. For the cytotoxicity data, we used 3,967,790 markers across the whole genome for 56 unrelated individuals from the CEU population. Using Sure Independence Screening as the pre-screening procedure, the SSVS gives a small model while the LASSO gives an intermediate sized model and the Elastic Net provides a large model. The three models share many common markers although the model sizes are different. The model sizes are subject to various cutoffs and parameters. The SSVS outperforms the LASSO and the Elastic Net in simulation studies. We also demonstrate the ability of the SSVS, the LASSO, and the Elastic Net to handle the situation when the number of markers is larger than the number of samples.",2012,
Cross-Predictability of Industry Return in Trade Network: Using LASSO,"This study tests the predictability power of returns across economically related industries, using monthly data over 1990â€“2010 and a machine learning model, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). This article presents evidence that LASSO identifies significant predictors of the returns of an individual industry among its interdependent industries. The results indicate cross-predictability of industry return by showing a significant relation between an industryâ€™s returns and the lagged returns of its LASSO-selected trade partners. The study finds that industries that are more central in the input-output network have a greater effect in predicting related industry return. It also computes out of sample (2011â€“2016) the mean return forecasts of the portfolio of industries based on the predictability effect of the lagged returns of trade partners. The self-financing trading strategy of buying (selling) a high (low) portfolio based on related industry lagged returns yields about 10.44 percent annual excess return (0.83 percent monthly), with an annual Sharpe ratio of about 0.86. The study shows that after controlling for the Fama-French (1993) three factors, the monthly returns from the self-financing trading strategies generate a significant alpha of 0.7 percent monthly over the period 2011â€“2016.

Comparison of Cold Tolerance Within 6 Cultivars of Iris germanica,"The relative electric conductivity(REC)and field inspection were determined in leaves of six cultivars of Iris germanica during the natural winter along with dropping temperature. The logistic equation was constructed based on the relationship between REC and temperature,then the semi-lethal temperature was determined. Malondialdehyde(MDA)contents,soluble protein contents and free proline contents were analyzed. The results showed that the index of chilling injury was intervenient 1.20 and 3.65,and the range of semi-lethal temperature(LT 50)was from-13.81 â„ƒ to-5.73 â„ƒ. 'Cherry Falls' and'Bedtime Story' had high cold tolerance. 'Brown Lasso' and'Black Swan' had medium cold tolerance. 'China Dragon' and'Caligula' had poor cold tolerance.

Local Linear Convergence of Forward-Backward under Partial Smoothness,"In this paper, we consider the Forward-Backward proximal splitting algorithm to minimize the sum of two proper closed convex functions, one of which having a Lipschitz continuous gradient and the other being partly smooth relative to an active manifold M. We propose a generic framework under which we show that the Forward-Backward (i) correctly identifies the active manifold M in a finite number of iterations, and then (ii) enters a local linear convergence regime that we characterize precisely. This gives a grounded and unified explanation to the typical behaviour that has been observed numerically for many problems encompassed in our framework, including the Lasso, the group Lasso, the fused Lasso and the nuclear norm regularization to name a few. These results may have numerous applications including in signal/image processing processing, sparse recovery and machine learning.",2014,

Thalassotherapy and health tourism in Crikvenica: origins and development,"Thalassotherapy and health tourism of Crikvenica date back to the opening of the first public beach in 1888. Favoured by the Archduke Joseph von Hapsburg, Crikvenica soon won over considerable Hungarian capital, invested in hotels and boarding houses. The first hotel was Archduke Joseph, renamed in 1900 to Therapia, followed by hotel Miramar and army resort Militar Kurhaus, which moved to a new Villa Mira in 1897. In 1898, the Archdukeâ€™s wife Clotilda set up a Ladislausâ€™ Childrenâ€™s Home for paediatric treatment and recovery in St. Paulâ€™s monastery. In 1908, Dr Oskar Seidl set up a sanatorium Dr Oskar Seidlâ€™s Home. 1913 saw the opening of Villa RuÅ¾ica, which was a sanatorium for Croatian teachers. In 1909, Marija Steyskalova established a sanatorium for over 400 Czech children. Shortly before the break of the Great War, another sanatorium (and resort) saw the light of day â€“ Pecic â€“ Odilon. At one point, there were eight sanatoriums/health resorts in function. No wonder then that, in 1906, Crikvenica received the official title â€œSeaside resort and climate therapy resortâ€ from the nationâ€™s government. This recognition boosted the townâ€™s progress.",2006,
Instrumental Variable Estimation and Selection with Many Weak and Irrelevant Instruments,"This paper proposes a new two stage least squares (2SLS) estimator which is consistent and asymptotically normal in the presence of many weak and irrelevant instruments and heteroskedasticity. In the first stage the estimator uses an adaptive absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) that selects the relevant instruments with high probability. However, the adaptive LASSO estimates have a considerable bias. To address this concern and exploit the instrument selection properties of the adaptive LASSO, an OLS regression with the selected instruments is performed in the first stage. The first stage can be constructed using the assumption of mean independence between the instruments and the structural random disturbance. This allows for the possibility of a nonparametric adaptive LASSO in the first stage. The second stage uses an OLS regression with the fitted values of the first stage. Simulation results suggest that the proposed methodology has better performance than the existing estimators when the levels of endogeneity and instrument weakness are high.",2012,
Weighted Thresholding and Nonlinear Approximation,"We present a new method for performing nonlinear approximation with redundant dictionaries. The method constructs an $m-$term approximation of the signal by thresholding with respect to a weighted version of its canonical expansion coefficients, thereby accounting for dependency between the coefficients. The main result is an associated strong Jackson embedding, which provides an upper bound on the corresponding reconstruction error. To complement the theoretical results, we compare the proposed method to the pure greedy method and the Windowed-Group Lasso by denoising music signals with elements from a Gabor dictionary.",2017,arXiv: Functional Analysis
Exploiting structured sparsity in Bayesian experimental design,"In this paper, we merge Bayesian experimental design with turbo approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms for the purpose of recovering structured-sparse signals using a multi-step adaptive compressive-measurement procedure. First, we show that, when the signal posterior is Gaussian, a waterfilling approach can be used to adapt the measurement matrix in a way that expected information gain is maximized. Next, we propose four methods of approximating AMP's non-Gaussian marginal posteriors by a Gaussian joint posterior. One of these methods requires only point estimates of the signal, and leads to a novel kernel adaptation scheme that works even with non-Bayesian signal recovery algorithms like LASSO. Finally, we demonstrate (empirically) that our adaptive turbo AMP yields estimation performance very close to the support-oracle bound.1",2011,2011 4th IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)
[Susceptibility of Anopheles gambiae to insecticides in the Ivory Coast].,Studies on the susceptibility of Anopheles gambiae to insecticides were carried out in rice field areas of CÃ´te-d'Ivoire. An. gambiae larvae populations from CÃ´te-d'Ivoire were resistant to DDT but susceptible to organophosphorous insecticides. Adult populations from the surroundings of Bouake were resistant to DDT and permethrin. Resistance to propoxur was strongly suspected. The knock-down effect of both deltamethrin and lambdacyhalothrin was delayed and strongly decreased. The control strain from Bobo-Dioulasso and populations from rice fields of Katiola located far from the city were still susceptible to the three pyrethroids. It is likely that resistance to pyrethroids in Bouake has been promoted by the intensive use of domestic aerosol sprays.,1994,Sante
Penalized differential pathway analysis of integrative oncogenomics studies,"Abstract Through integration of genomic data from multiple sources, we may obtain a more accurate and complete picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. We discuss the integration of DNA copy number and mRNA gene expression data from an observational integrative genomics study involving cancer patients. The two molecular levels involved are linked through the central dogma of molecular biology. DNA copy number aberrations abound in the cancer cell. Here we investigate how these aberrations affect gene expression levels within a pathway using observational integrative genomics data of cancer patients. In particular, we aim to identify differential edges between regulatory networks of two groups involving these molecular levels. Motivated by the rate equations, the regulatory mechanism between DNA copy number aberrations and gene expression levels within a pathway is modeled by a simultaneous-equations model, for the one- and two-group case. The latter facilitates the identification of differential interactions between the two groups. Model parameters are estimated by penalized least squares using the lasso (L1) penalty to obtain a sparse pathway topology. Simulations show that the inclusion of DNA copy number data benefits the discovery of gene-gene interactions. In addition, the simulations reveal that cis-effects tend to be over-estimated in a univariate (single gene) analysis. In the application to real data from integrative oncogenomic studies we show that inclusion of prior information on the regulatory network architecture benefits the reproducibility of all edges. Furthermore, analyses of the TP53 and TGFb signaling pathways between ER+ and ER- samples from an integrative genomics breast cancer study identify reproducible differential regulatory patterns that corroborate with existing literature.",2014,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
Engineering the Future: A Conceptual Framework for Evolving Engineering Education,"Today, we live in a world of unprecedented challenges, opportunities, and complexities, where advances in technology are transforming the very fabric of our culture, economy, and environment.

Feature selection for surrogate model-based optimization,We propose a hybridization approach called Regularized-Surrogate-Optimization (RSO) aimed at overcoming difficulties related to high-dimensionality. It combines standard Kriging-based SMBO with regularization techniques. The employed regularization methods use the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). An extensive study is performed on a set of artificial test functions and two real-world applications: the electrostatic precipitator problem and a multilayered composite design problem.

Schwermineralvergesellschaftungen aus ostalpinen Sedimentationsbecken der Kreidezeit,"ZusammenfassungIn den Kreide- und AlttertiÃ¤rablagerungen aus verschiedenen geologischen Einheiten der Ostalpen sind mindestens drei Provinzen mit unterschiedlichen Schwermineralassoziationen voneinander abzutrennen:1.Im Helvetikum und in den tieferen penninischen Einheiten ist Zirkon mit wechselnden Mengen von Rutil, Turmalin und Apatit anzutreffen.2.Der penninische Flysch in Ã–sterreich fÃ¼hrt in der Oberkreide zusÃ¤tzlich zu den erwÃ¤hnten Mineralen noch Granat, also Komponenten aus metamorphen Gesteinen.3.Die oberostalpinen Kreideablagerungen auf den nÃ¶rdlichen Kalkalpen und der zwischen Flysch und Kalkalpen eingeschaltete Sedimentationsraum haben von der Unterkreide bis ins Untercampan einen Chromit-fÃ¼hrenden Detritus erhalten, der aus einem Einzugsgebiet mit basischen Gesteinen abzuleiten ist. Ab Untercampan wurde eine SandeinschÃ¼ttung mit reichlich Granat, daneben Staurolith und Chloritoid, deren Heimat metamorphe Gesteine sind, abgelagert.AbstractIn the Eastern Alps the study of heavy minerals from Cretaceous and Early Tertiary sediments enables us to distinguish at least three different provinces.1.The deposits of Helveticum and the lower parts of Penninicum contain predominantly zircon, together with varying quantities of rutile, tourmaline and apatite.2.The penninic flysch in Austria contains garnet in addition to the heavy minerals mentioned; the parent rocks of the garnet are metamorphic rocks.3.From Lower Cretaceous up to Lower Campanian the Cretaceous deposits overlying the Northern Limestones Alps are characterized by the predominance of chromite. After this time the influence of basic rocks ends and deposition of sediments containing garnet, staurolit and chloritoid (derived from metamorphic rocks) begins.RÃ©sumÃ©L'Ã©tude des minÃ©raux lourds dans les sÃ©diments crÃ©tacÃ©s et tertiaires des Alpes Orientales permet de dÃ©couvrir quelques variations dans la composition du dÃ©tritus, qui est situÃ© dans les espaces diffÃ©rents:1.Les grÃ¨s de la zone helvÃ©tique et les parties plus basses de la zone pennique sont caractÃ©risÃ©s par zircon avec rutile, tourmaline et apatite en quantitÃ©s variables.2.Pendant le CrÃ©tacÃ© supÃ©rieur le flysch de la zone pennique en Autriche a un assemblage de minÃ©raux lourds trÃ¨s riches en grenat.

Incorporating pathway information into boosting estimation of high-dimensional risk prediction models,"BackgroundThere are several techniques for fitting risk prediction models to high-dimensional data, arising from microarrays. However, the biological knowledge about relations between genes is only rarely taken into account. One recent approach incorporates pathway information, available, e.g., from the KEGG database, by augmenting the penalty term in Lasso estimation for continuous response models.ResultsAs an alternative, we extend componentwise likelihood-based boosting techniques for incorporating pathway information into a larger number of model classes, such as generalized linear models and the Cox proportional hazards model for time-to-event data. In contrast to Lasso-like approaches, no further assumptions for explicitly specifying the penalty structure are needed, as pathway information is incorporated by adapting the penalties for single microarray features in the course of the boosting steps. This is shown to result in improved prediction performance when the coefficients of connected genes have opposite sign. The properties of the fitted models resulting from this approach are then investigated in two application examples with microarray survival data.ConclusionThe proposed approach results not only in improved prediction performance but also in structurally different model fits. Incorporating pathway information in the suggested way is therefore seen to be beneficial in several ways.",2008,BMC Bioinformatics
Exploiting High-order Phase-shift Keying Modulation and Direct-detection in Silicon Photonic Systems,"A computational approach to evaluate the bit-error ratio (BER) in silicon photonic systems employing high-order phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation formats is presented. Specifically, the investigated systems contain a silicon based optical interconnect, namely a strip silicon photonic waveguide or a silicon photonic crystal waveguide, and direct-detection receivers suitable to detect PSK and amplitude-shaped PSK signals. The superposition of a PSK signal and complex additive white Gaussian noise passes through the optical interconnect and subsequently through two detection-branch receivers. To model the signal propagation in the silicon optical interconnects we used a modified nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equation, which incorporates all relevant linear and nonlinear optical effects and the mutual interaction between free-carriers and the optical field. Finally, the BER is calculated by applying a frequency-domain approach based on the Karhunen-LoÃ¨ve series expansion method. Our computational studies of the BER reveal that the optical power, type of PSK modulation, waveguide length, and group-velocity are key factors characterizing the system BER, their influence on BER being more significant in a photonic system with larger nonlinearity. In particular, our analysis shows that the system performance is affected to a much larger extent when the signal propagates in the slow-light regime, despite the fact that this regime allows for a significantly reduced length of optical interconnects.

Impact of node dynamical parameters on structures identification of complex networks based on the Lasso method,"Complex networks are ubiquitous in nature and society. The functions and features of complex networks are various when these networks have different nodal dynamics and network topologies. Reconstructing networks with high-order nodal dynamics or different system parameter vectors from limited measurable information is a fundamental problem for using and controlling these networks. Based on the Lasso method, we present an efficient and feasible, completely data-driven approach to predict the structures of complex networks in the presence or absence of noise when the systemic parameter is uncertain, that is, the node dynamical parameter vector of network can vary. The numerical simulations indicate that, networks structures can be fully reconstructed even only few information available under the conditions of the systemic parameter vector is varying and in the presence or absence of noise, this method is effective and robust.",2017,IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society
Study of the brain functional network using synthetic data,"The brain functional connectivity is usually assessed with the correlation coefficients of certain signals. The partial correlation matrix can reveal direct interactions between brain regions. However, computing this matrix is usually challenging due to the availability of only a limited number of samples. As an alternative, thresholding the sample correlation matrix is a common technique for the identification of the direct interactions. In this work, we investigate the performance of this method in addition to some other well-known techniques, namely graphical lasso and Chow-Liu algorithm. Our analysis is performed on some synthetic data produced by an electrical circuit model with certain structural properties. We show that the simple method of thresholding the correlation matrix and the graphical lasso algorithm would both create false positives and negatives that wrongly imply some network properties such as small-worldness. We also apply these techniques to some resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data and show that similar observations can be made.",2014,"2014 52nd Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)"
Condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL): An adaptive procedure for inferring condition-specific gene co-expression network,"Co-expression network analysis provides useful information for studying gene regulation in biological processes. Examining condition-specific patterns of co-expression can provide insights into the underlying cellular processes activated in a particular condition. One challenge in this type of analysis is that the sample sizes in each condition are usually small, making the statistical inference of co-expression patterns highly underpowered. A joint network construction that borrows information from related structures across conditions has the potential to improve the power of the analysis. One possible approach to constructing the co-expression network is to use the Gaussian graphical model. Though several methods are available for joint estimation of multiple graphical models, they do not fully account for the heterogeneity between samples and between co-expression patterns introduced by condition specificity. Here we develop the condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL), a data-driven approach to incorporate condition specificity in the estimation of co-expression networks. We show that this method improves the accuracy with which networks are learned. The application of this method on a rat multi-tissue dataset and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset provides interesting biological insights. In both analyses, we identify numerous modules enriched for Gene Ontology functions and observe that the modules that are upregulated in a particular condition are often involved in condition-specific activities. Interestingly, we observe that the genes strongly associated with survival time in the TCGA dataset are less likely to be network hubs, suggesting that genes associated with cancer progression are likely to govern specific functions or execute final biological functions in pathways, rather than regulating a large number of biological processes. Additionally, we observed that the tumor-specific hub genes tend to have few shared edges with normal tissue, revealing tumor-specific regulatory mechanism.",2018,PLoS Computational Biology
Identification of biomarkers for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease in BCG-vaccinated young children in Southern India,"Pediatric tuberculosis (TB) often goes undiagnosed because of the lack of reliable diagnostic methods. With the aim of assessing biomarker(s) that can aid in the diagnosis of TB infection and disease, we investigated 746 Indian children with suspected TB. Whole-blood mRNA from 210 children was examined by dual-color Reverse-Transcriptase Multiple Ligation-dependent Probe-Amplification for the expression of 45 genes and a Bio-Plex assay for the expression of cytokines/chemokines in QuantiFERON supernatants. The study shows that transcription of SEC14L1, GUSB, BPI, CCR7 and TGFÎ²-1 (all Pâ©½0.05) was downregulated in TB disease compared with uninfected controls, while transcription of RAB33A was downregulated in TB disease compared with both latent TB (P<0.05) and controls (P<0.01). The transcription of CD4, TGFÎ²-1 (P<0.01) and the expression of IL-2 (P<0.01) and IL-13 (P<0.05) was upregulated in latent TB compared with that in controls. Using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso) model, RAB33A alone discriminated between TB disease and latent TB (area under the curve (AUC) 77.5%), whereas a combination of RAB33A, CXCL10, SEC14L1, FOXP3 and TNFRSF1A was effective in discriminating between TB disease and controls (AUC 91.7%). A combination of 11 biomarkers predicted latent TB with moderate discriminatory power (AUC 72.2%). In conclusion, RAB33A is a potential biomarker for TB disease, whereas CD4, TGFÎ²-1 and IL-2, IL-13 may identify latent TB in children.",2013,Genes and Immunity
Development and validation of a model for temporal lobe necrosis for nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with intensity modulated radiation therapy,"PurposeTo develop and validate a quantitative complication model of temporal lobe necrosis (TLN). To analyze the effect of clinical and dosimetric factors on TLN.Patients and methodsIn this study the prediction model was developed in a training cohort that consisted of 256 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients from January 2009 to December 2009. Dosimetric and clinical factors were extracted for model building. Dosimetric factors including the maximum dose, minimum dose, mean dose, dose covering specific volume and dose of percentage volume. Clinical factors include age, gender, T/N-stage, overall stage, diabetes and hypertension. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression model was used for feature selection, and prediction model building. A testing cohort containing 493 consecutive patients from January 2010 to December 2010 was used for model validation. The performance of the prediction model was assessed with respect to its calibration, discrimination.ResultsThe prediction model, which consisted of two dosimetric features (D0.5cc and D10), is significantly associated with LN status (PÂ <â€‰.001 for both training and testing cohorts). None of clinical factors show direct prediction value. The model shows good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.685 (95% CI: 0.6048â€“0.765) on testing set, and a consistent trend in calibration on testing set.ConclusionThis study presents a prediction model can be conveniently used to facilitate the individualized prediction of TLN in patients with NPC. Clinical factors have no direct impact on TLN.",2019,"Radiation Oncology (London, England)"
"Comparison of methods to construct a genetic risk score for prediction of rheumatoid arthritis in the population-based Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag Health Study, Norway.","OBJECTIVES
To evaluate selection methods among published single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA to construct predictive genetic risk scores (GRSs) in a population-based setting.


METHODS
The Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag Health (HUNT) Study is a prospective cohort study among the whole adult population of northern TrÃ¸ndelag, Norway. Participants in HUNT2 (1995-1997) and HUNT3 (2006-2008) were included (489 RA cases, 61Â 584 controls). The initial SNP selection from relevant genome-wide studies included 269 SNPs from 30 studies. Following different selection criteria, SNPs were weighted by published odds ratios. The sum of each person's carriage of all weighted susceptibility variants was calculated for each GRS.


RESULTS
The best-fitting risk score included 27 SNPs [weighted genetic risk score 27 (wGRS27)] and was identified using P-value selection criterion â‰¤5â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8, the largest possible SNP selection without high linkage disequilibrium (r2â€‰<â€‰0.8), and lasso regression to select for positive coefficients. In a logistic regression model adjusted for gender, age and ever smoking, wGRS27 was associated with RA [odds ratio 1.86 (95% CI 1.71, 2.04) for each s.d. increase, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001]. The AUC was 0.76 (95% CI 0.74, 0.78). The positive and negative predictive values were 1.6% and 99.7%, respectively, and the positive predictive value was not improved in sensitivity analyses subselecting participants to illustrate settings with increased RA prevalences. Other schemes selected more SNPs but resulted in GRSs with lower predictive ability.


CONCLUSION
Constructing a wGRS based on a smaller selection of informative SNPs improved predictive ability. Even with a relatively high AUC, the low PPV illustrates that there was a large overlap in risk variants among RA patients and controls, precluding clinical usefulness.",2020,Rheumatology
Sex determination of Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica by discriminant analysis of morphometric characters,"We present data on sexual dimorphism in some morphological measurements (wing length, head length, bill depth and bill length) in the Antarctic Petrel Thalassoica antarctica. Males were on average larger than females for all measurements. Sexual dimorphism was on average largest for bill depths whereas wing lengths discriminated least between the sexes. A discriminant function including bill depth, head length and wing length correctly sexed 92% of the sample. Due to between-measurer variation it is recommended that morphometric measurements obtained by others on sexed birds are compared with ours before proceeding with the use of the discriminant function on unsexed individuals.",2004,Polar Biology
Molecular Signatures of Immune Activation and Epithelial Barrier Remodeling Are Enhanced during the Luteal Phase of the Menstrual Cycle: Implications for HIV Susceptibility.,"UNLABELLED
The variable infectivity and transmissibility of HIV/SHIV has been recently associated with the menstrual cycle, with particular susceptibility observed during the luteal phase in nonhuman primate models and ex vivo human explant cultures, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we performed an unbiased, mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to better understand the mucosal immunological processes underpinning this observed susceptibility to HIV infection. Cervicovaginal lavage samples (n = 19) were collected, characterized as follicular or luteal phase using days since last menstrual period, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Biological insights from these data were gained using a spectrum of computational methods, including hierarchical clustering, pathway analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and partial least-squares discriminant analysis with LASSO feature selection. Of the 384 proteins identified, 43 were differentially abundant between phases (P < 0.05, â‰¥2-fold change). Cell-cell adhesion proteins and antiproteases were reduced, and leukocyte recruitment (interleukin-8 pathway, P = 1.41E-5) and extravasation proteins (P = 5.62E-4) were elevated during the luteal phase. LASSO/PLSDA identified a minimal profile of 18 proteins that best distinguished the luteal phase. This profile included cytoskeletal elements and proteases known to be involved in cellular movement. Gene set enrichment analysis associated CD4(+) T cell and neutrophil gene set signatures with the luteal phase (P < 0.05). Taken together, our findings indicate a strong association between proteins involved in tissue remodeling and leukocyte infiltration with the luteal phase, which may represent potential hormone-associated mechanisms of increased susceptibility to HIV.


IMPORTANCE
Recent studies have discovered an enhanced susceptibility to HIV infection during the progesterone-dominant luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. However, the mechanism responsible for this enhanced susceptibility has not yet been determined. Understanding the source of this vulnerability will be important for designing efficacious HIV prevention technologies for women. Furthermore, these findings may also be extrapolated to better understand the impact of exogenous hormone application, such as the use of hormonal contraceptives, on HIV acquisition risk. Hormonal contraceptives are the most widely used contraceptive method in sub-Saharan Africa, the most HIV-burdened area of the world. For this reason, research conducted to better understand how hormones impact host immunity and susceptibility factors important for HIV infection is a global health priority.",2015,Journal of virology
Group-sparse SVD Models and Their Applications in Biological Data,"Sparse Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) models have been proposed for biclustering high dimensional gene expression data to identify block patterns with similar expressions. However, these models do not take into account prior group effects upon variable selection. To this end, we first propose group-sparse SVD models with group Lasso (GL1-SVD) and group L0-norm penalty (GL0-SVD) for non-overlapping group structure of variables. However, such group-sparse SVD models limit their applicability in some problems with overlapping structure. Thus, we also propose two group-sparse SVD models with overlapping group Lasso (OGL1-SVD) and overlapping group L0-norm penalty (OGL0-SVD). We first adopt an alternating iterative strategy to solve GL1-SVD based on a block coordinate descent method, and GL0-SVD based on a projection method. The key of solving OGL1-SVD is a proximal operator with overlapping group Lasso penalty. We employ an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the proximal operator. Similarly, we develop an approximate method to solve OGL0-SVD. Applications of these methods and comparison with competing ones using simulated data demonstrate their effectiveness. Extensive applications of them onto several real gene expression data with gene prior group knowledge identify some biologically interpretable gene modules.",2018,ArXiv
J. Bio. & Env. Sci,"The use of organic waste as fertilizers in the urban and peri-urban agriculture can contribute to maintain soil fertility and solve food security. This study was done to evaluate the effect of the manure (pig and cattle) on the chemical parameters of the soils in Bobo-Dioulasso area. With that aim in mind, eight (8) farms where the animal waste is used as well as some non-cultivated plots were identified in 2012 for the study. Some samples of soil were taken for chemical analysis in a laboratory. The results showed a fall of the pHH2O balance of 0.46 and 0.51 unit respectively in the 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depths following the use of the pig waste. The content of the manure had a positive impact on the organic status of the soils by the increase of their C and N rates. An easily absorbed phosphorus rate higher in the 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depths was noted in the plots which were fertilized with pigs manure. Moreover, the content of the cattle manure is materialized by an increase of total K respectively 1210 ppm for the 0-10 cm depth and 1351 ppm for the 10-20 cm deph. Furthermore, the plots where cattle manure was used had a higher CEC with 7.18meq/100g so be it three (3) times of the plot where the manure was not used. Animal manure could be an alternative to overcome the high cost of the chemical fertilizers. *Corresponding Author: P. K.

Bio. & Env. Sci. 2014 215 | Alain et al Introduction Because of its unfavorable impacts on the agricultural production, the food security and on the environment, the deterioration of the soils has become a handicap in the developing countries (FAO, 2003). The majority of sub-saharian African countries are confronted by a weak rainfall and the poverty of the soil with as consequence the weak return of the rain cultures (IFPRI, 2009). In Burkina Faso, the traditional systems of production are known for a weak use of the mineral fertilizer because of their cost. The continuous exploitation of the soil leads to a speed degradation of the soil main biological, chemical and physical properties (Sedogo et al., 1997; Lompo, 2008). These biophysical constraints explain the use of some organic fertilizers to raise back the fertility of the soils (Sedogo and al., 1997; Fening and al., 2011). Several methods of fertility management including the use of organic matter from various sources are practiced in Burkina Faso, as in most countries of West Africa (Sedogo et al., 1997; Bationo and Buerkert, 2001; Mando and al., 2005; Achieng and al., 2010). Most of these studies focused on the effects of management practices on soil fertility nutrient balances. Itâ€™s however recognized that the enrichment of the soil with a fresh or decomposed animal waste can be the key to the success of sustainable agriculture in the developing countries (Diao, 2004; Moral and al., 2008; Maltas et al., 2012). However, just as the challenge of the maintenance of the soil fertility under a continuous culture is arisen with acuteness, all the sources of organic waste are less or not good exploited in the semi-arid regions (Autfray et al., 2012). In this context, manure has an important place taking in view of many functions that it has on certain components of the soil. Indeed, many studies (Dambreville and al., 2004; Nacro and al., 2006; Pallo et al., 2008) had emphasized its capacity to limit the fall of the soil organic matter, to maintain the CEC, the capacity of water retention and to limit the exchangeable aluminum rate through some complexassion processes. Then, a reasonable supply of the farm fertilizers contributes to the increase of the cultures output and to a better conservation of the quality of the soil by the consolidation of the main mineral elements (Huaiying and al., 2009; Maltas et al., 2012). Moreover, to our knowledge, there are no scientific references on our country that evaluated the effects of the single long-term application of animal manure on the evolution of chemical soil parameters. However, the repeated use of the organic fertilizers, mainly in the short and in the long terms, can cause an overfertilization of the soil which can lead to aluminum toxicity phenomenon in the plots, the accumulation of the heavy metals and water pollution due to a transfer (Bock, 1994; Ramade, 2009). It is then necessary to have some optimal doses for each type of soils and cultures (Sedogo et al., 1997; Fening and al., 2011). Further to this considerations on soil chemical quality and regarding the fast increase in animal production within the zone of Bobo-Dioulasso (south soudanian zone), there is a need to collect scientific evidence and field data on the role of manure (various types) application on soil chemical status and composition",2013,
Volatility Spillovers in Commodity Markets : A large t-vector autoregressive approach,"Prices of commodities have shown large fluctuations. A high volatility of one commodity today may impact the volatility of another commodity tomorrow. As such, agricultural and energy commodities are closely dependent due to the expansion of the biofuel industry. We study volatility spillovers among a large number of energy, agriculture and biofuel commodities using the vector auto regressive (VAR) model. To account for the possible fat-tailed distribution of the model errors, we propose the t-lasso method for obtaining a large VAR. The t-lasso is shown to have excellent properties, and a forecast analysis shows that the t-lasso attains better forecast accuracy than standard estimators. Our empirical analysis shows the existence of volatility spillovers between energy and biofuel, and between energy and agricultural commodities.",2020,Energy Economics
Sugar and NICE â€“ Aggressive Hyperglycaemic Control in Ischaemic Stroke and What Can We Learn from Non-Neurological Intensive Glucose Control Trials in the Critically Ill?,"There are two lines of evidence that drove the evolution of these guidelines: (1) The weight of arguments that suggest an association between high glucose levels and detrimental outcome has substantially increased in the last few years. Observational studies, both naturalistic [8, 9] and trialassociated [10â€“12] , have reported higher morbidity and mortality in patients with initial hyperglycaemia. (Note that there is neither consensus as to what actually defines â€˜initialâ€™ â€“ is it a 1-measurement baseline, continuously elevated levels within the first 24 h or other timelines? â€“ nor is there a clear definition of when hyperglycaemia necessitates treatment [13] .) Moreover, experimental data have underlined the association. Early neuropathological animal studies provided evidence that hyperglycaemia augments morphological brain damage in acute stroke [14, 15] . Imaging studies in hyperglycaemic animals subjected to ischaemic stroke corroborated these findings: hyperglycaemia is associated with enhanced MRI diffusion-weighted imaging alterations [16] and reduced hemispheric cerebral blood volume [17] . Importantly, equivalent correlations have been established in MRI studies in human subjects. Acute hyperglycaemia is associated with reduced salvage of perfusion-impaired tissue and larger final infarct size [18, 19] . This is also true for patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen Hyperglycaemia is a common phenomenon after cerebral ischaemia (for that matter, after most acute medical or surgical conditions), and clinicians have certainly been itching to treat. But should we? The devil is in the details. Continuous assessment of blood glucose levels and qualified treatment are often noted to be core components of specialized stroke care [1] . Expert statements have taken a somewhat sinusoidal course when discussing the matter. In 1994, the Stroke Council of the American Heart Association said that it may be a good idea to treat hyperglycaemia in patients with stroke just as one would treat hyperglycaemia in â€˜other persons with elevated blood glucoseâ€™ [2] . The guideline was substantiated in 2003, with treatment then being warranted should blood glucose levels exceed 16.6 mmol/l (300 mg/dl) [3] . Europeans were more stringent, finding that a cut-off of 10 mmol/l (180 mg/dl) would be optimal [4, 5] . The American Stroke Association followed this lead and in 2007 revised its suggestions and noted that treatment should begin above 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl), possibly as low as 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) [6] . In 2008, instead of continuing on the downward track and effectively postulating fasting normoglycaemia below 5.5 mmol/l (99 mg/dl), the European Stroke Organization retained its previous recommendation of 10 mmol/l (180 mg/dl) [7] .

Radiomics in predicting mutation status for thyroid cancer: A preliminary study using radiomics features for predicting BRAFV600E mutations in papillary thyroid carcinoma,"PURPOSE
To evaluate whether if ultrasonography (US)-based radiomics enables prediction of the presence of BRAFV600E mutations among patients diagnosed as papillary thyroid carcninoma (PTC).


METHODS
From December 2015 to May 2017, 527 patients who had been treated surgically for PTC were included (training: 387, validation: 140). All patients had BRAFV600E mutation analysis performed on surgical specimen. Feature extraction was performed using preoperative US images of the 527 patients (mean size of PTC: 16.4mmÂ±7.9, range, 10-85 mm). A Radiomics Score was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. Univariable/multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the factors including Radiomics Score in predicting BRAFV600E mutation. Subgroup analysis including conventional PTC <20-mm (n = 389) was performed (training: 280, validation: 109).


RESULTS
Of the 527 patients diagnosed with PTC, 428 (81.2%) were positive and 99 (18.8%) were negative for BRAFV600E mutation. In both total 527 cancers and 389 conventional PTC<20-mm, Radiomics Score was the single factor showing significant association to the presence of BRAFV600E mutation on multivariable analysis (all P<0.05). C-statistics for the validation set in the total cancers and the conventional PTCs<20-mm were lower than that of the training set: 0.629 (95% CI: 0.516-0.742) to 0.718 (95% CI: 0.650-0.786), and 0.567 (95% CI: 0.434-0.699) to 0.729 (95% CI: 0.632-0.826), respectively.


CONCLUSION
Radiomics features extracted from US has limited value as a non-invasive biomarker for predicting the presence of BRAFV600E mutation status of PTC regardless of size.",2020,PLoS ONE
A sparse large margin semi-supervised learning method,"Abstract In this paper, we propose a sparse semi-supervised learning method, which combines the large margin approach and the L 1 constraint. The main contribution of the paper is to develop an efficient optimization algorithm. The objective function to be minimized in a large margin semi-supervised learning method is non-convex and non-differentiable, and hence special optimization algorithms are required. For this purpose, we develop an optimization algorithm, which is a hybrid of the CCCP and the gradient LASSO algorithm. The advantage of the proposed method over existing semi-supervised learning methods is that it can identify a small number of relevant input variables while keeping the prediction accuracy high. Also, the proposed algorithm is simple enough that it can be applied to various real problems without being much hampered by computational limitations. To confirm these advantages, we compare the proposed method with the standard semi-supervised method by analyzing simulated as well as real data sets.",2010,Journal of The Korean Statistical Society

"[Current aspects of human salmonellosis in Upper Volta. Study carried out at Centre Muraz (Bobo-Dioulasso) from 1966 to 1977: isolation of 1,013 Salmonella strains].","In a long term research programme of Centre Muraz a study on salmonellosis in Upper Volta has been carried out, at Bobo-Dioulasso, from 1966 to 1977. Investigations have been executed at Centre Muraz, at Bobo-Dioulasso hospital and at Ouagadougou hospital. All the strains of Salmonella were collected at Centre Muraz by biology laboratory, which is a reference service for Upper Volta. This country is include; among the 32 countries which collaborate with W.H.O. and are involved in the world epidemiological surveillance of salmonellosis. For twelve years, 1.013 Samonella strains have been isolated : 1.002 from man and only 11 from animals. The study, which is presented, deals with human salmonellosis. These diseases have been considered from several points of view : bacteriology, clinic, treatment and epidemiology. The various origins of these strains have been specified. The different technics used for diagnosis are discussed briefly : hemoculture (for typhoÃ¯d fever and few other types of salmonellosis), coproculture (for ""minor"" salmonellosis) are the most common and useful methods. Among the 1.013 which have been found, S. typhi is highly predominant (67 p. 100). In the other hand, S. dublin and S. typhi murium play an important role in the various serotypes which occured. A total of 76 serotypes, already known elsewhere, but found for the first time in Upper Volta, have been observed. Three new serotypes have been described : S. bobo, S. kua and S. farakan. As far as clinical problem is concerned, two main aspects are frequent : either typhoid fever syndrome (caused by S. typhi and, scarcely, by other germs, like S. dublin) or gastrointestinal infections, which present different forms and are more or less severe. Up to now, one single strain of S. typhi murium, suspected to be resistant to chloramphenicol has been isolated in 1977. Such a problem would need more complete research in a reference centre. Otherwise, no epidemic multiresistance has been observed. Checking strictly all the strains by systematic antibiograms is now absolutly essential in the plan of a steady epidemiological surveillance.",1979,Medecine tropicale : revue du Corps de sante colonial
Extraction of Urban Waterlogging Depth from Video Images Using Transfer Learning,"Urban flood control requires real-time and spatially detailed information regarding the waterlogging depth over large areas, but such information cannot be effectively obtained by the existing methods. Video supervision equipment, which is readily available in most cities, can record urban waterlogging processes in video form. These video data could be a valuable data source for waterlogging depth extraction. The present paper is aimed at demonstrating a new approach to extract urban waterlogging depths from video images based on transfer learning and lasso regression. First, a transfer learning model is used to extract feature vectors from a video image set of urban waterlogging. Second, a lasso regression model is trained with these feature vectors and employed to calculate the waterlogging depth. Two case studies in China were used to evaluate the proposed method, and the experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the method. This method can be applied to video images from widespread cameras in cities, so that a powerful urban waterlogging monitoring network can be formed.",2018,Water
Logical defects of the TGAT report,"IIn late 1987 the Task Group on Assessment and Testing (TGAT) proposed an assessment framework for the National Curriculum which was widely welcomed.' The statutory provisions for Maths, Science and English have been laid down in accordance with the TGAT framework. As schools are rushed towards full implementation of the National Curriculum, plenty of fears have surfaced. Consider just two of them. Busy teachers will find it impossible to carry out the detailed informal pupil assessment which the Standard Assessment Tests (SATs) are supposed to moderate. Published results will introduce unsavoury market place values into schooling, to the peculiar detriment of special needs pupils, inner city schools and children from ethnic minorities. Discard the second fear if you reject the particular values which seem to underpin it. As for the first fear, making life impossible for classoom teachers has not prevented other 'reforms', so why should we worry about this one? My anxieties about TGAT are not grounded in a set of values. They arise rather from an appreciation of the nature both of pupil learning, and of our talk about aspects of pupil behaviour. TGAT proposes that many of the National Curriculum subjects be divided into Attainment Targets, covering the range of knowledge, skills and understanding to be taught by schools. Each Attainment Target should be further divided into up to 10 levels. These should cover the full range of attainment expected from most pupils during compulsory education. The 'distance' between one level and the next is supposed to relate to the progress children make over two years. Both 'progress' and 'levels', however, should be described for each subject in terms which do not refer to children's 'normal performance' at particular ages.",1990,British Journal of Educational Studies
"Aptian-Late Cenomanian Fluvio-Lacustrine Lithofacies and Palynomorphs from Mamfe Basin, Southwest Cameroon, West Africa","The sedimentary sequences 
in the Mamfe Basin are generally thought of as continental (fluvio-lacustrine) 
in origin. But the wide spread occurrence of salt springs and salt 
accumulations and in places gypsum, often puts to question the exclusive 
continentality throughout this basinâ€™s history. The sequences studied portray a 
wide range of complex lithologies and lithofacies relationships and include basal 
and intra-formational conglomerates, sandstones, shales, carbonaceous, 
carbonate and halite facies respectively. All these are well exposed at several 
outcrop sections distributed all over the basin with some measuring up to and 
above 30 m in height.Â Sedimentary 
structures include: parallel aligned imbricated prismatic pebbles, plannar to 
trough-cross stratifications, fining upward grain size distribution and thin 
frequently alternating sandstone-shale beds. Palynological data have been 
obtained for the first time from the shally and carbonate intervals and 
integrated with five lithofacies associations, permitting the determination of 
the ages and paleo environmental reconstruction. The palynomorphs are 
characterized by pteridophytic spores dominated byÂ CicatricosisporitesÂ sp.,CyathiditesÂ sp. andÂ DeltoidsporaÂ sp., pollen grains include 
gymnosperms dominated byÂ Classopollis 
annulatusÂ andÂ Classopollis todosusÂ and angiosperms represented byÂ RetitricolpitesÂ sp. andÂ RetimoncolpitesÂ sp., fungal remains include some 
hyphae andÂ FusiformisporitesÂ sp. Only a few dinoflagellate 
cysts dominantlyÂ SpiniferitesÂ were encountered at Nfaitok 
outcrop, suggesting a proximal sea water influence. A fluvial, 
lacustrine-deltaic and an anoxic deep bottom lake setting sub-environments were 
reconstructed with no marine strata encountered. The brines are here suggested 
to have originated from sea water splay over a barrier and complimented by the 
chemistry of the drained surrounding country rocks. The palynomorph assemblage 
suggests an Aptian-Turonian age for the studied sequences and a 
chronostratigraphic sequence in which the Nfaitok and Satom Bridge units are 
both Late Cenomanian-Turonian (lateral equivalents of each other) are younger 
and overlie the Aptian-Early-Cenomanian Okoyong sandstone unit.",2015,International Journal of Geosciences
Virtual metrology of semiconductor PVD process based on combination of tree-based ensemble model.,"In order to improve the accuracy of semiconductor wafer virtual metrology, and overcome the physical metrology delay of wafer acceptance test, a virtual physical vapor deposition metrology method based on combination of tree-based ensemble models is proposed to conduct online virtual metrology on semiconductor wafer electrical parameters, and use hyperparameter optimization technique to perform model optimization and to achieve real-time alarm on process deviation. This combination of tree-based ensemble model combines Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking techniques. First, based on 4 types of base learner, Random Forest, Extra-Trees, XGBoost, and lightGBM, preliminary virtual metrology is performed on wafer PVD process, and then transforms the predict results of the 4 base learners into meta feature vector as the input of meta learner lightGBM to perform further virtual metrology. The Sequential model-based optimization algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of virtual metrology. First, the initial hyperparameter of the sequential model-based optimization is initialized by using random sampling, then the combination model is approximated by the surrogate model of tree-structured Parzen estimator, and the recommended hyperparameters is obtained by using EI (Expected Improvement), and then the optimized combination model is obtained. Finally, the superiority of the method proposed in this paper is verified by studying the results comparing to the common virtual metrology methods on the PVD process. The experiment shows the result of resistivity metrology using the combination of tree-based ensemble models in the PVD process is significantly better than LASSO regression, partial least squares regression(PLSR), support vector machine(SVR), Gaussian process regression(GPR) and artificial neural network regression(ANN).",2020,ISA transactions
AdaPtive Noisy Data Augmentation (PANDA) for Simultaneous Construction of Multiple Graph Models.,"We extend the data augmentation technique PANDA by Li et al. (2018) that regularizes single graph estimation to jointly learning multiple graphical models with various node types in a unified framework. We design two types of noise to augment the observed data: the first type regularizes the estimation of each graph while the second type promotes either the structural similarity, referred as the \joint group lasso regularization, or the numerical similarity, referred as the joint fused ridge regularization, among the edges in the same position across graphs. The computation in PANDA is straightforward and only involves obtaining maximum likelihood estimator in generalized linear models in an iterative manner. The simulation studies demonstrate PANDA is non-inferior to existing joint estimation approaches for Gaussian graphical models, and significantly improves over the naive differencing approach for non-Gaussian graphical models. We apply PANDA to a real-life lung cancer microarray data to simultaneously construct four protein networks.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Variable selection in monotone single-index models via the adaptive LASSO.,"We consider the problem of variable selection for monotone single-index models. A single-index model assumes that the expectation of the outcome is an unknown function of a linear combination of covariates. Assuming monotonicity of the unknown function is often reasonable and allows for more straightforward inference. We present an adaptive LASSO penalized least squares approach to estimating the index parameter and the unknown function in these models for continuous outcome. Monotone function estimates are achieved using the pooled adjacent violators algorithm, followed by kernel regression. In the iterative estimation process, a linear approximation to the unknown function is used, therefore reducing the situation to that of linear regression and allowing for the use of standard LASSO algorithms, such as coordinate descent. Results of a simulation study indicate that the proposed methods perform well under a variety of circumstances and that an assumption of monotonicity, when appropriate, noticeably improves performance. The proposed methods are applied to data from a randomized clinical trial for the treatment of a critical illness in the intensive care unit.",2013,Statistics in medicine
37 Evidence-based medicine course as part of an international medical education curriculum in a russian medical school,"Objectives Russian medical schools are currently incorporating evidence-based medicine (EBM) principles into their curricula. However, many medical schools still lack ancillary courses on research methods, epidemiology, biostatistics, etc., that result in reportedly poor quality of medical research in Russia. 1 2 Many reasons for the difficulties have been identified, including linguistic barriers, lack of expertise, limited international collaboration, and inadequate allocation of resources. We hypothesized that the addition of an elective EBM curriculum to students in a Russian medical school would develop skills in searching, interpreting and evaluating medical literature, essential components of EBM. As part of an international collaborative education program between two departments of anesthesiology, the EBM elective curriculum was created and introduced to all medical students (years 1-6). We then assessed the value of the course, studentsâ€™ attitude towards EBM, the extent to which they are engaged with evidence-based methodology, and the ability to incorporate EBM principles into future practice. Method The collaborative education program was created between the Department of Anesthesiology, Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California (KSOM, USA) and the Department of Anesthesiology, School of Medicine and Psychology at the Novosibirsk State University (NSU, Russia). The EBM course included 18 seminars and journal clubs on biostatistics, clinical epidemiology, research methodology and other aspects of EBM. Classes were transmitted through video chat from KSOM to NSU, were voluntary and held in English. The course evaluation took place at the conclusion of the first year and consisted of two questionnaires. The first (Qs#1) was for the course participants and a second (Qs#2) was generally distributed among all students to learn about the potential course benefits and their understanding of EBM principles and importance. The questionnaires were distributed online as a GoogleForm (all questions were mandatory, one response per IP) and responses were anonymous. Results Twenty-five students participated in the course. From 152 responses on Qs#1, only 76% agreed that clinical decision-making should be based on scientific evidence. A median frequency of reading medical literature was reported as once a week in their native language and once a month in English. On a scale from 1 to 10, respondents ranked their understanding of scientific manuscripts as 6.3 Â± 1.8, their confidence in assessing the quality of research as 5.5 Â± 2.1. Respondents rated their interest in staying current with literature as 9.0 Â± 1.5, and a potential benefit from learning critical thinking as 8.8 Â± 1.6. In a set of matched questions in Qs#2, course participants reported that the course was valuable, helped build confidence in assessing research articles, and improved critical thinking. Participants vs. non-participants are more familiar with EBM (8.2 Â± 2.2 vs. 6.6 Â± 2.8, p-value=0.002) and read medical literature more frequently (native language p-value=0.039, English p-value=0.003). Conclusions Based on prior publications, 1 2 some Russian medical schools lack an EBM curriculum. By surveying a general medical student population, we found a discrepancy between the current and desired level of understanding of EBM indicating an unmet need. Currently, students feel insecure in applying EBM principles and have a deficiency in reading medical literature, especially in English. The EBM course, one component of an international education program, was established to create a scientific-centered learning environment, to provide expertise in EBM, and to help students overcome linguistic barrier. The participant evaluations showed that the course addressed positively the demonstrated needs of students and improved their reading and understanding of medical literature. We present evidence that reflects need for and benefits of including EBM in the medical curriculum. These findings indicate that international collaboration enhanced the medical studentsâ€™ educational experience by augmenting previously unavailable curricular content and should be continued.

Underdetermined DOA Estimation Using MVDR-Weighted LASSO,"The direction of arrival (DOA) estimation problem is formulated in a compressive sensing (CS) framework, and an extended array aperture is presented to increase the number of degrees of freedom of the array. The ordinary least square adaptable least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (OLS A-LASSO) is applied for the first time for DOA estimation. Furthermore, a new LASSO algorithm, the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) A-LASSO, which solves the DOA problem in the CS framework, is presented. The proposed algorithm does not depend on the singular value decomposition nor on the orthogonality of the signal and the noise subspaces. Hence, the DOA estimation can be done without a priori knowledge of the number of sources. The proposed algorithm can estimate up to ( ( M 2 - 2 ) / 2 + M - 1 ) / 2 sources using M sensors without any constraints or assumptions about the nature of the signal sources. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm exhibits performance that is superior compared to that of the classical DOA estimation methods, especially for low signal to noise ratios (SNR), spatially-closed sources and coherent scenarios.",2016,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)"
Hyperspectral Band Selection for Face Recognition Based on a Structurally Sparsified Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Hyperspectral imaging systems collect and process information from specific wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. The fusion of multi-spectral bands in the visible spectrum has been exploited to improve face recognition performance over conventional broad band face images. In this paper, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework which adopts a structural sparsity learning technique to select the optimal spectral bands to obtain the best face recognition performance over all of the spectral bands. Specifically, in this method, all the bands are fed to a CNN and the convolutional filters in the first layer of the CNN are then regularized by employing a group Lasso algorithm to zero out the redundant bands during the training of the network. Contrary to other methods which usually select the bands manually or in a greedy fashion, our method selects the optimal spectral bands automatically to achieve the best face recognition performance over all the spectral bands. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state of the art band selection methods for face recognition on several publicly-available hyperspectral face image datasets.",2019,2019 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)

Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients with valvular heart disease: long-term follow-up results.,"UNLABELLED
AF Ablation in Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.


BACKGROUND
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation in patients with moderate valvular heart disease (VHD).


METHODS
In total, 534 consecutive patients who underwent AF ablation were enrolled. Patients with a history of valve surgery or other structural heart disease were excluded. Patients with clinically moderate VHD (group-1, n = 45) were compared with those without VHD (control group-2, n = 436). Ipsilateral pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) was performed with a double Lasso technique in all the patients. Left atrial (LA) linear ablation was undertaken in persistent AF patients, if AF was inducible after PVAI.


RESULTS
Patients in group-1 were significantly older and had a larger LA. PVAI was successfully achieved in all the patients. Patients in group-1 received LA linear ablation more frequently during the index procedure. After a median of 26 months from the index procedure, the freedom from AF was significantly lower in group-1 than group-2 off antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) (47% vs 69%, P = 0.002). Although there were more number of total procedures in group-1 than group-2, the freedom from AF was lower at median 24 months after the last procedure (78% vs 87%, P = 0.038). There was no significant difference in the freedom from AF on AADs (91% vs 95%, P = 0.356) or complication rate between the 2 groups. Atrial tachycardia following the index procedure was observed more frequently in group-1 (P = 0.001).


CONCLUSION
The patients with VHD undergoing AF ablation are less likely to remain in sinus rhythm at long term without AADs than those without VHD.",2010,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology
Lasso Meets Horseshoe,"The goal of our paper is to survey and contrast the major advances in two of the most commonly used high-dimensional techniques, namely, the Lasso and horseshoe regularization methodologies. Lasso is a gold standard for best subset selection of predictors while the horseshoe is a state-of-the-art Bayesian estimator for sparse signals. Lasso is scalable and fast using convex optimization whilst the horseshoe is a non-convex penalty. Our novel perspective focuses on three aspects, (i) efficiency and scalability of computation and (ii) methodological development and performance and (iii) theoretical optimality in high dimensional inference for the Gaussian sparse model and beyond.",2017,
Common Substructure Learning of Multiple Graphical Gaussian Models,"Learning underlying mechanisms of data generation is of great interest in the scientific and engineering fields amongst others. Finding dependency structures among variables in the data is one possible approach for the purpose, and is an important task in data mining. In this paper, we focus on learning dependency substructures shared by multiple datasets. In many scenarios, the nature of data varies due to a change in the surrounding conditions or non-stationary mechanisms over the multiple datasets. However, we can also assume that the change occurs only partially and some relations between variables remain unchanged. Moreover, we can expect that such commonness over the multiple datasets is closely related to the invariance of the underlying mechanism. For example, errors in engineering systems are usually caused by faults in the sub-systems with the other parts remaining healthy. In such situations, though anomalies are observed in sensor values, the underlying invariance of the healthy sub-systems is still captured by some steady dependency structures before and after the onset of the error. We propose a structure learning algorithm to find such invariances in the case of Graphical Gaussian Models (GGM). The proposed method is based on a block coordinate descent optimization, where subproblems can be solved efficiently by existing algorithms for Lasso and the continuous quadratic knapsack problem. We confirm the validity of our approach through numerical simulations and also in applications with real world datasets extracted from the analysis of city-cycle fuel consumption and anomaly detection in car sensors.",2011,
Comment on article by Polson and Scott,"We congratulate the authors for a very interesting article. The key contribution of this paper, as we see it and as suggested in the title, is the introduction of latent parameters to carry out Bayesian analysis with support vector machines. The basic identities (4) and (6) are particularly useful in this regard, which enable one to overcome much of the complexities of a non smooth loss resulting in a non smooth likelihood. As an anecdote, from a Bayesian angle, it is extremely convenient to view the loss as the negative of the loglikelihood (for example associating squared error loss with the normal likelihood) and the penalty part with the prior. This is the approach taken in this paper, and also earlier in Mallick et al. (2005). Based on a loss function, we can obtain the normalized or the non-normalized (or pseudo) likelihood. The authors considered the non-normalized likelihood and that way obtained the pseudo posterior distribution. This pseudo posterior distribution may not be suitable to make probabilistic inference. Mallick et al. (2005) considered both the normalized and the non-normalized likelihoods and the classiflcation performances were compatible. It will be interesting to see how the proposed method can be adapted for the model with the normalized likelihood. The introduction of latent parameters facilitates Bayesian variable selection with LASSO (Park and Casella (2008); Bae and Mallick (2007)) and its generalizations such as grouped LASSO, fused LASSO and elastic net (Kyung et al., 2010; Chakraborty and Guo, 2010). Not surprisingly, this helps also in classiflcation problems with a penalty function which is the same as in LASSO. One interesting feature in this paper is the consideration of a general fi in (6) rather than the conventional fi = 1 or 2. Corollary 4 in this paper seems to be an interesting result, especially because of its importance in developing the necessary algorithm.",2011,Bayesian Analysis
Graph estimation for Gaussian data zero-inflated by double truncation,"We consider the problem of graph estimation in a zero-inflated Gaussian model. In this model, zero-inflation is obtained by double truncation (right and left) of a Gaussian vector. The goal is to recover the latent graph structure of the Gaussian vector with observations of the zero-inflated truncated vector. We propose a two step estimation procedure. The first step consists in estimating each term of the covariance matrix by maximising the corresponding bivariate marginal log-likelihood of the truncated vector. The second one uses the graphical lasso procedure to estimate the precision matrix sparsity, which encodes the graph structure. We then state some theoretical convergence results about the convergence rate of the covariance matrix and precision matrix estimators. These results allow us to establish consistency of our procedure with respect to graph structure recovery. We also present some simulation studies to corroborate the efficiency of our procedure.",2019,
Dependent relevance determination for smooth and structured sparse regression,"In many problem settings, parameter vectors are not merely sparse, but dependent in such a way that non-zero coefficients tend to cluster together. We refer to this form of dependency as ""region sparsity"". Classical sparse regression methods, such as the lasso and automatic relevance determination (ARD), which model parameters as independent a priori, and therefore do not exploit such dependencies. Here we introduce a hierarchical model for smooth, region-sparse weight vectors and tensors in a linear regression setting. Our approach represents a hierarchical extension of the relevance determination framework, where we add a transformed Gaussian process to model the dependencies between the prior variances of regression weights. We combine this with a structured model of the prior variances of Fourier coefficients, which eliminates unnecessary high frequencies. The resulting prior encourages weights to be region-sparse in two different bases simultaneously. We develop Laplace approximation and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling to provide efficient inference for the posterior. Furthermore, a two-stage convex relaxation of the Laplace approximation approach is also provided to relax the inevitable non-convexity during the optimization. We finally show substantial improvements over comparable methods for both simulated and real datasets from brain imaging.",2019,J. Mach. Learn. Res.
Multisnapshot Sparse Bayesian Learning for DOA,"The directions of arrival (DOA) of plane waves are estimated from multisnapshot sensor array data using sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). The prior for the source amplitudes is assumed independent zero-mean complex Gaussian distributed with hyperparameters, the unknown variances (i.e., the source powers). For a complex Gaussian likelihood with hyperparameter, the unknown noise variance, the corresponding Gaussian posterior distribution is derived. The hyperparameters are automatically selected by maximizing the evidence and promoting sparse DOA estimates. The SBL scheme for DOA estimation is discussed and evaluated competitively against LASSO (â„“1-regularization), conventional beamforming, and MUSIC.",2016,IEEE Signal Processing Letters
The flare package for high dimensional linear regression and precision matrix estimation in R,"This paper describes an R package named flare, which implements a family of new high dimensional regression methods (LAD Lasso, SQRT Lasso, â„“ q Lasso, and Dantzig selector) and their extensions to sparse precision matrix estimation (TIGER and CLIME). These methods exploit different nonsmooth loss functions to gain modeling exibility, estimation robustness, and tuning insensitiveness. The developed solver is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is further accelerated by the multistage screening approach. The package flare is coded in double precision C, and called from R by a user-friendly interface. The memory usage is optimized by using the sparse matrix output. The experiments show that flare is efficient and can scale up to large problems.",2015,Journal of machine learning research : JMLR
Isolation and characterization of algicidal bacteria from Cochlodinium polykrikoides culture,"In this study, we analyzed a bacterial community closely associated with Cochlodinium polykrikoides that caused harmful algal blooming in the sea. Filtration using a plankton mesh and percoll gradient centrifugation were performed to eliminate free-living bacteria. Attached bacteria were analyzed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Five culturable bacterial strains were isolated and identified from the C. polykrikoides mixed bacterial community. The isolates belonged to Î±-Proteobacteria (Nautella sp., Sagittula sp., and Thalassobius sp.) and Î³-Proteobacteria (Alteromonas sp. and Pseudoalteromonas sp.). All of the 5 isolates showed algicidal activity against C. polykrikoides and produced extracellular compounds responsible for algicidal properties after entering the stationary phase. The algicidal compounds produced by the 5 isolates were heat-stable and had molecular masses of less than 10,000 Da. Furthermore, the algicidal compounds were relatively specific for C. polykrikoides in terms of their algicidal activities. Culture-independent analysis of the bacterial community in association with C. polykrikoides was performed using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). On the basis of the PCR-DGGE profile, Sagittula sp. was identified as a dominant species in the bacterial community of C. polykrikoides.",2011,Biotechnology and Bioprocess Engineering
"Sparse Bayesian dynamic network models, with genomics applications","Network models have become an important topic in modern statistics, and the evolution of network structure over time is an important new area of study, relevant to a range of applications. An important application of statistical network modelling is in genomics: network models are a natural way to describe and analyse patterns of interactions between genes and their products. However, whilst network models are well established in genomics, historically these models have mostly been static network models, ignoring the dynamic nature of genomic processes. 
In this work, we propose a model to infer dynamic genomic network structure, based on single-cell measurements of gene-expression counts. Our model draws on ideas from the Bayesian lasso and from copula modelling, and is implemented efficiently by combining Gibbs- and slice-sampling techniques. We apply the modelling to data from neural development, and infer changes in network structure which match current biological knowledge, as well as discovering novel network structures which identify potential targets for further experimental investigation by neuro-biologists.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
"More powerful post-selection inference, with application to the Lasso","Investigators often use the data to generate interesting hypotheses and then perform inference for the generated hypotheses. P-values and confidence intervals must account for this explorative data analysis. A fruitful method for doing so is to condition any inferences on the components of the data used to generate the hypotheses, thus preventing information in those components from being used again. Some currently popular methods ""over-condition"", leading to wide intervals. We show how to perform the minimal conditioning in a computationally tractable way. In high dimensions, even this minimal conditioning can lead to intervals that are too wide to be useful, suggesting that up to now the cost of hypothesis generation has been underestimated. We show how to generate hypotheses in a strategic manner that sharply reduces the cost of data exploration and results in useful confidence intervals. Our discussion focuses on the problem of post-selection inference after fitting a lasso regression model, but we also outline its extension to a much more general setting.",2018,arXiv: Methodology

Determination of scattering and absorption coefficients from experimental data : Application to sunscreen lotions,"Materials with pronounced light scattering are of large interest in a variety of scientific and technical disciplines. Their optical properties can to a good approximation be described by two-flux (Kubelka-Munk) theory [1]. This theory considers one light beam propagating in the forward direction and one beam propagating in the backward direction in the material. The optical properties of the material are described by phenomenological scattering (S) and absorption (K) coefficients. Additional parameters are the internal reflection coefficients for diffuse light at the interfaces and the reflection coefficient for incident collimated light at the front interface. The large amount of parameters makes it difficult to invert experimental measurements of transmittance (T) and reflectance (R) in order to obtain the parameters S and K characterizing the material [2,3]. We propose a method to partially overcome this problem in special cases by invoking physically realistic approximations for the reflection coefficients. We consider viscous emulsions or polymeric materials positioned between two transparent substrates separated by a spacer. Many organic and polymeric materials have refractive indices sufficiently close to those of glass and quartz substrates so that reflections between the material and the glass can be neglected. The reflection coefficient of the substrate for collimated light is known from its refractive index. Measurements of R and T in a region of weak scattering and absorption allow us to put quite stringent limits on the internal reflection coefficients for diffuse light. In this way good approximative values for S and K can be obtained.We apply this method to spectrophotometric measurements on two commercial sunscreen lotions. A drop of lotion was applied on a quartz substrate and a second quartz plate was put on top. The quartz plates were separated by aluminium foil of thickness 11 mm, except in the area covered by the lotion. Measurements of total R and T were taken by a Perkin-Elmer lambda-900 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere, in the wavelength range 250-800 nm. The samples were completely diffuse scattering and measurements in a low scattering region indicated a preferential forward scattering. The absorption coefficient was found to be low in the visible region and increased very much in the ultraviolet (UV). The scattering coefficient increased towards shorter wavelengths in the visible but exhibited differing behaviours in the UV. A sunscreen containing TiO2 particles exhibited a very low UV scattering together with higher scattering in the visible range, see fig. 1. Fig. 1.

Simultaneous estimation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions for numerous loci using double penalized log-likelihood.,"Many common human diseases are considered to be caused by complex multifactorial processes. For these diseases, it is expected that numerous genetic and environmental factors and, possibly, their interactions play a role. Therefore, simultaneously analyzing the effects of numerous genes and environmental factors is a more realistic approach compared to single gene analyses, but the large number of genes and environmental factors pose a challenge, not in the least due to the limitations created by the tools available for analyzing such high-dimensional models. In the present manuscript we propose a method that is capable of identifying ""true"" interactions in a setting where the number of effects to be estimated is very large and can even surpass the number of observations. Basically, all possible (interaction) effects are entered in a double penalized model, where main effects are ridge penalized, whereas the interactions are subjected to a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) penalty. Results from the simulations and real data show that the proposed method is capable of detecting interactions even with relative small effect sizes.",2006,Genetic epidemiology
A Hierarchical Poisson Log-Normal Model for Network Inference from RNA Sequencing Data,"Gene network inference from transcriptomic data is an important methodological challenge and a key aspect of systems biology. Although several methods have been proposed to infer networks from microarray data, there is a need for inference methods able to model RNA-seq data, which are count-based and highly variable. In this work we propose a hierarchical Poisson log-normal model with a Lasso penalty to infer gene networks from RNA-seq data; this model has the advantage of directly modelling discrete data and accounting for inter-sample variance larger than the sample mean. Using real microRNA-seq data from breast cancer tumors and simulations, we compare this method to a regularized Gaussian graphical model on log-transformed data, and a Poisson log-linear graphical model with a Lasso penalty on power-transformed data. For data simulated with large inter-sample dispersion, the proposed model performs better than the other methods in terms of sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve. These results show the necessity of methods specifically designed for gene network inference from RNA-seq data.",2013,PLoS ONE

Comparing Approaches to Treatment Effect Estimation for Subgroups in Early Phase Clinical Trials,"Identifying subgroups, which respond differently to a treatment, both in terms of efficacy and safety, is an important part of drug development. In early phase exploratory clinical trials the well-known challenges of subgroup analyses are further amplified by the low sample size and because relatively limited clinical prior information on the drug is available. We evaluate some novel strategies for subgroup identification and treatment effect estimation in these settings in a simulation study motivated by real clinical trial situations. We compare several approaches to estimate treatment effects for selected subgroups, employing model averaging, resampling and lasso regression methods. For subgroup identification two approaches are compared, one based on categorization of covariates and the other based on splines. Our results show that naive estimation of the treatment effect, which ignores that a selection has taken place, leads to bias and overoptimistic conclusions. For the considered simulation scenarios virtually all evaluated novel methods provide more adequate estimates of the treatment effect for selected subgroups, in terms of bias, MSE and confidence interval coverage.",2016,arXiv: Computation
"Land as Gold, Land as Power: Urban Land Management and Popular Resistance in Municipal Politics in Burkina Faso","Burkina Faso is in the midst of economic and social transformations with respect to land and power. On the basis of ongoing research on local democratic culture, I discuss urban land management, and popular resistance in municipal politics in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. Notions of mobility and fixity are important dimensions for understanding the multiple connotations of urban land at the outskirts of towns and cities. Urban land management (lotissement) operations â€“ with the twofold purpose of regulating land tenure and of improving socio-economic and infrastructural conditions â€“ are at the core of social contests and political mobilizations in Bobo-Dioulasso. And, yet, most people are profoundly ambivalent to urban land management. On the one hand, urban land management operations are associated with corruption and embezzlement by local power-holders and other big men, and popular resistance and public protest are common. On the other hand, most people support the idea of implementing urban land management in their neighborhood so as to develop the area, and to, hopefully, get access to a land-plot of oneâ€™s own (un chez-soi). In practice, however, for most people urban land management entails displacement and moving away from the neighborhood.Hence, urban land simultaneously represents gold (in the sense of volatile, short-term wealth and of steady, long-term value), and power (individual and collective, political and economic, cultural and social). By exploring urban land management operations, and popular resistance and protest, the paper demonstrates that municipal politics is a prism through which mobility and fixity can be fruitfully explored",2013,

"The Generalized Monotone Incremental Forward Stagewise Method for Modeling Longitudinal, Clustered, and Overdispersed Count Data: Application Predicting Nuclear Bud and Micronuclei Frequencies","THE GENERALIZED MONOTONE INCREMENTAL FORWARD STAGEWISE METHOD FOR MODELING LONGITUDINAL, CLUSTERED, AND OVERDISPERSED COUNT DATA: APPLICATION PREDICTING NUCLEAR BUD AND MICRONUCLEI FREQUENCIES By Rebecca R. Lehman A dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Virginia Commonwealth University. Virginia Commonwealth University, 2017. Director: Kellie J. Archer, Ph.D., Chair and Professor, Division of Biostatistics, College of Public Health at The Ohio State University With the influx of high-dimensional data there is an immediate need for statistical methods that are able to handle situations when the number of predictors greatly exceeds the number of samples. One such area of growth is in examining how environmental exposures to toxins impact the body long term. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay can measure the genotoxic effect of exposure as a count outcome. To investigate potential biomarkers, high-throughput assays that assess gene expression and methylation have been developed. It is of interest to identify biomarkers or molecular features that are associated with elevated micronuclei (MN) or nuclear bud (Nbud) frequency, measures of exposure to environmental toxins. Given our desire to model a count outcome (MN and Nbud frequency) using high-throughput genomic features as predictors, novel methods that can handle overxv parameterized models need development. Overdispersion, when the variance of a count outcome is larger than its mean, is frequently observed with count response data. For situations where overdispersion is present, the negative binomial distribution is more appropriate. Furthermore, we expand the method to the longitudinal Poisson and longitudinal negative binomial settings for modeling a longitudinal or clustered outcome both when there is equidispersion and overdispersion. The method we have chosen to expand is the Generalized Monotone Incremental Forward Stagewise (GMIFS) method. We extend the GMIFS to the negative binomial distribution so it may be used to analyze a count outcome when both a high-dimensional predictor space and overdispersion are present. Our methods were compared to glmpath. We also extend the GMIFS to the longitudinal Poisson and longitudinal negative binomial distribution for analyzing a longitudinal outcome. Our methods were compared to glmmLasso and GLMMLasso. The developed methods were used to analyze two datasets, one from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study and one from the breast cancer epigenomic study conducted by researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University. In both studies a count outcome measured exposure to potential genotoxins and either gene expression or high-throughput methylation data formed a high dimensional predictor space. Further, the breast cancer study was longitudinal such that outcomes and high-dimensional genomic features were collected at multiple time points during the study for each patient. Our goal is to identify biomarkers that are associated with elevated MN or NBud frequency. From the development of these methods, we hope to make available more comprehensive statistical models for analyzing count outcomes with high dimensional predictor spaces and either cross-sectional or longitudinal study designs.",2017,

"Athalassotoga saccharophila gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from an acidic terrestrial hot spring, and proposal of Mesoaciditogales ord. nov. and Mesoaciditogaceae fam. nov. in the phylum Thermotogae.","A novel moderately thermophilic, weakly acidophilic, heterotrophic, anaerobic, short-rod bacterium having an outer sheath-like structure (toga) was isolated from a low-salt acidic terrestrial hot spring in Oku-Shiobara, Tochigi, Japan. The strain, designated NAS-01T, grew between 30 and 60â€‰Â°C (optimum 55â€‰Â°C), and at pHâ€‰4.5 and 7.5 (optimum pHâ€‰5.5 to 6.0) and could not grow in media with â‰¥â€‰1â€‰% NaCl (optimum 0â€‰% NaCl). It utilized Fe(III), thiosulfate or l-cystine as electron acceptor for growth, and yeast extract, peptone or a variety of sugars as carbon and energy sources. The major cellular fatty acid was C16â€‰:â€‰0, and no lipoquinone was detected. Strain NAS-01T contained phospholipids and glycolipids, but not aminolipids. The DNA G+C content was 41.1â€Šmol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the strain was included in the phylum Thermotogae, and was closely related to Mesoaciditoga lauensis. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between them was 90â€‰%, and they were deeply branched off the rest of the known Thermotogae species. On the basis of the phylogenetic and ecophysiological properties, strain NAS-01T represents a novel species of a new genus in the phylum Thermotogae, for which we propose the name Athalassotoga saccharophila gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of the type species is NAS-01T (â€‰=â€‰JCM 19762Tâ€‰=â€‰DSM 28954T).

Impact of non-cardiovascular disease burden on thirty-day hospital readmission in heart failure patients.,"BACKGROUND
Little is known about the impact of non-cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden on 30- -day readmission in heart failure (HF) patients. The aim of the study was to assess the role of non-CVD burden on 30-day readmission in HF patients. \ METHODS: We analyzed the effect of non-CVD burden by frequency of ICD-9 code categories on readmis-sions of patients discharged with a primary diagnosis of HF. We first modeled the probability of readmis-sion within 30 days as a function of demographic and clinical covariates in a randomly selected training dataset of the total cohort. Variable selection was carried out using a bootstrap LASSO procedure with 1000 bootstrap samples, the final model was tested on a validation dataset. Adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals were reported in the validation dataset.


RESULTS
There were a total of 6228 HF hospitalizations, 1523 (24%) with readmission within 30 days of discharge. The strongest predictor for 30-day readmissions was any hospital admission in the prior year (p < 0.001). Cardiovascular risk factors did not enter the final model. However, digestive system diseases increased the risk for readmission by 17% for each diagnosis (p = 0.046), while respiratory diseases and genitourinary diseases showed a trend toward a higher risk of readmission (p = 0.07 and p = 0.09, respectively). Non-CVDs out-competed cardiovascular covariates previously reported to predict readmission.


CONCLUSIONS
In patients with HF hospitalization, prior admissions predicted 30-day readmission. Diseases of the digestive system also increase 30-day readmission rates. Assessment of non-CVD burden in HF patients could serve as an important risk marker for 30-day readmissions.",2018,Cardiology journal
PCR analysis and spatial repartition of trypanosomes infecting tsetse flies in SidÃ©radougou area of Burkina Faso.,"A parasitological and entomological survey was conducted in the Sideradougou area (south of Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso) in order to identify transmission factors of African trypanosomosis. A total of 3600 tsetse flies (Glossina tachinoides, Glossina palpalis gambiensis) were captured along 120 km of linear gallery forest and half of them were dissected. PCR analysis was undertaken on parasitologically positive flies (161 G. tachinoides, 92 G. palpalis gambiensis) to characterize the different trypanosomes. All the results were integrated in a GIS (Geographical Information System). Spatial repartition of the characterized trypanosomes enabled to recognize different areas with specific patterns of infection. Relations with environmental factors are discussed.",1998,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
Creating Political Nation: Vyacheslav Lypynsky and His Conservative Theory of 1920s,"The paper analyses the worldviews of Vyacheslav (Vaclav) Lypynsky, (1882-1931), who was an outstanding intellectual of Ukrainian conservative thought of the 1900-1930â€™s. Particular attention is paid to his views of the 1920â€™s when he completed the construction of his theory, and revised his earlier writings. Under the influence of the early sociological writings of Vilfredo Parto and Robert Michels, he developed a typology of the origins of aristocracy and corresponding types of state and society, these being classocratic, ochlocratic, and democratic. The paper looks at the similarities of Lypynskyâ€™s views compared with some approaches typical of â€œconservative revolutionâ€. Lypynskyâ€™s argument is transitional, and comes from the necessity to reflect upon and respond to the core transformations of European societies as a result of, and post World War One. He completely rejected borrowing methods and attitudes of â€œmass politicsâ€ and use them in conservatism. In defining the term â€œnationâ€, Lypynsky consistently kept the framework of its political interpretation. At the same time, he understood that the Ukrainian national project was feasible only as political and anti-colonial (as in the USA). Thus, he tried to fit his understanding of â€˜nationâ€™ within monarchism and legitimism. Overall, Lypynskyâ€™s ideas are far removed from any restorative intentions. It was a question of how to â€œrestore the pastâ€, since he was critical of the pre-World War One and pre-revolutionary status quo. He remained critical of this status quo when it was destroyed, and did not idealize it. The question is, however, if a new political action is possible, and if a new political order based on conservative ideas can be achieved.",2014,The Russian Sociological Review
Normalization by realizability also evaluates,"For those of us that generally live in the world of syntax, semantic 
proof methods such as realizability or logical relations / 
parametricity sometimes feel like magic. Why do they work? At which 
point in the proof is ""the real work"" done? 
 
Bernardy and Lasson express realizability and parametricity models as 
syntactic model -- but the abstraction/adequacy theorems are still 
explained as meta-level proofs. Hoping to better understand the proof 
technique, we look at those theorems as programs themselves. How does 
a normalization proof using realizability actually computes those 
normal forms? 
 
This detective work is an early stage and we propose a first attempt 
in a simple setting. Instead of arbitrary Pure Type Systems, we use 
the minimal negative propositional logic (arrows only). Instead of 
starting from the simply-typed lambda-calculus, we work on 
sequent-style terms in a simple subset of the Curien-Herbelin 
L calculus.",2015,
Network-Based Inference Framework for Identifying Cancer Genes from Gene Expression Data,"Great efforts have been devoted to alleviate uncertainty of detected cancer genes as accurate identification of oncogenes is of tremendous significance and helps unravel the biological behavior of tumors. In this paper, we present a differential network-based framework to detect biologically meaningful cancer-related genes. Firstly, a gene regulatory network construction algorithm is proposed, in which a boosting regression based on likelihood score and informative prior is employed for improving accuracy of identification. Secondly, with the algorithm, two gene regulatory networks are constructed from case and control samples independently. Thirdly, by subtracting the two networks, a differential-network model is obtained and then used to rank differentially expressed hub genes for identification of cancer biomarkers. Compared with two existing gene-based methods (t-test and lasso), the method has a significant improvement in accuracy both on synthetic datasets and two real breast cancer datasets. Furthermore, identified six genes (TSPYL5, CD55, CCNE2, DCK, BBC3, and MUC1) susceptible to breast cancer were verified through the literature mining, GO analysis, and pathway functional enrichment analysis. Among these oncogenes, TSPYL5 and CCNE2 have been already known as prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer, CD55 has been suspected of playing an important role in breast cancer prognosis from literature evidence, and other three genes are newly discovered breast cancer biomarkers. More generally, the differential-network schema can be extended to other complex diseases for detection of disease associated-genes.",2013,BioMed Research International
regsem: Regularized Structural Equation Modeling,"The regsem package in R, an implementation of regularized structural equation modeling (RegSEM; Jacobucci, Grimm, and McArdle 2016), was recently developed with the goal of incorporating various forms of penalized likelihood estimation in a broad array of structural equations models. The forms of regularization include both the ridge (Hoerl and Kennard 1970) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso; Tibshirani 1996), along with sparser extensions. RegSEM is particularly useful for structural equation models that have a small parameter to sample size ratio, as the addition of penalties can reduce the complexity, thus reducing the bias of the parameter estimates. The paper covers the algorithmic details and an overview of the use of regsem with the application of both factor analysis and latent growth curve models.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
"Wide-Area Video Understanding: Tracking, Video Summarization and Algorithm-Platform Co-Design","Author(s): Zhang, Shu | Advisor(s): Roy-Chowdhury, Amit | Abstract: Analyzing scenes captured in video over wide areas, either in a single view or in multiple views, is the focus of this thesis. The thesis considers three inter-related problems in this domain - tracking in a network of cameras, summarization of the collected videos, and algorithm design that is robust to the physical conditions of the environment and the hardware platforms on which they are implemented. The inter-relationships between various objects in the scene (termed as context) are explored in the developed solution strategies.In this thesis, we explore the problems of multi-target tracking in a wide-area scene, where the context information is shown to effectively improve the results because of the target interactions. We present a context-aware multi-target tracking algorithm in an overlapping camera network. The proposed algorithm is able to track multiple interacting targets in a wide-area camera network. From observations that both individuals and groups of targets interact with each other in natural scenes, we develop a Switching Network Tracker (SNT) that tracks both individuals and groups. In addition, due to the lack of the availability of public non-overlapping camera network datasets, we propose a new camera network tracking dataset (CamNeT) with multiple challenges. A baseline algorithm where the context information is considered is provided along with the dataset.We also explore the video summarization problem. In a wide-area scene, most of the data is redundant. Therefore, we develop an algorithm, Context-Aware Video Summarization (CAVS) algorithm, that can capture the important video portions through information about individual local motion regions, as well as the interactions between these motion regions (context information). The summarization problem is then solved as the methodology of sparse coding with generalized sparse group lasso. Moreover, although complex algorithms have been developed, there are few methods considering the real applications when there is a performance constraint. We study this fundamental problem in computer vision, which is to co-design the algorithm-platform for an unknown dataset under certain performance constraints. Our algorithm calculates a similarity between a test video and each unique training scenario. Similarity between training and test dataset indicates the same algorithm-platform can be applied to both of them. We test our algorithm on two applications: pedestrian detection and tracking.We conclude the thesis by highlighting future research directions.",2015,
"Berechnung der Kosten
alkoholassoziierter Krankheiten","Zusammenfassung
Bei knapper werdenden finanziellen Ressourcen
ist es besonders wichtig zu wissen,welche
gesellschaftlichen Lasten durch Sucht zu tragen
sind. Mittels Humankapitalansatz wurden
die direkten und indirekten Kosten alkoholbezogener
Krankheiten in Deutschland fÃ¼r die
Mitte der 90er-Jahre berechnet. Danach wird
die Volkswirtschaft jÃ¤hrlich mit 40 Mrd.DM
durch alkoholassoziierte Krankheiten belastet.
Im Jahr 1995 sind dies 1,13% des Bruttosozialprodukts.
Von den indirekten Kosten mit
24 Mrd. DM entsteht der grÃ¶ÃŸte Ressourcenverlust
mit 14 Mrd. DM durch vorzeitige MortalitÃ¤t.
FrÃ¼hberentungen machen den zweithÃ¶chsten
Ressourcenverlust aus; es folgt die
ArbeitsunfÃ¤higkeit. Die direkten Kosten,
also der Ressourcenverbrauch,verursachen
15 Mrd. DM,fast 40% der Gesamtkosten.
Von diesen sind die Krankenhausbehandlung,
die vorbeugenden und betreuenden MaÃŸnahmen
und die ambulante Behandlung die
Hauptpositionen. MÃ¤nner sind fÃ¼r den erheblichen
Teil der Kosten verantwortlich,da sie
nicht nur hÃ¤ufiger ein riskantes und gefÃ¤hrliches
Trinkverhalten zeigen,sondern auch
Ã¼ber ein durchschnittlich hÃ¶heres Einkommen
verfÃ¼gen. Sogar fÃ¼r die direkten Kosten wie
bei der Rehabilitation werden fÃ¼r MÃ¤nner pro
stationÃ¤rer Rehabilitationsleistung mehr Mittel
eingesetzt als fÃ¼r Frauen. Altersgruppenspezifische
Auswertungen zu MortalitÃ¤t und
MorbiditÃ¤t zeigen auf, dass der Schwerpunkt
bei Konsumenten im mittleren Lebensalter
liegt. Schon fÃ¼r die jÃ¼ngere BevÃ¶lkerung muss
mit gravierenden gesundheitlichen und wirtschaftlichen
Folgen gerechnet werden.Abstract
In view of limited financial resources, it is
highly important to know the economic impact
of addiction. The direct and indirect
costs of alcohol-related diseases in Germany
during the mid-1990s have been calculated
using the human capital approach. The national
economy is burdened with 40 billion
Deutsch Marks (DM) due to alcohol-related
diseases. In 1995, this represented 1.13% of
the gross national product. Of the total indirect
costs, amounting to 24 billion DM, the
greatest loss of resources, i.e. 14 billion DM,
arises from the 42,000 premature deaths due
to alcohol-related diseases. Early retirement
account for the second highest loss of resources,
followed by inability to work. Direct
costs, i.e. the consumption of resources,
account for 15 billion DM of the overall costs
(40%). Hospital treatment, preventive and
assisting measures, and outpatient treatment
are the main sources of direct costs.
The major part of the costs is incurred by
men, because they not only have a more risky
and more dangerous drinking behaviour,
but usually have a higher income than
women. Even for direct costs, such as costs of
rehabilitation, more money per case has also
been spent for men than for women. Agespecific
analyses have shown that middleaged
consumers have the highest mortality
and morbidity risk, but severe health and
economic consequences have also been

Diagnosing Problems of Distribution-Free Multivariate Control Chart,"In order to solve the problem of only have a few historical data that can be used in multivariate process monitoring, a new distribution-free multivariate control chart has been proposed. And in the control chart structure the control limits are determined on-line with the future observations and the historical data. Therefore, the proposed control chart has very important application in practice. However, the research doesnâ€™t study the problem of the fault diagnosis after the control chart alarms. So we use LASSO-based diagnostic framework to identify when a detected shift has occurred and to isolate the shifted components.",2014,Advanced Materials Research
A robust â„“1 penalized DOA estimator,"The SPS-LASSO has recently been introduced as a solution to the problem of regularization parameter selection in the complex-valued LASSO problem. Still, the dependence on the grid size and the polynomial time of performing convex optimization technique in each iteration, in addition to the deficiencies in the low noise regime, confines its performance for Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. This work presents methods to apply LASSO without grid size limitation and with less complexity. As we show by simulations, the proposed methods loose a negligible performance compared to the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator, which needs a combinatorial search We also show by simulations that compared to practical implementations of ML, the proposed techniques are less sensitive to the source power difference.",2012,"2012 Conference Record of the Forty Sixth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (ASILOMAR)"
Graphon estimation via nearest neighbor algorithm and 2D fused lasso denoising,"We propose a class of methods for graphon estimation based on exploiting connections with nonparametric regression. The idea is to construct an ordering of the nodes in the network, similar in spirit to Chan and Airoldi (2014). However, rather than only considering orderings based on the empirical degree as in Chan and Airoldi (2014), we use the nearest neighbor algorithm which is an approximating solution to the traveling salesman problem. This in turn can handle general distances $\hat{d}$ between the nodes, something that allows us to incorporate rich information of the network. Once an ordering is constructed, we formulate a 2D grid graph denoising problem that we solve through fused lasso regularization. For particular choices of the metric $\hat{d}$, we show that the corresponding two-step estimator can attain competitive rates when the true model is the stochastic block model, and when the underlying graphon is piecewise H\""{o}lder or it has bounded variation.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Coupled Biasâ€“Variance Tradeoff for Cross-Pose Face Recognition,"Subspace-based face representation can be looked as a regression problem. From this viewpoint, we first revisited the problem of recognizing faces across pose differences, which is a bottleneck in face recognition. Then, we propose a new approach for cross-pose face recognition using a regressor with a coupled bias-variance tradeoff. We found that striking a coupled balance between bias and variance in regression for different poses could improve the regressor-based cross-pose face representation, i.e., the regressor can be more stable against a pose difference. With the basic idea, ridge regression and lasso regression are explored. Experimental results on CMU PIE, the FERET, and the Multi-PIE face databases show that the proposed bias-variance tradeoff can achieve considerable reinforcement in recognition performance.",2012,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing
"Efficienza Energetica, Sicurezza Sismica e Dimensione Sociale nelle Addizioni di Facciata","Il contributo analizza alcune soluzioni progettuali in un caso di studio del progetto europeo Pro-GET-onE (Horizon 2020 G.A. n. 723747), il cui obiettivo Ã¨ quello di individuare un sistema di facciata per il miglioramento energetico, sismico ed architettonico. Tale sistema ambisce a configurarsi come il risultato di una integrazione tra struttura, estensioni spaziali, involucro e tecnologie impiantistiche integrate (GETs), finalizzate a raggiungere prestazioni energetiche eccellenti, fino ad avvicinarsi al consumo quasi zero (nZEB). Tali addizioni volumetriche sono studiate e categorizzate secondo un abaco di soluzioni diverse e personalizzabili (balconi, serre ed extra-room) in ragione delle diverse esigenze dellâ€™utenza. Il sistema di facciata Ã¨ stato analizzato sotto il profilo energetico attraverso simulazioni implementate con il software EnergyPlus v8.4. I risultati della prestazione energetica, del comfort, della qualitÃ  dell'aria, degli aspetti acustici e di illuminazione sono determinanti nel caso di una estensione di facciata come quella proposta dal sistema; in tale prospettiva, il contributo costituisce il punto di partenza per il confronto dei vari scenari di addizione, concentrandosi sulla riduzione dei carichi termici in regime estivo e invernale. Sotto il profilo strutturale, sono state effettuate modellazioni tramite software di calcolo agli elementi finiti SAP2000 v19.2.0 per le analisi dinamiche e statiche, al fine di valutare lâ€™aumento di rigidezza conferito dalla struttura esterna. I risultati dimostrano un incremento della capacitÃ  in termini di accelerazione di collasso a discapito di una riduzione di duttilitÃ  da imputare allo stesso sistema irrigidente.

The building model is defined by using the building energy simulation software, EnergyPlus v8.4, with the graphical definition of the geometry, dimensions and positions of the thermal envelope. The results of the aforementioned analysis are taken as a starting point for the comparison of various GET scenarios. In particular, different GET-systems, with different types of prefabricated walls, are taken into account. In this way, it is possible to evaluate the different hypothesized solutions, taking into account several outputs such as energy performance, comfort, space, lighting aspects, indoor air quality and acoustic aspects. From the structural point of view, a modelled analysis was performed using finite element calculation software SAP2000 v19.2.0 for dynamic and static analysis, in order to evaluate the increase in stiffness given by the external structure. The results demonstrate an increase in terms of acceleration of collapse despite a reduction in terms of ductility for the same irrigation system.",2018,
Anything is possible,"Philosophical speculation can regain determinate knowledge of absolute reality. We can think the nature of things as they are in themselves, independently of the way they appear to us. We can demonstrate that the modality of this nature is radically contingent â€“ that there is no reason for things or â€˜lawsâ€™ to be or remain as they are. Nothing is necessary, apart from the necessity that nothing be necessary. Anything can happen, in any place and at any time, without reason or cause. Such is the ringing message affirmed by the remarkable French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux in his first book, After Finitude, originally published by Seuil in 2006. Against the grain of self-critical and self-reflexive post-Kantian philosophy, Meillassoux announces that we can recover â€˜the great outdoors, the absolute outside of pre-critical thinkersâ€™, the utterly â€˜foreign territoryâ€™ that subsists in itself, independently of our relation to it. And when we begin to explore this foreign land that is reality in itself, what we learn is that",2011,
"The development of the genital ducts in Limnodriloidinae (Tubificidae, Clitellata)","The development of the male duct and spermatheca is studied in three species of the marine Limnodriloidinae (Tubificidae): Limnodriloides rubicundus ; Tectidrilus bori ; Thalassodrilides ineri . All tubificids are hermaphroditic with paired male ducts, female ducts and, as a rule, spermathecae. The male duct comprises a funnel, followed by a vas deferens, an atrium and, frequently, a copulatory structure. There may also be a diffuse or compact prostate gland in association with the male duct. In the three species studied, the funnel and vas deferens originate from peritoneal (mesodermal) cells in the posterior septa of the testes segment. The atrium develops from an invagination of the epidermis (ectoderm). The vas deferens and atrium subsequently connect to each other, and a continuous duct from the testes segment to the exterior is formed. The prostate gland originates from large peritoneal cells occurring in a delimited area on the outer surface of the atrium; other small peritoneal cells surrounding the whole atrium give rise to muscle fibres. The spermatheca develops from an invagination of the epidermis, and is thus of ectodermal origin. The morphology and position of the genital ducts have been and are important for the classification of the oligochaetes. However, different parts of the male duct have been named without regard to whether they are homologous or not. One way to establish stronger primary hypotheses of homology is to study the detailed morphology and/or the development of the genital ducts.",2002,Journal of Zoology
Radiomics analysis of DWI data to identify the rectal cancer patients qualified for local excision after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy,"The Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients were routinely treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) firstly and received total excision afterwards. While, the LARC patients might relieve to T1N0M0/T0N0M0 stage after the CRT, which would enable the patients be qualified for local excision. However, accurate pathological TNM stage could only be obtained by the pathological examination after surgery. We aimed to conduct a Radiomics analysis of Diffusion weighted Imaging (DWI) data to identify the patients in T1N0M0/T0N0M0 stages before surgery, in hope of providing clinical surgery decision support. 223 routinely treated LARC patients in Beijing Cancer Hospital were enrolled in current study. DWI data and clinical characteristics were collected after CRT. According to the pathological TNM stage, the patients of T1N0M0 and T0N0M0 stages were labelled as 1 and the other patients were labelled as 0. The first 123 patients in chronological order were used as training set, and the rest patients as validation set. 563 image features extracted from the DWI data and clinical characteristics were used as features. Two-sample T test was conducted to pre-select the top 50% discriminating features. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso)-Logistic regression model was conducted to further select features and construct the classification model. Based on the 14 selected image features, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.8781, classification Accuracy (ACC) of 0.8432 were achieved in the training set. In the validation set, AUC of 0.8707, ACC (ACC) of 0.84 were observed.",2018,
Multilevel Gaussian graphical model for multilevel networks,"Abstract Gaussian graphical models have become a popular tool to represent networks among variables such as genes. They use the conditional correlations from the joint distribution to describe the dependencies between gene pairs, and employ the precision matrix of the genes. Because of the sparse nature of the gene networks and small sample sizes in high dimensional genetic data, regularization approaches attracted much attention in aim at obtaining the shrinkage estimates of the precision matrix. However, existing methods have been focused on the Gaussian graphical model among genes; that is, they are only applicable to a single level Gaussian graphical model. It is known that pathways are not independent of each other because of shared genes and interactions among pathways. Developing multipathway analysis has been a challenging problem because of the complex dependence structure among pathways. By considering the dependency among pathways as well as the genes within each pathway, we propose a multilevel Gaussian graphical model (MGGM) in which one level describes the networks for genes and the other for pathways. We have developed a multilevel L1 penalized likelihood approach to achieve the sparseness on both levels. In addition, we have developed an iterative weighted graphical LASSO algorithm for MGGM. Our simulation results supported the advantages of our approach; our method estimated the network more accurately on the pathway level and sparser on the gene level. We also demonstrated the usefulness of our approach using a canine genes-pathways data set.",2017,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference
Product Antimagic Labelings in Cayley Digraphs of 2-generated 2-groups,"1. IntroductionThe concept of graph labeling was introduced by Rosa in 1967 [9]. A graphlabeling is an assignment of integers to the vertices or edges or both, subject tocertain conditions. Labeled graphs serve as useful models for a broad range ofapplications such as coding theory, X-ray crystallography, radar, astronomy, cir-cuit design, communication network addressing and data base management [5].Hence in the intervening years various labeling of graphs such as graceful label-ing, harmonious labeling, magic labeling, antimagic labeling, bimagic labeling,prime labeling, cordial labeling, mean labeling, arithmetic labeling etc., havebeen studied in over 1100 papers [5]. In [3], antimagic labelings for certain classof graphs were studied. In [6], Hartsï¬‚eld and Ringel made a conjecture on vertex-antimagic labeling and Martin Baca possed a conjecture about edge-antimagicvertex labeling [8]. Figueroa-Centeno and others have introduced multiplicativeanalogs of magic and antimagic labelings [4]. They deï¬‚ne a graph",2012,Journal of applied mathematics & informatics
A visual survey of the inshore fish communities of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands).,"An in situ visual survey technique (5 minutes and 100 m area) was used to assess the inshore fishes off Gran Canaria. In 1996, 211 visual surveys were conducted at 7 localities. Locations differed significantly among each other with regards to the number of species per survey (ANOVA: p < 0.01). The five most abundant species were Chromis limbatus, Boops boops, Pomadasys incisus, Abudefduf luridus, and Thalassoma pavo with respective mean abundances of 65.6, 37.4, 16.7, 8.7, and 4.5 per 100 m. Detrended Correspondence Analysis, a multivariate ordination technique showed that the major determinant of community structure is substrate type. The majority of the surveyed species had low axis 1 ordination scores indicating a strong association with a hard substrate. The step-wise linear regression models explained 45.3 % and 1 1.4% of the variation in the first and second axis survey ordination scores, respectively.",2001,
The Sulfate-Rich and Extreme Saline Sediment of the Ephemeral Tirez Lagoon: A Biotope for Acetoclastic Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria and Hydrogenotrophic Methanogenic Archaea,"Our goal was to examine the composition of methanogenic archaea (MA) and sulfate-reducing (SRP) and sulfur-oxidizing (SOP) prokaryotes in the extreme athalassohaline and particularly sulfate-rich sediment of Tirez Lagoon (Spain). Thus, adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (APS) reductase Î± (aprA) and methyl coenzyme M reductase Î± (mcrA) gene markers were amplified given that both enzymes are specific for SRP, SOP, and MA, respectively. Anaerobic populations sampled at different depths in flooded and dry seasons from the anoxic sediment were compared qualitatively via denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprint analysis. Phylogenetic analyses allowed the detection of SRP belonging to Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfohalobiaceae, and Peptococcaceae in âˆ‚-proteobacteria and Firmicutes and SOP belonging to Chromatiales/Thiotrichales clade and Ectothiorhodospiraceae in Î³-proteobacteria as well as MA belonging to methylotrophic species in Methanosarcinaceae and one hydrogenotrophic species in Methanomicrobiaceae. We also estimated amino acid composition, GC content, and preferential codon usage for the AprA and McrA sequences from halophiles, nonhalophiles, and Tirez phylotypes. Even though our results cannot be currently conclusive regarding the halotolerant strategies carried out by Tirez phylotypes, we discuss the possibility of a plausible ""salt-in"" signal in SRP and SOP as well as of a speculative complementary haloadaptation between salt-in and salt-out strategies in MA.",2011,International Journal of Microbiology
Variable Selection for Cox's proportional Hazards Model and Frailty Model,"A class of variable selection procedures for parametric models via nonconcave penalized likelihood was proposed in Fan and Li (2001a). It has been shown there that the resulting procedures perform as well as if the subset of significant variables were known in advance. Such a property is called an oracle property. The proposed procedures were illustrated in the context of linear regression, robust linear regression and generalized linear models. In this paper, the nonconcave penalized likelihood approach is extended further to the Cox proportional hazards model and the Cox proportional hazards frailty model, two commonly used semi-parametric models in survival analysis. As a result, new variable selection procedures for these two commonly-used models are proposed. It is demonstrated how the rates of convergence depend on the regularization parameter in the penalty function. Further, with a proper choice of the regularization parameter and the penalty function, the proposed estimators possess an oracle property. Standard error formulae are derived and their accuracies are empirically tested. Simulation studies show that the proposed procedures are more stable in prediction and more effective in computation than the best subset variable selection, and they reduce model complexity as effectively as the best subset variable selection. Compared with the LASSO, which is the penalized likelihood method with the L 1 -penalty, proposed by Tibshirani, the newly proposed approaches have better theoretic properties and finite sample performance.",2002,Annals of Statistics
Alfonso Fontanelliâ€™s Cadences and the Seconda Pratica,"In his brilliant studies and accurate editions Anthony Newcomb has shown Alfonso Fontanelliâ€™s contributions to the definition of â€œthe new Ferrarese style of the 1590sâ€ and, therefore, to the birth of the seconda pratica. My article focuses on a specific aspect of Fontanelliâ€™s polyphonic writing: the handling of cadences for not only syntactical and tonally structural but also expressive purposes. The literary-musical analyses of some of the most representative settings published in Fontanelliâ€™s two books of madrigals (1595 and 1604)â€”including masterpieces such as â€œTu miri, o vago ed amoroso fioreâ€ (Anonymous), â€œIo piango, ed ella il voltoâ€ (Petrarca), â€œLasso, non odo piu Filli mia caraâ€ (Anonymous), and â€œDovro dunque morireâ€ (Rinuccini)â€”shows, above all, the unusually wide range of Fontanelliâ€™s cadential palette. He used not only traditional models (such as the perfect, authentic, Phrygian, and half cadences) but also a great variety of alternative solutions (including what Newcomb has named â€œevaporatedâ€ and â€œobliqueâ€ cadences) that are often so experimental and bold as to escape rigid classification. In the context of a basically chromatic, dissonant, harmonically restless, and tonally unfocused polyphonic flow such cadential variety seems to reflect Fontanelliâ€™s intention not only to underscore the conceptual and emotional meanings represented in the verbal text but also to sharpen their large-scale affective contrasts. In these and other experimental traits of his â€œcadential styleâ€ Fontanelli further developed (possibly through the mediation of Jacques de Wert, and also under the influence of composers such as Luzzaschi and Gesualdo) those basic compositional techniques and exegetic principles that Cipriano de Rore, the real father of the seconda pratica, had already established in his later madrigals, and that Vincenzo Galilei, in turn, had neatly codified in his treatise on counterpoint (ca. 1588â€“1591).",2013,The Journal of Musicology
Distributed soft thresholding for sparse signal recovery,"In this paper, we address the problem of distributed sparse recovery of signals acquired via compressed measurements in a sensor network. We propose a new class of distributed algorithms to solve Lasso regression problems, when the communication to a fusion center is not possible, e.g., due to communication cost or privacy reasons. More precisely, we introduce a distributed iterative soft thresholding algorithm (DISTA) that consists of three steps: an averaging step, a gradient step, and a soft thresholding operation. We prove the convergence of DISTA in networks represented by regular graphs, and we compare it with existing methods in terms of performance, memory, and complexity.",2013,2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)
"Long-term changes in seagrass coverage and potential links to climate-related factors: the case of Inhambane Bay, southern Mozambique","Changes in seagrass coverage in Inhambane Bay (southern Mozambique) from 1992 to 2013 were assessed using SPOT 5 and Landsat imagery mapping methods with support of extensive groundtruthing. Over a 21-year period, the total seagrass area was reduced from 12,076 ha to 6,199 ha (51% of the original area). 2001 was the year when seagrass occupied the smallest area in Inhambane Bay with 5,641 ha, apparently related to the impacts of tropical Cyclone Eline with winds of around 200 km/h, and lasting for 29 days with widespread damage on human and natural infrastructure, However, a steady seagrass recovery was observed between 2001 and 2004, where 958 ha of seagrass was restored naturally. Eight seagrass species occur in Inhambane Bay forming six seagrass community types. The three largest communities were Thalassia hemprichii/Halodule uninervis with 2,305.5 ha, followed by Thalassodendron ciliatum/Cymodocea serrulata with 2,280.3 ha, and Halodule uninervis with 1,393.9 ha. The loss of seagrass occurred mainly in the T . hemprichii/H . uninervis and H. uninervis communities. A specific study on T. hemprichii conducted at Barra Peninsula and Ilha dos Porcos showed that the total seagrass biomass varied between 947.08 Â± 31.09 g DWm-2 and 1636.82 Â± 80.52 g DWm -2 , respectively, being low at Barra Peninsula, where seagrass meadows have lower shoot density and appear to be more exposed to climate-related events such as cyclones compared to Ilha dos Porcos. This monitoring method creates a basis for better management and conservation, and a continuation of these types of evaluation actions to predict trends and impacts on marine habitats are recommended.",2017,Western Indian Ocean journal of marine science

A Projection Neural Network for the Generalized Lasso.,"The generalized lasso (GLasso) is an extension of the lasso regression in which there is an lâ‚ penalty term (or regularization) of the linearly transformed coefficient vector. Finding the optimal solution of GLasso is not straightforward since the penalty term is not differentiable. This brief presents a novel one-layer neural network to solve the generalized lasso for a wide range of penalty transformation matrices. The proposed neural network is proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov and converges globally to the optimal solution of the GLasso. It is also shown that the proposed neural solution can solve many optimization problems, including sparse and weighted sparse representations, (weighted) total variation denoising, fused lasso signal approximator, and trend filtering. Disparate experiments on the above problems illustrate and confirm the excellent performance of the proposed neural network in comparison to other competing techniques.",2019,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems
Critical evaluation of web-based prediction tools for human protein subcellular localization.,"Human protein subcellular localization has an important research value in biological processes, also in elucidating protein functions and identifying drug targets. Over the past decade, a number of protein subcellular localization prediction tools have been designed and made freely available online. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the progress of research on the subcellular localization of human proteins in recent years, including commonly used data sets proposed by the predecessors and the performance of all selected prediction tools against the same benchmark data set. We carry out a systematic evaluation of several publicly available subcellular localization prediction methods on various benchmark data sets. Among them, we find that mLASSO-Hum and pLoc-mHum provide a statistically significant improvement in performance, as measured by the value of accuracy, relative to the other methods. Meanwhile, we build a new data set using the latest version of Uniprot database and construct a new GO-based prediction method HumLoc-LBCI in this paper. Then, we test all selected prediction tools on the new data set. Finally, we discuss the possible development directions of human protein subcellular localization.

Pagtukoy at Pagpapakahulugan sa mga Akdang Maritimo sa Pilipinas: Mga Makabuluhang Katangian at Kaugnay na Usapin,"Abstrak Sa artikulo, isinusulong na sa pagturing sa Panitikang Maritimo bilang nagsasariling domeyn sa Panitikan, mas mapalilitaw ang mga katangian at kakanyahang makabuluhan sa Pilipinong kultura at pagkakakilanlan. Sa ganitong konteksto, mahalagang magkaroon ng lente sa panunuring pampanitikan na idinisenyo at iniangkop sa mga gawaing kaugnay ng dagat. Gayunman, kinaharap sa proseso ng pananaliksik ang dalawang matitingkad na suliranin: (1) May kakulangan sa sistematiko at komprehensibong dokumentasyon ng mga akdang maritimo at (2) walang malinaw at eksplisit na pagpapakahulugan sa Panitikang Maritimo ng Pilipinas. Upang makabuluhang masuri ang maritimo bilang domeyn, isinagawa muna ang pagtukoy sa mga akdang maaaring kumatawan dito. Ang papel na ito ay pagbabahagi ng mga naranasang kompleksiti sa seleksiyon at kategorisasyon ng mga malikhaing teksto. Taliwas sa inisyal na pananaw, hindi makasasapat ang simpleng paglahok sa dagat upang maituring na â€œmaritimoâ€ ang isang akda. Kaugnay nito, ibinabahagi ang importanteng mga katangian at usaping lumabas sa panunuri ng mga piling nobela at maikling kuwento.

Mga Susing Salita: Panitikang Maritimo, Anyong Pampanitikan, Pampanitikang Domeyn, Talasograpiya, Dagat, Tekstong Maritimo Abstract The article argues that by categorizing the oceanic texts as a separate literary domain, the maritime Filipino character and significance can effectively come forth. In this context, there is a need to formulate frameworks and modes of knowing that are designed for the purpose of understanding the sea. However, in the process of developing the research, two major difficulties were encountered: (1) The lack of systematic and comprehensive documentation of maritime texts and (2) the absence of clear and explicit definition of Maritime Literature in the Philippines. In order to effectively develop the maritime as a literary domain, it is essential to identify the creative works first. Contrary to my initial belief, it appears that the mere presence of the sea in the text will not suffice for it to be considered â€œmaritime.â€ The paper shares the complexity of selection and categorization encountered in analyzing selected novels and short stories. It explains some of the important features found in the texts and related concerns that may contribute to a more relevant definition of Maritime Literature in the Philippines.
