Statistical Inference for Structured High-dimensional Models 593,"High-dimensional statistical inference is a newly emerged direction of statistical science in the 21 century. Its importance is due to the increasing dimensionality and complexity of models needed to process and understand the modern real world data. The main idea making possible meaningful inference about such models is to assume suitable lower dimensional underlying structure or low-dimensional approximations, for which the error can be reasonably controlled. Several types of such structures have been recently introduced including sparse high-dimensional regression, sparse and/or low rank matrix models, matrix completion models, dictionary learning, network models (stochastic block model, mixed membership models) and more. The workshop focused on recent developments in structured sequence and regression models, matrix and tensor estimation, robustness, statistical learning in complex settings, network data, and topic models. Mathematics Subject Classification (2010): 62Gxx (in particular, 62G05, 62G08, 62G10). Introduction by the Organisers The workshop Statistical Inference for Structured High-Dimensional Models, organized by Anatoli Juditsky (UniversitÃ© Grenoble-Alpes), Alexandre Tsybakov (CREST, ENSAE), and Cun-Hui Zhang (Rutgers University), was held March 11th â€“ March 17th, 2018. The workshop aimed to highlight recent achievements in high-dimensional inference for structured statistical models based on the interplay of techniques from mathematical statistics, optimization theory and highdimensional probability, and to bring together researchers to exchange the ideas and to explore open mathematical problems. These goals were largely achieved. 592 Oberwolfach Report 12/2018 The workshop was well attended by 52 participants with broad geographic representation from three continents.

Abstracts from the 2017â€“2018 Mineral Deposits Studies Group meeting,"Abstracts from the 2017â€“2018 Mineral Deposits Studies Group meetings from the 2017â€“2018 Mineral Deposits Studies Group meeting Cobalt recovery from Katanga ores (DRC): the importance of mineralogical evaluation L. Santoro, St. Tshipeng Yav, E. Pirard and A. Kaniki Natural History Museum (l.santoro@nhm.ac.uk); University of Lubumbashi (Tshipeng@sgs.com); University of Liege (eric.pirard@ulg.ac. be) ABSTRACT Cobalt in the Congolese Copperbelt mines is commonly recovered from Co-oxi-hydroxides (i.e. heterogenite, asbolane) by acid-leaching under reducing conditions. However, most operations face a limit in the leaching yields of cobalt, which usually do not exceed 80%. The main aim of this work was to investigate the causes of the poor recovery, in order to reconcile the Co recovery with processing techniques. Several concentrate samples from different mine plants of Katanga Copperbelt (Kalukuluku, Mutanda, Mabaya, Kamwali and Fungurume) were selected and subjected to a full mineralogical characterisation by Optical Microscopy (OM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), automated mineralogy and Scanning Electron Microscopy by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) prior and after leaching tests. OM and XRD results were used as background information to build a mineral list for mineral identification during automated mineralogy analyses by Mineralogic Mining System (Zeiss ltd.). Automated mineralogy allowed obtaining mineral maps, modal mineralogy, chemical assays and Co deportment for each specimen prior and after leaching. Mineral maps of the leached samples were useful to observe the occurrences of poorly leached Co-bearing particles which were further investigated by SEM-EDS and X-mapping. The results showed that heterogenite (rarely associated with asbolane) is the main cobalt mineral in Katanga. Mineralogic Mining System was able to discriminate between pure heterogenite, and Si-Al-K-bearing heterogenite, asbolane/heterogenite, Heterogenite+Fe-oxi-hydroxide and Co-bearing mixed phases, which resulted more refractory to leaching. The comparison between modal mineralogy of preand post-leached samples indicates a decrease, but not a full leaching of these Co phases: chemical assays and Codeportment, in fact, still reveal the presence of low Co% within Co phases listed above (Table 1). SEM-EDS and Xmapping on single particles of some specimens corroborated the results obtained by Mineralogic.Cobalt in the Congolese Copperbelt mines is commonly recovered from Co-oxi-hydroxides (i.e. heterogenite, asbolane) by acid-leaching under reducing conditions.

The poor recovery of cobalt was ascribed to the mineralogical complexity making the routine processing strategy poorly effective. More attention must hence be placed during the processing stages of Co-ores, in order to avoid inappropriate leaching conditions, inappropriate pulp density and liberation issues caused by the occurrence of Co-bearing phases refractory to leaching treatments.

Sparse precision matrices for minimum variance portfolios,"Financial crises are typically characterized by highly positively correlated asset returns due to the simultaneous distress on almost all securities, high volatilities and the presence of extreme returns. In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, investors were prompted even further to look for portfolios that minimize risk and can better deal with estimation error in the inputs of the asset allocation models. The minimum variance portfolio Ã  la Markowitz is considered the reference model for risk minimization in equity markets, due to its simplicity in the optimization as well as its need for just one input estimate: the inverse of the covariance estimate, or the so-called precision matrix. In this paper, we propose a data-driven portfolio framework based on two regularization methods, glasso and tlasso, that provide sparse estimates of the precision matrix by penalizing its $$L_1$$L1-norm. Glasso and tlasso rely on asset returns Gaussianity or t-Student assumptions, respectively. Simulation and real-world data results support the proposed methods compared to state-of-art approaches, such as random matrix and Ledoitâ€“Wolf shrinkage.",2019,Computational Management Science
Asymptotic Analysis of Complex LASSO via Complex Approximate Message Passing (CAMP),"Recovering a sparse signal from an undersampled set of random linear measurements is the main problem of interest in compressed sensing. In this paper, we consider the case where both the signal and the measurements are complex-valued. We study the popular recovery method of l1-regularized least squares or LASSO. While several studies have shown that LASSO provides desirable solutions under certain conditions, the precise asymptotic performance of this algorithm in the complex setting is not yet known. In this paper, we extend the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm to solve the complex-valued LASSO problem and obtain the complex approximate message passing algorithm (CAMP). We then generalize the state evolution framework recently introduced for the analysis of AMP to the complex setting. Using the state evolution, we derive accurate formulas for the phase transition and noise sensitivity of both LASSO and CAMP. Our theoretical results are concerned with the case of i.i.d. Gaussian sensing matrices. Simulations confirm that our results hold for a larger class of random matrices.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
Nomogram based on shear-wave elastography radiomics can improve preoperative cervical lymph node staging for papillary thyroid carcinoma.,"Background Accurate preoperative prediction of cervical lymph node (LN) metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) provide a basis for surgical decision making and the extent of tumor resection. This study aimed to develop and validate an ultrasound radiomics nomogram for the preoperative assessment of LN status. Methods Data from 147 PTC patients at the Wuhan Tongji Hospital and 90 cases at the Hunan Provincial Tumor Hospital between January 2017 and September 2019 were included in our study. They were grouped as training and external validation set. Radiomics features were extracted from shear-wave elastography (SWE) images and corresponding B-mode ultrasound (BMUS) images. Then, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to select LN status-related features and construct the SWE and BMUS radiomics score (Rad-score). Multivariate logistic regression was performed using the two radiomics scores together with clinical data, and a nomogram was subsequently developed. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness in the training and external validation set. Results Both the SWE and BMUS Rad-scores were signiï¬cantly higher in patients with cervical LN metastasis. Multivariate analysis indicated that SWE Rad-score, multifocality and US-reported LN status were independent risk factors associated with LN status. The radiomics nomogram, which incorporated the three variables showed good calibration and discrimination in the training set (AUC 0.851; 95% CI, 0.791-0.912) and the validation set (AUC 0.832; 95% CI, 0.749-0.916). The signiï¬cantly improved net reclassiï¬cation index (NRI) and integrated discriminatory improvement (IDI) demonstrated that SWE radiomics signature was a very useful marker to predict the LN metastasis in PTC. Decision curve analysis indicated that the SWE radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. Furthermore, the nomogram also showed favorable discriminatory efficacy in the US-reported LN negative (cN0) subgroup (AUC 0.812; 95% CI, 0.745-0.860). Conclusion The presented radiomics nomogram, which is based on the SWE radiomics signature, shows favorable predictive value for LN staging in patients with PTC.",2020,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association
The Loss Rank Criterion for Variable Selection in Linear Regression Analysis,".â€‚ Lasso and other regularization procedures are attractive methods for variable selection, subject to a proper choice of shrinkage parameter. Given a set of potential subsets produced by a regularization algorithm, a consistent model selection criterion is proposed to select the best one among this preselected set. The approach leads to a fast and efficient procedure for variable selection, especially in high-dimensional settings. Model selection consistency of the suggested criterion is proven when the number of covariates d is fixed. Simulation studies suggest that the criterion still enjoys model selection consistency when d is much larger than the sample size. The simulations also show that our approach for variable selection works surprisingly well in comparison with existing competitors. The method is also applied to a real data set.",2010,Scandinavian Journal of Statistics
Abstract P1-20-04: Advanced development of the MasSpec Pen technology to aid in breast cancer surgical margin evaluation and diagnosis during surgery,"Complete tumor removal during breast conserving surgery (BCS) remains a challenge for even the most experienced surgeons due to difficulties associated with detecting residual disease at the margin. Additionally, there is limited technology to evaluate resected tissue while the patient is under anesthesia. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been previously used for rapid molecular characterization of healthy and diseased tissue and has shown potential for intraoperative use. We have developed an MS-based technology that couples a handheld and biocompatible device, the MasSpec Pen, to a mass spectrometer for non-destructive ex vivo and in vivo analysis of cancer tissue in a matter of seconds. We have used the MasSpec Pen with multivariate statistical analysis to discriminate the molecular patterns of normal breast and lymph node from invasive cancer tissue, achieving accuracies over 88%. Our results showcase the potential of the MasSpec Pen to provide surgical guidance during BCS. A total of 213 banked human tissues including normal breast and lymph node, IDC, and IDC to lymph node were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network and stored at -80Â°C prior to analysis. Samples were then thawed and analyzed using a mass spectrometer coupled to the MasSpec Pen. During MasSpec Pen analysis, a single water droplet is held in contact with the tissue to extract molecules that are then analyzed by a mass spectrometer, yielding a molecular fingerprint. The molecular information obtained is analyzed by the statistical model to provide a predictive diagnosis in seconds. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) statistical method was used to generate predictive models comprised of molecular features indicative of healthy and diseased tissue. Analyzed regions of tissue were demarcated with a surgical ink marker, snap frozen, and sectioned at a thickness of 5Âµm. Tissue sections were HE 2019 Dec 10-14; San Antonio, TX.

A Robust Method for Transcript Quantification with RNA-Seq Data,"The advent of high throughput RNA-seq technology allows deep sampling of the transcriptome, making it possible to characterize both the diversity and the abundance of transcript isoforms. Accurate abundance estimation or transcript quantification of isoforms is critical for downstream differential analysis (e.g., healthy vs. diseased cells) but remains a challenging problem for several reasons. First, while various types of algorithms have been developed for abundance estimation, short reads often do not uniquely identify the transcript isoforms from which they were sampled. As a result, the quantification problem may not be identifiable, i.e., lacks a unique transcript solution even if the read maps uniquely to the reference genome. In this article, we develop a general linear model for transcript quantification that leverages reads spanning multiple splice junctions to ameliorate identifiability. Second, RNA-seq reads sampled from the transcriptome exhibit unknown position-specific and sequence-specific biases. We extend our method to simultaneously learn bias parameters during transcript quantification to improve accuracy. Third, transcript quantification is often provided with a candidate set of isoforms, not all of which are likely to be significantly expressed in a given tissue type or condition. By resolving the linear system with LASSO, our approach can infer an accurate set of dominantly expressed transcripts while existing methods tend to assign positive expression to every candidate isoform. Using simulated RNA-seq datasets, our method demonstrated better quantification accuracy and the inference of dominant set of transcripts than existing methods. The application of our method on real data experimentally demonstrated that transcript quantification is effective for differential analysis of transcriptomes.",2013,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology

"Scalable Price Targeting 1 Jean-Pierre DubÃ© , Chicago Booth and NBER","We study the welfare implications of scalable price targeting, an extreme form of third-degree price discrimination implemented with machine learning for a large, digital firm. Targeted prices are computed by solving the firmâ€™s Bayesian Decision-Theoretic pricing problem based on a database with a high-dimensional vector of customer features that are observed prior to the price quote. To identify the causal effect of price on demand, we first run a large, randomized price experiment and use these data to train our demand model. We use l1 regularization (lasso) to select the set of customer features that moderate the heterogeneous treatment effect of price on demand. We use a weighted likelihood Bayesian bootstrap to quantify the firmâ€™s approximate statistical uncertainty in demand and profitability. We then conduct a second experiment that implements our proposed price targeting scheme out of sample. Theoretically, both firm and customer surplus could rise with scalable price targeting. Optimized uniform pricing improves revenues by 64.9% relative to the control pricing, whereas scalable price targeting improves revenues by 81.5%. Firm profits increase by over 10% under targeted pricing relative to optimal uniform pricing. Customer surplus declines by less than 1% with price targeting; although nearly 70% of customers are charged less than the uniform price. Smaller firms with fewer job benefits are more likely to buy in the targeted pricing cell versus the uniform pricing cell. Our weighted likelihood bootstrap estimator also predicts demand and demand uncertainty out of sample better than a post-selection inference approach.",2017,
An Undersampled Phase Retrieval Algorithm via Gradient Iteration,"This work addresses the issue of undersampled phase retrieval using the gradient framework and proximal regularization theorem. It is formulated as an optimization problem in terms of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) form with $(l_{2}+P_{1})$ norms minimization in the case of sparse incident signals. Then, inspired by the compressive phase retrieval via majorization-minimization technique (C-PRIME) algorithm, a gradient-based PRIME algorithm is proposed to solve a quadratic approximation of the original problem. Moreover, we also proved that the C-PRIME method can be regarded as a special case of the proposed algorithm. As demonstrated by simulation results, both the magnitude and phase recovery abilities of the proposed algorithm are excellent. Furthermore, the experimental results also show the mean square error (MSE) performance of the proposed algorithm versus iterative step.",2018,2018 IEEE 10th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)

Despite substantial progress, there is a need to improve accuracy, speed, level of automation, and adaptability to new applications. This paper presents a robust and accurate novel method for segmenting cell nuclei using a combination of ideas. The image foreground is extracted automatically using a graph-cuts-based binarization. Next, nuclear seed points are detected by a novel method combining multiscale Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering constrained by distance-map-based adaptive scale selection. These points are used to perform an initial segmentation that is refined using a second graph-cuts-based algorithm incorporating the method of alpha expansions and graph coloring to reduce computational complexity. Nuclear segmentation results were manually validated over 25 representative images (15 in vitro images and 10 in vivo images, containing more than 7400 nuclei) drawn from diverse cancer histopathology studies, and four types of segmentation errors were investigated. The overall accuracy of the proposed segmentation algorithm exceeded 86%. The accuracy was found to exceed 94% when only overand undersegmentation errors were considered. The confounding image characteristics that led to most detection/segmentation errors were high cell density, high degree of clustering, poor image contrast and noisy background, damaged/irregular nuclei, and poor edge information. We present an efficient semiautomated approach to editing automated segmentation results that requires two mouse clicks per operation.",2010,
Variable inclusion and shrinkage algorithms,"The Lasso is a popular and computationally efficient procedure for automatically performing both variable selection and coefficient shrinkage on linear regression models. One limitation of the Lasso is that the same tuning parameter is used for both variable selection and shrinkage. As a result, it typically ends up selecting a model with too many variables to prevent overshrinkage of the regression coefficients. We suggest an improved class of methods called variable inclusion and shrinkage algorithms (VISA). Our approach is capable of selecting sparse models while avoiding overshrinkage problems and uses a path algorithm, and so also is computationally efficient. We show through extensive simulations that VISA significantly outperforms the Lasso and also provides improvements over more recent procedures, such as the Dantzig selector, relaxed Lasso, and adaptive Lasso. In addition, we provide theoretical justification for VISA in terms of nonasymptotic bounds on the estimation error that suggest it shoul...",2008,Journal of the American Statistical Association
"Medicinal plants used in the treatment of maternal health-related problems by the Mapulana of Ehlanzeni District, Mpumalanga province, South Africa","A decreased mortality rate among infants and children has been a health target for most health facilities. South Africaâ€™s free maternal healthcare services are not adequately utilized due to the tradition of new mothers following their parentsâ€™ footsteps. The use of medicinal plant species in maternal healthcare has been perceived to be effective and reliable in preventing illness among communities. For this study, ethnobotanical data were collected by means of interviews using semi-structured questions responded to by the elderly, community adults, and youth who had been selected on the basis of referrals. Infants within the communities have been treated with traditional medicine for ailments, such as colic, nail biting, sunken, and bulging fontanelles. Hypoxis hemerocallidea Fisch., C. A. Mey. & Ave-Lall, Lippia javanica (Burm.f.) Spreng., Vachellia karroo (Hayne) Banfi & Glasso, and Annona senegalensis Pers. subsp. senegalensis were among plant species which were frequently reported as being used medicinally. The decoction was mostly prepared from the roots (79%) followed by bulbs (8%) and most of the decoction was taken orally. The study identified 13 plant species used successfully for the treatment of bulging and sunken fontanelles.",2019,
Variable Selection and Parameter Estimation with the Atan Regularization Method,"Variable selection is fundamental to high-dimensional statistical modeling. Many variable selection techniques may be implemented by penalized least squares using various penalty functions. In this paper, an arctangent type penalty which very closely resembles penalty is proposed; we call it Atan penalty. The Atan-penalized least squares procedure is shown to consistently select the correct model and is asymptotically normal, provided the number of variables grows slower than the number of observations. The Atan procedure is efficiently implemented using an iteratively reweighted Lasso algorithm. Simulation results and data example show that the Atan procedure with BIC-type criterion performs very well in a variety of settings.",2016,Journal of Probability and Statistics
Robust high dimensional learning for Lipschitz and convex losses,"We establish risk bounds for Regularized Empirical Risk Minimizers (RERM) when the loss is Lipschitz and convex and the regularization function is a norm. We obtain these results in the i.i.d. setup under subgaussian assumptions on the design. In a second part, a more general framework where the design might have heavier tails and data may be corrupted by outliers both in the design and the response variables is considered. In this situation, RERM performs poorly in general. We analyse an alternative procedure based on median-of-means principles and called ""minmax MOM"". We show optimal subgaussian deviation rates for these estimators in the relaxed setting. The main results are meta-theorems allowing a wide-range of applications to various problems in learning theory. To show a non-exhaustive sample of these potential applications, it is applied to classification problems with logistic loss functions regularized by LASSO and SLOPE, to regression problems with Huber loss regularized by Group LASSO, Total Variation and Fused LASSO and to matrix completion problems with quantile loss regularized by the nuclear norm. A short simulation study concludes the paper, illustrating in particular robustness properties of regularized minmax MOM procedures.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Social facilitation of selective mortality.,"Territorial defense by breeders influences access to resources near defended nest sites by intruder species and may have indirect effects on other species within the territory, leading to local patchiness in distribution patterns. The present study demonstrates that adult males of a damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, indirectly facilitate the increased survival of conspecific juveniles through the territorial defense of their nesting site from potential egg predators. Moreover, male territoriality results in a shift in the selectivity of predation on newly settled juveniles. We monitored the fate of pairs of predator-naive, newly settled P. amboinensis placed inside and outside nesting territories. Individuals within a pair differed in size by approximately 1 mm and were tagged for individual identification. Away from male territories larger juveniles had greater survival, while within territories, larger juveniles suffered higher mortality. Behavioral observations indicated that the moonwrasse Thalassoma lunare, a predator of benthic eggs and small fishes, had reduced access to juveniles within male territories, while another predator on small fishes, the dottyback Pseudochromis fuscus, had unobstructed access to male territories. Experimental removal of P. fuscus indicated that the shift in the direction of phenotypic selection on newly settled juveniles was the indirect effect of aggression by nest-guarding male damselfish, which resulted in differential access to male territories by these two predators of small fishes. Evidence suggests that behavioral interactions between the resident community and intruders will influence patchiness in selective pressures imposed on benthic prey by influencing both the composition of predator types that can access the prey resource and their relative abundance. How this spatial and temporal patchiness in predator pressure interacts with spatial patchiness of recruiting prey will have a major influence on the resulting distribution of juveniles and their phenotypic traits.",2007,Ecology
Adaptive logistic group Lasso method for predicting the no-reflow among the multiple types of high-dimensional variables with missing data,"The prediction of no-reflow phenomenon aroused much attention, because of its independent association with increased in-hospital mortality, malignant arrhythmias, and cardiac failure. Many studies on prediction of no-reflow were carried out focusing on only few predictors. As big data era has been coming, high-dimensional predictors are available for prediction. However, as a common problem, big data analytics in healthcare from the electronic medical record (EMR) system is faced with many challenges, such as missing data processing, multiple types of variables processing and the high-dimensional data prediction. A general method based on improved weighted K-nearest neighbors and adaptive logistic group Lasso was proposed for predicting the no-reflow after cardiac surgery among the multiple types of variables with missing data. Compared with logistic regression, Lasso method, and artificial neural network method, our method has lower misclassification error rate and less complex model for no-reflow prediction, especially when predicting among multiple types of variables with missing data.",2016,2016 7th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science (ICSESS)
Graphical lassos for meta-elliptical distributions,MSC 2010: Primary 62H12; secondary 62H20 Abstract: Gaussian graphical lasso is a tool for estimating sparse graphs using a Gaussian log-likelihood with an ï¿½ 1 penalty on the inverse covariance matrix. This paper proposes a generalization to meta-elliptical distributions. Conditional uncorrelatedness is characterized in meta-elliptical families. The proposed meta- elliptical and re-weighted Kendall graphical lassos are computed from pseudo-observations which are func- tions of ranks of observations. They are invariant to strictly increasing transformations of the variables and do not assume the existence of moments. Simulations of receiver operating characteristic curves show noticeable improvements (in comparison with graphical lassos designed for meta-Gaussian distributions) for distributions which are not meta-Gaussian. These improvements are realized without ill effects when the distribution is meta-Gaussian. Deterministic and random contaminations of data are used to verify the robustness of the re-weighted Kendall graphical lasso.

Beyond â„“1 norm minimization â€” High quality recovery of non-sparse compressible signals,"We propose a novel algorithm for the recovery of non-sparse, but compressible signals from linear undersampled measurements. The algorithm proposed in this paper consists of two steps. The first step recovers the signal by the â„“1 minimization. Then, the second step decomposes the â„“1 reconstruction into major and minor components. By using the major components, measurements for the minor components of the target signal are estimated. Error evaluation of the estimate leads to the standard ridge regression for the recovery of the minor components with the regularization parameter determined using the error bound. After a slight modification to the major components, the final estimate is obtained by combining the two estimates. Computational cost of the proposed algorithm is mostly the same as the â„“1 minimization. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over not only â„“1 minimization but also the Lasso estimator.",2014,"Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA), 2014 Asia-Pacific"
A generic coordinate descent solver for nonsmooth convex optimization,"We present a generic coordinate descent solver for the minimization of a nonsmooth convex objective with structure. The method can deal in particular with problems with linear constraints. The implementation makes use of efficient residual updates and automatically determines which dual variables should be duplicated. A list of basic functional atoms is pre-compiled for efficiency and a modelling language in Python allows the user to combine them at run time. So, the algorithm can be used to solve a large variety of problems including Lasso, sparse multinomial logistic regression, linear and quadratic programs.",2018,arXiv: Optimization and Control

Two Tales of Variable Selection for High Dimensional Data: Screening and Model Building,"Variable selection plays an important role in high dimensional data analysis where a large number of variables are given as potential predictors of a response of interest. Typically, it arises at two stages of statistical modeling, namely screening and formal model building, with different goals. Screening aims at filtering out irrelevant variables prior to model building where a formal description of a functional relation between the variables screened for relevance and the response is sought. Accordingly, proper comparison of variable selection methods calls for evaluation criteria that reflect the differential goals: accuracy in ranking order of variables for screening and prediction accuracy for formal modeling. Without delineating the difference in the two aspects, confounding comparisons of various screening and selection methods have often been made in the literature, which may lead to misleading conclusions. In this dissertation, we present comprehensive numerical studies for comparison of three commonly used screening and selection procedures: correlation screening (a.k.a. sure independence screening), forward selection and LASSO in regression setting. By clearly differentiating these two aspects of variable selection, we highlight the situations where the performance of the three approaches differs, offering a guideline for proper choice of a method in practice. Furthermore, we discuss connections to relevant comparisons performed in the recent literature to clarify the different findings and conclusions. We also conduct similar types of studies for comparison of two corresponding screening and selection procedures of LASSO and correlation screening in classification setting, i.e., L1 ii penalized logistic regression and two-sample t-test. Initial results of exploratory analysis are presented to provide some insights on the preferred scenarios of the two methods respectively. Discussions are made on possible extensions, future works and difference between regression and classification setting.",2012,
Locomotor Activity Rhythm in Four Wrasse Species under Varying Light Conditions,"(Suezichthys gracilis, Thalassoma cupido, Labroides dimidiatus and Cirrhilabrus temminckii) were individually examined using an actograph with infra-red photo-electric switches in a dark room at temperatures of 21.3-24.3â€¢Å½, for 7 to 14 days. The locomotor activity of S. gracilis occurred mostly during the light period under a light-dark cycle regimen (LD 12:12; 06:00-18:00 light , 18:00-06:00 dark). The locomotor activity commenced at the beginning of the light period and continued until a little before the beginning of dark period. The diel activity rhythm of this species synchronizes with LD . Under constant illumination (LL) this species shows distinct free-running activity rhythms varying in length from 23 hrs . 39min. to 23 hrs. 47min. Therefore, S. gracilis appears to have a circadian rhythm under LL . However, in constant darkness (DD), the activity of this species was greatly suppressed. All the fish showed no activity rhythms in DD conditions. After DD, the fish showed the diel activity rhythm with the resumption of LD, but this activity began shortly after the beginning of light period. The fish required several days to synchronize with the activity in the light period. Therefore, S. gracilis appeared to continue the circadian rhythm under DD. In T. cupido, the locomotor activity commenced somewhat earlier than the beginning of the light period and continued until the beginning of the dark period under LD. The diel activity rhythm of this species synchronizes with LD. Under LL, four of the five specimens of this species tested showed free-running activity rhythms for the first 5 days or longer varying in length from 22 hrs . 54min. to 23 hrs. 39 min. Although the activity of this species was suppressed under DD , two of five fish showed free-running activity rhythms throughout the experimental period. The lengths of such freerunning periods were from 23 hrs. 38min. to 23 hrs. 50min. under DD. Therefore, it was ascertained that T. cupido has a circadian rhythm. In L. dimidiatus, the locomotor activity rhythm under LD resembled that observed in T. cupido. The diel activity rhythm of this species synchronizes with LD . Under LL, four of seven of this species showed free-running activity rhythms throughout the experimental period. The lengths of such free-running periods were from 23 hrs. 07min. to 25 hrs. 48min. Although the activity of this species was suppressed under DD, three of five fish showed free-running activity rhythms throughout the experimental period. The lengths of such free-running periods were from 23 hrs. 36min. to 23 hrs . 41min. under DD. Therefore, it was ascertained that L. dimidiatus has a circadian rhythm . Almost all locomotor activity of C temminckii occurred during the light period under LD. The diel activity rhythm of this species coincides with LD. Under LL, two of four of this species showed free-running activity rhythms throughout the experimental period. The lengths of such free-running periods were from 23 hrs . 32min. to 23 hrs. 45min. Although the activity of this species was suppressed under DD , one of the four fish showed free-running activity rhythms throughout the experimental period. The length of the free-running period was 23 hrs. 21min. under DD. Therefore, C temminckii appeared to have a circadian rhythm. According to field observations, S. gracilis burrows and lies in the sandy bottom while T. cupido, L. dimidiatus, and C. temminckii hide and rest in spaces among piles of boulders or in crevices of rocks during the night. It seems that the differences in nocturnal behavior among the four species of wrasses mentioned above are closely related to the intensity of endogenous factors in their locomotor activity rhythms.",1990,Japanese Journal of Ichthyology
Modeling disease progression via fused sparse group lasso,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder associated with aging. Understanding how the disease progresses and identifying related pathological biomarkers for the progression is of primary importance in Alzheimer's disease research. In this paper, we develop novel multi-task learning techniques to predict the disease progression measured by cognitive scores and select biomarkers predictive of the progression. In multi-task learning, the prediction of cognitive scores at each time point is considered as a task, and multiple prediction tasks at different time points are performed simultaneously to capture the temporal smoothness of the prediction models across different time points. Specifically, we propose a novel convex fused sparse group Lasso (cFSGL) formulation that allows the simultaneous selection of a common set of biomarkers for multiple time points and specific sets of biomarkers for different time points using the sparse group Lasso penalty and in the meantime incorporates the temporal smoothness using the fused Lasso penalty. The proposed formulation is challenging to solve due to the use of several non-smooth penalties. We show that the proximal operator associated with the proposed formulation exhibits a certain decomposition property and can be computed efficiently; thus cFSGL can be solved efficiently using the accelerated gradient method. To further improve the model, we propose two non-convex formulations to reduce the shrinkage bias inherent in the convex formulation. We employ the difference of convex programming technique to solve the non-convex formulations. Our extensive experiments using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed progression models in comparison with existing methods for disease progression. We also perform longitudinal stability selection to identify and analyze the temporal patterns of biomarkers in disease progression.",2012,KDD : proceedings.

University of Groningen Efficient Structure-Aware Selection Techniques for 3 D Point Cloud Visualizations with 2 DOF,"Data selection is a fundamental task in visualization because it serves as a pre-requisite to many follow-up interactions. Efficient spatial selection in 3D point cloud datasets consisting of thousands or millions of particles can be particularly challenging. We present two new techniques, TeddySelection and CloudLasso, that support the selection of subsets in large particle 3D datasets in an interactive and visually intuitive manner. Specifically, we describe how to spatially select a subset of a 3D particle cloud by simply encircling the target particles on screen using either the mouse or direct-touch input. Based on the drawn lasso, our techniques automatically determine a bounding selection surface around the encircled particles based on their density. This kind of selection technique can be applied to particle datasets in several application domains. TeddySelection and CloudLasso reduce, and in some cases even eliminate, the need for complex multi-step selection processes involving Boolean operations. This was confirmed in a formal, controlled user study in which we compared the more flexible CloudLasso technique to the standard cylinder-based selection technique. This study showed that the former is consistently more efficient than the latterâ€”in several cases the CloudLasso selection time was half that of the corresponding cylinder-based selection.",2012,
Palynology of the Jurassicâ€cretaceous boundary in southern England,"Abstract Miospore assemblages recovered from marine Upper Kimmeridgian and Portlandian and from nonmarine and lagoonal Purbeck Beds (which span the Jurassicâ€Cretaceous boundary) in Dorset and Sussex are dominated numerically by Classopollis and/or Inaperturoâ€pollenites and show a progressive diversification of species with time. Three microfloral suites containing a total of 77 species are recognized. Each suite is characterized by the entrance of new forms and by the frequencies of constituent species. The oldest suite is dominated by coniferalean pollen with less frequent pteridophyte spores and rare cycadalean pollen. The succeeding suites record a progressive diversification of pteridophyte and bryophyte spore types which are not, however, as abundant as coniferalean pollen. The overâ€all species composition of the suites is believed to be controlled by evolutionary or largeâ€scale phytogeographic factors; but the detailed composition of each assemblage is controlled, in part, by local ecologicalâ€enviro...",1970,
Systematicity and connectionist language learning,"In 1988 Fodor and Pylyshyn issued a challenge to the newly-popular connectionism: explain the systematicity of cognition without merely implementing a so-called classical architecture. Since that time quite a number of connectionist models have been put forward, either by their designers or by others, as in some measure demonstrating that the challenge can be met (e.g., Pollack 1988, 1990; Smolensky 1990; Chalmers 1990; Niklasson & Sharkey 1992; Brousse 1993). Unfortunately, it has generally been unclear whether these models actually do have this implication (see, for instance, the extensive philosophical debate in Smolensky 1988; Fodor & McLaughlin 1990; van Gelder 1990, 1991; McLaughlin 1993a, 1993b; Clark 1993). Indeed, we know of no major supporter of classical orthodoxy who has felt compelled, by connectionist models and arguments, to concede in print that connectionists have in fact delivered a non-classical explanation of systematicity.",1994,
Locating material defects via wavefield demixing with morphologically germane dictionaries,"This article introduces a methodology for the detection and localization of structural defects in solid media using morphological demixing algorithms. The demixing algorithms are designed to separate spatiotemporal response data into two morphologically antithetical components: one contribution captures the spatially sparse and temporally persistent features of the mediumâ€™s response, while the other provides a representation of the dominant, globally smooth component as it would be observed in a defect-free medium. Within the demixing paradigm, we explore two methods: in the first, we cast the demixing task in terms of a group Lasso regularization problem with simply structured orthonormal dictionaries; the second method makes use of a more morphologically germane dictionary whose additional structure allows for the localization of defects whose signature may be highly elusive, for example, buried in noise or masked by competing features. After the demixing is complete, an automatic visualization tool highlights the regions associated with potential anomalies and outputs their local coordinates. Since the method does not invoke any knowledge of the material properties of the medium, or of its behavior in its pristine conditions, and is solely based on data processing of current wavefield information, it is endowed with significant model agnostic and baseline-free attributes. These properties are desirable in systems where there exists limited or unreliable a priori knowledge of the constitutive model, when the physical domain is highly heterogeneous or compromised by large damage zones, or when accurate baseline simulations are unavailable. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated against synthetically generated data and experimental data obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer.",2017,Structural Health Monitoring
Mind the Gap: a Case Study of Demand Prediction and Factors Affecting Waiting Time at Uber NYC and Washington D.C.,"As the ride-hailing economy has been rapidly growing, case studies of Uberâ€™s forecasting and pricing frameworks have received much attention among researchers and investigative journalists. This paper 1) attempts to forecast Uberâ€™s fulfilled pickups via predictive modelling, and 2) conducts a retrospective study to examine the role of socio-economic factors and surge pricing on ridersâ€™ waiting time along with their implications. By seeking to answer questions regarding these two topics, this paper hopes to shed light on the demand-supply dynamics of Uber service, and provides empirical analysis and potential suggestions for future improvement. The scope of this paper focuses on New York City and Washington D.C., where public data is available. This paper evaluates the performance under various predictive statistical learning models based on the lowest error rate (RMSE being the major criteria), while the explanatory modelling section adopts more traditional statistical tools, as well as a Bayesian network. The results suggest that LASSO has outperformed other models used in this thesis for the demand forecast. Moreover, there is a lack of evidence that surge pricing has a consistent effect in reducing ridersâ€™ average waiting time. Furthermore, various socio-economic factors are found to have significant associations with waiting time, and in particular, districts with higher ethnic minority rates are associated with longer average waiting time, which calls for further examination on the dynamics of Uberâ€™s service delivery.",2019,

Robust Inference on Average Treatment Effects with Possibly More Covariates than Observations,"This paper concerns robust inference on average treatment effects following model selection. In the selection on observables framework, we show how to construct confidence intervals based on a doubly-robust estimator that are robust to model selection errors and prove that they are valid uniformly over a large class of treatment effect models. The class allows for multivalued treatments with heterogeneous effects (in observables), general heteroskedasticity, and selection amongst (possibly) more covariates than observations. Our estimator attains the semiparametric efficiency bound under appropriate conditions. Precise conditions are given for any model selector to yield these results, and we show how to combine data-driven selection with economic theory. For implementation, we give a specific proposal for selection based on the group lasso and derive new technical results for high-dimensional, sparse multinomial logistic regression. A simulation study shows our estimator performs very well in finite samples over a wide range of models. Revisiting the National Supported Work demonstration data, our method yields accurate estimates and tight confidence intervals.",2013,

Microbial Hydrocarbon-Removal Under Halostress,"Oceans which occupy about 70 % of the earthâ€™s surface represent a moderately saline environment. In addition, there are all over the world hypersaline areas, and the industry continuously produces huge amounts of liquid saline wastes. Similar to the nonsaline environments, saline ones harbor halophilic/halotolerant microorganisms with versatile physiological activities. Many of them are phototrophs or chemolithotrophs, and consequently serve as primary producers in these environments. Other microorganisms have the potential for biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds. The saline environments are also subjected to hydrocarbon pollution through legal and illegal human activity. Such environments too harbor halophilic/halotolerant, hydrocarbonoclastic microorganism which rid those environments of hydrocarbon pollutants. These microorganism are either planktonic, or more frequently associated with other microbes to form biofilms on animate and inanimates substrates. Seawaters accommodate numerous hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria belonging predominantly to the Gammaproteobacteria subgroup. Most prominent are the members of the group of the â€œobligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteriaâ€ (OHCB) belonging to the genera Alcanivorax, Marinobacter, Thalassolithus, Cycloclasticus and Oleispira. Hypersaline areas harbor in addition, hydrocarbonoclastic haloarchaea. Artificially established biofilms comprising halophilic, hydrocarbonclastic microorganisms revealed active in hydrocarbon removal. It may be expected that the future will witness using such man-made biofilms in bioremediation of saline wastes polluted with hydrocarbons in bioreactors.",2015,
GASA Based Signal Reconstruction for Compressive Sensing,"Reconstruction, which is the core of compressive sensing (CS), can be implemented by l0 norm minimization. In practice, l0 norm minimization is a NP-hard problem that requires exhaustively listing all possibilities of the original signal and is difficult to achieve by traditional algorithms. This paper proposes a signal reconstruction algorithm combining genetic algorithm with simulated annealing algorithm which is famous for their superior performance in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The method in this paper can solve l0 norm minimization directly and can reconstruct noiseless signal accurately. It has been proved through numerical simulations that the theoretical optimization performance for signal reconstruction can be achieved. The quality of reconstruction based on the proposed method is superior to that of OMP, smooth l0 norm (SL0) algorithm, Lasso and BP algorithm.",2015,"2015 Fifth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control (IMCCC)"
"Isolation and Characterization of Salt-Tolerant Bacterial Strains in Salt-Affected Soils of Erzurum, Turkey","In the current study, 18 salt-tolerant bacteria were isolated from salt-affected soil of Erzurum, Turkey.

Quality optimization of H.264/AVC video transmission over noisy environments using a sparse regression framework,"We propose the use of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression method in order to predict the Cumulative Mean Squared Error (CMSE), incurred by the loss of individual slices in video transmission. We extract a number of quality-relevant features from the H.264/AVC video sequences, which are given as input to the LASSO. This method has the benefit of not only keeping a subset of the features that have the strongest effects towards video quality, but also produces accurate CMSE predictions. Particularly, we study the LASSO regression through two different architectures; the Global LASSO (G.LASSO) and Local LASSO (L.LASSO). In G.LASSO, a single regression model is trained for all slice types together, while in L.LASSO, motivated by the fact that the values for some features are closely dependent on the considered slice type, each slice type has its own regression model, in an e ort to improve LASSO's prediction capability. Based on the predicted CMSE values, we group the video slices into four priority classes. Additionally, we consider a video transmission scenario over a noisy channel, where Unequal Error Protection (UEP) is applied to all prioritized slices. The provided results demonstrate the efficiency of LASSO in estimating CMSE with high accuracy, using only a few features. les that typically contain high-entropy data, producing a footprint that is far less conspicuous than existing methods. The system uses a local web server to provide a le system, user interface and applications through an web architecture.",2015,
Forecasting medium-term electricity demand in a South African electric power supply system,"The paper discusses an application of generalised additive models (GAMs) in predicting medium-term hourly electricity demand using South African data for 2009 to 2013. Variable selection was done using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) via hierarchical interactions, resulting in a model called GAM-Lasso. The GAM-Lasso model was then extended by including tensor product interactions to yield a second model, called GAM- -Lasso. Comparative analyses of these two models were done with a gradient-boosting model to act as a benchmark model and the third model. The forecasts from the three models were combined using a forecast combination algorithm where the average loss suffered by the models was based on the pinball loss function. The results showed significantly improved accuracy of forecasts, making this study a useful tool for decision-makers and system operators in power utility companies, particularly in maintenance planning including medium-term risk assessment. A major contribution of this paper is the inclusion of a nonlinear trend. Another contribution is the inclusion of temperature based on two thermal regions of South Africa.",2017,Journal of Energy in Southern Africa
Non-Linear Returns to Schooling Among Filipino Men,"The issue of possible non-linearities in the relationship between log wages and schooling has received a good deal of attention in the literature on the United States, as well as in Less Developed Countries (LDCs). In this paper, I use data from a recent household survey for the Philippines, the 1998 Annual Poverty Indicator Survey (APIS), to test the fit of the log-linear specification for Filipino men. I present results based on a number of estimation strategies, including discontinuous spline regressions, semi-parametric regressions with a large number of dummies for years of schooling and experience, and kernel regressions. The basic conclusions of the paper are two. First, there appear to be large differences between the rates of return to education across levels in the Philippines. In particular, the wage premia to both primary and secondary education are lower than those for tertiary education. Second, within a given level, the last year of schooling is disproportionately rewarded in terms of higher wages. That is, there are clear sheepskin effects associated with graduation from primary school, secondary school, and university. * Economist, East Asia and the Pacific, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management, The World Bank. 1 I would like to thank Harold Alderman, Ruperto Alonzo, Benu Bidani, Gaurav Datt, Olivier Deschenes, Emanuela Galasso, Hans Hoogeveen, Emmanuel Jimenez, Homi Kharas, Erzo Luttmer, Tamar Manuelyan Atinc, and Lant Pritchett for many useful comments and conversations.

Epidemic of fatal encephalopathy in preschool children in Burkina Faso and consumption of unripe ackee (Blighia sapida) fruit,"BACKGROUND
On March 21, 1998, the Regional Health Authority of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, asked the Centre Muraz to investigate an unexplained outbreak of epidemic fatal encephalopathy (EFE). We aimed to identify the cause of this epidemic.


METHODS
We identified cases retrospectively through review of health-service records and interviews of family members, village chiefs, and local healers. Active surveillance was started in administrative divisions within the study area in April, 1998, to identify further EFE cases. We did a case-control study of households to investigate the risk from various environmental and health factors. Blood and urine samples were collected if possible and urine dicarboxylic acid concentrations measured by gas chromatography.


FINDINGS
29 cases of EFE were identified from January to May, 1998. Estimated age-specific attack rates (2-6 years) ranged from 31 to 847 per 100,000 population (p<0.001). The most common symptoms were hypotonia, vomiting, convulsions, and coma. All children died in 2-48 h. The only factor associated with EFE was the presence of ackee trees (Blighia sapida) within 100 m of households (odds ratio 5.1 [95% CI 1.8-14.7] p=0.001). Poisoning with unripe ackee fruits was suggested by urine concentrations of dicarboxylic acids four to 200 times higher in cases (n=2) than in controls (n=3).


CONCLUSION
Consumption of unripe ackee fruit probably caused this epidemic and may lead to a substantial number of unexplained deaths in preschool children in west Africa every year. Educational campaigns have the potential to prevent these deaths.",1999,The Lancet
A LASSO penalized regression approach for genome-wide association analyses using related individuals: application to the Genetic Analysis Workshop 19 simulated data,"We propose a novel LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) penalized regression method used to analyze samples consisting of (potentially) related individuals. Developed in the context of linear mixed models, our method models the relatedness of individuals in the sample through a random effect whose covariance structure is a linear function of known matrices with elements combinations of the condensed coefficients of identity between the individuals in the sample. We implement our method to analyze the simulated family data provided by the 19th Genetic Analysis Workshop in an effort to identify loci regulating the simulated trait of systolic blood pressure. The analyses were performed with full knowledge of the simulation model. Our findings demonstrate that we can significantly reduce the rate of false positive signals by incorporating the relatedness of the study participants.",2016,BMC Proceedings
Early Postâ€settlement Mortality in a Coral Reef Fish and Its Effect on Local Population Size,"The relative importance of recruitment and post-recruitment factors in controlling population fluctuations and determining population sizes in open marine systems is still poorly understood. To address this issue, I conducted an experiment investigating whether very early post-recruitment mortality of a coral reef fish, Thalassoma bifasciatum, is dependent on recruitment density. To quantify the extent to which local populations are likely to be controlled primarily by recruitment or by post-settlement density-dependent mortality, I also measured natural mortality rates and recruitment variation at sites around the island of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. 
 
I manipulated densities of 1â€“3-d post-settlement T. bifasciatum on large natural patch reefs in Tague Bay, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. Manipulated recruits were followed for âˆ¼30 d. The loss rate over the initial 24-h period following placement of recruits on the reef was positively related to the density at the beginning of that period. After this period, initial recruit density had no effects on mortality. 
 
Natural monthly mortality rates approximating the monthly mortality monitored during the experiment were measured for naturally recruited fish at sites around the island. Mortality was positively correlated with recruitment density. The effect was strong enough that across sites the relationship between recruit density and juvenile density the following month was not proportional; that is, juvenile density tended to reach an asymptote with increasing recruitment. The relationship between total recruitment per season at a site and adult abundance at the end of the season was similarly asymptotic, indicating the persistence of a density-dependent effect at the scale of the island. 
 
Mortality rates around the island were extremely variable and density independent at densities below âˆ¼1 recruit/m2. Above that level, mortality rates were higher and tended to increase with further increases in recruitment density. Around St. Croix, three out of eight sites consistently received recruitment above this â€œthreshold,â€ while five sites never experienced recruitment above that level during the study. Because spatial patterns of recruitment around St. Croix were consistent over time, some local populations may be controlled mainly by recruitment and density-independent mortality at all times, while others may be chronically affected by post-settlement density dependence. This study gives support to the idea that recruitment limitation and density dependence are not mutually exclusive. Rather, local populations must be characterized by the degree of recruitment, the resultant population density, and the subsequent degree of density-dependent regulation.",1999,Ecological Monographs
"Fish predation : a preliminary study of its role in the zoogeography and evolution of shallow water idoteid isopods (Crustacea, Isopoda, Idoteidae).","Behavioural, morphological and distributional patterns of idoteid isopods (family Idoteidae) from the northeast Pacific are analysed with respect to the hypothesis of increasing predation pressure from fishes in the lower latitudes. Minimum reproductive size and maximum body length of idoteids both decrease with decreasing latitudes; body ornamentation increases with decreasing latitudes. Members of the tropical and subtropical genera Parasymmerus, Eusymmerus, Colidotea and Erichsonella are smaller and more ornamented than species of the temperate genus Idotea. The subtropical isopod Colidotea findleyi is a 'swimmer', whereas the larger, more conspicuous, temperate species Idotea urotoma shows no preference between 'swimming' and 'nonswimming' behaviour. In laboratory predation experiments, the tropical wrasse Thalassoma lucasanum selected larger isopod prey items, as well as preferring Idotea urotoma over Colidotea findleyi of equal length. The geological evolution of the region is discussed in regards to vicariant events, shifting faunal waves, and modern zoogeographic patterns of idoteid isopods. Data obtained in this study support the hypothesis that fish predation may play a major role in controlling the southern range limits of temperate rocky-shore isopods, and that this same pressure may have affected the evolution of idoteid isopod body size and morphology in the northeast Pacific.",1982,Journal of Biogeography
Classification of Unmedicated Bipolar Disorder Using Whole-Brain Functional Activity and Connectivity: A Radiomics Analysis.,"The aim of this study was to develop and validate a method of disease classification for bipolar disorder (BD) by functional activity and connectivity using radiomics analysis. Ninety patients with unmedicated BD II as well as 117 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). A total of 4 types of 7018 features were extracted after preprocessing, including mean regional homogeneity (mReHo), mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), and voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Then, predictive features were selected by Mann-Whitney U test and removing variables with a high correlation. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was further used to select features. At last, support vector machine (SVM) model was used to estimate the state of each subject based on the selected features after LASSO. Sixty-five features including 54 RSFCs, 7 mALFFs, 1 mReHo, and 3 VMHCs were selected. The accuracy and area under curve (AUC) of the SVM model built based on the 65 features is 87.3% and 0.919 in the training dataset, respectively, and the accuracy and AUC of this model validated in the validation dataset is 80.5% and 0.838, respectively. These findings demonstrate a valid radiomics approach by rs-fMRI can identify BD individuals from healthy controls with a high classification accuracy, providing the potential adjunctive approach to clinical diagnostic systems.",2019,Cerebral cortex
Staphylococcus aureus Nasal Carriage in Medical Students of Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Staphylococcus aureus is a normal flora that primarily resides in the nose and throat of healthy individuals. It was estimated that between 20-30% of healthy population colonise S. aureus in vestibulum nasi of their anterior nares [1, 2, 3]. In hospital settings, there are many reports that associate healthcare workers being the source of cross-transmission of S. aureus between patients [4, 5, 6]. S. aureus has been associated with surgical wound infections [7], hospitalassociated pneumonia, catheter-associated infections [8] and bacteraemia [9]. Although asymptomatic nasal colonisation with S. aureus is common amongst healthcare workers, transmission of methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) to critically-ill patients could result in debilitating outcomes and complications to treatment [10]. Nosocomial infections by MRSA result in morbidity of hospitalised patients, prolonged duration of hospitalization and increasing the cost of healthcare [11, 12]. Strategies for an effective preventive measure are needed to eliminate the source of the infections and/or reduce transmission of MRSA among healthcare workers. Medical students who will be future healthcare workers play a role in the intervention strategy of S. aureus transmission in the hospital settings. They need to be aware of their potential risk as S. aureus nasal carriage and be prepared with sufficient knowledge in infection control. This study aims to determine the prevalence of nasal carriage of MRSA among medical students of UiTM and to detect the presence of leukotoxins that are associated with lysis of leukocytes and erythrocytes. These two toxins, i.e. Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) and ï§-haemolysin, are in the family of synergohymenotropic. Presence of both toxins will be able to destroy the cell membrane of hostâ€™s defense cells and erythrocytes by synergistic action [13]. ABSTRACT",2017,
Graphical LASSO based Model Selection for Time Series,"We propose a novel graphical model selection scheme for high-dimensional stationary time series or discrete time processes. The method is based on a natural generalization of the graphical LASSO algorithm, introduced originally for the case of i.i.d. samples, and estimates the conditional independence graph of a time series from a finite length observation. The graphical LASSO for time series is defined as the solution of an l1-regularized maximum (approximate) likelihood problem. We solve this optimization problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Our approach is nonparametric as we do not assume a finite dimensional parametric model, but only require the process to be sufficiently smooth in the spectral domain. For Gaussian processes, we characterize the performance of our method theoretically by deriving an upper bound on the probability that our algorithm fails. Numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of our method to recover the correct conditional independence graph from a limited amount of samples.",2015,IEEE Signal Processing Letters
Feedback-Controlled Sequential Lasso Screening,"One way to solve lasso problems when the dictionary does not fit into available memory is to first screen the dictionary to remove unneeded features. Prior research has shown that sequential screening methods offer the greatest promise in this endeavor. Most existing work on sequential screening targets the context of tuning parameter selection, where one screens and solves a sequence of $N$ lasso problems with a fixed grid of geometrically spaced regularization parameters. In contrast, we focus on the scenario where a target regularization parameter has already been chosen via cross-validated model selection, and we then need to solve many lasso instances using this fixed value. In this context, we propose and explore a feedback controlled sequential screening scheme. Feedback is used at each iteration to select the next problem to be solved. This allows the sequence of problems to be adapted to the instance presented and the number of intermediate problems to be automatically selected. We demonstrate our feedback scheme using several datasets including a dictionary of approximate size 100,000 by 300,000.",2016,ArXiv
Searching the optimal folding routes of a Complex Lasso protein,"Understanding how polypeptides can efficiently and reproducibly attain a self-entangled conformation is a compelling biophysical challenge, which might shed new light on our general knowledge of protein folding. Complex Lassos, namely self-entangled protein structures characterized by a covalent loop sealed by a cysteine bridge, represent an ideal test system in the framework of entangled folding. Indeed, as cysteine bridges form in oxidizing conditions, they can be used as on/off switches of the structure topology, to investigate the role played by the backbone entanglement in the process. In the present work we have used molecular dynamics to simulate the folding of a complex lasso glycoprotein, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, modeling both reducing and oxidizing conditions. Together with a well-established Go-like description, we have employed the elastic folder model, a Coarse-Grained, minimalistic representation of the polypeptide chain, driven by a structure-based angular potential. The purpose of this study is to assess the kinetically optimal pathways, in relation to the formation of the native topology. To this end we have implemented an evolutionary strategy that tunes the elastic folder model potentials to maximize the folding probability within the early stages of the dynamics. The resulting protein model is capable of folding with high success rate, avoiding the kinetic traps that hamper the efficient folding in the other tested models. Employing specifically designed topological descriptors, we could observe that the selected folding routes avoid the topological bottleneck by locking the cysteine bridge after the topology is formed. These results provide valuable insights on the selection of mechanisms in self-entangled protein folding while, at the same time, the proposed methodology can complement the usage of established minimalistic models, and draw useful guidelines for more detailed simulations.",2018,bioRxiv
"Grain Sorghum Hybrid Response to Lasso and Dual Herbicides and Efficacy of Screen, Concep Ii, and Concep Ii/apron Seed Safeners1","Greenhouse and field studies were conducted from 1987 to 1989 to determine sensitivity of 20 grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.] hybrids to preplant incorporated treatments of 4.0 lb ai Dual/acre or 5.0 lb ai Lasso/acre. The safening abilities of Screen, Concep II, and Concep II plus Apron seed treatments were compared utilizing an unsafened control under greenhouse and field conditions. Analysis of variance revealed a significant year by hybrid by herbicide by seed safener interaction. Seed safeners did not slow seedling emergence in the no-herbicide treatments in the field or greenhouse. In general, Screen, Concep II, and Concep II/Apron prevented herbicide injury to all hybrids. However, some instances of seed safener failure occurred. These failures were not consistent to any seed safener, herbicide, or sorghum hybrid. Concep II and Screen provided reciprocal protection from Dual and Lasso injury. Apron, in combination with Concep II as a seed treatment, did not reduce the safening ability of Concep II. Although some differences in efficacy did occur among seed treatments, most differences were due to hybrid response. Use of seed safeners with Dual and Lasso is still recommended. Grain sorghum hybrids responded differently to application of Dual and Lasso herbicides and the response was inconsistent among years. Variation among hybrids used in this study was too great to recommend any as more tolerant of these herbicides. However, sound production practices can reduce the potential for injury from herbicides.",1989,
"Preachers, Pronunciatio, and Music: Hearing Rhetoric in Renaissance Sacred Polyphony","The system of musical rhetoric proposed by Joachim Burmeister at the end of the sixteenth century has been enthusiastically embraced by many musical scholars as a theoretical foundation for the understanding of late Renaissance music.1 On the surface, at least, this enthusiasm is not misplaced. Burmeister matched his descriptions of rhetorical musical tropes and figures with concrete examples, so that by following his model it is possible to analyze polyphonic music according to the principles of a system of language that profoundly influenced the development of literature and oratory in early modern Europe. His famous analysis of Lasso's motet In me transierunt identifies the motet's formal rhetorical divisions",1998,The Musical Quarterly
Robust Sparse Regularization: Simultaneously Optimizing Neural Network Robustness and Compactness,"Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained by the gradient descent method is known to be vulnerable to maliciously perturbed adversarial input, aka. adversarial attack. As one of the countermeasures against adversarial attack, increasing the model capacity for DNN robustness enhancement was discussed and reported as an effective approach by many recent works. In this work, we show that shrinking the model size through proper weight pruning can even be helpful to improve the DNN robustness under adversarial attack. For obtaining a simultaneously robust and compact DNN model, we propose a multi-objective training method called Robust Sparse Regularization (RSR), through the fusion of various regularization techniques, including channel-wise noise injection, lasso weight penalty, and adversarial training. We conduct extensive experiments across popular ResNet-20, ResNet-18 and VGG-16 DNN architectures to demonstrate the effectiveness of RSR against popular white-box (i.e., PGD and FGSM) and black-box attacks. Thanks to RSR, 85% weight connections of ResNet-18 can be pruned while still achieving 0.68% and 8.72% improvement in clean- and perturbed-data accuracy respectively on CIFAR-10 dataset, in comparison to its PGD adversarial training baseline.",2019,ArXiv
Variable importance analysis based on rank aggregation with applications in metabolomics for biomarker discovery.,"Biomarker discovery is one important goal in metabolomics, which is typically modeled as selecting the most discriminating metabolites for classification and often referred to as variable importance analysis or variable selection. Until now, a number of variable importance analysis methods to discover biomarkers in the metabolomics studies have been proposed. However, different methods are mostly likely to generate different variable ranking results due to their different principles. Each method generates a variable ranking list just as an expert presents an opinion. The problem of inconsistency between different variable ranking methods is often ignored. To address this problem, a simple and ideal solution is that every ranking should be taken into account. In this study, a strategy, called rank aggregation, was employed. It is an indispensable tool for merging individual ranking lists into a single ""super""-list reflective of the overall preference or importance within the population. This ""super""-list is regarded as the final ranking for biomarker discovery. Finally, it was used for biomarkers discovery and selecting the best variable subset with the highest predictive classification accuracy. Nine methods were used, including three univariate filtering and six multivariate methods. When applied to two metabolic datasets (Childhood overweight dataset and Tubulointerstitial lesions dataset), the results show that the performance of rank aggregation has improved greatly with higher prediction accuracy compared with using all variables. Moreover, it is also better than penalized method, least absolute shrinkage and selectionator operator (LASSO), with higher prediction accuracy or less number of selected variables which are more interpretable.",2016,Analytica chimica acta
Comparison of Different Regularized and Shrinkage Regression Methods to Predict Daily Tropospheric Ozone Concentration in the Grand Casablanca Area,"Tropospheric ozone (O3) is one of 
the pollutants that have a significant impact on human health. It can increase 
the rate of asthma crises, cause permanent lung infections and death. 
Predicting its concentration levels is therefore important for planning 
atmospheric protection strategies. The aim of this study is to predict the 
daily mean O3 concentration one day ahead in the Grand Casablanca area of 
Morocco using primary pollutants and meteorological variables. Since the 
available explanatory variables are multicollinear, multiple linear regressions 
are likely to lead to unstable models. To counteract the multicollinearity problem, we compared several 
alternative regression methods: 1) Continuum Regression; 2) Ridge & Lasso Regressions; 3) Principal component regression (PCR); 4) Partial least Square regression & sparse PLS and; 5) Biased Power Regression. The aim is to set up a good prediction model 
of the daily ozone in the Grand Casablanca area. These models are fitted on a 
training data set (from the years 2013 and 2014), tested on a data set (from 
2015) and validated on yet another data set data (from 2015). The Lasso model 
showed a better performance for the prediction of ozone concentrations compared 
to multiple linear regression and its other alternative methods.",2018,Advances in Pure Mathematics
Spindle thermal error robust modeling using LASSO and LS-SVM,"To improve the spindle thermal error prediction accuracy, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is used to directly select the temperature-sensitive point subset to guarantee the prediction performance of the thermal error model built by least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). Taking a horizontal machining center as a test stand, the thermal error experiments with different spindle speed states are carried out. Then the temperature-sensitive points are selected using LASSO. The number of temperature-sensitive points is reduced from 20 to 7. Afterward, the thermal error model is designed by LS-SVM. The prediction performance and generalization performance of the thermal error model are compared with another two thermal error models using gray model (GM) and multiple linear regression (MLR), respectively. The comparison results indicate that the thermal error model derived from LS-SVM shows better prediction performance and generalization performance than those derived from GM and MLR with the highest prediction accuracy increasing about 74.6 and 54.3%, respectively. Thus, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed spindle thermal error robust modeling method are validated.",2018,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology
Functionals that do not attain their norm,"AbstractWe study the set of nonâ€“normâ€“attaining functionals on a Banach space,giving a suï¬ƒcient condition for thedensity of thisset. We also ï¬nda large classof Banach spaces for which the set of normâ€“attaining functionals is (denseâ€“)lineable.

One reason for this interestarises from geometrical considerations and the connection with the Banachâ€“Mazurconjecture (see [11].) Namely, it was shown in [3] that every transitive and separableBanach space in which the set of nonâ€“normâ€“attaining functionals is not dense is ro-tund. Another motivation comes from an open problem concerning the lineability ofthe set NA(X) of normâ€“attaining functionals on a Banach space X.

"""Ecce, quomodo moritur justus"" by J. Gallus and by Some of His Contemporaries","In the comparative study presented here the author first concentrates on ""Ecce, quomodo moritur iustus"" by the composers M. A. Ingegneri and L. Viadana and on Gallus' motet with the same text; the compositions have clearly features in common â€“ compact homophony, syllabic and declamatory melody, clear articulation and formal disposition with refrain (aBaB). Especiall interesting is Ingegneri's composition, with its melody within the first six measures being nearly identic with that by Gallus. It appears that the two composers set to music this text at almost the same, or even at the same time â€“ but each independently of the other. Although the degree of relatedness between Gallus' and Viadana's ""Ecce, quomodo moritur iustus"" is smaller than that between the corresponding compositions by Gallus and Ingegneri, here there can be found also some similarities concerning detailed points. Very different from the above mentioned motets ""Ecce, quomodo moritus iustus"" are in character and structure motets bearing the same title and composed by O. di Lasso, T. L. de Victoria, and C. Gesualdo da Venosa. Lasso 's and Victoria's motets are written poliphonically, but the composition by the Spanish master assumes through the constant use of imitation a rather more pronounced linear aspect. Something wholly specific is ""Ecce, quomodo moritur iustus"" by C. Gesualdo da Venosa, which distinctly shows already signs of mannerism and which is characterized by fragmentation of texture and the use of sharply contrasting elements within the narrow space. That in this context emerge, ""forbidden"" melodic intervals, cross-relations, chromatic third-relations and changes of tonality levels is perfectly understandable. Although our discussion here relates to compositions of artistic values, it is not difficult to decide to put first the compositions by J. Gallus and C. Gesualdo da Venosa as two eminent achievements of two great masters of their time. In both cases we feel the author's strong personal affection and powerful expression which are deeply moving. This is of course achieved by perfectly different means of expression and so the two compositions are very contrary to each other. Gesualdo's is emotionally fervent, restless, dramatically agitated and split up, but at the same time more complex and artistic in structure as well as richer in means of expression. As such it is in its message less direct and both for the performer and the listener more demanding. In spite of the personal commitment of the author, Gallus' ""Ecce, quomodo moritur"" is marked by classical serenity and at the same time by a kind of stoicism. Here the straightforward, logical and throughout tense structure is combined with a surprising intensity of expressiveness and a deep intrinsic meaning.",1985,Musicological Annual
APPORT DE LA KINESITHERAPIE DANS LA PREVENTION DES RAIDEURS POSTTRAUMATIQUES DU GENOU Contribution of physiotherapy in prevention of the posttraumatics stiffnesses of the knee,"Objective : The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of physiotherapy in the prevention of the posttraumatic stiffnesses of the knee. Methods : This was a prospective descriptive study of trauma cases of the knee treated in the department of functional rehabilitation of the University Teaching Hospital of BoboDioulasso over a period of six months. All patients followed the same protocol support which helped to evaluate different parameters such as joint mobility, the crural amyotrophy, pain and functional performance in pre and postrehabilitation. Results : We recruited 20 patients, 11 men and 9 women giving a sexratio of 1.22. Mean age was 39.15 years. Accidents traffic represented the leading cause of knee injury with 55% of cases. 90% of patients received rehabilitation at a frequency of 2 sessions per week against 10% who counted 3 times a week. 75% of our patients had a fit result against 25% who had an average score. Conclusion : the traumatic pathology of the knee is the prerogative of the young adults. Physiotherapy is positioned as an essential complement to its management. Allowing functional recovery of the joint, it reduces the time of inactivity and improves in the long term, the quality of life of patients.

Block splitting for distributed optimization,"This paper describes a general purpose method for solving convex optimization problems in a distributed computing environment. In particular, if the problem data includes a large linear operator or matrix $$A$$A, the method allows for handling each sub-block of $$A$$A on a separate machine. The approach works as follows. First, we define a canonical problem form called graph form, in which we have two sets of variables related by a linear operator $$A$$A, such that the objective function is separable across these two sets of variables. Many types of problems are easily expressed in graph form, including cone programs and a wide variety of regularized loss minimization problems from statistics, like logistic regression, the support vector machine, and the lasso. Next, we describe graph projection splitting, a form of Douglasâ€“Rachford splitting or the alternating direction method of multipliers, to solve graph form problems serially. Finally, we derive a distributed block splitting algorithm based on graph projection splitting. In a statistical or machine learning context, this allows for training models exactly with a huge number of both training examples and features, such that each processor handles only a subset of both. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only general purpose method with this property. We present several numerical experiments in both the serial and distributed settings.",2014,Mathematical Programming Computation

Bayesian Elastic-Net and Fused Lasso for Semiparametric Structural Equation Models,"SUMMARY: Structural equation models are well-developed statistical tools for multivariate data with latent variables. Recently, much attention has been given to developing structural equation models that account for nonlinear relationships between the endogenous latent variables, the covariates, and the exogenous latent variables. [Guo et al. (2012)], developed a semiparametric structural equation model where the nonlinear functional relationships are approximated using basis expansions and used Bayesian Lasso for simulations analysis and model selection. In this paper we consider semiparametric structural equation models when cubic splines are used for the basis expansion. Cubic splines are known to induce correlations. Bayesian fused Lasso and Bayesian elastic-net are used to account for correlations in both the covariates and basis expansions. We illustrate the usefulness of our proposed methods through a simulation study. The semiparametric structural equation models based on Bayesian fused Lasso and Bayesian elastic-net outperform the Bayesian Lasso model.",2013,

Fatal course in severe meningococcemia: clinical predictors and effect of transfusion therapy.,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether the administration of fresh-frozen plasma to patients with systemic meningococcal disease is associated with an increased mortality rate compared with the administration of plasma substitutes.


DESIGN
Seventeen-year case-control study.


SETTING
Intensive care units and departments of internal medicine and pediatrics of one university hospital and one local hospital.


PATIENTS
A total of 336 patients with culture-proven meningococcemia or symptoms characteristic of meningococcemia who were admitted to two hospitals in northern Norway between 1974 and 1991.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
High-risk patients were selected on the basis of two different scoring systems (Niklasson's score and clinical score) and classified according to the type of intravenous fluid regimen (fresh-frozen plasma, blood, or colloids). For comparison between groups, analysis of variance and chi-square tests were used. Assessments of adjusted effects on mortality rate were done by multiple logistic regression. Administration of blood or plasma was significantly associated with a fatal course, both in the total patient population (p < .01) and in the high-risk group (p = .02), while using colloids alone was negatively associated with death, although not reaching statistical significance. A significantly lower mortality rate was found in one of the hospitals where colloids were used instead of plasma or blood in the last part of the period studied (p < .05).


CONCLUSION
The results support our hypothesis that the use of fresh-frozen plasma may negatively influence outcome in systemic meningococcal disease.",1993,Critical care medicine
BLasso for object categorization and retrieval: Towards interpretable visual models,"We propose a new supervised object retrieval method based on the selection of local visual features learned with the BLasso algorithm. BLasso is a boosting-like procedure that efficiently approximates the Lasso path through backward regularization steps. The advantage compared to a classical boosting strategy is that it produces a sparser selection of visual features. This allows us to improve the efficiency of the retrieval and, as discussed in the paper, it facilitates human visual interpretation of the models generated. We carried out our experiments on the Caltech-256 dataset with state-of-the-art local visual features. We show that our method outperforms AdaBoost in effectiveness while significantly reducing the model complexity and the prediction time. We discuss the evaluation of the visual models obtained in terms of human interpretability.",2012,Pattern Recognit.

PATTERNS OF POLyChAETE wORM INFESTATION OF STONy CORALS IN ThE NORThERN REd SEA ANd RELATIONShIPS TO wATER ChEMISTRy,"Coral reefs of the northern Red Sea are biodiverse and rich in endemisms, but also fragile and susceptible to stress by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Colonies of several genera of reef-building stony corals at Eilat (Israeli Red Sea) recently have become infested with boring spionid polychaete worms, the presence of which has induced skeletal aberrations on corals. Of 656 corals examined, 218 (33.2%) were infested with boring spionid worms. The percent of infested coral colonies in the coral genera Leptastrea and Porites was significantly correlated with the concentration of total oxidized nitrogen (TON, NO2 + NO3) in the water column. TON levels also significantly predicted the likelihood of colony infestation in the corals Leptastrea, Pavona, and Porites, and the likelihood of skeletal aberration in Porites. high abundances of coral-boring polychaetes have been reported in other reef areas close to organic waste discharges. we conclude that anthropogenic nitrogen enrichment of waters surrounding coral reefs at Eilat may have caused corals to become vulnerable to infestation by boring spionid polychaetes, resulting in coral skeleton aberrations and increased susceptibility to damage by storms. The coral reefs at Eilat (Israeli Red Sea, 29Â°N) are situated near the northern limit of reef building by scleractinian (stony) corals. These coral reefs are biodiverse and rich in endemisms (Fishelson, 1995), and are exposed to a number of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. high levels of water circulation (Genin and Paldor, 1998) disperse planktonic larvae along the coast, leading to the occurrence of stony corals and other invertebrates throughout the coastline on shallow coral knolls (patch reefs) and fringing reefs (Loya, 1990). The shallow reefs are affected by occasional winter storms that cause surges of more than 10 m (Friedman, 1968), and dislodge a considerable number of corals (J. wielgus, pers. obs.). historically, organic inputs from phosphate loading at the port, effluent from the adjacent town of Eilat, and oil spills have impacted reefs in the area. There are signs that reefs have not fully recovered from these events (Loya, 1990; Fishelson, 1995, wielgus et al., 2003). Currently reefs also are subjected to intense pressure from recreational SCUBA divers and snorkelers (Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002). Coral cover at Eilat has declined markedly in recent decades (Fishelson, 1995). Two aquaculture facilities produce approximately 2000 t per year of gilthead seabream Sparus aurata (Linnaeus, 1758) (Porter et al., 1996) in cages located at the northern Gulf of Eilat (Fig. 1). They release an estimated 18 Ã— 106 mol N yrâˆ’1 into the water column and are the largest source of N and P to the northern Gulf (Atkinson et al., 2001), where the highest concentrations of inorganic nitrogen off the Eilat coastline are routinely found (B. Lazar, hebrew University of Jerusalem, pers. comm.). The effect on nearby coral reefs of nutrient enrichment by the aquaculture facilities has been vigorously disputed. For example, Bongiorni et al. (2003) suggest that waste from the fish cages does not affect coral health, while Loya and Kramarsky-winter (2003) argue that this source of nutrients is a major factor in coral reef deterioration BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL. 78, NO. 2, 2006 378 at Eilat. deep convective mixing also contributes to the eutrophication of surface waters at Eilat between december and March (Lindell and Post, 1995), which are considered the winter months. It was recently observed that various scleractinian (stony) coral genera at Eilat have become infested with spionid polychaetes (wielgus et al., 2002). Some of these coral colonies have developed aberrant growth forms consisting of projections of the coral skeleton around the polychaete tubes (Fig. 2). Similar coral growth forms induced by boring spionids have been documented in the Caribbean (Lewis, 1998) and the western Pacific (Liu and hsieh, 2000). Boring spionids are among the most common coral reef bioeroders, playing a substantial role in reef destruction (hutchings, 1986), but are found most frequently in coral rock or non-living substrata. To our knowledge, the infestation of live coral colonies belonging to various genera at a single location has not been reported previously. Spionids construct interconnected tunnel networks within the coral skeleton that project as mucus-lined openings on the surface (Lewis, 1998). These boreholes weaken the coral colonies and increase their susceptibility to breakage by wave surge (hein and Risk, 1975; Scott and Risk, 1988). Spionid boreholes also are known to weaken the shells of scallops and to increase their predation by lobsters (Bergman et al., 1982). The abundance of coral-dwelling polychaetes has been positively correlated with proximity to organic waste outfalls (woodwick, 1964; Brock and Smith, 1983; hutchings and Peyrot-Clausade, 2002). however, much of the work done on these worms has concentrated on burrow architecture (e.g., Liu and hsieh, 2000) or on different aspects of polychaete biology including feeding ecology, recruitment, and successional patterns (e.g., hutchings, 1986; hentschel and Larson, 2005). here we report on the abundance of spionids and spionid-induced coral deformations on reef corals at Eilat, and how these varied with the concentration of nitrogen in the surrounding water column. Figure 1. Location of five study sites and two floating fish farms (FF) at Eilat, northern Red Sea. The Military Port was not examined in the preliminary survey, but was included in final surveys. wIELGUS ET AL.: POLyChAETE INFESTATION OF CORALS 379 Materials and Methods Preliminary Survey of Polychaete Infestations.â€”during January 2002 we selected four study sites along the coastline of Eilat (North Beach, Katzaa, Caves, and Taba) to examine scleractinian corals infested with spionid polychaetes (Fig. 1). At a depth of 4â€“6 m at each site we deployed a 50-m line transect around the perimeter of a coral knoll consisting of multiple coral species, and recorded the genus of each scleractinian coral colony lying under the tape. The hydrocoral Millepora (a non-scleractinian) also was included in the surveys because of its important contribution to reef structure at Eilat (Loya and Slobodkin, 1971), and its susceptibility to infestation by spionids (Lewis, 1998). If the circumference of a knoll was < 50 m, the tape was deployed to circumvent it at different distances from the bottom until a 50 m length was achieved. we identified corals only to genus level because: (1) coral species are difficult to identify underwater in the species-rich Red Sea region (Loya, 1972; Sheppard and Sheppard, 1991), and (2) genus-level ecological data on corals does not appear to result in significantly higher variation among sites than does species-level data (Glassom, 2002). Each coral colony was classified as either (1) not infested by spionid worms, or (2) infested (containing spionid tubes). we also recorded the presence of coral aberrations, consisting of skeletal projections around spionid tubes (Lewis, 1998; Liu and hsieh, 2000; see Fig. 2). Spionid tubes are readily differentiated from other boring polychaetes (sabellids, terebellids, serpulids) by their translucent appearance (Fig. 2A), and by standing above the surface of the corallite like tiny â€œchimneysâ€ (day, 1967). when feeding, worms protrude two palps that capture particulate organic matter from the water column and/or the adjacent substrate (Rouse and Pleijel, 2001). we collected two infested colonies of each of the coral genera Porites and Montipora for the taxonomic identification of spionid worms. Coral skeletons were dissolved in 8% hCl, and worms were stored in 70% ethanol. The preserved worms were sent to the Centre dâ€™Estudis AvanÃ§ats de Blanes (Girona, Spain), where they were examined in a hitachi S-3500N scanning electron microscope. Abundance and Size of Infested Coral Colonies.â€”Between February and March 2002 we haphazardly selected three coral knolls at each site, adjacent to those examined in the preliminary survey. In addition, three coral knolls were selected at a fifth site (Military Port, Fig. 1). we extended a measuring tape around the perimeter of each knoll (range of knoll circumference = 14â€“58 m), identified all stony coral colonies lying under the tape to genus level, and estimated the mean projected diameter of each colony by measuring across the colony center in three directions. we also recorded the presence of spionid tubes and associated skeletal aberrations for each measured coral colony. Figure 2. (A) Close-up of a colony of the reef-building coral Montipora at Eilat, northern Red Sea, with skeletal aberrations (wide arrows) resulting from coral growth around the tubes (thin arrow) of boring spionid polychaetes. (B) A colony of the reef-building coral Porites with skeletal aberrations indicated by arrows. The length of each arrow represents 5 cm. BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL. 78, NO. 2, 2006 380 Nitrogen Measurements.â€”we used measurements of total oxidized nitrogen (TON, NO2 + NO3) in our analyses because nitrogen is rapidly oxidized in coral reef waters and concentrates as nitrite and nitrate (Marubini and davies, 1996). water samples were collected and analyzed by the Red Sea Marine Peace Park Program (see Crosby et al., 2000) from each study site every 2â€“4 wks between September 1999 and August 2002. At each site, 31â€“46 water samples were analyzed. water samples were collected from the sea surface using a 5-l Niskin bottle (General Oceanics, Inc.). Concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were measured following protocols in Grasshoff et al. (1999). Briefly, sulphanilamide was added to each seawater sample, and the azo dye that formed when it reacted with nitrite in the sample was quantified using an Ultrospec 2100 UV/visible spectrophotometer. To measure nitrate, granulated cadmium was added to reduce nitrate to n",2010,
Genome selection in fruit breeding: application to table grapes,"Genomic selection (GS) has recently been proposed as a new selection strategy which represents an innovative paradigm in crop improvement, now widely adopted in animal breeding. Genomic selection relies on phenotyping and high-density genotyping of a sufficiently large and representative sample of the target breeding population, so that the majority of loci that regulate a quantitative trait are in linkage disequilibrium with one or more molecular markers and can thus be captured by selection. In this study we address genomic selection in a practical fruit breeding context applying it to a breeding population of table grape obtained from a cross between the hybrid genotype D8909-15 (Vitis rupestris Ã— Vitis arizonica/girdiana), which is resistant to dagger nematode and Pierceâ€™s disease (PD), and â€˜B90-116â€™, a susceptible Vitis vinifera cultivar with desirable fruit characteristics. Our aim was to enhance the knowledge on the genomic variation of agronomical traits in table grape populations for future use in marker-assisted selection (MAS) and GS, by discovering a set of molecular markers associated with genomic regions involved in this variation. A number of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) were discovered but this method is inaccurate and the genetic architecture of the studied population was better captured by the BLasso method of genomic selection, which allowed for efficient inference about the genetic contribution of the various marker loci. The technology of genomic selection afforded greater efficiency than QTL analysis and can be very useful in speeding up the selection procedures for agronomic traits in table grapes.",2016,Scientia Agricola

The Hardware in the Loop Simulation System of Speed Ratio Control on EMCVT,"Currently the realized variable function of the belt-type continuously variable transmission (CVT) is based on engine driving hydraulic system, due to the problems of low efficiency of the pump, valve, hydraulic components, transmission system generates additional energy, at the same time, and reliability is low. In this article, a new, purely electronic mechanical continuously variable transmission (EMCVT) which realized transmission function directly using Dc motor drive system is researched. In order to meet the research of the EMCVT in the process of test requirements, also can be safe and low cost, shorten test cycle, provide the off-line debugging in laboratory environment, complete virtual test of speed ratio control, the research of the hardware in the loop simulation system (HILSS) of speed ratio control on EMCVT as a simulation experiment platform is propounded. The simulation software is developed by HILSS using EMCVT model as the core based on LabVIEW, plus LabVIEW friendly interface, the control system of the virtual bench test and control system of off-line debugging on EMCVT can be easily finished, thus the cost is greatly saved and the cycle of experiment is shortened. Introduction Now automotive belt-type CVT most uses the scheme of hydraulic pressure electronic-hydraulic system, but using pump, valve and hydraulic torque converter etc. hydraulic system to control clamping force and transmission ratio are low efficiency and high failure, result that actual fuel consumption is still not good enough. In this article the EMCVT which uses metal belt as the key component adopting motor, gear and spring with low energy consumption, low cost and high reliability instead of hydraulic system to save energy, reduce the cost and improve the reliability is researched. EMCVT adopts purely electronic mechanical structure; its speed ratio control is to control motor control. But the whole process of the accurate speed ratio control system can be obtained through a lot of field test. Because the field test which is high cost and the long cycle, a set of satisfied test requirements, low cost, simplify, short the cycle test system need be given in the research process of the EMCVT. HILSS is a set of virtual experiment system which can satisfy the field test. As a kind of advanced simulation technology, its appearance has changed the traditional developed methods of control system. By HILSS simulation of the actual operating conditions, the performance of auto control system can be evaluation and off-line test, convenient control system development ways are provided. The Structure of EMCVT Speed Ratio Control System In this article, the EMCVT of Shenyang Yueshida Automobile CVT Company is adopted, its main consists of gear box casing, motor of the clutch control and motor of the speed ratio control.

Comparison of prediction errors: Adaptive p-values after cross-validation,"We develop tools to do valid post-selective inference for a family of model selection procedures, including choosing a model via cross-validated Lasso. The tools apply universally when the following random vectors are jointly asymptotically multivariate Gaussian: 1. the vector composed of scores for each model evaluated under certain model selection criteria (e.g. cross-validation errors across folds, AIC, prediction errors etc.); 2. the test statistics which we use to do inference on the parameter of interest chosen after looking at the selected model. Under these assumptions, we derive a pivotal quantity that has an asymptotically Unif(0,1) distribution which can be used to perform tests and construct confidence intervals. Both the tests and confidence intervals are selectively valid for the chosen parameter. While the above assumptions may not be satisfied in some applications, we propose a novel variation to these model selection procedures by adding Gaussian randomizations to either one of the two vectors. We illustrate our method through adding randomization and applying our technical tools to four important procedures for which no valid selective inference has yet developed: cross-validated Lasso, cross-validated randomized Lasso, AIC-based model selection among a fixed set of models and a population version of LOCO of Rinaldo et al (2016). We also develop MCMC sampling scheme to construct valid post-selective confidence intervals empirically in cases with randomized model selection procedures. Finally, as a side product, we demonstrate via simulation that, with the help of selection-adjusted p-values after cross-validated randomized Lasso, we can achieve high-statistical power and FDR control, yielding results comparable to knockoffs (in simulations favorable to knockoffs), and much better results than non-randomized Lasso.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Comparative Study on Variable Selection Approaches in Establishment of Remote Sensing Model for Forest Biomass Estimation,"In the field of quantitative remote sensing of forest biomass, a prominent phenomenon is the increasing number of explanatory variables. Then how to effectively select explanatory variables has become an important issue. Linear regression model is one of the commonly used remote sensing models. In the process of establishing the linear regression model, a vital step is to select explanatory variables. Focusing on variable selection and model stability, this paper conducts a comparative study on the performance of eight linear regression parameter estimation methods (Stepwise Regression Method (SR), Criterions Based on The Bayes Method (BIC), Criterions Based on The Bayes Method (AIC), Criterions Based on Prediction Error (Cp), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso), Adaptive Lasso, Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD), Non-negative garrote (NNG)) in the subtropical forest biomass remote sensing model development. For the purpose of comparison, OLS and RR, are commonly used as methods with no variable selection ability, and are also compared and discussed. The performance of five aspects are evaluated in this paper: (i) Determination coefficient, prediction error, model error, etc., (ii) significance test about the difference between determination coefficients, (iii) parameter stability, (iv) variable selection stability and (v) variable selection ability of the methods. All the results are obtained through a five ten-fold CV. Some evaluation indexes are calculated with or without degrees of freedom. The results show that BIC performs best in comprehensive evaluation, while NNG, Cp and AIC perform poorly as a whole. Other methods show a great difference in the performance on each index. SR has a strong capability in variable selection, although it is poor in commonly used indexes. The short-wave infrared band and the texture features derived from it are selected most frequently by various methods, indicating that these variables play an important role in forest biomass estimation. Some of the conclusions in this paper are likely to change as the study object changes. The ultimate goal of this paper is to introduce various model establishment methods with variable selection capability, so that we can have more choices when establishing similar models, and we can know how to select the most appropriate and effective method for specific problems.",2019,Remote Sensing
Application of hyperspectral data for assessing peatland forest condition with spectral and texture classification,"Peatland in tropical region is a major CO2 emission source because of peat decomposition and forest fire by human induced activities. Remote sensing is effective tool to monitor environmental condition of peatland and forest ecosystem in peatland. A pixel-based approach is one of the most attractive choices for forest type classification or biomass prediction. The traditional method, however, is not sufficient for using spatial information. The spatial information, such as image texture, is an important factor for identifying objects or types, because a pixel is not independent of its neighbors and its dependence can be useful for classification and biomass prediction in forest regions. In this paper, we used combined data of spectral and spatial information from hyperspectral data (Hymap) to develop a more accurate classification or biomass prediction model. The spatial information was texture data by using Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture measures. Sparse discrimination analysis (SDA) was applied for the classification model, and LASSO regression was applied for the biomass prediction model. The results were compared to find out how the spatial information enhances the classification and biomass prediction. According to the accuracy assessment, both classification and biomass prediction model derived from the combined data performed high accuracy.",2013,2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS
Multimarker and rare variants genomewide association studies for bone weight in Simmental cattle,"Bone weight, defined as the total weight of the bones in all the forequarter and hindquarter joints, can reflect somebody conformation traits and skeletal diseases. To gain a better understanding of the genetic determinants of bone weight, we used a composite strategy including multimarker and rare-marker association to perform genomewide association studies (GWAS) for that character in Simmental cattle. Our strategy consisted of three models: (i) A traditional linear mixed model (LMM) was applied (Q+K-LMM); (ii) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with p-values less than .05 from the LMM were selected to undergo the least absolute shrinkage and selector operator (Lasso) in the second stage (LMM-Lasso); (iii) genes containing two or more rare SNPs were examined by performing the sequence kernel association test (gene-based SKAT). A total of 1,225 cattle were genotyped with an Illumina BovineHD BeadChip containing 770,000 SNPs. After the quality-control procedures, 1,217 individuals with 608,696 common SNPs and 105,787 rare SNPs (with 0.001 < minor allele frequency [MAF] <0.05) remained in the sample for analysis. A traditional LMM successfully mapped three genes associated with bone weight, while LMM-Lasso identified nine genes, which included all genes found by traditional LMM. Only a single gene, EPHB3, surpassed the significance threshold after Bonferroni correction in gene-based SKAT. In conclusion, based on functional annotation and results from previous endeavours, we believe that LCORL, RIMS2, LAP3, PRKAR2B, CHSY1, MAP2K6 and EPHB3 are candidate genes for bone weight. In general, such a comprehensive strategy for GWAS may be useful for researchers seeking to probe the full genetic architecture underlying economic traits in livestock.",2018,Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics

In this paper, we propose a general numerical method to solve the atomic norm denoising problem.

Model Selection Emphasises the Importance of Non-Chromosomal Information in Genetic Studies,"Ever since the case of the missing heritability was highlighted some years ago, scientists have been investigating various possible explanations for the issue. However, none of these explanations include non-chromosomal genetic information. Here we describe explicitly how chromosomal and non-chromosomal modifiers collectively influence the heritability of a trait, in this case, the growth rate of yeast. Our results show that the non-chromosomal contribution can be large, adding another dimension to the estimation of heritability. We also discovered, combining the strength of LASSO with model selection, that the interaction of chromosomal and non-chromosomal information is essential in describing phenotypes.",2015,PLoS ONE

Scaling patterns inform ontogenetic transitions away from cleaning in Thalassoma wrasses.,"In fishes, cleaning is a mutualistic behavior wherein a species will remove and consume ectoparasites from other organisms. More than two-thirds of cleaner fishes display this behavior predominately as juveniles and discontinue cleaning as adults; such species are here referred to as 'facultative cleaners'. Whether allometric changes in morphological traits coincide with ontogenetic shifts away from cleaning is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that transitions away from cleaning are associated with scaling patterns in the feeding apparatus of facultative cleaners, and then compared such patterns with those exhibited by non-cleaner congeners. We measured functional traits related to feeding, such as vertical gape distance, premaxillary protrusion distance and maxillary kinematic transmission coefficient (KT) in each ontogenetic series of 11 Thalassoma wrasses (Labridae). As these fishes predominately capture prey via biting, we modeled bite force using MandibLever (v3.3) to create an ontogenetic trajectory of bite force for each species. Our results indicate that cleaner fishes in Thalassoma, as juveniles, possess jaws with low mobility that exhibit weaker bite forces. Additionally, there was remarkable consistency in the range of body lengths over which we observed significant differences between facultative cleaners and non-cleaners in bite force, vertical gape distance and premaxillary protrusion distance. Through ontogeny, facultative cleaner fishes exhibit positive allometry for a number of functionally important feeding traits, which possibly obviates the need to continue cleaning.",2014,The Journal of experimental biology
Assessing precision of lasso conditional logistic estimates in the case-crossover design,"The case-crossover design introduced by Maclure (1991) is an observational epidemiological study for analyzing the effects of transient exposures on the risk of acute-onset events. This design is based on exclusively selecting subjects that have experienced the event under investigation. The aim is to identify the short-term, transient triggers of event, rather than to identify who is at highest risk of disease. The association between event onset and risk factors is then estimated by comparing exposure during the period of time just prior to the event onset (case period) to the same subject's exposure during one or more control periods. The standard tool for this analysis is conditional logistic regression (Breslow and Day, 1980; Maclure, 1991). Until present, variable selection issues have not received much attention when modeling the risk of an event of interest under the case-crossover design. On the one hand, time-invariant potential confounders are controlled by design. On the other hand, studies in the literature using the case-crossover design are often concerned by few main risk factors. Nevertheless, advances in technology for data collection lead to complex situations such as those involving many predictors. This may also be the case in studies based on the case-crossover design. The lasso procedure (Tibshirani, 1996), which relies on an L1 penalty, has been widely used for accommodating high-dimensional predictors. This approach has also been adapted to conditional logistic regression in the context of matched case-control studies (Avalos, 2009). However, a drawback of LASSO regression is that no measure of uncertainty is provided. In this work we study by simulations the behavior of nonparametric bootstrap percentile confidence intervals in assessing significance of lasso point estimates. We also illustrate the use of this method with some examples under the case-crossover design. 1. Avalos M. (2009) Model selection via the lasso in conditional logistic regression.

On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the strains were found to be closely affiliated with members of the genera Microbulbifer and Thalassomonas. The hybridization values for DNAâ€“DNA relatedness between two of these strains and Microbulbifer reference strains were significantly lower than that accepted as the phylogenetic definition of a species. On the basis of their distinct taxonomic characteristics, six of the isolated strains represent two novel species of the genus Microbulbifer, for which the names Microbulbifer agarilyticus sp. nov. (type strain JAMB A3 5JCM 14708 5DSM 19200) and Microbulbifer thermotolerans sp. nov. (type strain JAMB A94 5JCM 14709 5DSM 19189) are proposed.",2008,
Adaptive Bayesian sparse representation for underwater acoustic signal de-noising,"In this paper we specifically address the problem of denoising and localisation/separation of underwater acoustic sources. There have been a number of approaches to this problem. Here we evaluate a recently proposed adaptive sparse sequential Bayesian approach. This approach extends sparse reconstruction methods to sequential data. This is achieved by extending the classic Bayesian approach to a sequential Maximum a Posterior (MAP) estimation of the signal over time. A sparsity constraint is enforced through the use of a Laplacian like prior at each time step. An adaptively weighted LASSO cost function is sequentially minimised using the new measurement received at each time step. This algorithm was tested on the very challenging Portland03 dataset. This dataset was collected at Portland harbour in the UK using two linear hydrophone arrays laid on the sea floor. The target, a small fishing boat, then performed a number of transits in the harbour in various directions. This dataset is particularly challenging with a lot of noise from both natural and man-made sources. Therefore an effective method of de-noising and localisation is expected to significantly improve the results on this dataset. Our preliminary results show that the Bayesian sparse representation technique is effective in source localisation and denoising on this dataset.",2015,
A study of machine learning regression methods for major elemental analysis of rocks using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy,"Abstract The ChemCam instrument on the Mars Curiosity rover is generating thousands of LIBS spectra and bringing interest in this technique to public attention. The key to interpreting Mars or any other types of LIBS data are calibrations that relate laboratory standards to unknowns examined in other settings and enable predictions of chemical composition. Here, LIBS spectral data are analyzed using linear regression methods including partial least squares (PLS-1 and PLS-2), principal component regression (PCR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), elastic net, and linear support vector regression (SVR-Lin). These were compared against results from nonlinear regression methods including kernel principal component regression (K-PCR), polynomial kernel support vector regression (SVR-Py) and k -nearest neighbor ( k NN) regression to discern the most effective models for interpreting chemical abundances from LIBS spectra of geological samples. The results were evaluated for 100 samples analyzed with 50 laser pulses at each of five locations averaged together. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were employed to evaluate the statistical significance of differences among the nine models using their predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS) to make comparisons. For MgO, SiO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 , CaO, and MnO, the sparse models outperform all the others except for linear SVR, while for Na 2 O, K 2 O, TiO 2 , and P 2 O 5 , the sparse methods produce inferior results, likely because their emission lines in this energy range have lower transition probabilities. The strong performance of the sparse methods in this study suggests that use of dimensionality-reduction techniques as a preprocessing step may improve the performance of the linear models. Nonlinear methods tend to overfit the data and predict less accurately, while the linear methods proved to be more generalizable with better predictive performance. These results are attributed to the high dimensionality of the data (6144 channels) relative to the small number of samples studied. The best-performing models were SVR-Lin for SiO 2 , MgO, Fe 2 O 3 , and Na 2 O, lasso for Al 2 O 3 , elastic net for MnO, and PLS-1 for CaO, TiO 2 , and K 2 O. Although these differences in model performance between methods were identified, most of the models produce comparable results when p Â â‰¤Â 0.05 and all techniques except kNN produced statistically-indistinguishable results. It is likely that a combination of models could be used together to yield a lower total error of prediction, depending on the requirements of the user.",2015,Spectrochimica Acta Part B: Atomic Spectroscopy
Tolloid cleavage activates latent GDF8 by priming the pro-complex for dissociation,"Growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8)/Myostatin is a latent TGF-Î² family member that potently inhibits skeletal muscle growth. Here, we compared the conformation and dynamics of precursor, latent, and Tolloid-cleaved GDF8 pro-complexes to understand structural mechanisms underlying latency and activation of GDF8. Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) of precursor and latent pro-complexes reveals a V-shaped conformation that is unaltered by furin cleavage and sharply contrasts with the ring-like, cross-armed conformation of latent TGF-Î²1. Surprisingly, Tolloid-cleaved GDF8 does not immediately dissociate, but in EM exhibits structural heterogeneity consistent with partial dissociation. Hydrogenâ€“deuterium exchange was not affected by furin cleavage. In contrast, Tolloid cleavage, in the absence of prodomainâ€“growth factor dissociation, increased exchange in regions that correspond in pro-TGF-Î²1 to the Î±1-helix, latency lasso, and Î²1 strand in the prodomain and to the Î²6â€™â€“ Î²7â€™ strands in the growth factor. Thus, these regions are important in maintaining GDF8 latency. Our results show that Tolloid cleavage activates latent GDF8 by destabilizing specific prodomainâ€“growth factor interfaces and primes the growth factor for release from the prodomain.",2017,bioRxiv
The Asymmetrical Brain by Kenneth Hugdahl and Richard J. Davison,"This volume is the second edition of a previous book entitled Brain Asymmetry by the same editors. However, only 5 of the 39 previous authors return, while 16 of the 21 chapters are completely new. In my opinion, this is a positive sign, as it represents an expansion of interest in hemispheric asymmetries as the field of cognitive neuroscience has evolved. There are sections now that include results using neuroimaging and brain stimulation. The introductory section on animal models and basic functions is also a welcome addition. By including these new sections, the volume is much more comprehensive and should appeal to an even wider audience than the previous edition. This expansion is also encouraging, given the tendency for many in cognitive neuroscience research to focus on one area of the brain without regard for hemispheric differences. Inattention to hemispheric asymmetries when it occurs is perhaps understandable in order to make the story simpler, but puzzling, because these asymmetries are the norm rather than the exception. Brain asymmetry is nowhere more obvious than on a neurology ward. Language, perceptual organization, spatial abilities, attention, memory, emotion, decision making, personality, and so on, are more likely to be disrupted from damage to one or the other hemisphere. The asymmetries are seldom subtle and typically affect activities of everyday life. For anyone who has observed these differences, it is refreshing to read a book such as The Asymmetrical Brain with chapters that discuss a variety of issues that have intrigued researchers of hemispheric laterality for generations. Nevertheless, I wonder how one covers such a broad topic under one cover in light of the explosion of new findings revealing the functional significance of more precisely defined areas throughout the brain. As technological advances, such as neuroimaging, have led to theories about relatively small brain regions, such as place and face areas within the fusiform gyrus or shape and color areas within the temporal cortex, one wonders how dividing the brain in half fits in. A publisher could easily develop a series of collected volumes with titles reflecting hemispheric asymmetries in many different regions of interest (e.g., fusiform gyrus, inferior parietal lobe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, etc.). Alternatively, titles might capture asymmetric functions (e.g., face processing, perceptual organization, emotional valance, depression, etc.). There are many different asymmetric functions, and editing a single volume on brain asymmetry seems something akin to editing a single volume on the brain. With such a large menu to choose from, how does an editor decide what to include? I approached the review of The Asymmetrical Brain with this question in mind and with a huge appreciation for how difficult the job must be. I began by making a list of the various topics covered by the chapters included in this collection. Three themes (Vision, Audition, and Emotion) make up the bulk of the volume. Four chapters are devoted to asymmetries in the visual system of the cortex from birds (Gunturkun) to humans (Banich; Laeng, Chris, & Kosslyn; Saron, Foxe, Schroeder, & Vaughan). Three chapters focus on audition (Hugdahl; Oâ€™Leary; Zatoree) and four on emotion (Berridge, Espana, & Stalnaker; Coan & Allen; Heller, Koven, & Miller; Pizzagalli, Shackman, & Davidson). There is one chapter concerning the origins of handedness (Beaton), one on the hippocampus as a potential source for lateralization (Tang), and five discussing asymmetries related to different neurobiological conditions (Bruderâ€”depression; Eckert & Leonardâ€”dyslexia; Green, Sergi, & Kernâ€”schizophrenia; Habib & Robichonâ€”dyslexia; Lassonde & Sauerweinâ€” callosal agenesis). The volume also includes two chapters on methods and analysis techniques (Fristonâ€” functional neuroimaging; Pascual, Leone, & Walshâ€” transcranial magnetic stimulation) and one on anatomical asymmetries ( Jancke & Steinmetz). For someone seeking examples of excellent work on hemispheric asymmetries, with in depth discussions of how different experts in the field approach selected topics and implications of findings for selected questions, the book offers valuable reading. For those seeking a conclusive summary, the volume may fall short. Despite this limitation, any serious student of hemispheric asymmetries will find critical, scholarly, and indepth discussions of fascinating work.

Reactive oxygen species metabolism-based prediction model and drug for patients with recurrent glioblastoma,"BACKGROUND
Tumor recurrence is the main cause of poor prognosis of GBM. Finding the characteristics of recurrent GBM that provide early warning of tumor recurrence can provide guidance for the clinical treatment of recurrent GBM.


RESULTS
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosynthetic processes was significantly elevated in recurrent GBM. The recurrent risk score based on the ROS biosynthetic process was closely related to tumor purity and tumor immune functions. The quantitative risk assessment system could be used to predict the recurrence time of GBM. Gallic acid, a compound with high anti-oxidation activity and low cytotoxicity, was screened as a potential chemotherapy sensitizer for recurrent GBM.


CONCLUSION
The quantitative risk assessment system based on ROS biosynthetic process could be used for early warning of GBM recurrence. Combination of low-dose gallic acid and temozolomide could improve therapeutic outcomes in recurrent GBM.


METHODS
A total of 663 primary and recurrent GBM samples with clinical and microarray data were included in this study. GSVA, LASSO-COX, and Kaplan-Meier survive curve were performed to construct and verify a quantitative risk assessment system for GBM recurrence prediction. An antioxidant capacity test and cell viability test were used to discover potential drugs for recurrent GBM.",2019,Aging (Albany NY)
Rational improvement of the affinity and selectivity of integrin binding of grafted lasso peptides.,"Integrins moderate diverse important functions in the human body and are promising targets in cancer therapy. Hence, the selective inhibition of specific integrins is of great medicinal interest.

Asymptotic normality and optimalities in estimation of large Gaussian graphical models,"The Gaussian graphical model, a popular paradigm for studying relationship among variables in a wide range of applications, has attracted great attention in recent years. This paper considers a fundamental question: When is it possible to estimate low-dimensional parameters at parametric square-root rate in a large Gaussian graphical model? A novel regression approach is proposed to obtain asymptotically efficient estimation of each entry of a precision matrix under a sparseness condition relative to the sample size. When the precision matrix is not sufficiently sparse, or equivalently the sample size is not sufficiently large, a lower bound is established to show that it is no longer possible to achieve the parametric rate in the estimation of each entry. This lower bound result, which provides an answer to the delicate sample size question, is established with a novel construction of a subset of sparse precision matrices in an application of Le Cam's lemma. Moreover, the proposed estimator is proven to have optimal convergence rate when the parametric rate cannot be achieved, under a minimal sample requirement. The proposed estimator is applied to test the presence of an edge in the Gaussian graphical model or to recover the support of the entire model, to obtain adaptive rate-optimal estimation of the entire precision matrix as measured by the matrix $\ell_q$ operator norm and to make inference in latent variables in the graphical model. All of this is achieved under a sparsity condition on the precision matrix and a side condition on the range of its spectrum. This significantly relaxes the commonly imposed uniform signal strength condition on the precision matrix, irrepresentability condition on the Hessian tensor operator of the covariance matrix or the $\ell_1$ constraint on the precision matrix. Numerical results confirm our theoretical findings. The ROC curve of the proposed algorithm, Asymptotic Normal Thresholding (ANT), for support recovery significantly outperforms that of the popular GLasso algorithm.",2015,Annals of Statistics
Variable Selection with Exponential Weights and â„“0-Penalization,"In the context of a linear model with a sparse coefficient vector, exponential weights methods have been shown to be achieve oracle inequalities for prediction. We show that such methods also succeed at variable selection and estimation under the necessary identifiability condition on the design matrix, instead of much stronger assumptions required by other methods such as the Lasso or the Dantzig Selector. The same analysis yields consistency results for Bayesian methods and BIC-type variable selection under similar conditions.",2012,arXiv: Statistics Theory
"Analysis of trade-off relationships between resolution, line edge roughness, and sensitivity in extreme ultraviolet lithography using machine learning","High-volume production of semiconductor devices by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has started since 2019. A high numerical aperture tool is planned to extend the use of EUV lithography. The trade-off relationships between resolution, line edge roughness (LER), and sensitivity are a significant concern for the extendability of EUV lithography. In previous study, the dependences of chemical gradient (an indicator of LER) on the half-pitch of line-and-space patterns, the sensitivity, the sensitizer concentration, and the effective reaction radius for deprotection were investigated using a simulation on the basis of the sensitization and reaction mechanisms of chemically amplified EUV resists. Although the relationships between resolution, LER, and sensitivity were formulated in the half-pitch range lager than 10 nm, they were deviated from the equations in the sub-10 nm half-pitch resolution region. Recently, the application of information science to the material engineering has attracted much attention. In this study, the feasibility of the application of machine learning to the analysis of trade-off relationships was investigated. The sub-10 nm region was fitted well using lasso.",2020,
Machine Learning-Based Prediction Models for 30-Day Readmission after Hospitalization for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"While machine learning approaches can enhance prediction ability, little is known about their ability to predict 30-day readmission after hospitalization for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). We identified patients aged â‰¥40â€‰years with unplanned hospitalization due to COPD in the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, an administrative claims database in Japan, from 2011 through 2016 (index hospitalizations). COPD was defined by ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) readmission measures. The primary outcome was any readmission within 30â€‰days after index hospitalization. In the training set (randomly-selected 70% of sample), patient characteristics and inpatient care data were used as predictors to derive a conventional logistic regression model and two machine learning models (lasso regression and deep neural network). In the test set (remaining 30% of sample), the prediction performances of the machine learning models were examined by comparison with the reference model based on CMS readmission measures. Among 44,929 index hospitalizations for COPD, 3413 (7%) were readmitted within 30â€‰days after discharge. The reference model had the lowest discrimination ability (C-statistic: 0.57 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-0.59]). The two machine learning models had moderate, significantly higher discrimination ability (C-statistic: lasso regression, 0.61 [95% CI 0.59-0.61], pâ€‰=â€‰0.004; deep neural network, 0.61 [95% CI 0.59-0.63], pâ€‰=â€‰0.007). Tube feeding duration, blood transfusion, thoracentesis use, and male sex were important predictors. In this study using nationwide administrative data in Japan, machine learning models improved the prediction of 30-day readmission after COPD hospitalization compared with a conventional model.AbbreviationsADLactivities of daily livingCOPDchronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseCMSCenters for Medicare and Medicaid ServicesDPCDiagnosis Procedure CombinationICD-10-CMInternational Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical ModificationROCreceiver-operating-characteristic.",2019,COPD

Les mÃ¨res des enfants ont Ã©tÃ© randomisÃ©es, au premier contact vaccinal, pour recevoir, ou non un SMS de rappel avant chaque session vaccinale fixÃ©e par la date de naissance de lâ€™enfant. En fin dâ€™Ã©tude, par tÃ©lÃ©phone, on a voulu savoir pourquoi un enfant, malgrÃ© les SMS envoyÃ©s, nâ€™avait pas Ã©tÃ© enregistrÃ© comme correctement vaccinÃ© dans le RIV. Il existait une diffÃ©rence significative entre lâ€™envoi ou non de SMS et la prÃ©sence de lâ€™enfant Ã  la deuxiÃ¨me (p<0,001), troisiÃ¨me (p<0,001), et quatriÃ¨me session PEV (p<0,001). Il existait aussi une relation significative pour la promptitude (rapiditÃ©) Ã  venir faire vacciner lâ€™enfant Ã  la deuxiÃ¨me (p=0,03), troisiÃ¨me (p =0,02), mais pas Ã  la quatriÃ¨me session PEV (p=0,45). Sur les 523 enfants enregistrÃ©s dans le RIV, 77 enfants (14,8 %) nâ€™ont pas Ã©tÃ© retrouvÃ©s dans les registres papier PEV de Colma 1. La principale cause de non complÃ©tude des vaccinations des enfants dans le RIV Ã©tait la poursuite des vaccinations au CSPS voisin de Colma 2 (38 % des cas dÃ©faillants). Lâ€™entretien tÃ©lÃ©phonique a permis de rattraper 55 % des enfants de Colma 1, en retard pour le PEV malgrÃ© les SMS. Un RIV facilite lâ€™envoi de SMS et augmente la complÃ©tude et la promptitude vaccinales. Un RIV, consultable par internet, permettrait de mieux connaÃ®tre lâ€™Ã©tat vaccinal des enfants admis en urgence dans une structure de santÃ©, et de faire un rattrapage vaccinal. Lâ€™abandon des registres papier et la synthÃ¨se des donnÃ©es RIV, envoyÃ©es aux niveaux supÃ©rieurs par internet, sont Ã  recommander pour augmenter la promptitude et lâ€™exactitude des donnÃ©es PEV.

The objective of this study is to measure EPI quickness and completeness of vaccinations after sending call-back SMS to parents through CIR put in place in a health center. In a health center, chosen at random (Colma 1) in the city of Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, West Africa, mothers, at first EPI session, if they had a mobile phone available at hand or in her surrounding, were randomized for receiving, or not, a call-back SMS before following EPI sessions, after child registration on a Francophone CIR (Siloxaneâ€™s Intervax Â©). Mothers, which were sent SMS and did not correctly followed sessions were asked through mobile phone why their child was late for EPI. 523 newborns were included in the study, with 253 whose parents were sent SMS, and 268 being informed of sessions only by ordinary methods. At second EPI session at 2 months of age, there was a statistical significant increase of coverage for children whose parents received SMS (p<0.001). Quickness to come also to this session was significantly shorter when parents received SMS (p=0.03). At third EPI session at 3 months of age, attendance to EPI for children whose parents were sent SMS was significantly better (p<0.001). Quickness to come to this session was shorter for children with SMS (p=0.02). At fourth EPI session at 4 months of age, attendance for children with SMS was significantly better for children whose parents were sent SMS (p<0.001). Quickness to come to this session was better but not significantly different (p=0.49). Out of 101 children registered as late for EPI sessions in Colma 1 CIR, even with call-back SMS, 19 (19%) parents could not be reached on the telephone. 31/82 (38%) mothers had shifted for EPI to a more proximate vaccination center (Colma 2), and 5 (6%) to private or civil servants clinic. 14/82 (17%) mothers had been travelling far from health center. Ten (12%) admitted neglect of EPI sessions. Two (2%) children had deceased, and one mother did not come back to Colma 1 after her childâ€™s AEFI. One child has been dismissed two times of vaccination following recommendation not to open a measles multi-dose vial for a single child, and did not come back. Of 523 children registered in CIR, 77 (14.7%) could not be found in the paper registers of Colma 1. Quickness and completeness for EPI is increased by sending SMS with help of CIR. An official number should be given for each child registered in CIR, consulted by health staff admitting children in urgency, allowing EPI vaccinations completion. With CIR safeguards, CIR should replace paper registers and should be used to send EPI reports by internet at central levels, helping MOH coverage determination and MAPI surveillance. The fall of coverage due to restriction policy not to open a multidose vial for a single child is low. Health staff should institute telephone call-back for badly immunized children registered on CIR and incorporate in it, with SMS call-back, pregnant women, to better complete prenatal sessions and tetanus vaccination.",2015,Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© de pathologie exotique
Adaptive Penalized Estimation of Directed Acyclic Graphs From Categorical Data,"We develop in this article a penalized likelihood method to estimate sparse Bayesian networks from categorical data. The structure of a Bayesian network is represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We model the conditional distribution of a node given its parents by multi-logit regression and estimate the structure of a DAG via maximizing a regularized likelihood. The adaptive group Lasso penalty is employed to encourage sparsity by selecting grouped dummy variables encoding the level of a factor. We develop a blockwise coordinate descent algorithm to solve the penalized likelihood problem subject to the acyclicity constraint of a DAG. When intervention data are available, our method may construct a causal network, in which a directed edge represents a causal relation. We apply our method to various simulated networks and a real biological network. The results show that our method is very competitive, compared to other existing methods, in DAG estimation from both interventional and high-dimensional observational data. We also establish consistency in parameter and structure estimation for our method when the number of nodes is fixed.",2014,arXiv: Methodology

[A new method of sparse feature extraction for stellar spectra].,"The authors propose a novel method of feature extraction for stellar spectra parameterization. The basic procedures are: First, stellar spectra are decomposed by multi-scale Harr wavelet and the coefficients with high-frequency are rejected. Secondly, the optimal features are detected by the lasso algorithm. Finally, we input the optimal feature vector to non-parametric regression model to estimate the atmospheric parameters. Haar wavelet can remove the high-frequency noise from the stellar spectrum. Lasso algorithm can further compress data by analyzing their significance on parameterization and removing redundancy. Experiments show that the proposed Haar+lasso method improves the accuracy and efficiency of the estimation. The authors used this scheme to estimate the atmospheric parameters from a subsample of some 40,000 stellar spectra from SDSS. The accuracies of our predictions (mean absolute errors) for each parameter are 0.0071 dex for log Teff, 0.2252 dex for log g, and 0.1996 dex for [Fe/H]. Compared with the results of the existing literature, this scheme can derive more accurate atmospheric parameters.",2014,Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu

Here, the distribution patterns of heterochromatin, GC-specific chromosome regions and Ag-NORs, and the organization of 18S and 5S rDNA sites of the Atlantic species Thalassoma noronhanum (Boulenger, 1890), Halichoeres poeyi (Steindachner, 1867), Halichoeres radiatus (Linnaeus, 1758), Halichoeres brasiliensis (Bloch, 1791) and Halichoeres penrosei Starks, 1913, belonging to the tribe Julidini were analyzed. All the species exhibited 2n=48 chromosomes with variation in the number of chromosome arms among genera. Thalassoma noronhanum has 2m+46a, while species of the genus Halichoeres RÃ¼ppell, 1835 share karyotypes with 48 acrocentric chromosomes. The Halichoeres species exhibit differences in the heterochromatin distribution patterns and in the number and distribution of 18S and 5S rDNA sites. The occurrence of 18S/5S rDNA syntenic arrangements in all the species indicates a functionally stable and adaptive genomic organization. The phylogenetic sharing of this rDNA organization highlights a marked and unusual chromosomal singularity inside the family Labridae.",2016,Comparative Cytogenetics
Leading and Next-to-Leading Order Gluon Polarisation in the Nucleon and Longitudinal Double Spin Asymmetries from Open Charm Muoproduction The COMPASS Collaboration,"The gluon polarisation in the nucleon was measured using open charm production by scattering 160 GeV/c polarised muons off longitudinally polarised protons or deuterons. The data were taken by the COMPASS collaboration between 2002 and 2007. A detailed account is given of the analysis method that includes the application of neural networks. Several decay channels of D0 mesons are investigated. Longitudinal spin asymmetries of the D meson production cross-sections are extracted in bins of D0 transverse momentum and energy. At leading order QCD accuracy the average gluon polarisation is determined as ã€ˆâˆ†g/gã€‰LO = âˆ’0.06Â± 0.21 (stat.)Â± 0.08 (syst.) at the scale ã€ˆÎ¼2ã€‰ â‰ˆ 13(GeV/c)2 and an average gluon momentum fraction ã€ˆxã€‰ â‰ˆ 0.11.

An unusual echodensity in the ascending aorta: transesophageal echocardiographic visualization of a protruding coronary stent.,"A 73-yr-old woman with a history of single-vessel coronary artery disease presented for off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Almost 2 yr before her presentation, she underwent placement of a paclitaxel drug-eluting stent (Taxus, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) in an ostial right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis. She required two further interventions to this stent 1 and 12 mo after the initial stent placement. In both instances, the patient developed anginal symptoms and cardiac catheterization revealed occlusion of the intracoronary stent. In both cases, a new coronary artery stent was placed within the lumen of the previous stent after successful balloon dilation. Two days before surgery, she presented with unstable angina and coronary angiography revealed re-occlusion of the RCA stent(s). A wire could not be placed into the lumen of the stent(s) during the catheterization, and the patient was referred for surgery. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) performed after anesthesia induction demonstrated moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, mild aortic regurgitation, and an almost 1-cm long, lasso-shaped echodensity in the proximal ascending aorta just distal to the aortic valve leaflets (Fig. 1). Further examination revealed the mass to emanate from the RCA ostium and to limit systolic motion of the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve. On the basis of these findings, the surgical procedure was changed to a CABG, mitral valve repair, and exploration of the ascending aorta. Exploration of the ascending aorta revealed the echodense mass to be a coronary stent protruding approximately 7 mm into the aorta from the RCA ostium. The right coronary cusp displayed fibrotic changes at the point of contact with the stent. The stent was cut at the point of emanation and removed (Fig. 2). The patient then underwent successful CABG of the RCA and mitral valve annuloplasty. This report describes an unusual echodensity in the ascending aorta found during intraoperative TEE. This finding had direct impact on the surgical plan and procedure.

"Fishes in the forested flood plain of the Ochlockonee River, Florida, during flood and drought conditions","A study of hydrologic conditions, vegetation, and fishes was made in the Ochlockonee River and flood plain in northwest Florida from 1987 to 1989. The study was conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission to document the importance of the flood-plain environment to fishes. A total of 8,225 fish belonging to 15 families and 48 species was collected during the study in flood-plain, backwater, and main channel habitats by five different sampling methods. During floods, three-quarters of the fish species known to occur in the main channel were collected in the flood plain. The most frequently collected species in the flood plain during floods were weed shiner (Notropis texanus), redbreast sunfish (Lepomis auritus), brown bullhead (Ictalurus nebulosus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), and redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus). The study period included a drought during which flood-plain ponds were isolated from the river for 10 to 14 months. Thirteen species found in isolated flood-plain ponds had survived low dissolved-oxygen concentrations the preceding fall. Flier (Centrarchus macropterus), pirate perch (Aphredoderus sayanus), mosquitofish, and warmouth (Lepomis gulosus) were the most frequently collected drought pond species. Seven common flood-plain species that were rare or absent in the main channel apparently depend on flood-plain, backwater, and tributary habitats for their survival in this river system: flier, banded pygmy sunfish (Elassoma zonatum), bluespotted sunfish (Enneacanthus gloriosus), least killifish (Heterandria formosa), taillight shiner (Notropis maculatus), redfin pickerel (Esox americanus americanus}, and brown bullhead. The annual flood season of the Ochlockonee River typically occurs in January, February, March, and April. Summer floods are common but usually of shorter duration than winter-spring floods. Typical range in stage is 16 feet from the low to the high for the year. Alluvial flood-plain processes such as erosion and sediment deposition create topographic relief on the flood-plain surface that allows diverse habitats to develop. Riverbank levees and terraces serve as berms during low and medium river stages, separating still-water habitats in ponds and depressions from the flowing waters of the main channel. During high river stage, all areas of the flood plain are covered with flowing water. Tree communities were distinctly different in each topographic zone, reflecting the varied hydrologic conditions existing within the flood plain. High terraces supported a mixture of canopy species including spruce pine (Pinus glabra), sweetgum (Liquidambarstyraciflua), live oak (Quercus virginiana), and water oak (Quercus nigra), and were flooded an average of 2 to 3 weeks a year from 1931 to 1989. Low terraces, dominated by a canopy of swamp laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), were normally flooded a total of 2 to 4 months a year. The dominant canopy species in depressions was Ogeechee tupelo (Nyssa ogeche), with bald-cypress (Taxodium distichum) the most common associate. Depressions were typically flooded by the river a total of 3 to 5 months a year, but water was often trapped in these areas long after floods receded. Live and dead vegetative structure in the flood plain, and the amount of time it was flooded, varied with topographic zone and season. The fluctuating hydrologic conditions of the river-flood-plain system, along with the variety of alluvial features and tree communities, contribute to diversity in the fish community. During low water, flood-plain ponds support a fish community distinctly different from that of flowing waters of the main channel. During high water, flood-plain ponds mix with flood waters, and all river-flood-plain fishes gain access to diverse forest habitats.",1991,Water-Resources Investigations Report
Green turtle diet is dominated by seagrass in the Western Indian Ocean except amongst gravid females,"Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) are key herbivores of tropical and subtropical neritic habitats and play a major role in structuring seagrass meadows. We present the first detailed assessment of green turtle diet in the Western Indian Ocean using the gut contents of salvaged animals from three atolls in the Republic of Seychelles separated from each other by 400â€“825Â km: Cosmoledo (adults, nâ€‰=â€‰12), Farquhar (adults, nâ€‰=â€‰33; immature, nâ€‰=â€‰1) collected in 1982â€“1983; and Desroches (immatures, nâ€‰=â€‰8) in 2016â€“2018. We report the first comparison of the diets of gravid females (nâ€‰=â€‰17), males (nâ€‰=â€‰26) and non-breeding females (nâ€‰=â€‰2) at sites providing both foraging and breeding habitat. Seagrass (mostly Thalassodendron ciliatum) dominated the diet, accounting for 95% of the mean gut content biomass for males and non-breeding females but only 58% for gravid females, alongside relatively large amounts of substrate (14%) and macroalgae (13%). Satellite tracking of post-nesting green turtles from Chagos Archipelago in 2016 located foraging sites at Farquhar Atoll that coincided with capture locations of 26 of the 33 adult turtles sampled there in 1983. In situ surveys of those sites in 2018 revealed extensive nearly monospecific beds of T. ciliatum. The prominence of seagrass in the diet of green turtles and connectivity between foraging and nesting habitats throughout the region illustrate the need to conserve and monitor seagrass habitats of the Western Indian Ocean especially in the context of changing green turtle population densities.",2019,Marine Biology
Effect of fish removal on the abundance and size structure of the sea urchin Diadema antillarum: A field experiment,"AbstractThree decades after its population collapse, the sea urchin Diadema antillarum has yet to return to pre-mortality densities in most Caribbean localities. Circumstantial evidence suggests high post-settlement mortality due to predation as a potential mechanism to explain the lack of, or the slow recovery of this sea urchin. In this study we experimentally reduced the densities of two reef fish, Thalassoma bifasciatum and Halichoeres bivittatus, at one site for one year and measured the effect of their removal in the abundances and size structures of D. antillarum in relation to that of a comparable control site. We hypothesized a significant increase in urchin abundance and a reduction in mean test diameter at the experimental site with respect to the control site after the reduction in fish abundance. Overall, the density of D. antillarum did not vary significantly between control and experimental sites for the different census periods. Fish removal had a significant effect on the size structure o...",2015,Marine Biology Research
"Signal Flies of the genus Duomyia (Diptera: Platystomatidae) in the Northern Territory, Australia","A key is given to the species of Duomyia Walker, 1849, (approximately 26) recognized in the Northern Territory of Australia. The following new species are described: D. nodosa, D. rapida, D. grahami, D. tricurva, D. bucina, D. recta, D. prensans, D. praeflava, D. korneyevi, D. lana, D. collessi, D. maceveyi, D. whittingtoni. Duomyia sericea Hendel and D. serra McAlpine are newly recorded for the Northern Territory; D. foliata McAlpine is newly recorded for New South Wales; D. tomentosa Hendel is newly recorded for Western Australia; and D. eremia McAlpine is newly recorded for South Australia. The question of possible recent extinction of D. irregularis Malloch is raised, and the urgent need to establish the population status of other rarely seen species is mentioned. Mcalpine, DaviD K. 2012. Signal flies of the genus Duomyia (Diptera: Platystomatidae) in the Northern Territory, Australia. Records of the Australian Museum 64(2): 121â€“148. Nine of the 26 recorded Australian genera of Platystomatidae, or signal flies, are known in the Northern Territory, viz. Achias, Aetha, Duomyia, Elassogaster, Euprosopia, Lamprogaster, Plagiostenopterina, Rhytidortalis, and Rivellia (see McAlpine, 2001, for key to genera). This compares with 25 genera living in Queensland, and illustrates the decline in wet forest taxonomic diversity, as one proceeds from east to west in the Australian tropics, and a degree of isolation of the NT seasonally wet zone from that of the eastern Australian tropics. The endemic Australian platystomatid genus Duomyia includes 70 previously described species (see McAlpine, 1973, 2001, 2011), but study of collections indicates that over 110 species exist. About 26 species are here recognized for the NT, of which 13 appear to be endemic to the Territory. Several apparent species, represented by material that is inadequate for precise characterization, are assigned provisional numbers. The larger number of Duomyia species in the NT compared with that in other NT platystomatid genera correlates with the ability of numerous Duomyia species to survive in relatively dry climates. By contrast, the genus Euprosopia has only two species in the NT, compared with at least 29 species in the Queensland tropics (some undescribed). Duomyia irregularis Malloch, from vicinity of Darwin, has apparently not been collected for more than 100 years (see p. 147). As it is a small, inconspicuous insect and recent collecting in the area has not been thorough, I do not regard this as firm evidence of extinction. The following species have each been collected on only one occasion: Duomyia rapida n.sp., D. bucina n.sp., D. prensans n.sp., D. lana n.sp.; also, some other species are known from very few specimens. Investigation of the population status of these insects by locally resident entomologists is needed. A summary of general information on the genus Duomyia, including generic synonymy and a little information on habits and ecology, was previously given (McAlpine, 2001). A key to species was given by McAlpine (1973, supplemented by McAlpine, 2011). The division of such a large genus as Duomyia into subgenera or species groups seems desirable, but this desideratum has not yet proved attainable. Although there are some small groups of evidently related species, many other species do not readily fit into groups or are intermediate between such groups. Malloch (1929) proposed the subgenus Duomyza for D. tomentosa Hendel. Some species are closely",2012,Records of The Australian Museum
Multiuser detection by MAP estimation with sum-of-absolute-values relaxation,"In this article, we consider multiuser detection that copes with multiple access interference caused in star-topology machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. We assume that the transmitted signals are discrete-valued (e.g. binary signals taking values of Â±1), which is taken into account as prior information in detection. We formulate the detection problem as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, which is relaxed to a convex optimization called the sum-of-absolute-values (SOAV) optimization. The SOAV optimization can be efficiently solved by a proximal splitting algorithm, for which we give the proximity operator in a closed form. Numerical simulations are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the linear minimum mean-square-error (LMMSE) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods.",2016,2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)
"Abstract MP38: Local Population Income, Geographic Space and Interactions Predict Increased Presence of Physical Activity Facilities in New York City Metropolitan Area Census Tracts, 1990-2010","Introduction: Physical activity is associated with improved health and is supported, in part, by the presence of facilities that provide space and equipment to pursue a variety of physical activities. We assessed the hypothesis that socio-geographic characteristics predict increased local availability of commercial physical activity facilities over time. Longitudinal examination of physical activity facility distribution can inform our response to current disparities in access to public and private physical activity venues. Methods: We used data from the National Establishment Time-Series (NETS), a longitudinal database of U.S. businesses, focusing on 4528 census tracts (23 counties) in the New York City metropolitan area and on decennial intervals for which population data were also available through the Census or American Community Survey (1990, 2000, 2010). Commercial physical activity facilities (e.g., gyms, tennis courts, martial arts studios) were defined based on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and name searches. Facility counts were aggregated to 2010 census tract boundaries and linked to local population characteristics. Comparisons across decennial intervals were used to define increasing count of physical activity facilities and shifting population demographics. Associations were evaluated using lasso logistic regression to estimate relationships with predictor variables and their interactions with model shrinkage and variable subset selection through 10-fold cross-validation for minimization of test set model deviance. Results: Census tracts with at least one physical activity facility increased over time (1990=1172, 2000=2295, 2010=2365). Greater tract-level median income, larger land area, and higher previous total physical activity facilities at start of decade were positively associated with greater odds for local increase in physical activity facilities (OR=1.27 per SD median income; OR=1.30 per SD land area; OR=1.14 per SD lagged facility count). Inclusion of two-way interaction terms increased R2 estimates from 0.30 to 0.33, suggesting explanation of an additional 3% of the variation in facility count increase. Subset selection through lasso to minimize cross-validation error resulted in retention of 11 of 21 possible two-way predictor interactions. The association between 10-year increase in median income with increased physical activity facility count was stronger in geographically larger census tracts (interaction OR=1.05); similarly, a stronger relationship was found for 10-year population count increase with physical facility count increase in larger census tracts (interaction OR=1.05). Conclusion: Local population, geographic, and business environment characteristics are associated with change in physical activity facilities. Inclusion of interaction terms improved prediction.",2015,Circulation
