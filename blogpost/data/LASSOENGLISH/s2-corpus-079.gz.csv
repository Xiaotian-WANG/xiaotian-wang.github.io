Genetic biomarkers associated with changes in quality of life and pain following palliative radiotherapy in patients with bone metastases.,"BACKGROUND
Patients with bone metastases undergoing palliative radiation therapy (RT) may experience changes in both the functional and symptomatic aspects of quality of life (QOL). The European Organization of Cancer Research and Treatment (EORTC) QOL Questionnaire Core-15 Palliative (QLQ-C15-PAL) is a validated questionnaire employed to assess QOL specifically in palliative patients. Our study aimed to identify single-nucleotide variant (SNV) genetic biomarkers associated with changes in QOL and pain.


METHODS
Fifty-two patients who received a single 8-Gy RT for painful bone metastases completed the EORTC QOL-C15-PAL questionnaire prior to randomization and at 42-day post RT. Saliva samples obtained at day of RT were sequenced, and SNVs from genes involved in inflammation, radiation response, immune response, DNA damage, or QOL were assessed for association with changes in global QOL or the pain scale items using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. The penalized LASSO method with minimum Bayesian information criterion was used to select a multi-SNV model out of significant SNVs (P<0.005) and to produce prognostic scores for patients that categorized them into risk groups of low, middle, and high.


RESULTS
The multivariable model predicting global QOL included 14 SNVs, of which HS1BP3 rs35579164 G:C and ABCA1 rs2230805 C>T had the largest positive and negative effect sizes, respectively (HS1BP3: 8.21, ABCA1: -3.44). The model for the response of QOL pain item included 8 SNVs, of which PLAUR rs4760 A>G and ELAC2rs11545302 had the largest positive and negative effect sizes, respectively (PLAUR: 5.23; ELAC: -3.84). The patients' risk groups were highly predictive of QOL response (P<0.0001) and pain item response (P<0.0001). In logistic regression analysis accounting for baseline factors of gender and primary cancer site, the global QOL risk group predicts pain response after RT [OR: 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-3.9, P=0.015], but the QOL pain item risk group did not (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.5-1.6, P=0.79). The multi-SNVs model included SNVs from genes involved in metabolism, membrane transport, cell cycle control, ciliary structure, and gene expression regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
SNVs were significantly associated with changes in global QOL of global domain and pain item in patients with bone metastases. Identification of genetic biomarkers predictive of QOL items may allow patients and health care providers anticipate and better address the needs of the palliative cancer patient population.",2017,Annals of palliative medicine
Output Feature Augmented Lasso,"Lasso simultaneously conducts variable selection and supervised regression. In this paper, we extend Lasso to multiple output prediction, which belongs to the categories of structured learning. Though structured learning makes use of both input and output simultaneously, the joint feature mapping in current framework of structured learning is usually application-specific. As a result, ad hoc heuristics have to be employed to design different joint feature mapping functions for different applications, which results in the lackness of generalization ability for multiple output prediction. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose to augment Lasso with output by decoupling the joint feature mapping function of traditional structured learning. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: 1) The augmented Lasso conducts regression and variable selection on both the input and output features, and thus the learned model could fit an output with both the selected input variables and the other correlated outputs. 2) To be more general, we set up nonlinear dependencies among output variables by generalized Lasso. 3) Moreover, the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) with Alternating Direction Minimizing (ADM) strategy is used to find the optimal model parameters. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2014,2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining
An Immune-Related Signature Predicts Survival in Patients With Lung Adenocarcinoma,"We investigated the local immune status and its prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma. In total, 513 lung adenocarcinoma samples from TCGA and ImmPort databases were collected and analyzed. The R package coxph was employed to mine immune-related genes that were significant prognostic indicators using both univariate and multivariate analyses. The R software package glmnet was then used for Lasso Cox regression analysis, and a prognosis prediction model was constructed for lung adenocarcinoma; clusterProfiler was selected for functional gene annotations and KEGG enrichment analysis. Finally, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features or signaling pathways were established. Sixty-four immune-related genes remarkably correlated with patient prognosis and were further applied. Samples were hierarchically clustered into two subgroups. Accordingly, the LASSO regression algorithm was employed to screen the 14 most representative immune-related genes (PSMD11, PPIA, MIF, BMP5, DKK1, PDGFB, ANGPTL4, IL1R2, THRB, LTBR, TNFRSF1, TNFRSF17, IL20RB, and MC1R) with respect to patient prognosis. Then, the prognosis prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma patients (namely, the RiskScore equation) was constructed, and the training set samples were incorporated to evaluate the efficiency of this model to predict and classify patient prognosis. Subsequently, based on functional annotations and KEGG pathway analysis, the 14 immune-related genes were mainly enriched in pathways closely associated with lung adenocarcinoma and its immune microenvironment, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection. Furthermore, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features of the training set samples and signaling pathways (such as p53, cell cycle, and DNA repair) were also demonstrated. Finally, the test set sample data were employed for independent testing and verifying the model. We established a prognostic prediction RiskScore model based on the expression profiles of 14 immune-related genes, which shows high prediction accuracy and stability in identifying immune features. This could provide clinical guidance for the diagnosis and prognosis of different immunophenotypes, and suggest multiple targets for precise advanced lung adenocarcinoma therapy based on subtype-specific immune molecules.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Integration of multiple key molecules in lung adenocarcinoma identifies prognostic and immunotherapeutic relevant gene signatures.,"BACKGROUND
Although multiple key molecules in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) have been identified in recent years, the overall tumor microenvironment (TME) immune cell infiltration characterizations mediated by multiple key molecules remain little known. This study aimed to integrate the roles of multiple key molecules to evaluate patient prognosis and TME cell infiltration characterization as well as responses to immunotherapy.


METHODS
Using combined LUAD cancer cohorts with 228 normal samples and 913 tumor samples, we comprehensively dissected the differences of genomic and TME cell infiltration landscapes between normal lung tissues and tumor tissues. The single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used to quantify the relative abundance of 24 cell infiltration. The riskScore signature was constructed using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression mode.


RESULTS
Seven novel key molecules with significantly up-regulated expression in LUAD were determined. Survival analyses revealed their important prognostic values. LUAD microenvironment presented a markedly decreased infiltration of immune cells compared to normal lung tissues. We found tumors with up-regulated expression of these key molecules exhibited a significantly decreased TME cell infiltration and increased immune checkpoint molecule expression. The high riskScore subtype was characterized by decreased innate and adaptive immune cell infiltration. Activation of p53 signaling pathway and regulator T cells were observed in the high riskScore subtype, which were regarded as T-cell suppressive and could be responsible for poorer prognosis in this subtype (HR 1.83(1.27-2.63)). Multivariate analyses demonstrated the riskScore was a robust and independent prognostic biomarker, and its value in predicting immunotherapeutic outcomes was also confirmed (HR 1.70(1.22-2.37)).


CONCLUSIONS
This study reveal a novel gene signature significantly related to patient prognosis and TME cell infiltration in LUAD. We demonstrated the integrated roles of multiple key molecules played a crucial role in shaping TME cell infiltration diversity and complexity. Evaluating the integrated characterization of multiple key molecules could contribute to predicting patients' response to immunotherapy and guiding more effective immunotherapy strategies.",2020,International immunopharmacology
Segmentation Over Detection via Optimal Sparse Reconstructions,"This paper addresses the problem of semantic segmentation, where the possible class labels are from a predefined set. We exploit top-down guidance, i.e., the coarse localization of the objects and their class labels provided by object detectors. For each detected bounding box, figure-ground segmentation is performed and the final result is achieved by merging the figure-ground segmentations. The main idea of the proposed approach, which is presented in our preliminary work, is to reformulate the figure-ground segmentation problem as sparse reconstruction pursuing the object mask in a nonparametric manner. The latent segmentation mask should be coherent subject to sparse error caused by intra-category diversity; thus, the object mask is inferred by making use of sparse representations over the training set. To handle local spatial deformations, local patch-level masks are also considered and inferred by sparse representations over the spatially nearby patches. The sparse reconstruction coefficients and the latent mask are alternately optimized by applying the Lasso algorithm and the accelerated proximal gradient method. The proposed formulation results in a convex optimization problem; thus, the global optimal solution is achieved. In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis of the convergence and optimality. We also give an extended numerical analysis of the proposed algorithm and a comprehensive comparison with the related semantic segmentation methods on the challenging PASCAL visual object class object segmentation datasets and the Weizmann horse dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a competitive performance when compared with the state of the arts.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology

DSRIG: Incorporating graphical structure in the regularized modeling of SNP data,"Genetic selection of farm animals plays an important role in genetic improvement programs. Regularized regression methods on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a set of candidate genes can help to identify genes that are associated with the trait of interest. This complex task must also consider the relative effect sizes on the desired trait and account for the relationships among the candidate SNPs so that selection of a SNP does not promote other undesirable traits through breeding. We present the Doubly Sparse Regression Incorporating Graphical structure (DSRIG), a novel regularized method for genetic selection that exploits the relationships among candidate SNPs to improve prediction. DSRIG was applied in the prediction of skatole and androstenone levels, two compounds known to be associated with boar taint. DSRIG was shown to provide a predictive benefit when compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in a cross-validation procedure. The relative sizes of the coefficient estimates over the cross-validation procedure were compared to determine which SNPs may have the greatest impact on expression of the boar taint compounds and a consensus graph was used to infer the relationships among SNPs.",2019,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology
Identification of a sixteen-microRNA signature as prognostic biomarker for stage II and III colon cancer,"Despite advances in colon cancer research and novel therapies, high risk of recurrence remains a major challenge. This study reports miRNA expression profiling as a biomarker for the prognosis of TNM stage II and III colon cancer. Fresh frozen biopsies from the study cohort (N=111) were analyzed for miRNA by RT-qPCR and LASSO regression analysis was used to build a classifier of miRNAs. The prognostic accuracy was tested and the classifier was validated in an independent colon cohort (TCGA-COAD, N=209). The LASSO regression analysis identified a 16-miRNA signature including miR-143-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-31-5p, miR-181a-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-30d-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-210-3p, miR-25-3p, miR-196a-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR-222-3p, miR-30c-5p and miR-223-3p. A low 16-miRNA signature was associated with better 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) in the study cohort than a high signature (93 % versus 58 %; p< 0.001). The signature was an independent prognostic factor for better 5-year DFS in multivariate analyses (HR 21.4; 95% CI: 4.21-108.7; p< 0.001). The results in the validation cohort were consistent with the study cohort in univariate (77 % versus 65 %; p= 0.045) and multivariate analyses (HR 2.0; 95% CI: 1.04-3.89; p=0.039). We identified a 16-miRNA signature as a reliable prognostic biomarker for classification of colon cancer stage II and III patients into groups with low and high risk for recurrence.",2017,Oncotarget
ensr: R Package for Simultaneous Selection of Elastic Net Tuning Parameters,"Motivation: Elastic net regression is a form of penalized regression that lies between ridge and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The elastic net penalty is a powerful tool controlling the impact of correlated predictors and the overall complexity of generalized linear regression models. The elastic net penalty has two tuning parameters: ${\lambda}$ for the complexity and ${\alpha}$ for the compromise between LASSO and ridge. The R package glmnet provides efficient tools for fitting elastic net models and selecting ${\lambda}$ for a given ${\alpha}.$ However, glmnet does not simultaneously search the ${\lambda} - {\alpha}$ space for the optional elastic net model. 
Results: We built the R package ensr, elastic net searcher. enser extends the functionality of glment to search the ${\lambda} - {\alpha}$ space and identify an optimal ${\lambda} - {\alpha}$ pair.

The Feasibility and Efficacy of a Large-Sized Lasso Catheter Combined With 3 Dimensional Mapping System for Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
We aimed to investigate whether a large-sized Lasso catheter could increase the success rate of immediate complete pulmonary vein (PV) antral isolation and improve the outcome of catheter ablation in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.


SUBJECTS AND METHODS
This study included 107 consecutive patients (67 males, mean age: 57.8Â±9.7 years) who underwent PV mapping and ablation due to symptomatic drug-refractory AF. The first 43 patients underwent isolation of both ipsilateral PVs using the Carto-Merge 3 dimensional mapping system (group 1). The other 64 patients underwent isolation of both ipsilateral PVs using the same technique with a large-sized (a diameter of 30 to 35 mm) Lasso cathe-ter (group 2). When ipsilateral PVs did not show any potential after the initial circumferential ablation, we defined this as 'immediate complete antral isolation (ICAI)'. We compared the AF recurrence rate of both groups.


RESULTS
There was no significant difference of the clinical characteristics between group 1 and group 2. All the patients were followed-up for 1 year. The ICAI rate of group 1 and group 2 was significantly different (21% vs. 78%, p<0.001), and the AF recurrence rates of group 1 and group 2 were also different (34.9% vs. 18.8%, p=0.042). Using multiple logistic regression analysis, the use of a large-sized Lasso catheter was a significant predictive factor for preventing recurrence (odds ratio: 0.489, 95% confidence interval: 0.136-0.927).


CONCLUSION
It is likely that a large-sized Lasso catheter plays an important role in achieving ICAI and in lowering the rate of AF recurrence.",2011,Korean Circulation Journal

Mirror Prox Algorithm for Multi-Term Composite Minimization and Alternating Directions,"In the paper, we develop a composite version of Mirror Prox algorithm for solving convex-concave saddle point problems and monotone variational inequalities of special structure, allowing to cover saddle point/variational analogies of what is usually called ""composite minimization"" (minimizing a sum of an easy-to-handle nonsmooth and a general-type smooth convex functions ""as if"" there were no nonsmooth component at all). We demonstrate that the composite Mirror Prox inherits the favourable (and unimprovable already in the large-scale bilinear saddle point case) $O(1/\epsilon)$ efficiency estimate of its prototype. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can be naturally applied to Lasso-type problems with several penalizing terms (e.g. acting together $\ell_1$ and nuclear norm regularization) and to problems of the structure considered in the alternating directions methods, implying in both cases methods with the $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ complexity bounds.",2013,ArXiv
Methods of Machine Learning for Censored Demand Prediction,"In this paper, we analyze a new approach for demand prediction in retail. One of the significant gaps in demand prediction by machine learning methods is the unaccounted sales data censorship. Econometric approaches to modeling censored demand are used to obtain consistent and unbiased estimates of parameters. These approaches can also be transferred to different classes of machine learning models to reduce the prediction error of sales volume. In this study we build two ensemble models to predict demand with and without demand censorship, aggregating predictions for machine learning methods such as Linear regression, Ridge regression, LASSO and Random forest. Having estimated the predictive properties of both models, we test the best predictive power of the models with accounting for the censored nature of demand.",2018,
Spa techniques and technologies: from the past to the present,"Thermal waters have been used from ancient times. From those early experiences and the consecutive improvements in the understanding and treatment of these waters, all around the world different cultures and communities have used natural structures or have built facilities for the best use and exploitation of the mineral spring water. Nowadays thermal spas, inheritors of a rich and long tradition from the ancient world, combine classical techniques with innovative proposals. Thus, the introduction and implementation of new technologies in bathtubs, swimming pools, showers, saunas, etc., allow the efficient optimization of thermal techniques and hydrotherapy facilities. Moreover, the development of health tourism offers a new way to understand the use of thermal water, which requires higher quality and specialization of the spa services. Every year thousands of people travel to Europe for a healthy holiday and to improve their welfare and wellbeing. Resorts, spas, thalassotherapy centers and thermal spas that use hot thermal water utilize bath techniques, respiratory applications, pressure techniques, wraps, etc. These techniques use facilities and amenities such as swimming pools, bathtubs, showers, sprays and stoves, among others. One can also find peloids (thermal mud) and any kind of clay and herbal wraps. From the practices developed in Roman times, but especially from the first hydrotherapy techniques described by Priessnitz until today, there have been numerous innovations that have enabled the spas to adapt to the demands and needs of a new type of customer. Nowadays, there are companies specializing in the design and innovation of hydrotherapy that favour the modernization of existing spas or the emergence of new spas. The highlights are control and automation; new materials; design and architecture designed by prestigious architects.",2019,Sustainable Water Resources Management

Comparing high-dimensional confounder control methods for rapid cohort studies from electronic health records,"Aims: Electronic health records (EHR), containing rich clinical histories of large patient populations, can provide evidence for clinical decisions when evidence from trials and literature is absent. To enable such observational studies from EHR in real time, particularly in emergencies, rapid confounder control methods that can handle numerous variables and adjust for biases are imperative. This study compares the performance of 18 automatic confounder control methods. Methods: Methods include propensity scores, direct adjustment by machine learning, similarity matching and resampling in two simulated and one real-world EHR datasets. Results & conclusion: Direct adjustment by lasso regression and ensemble models involving multiple resamples have performance comparable to expert-based propensity scores and thus, may help provide real-time EHR-based evidence for timely clinical decisions.

"Ecology of reproduction of Anopheles arabiensis in an urban area of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso (West Africa): Monthly swarming and mating frequency and their relation to environmental factors","Swarming is a key part of the natural system of reproduction of anopheline mosquito populations, and a better understanding of swarming and mating systems in a targeted species in its natural habitat would contribute to better design control strategies with a greater chance of success. Our study investigated the monthly occurrence of swarming and the mating frequency (within swarms) of Anopheles arabiensis in Dioulassoba, Burkina Faso and their relationship with local environmental factors. Mosquitoes collected from swarms were described in terms of body size, recent sugar meal intake, and female repletion, insemination, and Plasmodium falciparum infection status. Swarms of An. arabiensis were found in each month of the year. Both start and end times of swarming varied significantly between months, correlating with the time of sunset. Swarming mostly started after or coincided with sunset from late July to early October but occurred before sunset from late October to early July. Swarming duration, the number of mosquitoes and mating pairs per swarm, and time to first mating were significantly different between months in an inverse relationship with the monthly rainfall. The number of mating pairs was strongly and positively correlated with swarm size. Almost all the females caught in copula were inseminated but a very few were blood fed; no P. falciparum infection was observed. Males caught in copula and in solo were similar in body size and in the proportion which had taken a recent sugar meal. Our investigations showed that An. arabiensis reproductive activities are most frequent during the dry season, suggesting either the species' preference for dry climatic conditions or a lack of available breeding sites during the rainy season due to the seasonal flooding in this area. Targeting interventions to kill mosquitoes in swarms or to achieve an over-flooding ratio of sterile males during the rainy season would increase their efficiency in reducing the population density of this vector.",2018,PLoS ONE
Model Calibration Through Minimal Adjustments,"The Gaussian process (GP) model provides a powerful methodology for calibrating a computer model in the presence of model uncertainties. However, if the data contain systematic experimental errors, then the GP model can lead to an unnecessarily complex adjustment of the computer model. In this work, we introduce an adjustment procedure that brings the computer model closer to the data by making minimal changes to it. This is achieved by applying a lasso-based variable selection on the systematic experimental error terms while fitting the GP model. Two real examples and simulations are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. This article has supplementary material available online.",2014,Technometrics
Graphical Nonconvex Optimization via an Adaptive Convex Relaxation,"We consider the problem of learning highdimensional Gaussian graphical models. The graphical lasso is one of the most popular methods for estimating Gaussian graphical models. However, it does not achieve the oracle rate of convergence. In this paper, we propose the graphical nonconvex optimization for optimal estimation in Gaussian graphical models, which is then approximated by a sequence of adaptive convex programs. Our proposal is computationally tractable and produces an estimator that achieves the oracle rate of convergence. The statistical error introduced by the sequential approximation is clearly demonstrated via a contraction property. The proposed methodology is then extended to modeling semiparametric graphical models. We show via numerical studies that the proposed estimator outperforms other popular methods for estimating Gaussian graphical models.",2018,
Pre-Selection in Cluster Lasso Methods for Correlated Variable Selection in High-Dimensional Linear Models,"We consider variable selection problems in high dimensional sparse regression models with strongly correlated variables. To handle correlated variables, the concept of clustering or grouping variables and then pursuing model fitting is widely accepted. When the dimension is very high, finding an appropriate group structure is as difficult as the original problem. We propose to use Elastic-net as a pre-selection step for Cluster Lasso methods (i.e. Cluster Group Lasso and Cluster Representative Lasso). The Elastic-net selects correlated relevant variables, but it fails to reveal the correlation structure among the active variables. We use cluster Lasso methods to address shortcoming of the Elastic-net, and the Elasticnet is used to provide reduced feature set for the cluster Lasso methods. We theoretically explore, the group selection consistency of the proposed combination of algorithms under various conditions, i.e. Irrepresentable Condition (IC), Elastic-net Irrepresentable Condition (EIC) and Group Irrepresentable Condition (GIC). We support the theory using simulated and real dataset examples.",2017,
Predictive State Smoothing (PRESS): Scalable non-parametric regression for high-dimensional data with variable selection,"We introduce predictive state smoothing (PRESS), a novel semi-parametric regression technique for high-dimensional data using predictive state representations. PRESS is a fully probabilistic model for the optimal kernel smoothing matrix. We present efficient algorithms for the joint estimation of the state space as well as the non-linear mapping of observations to predictive states and as an alternative algorithms to minimize leave-one-out cross validation error. The proposed estimator is straightforward to implement using (stochastic) gradient descent and scales well for large N and large p. LASSO penalty parameters as well the optimal smoothness can be estimated as part of the optimization. Finally we show that out-of-sample predictions are on par with or better than alternative state-of-the-art regression methods on the abalone and MNIST benchmark datasets. Yet unlike alternative methods PRESS gives meaningful domainspecific insights and can be used for statistical inference via regression coefficients.",2017,

SPLS, Principle Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) are presented to construct prediction model. The result advocated that SPLS can select grouped wavelengths and improve the prediction performance. The absorption peaks of the Moisture is covered in the selected wavelengths, well other compositions have not been confirmed yet. In a word, SPLS can reduce the dimensionality of complex data sets and interpret the relationship between spectroscopic data and composition concentration, which will play an increasingly important role in the field of NIR application.",2015,Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu

It is often described as a process that strives to produce desirable changes in the behavior of individual. The modern education is concerned with the development of an individual through at integrated to fit in the society, which maintain advances social order. Games and sports have been part of human life almost since the time immemorial. Be it a necessity for his survival i.e. hunting for food and shelter, safety from wild animals or other enemies or as a pursuit of pleasure, the games and sports have been indispensable to man kind and have been part of his culture. Through the origin of sports is lost in antiquity, it is quite certain that physical activity have been a basic necessity of life, more that fun and diversion, for his survival depended on it. Gradually along with the process of evolution, such activities become more plays become part of culture of tribes. People used sports and games as a means of transmitting the cultural heritage of their tribes, games, sports and physical activities, persisted despite the rise and fall of ancient civilization as a cultural heritage to another. Today games and sports have emerged as universal culture phenomena. (Ajmer Singh, Jagtar, Jagdish Bains, 2000). Training in sports and games is no longer a myth and it has no casual approach, but it provides opportunities for scientific process and verification. Training has been accepted as a highly specialized science. Physical education scientist are striving to understand the various factor affecting skeletal and muscular activity, during variation of human movements with the help of electro - myography and are engaged in analyzing the biomechanics of performances of the top athletes by focusing their attention upon the analysis of sports skills. They are consistently studying factors like strength, limb length, mass, inertia proportions and angular and linear velocity that influence these movements, to get a better insight into the complexities of human motion and performance. The latest approach is aimed at the construction of a mathematical model of a skill in a form which is suitable for computer analysis so that is could be simulated under several carefully controlled conditions for predicting more effective techniques for higher performances. (Doris I Miller and Richard C. Nelson, 1973). In long jumping (formerly called broad jumping), the contestant dashes along a runway and springs into the air from a take off board, with the aim of covering the greatest possible distance. While still in the air the jumper throws both feet for forward of the body. Competitors take three jumps for distance, after which the best performers get three more jumps. A jump is measured along a straight line extending from the front edge of the take off board to the mark made closest to the take off board by any part of the4 jumper""s body as the jumper lands in the send pit. The athletes are rated on their longest jump. Long jumping requires strong leg and abdominal muscles, running speed, and leg spring. (Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 1993-2001). Simple as well as specialized form of hoping and leaping and hurdling are clustered in a general category of skills called jumps. A jump is accomplished by propelling the body off the ground with the thrust from one or both the legs. The method of launching the body into the air is the essential ingredient of the jump, but in many instances the method of landing is important to skillful performance. Jumping however ordinarily is associated with more vigorous and extensive non-support movement and should be regarded as more difficult skill. (Ralph L. Widestron. 1977). As the foot is raised from the floor no action occurs in the ankle joint except for the slight flexion. In first third of the time between heels raising and the final thrust the ankle is flexed 5 degree. Since ankle flexion carry the C.G. of the body forward and thereby increase the effect of gravitational pull, the difference in the metarsophalangeal action is expected. Beyond this rate until the final thrust. (John M. Cooper and Ruth Balassow, 1969).",2014,IOSR Journal of Sports and Physical Education
A network perspective on comorbid depression in adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"People with obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD] frequently suffer from depression, a comorbidity associated with greater symptom severity and suicide risk. We examined the associations between OCD and depression symptoms in 87 adolescents with primary OCD. We computed an association network, a graphical LASSO, and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model symptom interactions. Models showed OCD and depression as separate syndromes linked by bridge symptoms. Bridges between the two disorders emerged between obsessional problems in the OCD syndrome, and guilt, concentration problems, and sadness in the depression syndrome. A directed network indicated that OCD symptoms directionally precede depression symptoms. Concentration impairment emerged as a highly central node that may be distinctive to adolescents. We conclude that the network approach to mental disorders provides a new way to understand the etiology and maintenance of comorbid OCD-depression. Network analysis can improve research and treatment of mental disorder comorbidities by generating hypotheses concerning potential causal symptom structures and by identifying symptoms that may bridge disorders.",2018,Journal of anxiety disorders
Falling Behind or Catching up-Structural Break Story of Africaâ€™s Convergence,In this empirical paper we show that the â€œiron-lawâ€ of convergence (2%) stills holds for the world. We detect a break in Africaâ€™s convergence rate and argue that Africa was not really converging before 2000. The world convergence rate before 2000 was mostly driven by Asian and Latin American countries. We show that the recent institutional and infrastructural development has led the African countries on the path of â€œcatching upâ€. We use LASSO to select the variables and use the double selection method to estimate the treatment effect in the partially linear model. We also compare LASSO variable selections with GBM and Random Forest variable selections.,2014,
Coupling of Energy Intensity and Optimal Economic Growthâ€”â€”Based on Factors of Production Alternative,"This paper sets up the optimal economic growth model based on production factors alternative perspective and optimization theory. Result of Lasso analysis showed that,there is a strong coupling between economic growth and energy consumption,energy consumption for each one percentage point increase,national production GDP will increase by 0.034 percentage points; Chinese energy intensity from 2014 to 2020 is between 0.8-0.7,optimal economic growth of is about 8%. The coupling relationship between economic growth and energy intensity shows that,in the long run,one-sided reduce energy consumption,excessively emphasis on reducing energy intensity,will possibly lead to damping effect on economic development. Generally speaking,the elasticity of substitution and capital productivity has a positive effect on economic growth;promoting energy prices will be bad economic growth. How to give full play to the factors of production alternatives in ensuring optimum between economic growth and reduce energy intensity is directed to find a balance future economic development.",2015,Soft science
"Relationships among predatory fish, sea urchins and barrens in Mediterranean rocky reefs across a latitudinal gradient.","Previous studies conducted on a local scale emphasised the potential of trophic cascades in Mediterranean rocky reefs (involving predatory fish, sea urchins and macroalgae) in affecting the transition between benthic communities dominated by erected macroalgae and barrens (i.e., bare rock with partial cover of encrusting algae). Distribution patterns of fish predators of sea urchins (Diplodus sargus sargus, Diplodus vulgaris, Coris julis and Thalassoma pavo), sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula) and barrens, and fish predation rates upon sea urchins, were assessed in shallow (3-6m depth) sublittoral rocky reefs in the northern, central and southern sectors of the eastern Adriatic Sea, i.e., on a large spatial scale of hundreds of kilometres. No dramatic differences were observed in predatory fish density across latitude, except for a lower density of small D. sargus sargus in the northern Adriatic and an increasing density of T. pavo from north to south. P. lividus did not show any significant difference across latitude, whereas A. lixula was more abundant in the southern than in the central Adriatic. Barrens were more extended in the southern than in the central and northern sectors, and were related with sea urchin density. Fish predation upon adult sea urchins did not change on a large scale, whereas it was slightly higher in the southern sector for juveniles when predation rates of both urchins were pooled. Results show that: (1) assemblages of predatory fish and sea urchins, and barren extent change across latitude in the eastern Adriatic Sea, (2) the weak relations between predatory fish density and predation rates on urchins reveal that factors other than top-down control can be important over large scale (with the caveat that the study was conducted in fished areas) and (3) patterns of interaction among strongly interacting taxa could change on large spatial scales and the number of species involved.",2007,Marine environmental research
A socio-geographical approach to the diversity of urban agriculture in a West African city,"Abstract There is a substantial body of literature addressing urban agriculture (UA) and its diversity. But the reasons for this diversity and the perseverance of UA in todayâ€™s cities are complex, and few studies have been conducted on a regional scale that focuses on the UA dynamics involved. We took this approach in a multi-scale and space-time analysis of UA in the African city of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). In order to identify determinants of the transformations in agriculture within the city and its urban fringe we analyzed interactions from two main perspectives: (i) between urban and agricultural dynamics in both the city and on a regional scale, and (ii) between land status and actor strategies at the intra-urban scale. The analysis is centered on three areas of urban fringe that have been subjected to various land use changes over time and illustrate the different ways that farmers have adapted to urbanization. On a regional scale, results show how agricultural and regional market dynamics foment UA development by providing commercial outlets and producing agricultural inputs. At the local (city) scale, results show how and why different forms of UA have emerged in specific locations that reflect the socio-economic profile of farmers (ranging from autochthonous urban farmers to relatively wealthy urban dwellers), their access to resources, the possibility of intensifying farming activities, and the formal or informal land negotiations and transactions between the various categories of actors. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical implications of this research and its relevance to public policy. Our analysis underlines the pertinence of comprehensive and qualitative approaches for analyzing the complexity of UA dynamics and enhancing the position of agriculture in land planning for geographically-specific urban contexts.",2018,Landscape and Urban Planning
The Application of Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers on 1 l -norms Problems,"l 1 regularization is commonly used for variable or model selection, and it is often incorporated into the penalized likelihood framework for the sparse solutions. Lasso, group lasso and graphical lasso are three representative methods among them. The objective functions of these methods all contain a l l penalized term. Several algorithms have been developed to solve those problems, such as least angle regression for lasso, group nonnegative garrote for group lasso and block coordinate descent for graphical lasso. However, they are designed for the solution of a specific problem and none of them can solve l 1 -norm problems generally. A convex optimization algorithm called ADMM(Alternating Direction method of multipliers)splits targets problems into two distinct parts and handles them separately, which makes it a natural fit for l 1 -norm problems consisting of a likelihood term and a penalty term. Based on the methodology of ADMM, we derived a framework for the solution of lasso, group lasso and graphical lasso. The proposed framework outperforms the existing methods in simulations. Finally, we apply our method to analyze a birth weight dataset birthwt which could be found in R package MASS.",2019,
Resampling procedures to identify important SNPs using a consensus approach,"Our goal is to identify common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (minor allele frequency > 1%) that add predictive accuracy above that gained by knowledge of easily measured clinical variables. We take an algorithmic approach to predict each phenotypic variable using a combination of phenotypic and genotypic predictors. We perform our procedure on the first simulated replicate and then validate against the others. Our procedure performs well when predicting Q1 but is less successful for the other outcomes. We use resampling procedures where possible to guard against false positives and to improve generalizability. The approach is based on finding a consensus regarding important SNPs by applying random forests and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) on multiple subsamples. Random forests are used first to discard unimportant predictors, narrowing our focus to roughly 100 important SNPs. A cross-validation LASSO is then used to further select variables. We combine these procedures to guarantee that cross-validation can be used to choose a shrinkage parameter for the LASSO. If the clinical variables were unavailable, this prefiltering step would be essential. We perform the SNP-based analyses simultaneously rather than one at a time to estimate SNP effects in the presence of other causal variants. We analyzed the first simulated replicate of Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 without knowledge of the true model. Post-conference knowledge of the simulation parameters allowed us to investigate the limitations of our approach. We found that many of the false positives we identified were substantially correlated with genuine causal SNPs.",2011,BMC Proceedings
OP XII â€“ 1 Assessing the cumulative health effect following short term exposure to multiple pollutants: an evaluation of methodological approaches using simulations and real data,"Background/aim Assessment of the cumulative effect of correlated exposures is an open methodological issue in environmental epidemiology. Previous studies applied regression models with interaction terms or dimension reduction methods. The joint effect of pollutants has been also evaluated using weighted exposure scores with weights based on the strength of the specific pollutant-health outcomes associations. Methods We compared three approaches addressing multipollutant exposures in epidemiological models: main effects models, the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and a weighted exposure score. We assessed the performance of the methods by simulations under various scenarios for the pollutantsâ€™ correlations. We further applied the three methods to time series data from Athens, Greece for 2007â€“2012 to investigate the combined effect of short-term exposure to six regulated pollutants on all-cause and respiratory mortality. Results The weighted exposure score provided the least biassed cumulative estimate under all correlation scenarios for both mortality outcomes. The adaptive LASSO performed well in the case of low and medium correlation between exposures while models including all exposures linearly seriously biassed the estimate of interest. In the real data application, the cumulative effect estimate on overall mortality was similar between approaches ranging from 1.12% increase in main effects models to 0.73% in the score, while the cumulative effect on respiratory mortality resulted in variable estimates, that ranged from âˆ’0.61% increase for adaptive LASSO to 2.77% for the score approach, with overlapping confidence intervals. Conclusion The use of a weighted exposure score to address cumulative effects of correlated metrics may perform well under different exposure correlation structures and different variability in the health outcomes. Future work should assess the performance of methods under variable lag structures per pollutant or non-linear associations between pollutants and outcomes.",2018,Occupational and Environmental Medicine
Comparison of radiomics machine-learning classifiers and feature selection for differentiation of sacral chordoma and sacral giant cell tumour based on 3D computed tomography features,"ObjectiveWe aimed to identify optimal machine-learning methods for preoperative differentiation of sacral chordoma (SC) and sacral giant cell tumour (SGCT) based on 3D non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and CT-enhanced (CTE) features.MethodsA total of 95 patients were divided into a training set and a validation set. Three best feature selection methods (Relief, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Random Forest (RF)) and three classification methods, including generalised linear models (GLM), support vector machines (SVM) and RF, were compared for their performance in distinguishing SC and SGCT. The performance of the radiomics model was investigated via area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy (ACC) analysis.ResultsThe selection method LASSO + classifier GLM had the highest AUC of 0.984 and ACC of 0.897 in the validating set, followed by Relief + GLM (AUC = 0.909, ACC = 0.862) and LASSO + SVM (AUC = 0.900, ACC = 0.862) based on CTE features. For CT features, RF + GLM had the highest AUC of 0.889, while LASSO + GLM achieved a high ACC of 0.793 in the validating set. Regardless of the methods, CTE features significantly outperformed those from CT for the differentiation of SC and SGCT (ZAUC = -3.029, ZACC = -4.553; p < 0.05).ConclusionsOur study demonstrated CTE features performed better than CT features. The selection method LASSO + classifier GLM had the best performance in differentiation of SC and SGCT, which could enhance the application of radiomics methods in sacral tumours.Key Pointsâ€¢ Sacral chordoma and sacral giant cell tumour are the two most common primary tumours of the sacrum with many common clinical and imaging characteristics.â€¢ A radiomics model helps clinicians to identify the histology of a sacral tumour.â€¢ CTE features should be preferred.",2018,European Radiology

Simultaneous analysis of Lasso and Dantzig selector,"We show that, under a sparsity scenario, the Lasso estimator and the Dantzig selector exhibit similar behavior.

Some simulation results are also shown. For illustration we reanalyze two real datasets.",1999,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
Minimum Distance Estimation for Robust High-Dimensional Regression,"We propose a minimum distance estimation method for robust regression in sparse high-dimensional settings. The traditional likelihood-based estimators lack resilience against outliers, a critical issue when dealing with high-dimensional noisy data. Our method, Minimum Distance Lasso (MD-Lasso), combines minimum distance functionals, customarily used in nonparametric estimation for their robustness, with l1-regularization for high-dimensional regression. The geometry of MD-Lasso is key to its consistency and robustness. The estimator is governed by a scaling parameter that caps the influence of outliers: the loss per observation is locally convex and close to quadratic for small squared residuals, and flattens for squared residuals larger than the scaling parameter. As the parameter approaches infinity, the estimator becomes equivalent to least-squares Lasso. MD-Lasso enjoys fast convergence rates under mild conditions on the model error distribution, which hold for any of the solutions in a convexity region around the true parameter and in certain cases for every solution. Remarkably, a first-order optimization method is able to produce iterates very close to the consistent solutions, with geometric convergence and regardless of the initialization. A connection is established with re-weighted least-squares that intuitively explains MD-Lasso robustness. The merits of our method are demonstrated through simulation and eQTL data analysis.",2013,arXiv: Methodology
"Statistical Analysis of Palynological Assemblages from the Aptian-albian of the Araripe Basin, Northeast Brazil: a Case Study of Paleoenvironmental Significance of Early Cretaceous Terrestrial Palynomorphs","Statistical treatment of palynological data from Rio da Batateira and Santana formations (Aptian-Albian) of the Araripe Basin provides mathematical support to paleoclimatic interpretations. In addition to Classopollis and ephedroid pollen, widely accepted as aridity indicators, other typical xerophytic elements include Afropollis spp., Spheripollenites subgranulatus Couper, Monosulcites s.l., Brenneripollis peroreticulatus (Brenner), and bisaccate pollen. The correlation between ephedroid pollen and perisporium-bearing spores is surprising, since pteridophytic spores normally tend to be incompatible with xerophytic elements. This fact may be explained by the habitat of this pteridophytic flora which occupied humid river-side lands under general dry climatic conditions. Another unexpected correlation is that of bisaccate pollen with Classopollis and ephedroid pollen. In the Aptian-Albian of the Araripe Basin, as elsewhere in the West African-South American Microfloristic Province, bisaccates are never dominant, but occasional peaks in their relative abundance coincide with relative peaks of other arid climate palynomorphs. This fact is explained by their wind-born transportation. They may concentrate in basins situated in dry scenarios with low local palynomorph production. Interesting interpretations may be established from the correlation observed in angiospermoid pollen. While primitive monoapertura te pollen grains (Afropollis and Brenneripollis) are closely related to arid climates, tricolpate pollen grains show some divergence in their correlations. The correlation of tricolpates with both ephedroid and trilete spores is significant, but its correlation with Classopollis is weak. This may indicate the occupation of a wide range of habitats by the primitive angiosperm flora. KEY WORDS. Brazil. Araripe Basin. Cretaceous. Palynology. Statistical analysis.",2015,
Methods for detection of interactions with multiple components,"Methods for Detection of Interactions with Multiple Components Hristina Pashova Co-Chairs of the Supervisory Committee: PhD Charles Kooperberg Biostatistics PhD Michael LeBlanc Biostatistics In genetic association studies, it is typically thought that important insights will be obtained through joint modeling of genetic variants and environmental variables. However, weak effect of gene-environment interactions, and imprecise measurement of the environment make it hard to identify statistically significant interaction effects. We propose two different modeling techniques. First, for regression problems in which the main effects are already established, as is the case with many diseases or their estimation is not a priority, we propose the use of dedicated boosting. Dedicated boosting is a variation to the usual `2 boosting procedure which focuses on the interaction search in contrast to most boosting methods which address overall model prediction or classification. We compare the performance of dedicated boosting to other competing methods in the WHI data and a simulation study. Secondly, we use the idea of a structured interaction model form together with penalized regression to limit model complexity in regression problems where we believe interactions might behave in a similar way. We propose the directed LASSO, a regression modeling strategy using a pairwise fused LASSO penalty to encourage interaction model simplicity through fusion.",2013,
Computer-aided diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a radiomics method on endoscopic ultrasound image,"PurposeThe purpose of our study is to propose a preoperative computer-aided diagnosis system based on a radiomics method to differentiate gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the higher-risk group (HRG) from those of the lower-risk group (LRG) on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images.Materials and methodGastro-EUS (G-EUS) images of four different risk level GISTs were collected from 19 hospitals. The datasheet included 168 case HRG GISTs and 747 case LRG GISTs. A radiomics method with image segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification was developed. Here 439 radiomics features were firstly extracted, and then, the least absolute shrinkage selection operator (lasso) model with a tenfold cross-validation and 31 bootstraps was used to reduce the dimension of feature sets. Finally, random forest was applied to establish the classification model.ResultsThe proposed model differentiated 32 case HRG GISTs from 149 case LRG GISTs. Result for the testing set achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.839, the accuracy of 0.823, the sensitivity of 0.813 and the specificity of 0.826.ConclusionThe model could increase preoperative diagnostic accuracy and provide a valuable reference for the doctors.",2019,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery
Mode decomposition based deep learning model for multi-section traffic prediction,"Road traffic prediction plays a vital role in real-time traffic management of an intelligent transportation system (ITS). Many prediction models achieve fine results. However, most ignore the intrinsic characteristics of traffic parameter data and do not consider the spatiotemporal effects of road sections, which can reflect the situation of all road traffic. Therefore, multi-section traffic prediction is still an open problem. In this paper, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is employed to decompose the information of traffic parameters into many intrinsic mode function (IMF) components, which represent the original road traffic information in periodic and random sequences. Then, by considering the superiority of deep learning in multi-dimensional data processing, which can handle the spatiotemporal effects, a prediction model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to achieve the prediction of periodic and random sequences, whose results are combined to obtain the final prediction. The dataset from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System is used to validate the model. The proposed prediction model is compared to several well-known models, such as PCA-BP, Lasso-BP, and standard CNN. Experiments show that the proposed prediction model achieves higher accuracy.",2020,World Wide Web
"Anterior Cruciate Ligament Remnant-Preserving Reconstruction Using a ""Lasso-Loop"" Knot Configuration.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture predisposes to altered kinematics and possible knee joint degeneration. Graft fiber maturation and ligamentization may eliminate this risk during ACL reconstruction procedures. ACL remnant-sparing techniques support the theory that the preserved tissue enhances revascularization, preserves the mechanoreceptors, and leads to anatomic remodeling. The purpose of this article is to present a simple and reproducible technique of tensioning the preserved ACL remnant over the femur. A nonabsorbable suture is passed through the ACL remnant with a ""lasso-loop"" technique using a curved rotator cuff hook. Femoral and tibial tunnel preparation is performed according to a standard surgical technique for the EndoButton device (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy, Andover, MA). The free ends of the ACL remnant suture are retrieved through the tibial tunnel and passed through each outside hole of the EndoButton device. The hamstring graft is passed through the tibial and femoral tunnels and fixed to the femoral cortex by flipping the EndoButton and to the tibia by an interference screw. Finally, non-sliding half-stitch locking knots are made to secure the ACL remnant suture on the EndoButton device, by use of a knot pusher. This technique offers simple and secure tensioning of the ACL remnant on the fixation device.",2015,Arthroscopy techniques

All except the largest sole (320â€“440â€‚mm TL) also continued to feed heavily on mysids. Fish larger than 320â€‚mm had the highest number of empty stomachs during the warmer months of the year whereas those smaller than 320â€‚mm had the highest number empty during the colder months.

Graphical Nonconvex Optimization for Optimal Estimation in Gaussian Graphical Models,"We consider the problem of learning high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models. The graphical lasso is one of the most popular methods for estimating Gaussian graphical models. However, it does not achieve the oracle rate of convergence. In this paper, we propose the graphical nonconvex optimization for optimal estimation in Gaussian graphical models, which is then approximated by a sequence of convex programs. Our proposal is computationally tractable and produces an estimator that achieves the oracle rate of convergence. The statistical error introduced by the sequential approximation using the convex programs are clearly demonstrated via a contraction property. The rate of convergence can be further improved using the notion of sparsity pattern. The proposed methodology is then extended to semiparametric graphical models. We show through numerical studies that the proposed estimator outperforms other popular methods for estimating Gaussian graphical models.",2017,
"Spacial distribution patterns of Coris julis and Thalassoma pavo (Pisces, Labridae) along the south-eastern Apulian coast (SE Italy)","En Distribution patterns of two labrid fish, namely Coris julis and Thalassoma pavo, were assessed by visual census in autumn 2000 at four locations (with three sites per location), and at different depth levels (from 0 to about 30 m depth) in SE Apulia (SE Italy). Total abundance and juvenile density of T. pavo tended to be greater in shallow waters to about 10 m depth, in spite of some differences occurred at the scale of sites. Conversely, C. julis showed low densities in waters shallower than 5 m, and higher values from 5 down to about 30 m depth. In the case of C. julis, differences in the pattern related to depth occurred at both the spatial scales examined (among locations and among sites within location). The patterns observed for the two species concerned both adult and juvenile fishes, which suggests the absence of evident ontogenetic shifts in habitat use during their life history. The results presented here suggest that the two species could segregate according to depth. T. pavo, due to its well known thermophily, could thus overcompete C. julis at very shallow depths where seawaters are warmer because of the seasonal thermocline (at least during the period of the year when sampling was performed). The patterns observed in this study may also provide useful information about the scenario that could take shape in areas of the NW Mediterranean, such as the Ligurian Sea, where T. pavo started increasing in abundance in the recent years. It Le modalita di distribuzione di due specie ittiche appartenenti alla famiglia dei labridi, Coris julis e Thalassoma pavo, sono state indagate tramite visual census nellâ€™autunno 2000 presso 4 localita (con 3 siti presso ogni localita) e 4 differenti livelli batimetrici (tra 0 e circa 30 m) nella Puglia sud-orientale. Lâ€™abbondanza totale e quella dei giovanili di T. pavo e risultata maggiore nelle acque poco profonde fino a circa 10 m, malgrado una certa variabilita osservata alla scala dei siti. Per contro, C. julis ha mostrato densita minori a profondita inferiori ai 5 m e valori piu elevati tra i 5 ed i 30 m. Nel caso di C. julis, le differenze nella distribuzione in relazione alla profondita sono risultate chiare ad entrambe le scale spaziali indagate (tra localita e tra siti presso ogni localita). Le modalita osservate per le due specie hanno riguardato sia gli individui adulti sia i giovanili: cio suggerisce lâ€™assenza di evidenti â€˜shiftâ€™ ontogenetici nellâ€™uso degli habitat durante il ciclo vitale. Questi risultati suggeriscono che le due specie potrebbero segregarsi in relazione alla profondita. T. pavo, a causa della sua ben nota termofilia, potrebbe cosi risultare competitivamente superiore a C. julis a basse profondita dove le acque sono piu calde a causa del termoclino stagionale (almeno durante i periodi dellâ€™anno in cui i campionamenti sono stati eseguiti). Tali risultati possono anche fornire utili indicazioni sul possibile scenario che potrebbe verificarsi nelle aree del mediterraneo nord-occidentale, come il mar Ligure, dove T. pavo ha cominciato ad aumentare in abbondanza in anni recenti.",2004,
Variational Bayesian sparse additive matrix factorization,"Principal component analysis (PCA) approximates a data matrix with a low-rank one by imposing sparsity on its singular values. Its robust variant can cope with spiky noise by introducing an element-wise sparse term. In this paper, we extend such sparse matrix learning methods, and propose a novel framework called sparse additive matrix factorization (SAMF). SAMF systematically induces various types of sparsity by a Bayesian regularization effect, called model-induced regularization. Although group LASSO also allows us to design arbitrary types of sparsity on a matrix, SAMF, which is based on the Bayesian framework, provides inference without any requirement for manual parameter tuning. We propose an efficient iterative algorithm called the mean update (MU) for the variational Bayesian approximation to SAMF, which gives the global optimal solution for a large subset of parameters in each step. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on benchmark datasets and a foreground/background video separation problem.",2013,Machine Learning

Sparse precision matrix estimation via lasso penalized D-trace loss,"We introduce a constrained empirical loss minimization framework for estimating high-dimensional sparse precision matrices and propose a new loss function, called the D-trace loss, for that purpose. A novel sparse precision matrix estimator is defined as the minimizer of the lasso penalized D-trace loss under a positive-definiteness constraint. Under a new irrepresentability condition, the lasso penalized D-trace estimator is shown to have the sparse recovery property. Examples demonstrate that the new condition can hold in situations where the irrepresentability condition for the lasso penalized Gaussian likelihood estimator fails. We establish rates of convergence for the new estimator in the elementwise maximum, Frobenius and operator norms. We develop a very efficient algorithm based on alternating direction methods for computing the proposed estimator. Simulated and real data are used to demonstrate the computational efficiency of our algorithm and the finite-sample performance of the new estimator. The lasso penalized D-trace estimator is found to compare favourably with the lasso penalized Gaussian likelihood estimator.",2014,Biometrika
Intra- and inter-sparse multiple output regression with application on environmental microbial community study,"Feature selection is important for many biological studies, especially when the number of available samples is limited (in order of hundreds) while the number of input features is large (in order of millions), such as eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) mapping, GWAS (genome wide association study) and environmental microbial community study. We study the problem of multiple output regression which leverages the underlying common relationship shared by multiple output features and propose an efficient and accurate approach for feature selection. Our approach considers both intra- and inter-group sparsities. The intergroup sparsity assumes that only small set of input features are related to the output features. The intragroup sparsity assumes that each input features may relate to multiple output features which should have different kinds of sparsity. Most existing methods do not model the intragroup sparsity well by either assuming uniform regularization on each group, i.e. each input feature relates to similar number of output features, or requiring prior knowledge of the relationship of input and output features. By modelling the regression coefficients as a mixture distributions of Laplacian and Gaussian, we can shrink group regression coefficients to be small adaptively and learn the intergroup, intragroup sparsity and shrinkage estimation patterns. Empirical studies on the synthetic and real environmental microbial community datasets show that our model has better predictions on test dataset than existing methods such as Lasso, Elastic Net, dirty model and rMTFL (robust multi-task feature learning). Moreover, by using least angle regression or coordinate descent and projected gradient descent techniques for optimization, we can obtain the optimal regression efficiently.",2013,2013 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine
Prediction models and risk assessment for silicosis using a retrospective cohort study among workers exposed to silica in China,"This study aims to develop a prognostic risk prediction model for the development of silicosis among workers exposed to silica dust in China. The prediction model was performed by using retrospective cohort of 3,492 workers exposed to silica in an iron ore, with 33 years of follow-up. We developed a risk score system using a linear combination of the predictors weighted by the LASSO penalized Cox regression coefficients. The model's predictive accuracy was evaluated using time-dependent ROC curves. Six predictors were selected into the final prediction model (age at entry of the cohort, mean concentration of respirable silica, net years of dust exposure, smoking, illiteracy, and no. of jobs). We classified workers into three risk groups according to the quartile (Q1, Q3) of risk score; 203 (23.28%) incident silicosis cases were derived from the high risk group (risk score â‰¥ 5.91), whilst only 4 (0.46%) cases were from the low risk group (risk score < 3.97). The score system was regarded as accurate given the range of AUCs (83-96%). This study developed a unique score system with a good internal validity, which provides scientific guidance to the clinicians to identify high-risk workers, thus has important cost efficient implications.",2015,Scientific Reports
"Colonic volvulus in the United States: trends, outcomes, and predictors of mortality.","INTRODUCTION
Colonic volvulus is a rare entity associated with high mortality rates. Most studies come from areas of high endemicity and are limited by small numbers. No studies have investigated trends, outcomes, and predictors of mortality at the national level.


METHODS
The Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2002-2010 was retrospectively reviewed for colonic volvulus cases admitted emergently. Patients' demographics, hospital factors, and outcomes of the different procedures were analyzed. The LASSO algorithm for logistic regression was used to build a predictive model for mortality in cases of sigmoid (SV) and cecal volvulus (CV) taking into account preoperative and operative variables.


RESULTS
An estimated 3,351,152 cases of bowel obstruction were admitted in the United States over the study period. Colonic volvulus was found to be the cause in 63,749 cases (1.90%). The incidence of CV increased by 5.53% per year whereas the incidence of SV remained stable. SV was more common in elderly males (aged 70 years), African Americans, and patients with diabetes and neuropsychiatric disorders. In contrast, CV was more common in younger females. Nonsurgical decompression alone was used in 17% of cases. Among cases managed surgically, resective procedures were performed in 89% of cases, whereas operative detorsion with or without fixation procedures remained uncommon. Mortality rates were 9.44% for SV, 6.64% for CV, 17% for synchronous CV and SV, and 18% for transverse colon volvulus. The LASSO algorithm identified bowel gangrene and peritonitis, coagulopathy, age, the use of stoma, and chronic kidney disease as strong predictors of mortality.


CONCLUSIONS
Colonic volvulus is a rare cause of bowel obstruction in the United States and is associated with high mortality rates. CV and SV affect different populations and the incidence of CV is on the rise. The presence of bowel gangrene and coagulopathy strongly predicts mortality, suggesting that prompt diagnosis and management are essential.",2014,Annals of surgery
Can whole-tumor radiomics-based CT analysis better differentiate fat-poor angiomyolipoma from clear cell renal cell caricinoma: compared with conventional CT analysis?,"This study aimed to discriminate fat-poor angiomyolipoma (fp-AML) from clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) by constructing radiomics-based logistic classifiers in comparison with conventional computed tomography (CT) analysis at three CT phases. Twenty-two fp-AML patients and 62 ccRCC patients who were pathologically identified were enrolled in this study, and underwent three-phase (unenhanced phase, UP; corticomedullary phase, CMP; nephrographic phase, NP) CT examinations. Whole-tumor regions of interest (ROIs) were contoured in ITK software by two radiologists. Radiomic features were dimensionally reduced by means of ANOVAâ€‰+â€‰MW, correlation analysis, and LASSO. Four radiomics logistic classifiers including the UP group, CMP group, NP group, and sum group were built, and the radiomic scores (rad-scores) were calculated. After collecting the qualitative and quantitative conventional CT characteristics, the conventional CT analysis logistic classifier and the radiomics-based logistic classifier were constructed. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was constructed to evaluate the validity of each classifier. The area under curve (AUC) of the conventional CT analysis logistic classifier including angular interface, cyst degeneration, and pseudocapsule was 0.935 (95% CI 0.860â€“0.977). Regarding logistic classifiers for radiomics analysis, the AUCs of the UP group were 0.950 (95% CI 0.895â€“1.000) and 0.917 (95% CI 0.801â€“1.000) in the training set and testing set, respectively, which were higher than those of the CMP and NP groups. The AUCs of the sum group were observed to be the highest. The top three selected features for the UP and sum groups belonged to GLCM parameters and histogram parameters. The radiomics-based logistic classifier encompassed cyst degeneration, pseudocapsule, and sum rad-score, and the AUC of the model was 0.988 (95% CI 0.935â€“1.000). Whole-tumor radiomics-based CT analysis is superior to conventional CT analysis in the differentiation of fp-AML from ccRCC. Cyst degeneration, pseudocapsule, and sum rad-score are the most significant factors. The radiomics analysis of the UP group shows a higher AUC than that of the CMP and NP groups.",2020,Abdominal Radiology
Modeling Characteristics of Real Loudspeakers Using Various Acoustic Models: Modal-domain Approaches,"The accuracy and perception of soundfields produced by loudspeaker arrays are strongly influenced by the inherent characteristics of the commercial loudspeakers. This paper analyzes such characteristics of loudspeakers by deriving equivalent theoretical models, and by studying their impact on soundfield reproduction. A number of acoustic models are investigated, including plane waves decomposition, point source decomposition and mixed source decomposition. Each proposed model employs three effective sparse decomposition algorithms for optimized solutions, including iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), matching pursuit (MP) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). A successful model shall enable the prediction of the soundfield outside the original recording region. Therefore, we validate the effectiveness of the models by comparing the simulated soundfield with secondary measurements obtained beyond the original area. Experimental results have confirmed that both the plane wave and mixed source model achieve promising performance with respect to the proposed metrics.",2019,"ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"

Variational analysis perspective on linear convergence of some first order methods for nonsmooth convex optimization problems,"We understand linear convergence of some first-order methods such as the proximal gradient method (PGM), the proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and the randomized block coordinate proximal gradient method (R-BCPGM) for minimizing the sum of a smooth convex function and a nonsmooth convex function from a variational analysis perspective. We introduce a new analytic framework based on some theories on variational analysis such as the error bound/calmness/metric subregularity/bounded metric subregularity. This variational analysis perspective enables us to provide some concrete sufficient conditions for checking linear convergence and applicable approaches for calculating linear convergence rates of these first-order methods for a class of structured convex problems where the smooth part of the objective function is a composite of a smooth strongly convex function and a linear function. In particular, we show that these conditions are satisfied automatically, and the modulus for the calmness/metric subregularity is practically computable in some important applications such as in the LASSO, the fused LASSO and the group LASSO.

"Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and statins: no effect on ablation outcome after ablation of atrial fibrillation.","BACKGROUND
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and inflammation are supposed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). This retrospective clinical study was intended to assess the influence of drugs with antiinflammatory and/or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-modulating properties, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and statins, on AF-free survival after AF ablation.


METHODS
The study included 234 patients (23-80 years; 71.8% men) with drug-resistant paroxysmal (n = 165) or persistent AF (n = 69) who either underwent a Lasso-guided segmental pulmonary vein isolation (n = 83) or a CARTO-guided left atrial circumferential ablation (n = 151). Treatment with statins (n = 113), ACE-Is, or ARBs (n = 124), or a combination of a statin and an ACE-I or ARB (n = 75) was started >3 months before ablation and was continued during follow-up.


RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 12.7 months, 64% of patients with paroxysmal and 45% of patients with persistent AF were free of AF. Statin use (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; P = .79), ACE-I or ARB use (HR, 1.12; P = .59), and their combined use (statin + ACE-I/ARB; HR, 1.17; P = .54) did not significantly influence ablation outcome as assessed by Cox regression analysis. In addition, after multivariate adjustment for potential confounders, the examined drugs did not significantly affect ablation outcome. Ablation induced an acute up-regulation of C-reactive protein levels (preablation vs 48 hours postablation, 5.9 +/- 8.1 vs 33.7 +/- 30 mg/L; P < .001) and other inflammatory markers. The examined drugs did not significantly alter baseline levels or ablation-induced up-regulation of inflammatory markers.


CONCLUSIONS
The routine use of statins, ACE-Is, or ARBs did not result in an improved outcome of AF ablation.",2007,American heart journal

Feature Selection for Support Vector Machine in the Study of Financial Early Warning System,"In this article, we introduce the L1 regularized support vector machine (L1-SVM) as an effective feature selection technique into the modeling of financial early warning system (EWS), for the purpose of establishing compact financial EWSs for Chinese-listed companies. By introducing LASSO penalty into the SVM framework, the L1-SVM is a capable methodology to select causative features in classification problem. We evaluate the feature selection performance of L1-SVM under different circumstances through numerical simulations and find it suitable for selecting features for financial EWS. In the real study, we establish four financial EWSs with features selected by L1-SVM and compare them with those trained with full features. The empirical result illustrates that our EWSs, with only minority of features, outperform significantly than full ones in the respect of generalization performance, which indicates the feasibility of L1-SVM in real applications.

Button-cell for hearing aid apparatus based on gasatomized powders of hydriding alloy La-Ni-Co-Al,"Gas atomized powders of LaNi2,5Co2,4Al0,1 alloywere prepared and used for the construction of nickel/metal hydride battery. The powdercharacteristics such as particle size distribution, morphology, oxygen content, crystal structure fordifferent fractions were analyzed. The hydriding and electrochemical properties were evaluatedtoo. All fractions have a similar particle morphology and only a slightly different X-ray determinedlattice parameters of the alloy. The fractions with particle size less than 50 Î¼m have apoor activity at both gaseous and electrochemical hydriding. This phenomenon may be attributedto the presence of fine fractions of the amorphous component.

Weather index insurance design: a novel approach for crop insurance in Brazil,"Weather index insurance design: a novel approach for crop insurance in Brazil Crop insurance is recognized as one of the most efficient mechanisms of income protection in agriculture, transferring risk from agriculture to other agents and economic sectors. Insurance tends to stimulate the increase of cultivated area and the use of technology, especially as it acts as an additional guarantee for access to credit. In Brazil, however, the massification of rural insurance is limited due to the restricted budget to fund government subsidization. Also, the lack of predictability and guarantee of resources prevents the long-term planning of investments by the private sector, imposes costs on the beneficiaries and generates dissatisfaction of the target public. This thesis aims to contribute to the expansion of crop insurance in Brazil through the research of index insurance, which has lower administrative and claim adjustment costs when compared to traditional insurance. The absence of in situ claim adjustment and moral hazard monitoring reduces the administrative costs of this type of insurance, permitting a subsidy free crop insurance. In the first of two articles, we explore the availability and quality of public databases for soybean yields and daily rainfall in the state of ParanÃ¡ in Brazil in order to verify the feasibility of an index insurance product. We use multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) to fill missing values in the rainfall dataset and study the existence of spatial and temporal patterns in the data by means of hierarchical clustering. Our results indicate that ParanÃ¡ fulfills data requirements for a scalable weather index insurance with MICE and hierarchical clustering being effective tools in the pre-processing of data. The second article studies the efficiency of a novel regression approach, the geographically weighted quantile LASSO (GWQLASSO) in the modelling of yield-index relationship for weather index insurance products. GWQLASSO allows regression coefficients to vary spatially, while using the information from neighboring locations to derive robust estimates. The LASSO component of the model facilitates the selection of relevant explanatory variables. A weather index insurance (WII) product is developed based on 1-month SPI derived from a daily precipitation dataset for 41 weather stations in the State of ParanÃ¡ (Brazil) for the period of 1979 through 2015. Soybean yield data are also used for the 41 municipalities from 1980 through 2015. The effectiveness of the GWQLASSO product is evaluated against a classic quantile regression approach and a traditional yield insurance product using the Spectral Risk Measure (SRM) and the Mean Semi-deviation. While GWQLASSO proved as effective as quantile regression it outperformed the yield insurance product, thus proving an alternative to the crop insurance market in Brazil and other locations with limited data.",2019,
Discovery and Confirmation of Diagnostic Serum Lipid Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease Using Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder lacking early biochemical diagnosis and treatment. Lipids have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including AD. A shotgun lipidomic approach was undertaken to determine if lipid biomarkers exist that can discriminate AD cases from controls. The discovery study involved sera from 29Â different stage AD cases and 32 controls. Lipid extraction was performed using organic solvent and the samples were directly infused into a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Differences between AD cases and controls were detected with 87 statistically significant lipid candidate markers found. These potential lipid markers were reevaluated in a second confirmatory study involving 27 cases and 30 controls. Of the 87 candidates from the first study, 35 continued to be statistically significant in the second confirmatory set. Tandem MS studies were performed and almost all confirmed markers were characterized and classified. Using a Bayesian lasso probit regression model on the confirmed markers, a multi-marker set with AUCâ€Š=â€Š0.886 was developed comparing all stages of AD with controls. Additionally, using confirmed biomarkers, multi-marker sets with AUCsâ€Š>0.90 were developed for each specific AD Clinical Dementia Rating versus controls, including the earliest stage of AD. More conservative and likely more realistic statistical analyses still found multi-marker sets that appeared useful in diagnosing AD. Finally, using ordinal modeling a set of markers was developed that staged AD accurately 70% of the time, pâ€Š=â€Š0.0079. These results suggest that these serum lipidomic biomarkers may help diagnose and perhaps even stage AD.",2017,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD

"Application of a single-objective, hybrid genetic algorithm approach to pharmacokinetic model building","A limitation in traditional stepwise population pharmacokinetic model building is the difficulty in handling interactions between model components. To address this issue, a method was previously introduced which couples NONMEM parameter estimation and model fitness evaluation to a single-objective, hybrid genetic algorithm for global optimization of the model structure. In this study, the generalizability of this approach for pharmacokinetic model building is evaluated by comparing (1) correct and spurious covariate relationships in a simulated dataset resulting from automated stepwise covariate modeling, Lasso methods, and single-objective hybrid genetic algorithm approaches to covariate identification and (2) information criteria values, model structures, convergence, and model parameter values resulting from manual stepwise versus single-objective, hybrid genetic algorithm approaches to model building for seven compounds. Both manual stepwise and single-objective, hybrid genetic algorithm approaches to model building were applied, blinded to the results of the other approach, for selection of the compartment structure as well as inclusion and model form of inter-individual and inter-occasion variability, residual error, and covariates from a common set of model options. For the simulated dataset, stepwise covariate modeling identified three of four true covariates and two spurious covariates; Lasso identified two of four true and 0 spurious covariates; and the single-objective, hybrid genetic algorithm identified three of four true covariates and one spurious covariate. For the clinical datasets, the Akaike information criterion was a median of 22.3 points lower (range of 470.5 point decrease to 0.1 point decrease) for the best single-objective hybrid genetic-algorithm candidate model versus the final manual stepwise model: the Akaike information criterion was lower by greater than 10 points for four compounds and differed by less than 10 points for three compounds. The root mean squared error and absolute mean prediction error of the best single-objective hybrid genetic algorithm candidates were a median of 0.2 points higher (range of 38.9 point decrease to 27.3 point increase) and 0.02 points lower (range of 0.98 point decrease to 0.74 point increase), respectively, than that of the final stepwise models. In addition, the best single-objective, hybrid genetic algorithm candidate models had successful convergence and covariance steps for each compound, used the same compartment structure as the manual stepwise approach for 6 of 7 (86Â %) compounds, and identified 54Â % (7 of 13) of covariates included by the manual stepwise approach and 16 covariate relationships not included by manual stepwise models. The model parameter values between the final manual stepwise and best single-objective, hybrid genetic algorithm models differed by a median of 26.7Â % (q1Â =Â 4.9Â % and q3Â =Â 57.1Â %). Finally, the single-objective, hybrid genetic algorithm approach was able to identify models capable of estimating absorption rate parameters for four compounds that the manual stepwise approach did not identify. The single-objective, hybrid genetic algorithm represents a general pharmacokinetic model building methodology whose ability to rapidly search the feasible solution space leads to nearly equivalent or superior model fits to pharmacokinetic data.",2012,Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics

Deep Learning-Based Quantitative Computed Tomography Model in Predicting the Severity of COVID-19: A Retrospective Study in 196 Patients,"Background: The assessment of the severity of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by clinical presentations cannot met the urgently clinical need so far. We aimed to establish a model of deep learning (DL)-based quantitative computed tomography (CT) and initial clinical features in prediction of the severity of COVID-19. 
 
Methods: One hundred and ninety-six hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from Jan 20 to Feb 10, 2020 in our center, and were divided into the severe and non-severe group. The clinico-radiological data at admission were compared between the two groups. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model for predicting the severity of COVID-19 was established, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) values of the model, quantitative CT parameters significantly different in univariate analysis, and pneumonia severity index (PSI) were compared. 
 
Findings: In comparison with non-severe group (151 cases), severe patients (45 cases) had higher PSI (p<0.001). DL-based quantitative CT indicated that the mass of infection (MOICT) and the percentage of infection (POICT) in the severe group was higher (p<0.001).The LASSO logistic regression model was based on MOICT together with clinical features including age, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), CD4+ T cell counts. The AUC value for the model was 0.890, and was significantly higher than that for MOICT, POICT, or PSI score (all p<0.01). 
 
Interpretation: The DL-based quantitative CT model has more efficiency in predicting the severity of COVID-19 than quantitative CT parameters and PSI score do.

Forward Regression for Ultra-High Dimensional Variable Screening,"Motivated by the seminal theory of Sure Independence Screening (Fan and Lv 2008, SIS), we investigate here another popular and classical variable screening method, namely, forward regression (FR). Our theoretical analysis reveals that FR can identify all relevant predictors consistently, even if the predictor dimension is substantially larger than the sample size. In particular, if the dimension of the true model is finite, FR can discover all relevant predictors within a finite number of steps. To practically select the â€œbestâ€ candidate from the models generated by FR, the recently proposed BIC criterion of Chen and Chen (2008) can be used. The resulting model can then serve as an excellent starting point, from where many existing variable selection methods (e.g., SCAD and Adaptive LASSO) can be applied directly. FRâ€™s outstanding finite sample performances are confirmed by extensive numerical studies.",2009,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Collective Support Recovery for Multi-Design Multi-Response Linear Regression,"The multi-design multi-response linear regression problem is investigated, in which design matrices are Gaussian with covariance matrices Î£<sup>(1:K)</sup> = (Î£<sup>(1)</sup>, ... , 1<sup>(K)</sup>) for K linear regression tasks. Design matrices across tasks are assumed to be independent. The support union of K p-dimensional regression vectors (collected as columns of matrix B*) is recovered using l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>2</sub>-regularized lasso. Sufficient and necessary conditions on sample complexity are characterized as a sharp threshold to guarantee successful recovery of the support union. This model has been previously studied via l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>âˆž</sub>-regularized lassoand via l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>1</sub> + l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>âˆž</sub>-regularized lasso, in which sharp threshold on sample complexity is characterized only for K = 2 and under special conditions. In this paper, using l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>2</sub>-regularized lasso, sharp threshold on sample complexity is characterized under standard regularization conditions. Namely, if n > c<sub>p1</sub>Ïˆ(B*, Î£<sup>(1:K)</sup>) log(p - s) where c<sub>p1</sub> is a constant, and s is the size of the support set, then l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>2</sub>-regularized lasso correctly recovers the support union; and if n <; c<sub>p2</sub>Ïˆ(B*, Î£<sup>(1:K)</sup>)log(p - s) where c<sub>p2</sub> is a constant, then l<sub>1</sub>/l<sub>2</sub>-regularized lasso fails to recover the support union. In particular, the function Ïˆ(B*, Î£<sup>(1:K)</sup>) captures the impact of the sparsity of K regression vectors and the statistical properties of the design matrices on the threshold on sample complexity. Therefore, such threshold function also demonstrates the advantages of joint support union recovery using multitask lasso over individual support recovery using single-task lasso.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
Ultraviolet sunscreens in reef fish mucus,"Coral reef fishes were recently discovered to have ultraviolet (UV) radiation screening compounds, most commonly known as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), in their external body mucus. However, little is known about the identity and quantity of MAAs in the mucus of reef fishes or what factors affect their abundance and distribution. Using spectrophotometry, we examined the relative field UV absorbance of fresh mucus and quantified the UV absorbance per mg of mucus using laboratory UV absorbance for 7 species of reef fishes (Labroides dimidiatus and Thalassoma lunare [Labridae]; Chlorurus sordidus, Scarus flavipectoralis, S. niger, S. rivulatus, and S. schlegelii [Scaridae]) from Queensland, Australia. For the first time in fish mucus, we identified and quantified MAAs using High Performance Liquid Chromatography. In addition, to examine geographical variation in MAAs, MAA absorbance in T lunare mucus was compared among 3 different locations (Lizard Island, Heron Island, and North Stradbroke Island) on the coast of Queensland. The mucus of all fish investigated contained MAAs. Depending on the species, different combinations and quantities of the MAAs asterina-330, palythene and mycosporine-N-methylamine serine were present. UV absorbance and MAA levels in mucus of T lunare from North Stradbroke Island were lower (mycosporine-N-methylamine serine) or absent (palythene) compared with mucus from Lizard Island and Heron Island. This study shows that the identity and quantity of MAAs in fish mucus not only varies among species but also within a species sampled in different locations. This suggests that the ecological role of MAAs in fishes is varied and complex and that several factors may affect the type and quantity of MAAs found in the mucus of reef fishes.",2008,Marine Ecology Progress Series
A reinvestigation of the Rydberg states of H2S and D2S by two-photon resonant multiphoton ionisation spectroscopy,"The technique of 2 + 1 resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionisation spectroscopy has been applied to the molecules H2S and D2S. Spectroscopic analysis provides the first definitive experimental evidence for the three series associated with electron excitation from the 2b1 highest occupied molecular orbital to the p Rydberg functions, and for at least one nf Ã¢â€ ï¿½ 2b1 series. The results point to flaws in all previous analyses of the H2S vertical electronic spectrum which, when corrected, allow an overall interpretation of the Rydberg states that is in excellent accord with the results of the most recent ab initio calculations of Galasso (J. Phys. B, 1989, 22, 2241). Additional features, evident in absorption and in MPI spectra recorded at higher light intensities, are ascribed to vibronic structure, the detailed interpretation of which must await a better knowledge of the lowest-lying (substantially valence) states derived as a result of electron promotion from the 2b1 and 5a1 molecular orbitals.",1990,"Journal of the Chemical Society, Faraday Transactions"

The study found that changes in heart functioning as a response to equal physical factors depended on the initial vegetative system tone. Patients with normotonic and sympathicotonic heart regulation displayed the activation of parasympathetic vegetative nervous system as a result of a single exposure to a complex of physical factors, whereas in vagotonic patients sympathetic heart regulation was activated under the same conditions.",2007,Vestnik Rossiiskoi akademii meditsinskikh nauk
Additional File 1 Additional figures and tables for CIDANE : Comprehensive isoform discovery and abundance estimation,"Versions and parameters of compared tools and CIDANE In our benchmarks we used Cufflinks (version 2.2.1), IsoLasso (version 2.6.1), CLASS (version 2.0.0), iReckon (version 1.0.8), StringTie (version 1.0.4), SLIDE (latest version, last update May 7th, 2012), MITIE (GitHub version from July 9th, 2014), and GRIT (latest version 1.1.2c). We used the default parameters for each tool except for the following settings: In the benchmark with incomplete annotation Cufflinks was used with option -g to provide the annotation and with --no-effective-length-correction, since the ground truth FPKM values were computed without effective length correction. IsoLasso was provided with the mean and standard deviation estimated for the fragment length distribution by Cufflinks (option -p) and, for the simulation experiment, with all exon boundaries (-e). StringTie was run with default parameters and the partial annotation was provided using the -G option. For SLIDE we set the parameters of fragment length distribution estimated by Cufflinks directly in the source code as SLIDE cannot read them from command line. Running MITIE involves three programs (define regions, generate segment graph, and transcript prediction) that were provided with the following non-default parameters, to tune its performance: define regions (--cut-regions), generate segment graph (--few-regions, --region-filter 100) and transcript prediction (--order 2). For the partial annotation benchmark we further used option (--C-num-trans 10) for transcript prediction. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, CIDANE was run with default parameters. A lower sequencing depth allows (computationally) for a finer approximation of the quadratic objective (see Additional file 1, Section 4). We thus enforce a smaller error bound Î¼ in the two simulated datasets comprising 40 million read pairs using -u 0.0001. CIDANEâ€™s initial prediction computed in Phase-I fit the simulated data better than can be observed in real data sets (sequencing errors, sequence specific and positional fragment biases). We thus take account of the larger adjusted R2 scores returned by CIDANE in Phase I and decrease the regularization penalties applied in Phase II in all simulated benchmarks by 10% (-rl 0.9).",2016,
Gravitational instability and collapse of charged fluid shells,"SummaryA solution of Einsteinâ€™s field equations is derived, representing a thin spherical shell of charged fluid, falling in a spherically symmetric field due to mass and charge at its centre. No restrictions are placed on the equation of state. By integrating the equations of motion, the law of conservation of total energy is obtained, and used to study the equilibrium states of the system, and their stability against collapse. It is found, under reasonable assumptions, that for a given equation of state and a given entropy, there is a maximum equilibrium mass, and that instability sets in at a critical radius which is always larger (very much larger, for a shell of highly relativistic fluid) than the upper NordstrÃ¶m gravitational radius. For uncharged bodies, these results completely parallel, and serve as a simple illustration of, the results of the much more complicated analyses needed for fluid balls.RiassuntoSi ricava una soluzione delle equazioni di campo di Einstein, rappresentante un sottile guscio sferico di fluido carico, in un campo e simmetria sferica dovuto alla massa ed alla carica nel suo centro. Non si pone alcuna restrizione sullâ€™equazione di stato. Integrando le equazioni di moto, si ottiene la legge di conservazione dellâ€™energia totale, e la si usa per studiare gli stati di equilibrio del sistema, e la loro stabilitÃ  al collasso. Si trova con ipotesi ragionevoli, che, data lâ€™entropia ed una data equazione di stato, vi Ã¨ una massa di massimo equilibrio, e che lâ€™instabilitÃ  si riscontra ad un raggio critico che Ã¨ sempre piÃ¹ grande (grandissimo per un guscio di fluido altamente relativistico) del raggio gravitazionale superiore di NordstrÃ¶m. Per corpi senza cariche, questi risultati sono del tutto paralleli, e ne sono una semplice illustrazione, dei risultati delle analisi molto piÃ¹ complicate necessarie per palle fluide.Ð ÐµÑÑŽÐ¼ÐµÐ’Ñ‹Ð²Ð¾Ð´Ð¸Ñ‚ÑÑ Ñ€ÐµÑ‰ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ Ð¿Ð¾Ð»ÐµÐ²Ñ‹Ñ… ÑƒÑ€Ð°Ð²Ð½ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð¹ Ð­Ð¹Ð½Ñ‰Ñ‚ÐµÐ¹Ð½Ð°, Ð¿Ñ€ÐµÐ´ÑÑ‚Ð°Ð²Ð»ÑŽÑˆÐµÐµ Ñ‚Ð¾Ð½ÐºÑƒÑŽ ÑÑ„ÐµÑ€Ð¸Ñ‡ÐµÑÐºÑƒÑŽ Ð¾Ð±Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ñ‡ÐºÑƒ ÑÐ°Ñ€ÑÐ¶ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¶Ð¸Ð´ÐºÐ¾ÑÑ‚Ð¸, ÑÐ¶Ð¸Ð¼Ð°ÑŽÑˆÐµÐ¹ÑÑ Ð² ÑÑ„ÐµÑ€Ð¸Ñ‡ÐµÑÐºÐ¸ ÑÐ¸Ð¼Ð¼ÐµÑ‚Ñ€Ð¸Ñ‡Ð½Ð¾Ð¼ Ð¿Ð¾Ð»Ðµ, Ð¾Ð±ÑƒÑÐ»Ð¾Ð²Ð»ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð¼ Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÐ¾Ð¹ Ð¸ ÑÐ°Ñ€ÑÐ´Ð¾Ð¼ Ð² ÐµÐµ Ñ†ÐµÐ½Ñ‚Ñ€Ðµ.

The distribution of the simulium damnosum complex in West Africa with particular reference to the onchocerciasis control programme area.,"A chromosomal identification of the Stimulium damnosum complex larvae collected from areas within and outside the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) area revealed six species of the complex. Five of these (S. sirbanum, S. damnosum s.s., S. soubrense, S. yahense, S. squamosum) were observed within and south of the OCP area. S. sanctipauli was found exclusively outside the OCP zone. S. sirbanum: Predominated in the Sudan Savanna, spread into the Guinea and transition zones but was almost absent in the forest region. S. damnosum s.s.: Abundant in the Guinea Savanna; was well represented in the Sudan Savanna while smaller populations penetrated the forest region. S. sanctipauli: Identified almost exclusively from the forest zone; a few savanna foci were found on the upper course of the Sassandra R. in the Ivory Coast and on the Volta R. within the coastal savanna strip in Ghana. S. soubrense: Recorded from the forest, transition and Guinea Savanna zones; northern limits were established at the LÃ©raba Bridge on the Upper Volta/Ivory Coast border. S. yahense: Predominantely distributed along creeks and small rivers in the forest region; a few records within the Guinea Savanna were found on the upper reaches of the Sassandra valley. S. squamosum: Observed in small rivers in the forest zone; extensively colonised heavily shaded or forested areas within the Guinea Savanna but in the Sudan Savanna only two records were observed near Bobo-Dioulasso in Upper Volta.",1978,Tropenmedizin und Parasitologie
"Prediction of internal egg quality characteristics and variable selection using regularization methods: ridge, LASSO and elastic net","Abstract. This study was conducted to determine the inner quality characteristics of
eggs using external egg quality characteristics. The variables were selected in
order to obtain the simplest model using ridge, LASSO and elastic net
regularization methods. For this purpose, measurements of the internal and external characteristics of 117 Japanese quail eggs
were made. Internal quality characteristics were egg yolk
weight and albumen weight; external quality characteristics were egg width,
egg length, egg weight, shape index and shell weight. An ordinary
least square method was applied to the data. Ridge, LASSO and elastic net
regularization methods were performed to remove the multicollinearity of the data.
The regression estimating equations of the internal egg
quality were significant for all methods ( P ). The goodness of fit of the regression
estimating equations for egg yolk weight was 58.34, 59.17 and 59.11â€‰%
for the ridge, LASSO and elastic net methods, respectively. For egg albumen weight the goodness of fit of the regression
estimating equations was 75.60â€‰%, 75.94â€‰% and 75.81â€‰% for the respective ridge, LASSO and elastic net
methods. It was revealed that LASSO, including two predictors
for both egg yolk weight and egg albumen weight, was the best model with
regard to high predictive accuracy.",2018,Archives Animal Breeding
"An ADME Study with 2 , 2 ' , 4 , 4 ' ,-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether ( BDE-47 ) in Chickens","Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are synthesized in large quantities and are used as flame retardants in textiles and electronic equipment, especially in computer circuit boards. Due to their structural similarity to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and biphenyls, their environmental persistence, and a growing database of toxicological effects, this class of compounds has become a new environmental contaminant. A particular group of PBDE congeners is persistent in the environment, e.g. BDE-47, 99, 100, 153 and 154 (Law et al. 2003). BDE-47 (Ã–rn and Klasson-Wehler 1998), BDE-99 (Hakk et al. 2002), BDE-100 (Hakk et al. 2006), BDE-153 (Sanders et al. 2006), BDE-154 (Hakk et al. 2005), and BDE-209 (MÃ¶rck et al. 2003), and have already been studied in rats. These studies have shown that lipophilic tissues such as adipose and skin are major depots for persistent PBDEâ€™s. Since humans commonly consume the skin of a chicken, it was of interest to conduct an adsorption, tissue disposition, metabolism and excretion study in this production species with the most persistent PBDE found in biota, i.e. 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47).",2006,
Classifications of bundle connection pairs by parallel translation and lassos,"Let M be a connected manifold and G be a closed Lie subgroup of GL(V)â€”the general linear group on a finite dimensional vector space V.

It is shown that the bundle connection pairs (E, â–½) (up to equivalence), with structure group G and fiber V, are in one to one correspondence with Mâ€”a similar result has been announced by Kobayashi. The correspondence is induced by the parallel translation operators of connections. Furthermore, if the manifold (M) is simply connected, then the space of bundle connection pairs can be classified by a collection of Lie algebra valued 1-forms on the manifold Î©m (called integrated lassos). These 1-forms are related to the differentials of elements of M. This last result generalizes Weil's characterization of U(1)â€”line bundle connection pairs by the curvature 2-form. It is also a generalization of Gross' results to base manifolds (M) other than Rn.",1989,Journal of Functional Analysis

Thresholded Lasso for high dimensional variable selection,"Given n noisy samples with p dimensions, where n "" p, we show that the multi-step thresholding procedure based on the Lasso â€“ we call it the Thresholded Lasso, can accurately estimate a sparse vector Î² âˆˆ R in a linear model Y = XÎ² + "", where XnÃ—p is a design matrix normalized to have column #2-norm âˆš n, and "" âˆ¼ N(0, ÏƒIn).

We also show for the Gauss-Dantzig selector (CandÃ¨s-Tao 07), ifX obeys a uniform uncertainty principle, one will achieve the sparse oracle inequalities as above, while allowing at most s0 irrelevant variables in the model in the worst case, where s0 â‰¤ s is the smallest integer such that for Î» = âˆš 2 log p/n, âˆ‘p i=1 min(Î² 2 i , Î» Ïƒ) â‰¤ s0Î»Ïƒ.

Oncogenes: Taking the direct route,"TP53 mutations are associated with many cancers, but are surprisingly rare in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Work from PierGiuseppe Pelicci, Saverio Minucci and colleagues now shows that an APLassociated oncoprotein provides a direct mechanism of p53 inactivation by promoting its deacetylation and subsequent degradation. Most cases of APL result from a chromosomal translocation that produces PMLâ€“RAR, a fusion of the PML and retinoic-acid receptor (RAR) proteins. This oncoprotein recruits histone deacetylases (HDACs) to chromatin to inhibit the expression of RAR target genes, predisposing cells to tumorigenesis. So, could PMLâ€“RAR also be responsible for p53 inactivation in APL? Pelicci, Minucci and colleagues showed that exposing mouse haematopoietic cells to genotoxic stress causes p53-dependent cell loss, but expression of PMLâ€“RAR protected cells from this effect. By contrast, no protection was provided by a mutant form of PMLâ€“RAR â€” known as the AHT mutant â€” that is unable to recruit HDACs. In addition, PMLâ€“RAR inhibited transcription from p53-responsive constructs in vitro, but transcription was restored using the AHT mutant. But how does PMLâ€“RAR inhibit p53 activity? Exposure of wild-type mice to genotoxic stress leads to increased p53 levels because of decreased proteasomal degradation. However, p53 levels in APL mice were shown to remain low after exposure to X-rays, indicating that PMLâ€“RAR might promote p53 degradation. Consistent with this, treatment of X-rayexposed APL animals with proteasome inhibitors led to increased p53 levels. The authors also showed that Mdm2, which targets p53 to the proteasome, is required for p53 downregulation by PMLâ€“RAR, as PMLâ€“RAR is unable to reduce p53 expression in Mdm2 â€“/â€“ cells. In addition, Arf, an Mdm2 inhibitor, restored p53 expression that was blocked by PMLâ€“RAR. Acetylation is known to stabilize p53 in response to stress by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation. So, the authors tested whether HDAC recruitment by PMLâ€“RAR leads to deacetylation of p53. When wildtype mice are exposed to X-rays, acetylated p53 accumulates. However, this effect was not seen in APL animals, even when p53 was stabilized using a proteasome inhibitor. This inhibition of p53 acetylation requires HDAC recruitment, as treatment of APL mice with an HDAC inhibitor restored both total p53 and acetylated p53 to levels similar to those seen in wild-type mice. So, PMLâ€“RAR stimulates p53 deacetylation and promotes its Mdm2-dependent proteasomal degradation. This is in contrast with the previously known function of PMLâ€“RAR in inhibiting gene expression by deacetylating chromatin. Interestingly, this newly discovered function of PMLâ€“RAR requires wild-type Pml, which binds p53 and is involved in its normal regulation. The authors showed that PMLâ€“RAR binds p53 only weakly and is unable to deacetylate p53 or protect cells from genotoxic stress in the absence of Pml. Interestingly, this is the first known example in which an oncoprotein is dependent on expression of the corresponding wild-type protein for its tumorigenic function.

Identifying and quantifying nonlinear structured relationships in complex manufactural systems,"Accurately identifying time-invariant operational relationships among different components is critical to autonomic management of complex manufactural systems. In this paper, we collect time series of sensor readings from manufacturing systems, and propose a solution leveraging Sparse Group LASSO to discover structured pairwise nonlinear relationships and quantify them by mathematical formulas. We consider both real-life operational patterns and underlying physical reactions inside the manufactural systems, which leads to a learning formulation for combined periodic and aperiodic system behaviors. An accelerated gradient descent algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the related optimization problem. We estimate sample correlations between proximal time points to improve the accuracy of the discovered relationships and the nonlinear quantitative formulas. The method is evaluated using both synthetic and real-world datasets, which shows superior performance over the state of the art in discovering nonlinear relationships in manufactural systems.",2017,2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)
A multivariate adaptive stochastic search method for dimensionality reduction in classification,"High-dimensional classification has become an increasingly important problem. In this paper we propose a ""Multivariate Adaptive Stochastic Search"" (MASS) approach which first reduces the dimension of the data space and then applies a standard classification method to the reduced space. One key advantage of MASS is that it automatically adjusts to mimic variable selection type methods, such as the Lasso, variable combination methods, such as PCA, or methods that combine these two approaches. The adaptivity of MASS allows it to perform well in situations where pure variable selection or variable combination methods fail. Another major advantage of our approach is that MASS can accurately project the data into very low-dimensional non-linear, as well as linear, spaces. MASS uses a stochastic search algorithm to select a handful of optimal projection directions from a large number of random directions in each iteration. We provide some theoretical justification for MASS and demonstrate its strengths on an extensive range of simulation studies and real world data sets by comparing it to many classical and modern classification methods.",2010,The Annals of Applied Statistics

PREAMBLE The Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) is an international scientific and professional organization founded in 1954 to promote the science, technology, and practical application of nuclear medicine. Its 18,000 members are physicians, technologists, and scientists specializing in the research and practice of nuclear medicine. In addition to publishing journals, newsletters, and books, the SNMMI also sponsors international meetings and workshops designed to increase the competencies of nuclear medicine practitioners and to promote new advances in the science of nuclear medicine. The European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) is a professional nonprofit medicalassociationthatfacilitatescommunicationworldwide between individuals pursuingclinical and researchexcellence in nuclear medicine. The EANM was founded in 1985. The SNMMI/EANM will periodically define new standards/ guidelines for nuclear medicine practice to help advance the science of nuclear medicine and to improve the quality of service to patients. Existing standards/guidelines will be reviewed for revision or renewal, as appropriate, on their fifth anniversary or sooner, if indicated. As of February 2014, the SNMMI guidelines will now be referred to as procedure standards. Any previous practice guideline or procedure guideline that describes how to perform a procedure is now considered an SNMMI procedure standard. Each standard/guideline, representing a policy statement by the SNMMI/EANM, has undergone a thorough consensus process in which it has been subjected to extensive review. The SNMMI/EANM recognizes that the safe and effective use of diagnostic nuclear medicine imaging requires specific training, skills, and techniques, as described in each document. The SNMMI and EANM have written and approved these standards/guidelines to promote the use of nuclear medicine procedures with high quality. These standards/ guidelines are intended to assist practitioners in providing appropriate nuclear medicine care for patients. They are not inflexible rules or requirements of practice and are not intended, nor should they be used, to establish a legal standard of care. For these reasons and those set forth below, the SNMMI/EANM cautions against the use of these standards/ guidelines in litigation in which the clinical decisions of a practitioner are called into question. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure or course of action must be made by medical professionals taking into account the unique circumstances of each case. Thus, there is no implication that an approach differing from the standards/guidelines, standing alone, is below the standard of care. To the contrary, a conscientious practitioner may responsibly adopt a course of action different from that set forth in the standards/ guidelines when, in the reasonable judgment of the practitioner, such course of action is indicated by the condition of the patient, limitations of available resources, or advances in knowledge or technology subsequent to publication of the standards/guidelines. The practice of medicine involves not only the science but also the art of dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation, and treatment of disease. The variety and complexity of human conditions make it impossible to always reach the most appropriate diagnosis or to predict with certainty a particular response to treatment. Therefore, it should be recognized that adherence to these standards/guidelines will not ensure",2014,Journal of nuclear medicine technology
Sepsis-associated purpura fulminans in adults.,"Sepsis-associated purpura fulminans is defined as septicemia, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation and circulatory failure leading to multiple organ dysfunction. 40-70% of patients with sepsis-associated purpura fulminans die. Early prognostic factors in adults have not been well delineated yet. Aim of our study was 1) to evaluate currently used scoring systems for meningococcal septicemia in the setting of sepsis-associated purpura fulminans and 2) to assess if other parameters are feasible as early prognostic factors. From 1.1 1994-31.12.1998 twelve patients (female: 7; mean age: 31 (21; 43) years) were studied. Six patients (50%) died within 2 hours and 7 days after admission despite standard intensive treatment. On admission non-survivors had a more pronounced degree of disseminated intravascular coagulation compared to survivors (platelet count 18000 (15000; 45000) G/l vs. 119.000 (111000; 152000) G/l, (p = 0.03); fibrinogen 67 (50; 108) mg/dl vs. 356 (234; 483) mg/dl, (p = 0.02); PTZ 28% (20%; 30%) vs. 44% (35%; 51%), (p = 0.05); aPTT 120 (120; 128) sec vs. 46 (44; 69) sec, (p = 0.001). Severity of lactic acidosis was significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors (pH 7.08 (6.92; 7.21) vs. pH 7.4 (7.25; 7.4), (p = 0.02); lactate 13.5 (11; 15) mval/l vs. 6.0 (4.4; 6) mval/l, (p = 0.02); data presented as median (25-75% interquartile range). In our patients the Glasgow Meningococcal Septicemia Prognostic Score (GMSPS) and the Niklasson-Score failed to distinguish between survivors and non-survivors (GMSPS 7 (6; 11) vs 7.5 (7; 9) out of 15; predicted mortality according to Niklasson-Score 73% vs 88%). There was no difference in the APACHE II Score (22 (18.5, 24) vs 22 (20.25, 26)). The severity of disseminated intravascular coagulation assessed by routine laboratory parameters and the degree of lactic acidosis on admission were the strongest predictors of outcome in patients with sepsis-associated purpura fulminans. Scoring systems developed for patients with meningococcal septicemia are of limited value in the setting of sepsis-associated purpura fulminans.",2001,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift
Correlates of sleep quality in midlife and beyond: a machine learning analysis.,"OBJECTIVES
In older adults, traditional metrics derived from polysomnography (PSG) are not well correlated with subjective sleep quality. Little is known about whether the association between PSG and subjective sleep quality changes with age, or whether quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) is associated with sleep quality. Therefore, we examined the relationship between subjective sleep quality and objective sleep characteristics (standard PSG and qEEG) across middle to older adulthood.


METHODS
Using cross-sectional analyses of 3173 community-dwelling men and women aged between 39 and 90 participating in the Sleep Heart Health Study, we examined the relationship between a morning rating of the prior night's sleep quality (sleep depth and restfulness) and polysomnographic, and qEEG descriptors of that single night of sleep, along with clinical and demographic measures. Multivariable models were constructed using two machine learning methods, namely lasso penalized regressions and random forests.


RESULTS
Little variance was explained across models. Greater objective sleep efficiency, reduced wake after sleep onset, and fewer sleep-to-wake stage transitions were each associated with higher sleep quality; qEEG variables contributed little explanatory power. The oldest adults reported the highest sleep quality even as objective sleep deteriorated such that they would rate their sleep better, given the same level of sleep efficiency. Despite this, there were no major differences in the predictors of subjective sleep across the age span.


CONCLUSION
Standard metrics derived from PSG, including qEEG, contribute little to explaining subjective sleep quality in middle-aged to older adults. The objective correlates of subjective sleep quality do not appear to systematically change with age despite a change in the relationship between subjective sleep quality and objective sleep efficiency.",2017,Sleep medicine
Phenomenological Metaphysics as a Speculative Realism,"ABSTRACTThe debate between speculative realism and phenomenology has become quite heated over the past years. The matter of contention is the possibility of a metaphysics that can provide knowledge of reality as it is in itself. The speculative realists accuse phenomenology of denying this possibility, confining knowledge to the sphere of subjectivity. What has been overlooked in this debate is the similarity between the speculative project of Quentin Meillassoux and a Husserlian metaphysics. This article looks at these positions from a reconciliatory point of view. After outlining the debate, conceding the problematic nature of realism for phenomenology to the speculative realists, it will be shown that there is a place for a realist metaphysics within phenomenology. After showing the similarities between Meillassouxâ€™s philosophy and a phenomenological metaphysics, and the legitimacy of qualifying the latter as a speculative realism, the conclusion will reflect on the modal notions at play in them.",2017,Journal of The British Society for Phenomenology
Prediction of the result in race walking using regularized regression models,"The following paper presents the use of regularized linear models as tools to optimize training process. The models were calculated by using data collected from race-walkers' training events. The models used predict the outcomes over a 3 km race and following a prescribed training plan. The material included a total of 122 training patterns made by 21 players. The methods of analysis include: classical model of OLS regression, ridge regression, LASSO regression and elastic net regression. In order to compare and choose the best method a cross-validation of the leave-one-out was used. All models were calculated using R language with additional packages. The best model was determined by the LASSO method which generates an error of about 26 seconds. The method has simplified the structure of the model by eliminating 5 out of 18 predictors.",2013,Applied Computer Science
Sparse permutation invariant covariance estimation,"The paper proposes a method for constructing a sparse estima- tor for the inverse covariance (concentration) matrix in high-dimensional settings. The estimator uses a penalized normal likelihood approach and forces sparsity by using a lasso-type penalty. We establish a rate of con- vergence in the Frobenius norm as both data dimension p and sample size n are allowed to grow, and show that the rate depends explicitly on how sparse the true concentration matrix is. We also show that a correlation- based version of the method exhibits better rates in the operator norm. We also derive a fast iterative algorithm for computing the estimator, which relies on the popular Cholesky decomposition of the inverse but produces a permutation-invariant estimator. The method is compared to other es- timators on simulated data and on a real data example of tumor tissue classification using gene expression data.",2008,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Estimation of the spatial weighting matrix for regular lattice data -- An adaptive lasso approach with cross-sectional resampling,"Spatial econometric research typically relies on the assumption that the spatial dependence structure is known in advance and is represented by a deterministic spatial weights matrix. Contrary to classical approaches, we investigate the estimation of sparse spatial dependence structures for regular lattice data. In particular, an adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) is used to select and estimate the individual connections of the spatial weights matrix. To recover the spatial dependence structure, we propose cross-sectional resampling, assuming that the random process is exchangeable. The estimation procedure is based on a two-step approach to circumvent simultaneity issues that typically arise from endogenous spatial autoregressive dependencies. The two-step adaptive lasso approach with cross-sectional resampling is verified using Monte Carlo simulations. Eventually, we apply the procedure to model nitrogen dioxide ($\mathrm{NO_2}$) concentrations and show that estimating the spatial dependence structure contrary to using prespecified weights matrices improves the prediction accuracy considerably.",2020,arXiv: Computation
Support recovery and sup-norm convergence rates for sparse pivotal estimation,"In high dimensional sparse regression, pivotal estimators are estimators for which the optimal regularization parameter is independent of the noise level. The canonical pivotal es-timator is the square-root Lasso, formulated along with its derivatives as a ""non-smooth + non-smooth"" optimization problem. Modern techniques to solve these include smoothing the datafitting term, to benefit from fast efficient proximal algorithms. In this work we show minimax sup-norm convergence rates for non smoothed and smoothed, single task and multitask square-root Lasso-type estima-tors. Thanks to our theoretical analysis, we provide some guidelines on how to set the smoothing hyperparameter, and illustrate on synthetic data the interest of such guidelines.",2020,ArXiv
[Missed opportunities for immunization in pediatric unit of the Bobo-Dioulasso hospital (Burkina Faso)].,"AIM
This study was to determine the prevalence of missed opportunities for immunization in the pediatrics unit of the Souro Sanou University Hospital.


METHODS
This was a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted from May to June 2010 involving children aged 0-11 months, accompanying persons and health personnel. Self-questionnaires were administered to health personnel in order to gage their knowledge of vaccination practices.


RESULTS
177 children including 101 girls and 49 health workers were recruited. The vaccination rate for children targeted by the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) was 38% in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso and the rate of missed vaccination occasions was 50%. The low level of parental education, ignorance of EPI targeted diseases and a poor organization of the vaccination unit were noted.


CONCLUSION
The overall strategy for vaccine administration should be rethought in a country with limited resources such as Burkina Faso to optimize immunization, EPI target diseases contributing to the mortality and morbidity in these regions.",2016,Le Mali medical
