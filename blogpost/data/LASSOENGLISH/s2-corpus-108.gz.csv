An adapted geographically weighted LASSO (Ada-GWL) model for predicting subway ridership,"Ridership prediction at station level plays a critical role in subway transportation planning. Among various existing ridership prediction methods, direct demand model has been recognized as an effective approach. However, direct demand models including geographically weighted regression (GWR) have rarely been studied for local model selection in ridership prediction. In practice, acquiring insights into subway ridership under multiple influencing factors from a local perspective is important for passenger flow management and transportation planning operations adapting to local conditions. In this study, we propose an adapted geographically weighted LASSO (Ada-GWL) framework for modelling subway ridership, which involves regression-coefficient shrinkage and local model selection. It takes subway network layout into account and adopts network-based distance metric instead of Euclidean-based distance metric, making it so-called adapted to the context of subway networks. The real-world case of Shenzhen Metro is used to elaborate our proposed model. The results show that the proposed Ada-GWL model performs the best compared with the global model (ordinary least square, GWR, GWR calibrated with network-based distance metric and geographically weighted LASSO (GWL) in terms of estimation error and goodness-of-fit. Through understanding the variation of each coefficient across space (elasticities) and variables selection of each station, it provides more realistic conclusions based on local analysis. Besides, through clustering analysis of the stations according to the regression coefficients, clustersâ€™ functional characteristics are found to be in compliance with the policy of functional land use in Shenzhen, indicating the high interpretability of Ada-GWL model from the spatial angle. In other words, the regression coefficients of different stations can provide us the local prospective to understand the influence of factors on stationsâ€™ ridership.",2020,Transportation
Temporal Gut Microbial Changes Predict Recurrent Clostridiodes Difficile Infection in Patients With and Without Ulcerative Colitis.,"BACKGROUND
Ulcerative colitis (UC) carries an increased risk of primary and recurrent Clostridiodes difficile infection (rCDI), and CDI is associated with UC flares. We hypothesized that specific fecal microbial changes associate with UC flare and rCDI.


METHODS
We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 57 patients with UC and CDI, CDI only, and UC only. Stool samples were collected at baseline, at the end of antibiotic therapy, and after reconstitution for 16S rRNA sequencing. The primary outcomes were recurrent UC flare and rCDI. Logistic regression and Lasso models were constructed for analysis.


RESULTS
There were 21 (45.7%) patients with rCDI, whereas 11 (34.4%) developed UC flare. Patients with rCDI demonstrated significant interindividual (Pâ€…=â€…0.008) and intraindividual differences (Pâ€…=â€…0.004) in community structure by Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) compared with non-rCDI. Two cross-validated Lasso regression models predicted risk of rCDI: a baseline model with female gender, hospitalization for UC in the past year, increased Ruminococcaceae and Verrucomicrobia, and decreased Eubacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Veillonellaceae (AuROC,â€…0.94); and a model 14 days after completion of antibiotics with female gender, increased Shannon diversity, Ruminococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, and decreased community richness and Faecalibacterium (AuROC,â€…0.9). Adding JSD between baseline and post-treatment samples to the latter model improved fit (AuROC,â€…0.94). A baseline model including UC hospitalization in the past year and increased Bacteroidetes was associated with increased risk for UC flare (AuROC,â€…0.88).


CONCLUSION
Fecal microbial features at baseline and after therapy predict rCDI risk in patients with and without UC. These results may help risk stratify patients to guide management.",2020,Inflammatory bowel diseases
Learning to measure for preshipment garment sizing,"Abstract Clothing is still manually manufactured for the most part nowadays, resulting in discrepancies between nominal and real dimensions, and potentially ill-fitting garments. Hence, it is common in the apparel industry to manually perform measures at preshipment time. We present an automatic method to obtain such measures from a single image of a garment that speeds up this task. It is generic and extensible in the sense that it does not depend explicitly on the garment shape or type. Instead, it learns through a probabilistic graphical model to identify the different contour parts. Subsequently, a set of Lasso regressors, one per desired measure, can predict the actual values of the measures. We present results on a dataset of 130 images of jackets and 98 of pants, of varying sizes and styles, obtaining 1.17 and 1.22â€¯cm of mean absolute error, respectively.",2018,Measurement
In VitroEffectof @2-Agonists on Bacterial KillingandSuperoxide Anion(02) ReleaseFromAlveolarMacrophages of PatientsWithChronicBronchitis*,"A newclassof long-acting @-adrenoceptor agonists has been studied in the last few years. Apparently, they display an important anti-inflammatory activity with an inhibition of different cellular functions. This study was carried out to compare a long-acting p2-agonist, formoterol, with a conventional short-acting one, salbutamol, on the release of superoxide anion (Or) and bacterial killing by alveolar macrophagesobtained with bronchoalveolarlavage (BAL) from 20 patients with chronic bronchitis.The O@ produc tion in basal conditionswas not affected by @5-agonists. On the contrary,after phagocytosisof opsonized zymosan 10' M formoterol significantly affected the phagocytic index (difference between stimulated and basal O@ release): 7.9Ã‚Â±2.0 nM O@/10@AM/lO mm vs 16.8Ã‚Â±2.5, p<O.000Ã¢â‚¬Âl. Bacterial killing was inhibited by the two drugs in a dose dependent way, but the effect of formoterol was more evident than that of salbutamol. After blocking @-receptors with propranolol, we observed a prevention of the (3magonist effects on both 0 release and bacterial killing. The inhibitionofthe alveolar macrophagefunctionsconsid ered in this study is evident for both @,-agonists, but it is signfficantly more pronounced for formoterol. Our data can be interpreted as one possible mechanism of the anti inflammatory effect described for long-acting @5@-agonists. On the other hand, also a potential suppression of pulmo nary antibacterial defenses must not be overlooked, partic ularly in chronic bronchitis, a disease characterized by recurrent airways infections. Whether current therapeutic dosages are sufficient to achieve anti-inflammatory or microbicidal suppressive effects of clinical relevance has not been demonstratedso far.

The Experiences and Complexities of Care-Seeking Behavior of People Living with HIV/AIDS: A Qualitative Study in Nigeria,"In 2009, approximately 2.98 million people in Nigeria were living with HIV/AIDS. More than 192,000 deaths were caused by AIDS and 2.175 million AIDS orphans are now living in Nigeria (UNAIDS, 2010). The availability of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) implies that people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) should be able to carry out daily activities like the rest of society. However, there are a number of hindrances to the utilization of care, leading to suboptimal effectiveness of available treatment (Hilhorst et al., 2006; Morolake et al., 2009). One of the factors seems to be stigma; PLWHA and their care givers have to cope with negative reactions from the people directly around them as well as from the community (Mwinituo & Mill, 2006; Mitchell et al., 2007; Sabin et al., 2008; Adewuya et al., 2009; Hejoaka, 2009; Demmer, 2011). A study carried out among home based care givers in KwaZulu Natal South Africa showed that home based care givers experience high levels of burden and are targets of HIV-related prejudice and discrimination (Singh et al., 2011). Not only does the discovery that one is infected with HIV lead to fear of progression into AIDS and fear of dying, it also creates an anticipation of negative social reactions among PLWHA. Sontag (1989) argues that it is not the suffering of the disease that is deeply feared, but the denigration that is suffered from having the disease that makes PLWHA vulnerable as individuals and within society. People in the community have a negative attitude towards PLWHA because they attribute the characteristic of promiscuity to those who are infected (Campbell et al., 2007). Societal norms and values in Nigeria are restrictive and secretive, while discussion about sex is often private for cultural and religious reasons (Ajuwon et al., 1998), making people who transgress these norms likely to be condemned because norms are very strong and strict. Several studies around the world (Amirkhanian et al., 2003; Singh et al., 2009; Stevelink et al., 2011; Vlassoff & Ali, 2011) and in Africa indicate that PLWHA are still discriminated against (Muyinda et al., 1997; Duffy, 2005; Shisana et al., 2005; Muula & Mfutso-Bengo, 2005; Hilhorst et al., 2006; Liamputtong et al., 2009; Morolake et al., 2009; Amuri et al., 2011), making them resort to varied ways of coping with their problems (Mbonu et al., 2009). Despite these studies indicating the presence of stigma, literature have equally acknowledged that one of the positive noticeable interventions in the fight of HIV/AIDS",2011,
Fast Modeling and Identification of Robot Dynamics Using the Lasso,"This paper presents an approach for fast modeling and identification of robot dynamics. By using a data-driven machine learning approach, the process is simplified considerably from the conventional analytical method. Regressor selection using the Lasso (l1-norm penalized least squares regression) is used. The method is explained with a simple example of a two-link direct-drive robot. Further demonstration is given by applying the method to a three-link belt-driven robot. Promising result has been demonstrated.Copyright Â© 2013 by ASME",2013,
Geometric Ergodicity of Gibbs Samplers in Bayesian Penalized Regression Models,"We consider three Bayesian penalized regression models and show that the respective deterministic scan Gibbs samplers are geometrically ergodic regardless of the dimension of the regression problem. We prove geometric ergodicity of the Gibbs samplers for the Bayesian fused lasso, the Bayesian group lasso, and the Bayesian sparse group lasso. Geometric ergodicity along with a moment condition results in the existence of a Markov chain central limit theorem for Monte Carlo averages and ensures reliable output analysis. Our results of geometric ergodicity allow us to also provide default starting values for the Gibbs samplers.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Feature selection for automated speech scoring,"Automated scoring systems used for the evaluation of spoken or written responses in language assessments need to balance good empirical performance with the interpretability of the scoring models. We compare several methods of feature selection for such scoring systems and show that the use of shrinkage methods such as Lasso regression makes it possible to rapidly build models that both satisfy the requirements of validity and intepretability, crucial in assessment contexts as well as achieve good empirical performance.",2015,
The behaviour of the White-backed Duck,"These observations on the White-backed Duck Thalassomis leuconotus were underÂ­ taken to check and extend those which Johnsgard (1967) made on captive birds, because of the apparent lack o f informaÂ­ tion on this species in the wild. They were made on ducks which were present for varying periods at three dams and one natural pan situated in the vicinity of the Witwatersrand, Transvaal, South Africa. The waters were relatively shallow, with maximum depths varying from two to six feet. Although sedges and other aquatic plants provided suitable nesting sites, no breeding took place during the period of observation, i.e. July 1968 to April 1969. The names of the various comfort moveÂ­ ments described are taken from M cÂ­ Kinney (1965) and for the movements associated with threat and copulation the names are taken from Johnsgard (1967).",1969,WWT Publications
Millimeter Wave Vehicular Channel Emulation: A Framework for Balancing Complexity and Accuracy â€ ,"We propose a general framework for the specification of a sparse representation of millimeter wave vehicular propagation channels and apply this to both synthetic data and real-world observations from channel sounding experiments. The proposed framework is based on the c-LASSO (complex Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) which minimizes the mean squared error of the sparse representation for a given number of degrees of freedom. By choosing the number of degrees of freedom, we balance the numerical complexity of the representation in the channel emulation against its accuracy in terms of the mean squared error. A key ingredient is the choice of basis of the representation and we discuss two options: the Fourier basis and its projection onto a given subband. The results indicate that the subband-projected Fourier basis is a low-complexity choice with high fidelity for representing clustered channel impulse responses. Finally, a sequential estimator is formulated which enforces a consistent temporal evolution of the geometry of the interacting objects in the propagation environment. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using both synthetic data and measured 60 GHz vehicular channel traces.",2018,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)"

Determining Personalized Community Health Needs by Feature Selection and Clustering,"The Center for Disease Control, through the Community Health Data Initiative (CHDI), has released a large dataset by county detailing the overall health indicators, demographics, and major risk factors and causes of morbidity and mortality in the US. In order to address the heterogeneity of community healthcare in the US, k-Means clustering was performed on the CHDI dataset to determine community subtypes in terms of health challenges and outcomes. The optimal number of eight clusters was determined by the Elbow Method, and clusters were analyzed to determine significant differences in demographic. In order to determine community-specific healthcare solutions and directions, feature selection and modeling of healthcare outcomes was performed for each of the eight subtypes using LASSO regression. It was determined that different features significantly impact health outcomes in the different clusters, providing information about the unique health challenges faced by these different types of communities. LASSO regression using the entire unclustered dataset yielded significantly poorer results on the sub-clusters in terms of model performance, further supporting the claim that modeling community-specific needs is a vital step for delivering accurate and adequate community healthcare. These results have the potential to inform policymaking at the local/municipal level, as well as inform the approaches taken by primary practitioners to address community needs.",2020,medRxiv
Breeding ecology of Antarctic petrels and southern fulmars in coastal Antarctica,"Seabirds at high latitudes breed in environments with short, but highly productive, summers. Not many species can utilize these narrow windows of time to complete the full breeding cycle, but fulmarine petrels (Procellariiformes, Procellariidae) appear particularly well adapted because of a relatively short period in which they raise their chick. We developed an automatic weighing system with artificial nests to study food provisioning and chick growth. During three seasons (1997-1999), we collected data on chick provisioning of Southern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialoides) and Antarctic Petrels (Thalassoica antarctica) on Ardery Island (66Â°S 110Â°E) near the Australian Antarctic station Casey. Although Southern Fulmars started breeding about 2.5 weeks later than Antarctic Petrels, both were similar in total duration of the breeding period (97 days) and in the diet they provide to their chicks. Southern Fulmars delivered meals to their chicks about every 14 hours, almost twice as frequent as Antarctic Petrels. Meal sizes varied between the seasons and species, and averaged from 111g to 152g. On average, Southern Fulmars delivered 240-265 gram per day to their chick, whereas Antarctic petrels delivered 122-140 gram per day. Southern Fulmars were delivering in a more pronounced bimodal distribution pattern and provisioned their chicks more during daylight than Antarctic Petrels. Antarctic Petrels did not compensate their lower chick-feeding rate through larger meals, but their prolonged foraging trips probably enable them to process more of the food into stomach oil and thus produce meals with a higher energy density. Furthermore, Southern Fulmar chicks need more energy for thermoregulation and are thus less efficient in converting food into body mass. By using a â€œdouble Gompertz growth modelâ€ we were able to investigate both chick growth until peak mass and mass recession until fledging. We investigated the differences in growth between species and how the provisioning and growth parameters were correlated. The average peak mass of chicks was 140% of the mean adult mass in Southern Fulmars and 136% in Antarctic Petrels. At fledging, Southern Fulmar chicks were on average 101.5% and Antarctic Petrels chicks 91.7% of the mean adult mass. In Southern Fulmars, the provisioning rate was positively correlated with growth rate, peak mass and fledging mass, but in the Antarctic Petrel these correlations were not significant, probably due to low samples size. The differences in chick provisioning fit in the overall strategies of two related seabird species that have to adapt to conditions at opposite extremes of their main habitats.",2010,
Nomogram for Predicting Cardiovascular Mortality in Incident Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: An Observational Study,"Cardiovascular mortality risk is high for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients but it varies considerably among individuals. There is no clinical tool to predict cardiovascular mortality for PD patients yet. Therefore, we developed a cardiovascular mortality risk nomogram in a PD patient cohort. We derived and internally validated the nomogram in incident adult PD patients randomly assigned to a training (Nâ€‰=â€‰918) or a validation (Nâ€‰=â€‰460) dataset. The nomogram was built using the LASSO Cox regression model. Increasing age, history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes were consistent predictors of cardiovascular mortality. Low hemoglobin and serum albumin, high hypersensitive C-reactive protein and decreasing 24â€‰hours urine output were identified as non-traditional cardiovascular risk predictors. In the validation dataset, the above nomogram performed good discrimination (1 year c-statisticâ€‰=â€‰0.83; 3 year c-statisticâ€‰=â€‰0.78) and calibration. This tool can classify patients between those at high risk of cardiovascular mortality (high-risk group) and those of low risk (low-risk group). Cardiovascular mortality was significantly different in the internal validation set of patients for the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group (HR 3.77, 2.14â€“6.64; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). This novel nomogram can accurately predict cardiovascular mortality risk in incident PD patients.",2017,Scientific Reports
Integrative Gene Expression Profiling Analysis to Investigate Potential Prognostic Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer,"BACKGROUND Despite noteworthy advancements in the multidisciplinary treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) and deeper understanding in the molecular mechanisms of CRC, many of CRC patients with histologically identical tumors present different treatment response and prognosis. Thus, more evidence on novel predictive and prognostic biomarkers for CRC remains urgently needed. This study aims to identify potential prognostic biomarkers for CRC with integrative gene expression profiling analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Differential expression analysis of paired CRC and adjacent normal tissue samples in 6 microarray datasets was independently performed, and the 6 datasets were integrated by the robust rank aggregation method to detect consistent differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Aberrant expression patterns of these genes were further validated in RNA sequencing data. Then, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to investigate significantly dysregulated biological functions in CRC. Finally, univariate, LASSO and multivariate Cox regression models were built to identify key prognostic genes in CRC patients. RESULTS A total of 990 DEGs (495 downregulated and 495 upregulated genes) were acquired after integratedly analyzing the 6 microarray datasets, and 4131 DEGs (2050 downregulated and 2081 upregulated genes) were obtained from the RNA sequencing dataset. Subsequently, these DEGs were intersected and 885 consistent DEGs were finally identified, including 458 downregulated and 427 upregulated genes. Two risky prognostic genes (TIMP1 and LZTS3) and 5 protective prognostic genes (AXIN2, CXCL1, ITLN1, CPT2 and CLDN23) were identified, which were significantly associated with the prognosis of CRC. CONCLUSIONS The 7 genes that we identified would provide more evidence for further applying novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in clinical practice to facilitate personalized treatment of CRC.",2020,Medical Science Monitor : International Medical Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research

Predictive ability of genome-assisted statistical models under various forms of gene action,"Recent work has suggested that the performance of prediction models for complex traits may depend on the architecture of the target traits. Here we compared several prediction models with respect to their ability of predicting phenotypes under various statistical architectures of gene action: (1) purely additive, (2) additive and dominance, (3) additive, dominance, and two-locus epistasis, and (4) purely epistatic settings. Simulation and a real chicken dataset were used. Fourteen prediction models were compared: BayesA, BayesB, BayesC, Bayesian LASSO, Bayesian ridge regression, elastic net, genomic best linear unbiased prediction, a Gaussian process, LASSO, random forests, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regression, ridge regression (best linear unbiased prediction), relevance vector machines, and support vector machines. When the trait was under additive gene action, the parametric prediction models outperformed non-parametric ones. Conversely, when the trait was under epistatic gene action, the non-parametric prediction models provided more accurate predictions. Thus, prediction models must be selected according to the most probably underlying architecture of traits. In the chicken dataset examined, most models had similar prediction performance. Our results corroborate the view that there is no universally best prediction models, and that the development of robust prediction models is an important research objective.",2018,Scientific Reports
Metabolomics based markers predict type 2 diabetes in a 14-year follow-up study,"BackgroundThe growing field of metabolomics has opened up new opportunities for prediction of type 2 diabetes (T2D) going beyond the classical biochemistry assays.ObjectivesWe aimed to identify markers from different pathways which represent early metabolic changes and test their predictive performance for T2D, as compared to the performance of traditional risk factors (TRF).MethodsWe analyzed 2776 participants from the Erasmus Rucphen Family study from which 1571 disease free individuals were followed up to 14-years. The targeted metabolomics measurements at baseline were performed by three different platforms using either nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. We selected 24 T2D markers by using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection operator (LASSO) regression and tested their association to incidence of disease during follow-up.ResultsThe 24 markers i.e. high-density, low-density and very low-density lipoprotein sub-fractions, certain triglycerides, amino acids, and small intermediate compounds predicted future T2D with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81. The performance of the metabolic markers compared to glucose was significantly higher among the young (ageâ€‰<â€‰50 years) (0.86 vs. 0.77, p-value <0.0001), the female (0.88 vs. 0.84, p-value =0.009), and the lean (BMIâ€‰<â€‰25Â kg/m2) (0.85 vs. 0.80, p-value =0.003). The full model with fasting glucose, TRFs, and metabolic markers yielded the best prediction model (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.89).ConclusionsOur novel prediction model increases the long-term prediction performance in combination with classical measurements, brings a higher resolution over the complexity of the lipoprotein component, increasing the specificity for individuals in the low risk group.",2017,Metabolomics
Development and validation of lncRNAs-based nomogram for prediction of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer by bioinformatics analysis,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Early biochemical recurrence (BCR) was considered as a sign for clinical recurrence and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa). The purpose of the present study was to identify a lncRNA-based nomogram that can predict BCR of PCa accurately. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis, such as propensity score matching (PSM) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analyses were used to identify candidate lncRNAs for further bioinformatics analysis. LASSO Cox regression model was used to select the most significant prognostic lncRNAs and construct the lncRNAs signature for predicting BCR in discovery set. Additionally, a nomogram based on our lncRNAs signature was also formulated. Both lncRNAs signature and nomogram were validated in test set. GSEA was carried out to identify various lncRNAs sets which share a common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. RESULTS: A total of 457 patients with sufficient BCR information were included in our analysis. Finally, a five lncRNAs signature significantly associated with BCR was identified in discovery set (HR=0.44, 95%CI: 0.27-0.72, C-index = 0.63) and validated in test set (HR=0.22, 95%CI: 0.09-0.56, C-index = 0.65). Additionally, the lncRNAs-based nomogram showed significant performance for predicting BCR in both discovery set (C-index = 0.74) and test set (C-index = 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our lncRNAs-based nomogram is a reliable prognostic tool for BCR in PCa patients. In addition, the present study put forward the direction for the further investigation on the mechanism of PCa progression. Figure. No caption available. Figure. No caption available.

Support Stability of Spike Deconvolution via Total Variation Minimization,"Spike deconvolution is an inverse problem aiming at recovering point sources from their convolution with a point spread function (PSF). The stability of this problem in the presence of noise is long known to be closely related to the separation between those sources. It is therefore essential to characterize the resolution limit above which the point sources can be stably recovered from a given estimator, without spurious or missing sources from the estimate. In this paper, we establish the resolution limit above which the Beurling-LASSO estimator can stably recover two point sources, and show that the limit depends only on the PSF. Our result highlights the impact of PSF on the resolution limit in the noisy setting, which was not evident in previous studies of the noiseless setting. We further confirm our findings by comparing the theoretical limit with the empirical performance of the Beurling-LASSO estimator.",2020,2020 54th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)
Identification of a m6A RNA methylation regulators-based signature for predicting the prognosis of clear cell renal carcinoma,"The mortality rate of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains high. The aim of this study was to identify novel prognostic biomarkers by using m6A RNA methylation regulators capable of improving the risk-stratification criteria of survival for ccRCC patients. The gene expression data of 16 m6A methylation regulators and its relevant clinical information were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The expression pattern of these m6A methylation regulators were evaluated. Consensus clustering analysis was conducted to identify clusters of ccRCC patients with different prognosis. Univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to construct multiple-gene risk signature. A survival analysis was carried out to determine the independent prognostic significance of the signature. Five m6A-related genes (ZC3H13, METTL14, YTHDF2, YTHDF3 and HNRNPA2B1) showed significantly downregulated in tumor tissue, while seven regulators (YTHDC2, FTO, WTAP, METTL3, ALKBH5, RBM15 and KIAA1429) was remarkably upregulated in ccRCC. Consensus clustering analysis identified two clusters of ccRCC with significant differences in overall survival (OS) and tumor stage between them. We also constructed a two-gene signature, METTL3 and METTL14, serving as an independent prognostic indicator for distinguishing ccRCC patients with different prognosis both in training, validation and our own clinical datasets. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve indicated the area under the curve (AUC) in these three datasets were 0.721, 0.684 and 0.828, respectively, demonstrated that the prognostic signature had a good prediction efficiency. m6A methylation regulators exert as potential biomarkers for prognostic stratification of ccRCC patients and may assist clinicians achieving individualized treatment for this patient population.",2020,Cancer Cell International

Application of penalized linear regression and ensemble methods for drought forecasting in Northeast China,"Effective drought prediction can be conducive to mitigating some of the effects of drought. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used for developing drought prediction models due to their high efficiency and accuracy. This study explored the ability of several machine learning models based on penalized linear regression and decision tree (DT)-based ensemble methods to predict drought conditions represented by the Standardized Precipitationâ€“Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in Northeast China. We compared the forecasting performance of the penalized linear regression models based on ridge regression (RR) and lasso regression (LR) with the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. In addition, the AdaBoost and Random Forests (RF) models were also used to explore the suitability of ensemble methods for improving the forecasting performance. The SPEI was forecast at the different timescales of 3, 6, 12, and 24Â months using the aforementioned machine learning models and the indices were used to predict short-term and long-term drought conditions. The prediction results indicated that the penalized linear regression models provided better prediction results and the ensemble methods consistently outperformed the DT model. Overall, the LR models were the optimum models for forecasting the SPEI at different timescales in Northeast China.",2019,Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics
Model Selection and estimation of Multi Screen Penalty,"We propose a multi-step method, called Multi Screen Penalty (MSP), to estimate high-dimensional sparse linear models. MSP uses a series of small and adaptive penalty to iteratively estimate the regression coefficients. This structure is shown to greatly improve the model selection and estimation accuracy, i.e., it precisely selects the true model when the irrepresentable condition fails; under mild regularity conditions, MSP estimator can achieve the rate $\sqrt{q \log n /n}$ for the upper bound of l_2-norm error. At each step, we restrict the selection of MSP only on the reduced parameter space obtained from the last step; this makes its computational complexity is roughly comparable to Lasso. This algorithm is found to be stable and reaches to high accuracy over a range of small tuning parameters, hence deletes the cross-validation segment. Numerical comparisons show that the method works effectively both in model selection and estimation and nearly uniformly outperform others. We apply MSP and other methods to financial data. MSP is successful in assets selection and produces more stable and lower rates of fitted/predicted errors.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Learning improved pooling regions for the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature for buried threat detection in ground penetrating radar,"In recent years, the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has successfully been applied to the problem of buried threat detection (BTD). A large body of research has focused on using computerized algorithms to automatically discriminate between buried threats and subsurface clutter in GPR data. For this purpose, the GPR data is frequently treated as an image of the subsurface, within which the reflections associated with targets often appear with a characteristic shape. In recent years, shape descriptors from the natural image processing literature have been applied to buried threat detection, and the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) feature has achieved state-of-the-art performance. HOG consists of computing histograms of the image gradients in disjoint square regions, which we call pooling regions, across the GPR images. In this work we create a large body of potential pooling regions and use the group LASSO (GLASSO) to choose a subset of the pooling regions that are most appropriate for BTD on GPR data. We examined this approach on a large collection of GPR data using lane-based cross-validation, and the results indicate that GLASSO can select a subset of pooling regions that lead to superior performance to the original HOG feature, while simultaneously also reducing the total number of features needed. The selected pooling regions also provide insight about the regions in GPR images that are most important for discriminating threat and nonthreat data.",2017,
Is Your Story Going to Spread Like a Virus ? Machine Learning Methods for News Popularity Prediction,"Online website has been the majority source for news to spread. An interesting news is going to be shared thousands of times through the Internet. In this project, we tried different methods to predict the popularity before its publication. Using over 39000 sample articles from Mashable.com, we tried to address the problem both as a numerical and a multinomial classification problem. Specifically, we applied linear regression, polynomial regression, GAM with smoothing splines and Lasso to predict the exact shares. The best CV error result is 0.7649 acquired by GAM with smoothing splines. And then we used SVM, Random Forest and Bagging to predict popularity, which is divided into four categories, for each article. In this case, Random Forest gives us the best result, which achieves 50.4% prediction accuracy.",2015,

"Endangered Species, Lassoes, and Unmet Promises","I. INTRODUCTION II. A LEARNING EXPERIENCE III. DOING BETTER NEXT TIME A. Endangered Species B. Lassoes C. Unmet Promises IV. CONCLUSION I. INTRODUCTION The Eighth Circuit, in its famously evocative scolding of the Federal Communications Commission CFCC"") for overstepping its jurisdiction, wrote that the division between state and federal regulatory responsibilities was defended by a fence that was ""hog tight, horse high, and bull strong...."" (1) We Easterners, who thought we had done a pretty good job of anticipating in the 1996 Telecommunications Act (""1996 Act"") and its implementing regulations what would be necessary to jump start competition, chuckled over this amusing regionalism. We also agreed that one of the best things about the 1996 Act was that it did not require all appeals to go to the District of Columbia Circuit where such colorful words would have been doused with bleach before seeing the light of day in a published opinion. I suggest in this Essay, in homage to the Eighth Circuit's metaphor, a three-part image of what to anticipate in the rewriting of the 1996 Act, whether that occurs wholesale or piecemeal over the next months or years: endangered species, lassoes, and unmet promises. As developed below, endangered species are legacy concepts that may not--some would say should not--survive the next rewrite. Lassoes apply to fields that are not typically regulated as part of telecommunications, but are increasingly susceptible to being roped into telecommunications regulation, for better or worse. Unmet promises are found largely in the area of public safety spectrum policy and reflect the real-world problems that have cropped up and remain unaddressed while the bulk of telecommunications policy remains aimed at facilitating commercial service offerings. II. A LEARNING EXPERIENCE The eight years following the Eighth Circuit's opinion, rounding out a decade of experience with the 1996 Act, would prove that the authors of the 1996 Act, of which there were many in the government and in the private sector, underestimated some things and overestimated others. The mantra that the authors did not foresee the importance of the Internet is one of the most repeated pieces of conventional wisdom about the 1996 Act. It does not matter whether that assertion is literally true; what is certainly true is that no one could have predicted the brisk adoption rates and price decreases that made Internet access and the applications dependent upon them so popular in both residential and business settings. In this sense, the authors underestimated the impact of the Internet. (2) The authors also overestimated how easy it would be for competitors to the incumbent local exchange carriers (""ILECs"") to induce customers to switch providers and thereby gain market share and revenue that would make them sustainable businesses. They also overestimated the ability of a system of regulations to create the conditions for allowing competition to gain a foothold. Whatever impediments the ILECs may have placed in the road for competitors, the on-the-ground reality for the competitors' sales teams was that getting customers to accept the risk of switching carriers was difficult. Customers were hesitant to do so unless they were extremely dissatisfied with the incumbent for their own reasons or the competitors could promise significant long-term savings, which created a business plan at war with itself. In the first years after the 1996 Act's passage, the February anniversary of its enactment was a grim, geeky commemoration for its authors and adherents. Those still in government geared up for the day with briefing books and talking points for their principals urging patience in the wait for competition. The press published annual reviews of progress and pratfalls in the 1996 Act's implementation. (3) The authors' protestations that it was too soon to tell was an unsatisfying retort. â€¦",2006,Federal Communications Law Journal
Variational Bayesian weighted complex network reconstruction,"Complex network reconstruction is a hot topic in many fields. Currently, the most popular data-driven reconstruction framework is based on lasso. However, it is found that, in the presence of noise, lasso loses efficiency for weighted networks. This paper builds a new framework to cope with this problem. The key idea is to employ a series of linear regression problems to model the relationship between network nodes, and then to use an efficient variational Bayesian algorithm to infer the unknown coefficients. The numerical experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the new method outperforms lasso with regard to both reconstruction accuracy and running speed.",2020,Inf. Sci.
Statistical Downscaling to Predict Monthly Rainfall Using Generalized Linear Model with Gamma Distribution,"Statistical Downscaling (SDS) models might involve ill-conditioned covariates (large dimension and high correlation/multicollinear). This problem could be solved by a variable selection technique using L1 regularization/LASSO or a dimension reduction approach using principal component analysis (PCA). In this paper, both methods were applied to generalized linear modeling with gamma distribution and compared to predict rainfall models at 11 rain posts in Indramayu. More over, generalized linear model with gamma distribution was used to obtain non-negative rainfall prediction and compared with principal component regression (PCR). Two types of ill-conditioned data with different characteristics (CMIP5 and GPCP version 2.2) were used as covariates in SDS modeling. The results show that three methods (PCR, Gamma-PC, and Gamma-L1) did not demonstrate significant difference in term of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) after addition of dummy variables (month) in the models. However, a generalized linear modeling with gamma distribution could be considered as the best methods since it provided non-negative rainfall predictions.",2016,
Strong Semantic Systematicity from Hebbian,"Fodor's and Pylyshyn's stand on systematicity in thought and language has been debated and criticized. Van Gelder and Niklasson, among others, have argued that Fodor and Pylyshyn offer no precise definition of systematicity. However, our concern here is with a learning based formulation of that concept. In particular, Hadley has proposed that a network exhibits strong semantic systematicity when, as a result of training, it can assign appropriate meaning representations to novel sentences (both simple and embedded) which contain words in syntactic positions they did not occupy during training. The experience of researchers indicates that strong systematicity in any form is difficult to achieve in connectionist systems. Herein we describe a network which displays strong semantic systematicity in response to Hebbian, connectionist training. During training, two-thirds of all nouns are presented only in a single syntactic position (either as grammatical subject or object). Yet, during testing, the network correctly interprets thousands of sentences containing those nouns in novel positions. In addition, the network generalizes to novel levels of embedding. Successful training requires a corpus of about 1000 sentences, and network training is quite rapid. The architecture and learning algorithms are purely connectionist, but 'classical' insights are discernible in one respect, viz. that complex semantic representations spatially contain their semantic constituents. However, in other important respects, the architecture is distinctly non-classical.",1997,
"Tutz , Binder : Boosting Ridge Regression","Ridge regression is a well established method to shrink regression parameters towards zero, thereby securing existence of estimates. The present paper investigates several approaches to combining ridge regression with boosting techniques. In the direct approach the ridge estimator is used to fit iteratively the current residuals yielding an alternative to the usual ridge estimator. In partial boosting only part of the regression parameters are reestimated within one step of the iterative procedure. The technique allows to distinguish between variables that are always included in the analysis and variables that are chosen only if relevant. The resulting procedure selects variables in a similar way as the Lasso, yielding a reduced set of influential variables. The suggested procedures are investigated within the classical framework of continuous response variables as well as in the case of generalized linear models. In a simulation study boosting procedures for different stopping criteria are investigated and the performance in terms of prediction and the identification of relevant variables is compared to several competitors as the Lasso and the more recently proposed elastic net. For the evaluation of the identification of relevant variables pseudo ROC curves are introduced.",2007,
Sing Compline with Fr. Weber,"Cantiones Sacrae Simplices: Twelve Easy SATB Motets, with Optional Psalm Tones in English & Latin, 1st edition, by Kevin Allen. Corpus Christi, Tex.: Corpus Christi Watershed, [2011]. 72 pp. $28 ($16 for 10 or more) Commissioned by Corpus Christi Watershed, Kevin Allen's new anthology of motets for SATB choir a cappella is filled with gems of stunning beauty. The composer's aim was ""to present a collection of simple motets, using liturgical texts that can be sung as Propers or at any other time during the course of the Church Year."" (1) Mr. Allen's sacred choral music features a polyphonic style that pays homage to Orlando di Lasso, yet his harmonic language is accessibly modern. What is it that makes these motets simple? Can they truly be sung by a beginning choir? The composer states that he has ""taken care to limit vocal range and complicated rhythms, in addition to keeping the length of the motets relatively short."" (2) Many parish choirs would not find these motets to be simple, but they should take heart! Corpus Christi Watershed has again collaborated with vocal wonder Matthew J. Curtis--singing soprano, alto, tenor, and bass--to provide practice videos of the motets. Each motet features a ""Balanced Voices Practice Video,"" in which all four voices can be heard in a finished performance. In addition, there is a practice video for each voice in the following formats: ""Part Predominant,"" ""Part Muted,"" and ""Part Left Channel."" This will assure that each choir member has access to a performance that is sung with beautiful vocal tone, perfect intonation, and superb artistic interpretation. Another benefit to parish choirs is that the vocal parts stay within comfortable ranges. For the choir lacking tenor voices, altos could sing the tenor parts with little difficulty. In order to make these motets even more useful for parish choirs, Corpus Christi Watershed has added optional psalm verses that may be sung, if needed, along with the motets. The verses are provided in Latin (with square notation) and in English (with stemless modern notation). For a couple of the motets the reviewer would suggest some different options for executing the psalm-tone verses that use Gregorian psalm tones. Tone 4 would work as well as Tone 2 for Justitiae Domini, and the same psalm tone could also be used for Domine convertere. Kevin Allen's Cantiones sacrae simplices is coil-bound in beautiful and ornate covers inspired by the Kelmscott Press of William Morris or Pothier's Les melodies gregoriennes d'apres la tradition, as published by Desclee.

Factors related to parental pre-treatment motivation in outpatient child and adolescent mental health care,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between a variety of child, parent, family and environmental factors and pre-treatment motivation of parents of children and adolescents newly referred to a mental health care clinic in The Netherlands. Data were collected of 521 parents most involved in the upbringing of the child (443 mothers and 78 fathers; Dutch origin 97.1%) of 207 girls and 314 boys (age Mâ€‰=â€‰10.2, range 1â€“18 years). Treatment motivation was measured by the Parent Motivation Inventory. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to investigate the prediction strength of 33 factors in 5 domains: (1) source of referral and prior use of healthcare services, (2) child characteristics, (3) characteristics of the primary parent, (4) parenting characteristics of the primary parent, and (5) family characteristics. Twenty-one factors were statistically relevant, explaining 21.3% of the deviance in pre-treatment motivation. Child characteristics, mainly type and severity of problems, contributed most to the model. Notably, internalising problems contributed more than externalising problems. Furthermore, we found relations between parental pre-treatment motivation and parents' perceived self-efficacy, parents' perceived parenting competence, financial problems and source of referral. Our findings provide insight into the multifacetedness of parental motivation prior to starting treatment and inform health professionals of specific contextual factors of interest in parents' readiness to change their behaviour and participate in treatment.",2019,European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry
Sparse group lasso and high dimensional multinomial classification,"The sparse group lasso optimization problem is solved using a coordinate gradient descent algorithm. The algorithm is applicable to a broad class of convex loss functions. Convergence of the algorithm is established, and the algorithm is used to investigate the performance of the multinomial sparse group lasso classifier. On three different real data examples the multinomial group lasso clearly outperforms multinomial lasso in terms of achieved classification error rate and in terms of including fewer features for the classification. An implementation of the multinomial sparse group lasso algorithm is available in the R package msgl. Its performance scales well with the problem size as illustrated by one of the examples considered-a 50 class classification problem with 10 k features, which amounts to estimating 500 k parameters.",2014,Comput.

Detecting disease-causing genes by LASSO-Patternsearch algorithm,"The Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 Problem 3 simulated rheumatoid arthritis data set provided 100 replicates of simulated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and covariate data sets for 1500 families with an affected sib pair and 2000 controls, modeled after real rheumatoid arthritis data. The data generation model included nine unobserved trait loci, most of which have one or more of the generated SNPs associated with them. These data sets provide an ideal experimental test bed for evaluating new and old algorithms for selecting SNPs and covariates that can separate cases from controls, because the cases and controls are known as well as the identities of the trait loci. LASSO-Patternsearch is a new multi-step algorithm with a LASSO-type penalized likelihood method at its core specifically designed to detect and model interactions between important predictor variables. In this article the original LASSO-Patternsearch algorithm is modified to handle the large number of SNPs plus covariates. We start with a screen step within the framework of parametric logistic regression. The patterns that survived the screen step were further selected by a penalized logistic regression with the LASSO penalty. And finally, a parametric logistic regression model were built on the patterns that survived the LASSO step. In our analysis of Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 Problem 3 data we have identified most of the associated SNPs and relevant covariates. Upon using the model as a classifier, very competitive error rates were obtained.",2007,BMC Proceedings
Beyond Lassos: Complete SMT-Based Bounded Model Checking for Timed Automata,"Timed automata (TAs) are a common formalism for modeling timed systems. Bounded model checking (BMC) is a verification method that searches for runs violating a property using a SAT or SMT solver. Previous SMT-based BMC approaches for TAs search for finite counter-examples and infinite lasso-shaped counter-examples. This paper shows that lasso-based BMC cannot detect counter-examples for some linear time specifications expressed, e.g., with LTL or Buchi automata. This paper introduces a new SMT-based BMC approach that can find a counter-example to any non-holding Buchi automaton or LTL specification and also, in theory, prove that a specification holds. Different BMC encodings tailored for the supported features of different SMT solvers are compared experimentally to lasso-based BMC and discretization-based SAT BMC.",2012,
Bayesian Interpretations of Regularization for Models with Many Predictors: An Introduction for Management Researchers,"This manuscript provides a tutorial for management researchers on modern methods of regularization. Regularization methods are tools to help researchers avoid overestimating the coefficients of individual predictor variables in multiple regression, especially in high-dimensional problems. Such methods introduce some bias into estimates, at greatly reduced variance: regularized models will typically fit somewhat worse in-sample but will generalize better than unregularized models out-of-sample. These regularization techniques can be implemented using a classical, Frequentist methods, but have natural implementations using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. We provide the Bayesian interpretation of the most common Frequentist regularization techniques, the ridge and the lasso. We describe the theory in elementary terms, and provide worked examples to demonstrate how regularized estimates can be obtained using the freely available R statistical computing environment and JAGS Bayesian analysis engine.",2014,
On the Efficacy of Mathematical Techniques for Modeling Brain Functional Connectivity,"Functional connectivity is measured as the temporal coherence or correlation between the activities of disjoint brain areas. The direct statistical dependency between every two brain regions in the functional network can be obtained using the partial correlation method. Partial correlations can be computed efficiently if a sufficient number of data points are available. However, in most FMRI studies, computing partial correlations is a daunting challenge due to the limitation on the number samples available from fMRI scans. Therefore, functional connectivity is often defined based on the sample correlation matrix. To eliminate week correlations and sparsify the brain functional network, sample correlations are often thresholded to some pre-specified level. As an alternative technique, graphical lasso has become popular in the literature for identifying the direct correlations between the activities of different parts of the brain using a small number of samples. In this work, we investigate the performance of these two techniques on: (i) synthetic data produced by an electrical circuit model with certain structural properties, and (ii) resting state-fMRI data. In addition, we compare these techniques with a heuristic algorithm known as Cow-Liu that finds a maximum weight spanning tree of a weighted graph. Our study shows that the simple method of thresholding the correlation matrix and the computationally-expensive graphical lasso algorithm both create false positives and negatives that wrongly imply some network properties such as small-worldness. Furthermore, we show that the Chow-Liu algorithm is able to recover most of the network topology for an acyclic network. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithm for generalizing the Chow-Liu algorithm to cyclic graphs. 1. Significance Statement In recent years, there has been a growing interest in studying the human brain functional networks using functional MRI. To obtain a physiologically meaningful representation of brain functional networks, it is desirable Email addresses: sojoudi@berkeley.edu (Somayeh Sojoudi), doyle@caltech.edu (John C. Doyle) to identify the direct relationships between the variabilities of different brain regions rather than indirect correlations. However, due to the availability of a limited number of samples in practice, it is a daunting challenge to estimate these direct relationships. In this work, we develop a framework that allows us to systematically evaluate the performance of some popular techniques in modeling brain functional networks. Moreover, we offer a new heuristic algorithm that would outperform the previous techniques under different scenarios.",2015,
"Prediction and Variable Selection with Multicollinear, High-Dimensional Macroeconomic Data","Lasso is increasingly found in the economics literature, but boosting, which is a simple and flexible high-dimensional estimation procedure that has been used successfully in genetics, computer science, and other fields, is not familiar to most economists. I describe the close theoretical ties between a linear varient of general gradient boosting, L2-Boosting, and lasso and the conditions required for each to guarantee prediction and model selection consistency. For the first time in the economics literature, I compare the performance of boosting and lasso for both variable selection and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, I address the specific issues that arise under block-correlation typically found in macroeconomic datasets. In simulations, I find that lasso selects a more parsimonious model that is closer to the truth while maintaining prediction accuracy. In an application to forecasting series in the FRED-MD dataset, I find that the forecasting performance of L2-boost and lasso are close to equivalent at 1 month forecast horizons and significantly better than the AR baseline, with mixed results at the 6 month horizon. There are some indications that a non-linear form of gradient boosting has the best performance for longer time horizons. Since I show that lasso and boosting are not stable under correlated data and lack of sparsity, I describe how for macroeconomic data the variable selection output can be interpreted more robustly by aggregating variables in groupings.",2018,
The local control of mammalian spermatogenesis,"SummaryInvestigations of the ultrastructure of mammalian spermatogenesis have revealed intercellular bridges in all cell generations of the germinal epithelium. Desmosomes connect Sertoli cells with associated Sertoli cells (Sertoli cell â€” Sertoli cell junction) and with adjacent cells of the germinal epithelium. To provide evidence for the different types of cell connections in all developmental stages of spermatogenesis the various cell generations had to be worked out. This was achieved by considering the morphology of the nuclei and the relation of the cells to cell associations of the spermatogenic cycle in which they have been observed.These observations led us to a hypothesis explaining the local control of the spermatogenic cycle. According to this hypothesis all cells of one developmental stage within a given cell association are interconnected by intercellular bridges, thus forming a syncytium which contains each complete layer of a cell association. This explains the synchronous development of the cell layers. The coordination of the development of different layers of one cell association is effected by Sertoli cells. To achieve this organization of the spermatogenic cycle the entire cell population of one cell association has to be derived from one common embryonic stem cell. The evidence for this hypothesis is discussed.ZusammenfassungUntersuchungen der Ultrastruktur der Spermatogenese der SÃ¤uger haben intercellulÃ¤re BrÃ¼cken in allen Zellgenerationen des Keimepithels ergeben. Desmosomen verbinden die Sertolizellen untereinander (Sertolizelle â€” Sertolizell-Verbindungen) und mit den benachbarten Zellen des Keimepithels. Um die verschiedenen Formen von Zellverbindungen in allen Entwicklungsstadien der Spermatogenese nachzuweisen, muÃŸten die unterschiedlichen Zellgenerationen bestimmt werden. Dies wurde erreicht durch Beachtung der Morphologie der Zellkerne und durch die Zuordnung der Zellen zu den Zellassoziationen, in welchen sie beobachtet wurden.Diese Beobachtungen fÃ¼hrten uns zu einer Hypothese, durch die die lokale Steuerung der Spermatogenese erklÃ¤rt wird. Nach dieser Hypothese sind alle Zellen eines Entwicklungsstadiums innerhalb einer Zellassoziation durch intercellulÃ¤re BrÃ¼cken verbunden. Hierdurch wird ein Syncytium gebildet, welches jeweils gesamte Zellschichten einer Zellassoziation umfaÃŸt. Auf diese Weise wird die synchrone Entwicklung innerhalb der Zellschichten erklÃ¤rt. Die Koordination der Entwicklung von verschiedenen Zellschichten einer Zellassoziation wird durch Sertolizellen bewirkt. Um diese Organisation des Spermatogenesecyclus zu erreichen, muÃŸ die Zellpopulation einer Zellassoziation von einer gemeinsamen embryonalen Stammzelle abstammen.

"Die Hemmung des P-Glykoprotein-mediierten, transepithelialen Zytostatikatransportes durch R-Verapamil, Cyclosporin SDZ PSC-833 und Tamoxifen in einem Adenokarzinom-Monolayer-Modell","ZusammenfassungGrundlagenDie Multidrug-Resistenz (MDR) gilt als wichtiger Chemoresistenzmechanismus besonders bei hÃ¤matologischen, aber auch bei soliden Malignomen. Inhibitoren des MDR-Effektors P-Glycoprotein (P-GP), Chemomodulatoren genannt, zeigten fÃ¼r den Fall solider Tumoren aufgrund nebenwirkungsbedingter EinschrÃ¤nkungen der erreichbaren Konzentrationen bisher noch keine klinischen Erfolge. Mit der Fragestellung, ob und wie weit Chemomodulatoren den P-Gpmediierten Zytostatikatransport in intestinalen Karzinomzellen hemmen, wurden neben dem AntiÃ¶strogen Tamoxifen (TMX) die speziell fÃ¼r die MDR-Reversion entwickelten Chemomodulatoren, nÃ¤mlich das weniger kardiotoxische R-Enantiomer von Verapamil (R-VPL) und das nichtimmunsuppressive Cyclosporin SDZ PSC-833 (PSC), in vitro getestet.MethodikUnter Verwendung von HCT-8 intestinalen Adenokarzinomzell-Monolayem untersuchten wir den P-Gp-mediierten, transmembranen, sekretorischen Transport von Vinblastin, einem P-Gp-Substrat, sowie den zellassoziierten Vinblastingehalt in An- oder Abwesenheit obengenannter Chemomodulatoren unter verschiedenen extrazellulÃ¤ren pH-(pHo-)Bedingungen, wie sie in soliden Tumoren vorkommen. ZusÃ¤tzlich fÃ¼hrten wir durchfluÃŸzytometrische Effluxmessungen mit dem P-Gp-Substrat Rhodamin 123 unter denselben extrazellulÃ¤ren Bedingungen durch. Das AusmaÃŸ der durch die Chemomodulatoren bedingten Resistenzreversion wurde anhand von ChemosensitivitÃ¤tsassays (Inkorporation von3H-Thymidin) mit HCT-8 Einzelzellsuspensionen gezeigt.ErgebnisseDie Modulatoren R-VPL, PSC und TMX inhibierten den transepithelialen VIN-Transport in einem AusmaÃŸ von bis zu 50,55 bzw. 30%, der zellassoziierte Vinblastingehalt war nach 5h im Vergleich zur Kontrolle 3,7-, 2,3- bzw. 1.7mal grÃ¶ÃŸer. Im Gegensatz zu PSC und TMX stellten wir bei Verwendung von R-VPL einen 32-bzw. 47%igen Verlust der modulierenden Wirkung bei extrazellulÃ¤rer AnsÃ¤uerung (pHo 7,0 bzw. 6,8) fest. Damit Ã¼bereinstimmende Ergebnisse erzielten wir auch bei den durchfluÃŸzytometrischen Studien unter gleichen extrazellulÃ¤ren Bedingungen. Die ChemosensitivitÃ¤tsassays ergaben einen 8-, 5.3- und 10,7fachen Anstieg der VIN-ToxizitÃ¤t durch R-VPL (10 Î¼M), PSC (100 ng/ml) bzw. TMX (10 Î¼M).SchluÃŸfolgerungenMit TMX konnte trotz schwacher P-Gp-Inhibition eine deutliche Resistenzreversion bewirkt werden, was darauf hindeutet, daÃŸ zusÃ¤tzliche Mechanismen an der Resistenz der Zellinie beteiligt sind, die durch TMX, unabhÃ¤ngig von P-Gp-Interaktionen, beeinfluÃŸbar sind. Der festgestellte Wirkungsverlust von R-VPL unter sauren Bedingungen kÃ¶nnte als ErklÃ¤rung der vorherrschend negativen Ergebnisse klinischer Studien mit Verapamil bei TrÃ¤gern solider Tumoren dienen. Sofern MDR wesentlich zum fehlenden Ansprechen solider Tumoren auf Chemotherapie beitrÃ¤gt, wÃ¼rden wir klinische Erfolge mit PSC erwarten, das sich bei geringer klinischer ToxizitÃ¤t durch ein hohes vom pHo weitgehend unabhÃ¤ngiges P-Gp-Inhibitions-potential auszeichnet.SummaryBackgroundMultidrug resistance (MDR) is known to be an important mechanism of chemoresistance especially in hematologic and presumably in solid malignoma. Inhibitors of MDR-mediating P-glycoprotein (P-Gp) called chemomodulators. however, did not cause significant reversal of resistance in clinical trials so far. Main problems consisted in achieving sufficient concentrations and adverse side effects of chemomodulators. We tested chemomodulators especially developed for MDR reversal, namely the less cardiotoxic R-enantiomer of verapamil (R-VPL) and the non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine SDZPSC-833 (PSC), and further the antiestrogen tamoxifen (TMX) with respect to the inhibition of P-Gp-mediated transport of cytostatics in polarized intestinal carcinoma cells in vitro.MethodsUsing the HCT-8 intestinal adenocarcinoma cell monolayer model we assessed P-Gp-mediated, transmembrane, secretory transport of vinblastine (3H-VIN), a P-Gp substrate, as well as the cell-associated VIN-content in presence/absence of above chemomodulators under different extracellular pH (pHo) conditions known to prevail in carcinoma. Additionally we performed flow cytometric efflux experiments with the P-Gp substrate rhodamine 123 under same extracellular conditions. Reversion of resistance due to chemomodulators is shown by chemosensitivity assays (incorporation of3H-thymidine) of HCT-8 suspension cells.ResultsCompared to controls R-VPL (10 Î¼M), PSC (100 ng/ml) and TMX (10 Î¼M) inhibited3H-VIN transport up to 50, 55 and 30%, respectively and cell associated drug content was increased about 3.7, 2.3 and 1.7 times, respectively. In contrast to PSC and TMX effect we observed a significant 32 and 47% loss of chemomodulating capacity of R-VPL at pHo 7.0 and 6.8 when compared with the inhibition at pHo 7.5. Corresponding results were gathered from flow cytometry. Chemosensitivity assays showed an 8-, 5.3- and 10.7-fold increase of VIN-cytotoxity due to R-VPL, PSC and TMX, respectively.ConclusionsTMX displayed high overall resistance reversion, despite of low specific inhibition of P-Gp-mediated fluxes indicating further resistance mechanisms in HCT-8 cells revertable by TMX independent of its interaction with P-Gp. Our results could serve possible explanation for the predominately negative results of clinical studies with verapamil as MDR revertant in patients with resistant solid tumors because of only partial P-Gp inhibition at clinically achievable concentrations and significant loss of efficacy under acidic pHo-conditions. Because of high and pHo-independent capacity of P-Gp-inhibition PSC seems to be the most suitable chemomodulator as far as MDR contributes to the overall unresponsiveness to chemotherapy in solid tumours.",2007,Acta Chirurgica Austriaca

cGAAM - An Algorithm for Simultaneous Feature Selection and Clustering,"In this paper the modified version of cGAAM (a genetic algorithm for feature selection for clustering) is introduced. As it can be shown, the algorithm is able to find significant subsets of features in data sets that differ in size and number of classes. The common feature of the sets that were used to test the cGAAM is that the examples are provided with class labels. Due to this, although the clustering process was performed without the class labels, the chosen feature sets could be compared with feature subsets returned by Lasso method in terms of classification accuracy. The most important observation from the results presented in the paper is that the classification accuracy obtained with feature subsets returned by cGAAM was not only comparable with accuracy obtained with feature subsets returned by Lasso but almost always was higher than 80% (ionsphere dataset) and 90% (humanactivity dataset).",2019,
Model order reduction techniques for power amplifier digital predistortion linearization,"To address the known trade-off between linearity and efficiency of the PA, several linearization techniques have been proposed in the literature. Among them, the most widespread technique is now digital predistortion (DPD) a technique that existing mathematical models that model the behavior of the PA is used, these models are composed of several terms each multiplied by a coefficient. Dealing with broadband signals (tens and hundreds of MHz), it implies an increase in the number of coefficients required in the behavioral model of DPD to compensate both nonlinear effects and memory of PAs. Increasing the number of coefficients has a negative impact on the identification of these, as it not only increases the computational complexity of the extraction (usually carried out by linear regression least squares (LS)), but can lead to problems overfitting and uncertainty. The model order reduction DPD has the dual effect of mitigating the computational complexity and improve the conditioning of the matrix of regressors. The strategy used to reduce the model order PAs, is based partly on regularization techniques such as regression Ridge or Tikhonov, and the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression. Other techniques will be based on OMP (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit) combined with BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion). Present a study of the amplifier and some behavioral models PAs, then some of the existing linearization techniques, to stop focusing on DPD. Then we will focus on the reduction techniques PA behavioral model and experimental to finish making a comparison of all results.",2016,
Ergebnisvergleich von multimorbiden gefÃ¤ÃŸchirurgischen Patienten mit und ohne Majoramputation in einer deutschen stationÃ¤ren geriatrischen Rehabilitationsklinik,"ZusammenfassungHintergrundIm Zuge der demografischen Entwicklung wird mit einem Anstieg gefÃ¤ÃŸchirurgischer Eingriffe inklusive Majoramputationen bei hochbetagten multimorbiden geriatrischen Patienten gerechnet. Aufgrund der erheblichen VulnerabilitÃ¤t dieser Patienten erscheint das Angebot einer stationÃ¤ren geriatrischen Rehabilitation im direkten Anschluss an die akutstationÃ¤re Behandlung sinnvoll. Bisher wurde in Deutschland dieses Thema kaum untersucht.Material und MethodenAlle vom 01.06.2012 bis 31.12.2013 in unserer Klinik aufgenommenen Patienten mit gefÃ¤ÃŸchirurgischer Operation wurden in die retrospektive Analyse einbezogen. Dabei wurde das geriatrische Aufnahme- und Entlassassessment berÃ¼cksichtigt und eine Unterteilung in majoramputierte und nicht majoramputierte Rehabilitanden vorgenommen. Beide Gruppen wurden hinsichtlich der Entwicklung funktioneller Parameter und der AlltagsaktivitÃ¤t im Verlauf der Rehabilitation sowie des Entlassortes miteinander verglichen.Ergebnisse30 major- und 77 nicht majoramputierte Rehabilitanden konnten ausgewertet werden. Alle lebten zuvor in hÃ¤uslicher Umgebung. Das mediane Lebensalter lag bei 78,3Â Jahren. Im Verlauf der Rehabilitation zeigten sich in beiden Gruppen hochsignifikante Verbesserungen im Bereich der AlltagsfÃ¤higkeiten (Barthel), der Gehstrecke, des Timed-up-and-go-Tests und des Treppensteigens, wÃ¤hrend die nicht majoramputierten die majoramputierten Rehabilitanden in den meisten MobilitÃ¤tsassessments Ã¼bertrafen, vor allem im Five-chair-rising-Test. Die mittlere Verweildauer lag bei den major- bzw. nicht majoramputierten Rehabilitanden bei 41,8 vs. 23,9Â Tagen. Der Entlassort unterschied sich in beiden Gruppen nicht und lag zu Ã¼ber 90â€‰â€‰% in der hÃ¤uslichen Umgebung.SchlussfolgerungDie Daten der retrospektiven Untersuchung zeigen, dass auch hochaltrige multimorbide Patienten nach gefÃ¤ÃŸchirurgischer Intervention von der stationÃ¤ren geriatrischen Rehabilitationsbehandlung profitieren. Dabei werden von majoramputierten Rehabilitanden geringere, jedoch im Vergleich zum Ausgangswert hochsignifikante Verbesserungen in der MobilitÃ¤t und AlltagsfÃ¤higkeit in einer adÃ¤quaten Verweildauer erreicht. Damit ist fÃ¼r eine groÃŸe Mehrheit der Rehabilitanden die weitere Versorgung in der hÃ¤uslichen Umgebung mÃ¶glich.AbstractBackgroundIn the course of demographic developments, an increase of vascular surgical procedures including major amputations in very elderly, multimorbid geriatric patients is expected. Due to the high vulnerability of these patients, geriatric rehabilitation directly following the acute inpatient treatment is likely to improve the abilities of these patients. This issue is not well analyzed in Germany up to now.Materials and methodsThis retrospective study includes all patients who were admitted to our clinic for geriatric rehabilitation after vascular surgery between 01Â JuneÂ 2012 and 31Â DecemberÂ 2013. Geriatric assessments at the time of admission and discharge were considered. The group was divided into rehabilitation patients with major limb amputation and nonmajor limb amputation. Both groups were analyzed with respect to functional parameters and activities in daily life (ADL) during the course of rehabilitation as well as the discharge location (home versus nursing home).ResultsA total of 30Â major-limb-amputee and 77Â nonmajor-limb-amputee rehabilitants could be analyzed. Before surgical intervention, 100â€‰â€‰% of patients lived in a home care situation. The median age was 78.3Â years. During rehabilitation, both groups showed highly significant improvements in ADL (Barthel index), Timed Up and Go test, walking distance, and stair climbing; however the nonmajor amputees surpassed the major amputees in most mobility assessments especially in the five chair-rising test. The rehabilitation time (median) was 41.8Â days for major and 23.9Â days for nonmajor amputees. More than 90â€‰â€‰% of the rehabilitants in both groups could be discharged home.ConclusionThe data from this retrospective study indicate that even advanced old age, multimorbid patients benefit from geriatric rehabilitation after vascular surgery intervention. Although less distinct than the group of minor amputee rehabilitants, highly significant improvements were also demonstrated in the group of major amputee rehabilitants as assessed in the discharge mobility and ADL results compared to the admission assessment results. These improvements were achieved in an adequate time period and led to discharge into home care for the majority of patients.",2014,Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Gerontologie und Geriatrie

A Lasso-OLS Hybrid Approach to Covariate Selection and Average Treatment Effect Estimation for Clustered RCTs Using Design-Based Methods,"Statistical power is often a concern for clustered RCTs due to variance inflation from design effects and the high cost of adding study clusters (such as hospitals, schools, or communities). While covariate pre-specification is the preferred approach for improving power to estimate regressionadjusted average treatment effects (ATEs), further precision gains can be achieved through covariate selection once primary outcomes have been collected. This article uses design-based methods underlying clustered RCTs to develop a Lasso-OLS hybrid procedure for the post-hoc selection of covariates and ATE estimation that avoids model overfitting and lack of transparency. In the first stage, lasso estimation is conducted using cluster-level averages, where asymptotic normality is proved using a new central limit theorem for finite population regression estimators. In the second stage, ATEs and design-based standard errors are estimated using weighted least squares with the first stage lasso covariates. This nonparametric approach applies to continuous, binary, and discrete outcomes. Simulation results indicate that Type 1 errors of the second stage ATE estimates are near nominal values and standard errors are near true ones, although somewhat conservative with small samples. The method is demonstrated using data from a large, federally funded clustered RCT testing the effects of school-based programs promoting behavioral health.",2020,
The lasso technique for posterior C1-C2 fusion.,"OBJECTIVE
Posterior atlantoaxial arthrodesis requires placement of a bone graft in a properly prepared environment that includes decorticated bony surfaces, compressive forces between graft and native bone, and limited motion. To achieve posterior atlantoaxial arthrodesis, various cable-and-graft constructs have been used, all of which require an intact posterior arch of C1. For patients who lack an intact arch owing to congenital, iatrogenic, or traumatic causes, we have devised the ""lasso technique,"" which uses the remnants of the posterior arch of C1 for placement of the graft to achieve fusion isolated to C1-C2 or to be part of an occipitocervical construct.


METHODS
A retrospective record review was conducted of all patients who underwent the lasso technique. Clinical and radiographic history, perioperative course, and time to fusion were recorded. We describe the technique in detail.


RESULTS
During the last 13 years, we have used this technique successfully in five female and four male patients. The absent or incompetent posterior arch was a congenital defect in one patient, a result of prior surgical removal in four patients, and caused by fracture associated with prior failed fusion attempts in four other patients. All patients experienced successful fusion after an average of 6.8 months.


CONCLUSION
Securing a bone graft in the absence of an intact C1 lamina is a challenge when a patient presents with atlantoaxial instability. We have devised the lasso technique to secure an interpositional C1-C2 graft using the remnants of the posterior atlantal arch. Although this technique has been required relatively infrequently, we have found it to be valuable and effective in our practice.",2007,Neurosurgery
Bacteriocins of Non-aureus Staphylococci Isolated from Bovine Milk.,"Non-aureus staphylococci (NAS), the bacteria most commonly isolated from the bovine udder, potentially protect the udder against infection by major mastitis pathogens due to bacteriocin production. In this study, we determined the inhibitory capability of 441 bovine NAS isolates (comprising 26 species) against bovine Staphylococcus aureus Furthermore, inhibiting isolates were tested against a human methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolate using a cross-streaking method. We determined the presence of bacteriocin clusters in NAS whole genomes using genome mining tools, BLAST, and comparison of genomes of closely related inhibiting and noninhibiting isolates and determined the genetic organization of any identified bacteriocin biosynthetic gene clusters. Forty isolates from 9 species (S. capitis, S. chromogenes, S. epidermidis, S. pasteuri, S. saprophyticus, S. sciuri, S. simulans, S. warneri, and S. xylosus) inhibited growth of S. aureus in vitro, 23 isolates of which, from S. capitis, S. chromogenes, S. epidermidis, S. pasteuri, S. simulans, and S. xylosus, also inhibited MRSA. One hundred five putative bacteriocin gene clusters encompassing 6 different classes (lanthipeptides, sactipeptides, lasso peptides, class IIa, class IIc, and class IId) in 95 whole genomes from 16 species were identified. A total of 25 novel bacteriocin precursors were described. In conclusion, NAS from bovine mammary glands are a source of potential bacteriocins, with >21% being possible producers, representing potential for future characterization and prospective clinical applications.IMPORTANCE Mastitis (particularly infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus) costs Canadian dairy producers $400 million/year and is the leading cause of antibiotic use on dairy farms. With increasing antibiotic resistance and regulations regarding use, there is impetus to explore bacteriocins (bacterially produced antimicrobial peptides) for treatment and prevention of bacterial infections. We examined the ability of 441 NAS bacteria from Canadian bovine milk samples to inhibit growth of S. aureus in the laboratory. Overall, 9% inhibited growth of S. aureus and 58% of those also inhibited MRSA. In NAS whole-genome sequences, we identified >21% of NAS as having bacteriocin genes. Our study represents a foundation to further explore NAS bacteriocins for clinical use.",2017,Applied and environmental microbiology
The combined influence of grain size distribution and dislocation density on hardness of interstitial free steel,"Abstract Understanding the relationship between microstructure features and mechanical properties is of great significance for the improvement and specific adjustment of steel properties. The relationship between mean grain size and yield strength is established by the well-known Hall-Petch equation. But due to the complexity of the grain configuration within materials, considering only the mean value is unlikely to give a complete representation of the mechanical behavior. The classical Taylor equation is often used to account for the effect of dislocation density, but not thoroughly tested in combination with grain size influence. In the present study, systematic heat treatment routes and cold rolling followed by annealing are designed for interstitial free (IF) steel to achieve ferritic microstructures that not only vary in mean grain size, but also in grain size distribution and in dislocation density, a combination that is rarely studied in the literature. Optical microscopy is applied to determine the grain size distribution. The dislocation density is determined through XRD measurements. The hardness is analyzed on its relation with the mean grain size, as well as with the grain size distribution and the dislocation density. With the help of the variable selection tool LASSO, it is shown that dislocation density, mean grain size and kurtosis of grain size distribution are the three features which most strongly affect hardness of IF steel.",2020,Journal of Materials Science & Technology
Unbalance identification using the least angle regression technique,"Abstract The present investigation proposes a robust procedure for unbalance identification using the equivalent load method based on sparse vibration measurements. The procedure is demonstrated and benchmarked on an example rotor at constant speed. Since the number of measuring positions is much smaller than the number of possible fault locations, performing unbalance identification leads to an ill-posed problem. This problem was tried to be overcome previously with modal expansion in the time domain and with several linear regressions in the frequency domain. However, since the solution to the problem is a sparse equivalent force vector, these methods cannot provide a robust identification procedure. A robust identification can only be achieved by providing a-priori information on the number of unbalances to be identified. The presently proposed procedure achieves more precise unbalance identification without the need of a-priori information by incorporating a regularization technique. A well-known technique for producing sparse solutions is the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The proposed procedure is based on the generalized technique Least Angle Regression (LAR) which finds all the solutions of LASSO. A comparison of the time-domain approach, the frequency-domain approach and the proposed technique is made and the superiority of the latter technique in identifying the number of possible fault locations is highlighted. The selection of the threshold of the convergence algorithm of LAR as well as the selection of the value of the Lagrangian multiplier is discussed in some detail.",2015,Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing
Identification of gene expression-based prognostic markers in the hematopoietic stem cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.,"PURPOSE
The diagnosis of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is largely dependent on morphologic examination of bone marrow aspirates. Several criteria that form the basis of the classifications and scoring systems most commonly used in clinical practice are affected by operator-dependent variation. To identify standardized molecular markers that would allow prediction of prognosis, we have used gene expression profiling (GEP) data on CD34+ cells from patients with MDS to determine the relationship between gene expression levels and prognosis.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
GEP data on CD34+ cells from 125 patients with MDS with a minimum 12-month follow-up since date of bone marrow sample collection were included in this study. Supervised principal components and lasso penalized Cox proportional hazards regression (Coxnet) were used for the analysis.


RESULTS
We identified several genes, the expression of which was significantly associated with survival of patients with MDS, including LEF1, CDH1, WT1, and MN1. The Coxnet predictor, based on expression data on 20 genes, outperformed other predictors, including one that additionally used clinical information. Our Coxnet gene signature based on CD34+ cells significantly identified a separation of patients with good or bad prognosis in an independent GEP data set based on unsorted bone marrow mononuclear cells, demonstrating that our signature is robust and may be applicable to bone marrow cells without the need to isolate CD34+ cells.


CONCLUSION
We present a new, valuable GEP-based signature for assessing prognosis in MDS. GEP-based signatures correlating with clinical outcome may significantly contribute to a refined risk classification of MDS.",2013,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology

Predicting Yield Performance of Parents in Plant Breeding: A Neural Collaborative Filtering Approach,"Experimental corn hybrids are created in plant breeding programs by crossing two parents, so-called inbred and tester, together. Identification of best parent combinations for crossing is challenging since the total number of possible cross combinations of parents is large and it is impractical to test all possible cross combinations due to limited resources of time and budget. In the 2020 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the historical yield performances of around 4% of total cross combinations of 593 inbreds with 496 testers which were planted in 280 locations between 2016 and 2018 and asked participants to predict the yield performance of cross combinations of inbreds and testers that have not been planted based on the historical yield data collected from crossing other inbreds and testers. In this paper, we present a collaborative filtering method which is an ensemble of matrix factorization method and neural networks to solve this problem. Our computational results suggested that the proposed model significantly outperformed other models such as LASSO, random forest (RF), and neural networks. Presented method and results were produced within the 2020 Syngenta Crop Challenge.",2020,ArXiv
"Halophilic Aspergillus penicillioides from athalassohaline, thalassohaline, and polyhaline environments","Aspergillus penicillioides is a true halophile, present in diverse econiches - from the hypersaline athalassohaline, and thalassohaline environments, to polyhaline systems, and in different geographical locations. Twenty seven isolates from these environments, were seen to be moderate halophiles, euryhaline in nature. They had an obligate need of a low aw and were unable to grow on a regular defined medium such as Czapek Dox Agar, as well as on varied nutrient rich agar media such as Malt Extract, Potato Dextrose and Sabouraud Agar; however, growth was obtained on all these media when amended with 10% solar salt. In absence of added salt, the conidia either did not germinate, or when germinated, distortions and lysis were seen in the short mycelial forms; on media with salt, the mycelia and vesicles appeared normal.",2014,Frontiers in Microbiology
Asymptotically Exact Error Analysis for the Generalized $\ell_2^2$-LASSO,"Given an unknown signal $\mathbf{x}_0\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and linear noisy measurements $\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0+\sigma\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{R}^m$, the generalized $\ell_2^2$-LASSO solves $\hat{\mathbf{x}}:=\arg\min_{\mathbf{x}}\frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2 + \sigma\lambda f(\mathbf{x})$. Here, $f$ is a convex regularization function (e.g. $\ell_1$-norm, nuclear-norm) aiming to promote the structure of $\mathbf{x}_0$ (e.g. sparse, low-rank), and, $\lambda\geq 0$ is the regularizer parameter. A related optimization problem, though not as popular or well-known, is often referred to as the generalized $\ell_2$-LASSO and takes the form $\hat{\mathbf{x}}:=\arg\min_{\mathbf{x}}\|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\|_2 + \lambda f(\mathbf{x})$, and has been analyzed in [1]. [1] further made conjectures about the performance of the generalized $\ell_2^2$-LASSO. This paper establishes these conjectures rigorously. We measure performance with the normalized squared error $\mathrm{NSE}(\sigma):=\|\hat{\mathbf{x}}-\mathbf{x}_0\|_2^2/\sigma^2$. Assuming the entries of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ be i.i.d. standard normal, we precisely characterize the ""asymptotic NSE"" $\mathrm{aNSE}:=\lim_{\sigma\rightarrow 0}\mathrm{NSE}(\sigma)$ when the problem dimensions $m,n$ tend to infinity in a proportional manner. The role of $\lambda,f$ and $\mathbf{x}_0$ is explicitly captured in the derived expression via means of a single geometric quantity, the Gaussian distance to the subdifferential. We conjecture that $\mathrm{aNSE} = \sup_{\sigma>0}\mathrm{NSE}(\sigma)$. We include detailed discussions on the interpretation of our result, make connections to relevant literature and perform computational experiments that validate our theoretical findings.",2015,arXiv: Statistics Theory
A fast and efficient smoothing approach to LASSO regression and an application in statistical genetics: polygenic risk scores for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"We consider solving a high dimensional linear regression problem, using LASSO to account for sparsity. Though the LASSO objective function is convex, it is not differentiable everywhere, making the use of gradient descent methods for minimization not straightforward. To avoid this technical issue, we suggest to use Nesterov smoothing of the LASSO objective function which enables us to compute closed form derivatives for efficient and fast minimization. The contribution of this work is threefold: (1) We propose an algorithm to efficiently compute estimates of the LASSO regression parameters; (2) we prove explicit bounds on the accuracy of the obtained estimates which show that the estimates obtained through the smoothed problem can be made arbitrary close to the ones of the original (unsmoothed) LASSO problem; (3) we propose an iterative procedure of the proposed approach to progressively smooth the objective function, which facilitates minimization and increases accuracy. Using simulation studies for polygenic risk scores based on genetic data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for COPD, we evaluate accuracy and runtime of the proposed approaches and compare them with the current standard in the literature. The results of the simulation studies suggest that the proposed methodology, progressive smoothing, provides estimates with higher accuracy than standard approaches that rely on GLMNET and that the differences are of practical relevance, while the computation time for progressive smoothing increases only be a constant factor, compared to GLMNET.",2020,bioRxiv
From Linguistic Patterns to Ontology Structures,"The aim of this paper is to contribute to the research on linguistic patterns focusing on the subclassOf relation for the semi-automatic construction of ontologies. Taking as a starting point those ontological structures corresponding to consensual modelling solutions, which are known as Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs), we identified the linguistic patterns that convey the relation captured in ODPs as Lexico-Syntactic Patterns (LSPs) and included them in an LSP-ODP pattern repository. LSPs will permit novice users the conversion of the domain field they want to model into an ontological structure. In the present contribution, the language of classification in Spanish is studied in order to collect the most common ways of verbally expressing the subclassOf relation. Then, the topology of the most common classification patterns is analysed to discover the type of ontological knowledge provided, i.e. which concept relation, and the two essential features in ontology knowledge: exhaustiveness and disjointness.",2009,
Five key lncRNAs considered as prognostic targets for predicting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis, and the 5-year survival rate was only 7.7%. To improve prognosis, a screening biomarker for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is in urgent need. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles as potential cancer prognostic biomarkers play critical roles in development of tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancer. However, lncRNA signatures in predicting the survival of a patient with PDAC remain unknown. In the current study, we try to identify potential lncRNA biomarkers and their prognostic values in PDAC. LncRNAs expression profiles and corresponding clinical information for 182 cases with PDAC were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A total of 14â€‰470 lncRNA were identified in the cohort, and 175 PDAC patients had clinical variables. We obtained 108 differential expressed lncRNA via R packages. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, lasso regression was performed to screen the potential prognostic lncRNA. Five lncRNAs have been recognized to significantly correlate with OS. We established a linear prognostic model of five lncRNA (C9orf139, MIR600HG, RP5-965G21.4, RP11-436K8.1, and CTC-327F10.4) and divided patients into high- and low-risk group according to the prognostic index. The five lncRNAs played independent prognostic biomarkers of OS of PDAC patients and the AUC of the ROC curve for the five lncRNAs signatures prediction 5-year survival was 0.742. In addition, targeted genes of MIR600HG, C9orf139, and CTC-327F10.4 were explored and functional enrichment was also conducted. These results suggested that this five-lncRNAs signature could act as potential prognostic biomarkers in the prediction of PDAC patient's survival.",2018,Journal of Cellular Biochemistry
Covariance matrix selection and estimation via penalised normal likelihood,"We propose a nonparametric method for identifying parsimony and for producing a statistically efficient estimator of a large covariance matrix. We reparameterise a covariance matrix through the modified Cholesky decomposition of its inverse or the one-step-ahead predictive representation of the vector of responses and reduce the nonintuitive task of modelling covariance matrices to the familiar task of model selection and estimation for a sequence of regression models. The Cholesky factor containing these regression coefficients is likely to have many off-diagonal elements that are zero or close to zero. Penalised normal likelihoods in this situation with L-sub-1 and L-sub-2 penalities are shown to be closely related to Tibshirani's (1996) LASSO approach and to ridge regression. Adding either penalty to the likelihood helps to produce more stable estimators by introducing shrinkage to the elements in the Cholesky factor, while, because of its singularity, the L-sub-1 penalty will set some elements to zero and produce interpretable models. An algorithm is developed for computing the estimator and selecting the tuning parameter. The proposed maximum penalised likelihood estimator is illustrated using simulation and a real dataset involving estimation of a 102 Ã— 102 covariance matrix.

Genomic Prediction of Quantitative Traits using Sparse and Locally Epistatic Models,"In plant and animal breeding studies a distinction is made between the genetic value (additive + epistatic genetic effects) and the breeding value (additive genetic effects) of an individual since it is expected that some of the epistatic genetic effects will be lost due to recombination. In this paper, we argue that the breeder can take advantage of some of the epistatic marker effects in regions of low recombination. The models introduced here aim to estimate local epistatic line heritability by using the genetic map information and combine the local additive and epistatic effects. To this end, we have used semi-parametric mixed models with multiple local genomic relationship matrices with hierarchical designs and lasso post-processing for sparsity in the final model. Our models produce good predictive performance along with good explanatory information.",2014,arXiv: Applications
Multi-static passive SAR imaging based on Bayesian compressive sensing,"Passive radar systems, which utilize broadcast and navigation signals as sources of opportunity, have attracted significant interests in recent years due to their low cost, covertness, and the availability of different illuminator sources. In this paper, we propose a novel method for synthetic aperture imaging in multi-static passive radar systems based on a group sparse Bayesian learning technique. In particular, the problem of imaging sparse targets is formulated as a group sparse signal reconstruction problem, which is solved using a complex multi- task Bayesian compressive sensing (CMT-BCS) method to achieve a high resolution. The proposed approach significantly improves the imaging resolution beyond the range resolution. Compared to the other group sparse signal reconstruction methods, such as the block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) and group Lasso, the CMT-BCS provides significant performance improvement for the reconstruction of sparse targets in the redundant dictionary with high coherence. Simulations results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.",2014,
The steinheim basin as a paleo - ancient lake,"The convergent evolution of â€œthalassoidâ€ planorbid gastropod shells suggests that the Miocene impact-crater lake of Steinheim (S. Germany) is a fossil example of an Ancient Lake (i.e., a â€œPaleo-ancient Lakeâ€), comparable to the modern Lake Ochrid (Yugoslavia). In these and other cases it was probably the long-term stability of such environments that allowed an unusual degree of evolutionary diversification and ennichement of resident species. Ecological close-packing, rather than a hydrochemical barrier, is suggested to eventually stop the faunal exchange of such ancient lakes with adjacent, less stable fresh water biotopes.",1985,
Is the Age-Related Decline in Renal Function an Age-Associated Disease or Part of a Normal Aging Process?,"years, these observations initiated an ongoing discussion as to what extent the current KDIGO guidelines, which do not include the patientsâ€™ age in their risk stratification, are applicable to a population of advanced age, in particular >70 years, or if the current guidelines lead to a gross overestimation of the prevalence of CKD in the older population. In other words â€“ is the age-related decline in renal function an age-associated disease or part of a normal aging process? An often cited argument against an age-related stratification of CKD is the wide-spread sorrow of potential drug-related side effects if dosages are not adapted according to eGFR or even CKD staging. This concern was already addressed by Dettli [5] in his landmark paper on drugrelated renal clearance. Even for medications with almost exclusive renal clearance, side effects rarely occur in patients with an eGFR >45 mL/min/m 3 [5] . Others argue that an age calibration would be too complicated [6] and rather lead to â€œchronic renal confusionâ€ than change the medical treatment options of the patients [7] . In 2015, Richard Glassock and colleagues [8] presented compelling evidence for a lower risk of disease progression in patients older than 65 years of age and CKD G3 as compared to adults aged 65 years and younger. This finding is supported by a recently published meta-analysis including data from over 2 million patients reporting a relatively low prevalence of end-stage reRecently, KÃ¶nig et al. [1] have reported on the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in an older German population applying various formulas to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The authors further stratified the prevalence of chronic renal insufficiency based on the current KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines. One major finding of this interesting study is that the widely used CKD-EPI 2009 formula only detected 16.4% of potential cases with CKD stages G3â€“G5 (i.e., eGFR <60 mL/ min/1.73 m 2 ), while the recently published FAS equation (full age spectrum equation; Pottel et al. [2] ) identified 25.4% of the study population as suffering from CKD. Moreover, a subset of patients (94; 5.7%) presented with albuminuria without pathological GFR impairment (eGFR >60 mL/ min/1.73 m 2 , albuminuria >30 mg/g creatinine). Especially in the latter group, the individuals studied were not aware of their renal condition underlining the importance of both eGFR measurements and the determination of albuminuria/proteinuria, to properly assess renal function. According to the authors and as depicted in their Supplementary Figure 2, 16.15% (263 patients) showed a moderate risk for disease progression due to an eGFR between 45 and 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the absence of albuminuria. In fact, if applied to the general public, the KDIGO classification yields a prevalence of up to 50% in patients aged 70 years and older [3, 4] .

"Lithiase du haut appareil urinaire au Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sanou Souro de Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso): Aspects Ã©pidÃ©miologiques, cliniques et thÃ©rapeutiques: A propos de 110","Objectif : Etudier les aspects epidemiologiques, cliniques et therapeutiques de la lithiase du haut appareil urinaire dans notre service. 
Methodes : Etude retrospective allant du 1er janvier 1993 au 31 Decembre 2002 basee sur les dossiers des patients, les registres de protocoles operatoires et d'hospita-lisation. 
Resultats : En 10 ans, 110 cas de lithiases du haut appareil urinaire ont ete pris en charge dans notre service sur un total de 7128 patients hospitalises soit en moyenne 11 cas par an ou une prevalence hospitaliere de 1,54%. L'Ã¢ge moyen des patients etait 35,49 ans (extremes un et 75 ans). Une predominance masculine nette a ete notee: 7 hommes pour une femme. La manifesta-tion clinique predominante etait la colique nephretique suivie des douleurs lombaires d'autres types. Le traitement etait base sur la chirurgie ouverte (108 cas sur 109 operes par la chirurgie conventionnelle). Les suites operatoires ont ete simples avec une duree de sejour hospitalier moyenne de 13,5 jours. 
Conclusion : La lithiase du haut appareil urinaire est peu frequente dans notre region, mais elle semble en constante progression. Nous sommes encore dans l'obligation de recourir la plupart du temps a la chirurgie ouverte pour les traiter, alors que cette methode ne constitue plus la reference en matiere du traitement de la lithiase urinaire. Upper Urinary Tract Calculi at the Sanou Souro Teaching Hospital of Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). Epidemiological, Clinical and Therapeutic Aspects Studied in 110 Cases 
Objective: To study the epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of upper urinary tract lithiasis at our department. 
Material and Methods: This is a retrospective study based on the patients\' records and covering the period from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2002. 
Results: During a period of 10 years, 110 cases of upper urinary tract calculi out of a total number of 7128 hospitalized patients were seen at our institution, thus constituting 1,54% of all hospital admissions. The patients\' mean age was 35,49 years (range: one to 75 years), the male to female ratio was 7:1. The main presenting symptom was renal colic followed by lower back pain. Treatment was mainly by open surgery (108 of 109 cases were managed by conventional surgery). Follow-up was uneventful in all cases with a mean hospital stay of 13,5 days. 
Conclusion: Upper urinary tract lithiasis is rarely encountered in our region, but it seems to be in constant progression. We are still obliged to resort to open surgery in most cases, although this method is not the treatment of choice in developed countries any more.

Parameter Instability Regimes in Sparse Proximal Denoising Programs,"Compressed sensing theory explains why LASSO programs recover structured high-dimensional signals with minimax order-optimal error. Yet, the optimal choice of the programâ€™s governing parameter is often unknown in practice. It is still unclear how variation of the governing parameter impacts recovery error in compressed sensing, which is otherwise provably stable and robust. We establish a novel notion of instability in LASSO programs when the measurement matrix is identity. This is the proximal denoising setup. We prove asymptotic cusp-like behaviour of the risk as a function of the parameter choice, and illustrate the theory with numerical simulations. For example, a 0.1% underestimate of a LASSO parameter can increase the error significantly; and a 50% underestimate can cause the error to increase by a factor of 109. We hope that revealing parameter instability regimes of LASSO programs helps to inform a practitionerâ€™s choice.",2019,2019 13th International conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)
How Hard Is Finding Shortest Counter-Example Lassos in Model Checking?,"Modern model checkers help system engineers to pinpoint the reason for the faulty behavior of a system by providing counter-example traces. For finite-state systems and \(\omega \)-regular specifications, they come in the form of lassos. Lassos that are unnecessarily long should be avoided, as they make finding the cause for an error in a trace harder.",2019,
False Discoveries Occur Early on the Lasso Path,"In regression settings where explanatory variables have very low correlations and there are relatively few effects, each of large magnitude, we expect the Lasso to find the important variables with few errors, if any. This paper shows that in a regime of linear sparsity---meaning that the fraction of variables with a non-vanishing effect tends to a constant, however small---this cannot really be the case, even when the design variables are stochastically independent. We demonstrate that true features and null features are always interspersed on the Lasso path, and that this phenomenon occurs no matter how strong the effect sizes are. We derive a sharp asymptotic trade-off between false and true positive rates or, equivalently, between measures of type I and type II errors along the Lasso path. This trade-off states that if we ever want to achieve a type II error (false negative rate) under a critical value, then anywhere on the Lasso path the type I error (false positive rate) will need to exceed a given threshold so that we can never have both errors at a low level at the same time. Our analysis uses tools from approximate message passing (AMP) theory as well as novel elements to deal with a possibly adaptive selection of the Lasso regularizing parameter.",2015,ArXiv
A Deep Learning Approach for Heating and Cooling Equipment Monitoring,"Condition monitoring is an important issue in system health management, and usually the first step leading to fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis. It is often conducted through monitoring the time series of sensors, which usually includes outliers and change points. We adopt a deep learning model LSTM for monitoring the condition of boilers and chillers in a central heating and cooling plant. A two stage approach for condition monitoring is used: condition prediction and anomaly detection. In condition prediction stage, we use a LSTM model and three regression models: LASSO, SVR, and MLP to predict the energy efficiency of boilers and chillers. The experiments show that LSTM is able to establish a robust normal behavior of multiple boilers and chillers. LSTM reaches a lower prediction error than that of other three models in six out of nine boilers and chillers. In anomaly detection stage, we detect outliers or change points using the prediction errors from the LSTM model earlier than other models. This deep learning approach is applicable for real-time condition monitoring.",2019,2019 IEEE 15th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)
3D resistivity anomaly probability tomography at the archaeological site of Sagalassos (Turkey),"The archaeological site of Sagalassos is a very important settlement located in a magnificent mountain landscape, 7 km north from a little village named AÄŸlasun (province of Burdur, SW Turkey). Since 1990 the University of Leuven (Belgium) carry out an interdisciplinary archaeological research programme that study the uninterrupted occupation of more than 1000 years in all its aspects from daily life to architecture, from trade and its mechanisms to environmental conditions of the past. The ancient roman city is a site covered under erosion layers and preserved many secrets that need to be revealed. A geophysical campaign was planned along the south facing terraces of the mountain slopes, in order to f highlighting the structure of the city still covered. Site conditions (high slope, high grass, several obstacles) and the need to investigate high depths led to the choice of the most suitable geophysical methods. Particularly a 3D distribution in the subsoil of resistivity tensor probability was esteemed.",2018,
Sparsity Based Regularization,"In previous lectures, we saw how regularization can be used to restore the well-posedness of the empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem. We also derived algorithms that use regularization to impose smoothness assumptions on the solution space (as in the case of Tikhonov regularization) or introduce additional structure by confining the solution space to low dimensional manifolds (manifold regularization). In this lecture, we will examine the use of regularization for the achievement of an alternative objective, namely sparsity. During the last ten years, there has been an increased interest in the general field of sparsity. Such interest comes not only from the Machine Learning community, but also from other scientific areas. For example, in Signal Processing sparsity is examined mainly in the context of compressive sensing [CRT06, Dono06] and the so called basis pursuit [CDS96]. In the Statistics literature, basis pursuit is known as the lasso [Tibs96]. Strong connections also exist with sparse coding [OlFi97] and independent component analysis [HyOj00]. In these notes, we discuss sparsity from a regularization point of view, and only refer to these connections as they arise from within this framework. Initially, we motivate the use of sparsity and emphasize on the problem of variable selection. Then, we present the formulation of the sparsity based regularization problem, develop tractable approximations to it, and justify them using a geometric interpretation of sparsity. Finally, after discussion of some of the properties of these approximations, we describe an algorithm for the solution of the sparsity based regularization problem.",2008,
"Polymorphisms in K13, pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, and pfdhps in parasites isolated from symptomatic malaria patients in Burkina Faso","BACKGROUND
The emergence of resistance to artemisinin derivatives in western Cambodia is threatening to revert the recent advances made toward global malaria control and elimination. Known resistance-mediating polymorphisms in the K13, pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, and pfdhps genes are of greatest importance for monitoring the spread of antimalarial drug resistance.


METHODS
Samples for the present study were collected from 244 patients with uncomplicated malaria in health centers of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Blood sample was collected on filter paper before the subject received any treatment. The parasite DNA was then extracted and amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to evaluate the prevalence of polymorphism of pfcrtK76T, pfmdr1 (N86Y, Y184F), and pfdhps (A437G, K540E). The K13 gene polymorphism was analyzed by nested PCR followed by sequencing.


RESULTS
The overall results showed 2.26% (5/221) of K13 synonymous mutant alleles (two C469C, one Y493Y, one G496G, and one V589V), 24.78%, 19.58%, 68.75%, 60.9%, 53.7%, 63.8%, and 64.28%, respectively, for mutant pfcrt 76T, pfmdr1-86Y, pfmdr1-184F, pfdhfr51I, pfdhfr59R, pfdhfr108N, and pfdhps 437G. We did not report any mutation at codon 540 of pfdhps.


CONCLUSION
These results provide baseline prevalence of known drug resistance polymorphisms and suggest that artemisinin combination therapies may retain good efficacy in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Burkina Faso.",2016,Parasite

[A large intraocular foreign body].,"INTRODUCTION
Penetrating wounds to the eyeball with penetration of a foreign body at the posterior segment are often extremely serious for the eye. The equipment available to extract them can sometimes be inadequate.


OBSERVATION
We report the case of a 38-year-old man hospitalized for a penetrating wound of the eyeball with a voluminous foreign body incarcerated in the retina. Because of the size of the foreign body it could not be extracted with the usual forceps. We describe the assembly put together during the intervention using an intramuscular needle and 7/0 virgin silk that allowed its extraction.


CONCLUSION
This lasso provides a very effective, easy and nontraumatic grasp of voluminous foreign bodies in the vitreal cavity.",2007,Journal francais d'ophtalmologie
Evaluation of disease resistance and tolerance to elevated temperature stress of the selected tissue-cultured Kappaphycus alvarezii Doty 1985 under optimized laboratory conditions,"Information on the abiotic stress tolerance and iceâ€“ice disease resistance properties of tissue-cultured Kappaphycus alvarezii is scarce and can pose a big hurdle to a wider use of tissue-cultured seaweed in the industry. Here, we reported on a study of seaweed-associated bacteria diversity in farmed and tissue-cultured K. alvarezii, and iceâ€“ice disease resistance and elevated growth temperature tolerance of tissue-cultured K. alvarezii in laboratory conditions. A total of 40 endophytic seaweed-associated bacteria strains were isolated from 4 types of K. alvarezii samples based on their colony morphologies, Gram staining properties and 16S rRNA gene sequences. Bacteria strains isolated were found to belong to Alteromonas sp., Aestuariibacter sp., Idiomarina sp., Jejuia sp., Halomonas sp., Primorskyibacter sp., Pseudoalteromonas sp., Ruegeria sp., Terasakiella sp., Thalassospira sp. and Vibrio sp. Vibrio alginolyticus strain ABI-TU15 isolated in this study showed agar-degrading property when analyzed using agar depression assay. Disease resistance assay was performed by infecting healthy K. alvarezii with 105Â cells/mL Vibrio sp. ABI-TU15. Severe iceâ€“ice disease symptoms were detected in farmed seaweeds compared to the tissue-cultured K. alvarezii. Besides disease resistance, tissue-cultured K. alvarezii showed better tolerance to the elevated growth temperatures of 30 and 35Â Â°C. In conclusion, our overall data suggests that tissue-cultured K. alvarezii exhibited better growth performance than farmed seaweeds when exposed to elevated growth temperature and iceâ€“ice disease-causing agent.",2018,3 Biotech
"Feature Selection with the R Package MXM: Discovering Multiple, Statistically-Equivalent, Predictive Feature Subsets","The statistically equivalent signature (SES) algorithm is a method for feature selection inspired by the principles of constrained-based learning of Bayesian Networks. Most of the currently available feature-selection methods return only a single subset of features, supposedly the one with the highest predictive power. We argue that in several domains multiple subsets can achieve close to maximal predictive accuracy, and that arbitrarily providing only one has several drawbacks. The SES method attempts to identify multiple, predictive feature subsets whose performances are statistically equivalent. Under that respect SES subsumes and extends previous feature selection algorithms, like the maxmin parent children algorithm. SES is implemented in an homonym function included in the R package MXM, standing for mens ex machina, meaning â€™mind from the machineâ€™ in Latin. The MXM implementation of SES handles several data-analysis tasks, namely classification, regression and survival analysis. In this paper we present the SES algorithm, its implementation, and provide examples of use of the SES function in R. Furthermore, we analyze three publicly available data sets to illustrate the equivalence of the signatures retrieved by SES and to contrast SES against the state-of-the-art feature selection method LASSO. Our results provide initial evidence that the two methods perform comparably well in terms of predictive accuracy and that multiple, equally predictive signatures are actually present in real world data.",2019,
Problematic internet use as an age-related multifaceted problem: Evidence from a two-site survey,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Problematic internet use (PIU; otherwise known as Internet Addiction) is a growing problem in modern societies. There is scarce knowledge of the demographic variables and specific internet activities associated with PIU and a limited understanding of how PIU should be conceptualized. Our aim was to identify specific internet activities associated with PIU and explore the moderating role of age and gender in those associations.


METHODS
We recruited 1749 participants aged 18 and above via media advertisements in an Internet-based survey at two sites, one in the US, and one in South Africa; we utilized Lasso regression for the analysis.


RESULTS
Specific internet activities were associated with higher problematic internet use scores, including general surfing (lasso Î²: 2.1), internet gaming (Î²: 0.6), online shopping (Î²: 1.4), use of online auction websites (Î²: 0.027), social networking (Î²: 0.46) and use of online pornography (Î²: 1.0). Age moderated the relationship between PIU and role-playing-games (Î²: 0.33), online gambling (Î²: 0.15), use of auction websites (Î²: 0.35) and streaming media (Î²: 0.35), with older age associated with higher levels of PIU. There was inconclusive evidence for gender and genderâ€¯Ã—â€¯internet activities being associated with problematic internet use scores. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and social anxiety disorder were associated with high PIU scores in young participants (ageâ€¯â‰¤â€¯25, Î²: 0.35 and 0.65 respectively), whereas generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were associated with high PIU scores in the older participants (ageâ€¯>â€¯55, Î²: 6.4 and 4.3 respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Many types of online behavior (e.g. shopping, pornography, general surfing) bear a stronger relationship with maladaptive use of the internet than gaming supporting the diagnostic classification of problematic internet use as a multifaceted disorder. Furthermore, internet activities and psychiatric diagnoses associated with problematic internet use vary with age, with public health implications.",2018,Addictive Behaviors
A Pass to Variable Selection,"Many regularized procedures produce sparse solution and therefore are sometimes used for variable selection in linear regression. It has been showed that regularized procedures are more stable than subset selection. Such procedures include LASSO, SCAD, and adaptive LASSO, to name just a few. However, their performance depends crucially on the tuning parameter selection. For the purpose of prediction, popular methods for the tuning parameter selection include Cp, cross-validation, and generalized cross-validation. For the purpose of variable selection, the most popular method for the tuning parameter selection is BIC. The selection consistency of BIC for some regularized procedures have been shown. However, knowing degrees of freedom is required in the use of BIC. For many regularized procedures, such as those for graphical models and clustering algorithms, the formulae for degrees of freedom do not exist.",2016,Journal of biometrics & biostatistics
"Automated, quantitative measures of grey and white matter lesion burden correlates with motor and cognitive function in children with unilateral cerebral palsy","White and grey matter lesions are the most prevalent type of injury observable in the Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) of children with cerebral palsy (CP). Previous studies investigating the impact of lesions in children with CP have been qualitative, limited by the lack of automated segmentation approaches in this setting. As a result, the quantitative relationship between lesion burden has yet to be established. In this study, we perform automatic lesion segmentation on a large cohort of data (107 children with unilateral CP and 18 healthy children) with a new, validated method for segmenting both white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) lesions. The method has better accuracy (94%) than the best current methods (73%), and only requires standard structural MRI sequences. Anatomical lesion burdens most predictive of clinical scores of motor, cognitive, visual and communicative function were identified using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection operator (LASSO). The improved segmentations enabled identification of significant correlations between regional lesion burden and clinical performance, which conform to known structure-function relationships. Model performance was validated in an independent test set, with significant correlations observed for both WM and GM regional lesion burden with motor function (pÂ <Â 0.008), and between WM and GM lesions alone with cognitive and visual function respectively (pÂ <Â 0.008). The significant correlation of GM lesions with functional outcome highlights the serious implications GM lesions, in addition to WM lesions, have for prognosis, and the utility of structural MRI alone for quantifying lesion burden and planning therapy interventions.",2016,NeuroImage : Clinical
Disease Definition for Schizophrenia by Functional Connectivity Using Radiomics Strategy,"Specific biomarker reflecting neurobiological substrates of schizophrenia (SZ) is required for its diagnosis and treatment selection of SZ. Evidence from neuroimaging has implicated disrupted functional connectivity in the pathophysiology. We aimed to develop and validate a method of disease definition for SZ by resting-state functional connectivity using radiomics strategy. This study included 2 data sets collected with different scanners. A total of 108 first-episode SZ patients and 121 healthy controls (HCs) participated in the current study, among which 80% patients and HCs (n = 183) and 20% (n = 46) were selected for training and testing in intra-data set validation and 1 of the 2 data sets was selected for training and the other for testing in inter-data set validation, respectively. Functional connectivity was calculated for both groups, features were selected by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method, and the clinical utility of its features and the generalizability of effects across samples were assessed using machine learning by training and validating multivariate classifiers in the independent samples. We found that the accuracy of intra-data set training was 87.09% for diagnosing SZ patients by applying functional connectivity features, with a validation in the independent replication data set (accuracy = 82.61%). The inter-data set validation further confirmed the disease definition by functional connectivity features (accuracy = 83.15% for training and 80.07% for testing). Our findings demonstrate a valid radiomics approach by functional connectivity to diagnose SZ, which is helpful to facilitate objective SZ individualized diagnosis using quantitative and specific functional connectivity biomarker.",2018,Schizophrenia Bulletin
Seq2Sick: Evaluating the Robustness of Sequence-to-Sequence Models with Adversarial Examples,"Crafting adversarial examples has become an important technique to evaluate the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, most existing works focus on attacking the image classification problem since its input space is continuous and output space is finite. 
In this paper, we study the much more challenging problem of crafting adversarial examples for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, whose inputs are discrete text strings and outputs have an almost infinite number of possibilities. To address the challenges caused by the discrete input space, we propose a projected gradient method combined with group lasso and gradient regularization. To handle the almost infinite output space, we design some novel loss functions to conduct non-overlapping attack and targeted keyword attack. We apply our algorithm to machine translation and text summarization tasks, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm: by changing less than 3 words, we can make seq2seq model to produce desired outputs with high success rates. On the other hand, we recognize that, compared with the well-evaluated CNN-based classifiers, seq2seq models are intrinsically more robust to adversarial attacks.",2018,ArXiv
Analysis of Bayesian LASSO Using High Dimensional Data,"The sparse models play an important role in the field of machine learning. It can dimensionality reduction and effectively solve the over-fitting problem in modeling. The Bayesian method forms a priori distribution by fusing different information to obtain high-quality statistical inference. This paper summarizes the representative sparse model LASSO and Bayesian theory-based model Bayesian LASSO, and discussed the relationship between the two models. Through numeric experiments, the effects of the two models on variable selection were compared, and the parameter estimation of Bayesian LASSO under different prior conditions is further analyzed. Results attained showed that the two models have good effects in the variable selection. When the number of samples is small, especially when the number of samples is much smaller than the number of features, the effect of Bayesian LASSO is more prominent. It is also possible to estimate the model parameters and calculate the Bayesian confidence interval for each regression coefficient at a certain level of confidence, which is more flexible and convenient.",2019,
"Trophic structure of free-living nematodes in the Saigon River, Vietnam","Sub-tidal free-living nematodes in 12 stations along the Saigon River were investigated in both dry and rainy seasons during 2014 and 2015. In total, 157 nematode genera were found to belong to 59 families, and 11 orders of two classes of Enoplea and Chromadorea were identified. The trophic structure of free-living nematode communities was analysed spanning the overall seasons to see that deposit-feeders developed dominantly in the Saigon River indicating their association with food types including particles, bacteria, diatom, etc.. The dominance of deposit-feeders was contributed to a high abundance of genera in each station, including Theristus, Teschellingia, Monhystera, Thalassomonhystera, Paraplectonema, Daptonema, Aphanonchus, Sphaerotheristus, and Geomonhystera. Epistrate-feeder types were found as the second most abundant group. The remaining feeding types, such as chewers and suction-feeders, were in rather low proportion at most stations.

The Mechanism of Regulated Release of Lasso/Teneurin-2,"Teneurins are large cell-surface receptors involved in axon guidance. Teneurin-2 (also known as latrophilin-1-associated synaptic surface organizer (Lasso)) interacts across the synaptic cleft with presynaptic latrophilin-1, an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor that participates in regulating neurotransmitter release. Lasso-latrophilin-1 interaction mediates synapse formation and calcium signaling, highlighting the important role of this trans-synaptic receptor pair. However, Lasso is thought to be proteolytically cleaved within its ectodomain and released into the medium, making it unclear whether it acts as a proper cell-surface receptor or a soluble protein. We demonstrate here that during its intracellular processing Lasso is constitutively cleaved at a furin site within its ectodomain. The cleaved fragment, which encompasses almost the entire ectodomain of Lasso, is potentially soluble; however, it remains anchored on the cell surface via its non-covalent interaction with the transmembrane fragment of Lasso. Lasso is also constitutively cleaved within the intracellular domain (ICD). Finally, Lasso can be further proteolytically cleaved within the transmembrane domain. The third cleavage is regulated and releases the entire ectodomain of Lasso into the medium. The released ectodomain of Lasso retains its functional properties and binds latrophilin-1 expressed on other cells; this binding stimulates intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in the target cells. Thus, Lasso not only serves as a bona fide cell-surface receptor, but also as a partially released target-derived signaling factor.",2016,Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience
Culture-independent analysis of bacterial communities in hemolymph of American lobsters with epizootic shell disease.,"Epizootic shell disease (ESD) of the American lobster Homarus americanus H. Milne Edwards, 1837 is a disease of the carapace that presents grossly as large, melanized, irregularly shaped lesions, making the lobsters virtually unmarketable because of their grotesque appearance. We analyzed the bacterial communities present in the hemolymph of lobsters with and without ESD using nested-PCR of the 16S rRNA genes followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. All lobsters tested (n = 42) had bacterial communities in their hemolymph, and the community profiles were highly similar regardless of the sampling location or disease state. A number of bacteria were detected in a high proportion of samples and from numerous locations, including a Sediminibacterium sp. closely related to a symbiont of Tetraponera ants (38/42) and a Ralstonia sp. (27/42). Other bacteria commonly encountered included various Bacteroidetes, Pelomonas aquatica, and a Novosphingobium sp. One bacterium, a different Sediminibacterium sp., was detected in 20% of diseased animals (n = 29), but not in the lobsters without signs of ESD (n = 13). The bacteria in hemolymph were not the same as those known to be present in lesion communities except for the detection of a Thalassobius sp. in 1 individual. This work demonstrates that hemolymph bacteremia and the particular bacterial species present do not correlate with the incidence of ESD, providing further evidence that microbiologically, ESD is a strictly cuticular disease. Furthermore, the high incidence of the same species of bacteria in hemolymph of lobsters may indicate that they have a positive role in lobster fitness, rather than in disease, and further investigation of the role of bacteria in lobster hemolymph is required.",2013,Diseases of aquatic organisms
Solving Lasso: Extended ADMM is more efficient than ADMM,"The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) has become very popular and attractive approach for regularization and variable selection for high-dimensional data in machine learning. In this paper, we present an extended alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving the Lasso. The extended ADMM is global convergent, and all the subproblems can easily get the solutions. It can also be implemented in distributed manner, which is beneficial for storage and computation requirement. Numerical experiments demonstrated that the extended ADMM outperforms other popular algorithms.",2015,2015 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)
Mining Prognostic Biomarkers of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Based on Immune-Associated Genes.,"This research aims to investigate the immune-associated gene signature from databases to improve the prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by multidimensional methods using various bioinformatic methods. Fifty-one immune-associated genes were mined out, which were associated with clinical characters through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, and 51 immune-associated genes could be well-divided HCC samples into high-risk and low-risk clusters. Next, we performed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression method to reveal 18 immune-associated genes' signature and calculate risk score of each gene for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Comparing with low-risk cluster, high-risk cluster had higher risk score with unfavorable prognosis. Then, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that risk score of 18 immune-associated genes' signature was associated with tumor invasion and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. ROC analysis indicated combined TNM stage, and risk score performed more sensitive and specific than single TNM stage or risk score in survival prediction. Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis found that the pathways enriched in tumorigenesis were related to risk score, and those pathways could separate HCC samples into high and low clusters. In addition, the survival prediction of 18 immune-associated genes' signature was well validated in independent test data set, external data set, and Real-time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiment. The 18 immune-associated genes' signature was constructed, which could be used in effective prediction of HCC prognosis.",2020,DNA and cell biology
Volatilome and micromorphological analysis of two rosemary hybrids,"Abstract The profile of volatile organic compounds (VOC), the composition of the essential oils (EOs) and the micromorphology of the leaf trichomes were investigated in two rosemary hybrids, SalviaÃ—mendizabalii (Sagredo ex Rosua) Roma-Marzio & Galasso (S Ã— m) and Salvia x lavandulacea (de Noe) Roma-Marzio & Galasso (S Ã— l). The phytochemical analysis highlighted the dominance of monoterpene hydrocarbons in both aroma profiles (65.8 % in S Ã— m and 77.9 % in S Ã— l, respectively), although they displayed different main compounds except for Î±-pinene (28.2 % in S Ã— m and 24.5 % in S Ã— l). In S Ã— m the EOs extracted from both fresh and dried leaves exhibited camphor (29.7 % and 25.9 %, respectively), Î±-pinene (21.0 % and 18.2 %, respectively) and 1,8-cineole (11.1 % and 13.6 %, respectively) as major compounds. Noteworthy is the occurrence of Î²-pinene (2.6 %) in the EO dried samples, whereas sabinene and limonene were exclusive of the fresh samples. In S Ã— l the EOs from the fresh and dried leaves shared the same main compounds: camphor (24.0 % and 27.5 %, respectively), myrcene (14.9 % and 14.8 %, respectively) and Î±-pinene (13.1 % and 12.2 %, respectively). The micro-morphological observations on leaves proved the occurrence of non-glandular dendritic hairs with smooth cuticle in both hybrids. The glandular trichomes include three main morphotypes: peltate, short capitate and medium-long capitate. The peltate and the short capitates are common to both hybrids, however in the peltate the number of the head secreting cells is different, eight in S Ã— m and sixteen in S Ã— l. The medium-long capitate occurs exclusively on the leaf adaxial side of S Ã— m.",2020,Scientia Horticulturae
Sparse Bayesian DOA Estimation Using Hierarchical Synthesis Lasso Priors for Off-Grid Signals,"Within the conventional sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework, only Gaussian scale mixtures have been adopted to model sparsity-inducing priors that guarantee the exact inverse recovery. In light of the relative scarcity of formal SBL tools in enforcing a proper sparsity profile of signal vectors, we explore the use of hierarchical synthesis lasso (HSL) priors for representing the same small subset of features among multiple responses. We outline a viable approximation to this particular choice of sparse prior, leading to tractable marginalization over all weights and hyperparameters. We then discuss how the statistical variables of the hierarchical Bayesian model can be estimated via an adaptive updating formula, and include a refined one dimensional searching procedure to extraordinarily improve the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation performance when take the off-grid DOAs into account. Using these modifications, we show that exploiting HSL priors are very helpful in encouraging sparseness. Numerical simulations also verify the superiority of the proposal in terms of convergence speed and root mean squared estimation error, as compared to the traditional and more recent sparse Bayesian algorithms.",2020,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Variable selection in discrete survival models including heterogeneity,"Several variable selection procedures are available for continuous time-to-event data. However, if time is measured in a discrete way and therefore many ties occur models for continuous time are inadequate. We propose penalized likelihood methods that perform efficient variable selection in discrete survival modeling with explicit modeling of the heterogeneity in the population. The method is based on a combination of ridge and lasso type penalties that are tailored to the case of discrete survival. The performance is studied in simulation studies and an application to the birth of the first child.",2017,Lifetime Data Analysis
Linear ablation of left atrium for the treatment of atrial fibrillation guided by double Lasso catheters and three dimensional electroanatomical mapping.,"BACKGROUND
Linear ablation of left atrium (LA) guided by three dimensional (3-D) electroanatomical mapping (Carto) has been used in many centres worldwide for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) instead of pure anatomical approaches. There were little data about linear ablation of LA guided by Carto and double Lasso catheters in China. We report the results of linear ablation of LA guided by both Carto and double Lasso catheters.


METHODS
After the anatomical model of LA and all pulmonary veins (PVs) had been established, circumferential ablations of the left pulmonary vein antrum and the right pulmonary vein antrum were performed with 2 circumferential mapping catheters (Lasso) placed within the ipsilateral superior and inferior PVs. The endpoint of ablation was abolishment or dissociation of the pulmonary vein potentials (PVPs). Oral amiodarone or propafenone was taken for at least 3 months by patients with persistent AF, permanent AF or those whose PVPs had not been isolated completely. The recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias was observed 3 months after the procedure.


RESULTS
There were 106 patients (mean age, 51.4 +/- 9.9 years). Seventy-eight patients had paroxysmal AF, 12 persistent AF and 16 permanent AF. Onset of atrial fibrillation occurred in 52 patients during ablation procedure. Thirty-two patients restored to sinus rhythm eventually after the procedure. Abolishment or dissociation of PVPs was accomplished during the procedure in 94 patients (88.7%). The duration of procedure and exposure to X-ray were (213 +/- 45) minutes and (32.5 +/- 12.8) minutes, respectively. Among the 87 patients followed up for over 3 months, 62 were free of atrial tachyarrhythmias (including 8 patients who were still taking oral amiodarone). The success rate was 71.3% in the first procedure. Two patients had pericardial effusion treated by pericardial puncture and effusion drainage. No pulmonary vein stenosis, atrioesophageal fistula, stroke or procedural death occurred.


CONCLUSIONS
Combination of double Lasso catheters with 3-D electroanatomical mapping to guide the linear ablation of left atrium procedure can confirm the isolation of PVPs.",2006,Chinese medical journal
PP-110 Impact of Lobe Number of Left Atrial Appendage on Cryoballoon-based Pulmonary Vein Isolation,"The American Journal of Cardiology MARCH 26e29, 2015 11 IN AND C PP-111 A New Tool for Catheter Ablation: Lasso Electroporation Catheter.

Currently, radiofrequency (RF) energy is the most widely accepted and used method for arrythmia ablation. However, RF ablation has potential disadvantages such as endocardial disruption, charring, platelet activation and thrombus formation, Alternative energy sources have been proposed for catheter ablation. Cryoablation, microwave, laser and ultrasound may be able to create longer, deeper, and more controlled lesions. Irreversible electroporation is a nonthermal ablative tool that uses direct electrical pulses to create irreversible membrane pores and eventual cell death. At present there is no commercially avaiable cardiac eletroporation cathater. But limited animal studies utilizing modified standart ablation cathaters have been reported. Here we present design of a lasso electroporation cathater. Defibrillators are widely used to terminate life-threatening arrhythmias. If defibrillator shock-induced transmembrane potentials are large enough, they can cause irreversible tissue damage due to electroporation. We use 10-polar lasso cathater. Positive and negative poles of all electrode pairs were connected in parallel (Figure 1A). And we connected these poles to transcutaneous pacing patch. Direct current electricity transmitted to lasso cathater when we applied shock from defibrillator paddles to the transcutaneous pacing patch(Figure 1B). We test our cathater in saline solution. Whenever we applied shock, bubbles were seen around the electrode pairs which mean our lasso electroporation cathater is functioning properly(Figure 1C). To our knowledge this is the first lasso electroporation cathater reported in literature. We applied local ethic committee for further animal studies. Future studies will establish the efficacy of this new and promising technology.",2015,American Journal of Cardiology
Estimation error of the constrained lasso,"This paper presents a non-asymptotic upper bound for the estimation error of the constrained lasso, under the high-dimensional (n â‰ª p) setting. In contrast to existing results, the error bound in this paper is sharp, is valid when the parameter to be estimated is not exactly sparse (e.g., when it is weakly sparse), and shows explicitly the effect of overestimating the â„“1-norm of the parameter to be estimated on the estimation performance. The results of this paper show that the constrained lasso is minimax optimal for estimating a parameter with bounded â„“1-norm, and also for estimating a weakly sparse parameter if its â„“1-norm is accessible.",2016,"2016 54th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)"
