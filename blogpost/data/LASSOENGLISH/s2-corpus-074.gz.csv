Right atrial tachycardia despite silent right atrium: a case report and review of the literature,"Atrial standstill (AS) is a rare condition defined by a lack of active atrial contraction caused by an inability of the atrial myocardium to create or perpetuate electrical activity. Drugs (e.g. quinidine or digitalis), electrolyte disorder as well as structural heart diseases (hypertensive heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease and myocarditis) and genetic predispositions may contribute to this condition [1â€“6]. Obstructive sleep apnea with consecutively increased right atrial pressure, underlying hypertension and paroxysms of atrial fibrillation might be further synergistically interacting contributing factors. According to the reports of Nakazato and Zipes AS seems to be a progressive disease which initially involves the high right atrium (RA) and then progresses towards the lower RA. Just the vicinity of the tricuspid valve, the lower interatrial septum and the region of the ostium of the coronary sinus remain excitable [5, 7]. As the main right atrium is not excitable, patients with AS and symptomatic bradycardia were often treated by implantation of a VVI pacemaker [5]. We present the case of a patient suffering from severe palpitations despite AS. We saw a 62-year-old male DDDR pacemaker (PM) patient, implanted due to intermittent AV-Block III in another hospital. Currently the patient suffered from severe palpitations during his atrial driven tachycardia with a heart rate of 105 bpm with 1:1 ventricular stimulation (cycle length 575 ms) for 8 weeks (Fig. 1a). Coronary heart disease had already been ruled out previously via coronary angiogram. Echocardiographic examination showed an only slightly reduced systolic left ventricular function (EF 48 %) without any major valvular dysfunction. Cardiac risk factors were hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus. Additionally, the patient suffered from obstructive sleep apnea and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. To better study tachycardia during the EP Study, PM was programmed from DDDR to VVI 30/min followed by a drop in ventricular rate to 53 bpm due to 2:1 atrioventricular block (Fig. 1c). Figure 2a depicts the catheter positioning with an electrical silent right atrium (RA) along the 20 polar halo catheter which could neither sense nor evoke electrical signals even under high output stimulation (Fig. 2a). Exclusively in the coronary sinus (CS) and directly adjacent areas a remnant strand of vital right atrial myocardium displayed rapid centrifugal activity (Fig. 2b). We performed entrainment stimulation along the coronary sinus electrodes where we achieved similar post-pacing intervals (PPI) at the most proximal pair of electrodes and consecutively longer PPIs while stimulating more distally. Atrial ectopy from the pulmonary veins was excluded after transseptal puncture with a 20-polar Lasso Catheter. A CS anomaly or a CS diverticle was ruled out by CS phlebography. 3-D electroanatomical mapping was employed after pacing manoeuvres including entrainment and post-pacing H. Bogossian (&) B. Lemke M.

Group lassoing change-points in piecewise-stationary AR signals,"Regularizing the least-squares criterion with the total number of coefficient changes, it is possible to estimate time-varying (TV) autoregressive (AR) models with piecewise-constant coefficients. Such models emerge in various applications including speech segmentation, biomedical signal processing, and geophysics. To cope with the inherent lack of continuity and the high computational burden when dealing with high-dimensional data sets, this paper introduces a convex regularization approach enabling efficient and continuous estimation of TV-AR models. To this end, the problem is cast as a sparse regression one with grouped variables, and is solved by resorting to the group least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). The fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from advances in variable selection and compressive sampling to signal segmentation. An efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed to implement the novel segmentation method. Issues regarding regularization and uniqueness of the solution are also discussed. Finally, an alternative segmentation technique is introduced to improve the detection of change instants. Numerical tests using synthetic and real data corroborate the merits of the developed segmentation techniques in identifying piecewise-constant TV-AR models.",2011,2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
Feature-specific penalized latent class analysis for genomic data.,"Genomic data are often characterized by a moderate to large number of categorical variables observed for relatively few subjects. Some of the variables may be missing or noninformative. An example of such data is loss of heterozygosity (LOH), a dichotomous variable, observed on a moderate number of genetic markers. We first consider a latent class model where, conditional on unobserved membership in one of k classes, the variables are independent with probabilities determined by a regression model of low dimension q. Using a family of penalties including the ridge and LASSO, we extend this model to address higher-dimensional problems. Finally, we present an orthogonal map that transforms marker space to a space of ""features"" for which the constrained model has better predictive power. We demonstrate these methods on LOH data collected at 19 markers from 93 brain tumor patients. For this data set, the existing unpenalized latent class methodology does not produce estimates. Additionally, we show that posterior classes obtained from this method are associated with survival for these patients.",2006,Biometrics
Construction of a Dicotomous Key for Common Local and Imported Timber Species in Sri Lanka,"Proper timber identification mechanism is essential today than ever before as lesser knownlocal and imported timber species are coming to timber market in present. In Sri Lanka thereare over 400 different timber species of commercial use, which show a remarkably widerange of variation in their physical properties as well as their anatomical structures. Hencetimber identification is a highly important task to confirm its authenticity. Scientific woodidentification is based on microscopic evaluation of anatomical properties. The objective is of this research is to develop a timber identification key for common localand imported timber species used in Sri Lanka to facilitate scientific identification of timberspecies based on anatomical features in IAWA (International Association of WoodAnatomist) list of 1989. Timber samples of local and imported timber species were collected from various floristicregions in Sri Lanka. Authentic timber samples were collected from Research Division of theState Timber Corporation. Transverse section (T.S), Radial Longitudinal Section (R.L.S.) andTangential Longitudinal Section (T.L.S.) were obtained using the Microtome. Microscopicslides were prepared for sixty seven timber species and photographic representations andanatomical details were presented. Anatomical features of rays, parenchyma and vessels werestudied. Tangential vessel diameter and ray height were also measured. Values of the meanvessel diameter were categorized according to IAWA: category 1( =200 Î¼m). The highest mean vessel diameter value was observed in Garcinia spp (Kandis) and secondhighest value was observed in Azadirachta indica (Margosa) timber species. The lowestMean Vessel Diameter value was observed in Elaeodendron glaucum (Neralu) timberspecies. Specific gravity values were taken from previous research and publications. Specific gravityare categorized three categories according to IAWA features: low ( = 0.75). The highest basic specific gravity value was observed in Diospyrosebenum (Ebony) (1.12) and second highest value was observed in Palu (1.1) timber species.The lowest basic specific gravity values were observed in Lunumidella and Rukattana timberspecies. Mean ray height of 67 timber species were measured using Micrometrics SE premium 4software available at research division in the State Timber Corporation. A dichotomous key on timber identification was prepared using 56 common local timberspecies and 11 major imported timber species mostly used in Sri Lanka to facilitate scientificidentification of timber species based on anatomical features of IAWA (InternationalAssociation of Wood Anatomist) List 1989.",2014,
"Amodiaquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and combination therapy for uncomplicated falciparum malaria: a randomized controlled trial from Burkina Faso.","Increasing resistance to chloroquine necessitates the evaluation of other antimalarial therapies in Africa. We compared the efficacies of amodiaquine (AQ), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and AQ + SP for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in a randomized trial of patients 6 months of age or older in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Of the 944 patients enrolled, 829 (88%; 53% under 5 years of age) were assigned 28-day efficacy outcomes. For all regimens, early treatment failures were uncommon (< 2%). Considering all treatment failures based on WHO criteria, AQ + SP was most efficacious (failures in 4.2%), followed by SP (9.1%) and AQ (17.9%; P < 0.02 for all pairwise comparisons). Considering only clinical failures, relative efficacies were similar (failures in 2.1% with AQ + SP, 6.5% with SP, and 13.2% with AQ; P < 0.02 for all pairwise comparisons). The risk of recrudescence was lower with AQ + SP (2.1%) compared with SP (6.1%, P = 0.02) and AQ (8.1%, P = 0.001). Risks of new infection were lower with AQ + SP (2.1%) and SP (2.4%) compared with AQ (9.1%, P < 0.001 for both comparisons). No serious adverse events were seen. AQ + SP appears to offer a highly effective, inexpensive, and available therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Burkina Faso.",2005,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene
Efficient RNA isoform identification and quantification from RNA-Seq data with network flows,"MOTIVATION
Several state-of-the-art methods for isoform identification and quantification are based on [Formula: see text]-regularized regression, such as the Lasso. However, explicitly listing the-possibly exponentially-large set of candidate transcripts is intractable for genes with many exons. For this reason, existing approaches using the [Formula: see text]-penalty are either restricted to genes with few exons or only run the regression algorithm on a small set of preselected isoforms.


RESULTS
We introduce a new technique called FlipFlop, which can efficiently tackle the sparse estimation problem on the full set of candidate isoforms by using network flow optimization. Our technique removes the need of a preselection step, leading to better isoform identification while keeping a low computational cost. Experiments with synthetic and real RNA-Seq data confirm that our approach is more accurate than alternative methods and one of the fastest available.

Regresi Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso) Pada Kasus Inflasi Di Indonesia Tahun 2014-2017,"ABSTRAK. Multikolinearitas merupakan salah satu pelanggaran asumsi klasik pada analisis regresi linear berganda yang disebabkan adanya hubungan linear diantara sebagian atau seluruh variabel independen dalam sebuah model regresi. Salah satu metode yang dapat menyelesaikan model regresi linear berganda yang terdapat multikolinearitas yaitu regresi Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Regresi LASSO mampu mengatasi masalah multikolinearitas dengan menyusutkan koefisien taksirannya mendekati nol, bahkan dapat hingga tepat nol. Sedemikian sehingga regresi LASSO dapat menyeleksi variabel di dalam model regresi. Regresi LASSO tidak memiliki solusi secara eksplisit dalam menentukan koefisien taksirannya, dengan demikiaN sehingga dibutuhkan pemrograman komputasi untuk menyelesaikannya. Algoritma LARS merupakan algoritma yang sangat efektif dalam membantu menyelesaikan solusi regresi LASSO secara komputasi. Dalam penelitian ini, diambil studi kasus mengenai inflasi yang terjadi di Indonesia tahun 2014-2017 sehingga inflasi merupakan variabel dependen dalam penelitian ini. Sedangkan variabel variabel independen yang terdapat dalam penelitian ini yaitu Produk Domestik Bruto, Ekspor Bersih, Jumlah Uang Beredar, Nilai Tukar Rupiah, Suku Bunga, Harga Beras, Upah Buruh Tani, dan Harga Minyak Dunia. Variabel-variabel independen tersebut termasuk pembahasan ekonomi makro yang besar kemungkinan saling mempengaruhi satu sama lain sehingga besar kemungkinan pula terjadinya multikolinearitas pada model regresi. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah menentukan variabel-variabel yang berpengaruh terhadap inflasi di Indonesia tahun 2014-2017 menggunakan regresi LASSO dan dibantu algoritma LARS dalam hal komputasi. Hasil dari penelitian ini diperoleh bahwa variabel-variabel yang berpengaruh terhadap inflasi yaitu Produk Domestik Bruto, Ekspor Bersih, Nilai Tukar Rupiah, Suku Bunga, Harga Beras, dan Upah Buruh Tani. Kata Kunci : Multikolinearitas, Regresi LASSO, LARS . REGRESI LEAST ABSOLUTE SHRINKAGE AND SELECTION OPERATOR (LASSO) IN THE CASE OF INFLATION IN INDONESIA, 2014-2017 ASTRACT. Multicollinearity is one of the violations of classical assumptions in multiple linear regression analysis due to a linear relationship between some or all of the independent variables in a regression model. One method that can solve the multiple linear regression model that contains multicollinearity is the regression of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). LASSO regression is able to solve the problem of multicollinearity by shrinking the estimated coefficients close to zero and even up to exactly zero, so that LASSO regression can select variables in the regression model. LASSO regression does not have an explicit solution of the estimated coefficient so that computational programming is needed to solve it. The LARS algorithm is a very effective algorithm in helping to solve the solutions of the LASSO regression. In this study, a case study was carried out on inflation that occurred in Indonesia in 2014-2017 so that inflation was the dependent variable in the model. In other side, the independent variables contained in this study are Gross Domestic Product, Net Export, Money Supply, Rupiah Exchange Rate, Interest Rate, Rice Price, Farmer Labor Wages, and World Oil Prices. These independent variables, including macroeconomic discussions, are likely to influence each other so that there is probably contain multicollinearity in the regression model. The purpose of this study is to determine the variables that influence inflation in Indonesia in 2014-2017 using LASSO regression and assisted by LARS algorithm. The results of this study found that the variables that influence inflation are Gross Domestic Product, Net Export, Rupiah Exchange Rate, Interest Rates, Rice Prices, and Farmer Labor Wages.

Tracking of time-varying genomic regulatory networks with a LASSO-Kalman smoother,"It is widely accepted that cellular requirements and environmental conditions dictate the architecture of genetic regulatory networks. Nonetheless, the status quo in regulatory network modeling and analysis assumes an invariant network topology over time. In this paper, we refocus on a dynamic perspective of genetic networks, one that can uncover substantial topological changes in network structure during biological processes such as developmental growth. We propose a novel outlook on the inference of time-varying genetic networks, from a limited number of noisy observations, by formulating the network estimation as a target tracking problem. We overcome the limited number of observations (small n large p problem) by performing tracking in a compressed domain. Assuming linear dynamics, we derive the LASSO-Kalman smoother, which recursively computes the minimum mean-square sparse estimate of the network connectivity at each time point. The LASSO operator, motivated by the sparsity of the genetic regulatory networks, allows simultaneous signal recovery and compression, thereby reducing the amount of required observations. The smoothing improves the estimation by incorporating all observations. We track the time-varying networks during the life cycle of the Drosophila melanogaster. The recovered networks show that few genes are permanent, whereas most are transient, acting only during specific developmental phases of the organism.",2014,EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology
Microbial diversity and ecology of the Soda Lakes of East Africa,"Soda lakes are highly alkaline aquatic environments where evaporative concentration results in carbonate as a major dissolved anion. In these very productive environments prokaryotic photo-synthetic primary production is probably the driving force behind all nutrient recycling in these lakes. The major trophic groups responsible for cycling of carbon and sulphur have in general now been identified. Although there are many parallels with athalassohaline salt lake systems, systematic studies have shown that the microbes are obligately alkaliphilic or alkali-tolerant and many appear to represent separate alkaliphilic lineages within recognized taxa, indicating they may have evolved separately within the alkaline environment. As evaporative concentration continues, chloride ions also dominate in solution. As a consequence, a quite different population of prokaryotes is present in the trona (sodium sesquicarbonate) beds and concentrated lagoon brines of hypersaline lakes (Magadi-Natron basin) compared with more dilute lakes elsewhere in the East African Rift Valley.",1999,
Lasso with convex loss: Model selection consistency and estimation,"Abstract Variable selection is a fundamental challenge in statistical learning if one works with data sets containing huge amount of predictors. In this artical we consider procedures popular in model selection: Lasso and adaptive Lasso. Our goal is to investigate properties of estimators based on minimization of Lasso-type penalized empirical risk with a convex loss function, in particular nondifferentiable. We obtain theorems concerning rate of convergence in estimation, consistency in model selection and oracle properties for Lasso estimators if the number of predictors is fixed, i.e. it does not depend on the sample size. Moreover, we study properties of Lasso and adaptive Lasso estimators on simulated and real data sets.",2016,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
Penalized empirical likelihood for partially linear errors-in-variables models,"In this paper, we study penalized empirical likelihood for parameter estimation and variable selection in partially linear models with measurement errors in possibly all the variables. By using adaptive Lasso penalty function, we show that penalized empirical likelihood has the oracle property. That is, with probability tending to one, penalized empirical likelihood identifies the true model and estimates the nonzero coefficients as efficiently as if the sparsity of the true model was known in advance. Also, we introduce the penalized empirical likelihood ratio statistic to test a linear hypothesis of the parameter and prove that it follows an asymptotic Chi-square distribution under the null hypothesis. Some simulations and an application are given to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.",2020,AStA Advances in Statistical Analysis
On the Degrees of Freedom of Mixed Matrix Regression,"With the increasing prominence of big data in modern science, data of interest are more complex and stochastic. To deal with the complex matrix and vector data, this paper focuses on the mixed matrix regression model. We mainly establish the degrees of freedom of the underlying stochastic model, which is one of the important topics to construct adaptive selection criteria for efficiently selecting the optimal model fit. Under some mild conditions, we prove that the degrees of freedom of mixed matrix regression model are the sum of the degrees of freedom of Lasso and regularized matrix regression. Moreover, we establish the degrees of freedom of nuclear-norm regularization multivariate regression. Furthermore, we prove that the estimates of the degrees of freedom of the underlying models process the consistent property.",2017,Mathematical Problems in Engineering
Bayesian Model Selection for Ultrahigh-Dimensional Doubly-Intractable Distributions with an Application to Network Psychometrics,"Doubly intractable distributions commonly arise in many complex statistical models in physics, epidemiology, ecology, social science, among other disciplines. With an increasing number of model parameters, they often result in ultrahigh-dimensional posterior distributions; this is a challenging problem and is crucial for developing the computationally feasible approach. A particularly important application of ultrahigh-dimensional doubly intractable models is network psychometrics, which gets attention in item response analysis. However, its parameter estimation method, maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator (MPLE) combining with lasso certainly ignores the dependent structure, so that it is inaccurate. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo methods by using Bayesian variable selection methods to identify strong interactions automatically. With our new algorithm, we address some inferential and computational challenges: (1) likelihood functions involve doubly-intractable normalizing functions, and (2) increasing number of items can lead to ultrahigh dimensionality in the model. We illustrate the application of our approaches to challenging simulated and real item response data examples for which studying local dependence is very difficult. The proposed algorithm shows significant inferential gains over existing methods in the presence of strong dependence among items.",2019,arXiv: Computation
On the residual empirical process based on the ALASSO in high dimensions and its functional oracle property,"This paper considers post variable-selection inference in a high dimensional penalized regression model based on the ALASSO method of Zou (2006). It is shown that under suitable sparsity conditions, the residual empirical process based on the ALASSO provides valid inference methodology in very high dimensional regression problems where conventional methods fail. It is also shown that the ALASSO based residual empirical process satisfies a functional oracle property, i.e., in addition to selecting the set of relevant variables with probability tending to one, the ALASSO based residual empirical process converges to the same limiting Gaussian process as the OLS based residual empirical process under the oracle. The functional oracle property is critically exploited to construct asymptotically valid confidence bands for the error distribution function and prediction intervals for unobserved values of the response variable in the high dimensional set up, where traditional non-penalized methods are known to fail. Simulation results are presented illustrating finite sample performance of the proposed methodology.",2015,Journal of Econometrics

"125 WORKING TOGETHER: FOREST-LINKED SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE ASSOCIATIONS AND COLLECTIVE ACTION DuncanMacqueen,SharmisthaBose,","Small and medium forest enterprises (SMFEs) provide an opportunity to reducepoverty and sustain forests. But they face a number of critical bottlenecks to theirdevelopment (e.g. insecure forest access, lack of market information or bargainingpower). Working together in associations can overcome such bottlenecks wherefew other support structures exist. There are literally thousands of forest-linkedsmall and medium enterprise associations in developing countries. Many arise spon-taneously from strong collective interest. Some fail, but many succeed. Successfulassociations are the means to achieve three important development â€˜endsâ€™:â€  Reducing transaction costs â€  Adapting strategically to new opportunities â€  Lobbying for more supportive policies This paper draws out some lessons on how and why associations work. Itsummarises research from Brazil, China, Guyana, India, South Africa and Uganda. The research found that lasting associations generally have a strong degree ofautonomy. They usually have leaders with a track-record of social commitment.Most have gradually evolving sets of procedures that institutionalise the progressmade by charismatic founders. Their focus is usually restricted to a few long-termissues. Equity is highest where there is greatest investment in democracy. Equitableassociations tend to pay attention to transparency over costs and benefits. Mostalso have in place sanctions for free riders or those who break their rules, and clearprocedures for resolving conflicts. The single major policy implication is that forest based associations can and dowork. They work in places where there is little else to improve the livelihoods ofthe poor. Decision-makers should support them as a result; the most useful supporttends to be responsive rather than imposed. It is usually orientated towards self-helpoptions such as strengthening umbrella associations and improving awareness ofexisting support services. It often has a strong focus on providing information onbureaucratic procedures, product design and markets, finance and technologicalinnovation.",2006,
Sparse Linear Models and Proximal Optimization,"Sparse models are growing in popularity as the amount of data available is becoming bigger. Feature selection methods have been around for many years, but the problems to solve evolve quite rapidly. If ten years ago a dataset with hundreds of variables was considered quite large, today datasets with ten thousands of variables are a common problem and easy to find. Hence, sparse models are not evaluated only by the error of the fit but also by its interpretability. This means that sometimes we might prefer a model with â€œworseâ€ error if we can learn some structure of the problem from it. In this thesis we will provide an overview of the classic sparse models, starting with the Lasso and, from that point, we will dicuss the more modern proximal optimization theory. The main result is the FISTA algorithm, which is a general framework to optimize any combination of differentiable function and convex regularization. An implementation of FISTA in ANSI C was also developed along with this thesis, and it is publicly available on the Internet. Finally we will present some experiments where all the previous models are compared using real-world datasets.",2013,
Localization of Diffusion Source in Networks With the Noisy Data,"Locating diffusion source in network is an important issue in network data analysis. Many methods have been developed. However, noiseless assumption used in the literature is restrictive and the methods are not robust enough.

Since the sample size is much smaller than the dimension of unknown parameters, the Lasso method is used to identify the locating diffusion source in networks. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our method. Keywords-localization; spreading nodes; lasso method; noisy data",2017,
50 Volatile organic compounds predict the last week of life in lung cancer patients,"Background Recognising dying is difficult and is an ongoing difficulty for doctors. We believe there is a process to dying and animal studies support this theory. We previously demonstrated that a number of volatile organic compounds in urine, change in the last weeks and days of life of patients in a small mixed cancer group. We needed to verify this finding in a suitably powered follow-up study. Method We prospectively collected urine samples from people with lung cancer. We aimed to compare samples from 25 people in each of the last 3 weeks of life to a control group, 50 people with lung cancer who lived 3 or more months from the time of sampling. The urine samples were analysed for volatile organic compounds by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression was used to analyse the GC-MS data and create a statistical model. Results We recruited 162 people in total; 29 in the last week; 28 in the second last week; 30 in the third last week of life; 74 controls i.e. samples taken >3 months from death; 424 urine samples. A model was created to predict whether a patient would die within 1â€‰week. It has an optimism corrected AUC of 0.851 (95% CI: 0.767, 0.911); sensitivity 78.6% (95% CI: (64.3%, 89.3%)); specificity 83.1% (95% CI: (69.9%, 92.3%)). The model identified a selection of compounds that contributed to the identification of patients who were close to death. Discussion The results confirm that volatile organic compounds can predict when people with lung cancer are in the last week of life. Our model to predict when a person with lung cancer is in the last week of life is approximately 80% accurate.",2019,BMJ

Sparse Sliced Inverse Regression,"Sliced inverse regression (SIR) is an innovative and effective method for dimension reduction and data visualization of high-dimensional problems. It replaces the original variables with low-dimensional linear combinations of predictors without any loss of regression information and without the need to prespecify a model or an error distribution. However, it suffers from the fact that each SIR component is a linear combination of all the original predictors; thus, it is often difficult to interpret the extracted components. By representing SIR as a regression-type optimization problem, we propose in this article a new method, called sparse SIR, that combines the shrinkage idea of the lasso with SIR to produce both accurate and sparse solutions. The efficacy of the proposed method is verified by simulation, and a real data example is given.",2006,Technometrics
Left atrial shape predicts recurrence after atrial fibrillation catheter ablation,"INTRODUCTION
Multiple markers left atrium (LA) remodeling, including LA shape, correlate with outcomes in atrial fibrillation (AF). Catheter ablation is an important treatment of AF, but better tools are needed to determine which patients will benefit. In this study, we use particle-based modeling to quantitatively assess LA shape, and determine to what degree it predicts AF recurrence after catheter ablation.


METHODS AND RESULTS
There were 254 patients enrolled in the DECAAF study who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging of the LA prior to AF ablation and were followed for recurrence for up to 475 days. We performed particle-based shape modeling on each patient's LA shape. We selected shape parameters using the LASSO method and factor analysis, and then added them to a Cox regression model, which included multiple clinical parameters and LA fibrosis. We computed Harrell's C-statistic with and without shape in the model. We used the model to stratify patients into recurrence risk classes by both shape and shape and fibrosis combined. Three shape parameters were selected for inclusion. The C-statistic increased from 0.68 to 0.72 when shape was added to the model (PÂ <Â 0.05). Visualized shapes showed that a more round LA shape with a shorter, more laterally rotated appendage was predictive of recurrence.


CONCLUSION
LA shape is an independent predictor of recurrence after AF ablation. When combined with LA fibrosis, shape analysis using PBM may improve patient selection for ablation.",2018,Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology
Efficiency of Bayesian Approaches in Quantile Regression with Small Sample Size,"Quantile regression is a statistical technique intended to estimate, and conduct inference about the conditional quantile functions. Just as the classical linear regression methods estimate model for the conditional mean function, quantile regression offers a mechanism for estimating models for the conditional median function, and the full range of other conditional quantile functions. In the Bayesian approach to variable selection prior distributions representing the subjective beliefs about the parameters are assigned to the regression coefficients. The estimation of parameters and the selection of the best subset of variables is accomplished by using adaptive lasso quantile regression. In this paper we describe, compare, and apply the two suggested Bayesian approaches. The two suggested Bayesian suggested approaches are used to select the best subset of variables and estimate the parameters of the quantile regression equation when small sample sizes are used. Simulations show that the proposed approaches are very competitive in terms of variable selection, estimation accuracy and efficient when small sample sizes are used.",2018,
Optimizing deep learning networks using multi-armed bandits,"Deep learning has gained significant attention recently following their successful use for applications such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. These deep learning models are based on very large neural networks, which can require a significant amount of memory and hence limit the range of applications. Hence, this study explores methods for pruning deep learning models as a way of reducing their size, and computational time, but without sacrificing their accuracy. A literature review was carried out, revealing existing approaches for pruning, their strengths, and weaknesses. A key issue emerging from this review is that there is a trade-off between removing a weight or neuron and the potential reduction in accuracy. Thus, this study develops new algorithms for pruning that utilize a framework, known as a multi-armed bandit, which has been successfully applied in applications where there is a need to learn which option to select given the outcome of trials. There are several different multi-arm bandit methods, and these have been used to develop new algorithms including those based on the following types of multi-arm bandits: (i) Epsilon-Greedy (ii) Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) (iii) Thompson Sampling and (iv) Exponential Weight Algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (EXP3). The algorithms were implemented in Python and a comprehensive empirical evaluation of their performance was carried out in comparison to both the original neural network models and existing algorithms for pruning. The existing methods that are compared include: Random Pruning, Greedy Pruning, Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) and Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS). The thesis also includes an empirical comparison with a number of other learning methods such as KNN, decision trees, SVM, Naive Bayes, LDA, QDA, logistic regression, Gaussian process classifier, kernel ridge regression, LASSO regression, linear regression, Bayesian Ridge regression, boosting, bagging and random forests. The results on the data sets show that some of the new methods (i) generalize better than the original model and most of the other methods such as KNN and decision trees (ii) outperform OBS and OBD in terms of reduction in size, generalization, and computational time (iii) outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of accuracy.",2017,
Bilateral renal stones associated with nail-patella syndrome.,"Dr. Sanjiv Saxena, Assistant Professor, Department of Nephrology, AIIMS, New Delhi-110029 (India) Dear Sir, The nail-patella syndrome (hereditary osteo-onychodysplasia or HOOD) is a well-recognized autosomal dominant disorder characterized by nail, skeletal and renal abnormalities. A spectrum of renal involvement has been described in patients with the nail-patella syndrome [1,2]. Although Glassock et al. [3] mention that a disproportionate number of these patients may have renal stones (references not quoted), on review of the literature, we came across only three case reports describing such an association [2, 4, 5]. However, all the above three cases had evidence of unilateral calculus disease. A 23-year-old male was referred to the Nephrology Services of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi in June 1993 for the management of chronic renal failure. He had a history of recurrent bilateral renal colics for the preceeding 3 years and had undergone pyelolithotomy on the right side and ureteroli-thotomy on the left side for bilateral calculus disease 2 years earlier in a district hospital. The status of his renal functions at the time of surgery was not known. The patient had no subsequent colics and repeated skiagrams revealed no radiopaque calculi. However, for the preceding 4 months, he started having anasarca and was found to have mild hypertension and moderately severe azotemia. There was no history of renal calculus disease or any other renal illness in the family. Clinical examination revealed severe pallor, mild hypertension and changes of chronic azotemia. In addition, the patient had dystro-phic nails in both upper and lower limbs, fixed flexion deformity of the right elbow, bilaterally small hypoplastic patellae and bilaterally palpable iliac horns. There were surgical scars of pyelolithotomy and ureteroli-thotomy on the right side and left side of the abdomen, respectively. Neither of the kidneys was palpable. Laboratory evaluation confirmed the presence of severe anemia with Hb 0.70 mmol/l (4.7g/dl) and severe azotemia with serum cre-atinine of 1,408 Î¼mol/l (16.0 mg/dl). Urine examination revealed 2+proteinuria and 8-10 WBCs per high power field on microscopy. 24-hour urine examination showed 1.98g proteinuria and a creatinine clearance of 4 ml/ min. Skeletal survey revealed bilateral iliac horns, bilaterally hypoplastic patellae and an ill-developed capitellum of right radius.

A Support Detection and Root Finding Approach for Learning High-dimensional Generalized Linear Models,"Feature selection is important for modeling high-dimensional data, where the number of variables can be much larger than the sample size. In this paper, we develop a support detection and root finding procedure to learn the high dimensional sparse generalized linear models and denote this method by GSDAR. Based on the KKT condition for $\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimations, GSDAR generates a sequence of estimators iteratively. 
Under some restricted invertibility conditions on the maximum likelihood function and sparsity assumption on the target coefficients, the errors of the proposed estimate decays exponentially to the optimal order. Moreover, the oracle estimator can be recovered if the target signal is stronger than the detectable level. 
We conduct simulations and real data analysis to illustrate the advantages of our proposed method over several existing methods, including Lasso and MCP.",2020,ArXiv
The pollution level of the blaOXA-58 carbapenemase gene in coastal water and its host bacteria characteristics.,"This paper investigated 10 carbapenemase genes and selected the hosts of these genes in the estuary of Bohai Bay. The results showed that the OXA-58 producer accounted for a large percentage of carbapenem resistant bacteria in the sampling points, whereas the VIM, KPC, NDM, IMP, GES, OXA-23, OXA-24, OXA-48 and OXA-51 producers were not detected in the study. In addition, 9 bacterial genera with 100% identical blaOXA-58 sequences, including Pseudomonas, Rheinheimera, Stenotrophomonas, Shewanella, Raoultella, Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, Algoriphagus, Bowmanella and Thalassospira, were isolated from seawater. It is suggested that the host of blaOXA-58 gene were varied and many kinds of them could survive in the seawater. Moreover, we preformed the quantitative RT-PCR and the result shown the abundance of blaOXA-58 fluctuated between 2.8Ã—10-6 copies/16S and 2.46Ã—10-4 copies/16S, which was of the same order of magnitude as some common antibiotic resistance genes in environment. Furthermore, the variation trend of blaOXA-58 gene suggested that pollution discharge and horizontal gene transfer could contribute to the increase of the gene in coastal area.",2019,Environmental pollution
"The Sporo-pollen Analyses and Ore-forming Age of Nong Bok Formation in Khammouane,Laos","The study of salt-bearing strata in Laos has an important significance for clarifying evolution law and potash deposit genesis in the whole Khorat plateau and its sub-basin.There has existed controversy among researchers both in China and abroad concerning the age of salt-bearing strata.The authors analyzed sporopollen over the potassium salt layer of ZK012 in the Wentai mining area of Khammouane,Laos.According to the characteristics of sporopollen,the authors define it as Classopollis-Ephedripites-Exesipollenites assemblage.In combination with the discovery of the index fossils of Callistopollenites,Normapolles,Cicatricosisporites,Clavatipollenites,Asteropollis and Trisolissporites,the authors hold that the age of sporopollen assemblage in ZK012 drill hole is between Turonian and Santonian of Late Cretaceous,and the climate condition should be a hot,tropical and south subtropical environment.A comparative analysis of the sedimentary characteristics of ZK309 drill hole was also made,which has the same depositional sequence as ZK012.In addition,the unconformity between the evaporate and the underlying sandstone was found at the bottom of ZK309.On such a basis,the authors consider that the Yanshanian movement in early Late Cretaceous caused the rising of the earth crust and the tectonic deformation of this area.Ancient seawater was retained in the big trap structure of Khorat basin along with the regression,and evaporites were deposited under the condition of subsequent arid climate.",2012,
A cyclic projected gradient method,"In recent years, convex optimization methods were successfully applied for various image processing tasks and a large number of first-order methods were designed to minimize the corresponding functionals. Interestingly, it was shown recently in Grewenig et al. (2010) that the simple idea of so-called â€œsuperstep cyclesâ€ leads to very efficient schemes for time-dependent (parabolic) image enhancement problems as well as for steady state (elliptic) image compression tasks. The â€œsuperstep cyclesâ€ approach is similar to the nonstationary (cyclic) Richardson method which has been around for over sixty years.In this paper, we investigate the incorporation of superstep cycles into the projected gradient method. We show for two problems in compressive sensing and image processing, namely the LASSO approach and the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model that the resulting simple cyclic projected gradient algorithm can numerically compare with various state-of-the-art first-order algorithms. However, due to the nonlinear projection within the algorithm convergence proofs even under restrictive assumptions on the linear operators appear to be hard. We demonstrate the difficulties by studying the simplest case of a two-cycle algorithm in â„2 with projections onto the Euclidean ball.",2013,Computational Optimization and Applications
High dimensional robust M-estimation: asymptotic variance via approximate message passing,"In a recent article, El Karoui et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 110(36):14557â€“14562, 2013) study the distribution of robust regression estimators in the regime in which the number of parameters p is of the same order as the number of samples n. Using numerical simulations and â€˜highly plausibleâ€™ heuristic arguments, they unveil a striking new phenomenon. Namely, the regression coefficients contain an extra Gaussian noise component that is not explained by classical concepts such as the Fisher information matrix. We show here that that this phenomenon can be characterized rigorously using techniques that were developed by the authors for analyzing the Lasso estimator under high-dimensional asymptotics. We introduce an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm to compute M-estimators and deploy state evolution to evaluate the operating characteristics of AMP and so also M-estimates. Our analysis clarifies that the â€˜extra Gaussian noiseâ€™ encountered in this problem is fundamentally similar to phenomena already studied for regularized least squares in the setting $$n",2013,Probability Theory and Related Fields

ABSTRACT 
THE SOCIAL REPRESENTATIONS AND THE CRISIS OF PATRIOTIC SYMBOLS IN ARGENTINA AT THE BEGINNIGN THE THIRD MILENNIUM Based on a discourse analysis (Wodak, 2003) of presidential speeches and elementary reading books, this paper argues that the Argentine crisis cannot be fully grasped without considering the link between social representations (Moscovici, 2001) and ingrained conceptions of national identity. How at other studies (Lasso, 2007; Lasso and Camuffo, 2008), this analysis put the attention to the cultural frames and cognitive patterns that underlie the connection between civil society and political society. The analysis finds that national symbols and definitional questions of national purpose are key factors in the way citizens behave in the context of the postmodernism and an political crisis.

Identifying individual sleep apnea/hypoapnea epochs using smartphone-based pulse oximetry,"Sleep apnea, characterized by frequent pauses in breathing during sleep, poses a serious threat to the healthy growth and development of children. Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for sleep apnea diagnosis, is resource intensive and confined to sleep laboratories, thus reducing its accessibility. Pulse oximetry alone, providing blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and blood volume changes in tissue (PPG), has the potential to identify children with sleep apnea. Thus, we aim to develop a tool for at-home sleep apnea screening that provides a detailed and automated 30 sec epoch-by-epoch sleep apnea analysis. We propose to extract features characterizing pulse oximetry (SpO2 and pulse rate variability [PRV], a surrogate measure of heart rate variability) to create a multivariate logistic regression model that identifies epochs containing apnea/hypoapnea events. Overnight pulse oximetry was collected using a smartphone-based pulse oximeter, simultaneously with standard PSG from 160 children at the British Columbia Children's hospital. The sleep technician manually scored all apnea/hypoapnea events during the PSG study. Based on these scores we labeled each epoch as containing or not containing apnea/hypoapnea. We randomly divided the subjects into training data (40%), used to develop the model applying the LASSO method, and testing data (60%), used to validate the model. The developed model was assessed epoch-by-epoch for each subject. The test dataset had a median area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 81%; the model provided a median accuracy of 74% sensitivity of 75%, and specificity of 73% when using a risk threshold similar to the percentage of apnea/hypopnea epochs. Thus, providing a detailed epoch-by-epoch analysis with at-home pulse oximetry alone is feasible with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values above 73% However, the performance might decrease when analyzing subjects with a low number of apnea/hypoapnea events.",2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
Implementation of genome-wide selection in wheat,"With the expected development of thousands of molecular markers in most crops, the marker-assisted selection theory has recently shifted from the use of a few markers targeted in QTL regions (or derived from candidate or validated genes) to the use of many more markers covering the whole genome. These genome-wide markers are already used for association analysis between polymorphisms for anonymous markers and qualitative or quantitative traits. The condition for success is that a sufficient level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) exists between the adjacent markers used for genotyping and the true genes or QTLs. This LD is known to vary among species and type of genetic material. In selfing species, particularly among breeding lines, LD has been reported to range up to 1 cM or more. In such conditions, uncharacterized markers can be used to predict the breeding value of a trait without referring to actual QTLs. We present an example applying DArT markers to the INRA wheat breeding material in an attempt to implement whole genome selection as an alternative to phenotypic selection. This study assesses different models (GBLUP, Ridge Regression BLUP, Bayesian Ridge Regression and Lasso) and their ability to predict the yields of genotypes evaluated in a multi-site network from 2000 to 2009 in a highly unbalanced design. The prediction coefficients obtained by cross-validation techniques are encouraging, given the small size of the training population.",2012,Russian Journal of Genetics: Applied Research

Monitoring seasonal influenza epidemics by using internet search data with an ensemble penalized regression model,"Seasonal influenza epidemics cause serious public health problems in China. Search queries-based surveillance was recently proposed to complement traditional monitoring approaches of influenza epidemics. However, developing robust techniques of search query selection and enhancing predictability for influenza epidemics remains a challenge. This study aimed to develop a novel ensemble framework to improve penalized regression models for detecting influenza epidemics by using Baidu search engine query data from China. The ensemble framework applied a combination of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) and rank aggregation method to optimize penalized regression models. Different algorithms including lasso, ridge, elastic net and the algorithms in the proposed ensemble framework were compared by using Baidu search engine queries. Most of the selected search terms captured the peaks and troughs of the time series curves of influenza cases. The predictability of the conventional penalized regression models were improved by the proposed ensemble framework. The elastic net regression model outperformed the compared models, with the minimum prediction errors. We established a Baidu search engine queries-based surveillance model for monitoring influenza epidemics, and the proposed model provides a useful tool to support the public health response to influenza and other infectious diseases.",2017,Scientific Reports
"A new approach to improving the tissue grip of the medial-row repair in the suture-bridge technique: the ""modified lasso-loop stitch"".","The double-row rotator cuff repair has proved to be biomechanically superior to the single-row technique. However, this has not been shown clinically. At the moment, all the methods proposed for medial-row suturing in the suture-bridge technique recommend a mattress suture or a simple stitch. The lasso-loop stitch has been proposed as a technique to improve tissue grip and has been used in open rotator cuff repairs, in biceps tenodesis, and in the Bankart procedure. We propose a method in which a modified version of this stitch can be used to repair the medial row of a double-row repair. In the ""modified lasso-loop stitch,"" a circumferential stitch is constructed over the posteromedial and anteromedial anchor. This stitch exerts an appropriate amount of radial compression on the encased tendon as the tails of the posteromedial and anteromedial suture are fixed to the anterolateral anchor. Through this technique, the reduction force is augmented and a compression force is created, thus allowing restoration of the rotator cuff footprint. This technique provides a strong cuff-suture interface while appropriate tensioning of the modified lasso-loop stitch allows minimal strangulation of the tendon. This technique has been shown to work with and without a knot.",2009,Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association
"Protocol for a prospective, observational cohort study of awareness in mechanically ventilated patients admitted from the emergency department: the ED-AWARENESS study","INTRODUCTION
Awareness with paralysis is a complication with potentially devastating psychological consequences for mechanically ventilated patients. While rigorous investigation into awareness has occurred for operating room patients, little attention has been paid outside of this domain. Mechanically ventilated patients in the emergency department (ED) have been historically managed in a way that predisposes them to awareness events: high incidence of neuromuscular blockade use, underdosing of analgesia and sedation, delayed administration of analgesia and sedation after intubation, and a lack of monitoring of sedation targets and depth. These practice patterns are discordant to recommendations for reducing the incidence of awareness, suggesting there is significant rationale to examine awareness in the ED population.


METHODS AND ANALYSIS
This is a single centre, prospective cohort study examining the incidence of awareness in mechanically ventilated ED patients. A cohort of 383 mechanically ventilated ED patients will be included. The primary outcome is awareness with paralysis. Qualitative reports of all awareness events will be provided. Recognising the potential problem with conventional multivariable analysis arising from a small number of events (expected less than 10-phenomenon of separation), Firth penalised method, exact logistic regression model or penalised maximum likelihood estimation shrinkage (Ridge, LASSO) will be used to assess for predictors of awareness.

Memory Cocktail Therapy: A General Learning-Based Framework to Optimize Dynamic Tradeoffs in NVMs,"Non-volatile memories (NVMs) have attracted significant interest recently due to their high-density, low static power, and persistence. There are, however, several challenges associated with building practical systems from NVMs, including limited write endurance and long latencies. Researchers have proposed a variety of architectural techniques which can achieve different tradeoffs between lifetime, performance and energy efficiency; however, no individual technique can satisfy requirements for all applications and different objectives. Hence, we propose Memory Cocktail Therapy (MCT), a general learning-based framework that adaptively chooses the best techniques for the current application and objectives.Specifically, MCT performs four procedures to adapt the techniques to various scenarios. First, MCT formulates a high-dimensional configuration space from all different combinations of techniques. Second, MCT selects primary features from the configuration space with lasso regularization. Third, MCT estimates lifetime, performance and energy consumption using lightweight online predictors (eg. quadratic regression and gradient boosting) and a small set of configurations guided by the selected features. Finally, given the estimation of all configurations, MCT selects the optimal configuration based on the user-defined objectives. As a proof of concept, we test MCTâ€™s ability to guarantee different lifetime targets and achieve 95% of maximum performance, while minimizing energy consumption. We find that MCT improves performance by 9.24% and reduces energy by 7.95% compared to the best static configuration. Moreover, the performance of MCT is 94.49% of the ideal configuration with only 5.3% more energy consumption.

"A geochemical study of Roman to early Byzantine Glass from Sagalassos, South-west Turkey","Abstract The finding of glass chunks together with fuel ash slag and kiln fragments related to glass processing strongly suggests local secondary production (working) of glass at Sagalassos (SW Turkey) from imperial to early Byzantine times. Chemical evidence shows that different silica raw materials were used in imperial and early Byzantine times for blue and green glass found locally. Colourless glass shows no clear difference in chemical composition and hence in silica raw materials between late Roman and early Byzantine times. Locally found early Byzantine yellow-green glass and chunks correspond to the previously defined Byzantine HIMT glass type. The chemical composition of the glass chunks found, identical to that of the contemporary glass of the same colour, strongly indicates that these chunks were used for the manufacture of early Byzantine green, colourless and yellow-green glass at Sagalassos. The homogenous lead isotopic composition of the chronological groups of blue glass, suggests the use of two distinct but homogenous silica raw materials for the manufacture of this glass. In view of this homogeneity, it is likely that contemporary blue glass was produced at a single location. The linear trend of the heterogeneous lead isotopic composition of the green and colourless glass is a strong indication of recycling effects in the glass composition. The end members of this trend are formed by the isotopic composition of the blue glass on the one hand, and of the yellow-green (HIMT) glass on the other hand. The heterogeneous lead isotopic composition of the yellow-green glass at Sagalassos is probably the result of recycling of this glass, reflecting mixtures of the original lead isotopic signatures of the broken glass and the original HIMT glass chunks. It should be noted that the two main raw materials for primary glass production (silica and soda) were available on the territory of Sagalassos. Moreover, the lead isotopic composition of quartz pebbles sampled from the artisanal quarter of Sagalassos, is similar to that of the local blue glass.",2005,Journal of Archaeological Science
Sensitivity Analysis of A Mangrove Ecosystem Model,"Mangrove ecosystems represent one of the most important ecosystems in terms of commercial use, inasmuch as their productivity is comparable to that of coral reefs and sea grass beds. In the present article, a comparaÂ­ tive analysis is presented for delineating the ecological significance of mangrove ecosystems. Then, a mangrove ecosystem computer model is analyzed, and sensitivity analyses identify key parameters in the design of environmental management plans aimed at optimal and judicious use of mangroves. Analytical expressions are derived for steady state conditions. Moreover, conditions for ecological feasibility are also ascertained. Tidal action and nutrient inputs from terrestrial run-off turn out to be one of the most important controlling factors with respect to detritus export and nutrient cycling. INTRODUCTION The intertidal mud flat zones of tropical seas and estuaries are occupied by trees and shrubs known as mangroves. They constitute one of the most important tropical marine ecosystems, the productivity of which is comparable to that of coral reefs and sea grass beds [1]. The major portion of production is the mangrove vegetation itself. Organic matter production in a mangrove ecosystem has been reported to be very high [2, 3]. Litter fall and detritus decomposition are 57 Â© 1998, Bay wood Publishing Co., Inc. doi: 10.2190/TCD0-CVUF-KY8B-46PL http://baywood.com 58 / PANDEY AND KHANNA one of the most important processes which distinguish mangroves from other ecosystems [3,4]. Detritus decomposition enhances nutrient regeneration and recycling. This is mainly because of the fact that plants, microbes, and animal components are so inextricably interwoven that nutrients are very rapidly reabsorbed soon after they are released. Mangrove swamps develop on the margins of estuarine and coastal regions, and they play the dual role of land builders and protectors of coastal areas during periods of high tides and strong winds. Hence they function as solar-powered, tidally-subsidized, pulse-stabilized ecosystems. They also serve as an important exporter of organic matter to adjacent bays and assume significance mainly for the following reasons [1,5]: 1. in fisheries, they serve as a source of very rich nutrients and highly useful tannin; 2. they act as an erosion barrier and land builder; 3. they aid in soil formation by trapping debris; 4. they filter land run-off and thus control terrestrial organic matter; 5. they serve as a habitat for many species of fish, invertebrates, and birds; 6. they are a major producer of the detritus that contributes to offshore proÂ­ ductivity; and 7. they are also used in honey and charcoal production. However, due to several anthropogenic activities, the mangroves, in general, are being continuously exploited and destroyed. Manufacturing of coal and mining of economically important mineral resources such as tin, iron, and manÂ­ ganese are few of the activities by which mangroves are being continuously exploited. Hence, ways and means have to be strategically framed in order to conserve and protect such ecologically important zones [6]. For their healthy ecological functioning, it is important for mangroves to receive a steady input of terrestrial nutrients so as to maintain their characteristic rates of growth. Thus, among other things, mangrove management requires mainÂ­ tenance of terrestrial run-off patterns. This necessitates studying the sensitivity of mangrove ecosystems in terms of various controlling and forcing functions. Factors such as dissolved oxygen, tidal effects, and solar radiation constitute important regulatory forcing functions [7]. Sensitivity studies of forest biomass [8], detritus, and nutrient cycling with respect to these factors helps immensely in the ecological analysis by helping to understand and quantify their roles in the management of ecosystem. In the present article, a mangrove ecosystem model is analyzed [7] to reveal the sensitivity of state variables with respect to ecologically significant parameters [9]. MANGROVE ECOSYSTEM MODEL / 59 SEA GRASSES, CORAL REEFS, AND MANGROVES A common topographical feature of Asian ocean areas are the enclosed coastal seas dominated by two highly productive ecosystems [1, 10], sea grass beds and mangrove forests. The strategic coastal position of these ecosystems makes them highly vulnerable to natural and man-made stresses. In tropical latitudes, sea grass systems are found between mangroves and coral reefs. This topographical position ensures functionally strong interlinking with the adjacent ecosystems. Sea grass beds act as hydrodynamic barriers by creating a low energy zone favorable to the mangrove forests. The beds prevent abrasion and burial of the ""breathing"" mechanisms of the mangroves by trapping and thereby stabilizing the sediments. Otherwise, these sediments would smother the sea grasses. In this way they also regulate fresh water flow and buffer salinity changes that may be unfavorable to plant growth. Tropical sea grasses are concentrated in two large areas: the Indoâ€”West Pacific, where all seven characteristically tropical species occur, viz. Enhalus, Thalassia, Halophila, Halodule, Syringodium, Cymodocea, and Thalassodendron; and the Caribbean and the Pacific Coast of Central America, which also has Halodule, Syringodium, Thalassia, Halophila, and other species. Although the number of sea grass species is small, their number belies their ecological and economic importance. Their significance accrues largely because of their quantities. They form dense beds which cover large areas of coastal waters and perform a wide spectrum of biophysical functions in the marine environment. They stabilize the substrate, produce sediments, and serve as habitats, nurseries, and primary food sources for fish, many invertebrates, turtles, and dugongs. They also provide alternative feeding sites for commercial and forage organisms. Because of their strategic position between coral reefs and mangroves, tropical sea grass beds act as effective buffers, reducing wave energy and exporting nutrients to nearby ecosystems. Mangroves thrive best where tidal regime is normal and amplitude is sigÂ­ nificant, mixing sea waters with fresh water from land run-off. They comprise a functional grouping of intertidal biota dominated by evergreen broad-leaved trees that remain partly submerged. Their main ecological roles are: 1. promoting soil formation by trapping debris, 2. filtering land run-off and removing terrestrial organic matter, 3. providing habitat for many fish and bird species, and 4. enhancing offshore productivity generally. Natural stresses to the vegetation take the form of tropical cyclones, typhoons, tidal waves, volcanic activity, pests, and diseases. Human-induced stresses come from mining, felling of trees, road construction, and dumping of waste materials. 60 / PANDEY AND KHANNA PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND NUTRIENT CYCLING IN MANGROVE ECOSYSTEMS Mangroves exhibit a type G* photosynthesis path [3]. They minimize water loss by opening of stornata wide only in the early hours of the day. The presence of trichomes and thick cuticles also check and control the water loss. Most of the nutrients flowing into mangroves have terrestrial origin. The growth and vigor of mangrove stands is highest in riverine conditions where detritus accumulation is low. For example, red mangroves exposed to riverine inputs exhibit rates of photosynthesis which are nearly twice as high as those of white mangroves [7]. A wide variety of plant-waste-material enters the soil and water of mangrove ecosystems. This helps establish a mixed heterogeneous microflora which keeps interacting with the organic constituents of plants. Decaying dead tissues are transformed into a vast heterogeneous group of carbon compounds. Nitrogen enters the mangrove through 1) rainfall and fresh water run-off from surrounding land forests and from rivers, 2) agricultural land drainage, sewage, and industrial effluents, and 3) decomposition of organic matter. Phosphorus is second only to nitrogen as an inorganic nutrient required by both plants and microorganisms, and is essential to the accumulation and release of energy. As is ever evident from the smell of H2S and the formation of black sulfides in the mangrove region, sulfur cycling is one of the important processes that take place in mangrove ecosystems. This mainly involves the following principal steps: 1) alter the solubility of organic phosphorus compounds, 2) mineralize organic compounds with the release of organic phosphate, and 3) oxidize or reduce inorganic phosphorus compounds. MODEL APPLICATION AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Gross photosynthesis of mangrove ecosystems is sensitive primarily to terÂ­ restrial inputs of nutrients. Zonation and vigor are functions of nutrient availÂ­ ability and salinity. During periods of succession, mangrove ecosystems signifiÂ­ cantly control and regulate the flow of nutrients to adjacent ecosystems. The storage of organic detritus in the forest and its export to adjacent zones is a function of tidal amplitude. Tides do not seem to affect gross photosynthetic rates significantly. Mangrove forests appear to reach a steady state, with respect to their biomass, almost in phase with the frequency of tropical hurricanes in the regions where they occur. As noted, mangroves protect coastal areas during high tides and storms, export organic matter to adjacent waters, and function as nursery grounds for commercially important fish and shrimp species [11]. This mangrove-dependent commercial development creates several socioeconomic conflicts. In order to assess tradeoffs and management alternatives, MANGROVE ECOSYSTEM MODEL / 61 ecosystem analysis and computer simulation modeling are valuable tools. A three-compartment non-linear model developed in [7], with mangrove biomass, detritus, and nutrient concentrations as state variables, is extended to evaluate the impacts of terrestrial run-",1997,Journal of Environmental Systems
A Neural Network basedReinforcement Learning Controller for Automatic Generation Control,"It hasbeenproposedrecently that the control policy for Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of an interconnectedpower systemcan be learnt thr ough a Reinforcement Ler aning (RL) approach [7]. In this method, which is the first application of RL techniquesfor power system control problems,it wasassumedthat the input variables to an AGC take only discretevalues. However, in a power system,quantiti esof interest for an AGC suchasACE, fr equency deviati on etc. areall continuousvari ables. In this paper, the earlier RL approach is extended to take care of the case of continuous state variables. We proposea Radial BasisFunction (RBF) neural network to represent the control policy and proposea learning algorithm so that optimal control law for the AGC can be learnt thr ough a traini ng phase.The RL approach to AGC designdoesnot needany information regarding power systemmodel and it is simple to implement. It is shown thr oughsimulationsthat this newAGC performs aswell asor better than other existing methods. Keywordsâ€”Power SystemControl, AGC, ReinforcementLearning, RBF Neural Networks. I .

AGC function can be viewedasa supervisory control function which attemptsto matchthe generation trendwithin an area,to the trendof the randomly changing load of the area,so as to keepthe system frequency andtie line powerflow closeto scheduledvalues. Therehasbeenconsiderableresearchwork proposingtheapplication of conceptsof modern control theory for the AGC problem [1], [2], [3]. In the recentpast,application of Neural Network basedcontrol [4], [5] andFuzzyControl [6] have alsobeenproposed. Theindustryview appears to bethatthesemethodsarewanting dueto oneor more of thefollowing considerations:not recognizing the fact that AGC actsat a slower time scale;useof highly simplified linear modelsand useof the turbine gener ator model to represen t the areadynamics; inability to handle the constraintsdue to physical limitations of the subsystems; choiceof impractical objectives suchas achieving zero ACE, veryquickresponse, etc. Wehaveproposedrecently[7], [8] thattheAGCproblemcan be viewed asa stochasticmultistagedecisionmakingproblem or a Markov ChainControl Problem, andhave presentedalgorithmsfor designing AGCbasedonthesocalledReinforcement Learning (RL) approach [9], [10].

The algorithmfor training the RBF network is given in sectionIV. Simulationresultsaregiven in sectionV, andpaper is concludedin sectionVI. I I . RL BASED AGC DESIGN In theRL approach,theAGC function is viewedasfollows. At eachinstant, k, k=1,2,.. . , the AGC observes the current â€˜stateâ€™ of the system, , (which in the implementation describedhereis , the averaged value of ACE at ) and takesan â€˜actionâ€™, . Thepossibleactionsof theAGC arethe various valuesof , thechangethatcanbemadein thegenerationlevel within anAGCinterval. Let denote thesetof all possiblestates,andlet denotethesetof all possibleactions. Within this formulation, any AGC algorithm is a mapping from thesetof states, , to thesetof actions, . We call any suchmapping,apolicy. If theAGCis following apolicy , then denotesactiontakenby AGConobserving state . In our earlierwork [7], [8], we have assumedthat thesetof all states, , andthe setof all actions arefinite. Sinceactionsof AGC arethepossiblevaluesof , it is reasonab le to quantize the actionspace.However, assumingthat is finite implies that we needto quantizethe valuesof various quantities that constitutethe stateinformation of AGC. In the AGC problem, thevariablessuchasACE arecontinuousandit may bedifficult to comeup with a proper quantization. Findingappropriate quantization could turn out to be a problem in itself. Hence,it is desirable to evolveamethodof designing RL based AGC without quantizing thestatespace. Learning a â€˜goodâ€™ policy (that is, a goodAGC) involves obtaining a mapping from to so that the objective of keeping ACE within a smallbandaround zerois achieved. We call sucha mapping an optimal policy, . To obtain , we use an iterative algorithm which is basedon Q-learning [9]. This involveslearning thesocalledoptimalQ-valuesor state-action valuesfor all state-actionpairs(which is denotedas ). The optimal policy canbe obtainedfrom usingthe relation !

Adaptive Generalized Fused-Lasso: Asymptotic Properties and Applications,"The Lasso has been widely studied and used in many applications over the last decade. It has also been extended in various directions in particular to ensure asymptotic oracle properties through adaptive weights (Zou, 2006). Another direction has been to incorporate additional knowledge within the penalty to account for some structure among features. Among such strategies the Fused-Lasso (Tibshirani et al., 2005) has recently been extended to penalize differences of coefficients corresponding to features organized along a network, through the Generalized Fused-Lasso. In this work we investigate the theoretical and empirical properties of the Adaptive Generalized Fused-Lasso in the context of Generalized Linear Models, with emphasis on Logistic Regression. More precisely, we establish its asymptotic oracle properties and propose an extensive simulation study to explore its empirical properties. We especially show that it compares favorably with other strategies. We also propose an adaptation of the Relaxed Lasso (Meinshausen, 2007). Finally we present an original application of the Generalized Fused-Lasso to the Joint Modeling framework where the design itself suggests the graph to be used in the penalty; an illustration is provided on road safety data.",2013,
Regularized joint estimation of related vector autoregressive models,"In a number of applications, one has access to high-dimensional time series data on several related subjects. A motivating application area comes from the neuroimaging field, such as brain fMRI time series data, obtained from various groups of subjects (cases/controls) with a specific neurological disorder. The problem of regularized joint estimation of multiple related Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models is discussed, leveraging a group lasso penalty in addition to a regular lasso one, so as to increase statistical efficiency of the estimates by borrowing strength across the models. A modeling framework is developed that it allows for both group-level and subject-specific effects for related subjects, using a group lasso penalty to estimate the former. An estimation procedure is introduced, whose performance is illustrated on synthetic data and compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed approach is employed for the analysis of resting state fMRI data. In particular, a group-level descriptive analysis is conducted for brain inter-regional temporal effects of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) patients as opposed to controls, with the data available from the ADHD-200 Global Competition repository.",2019,Computational statistics & data analysis
"Genetic and Biochemical Characterization of VMB-1, a Novel Metallo-Î²-Lactamase Encoded by a Conjugative, Broad-Host Range IncC Plasmid from Vibrio spp.","The increasing incidence of phenotypic resistance to carbapenems in recent years is mainly attributed to acquisition of mobile carbapenemase-encoding genetic elements by major bacterial pathogens. Here, a novel carbapenemase known as Vibrio metallo-Î²-lactamase 1 (VMB-1), which is encoded by a gene (blaVMB-1 ) located in an integron-bearing, highly transmissible IncC type plasmid, namely pVB1796, is identified and characterized, both genetically and functionally. Recovered from a foodborne Vibrio alginolyticus strain that exhibits resistance to all known Î²-lactam antibiotics, pVB1796 is found to possess a hybrid backbone that exhibits unique features of both type 1 and type 2 IncC elements. VMB-1 exhibits 94% sequence homology with several recently reported but poorly characterized metallo-Î²-lactamases (MBLs) produced by the marine organisms Alteromonadaceae, Glaciecola, and Thalassomonas actiniarum. Sequence alignment analysis shows that VMB-1 shares a structurally identical active site with subclass B1 MBLs. Importantly, pVB1796 is found to be efficiently transferred from Vibrio to other Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, including Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumanni, via conjugation. These findings suggest that blaVMB-1 -bearing plasmids have the potential to be disseminated to other Gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the near future and render carbapenems useless in treatment of multidrug resistant infections.",2020,Advanced biosystems
Postsettlement survival linked to larval life in a marine fish.,"There is a growing realization that the scale and degree of population connectivity are crucial to the dynamics and persistence of spatially structured populations. For marine organisms with complex life cycles, experiences during larval life may influence phenotypic traits, performance, and the probability of postsettlement survival. For a Caribbean reef fish (Thalassoma bifasciatum) on an oceanic island, we used otolith (ear stone) elemental profiles of lead (Pb) to assign recent settlers to a group that developed in waters elevated in Pb concentrations throughout larval life (i.e., nearshore signature) and a group that developed in waters depleted in Pb (i.e., offshore signature), potentially dispersing from upstream sources across oceanic waters. Larval history influenced early life history traits: offshore developers initially grew slowly but compensated with fast growth upon entering nearshore waters and metamorphosed in better condition with higher energy reserves. As shown in previous studies, local production contributed heavily to settlement: at least 45% of settlers developed nearshore. However, only 23% of survivors after the first month displayed a nearshore otolith profile. Therefore, settlers with different larval histories suffered differential mortality. Importantly, selective mortality was mediated by larval history, in that the postsettlement intensity of selection was much greater for fish that developed nearshore, potentially because they had developed in a less selectively intense larval environment. Given the potential for asymmetrical postsettlement source-based survival, successful spatial management of marine populations may require knowledge of ""realized connectivity"" on ecological scales, which takes into account the postsettlement fitness of individuals from different sources.",2008,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Process induced shape distortions of self-reinforced poly ( ethylene terephthalate ) composites,"This paper investigates shape distortion and tensile properties of hot consolidated Self-reinforced poly(ethylene terephthalate) (SrPET) by evaluating the influence from stretching before consolidation and annealing after consolidation. Spring-in angle and warpage is measured from V-shaped samples that are hot consolidated from a woven fabric that is stretched to different degrees during forming. Following the same process conditions, tensile stiffness is measured from plane laminates. This study confirms that stretching the SrPET-material during forming enhances the tensile modulus but introduces shape distortions with negative spring-in and increases warpage. However also non-stretched SrPET components experience spring-back in the same level as glassor carbon reinforced PET composite, which is unexpected. The tensile modulus is reduced and spring-in angle further influenced when the SrPET-samples are exposed to higher temperature after consolidation. This study shows how easily the characteristics of a component made from SrPET-material are influenced by stresses developed during material forming and further by release of these stresses when exposed to higher temperatures as in post processes or even in the use phase of the component.",2018,
DeepCropNet: a deep spatial-temporal learning framework for county-level corn yield estimation,"Large-scale crop yield estimation is critical for understanding the dynamics of global food security. Understanding and quantifying the temporal cumulative effect of crop growth and spatial variances across different regions remains challenging for large-scale crop yield estimation. In this study, a deep spatial-temporal learning framework, named DeepCropNet (DCN), has been developed to hierarchically capture the features for county-level corn yield estimation. The temporal features are learned by an attention-based Long Short-term Memory network and the spatial features are learned by the multi-task learning output layers. The DCN model has been applied to quantify the relationship between meteorological factors and the county-level corn yield in the U.S. Corn Belt from 1981 to 2016. Three meteorological factors, including growing degree days, killing degree days, and precipitation, are used as time-series inputs. The results show that DCN provides an improved estimation accuracy (RMSE = 0.82 Mg ha-1) as compared to that of conventional methods such as LASSO (RMSE = 1.14 Mg ha-1) and Random Forest (RMSE = 1.05 Mg ha-1). Temporally, the attention values computed from the temporal learning module indicate that DCN captures the temporal cumulative effect and this temporal pattern is consistent across all states. Spatially, the spatial learning module improves the estimation accuracy based on the regional specific features captured by the multi-task learning mechanism. The study highlights that the DeepCropNet model provides a promising spatial-temporal learning framework for corn yield estimation under changing meteorological conditions across large spatial regions.",2020,Environmental Research Letters
Enhancing the feature representation of multi-modal MRI data by combining multi-view information for MCI classification,"Abstract The classification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is a early stage of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and is associated with brain structural and functional changes, is still a challenging task. Recent studies have shown great promise for improving the performance of MCI classification by combining multiple structural and functional features, such as grey matter volume and clustering coefficient. However, extracting which features and how to combine multiple features to improve the performance of MCI classification have always been challenging problems. To address these problems, in this study we propose a new method to enhance the feature representation of multi-modal MRI data by combining multi-view information to improve the performance of MCI classification. Firstly, we extract two structural features (including grey matter volume and cortical thickness) and two functional features (including clustering coefficient and shortest path length) of each cortical brain region based on automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas from both T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data of each subject. Then, in order to obtain features that are more helpful in distinguishing MCI subjects, an improved multi-task feature selection method, namely MTFS-gLASSO-TTR, is proposed. Finally, a multi-kernel learning algorithm is adopted to combine multiple features to perform the MCI classification task. Our proposed MCI classification method is evaluated on 315 subjects (including 105 LMCI subjects, 105 EMCI subjects and 105 NCs) with both T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.5% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.897 for LMCI/NC classification, an accuracy of 82.7% and an AUC of 0.832 for EMCI/NC classification, and an accuracy of 79.6% and an AUC of 0.803 for LMCI/EMCI classification, respectively. In addition, by comparison, the accuracy and AUC values of our proposed method are better than those of some existing state-of-the-art methods in MCI classification. Overall, our proposed MCI classification method is effective and promising for automatic diagnosis of MCI in clinical practice.",2020,Neurocomputing
Identification of a 26-lncRNAs Risk Model for Predicting Overall Survival of Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma Based on Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.,"As a common malignancy in women, cervical squamous cell carcinoma is a major cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Recent studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) can function as potential biomarkers in cancer prognosis; however, little is known about its role in cervical cancer. In this study, we downloaded the gene expression profiles along with the clinical data of patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas. By applying bioinformatics analysis including random forest selection and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) cox regression model along with 10-fold cross-validation, we constructed a 26-lncRNAs risk model that can be used to predict the overall survival of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. After that, Kaplan-Meier analysis combined with log-rank p test was applied to assess the predictive accuracy of the 26-lncRNAs risk model. Further analysis showed that the prognostic value of 26-lncRNAs risk model was independent of other clinicopathological factors. At last, lncRNAs in the model were put into gene ontology biological process enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathways analysis, which suggested that these lncRNAs might contribute to cancer-associated processes such as cell cycle and apoptosis. This study indicated that lncRNAs signature could be a useful marker to predict the prognosis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma.",2019,DNA and cell biology
Mining the WHO Drug Safety Database Using Lasso Logistic Regression,"For reasons such as low incidence, occurrence in groups frequently excluded from clinical trials and long onset times, some adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of a new medicinal product stay unnoticed until after market launch. The World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) continuously collect spontaneous ADR reports from the entire world and use data mining approaches to detect which drugs are most likely to cause which previously unanticipated ADRs. This WHO drug safety database, being the largest of its kind, comprises about 3.8 million accumulated reports. The currently used data mining methods are based on two-dimensional projections of the data with respect to a given drug-ADR combination. This combination is then given an association score based on the discrepancy between the observed and expected number of reports on it. In this thesis these disproportionality-based methods are represented by the information component (IC) measure of the UMC, a shrunk Bayesian measure. A limitation with the IC is its incapability to deal with confounding by co-medication and masking. Confounding by co-medication means that the association between a drug and a certain ADR might seem stronger than it really is because that drug is used together with another drug, which in turn is truly associated with the ADR. Masking, on the other hand, is a phenomenon whereby a very strong association between an ADR and some drug might weaken the associations between that ADR and other drugs. Here a novel method to mine the WHO drug safety database is proposed to address these issues, the lasso logistic regression (LLR). Instead of studying each combination separately, in the LLR model the ADR under study is fixed and its presence on a report is predicted by the presence of all occurring drugs in the database, thus yielding a logistic regression framework. Further, independent prior Laplace distributions are put on the parameters, resulting in a lasso-type shrinkage where a subset of the parameters are shrunk to exactly zero. The LLR was confirmed to correct for confounding by co-medication and masking in simulated scenarios and specific clinical examples. Further, with a specific degree of shrinkage the LLR had 10 % higher recall and maintained precision in comparison to the IC with respect to a test database. Although its transparency is limited, the LLR has an important role to play in the future of ADR monitoring.",2007,
Identification of Lasso Peptide Topologies Using Native Nanoelectrospray Ionization-Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry.,"Lasso peptides are a fascinating class of bioactive ribosomal natural products characterized by a mechanically interlocked topology. In contrast to their branched-cyclic forms, lasso peptides have higher stability and have become a scaffold for drug development. However, the identification and separation of lasso peptides from their unthreaded topoisomers (branched-cyclic peptides) is analytically challenging since the higher stability is based solely on differences in their tertiary structures. In the present work, a fast and effective workflow is proposed for the separation and identification of lasso from branched cyclic peptides based on differences in their mobility space under native nanoelectrospray ionization-trapped ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (nESI-TIMS-MS). The high mobility resolving power ( R) of TIMS resulted in the separation of lasso and branched-cyclic topoisomers ( R up to 250, 150 needed on average). The advantages of alkali metalation reagents (e.g., Na, K, and Cs salts) as a way to increase the analytical power of TIMS is demonstrated for topoisomers with similar mobilities as protonated species, efficiently turning the metal ion adduction into additional separation dimensions.",2018,Analytical chemistry

Fine structure of Classopollis exines,"Serial sections for light microscopy or transmission electron microscopy of two Classopollis pollen tetrads show that the exine structure, except for the nexine, has radially arranged rodlike units interwoven with transverse subunits. The nexine consists of strands or thin sheets except in the equatorial infratectal striate band area, where it is up to ca. 1â€‚Î¼m thick. Nexine is absent in the areas of the distal cryptopore and the subequatorial circumpolar infratectal canal. It is very thin or absent in the tetrad scar. Native contrast and reactivity to stain disappeared on immersion of thin sections in 1â€‚M NaOH or HCl or in water. Reactivity to stains was regained after oxidizing the sections in KMnO4. Reactivity to stains appears to be dependent upon non-sporopollenin molecules embedded within exines. The above immersions remove stain reactive sites.

Clustering in linear-mixed models with a group fused lasso penalty.,"A method is proposed that aims at identifying clusters of individuals that show similar patterns when observed repeatedly. We consider linear-mixed models that are widely used for the modeling of longitudinal data. In contrast to the classical assumption of a normal distribution for the random effects a finite mixture of normal distributions is assumed. Typically, the number of mixture components is unknown and has to be chosen, ideally by data driven tools. For this purpose, an EM algorithm-based approach is considered that uses a penalized normal mixture as random effects distribution. The penalty term shrinks the pairwise distances of cluster centers based on the group lasso and the fused lasso method. The effect is that individuals with similar time trends are merged into the same cluster. The strength of regularization is determined by one penalization parameter. For finding the optimal penalization parameter a new model choice criterion is proposed.",2014,Biometrical journal. Biometrische Zeitschrift
A note on the group lasso and a sparse group lasso,"We consider the group lasso penalty for the linear model. We note that the standard algorithm for solving the problem assumes that the model matrices in each group are orthonormal. Here we consider a more general penalty that blends the lasso (L1) with the group lasso (\two-norm""). This penalty yields solutions that are sparse at both the group and individual feature levels. We derive an ecien t algorithm for the resulting convex problem based on coordinate descent. This algorithm can also be used to solve the general form of the group lasso, with non-orthonormal model matrices.",2010,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Weighted composite quantile regression estimation and variable selection for varying coefficient models with heteroscedasticity,"Abstract In this paper, we propose a data-driven penalized weighted composite quantile regression estimation for varying coefficient models with heteroscedasticity, which results in sparse and robust estimators simultaneously. With local weighted composite quantile regression smoothing and adaptive group LASSO, the new method can identify the true model and estimate the coefficient functions and heteroscedasticity simultaneously. The resulting estimators can be as efficient as the oracle estimators by using the SIC criterion to select the tuning parameters. In addition, we revise a mistake of Theorem 2 in Guo, Tian, and Zhu (2012). The finite sample performance of the newly proposed method is investigated through simulation studies and a real data example.",2015,Journal of The Korean Statistical Society
La polÃ­tica en Twitter. Un estudio comparativo de las estrategias discursivas de los candidatos finalistas a la Presidencia de Ecuador en 2017,"The Social media have become spaces for electoral promotion and propaganda that attract the political class because of its capacity to amplify discourses, the possibility of arriving with messages to increasingly heterogeneous social groups and, obviously, by reducing costs for the production and dissemination of communication material. In this context, the present study seeks to contrast the discursive strategies used, on Twitter, by Lenin Moreno and Guillermo Lasso, finalist candidates in the Ecuadorian presidential elections of 2017, with two specific objectives: on the one hand, to identify the social, symbolic and ideological that are part of the tactics for the mobilization of emotions in the electorate and, on the other hand, to establish the priority publics to which they are directed through the social environment. The methodology considered the content analysis, both of his discourse and cultural artifacts at the audiovisual level. From a qualitative practice and its hermeneutical relationship, we concentrate on the discursive description to decipher the meanings after the words. The discussion focuses on the political discourse crystallizing using personalization strategies based on consumable narratives, but of rapid expiration and it is also observed that the most recurrent tactic is the construction of ideological enemies, rather than personal ones.",2018,"adComunica.

Numerical and experimental analysis of stress behavior of plasma-sprayed Bioglass on titanium,"Numerical and Experimental Analysis of Stress Behavior of Plasma-Sprayed Bioglasso on Titanium Hyuen Me (Mia) Park Oregon Graduate Institute of Science & Technology, 1996 Supervising Professor: Lemmy Meekisho, PhD Due to the constantly growing number of total joint arthroplasty patients, the demand for improvements in the design of implant &cation has become more apparent. One method of implant fixation involves the use of a porous metal prosthetic that has been coated with a bioactive ceramic such as BioglassQ. This ceramic coating acts to initiate early bone infiltration into the porous surface provided by the implant. Once osseointegration has occurred, the implant is securely fixed within the host bone of the patient. Analysis of the integrity of the plasma-sprayed bioceramic.on a titanium alloy (Ti6AI-4V) was the focus of this study. Both numerical and experimental components were used to investigate the bond strength of BioglassQ-coatings on Ti-6Al-4V. The physical specimen consisted of a Ti-6Al-4V cylinder which was plasmasprayed with BioglassGO (BG) on one of its flat surfaces. This BG surface was adhered to another Co-Cr-Mo mushroom cap with an epoxy adhesive. The titanium alloy cylinder was 25.4mrn in diameter and 12.7rnm in length. A 150pm thick coating was applied onto the flat surface of the titanium cylinder. The test samples were pulled in tension at a rate of 0. linlmin until complete failure occurred. F i t e element analysis (FEA), being a widely accepted method of analyzing or simulating a variety of engineering stress, strain, and failure problems, was used in this study. Specifically, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) FEA models were developed to evaluate the stresdstrain distributions at a bimaterial interface of a tensile test specimen. Dimensions of the FEA models (AnsysS.2 [I]) were identical to those of the experimental specimens. The heights of the Ti-6A1-4V pieces, however, were reduced strategically to minimize the overall problem size in order to focus on detail analysis of the domain in the neighborhood of the interface. Elements capable of linear strain were used in the models. A linear-elastic solution was chosen with the knowledge that BG does not exhibit plastic deformation. The material properties of interest were Young's modulus (E) and Poisson's ratio (u) [2-91. Necessary and sufficient boundary conditions were applied in the FEA model so as to accurately represent the physical problem. Specifically, the boundary conditions would simulate appropriate lateral shrinkage of the specimen as it elongates under the action of the applied tensile load. The tensile load was applied as a uniform tensile pressure. While various pressure loads were applied, only results obtained fiom a pressure level of 30MPa will be presented. This is for purposes of consistency with data reported in the literature. The tensile tests showed that weaker bond strengths exist with the porous specimens. Bond strengths for both porous and smooth samples were inversely proportional to the BG coating. The maximum bond strength was observed with the smooth coupon group having the lowest BG thickness. The FEA models yielded a singular stress field at the free-edge interface corners of the biaterial. These high stresses suggest that the corners could be the location of failure initiation. That the singular stress fields were found to be at the fiee edge interface comers was consistent with expectation. The equivalent von Mises stress was used in assessing the stress-strain response of the specimen since it gives an overall more realistic picture of the state of deformation [lo]. The von Mises stresses for the FEA study revealed slightly higher stresses along the interface in comparison to the rest of the model. In addition, the equivalent stresses resulted in having 45"" ""wings"" of high stresses which protrude fiom the fiee edge into the titanium blocks. These high stress wings were oriented along the slip directions for metal [lo, 1 11 subjected to a tensile load. The highest strains appeared in the center region of the BG layer which was exp'ected since BG has the lower value of Young's modulus. The deformation fields observed were in accordance with expectations, namely the longitudinal elongation and lateral shrinkage of the specimen. Chern Lin et al[6] performed a similar study where plasma-sprayed BG coatings were subjected to tension for delamination. Fractures were observed to occur within the coatings and only some of the coating was separated fiom the substrate while the majority still remained tightly bonded to the substrate. Since most of the failures occurred within the coatings themselves, the actual bond strengths should be higher than those measured. The von Mises stresses show that failure would occur initially at the fiee-edge interface and propagate along the Ti-6Al-4VlBG interface. This diiers fiom the experimental observations in that the BG did not completely delaminate fiom the substrate. Many areas on the substrate surface were still covered by BG. The FEA evaluation was made on the assumptions that the materials were isotropic, homogeneous, and fiee of rnicrovoids. The 45"" stress zones are generally observed in metals due to their ductility and corresponding slip system characteristics. These oblique stress zones may be interpreted as resolved shear stresses which developed during the lateral contraction of the specimen experienced under tensile loading [l 11.",1996,
Arthroscopic centralization of an extruded lateral meniscus.,"Extrusion of the lateral meniscus has been reported after posterior root tear or radial tear, partial meniscectomy, and meniscoplasty of discoid meniscus. It has also been shown to be associated with the development of osteoarthritis. This technical note describes a new arthroscopic technique to centralize and stabilize the mid body of the lateral meniscus to restore and maintain the lateral meniscus function by repairing/preventing extrusion of the meniscus. A JuggerKnot Soft Anchor (Biomet, Warsaw, IN), loaded with a MaxBraid suture (Biomet), was placed on the lateral edge of the lateral tibial plateau, just anterior to the popliteal hiatus, through a midlateral portal. A Micro Suture Lasso Small Curve with Nitinol Wire Loop (Arthrex, Naples, FL) was used to pass 2 limbs of the MaxBraid suture through the meniscus at the margin between the meniscus and the capsule. Another anchor was inserted on the lateral edge of the lateral tibial plateau, 1 cm anterior to the first anchor, and the same procedure was repeated. The sutures were then tied by use of a self-locking sliding knot, achieving centralization and secure stabilization of the lateral meniscus.",2012,Arthroscopy techniques
Time series analysis method based on ordered lasso,"When doing data mining on high dimensional,complex,and changeable data,it is necessary to reduce the dimension of primal data at first. Traditional lasso method is widely used for reducing the dimensionality and classification because of the sparsity of its solution and the stability of variable selection. However,when dealing with time-series data,it doesn' t consider temporal relations of variables,so its application is limited. Given this shortcoming,ordered lasso of handling time-series data is proposed in this paper. The input variables of ordered lasso are the different time points according to different predictors. For each predictor,the ordered lasso can estimate the best suitable time-lag interval. The advantage of ordered lasso in recovering real coefficients is that it can eliminate the fluctuations in the tails. Experimental results on real time-series data have proved ordered lasso method is feasible.",2015,Journal of Yanshan University
"Development and Validation of a Novel Signature to Predict Overall Survival in ""Driver Gene-negative"" Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD): Results of a Multicenter Study.","PURPOSE
Examining the role of developmental signaling pathways in ""driver gene-negative"" lung adenocarcinoma (patients with lung adenocarcinoma negative for EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, HER2, MET, ALK, RET, and ROS1 were identified as ""driver gene-negative"") may shed light on the clinical research and treatment for this lung adenocarcinoma subgroup. We aimed to investigate whether developmental signaling pathways activation can stratify the risk of ""driver gene-negative"" lung adenocarcinoma.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
In the discovery phase, we profiled the mRNA expression of each candidate gene using genome-wide microarrays in 52 paired lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal tissues. In the training phase, tissue microarrays and LASSO Cox regression analysis were applied to further screen candidate molecules in 189 patients, and we developed a predictive signature. In the validation phase, one internal cohort and two external cohorts were used to validate our novel prognostic signature.


RESULTS
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis based on whole-genome microarrays indicated that the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway was activated in ""driver gene-negative"" lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway-based gene expression profiles revealed 39 transcripts differentially expressed. Finally, a Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway-based CSDW signature comprising 4 genes (CTNNB1 or Î²-catenin, SOX9, DVL3, and Wnt2b) was developed to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups in the training cohort. Patients with high-risk scores in the training cohort had shorter overall survival [HR, 10.42; 6.46-16.79; P < 0.001) than patients with low-risk scores.


CONCLUSIONS
The CSDW signature is a reliable prognostic tool and may represent genes that are potential drug targets for ""driver gene-negative"" lung adenocarcinoma.",2019,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research

And a higher percentage of LVQ accuracy with 100% accuracy while Kohonen percentage 50%.",2015,
Constructing confidence sets after lasso selection by randomized estimator augmentation,"Although a few methods have been developed recently for building confidence intervals after model selection, how to construct confidence sets for joint post-selection inference is still an open question. In this paper, we develop a new method to construct confidence sets after lasso variable selection, with strong numerical support for its accuracy and effectiveness. A key component of our method is to sample from the conditional distribution of the response $y$ given the lasso active set, which, in general, is very challenging due to the tiny probability of the conditioning event. We overcome this technical difficulty by using estimator augmentation to simulate from this conditional distribution via Markov chain Monte Carlo given any estimate $\tilde{\mu}$ of the mean $\mu_0$ of $y$. We then incorporate a randomization step for the estimate $\tilde{\mu}$ in our sampling procedure, which may be interpreted as simulating from a posterior predictive distribution by averaging over the uncertainty in $\mu_0$. Our Monte Carlo samples offer great flexibility in the construction of confidence sets for multiple parameters. Extensive numerical results show that our method is able to construct confidence sets with the desired coverage rate and, moreover, that the diameter and volume of our confidence sets are substantially smaller in comparison with a state-of-the-art method.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Simultaneous Coverage : It also makes sense to talk about events that are defined simultaneously over all j âˆˆ,"We develop a general approach to valid inference after model selection. In a nutshell, our approach produces post-selection inferences with the same frequency guarantees as those given by data splitting but are more powerful. At the core of our framework is a result that characterizes the distribution of a post-selection estimator conditioned on the selection event. We specialize the approach to model selection by the lasso to form valid confidence intervals for the selected coefficients and test whether all relevant variables have been included in the model.",2015,
Oncogenic Predictors of Outcome in Older AML Patients Treated Intensively. Analysis of the ALFA-1200 Trial,"Context. The prognostic value of gene mutations in older AML patients (pts) treated intensively remains unclear. Only one study has explored the role of mutation patterns determined by NGS in older AML pts prospectively treated with various chemotherapies in years 2000-2010 (Eisfeld Leukemia 2018). Methods. Pts older than 60y enrolled in the ALFA-1200 trial (NCT01966497) between 09/2012 and 06/2016 were sequenced with a 37-gene myeloid panel. Pts received one 7+3 course followed by 2 intermediate-dose cytarabine courses. Pts with non-favorable risk were eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Variable selection for multivariate analyses was performed by lasso penalized regression including age, gender and log(WBC) as covariates. Results. Sequencing was done in 471 (93%) of the 509 enrolled pts. Median age and WBC count were 68y and 5.3x109/L, respectively (resp). CR (including CRp) was achieved in 341 (72%) pts and 90 underwent RIC-SCT in first CR. With a median follow-up of 25.4 months, median OS was 20.7 months. Pts had a median of 3 mutations (range 1-10). The 17 mostly frequently mutated genes (â‰¥5% of pts, by decreasing frequency: DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, ASXL1, FLT3, SRSF2, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS, IDH1, STAG2, BCOR, TP53, PTPN11, U2AF1, EZH2 and KRAS) were retained for prognostic analyses. Genes belonging to a common pathway (eg. NRAS and KRAS) may have divergent prognostic values, preventing biology-informed grouping of mutations. Cytogenetic risk (derived from ELN 2017, Dohner Blood 2017, not considering gene mutations) was favorable (fav), intermediate (int), adverse (adv) and missing in 3%, 72%, 18% and 7% resp. Because of the few pts with fav cytogenetics in our cohort, pts were further grouped into non-adv and adv cytogenetics. CR rates and median OS were 75.6% vs 56.6% and 24.8 vs 9.5 months in pts with non-adv and adv cytogenetics, resp (both p In the 388 pts with non-adv cytogenetics, NPM1 mutations independently predicted improved CR rate (Odds Ratio [OR]=2.3, p=0.014), while mutations in ASXL1 (OR=0.46, p=0.012), RUNX1 (OR=0.46, p=0.013) and NRAS (OR=0.49, p=0.04) had independent adverse predictive value. In univariate analysis the shorter OS of FLT3-ITD pts was confined to allele ratiosâ‰¥ 0.5 (FLT3-ITDhigh, p=0.02). In a multivariate analysis accounting for clinical covariates, mutations in NPM1 (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.45, p In the 83 pts with adv cytogenetics, TP53 mutations predicted shorter OS (p=0.004). Among pts with adv cytogenetics, those without TP53 mutation had a median OS of 12.6 months and were thus classified as high risk while the median OS of the 30 pts with adv cytogenetics and TP53 mutations was only 5.4 months, defining very high risk disease. This stratification resulted in improved OS prediction compared to the full molecular ELN 2017 (C-index 0.63 vs 0.58, resp). This stratification also predicted Relapse-Free Survival (RFS, Figure, p Conclusion. In AML patients older than 60y treated intensively, mutations in 7 genes (NPM1, SRSF2, FLT3, DNMT3A, ASLX1, NRAS and TP53) can refine the prognosis of cytogenetic sub-groups.

Inflammatory markers in women with postpartum depressive symptoms.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a devastating disorder affecting not only more than 10% of all women giving birth, but also the baby, the family, and the society. Compiling evidence suggests the involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of major depression; yet, the immune response in perinatal depression is not as well studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the alterations in peripheral levels of inflammatory biomarkers in 169 Swedish women with and without depressive symptoms according to the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale or the M.I.N.I neuropsychiatric interview at eight weeks postpartum. Among the 70 markers analyzed with multiplex proximity extension assay, five were significantly elevated in women with postpartum depressive symptoms in the adjusted LASSO logistic regression analysis: Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member (TRANCE) (OR-per 1 SD increaseÂ =Â 1.20), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (ORÂ =Â 1.17) Interleukin (IL)-18 (ORÂ =Â 1.06), Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) (ORÂ =Â 1.25), and C-X-C motif chemokine 1 (CXCL1) (OR 1.11). These results indicate that women with PPD have elevated levels of some inflammatory biomarkers. It is, therefore, plausible that PPD is associated with a compromised adaptability of the immune system.",2018,Journal of neuroscience research
Degradation of selected pesticide active ingredients and commercial formulations in water by the photo-assisted Fenton reaction,"The destruction of pesticide active ingredients (AI) and commercial formulations in acidic aqueous solution with the catalytic photo-Fenton, Fe(III)/H2O2/UV, advanced oxidation process has been studied. The AI are alachlor, aldicarb, atrazine, azinphos-methyl, captan, carbofuran, dicamba, disulfoton, glyphosate, malathion, methoxylchlor, metolachlor, picloram and simazine. Complete loss of pure AI occurred in most cases in <30Â min under the following conditions: 5.0Ã—10âˆ’5Â M Fe(III), 1.0Ã—10âˆ’2Â M H2O2, T=25.0Â°C, pH 2.8 and 1.2Ã—1019Â quantaÂ lâˆ’1Â sâˆ’1 with fluorescent blacklight UV irradiation (300â€“400Â nm). Considerable mineralization over 120Â min occurred in most cases as evidenced by the appearance of inorganic ions and the decline in total organic carbon (TOC) of the solution. Intermediate products such as formate, acetate and oxalate appeared in early stages of degradation in some cases. Observed rate constants calculated from initial rates varied by a factor of <âˆ¼3. The commercial products, Furadan (AI, carbofuran), Lasso 4EC (AI, alachlor) and Lasso Microtech (AI, alachlor) were also tested. The â€œinert ingredientsâ€ (adjuvants) present in these products had no effect (Furadan), a slight effect (Lasso 4EC), or a strong effect (Lasso Microtech) on the rate of degradation of the AI. Lasso Microtech, in which the AI is micro-encapsulated in a polymeric shell wall microsphere, required slightly elevated temperatures to effect removal of alachlor in a timely manner. The results show that many pesticides and their commercial formulations in dilute aqueous solution are amenable to photo-Fenton treatment.",1999,Water Research
Minimizing Variable Selection Criteria by Markov Chain,"Regression models with a large number of predictors arise in diverse fields of social sciences and natural sciences. For their proper interpretation, we often would like to identify a smaller subset of the variables that shows the strongest information. In such large size of candidate predictors setting, one will encounter a computationally cumbersome search in practice by optimizing some criteria for selecting variables, such as AIC, Cp and BIC, over all possible subsets. Instead of the forward stepwise selection, backward stepwise selection or Lasso method, we present an efficient algorithm via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for searching the optimum value of the corresponding criterion. We will exhibit that our proposed MCMC algorithm obtains better solutions in terms of minimizing those criteria on simulated examples as well as a real data set.",2010,
Religious Immanence,"Abstract This paper offers a critical assessment of Meillassoux's attempt to articulate a â€œphilosophical divineâ€ based on, and consistent with, his radical ontology of contingency. The critical claim developed is that Meillassoux's conception of the divine is inconsistent with his wider commitment to immanence and that this is due to his uncritical endorsement of key evaluative and affective features of religions of the transcendent. This affinity is evident in his view that the phenomenon of â€œunjust deathâ€ generates a problem concerning the justification of a world thus characterised and in the solution proposed. The critical question regarding the compatibility of immanence and such a theodicy is explored. Further examples of Meillassoux's unacknowledged allegiance to the sensibility of transcendent religion are identified including his concern for â€œjusticeâ€ and â€œhumanityâ€ and persistent avowal of â€œGodâ€. An alternative conception of a religion of immanence is sketched which emphasises impersonality and a-moralism. This alternative, it is claimed, integrates more consistently than Meillassoux's the evaluative-affective and theoretical domains. On this basis the claim is advanced that Meillassoux misappropriates the considerable resources his ontology contains for the formulation of a religion of immanence.",2014,Angelaki
"Chimpanzees with positive welfare are happier, extraverted, and emotionally stable","Facilities housing captive animals are full of staff who, every day, interact with the animals under their care. The expertise and familiarity of staff can be used to monitor animal welfare by means of questionnaires. It was the goal of our study to examine the association between chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) welfare, happiness, and personality. To these ends we collected two waves of welfare and subjective well-being ratings of 18 chimpanzees housed at the Edinburgh Zoo and one set of ratings of 13 chimpanzees housed at Fundacio Mona. Ratings were made on a welfare questionnaire that included 12 items related to stress, psychological stimulation, and behavioural indicators of negative and positive welfare states, and a 4-item subjective well-being questionnaire. In addition, ratings were made on the 54-item Hominoid Personality Questionnaire and an abbreviated version of this scale consisting of 37 antonym pairs. We used generalizability theory to test whether welfare ratings generalized across items, raters, chimpanzees, and time. We then assessed the validity of the welfare and subjective well-being questionnaires by examining their associations with behaviour. Finally, we tested whether the welfare and subjective well-being ratings were associated with personality. Welfare ratings generalized across items, raters, chimpanzees, and time. Principal components analysis and regularized exploratory factor analysis indicated that ten welfare items and all four subjective well-being items formed a single dimension (welfareSWB). LASSO regression found that lower welfareSWB was associated with regurgitation, coprophagy, urophagy, and decreased proximity to nearest neighbour. A linear model that adjusted for age, sex, and facility, indicated that higher Extraversion and lower Neuroticism were related to higher welfareSWB. Welfare ratings were reliable and associated with subjective well-being and personality, demonstrating that staff ratings are a valid and potentially valuable tool for chimpanzee welfare assessment.",2017,Applied Animal Behaviour Science
"Determining the identity and roles of oil-metabolizing marine bacteria from the Thames estuary, UK.","Crude oil is a complex mixture of different hydrocarbons. While diverse bacterial communities can degrade oil, the specific roles of individual members within such communities remain unclear. To identify the key bacterial taxa involved in aerobic degradation of specific hydrocarbons, microcosm experiments were established using seawater from Stanford le Hope, Thames estuary, UK, adjacent to a major oil refinery. In all microcosms, hydrocarbon degradation was significant within 10 weeks, ranging from > 99% of low-molecular-weight alkanes (C(10)-C(18)), 41-84% of high-molecular-weight alkanes (C(20)-C(32)) and pristane, and 32-88% of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Analysis of 16S rRNA sequences from clone libraries and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) indicated that, except when incubated with fluorene, PAH-degrading communities were dominated by Cycloclasticus. Moreover, PAH-degrading communities were distinct from those in microcosms containing alkanes. Degradation of the branched alkane, pristane, was carried out almost exclusively by Alcanivorax. Bacteria related to Thalassolituus oleivorans (99-100% identity) were the dominant known alkane degraders in n-alkane (C(12)-C(32)) microcosms, while Roseobacter-related bacteria were also consistently found in these microcosms. However, in contrast to previous studies, Thalassolituus, rather than Alcanivorax, was dominant in crude oil-enriched microcosms. The communities in n-decane microcosms differed from those in microcosms supplemented with less volatile alkanes, with a phylogenetically distinct species of Thalassolituus out-competing T. oleivorans. These data suggest that the diversity and importance of the genus Thalassolituus is greater than previously established. Overall, these experiments demonstrate how degradation of different petroleum hydrocarbons is partitioned between different bacterial taxa, which together as a community can remediate petroleum hydrocarbon-impacted estuarine environments.",2007,Environmental microbiology
CS 224 W Final Report : Community Detection for Distributed Optimization,"Distributed optimization has a large range of applications that make use of massive amounts of data or require limited communication between computing nodes. Therefore, it is important to investigate efficient ways of performing distributed optimization. One of the more popular methods in this area is consensus optimization using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Since a large family of AI and machine learning problems reduces to solving large-scale convex optimization problems, the ADMM algorithm plays a key role in tackling these problems. For example, many supervised learning models under the Empirical Risk Minimization paradigm such as Lasso, Group Lasso, Generalized Linear Model, Logistic Regression, and SVM require minimizing a convex objective function. Running a linear regression on billions of training examples naturally translates to solving a convex problem with billions of terms in the objective function, and applying a distributed method to perform this optimization can considerably reduce the amount of time needed for this task. Moreover, once the scale of the problem becomes too large, solving the problem on a single machine is not even feasible because of memory limitations. In this project, we propose and examine a method to split an arbitrary convex optimization problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved efficiently in a distributed manner using the ADMM algorithm.",2015,
"Ensemble learning with trees and rules: Supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised","In this article, we propose several new approaches for post processing a large ensemble of conjunctive rules for supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning problems. We show with various examples that for high dimensional regression problems the models constructed by post processing the rules with partial least squares regression have significantly better prediction performance than the ones produced by the random forest or the rulefit algorithms which use equal weights or weights estimated from lasso regression. When rule ensembles are used for semi-supervised and unsupervised learning, the internal and external measures of cluster validity point to high quality groupings.",2014,Intell. Data Anal.
Uniform Consistency of the Highly Adaptive Lasso Estimator of Infinite Dimensional Parameters,"Consider the case that we observe $n$ independent and identically distributed copies of a random variable with a probability distribution known to be an element of a specified statistical model. We are interested in estimating an infinite dimensional target parameter that minimizes the expectation of a specified loss function. In \cite{generally_efficient_TMLE} we defined an estimator that minimizes the empirical risk over all multivariate real valued cadlag functions with variation norm bounded by some constant $M$ in the parameter space, and selects $M$ with cross-validation. We referred to this estimator as the Highly-Adaptive-Lasso estimator due to the fact that the constrained can be formulated as a bound $M$ on the sum of the coefficients a linear combination of a very large number of basis functions. Specifically, in the case that the target parameter is a conditional mean, then it can be implemented with the standard LASSO regression estimator. In \cite{generally_efficient_TMLE} we proved that the HAL-estimator is consistent w.r.t. the (quadratic) loss-based dissimilarity at a rate faster than $n^{-1/2}$ (i.e., faster than $n^{-1/4}$ w.r.t. a norm), even when the parameter space is completely nonparametric. The only assumption required for this rate is that the true parameter function has a finite variation norm. The loss-based dissimilarity is often equivalent with the square of an $L^2(P_0)$-type norm. In this article, we establish that under some weak continuity condition, the HAL-estimator is also uniformly consistent.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory
In situ DESI - MSI lipidomic profiles of breast cancer molecular subtypes and precursor lesions.,"Clinically meaningful molecular subtypes for classification of breast cancers have been established, however, initiation and progression of these subtypes remain poorly understood. The recent development of desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) facilitates the convergence of analytical chemistry and traditional pathology, allowing chemical profiling with minimal tissue pre-treatment in frozen samples. Here we characterized the chemical composition of molecular subtypes of breast cancer with DESI-MSI. Regions of interest (ROI) were identified, including invasive breast cancer (IBC), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and adjacent benign tissue (ABT), and metabolomic profiles at 200Î¼m elaborated using Biomap software and the Lasso method. Top ions identified in IBC regions included polyunsaturated fatty acids, deprotonated glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Highly saturated lipids, as well as antioxidant molecules [(taurine (m/z 124.0068), uric acid (m/z 167.0210), ascorbic acid (m/z 175.0241), and glutathione (m/z 306.0765)], were able to distinguish IBC form ABT. Moreover, luminal B and triple-negative subtypes showed more complex lipid profiles compared to Luminal A and HER-2 subtypes. DCIS and IBC were distinguished based on cell signaling and apoptosis-related ions [fatty acids (341.2100 and 382.3736 m/z) and glycerophospholipids (PE(P-16:0/22:6, m/z 746.5099, and PS(38:3), m/z 812.5440)]. In summary, DESI-MSI identified distinct lipid composition between DCIS and IBC and across molecular subtypes of breast cancer with potential implications for breast cancer pathogenesis.",2020,Cancer research
Recovering Structured Signals in High Dimensions via Non-Smooth Convex Optimization: Precise Performance Analysis,"The typical scenario that arises in modern large-scale inference problems is one where the ambient dimension of the unknown signal is very large (e.g., high-resolution images, recommendation systems), yet its desired properties lie in some low-dimensional structure such as, sparsity or low-rankness. In the past couple of decades, non-smooth convex optimization methods have emerged as a powerful tool to extract those structures, since they are often computationally efficient, and also they offer enough flexibility while simultaneously being amenable to performance analysis. Especially, since the advent of Compressed Sensing (CS) there has been significant progress towards this direction. One of the key ideas is that random linear measurements offer an efficient way to acquire structured signals. When the measurement matrix has entries iid from a wide class of distributions (including Gaussians), a series of recent works have established a complete and transparent theory that precisely captures the performance in the noiseless setting. In the more practical scenario of noisy measurements the performance analysis task becomes significantly more challenging and corresponding precise and unifying results have hitherto remained scarce. The available class of optimization methods, often referred to as regularized M-estimators, is now richer; additional factors (e.g., the noise distribution, the loss function, and the regularizer parameter) and several different measures of performance (e.g., squared-error, probability of support recovery) need to be taken into account. This thesis develops a novel analytical framework that overcomes these challenges, and establishes {precise asymptotic performance guarantees for regularized M-estimators under Gaussian measurement matrices. In particular, the framework allows for a unifying analysis among different instances (such as the Generalized LASSO, and the LAD, to name a few) and accounts for a wide class of performance measures. Among others, we show results on the mean-squared-error of the Generalized-LASSO method and make insightful connections to the classical theory of ordinary least squares and to noiseless CS. Empirical evidence is presented that suggests the Gaussian assumption is not necessary. Beyond iid measurement matrices, motivated by practical considerations, we study certain classes of random matrices with orthogonal rows and establish their superior performance when compared to Gaussians. A prominent application of this generic theory is on the analysis of the bit-error rate (BER) of the popular convex-relaxation of the Maximum Likelihood decoder for recovering BPSK signals in a massive Multiple Input Multiple Output setting. Our precise BER analysis allows comparison of these schemes to the unattainable Matched-filter bound, and further suggests means to provably boost their performance. The last challenge is to evaluate the performance under non-linear measurements. For the Generalized LASSO, it is shown that this is (asymptotically) equivalent to the one under noisy linear measurements with appropriately scaled variance. This encompasses state-of-the art theoretical results of one-bit CS , and is also used to prove that the optimal quantizer of the measurements that minimizes the estimation error of the Generalized LASSO is the celebrated Lloyd-Max quantizer. The framework is based on Gaussian process methods; in particular, on a new strong and tight version of a classical comparison inequality (due to Gordon, 1988) in the presence of additional convexity assumptions. We call this the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT).",2016,

Investigating the Utility of Fixed-margin Sampling in Network Psychometrics.,"Steinley, Hoffman, Brusco, and Sher (2017) proposed a new method for evaluating the performance of psychological network models: fixed-margin sampling. The authors investigated LASSO regularized Ising models (eLasso) by generating random datasets with the same margins as the original binary dataset, and concluded that many estimated eLasso parameters are not distinguishable from those that would be expected if the data were generated by chance. We argue that fixed-margin sampling cannot be used for this purpose, as it generates data under a particular null-hypothesis: a unidimensional factor model with interchangeable indicators (i.e., the Rasch model). We show this by discussing relevant psychometric literature and by performing simulation studies. Results indicate that while eLasso correctly estimated network models and estimated almost no edges due to chance, fixed-margin sampling performed poorly in classifying true effects as ""interesting"" (Steinley etÂ al. 2017, p. 1004). Further simulation studies indicate that fixed-margin sampling offers a powerful method for highlighting local misfit from the Rasch model, but performs only moderately in identifying global departures from the Rasch model. We conclude that fixed-margin sampling is not up to the task of assessing if results from estimated Ising models or other multivariate psychometric models are due to chance.",2018,Multivariate behavioral research
"Lectores, intelectuales y polÃ­ticos. El espacio social, cultural, polÃ­tico y los bienes simbÃ³licos en la Argentina. De un centenario a otro","The concept of intellectualism does not have an established meaning. As said by Carlos Altamirano, it is multivocal, controversial and has imprecise boundaries. Intellectuals play a transcendent role in society. As crucial participants of reality they transmit an image of the world and influence in the perceptions of it. Their status and authority in culture area, relate them with the field of power,which was deeply analyze by Pierre Bourdieu. From a series of interviews to Argentinean thinkers, which took place at the Social Science Faculty at USAL, a debate about the role of Argentinean intellectuals in the last decades had emerged. Throughout this academic space Argentinean intellectuals who specialize in various social areas and who belong to different generations and ideologies were interviewed: Norberto Galasso, Alcira Argumedo, Carlos Altarmirano, Pacho OÂ´Donnell, Mario Rapoport, among others.The main objective of this research aimed to think over â€œthe intellectualâ€ and its articulation with other categories, such as public official, citizen, politician and university student. Over this last mentioned category the debate was focused on considering the role of the university in consolidating the â€œintelligenza Argentinaâ€ and thee various lines of national ideas (thoughts). The research also aims to compare the profile of current intellectuals during the first centenary. Considering the comparison between Argentinean intellectuals in this century and the previous one, they have been men and women that had studied literature, social sciences, law, economy and that they have also been close to those with political powers, as suppliers of ideas, installers of discussions, and conducting reviews on the established knowledge. Beyond the historical context, intellectuals have approached the public and collective scene. What had proved to be different in time is the collective and public character of exposing the concept of political intellectual. What is new about current intellectuals is that they expose in public an intellectual political speech. They become collective intellectual that takes the word and publicity exposes its relation with the political and intellectual field.The narrative and analysis of the accounts that arose from the interviews to the modern Argentinean intellectuals, made us think about the possibility of articulating them into a matrix of thinkers, which far from taking us to unique and exclusive categories, will let us play with a descriptive mapping of the national intelligentsia in the last decades. We can not talk about a unique kind of intellectual but of different types: the diplomatic intellectual, the journalist intellectual, the province intellectual, the exiled intellectual, as any others.",2017,
Early Cretaceous Sporo-pollen Assemblage from Xie'ersu Formation in Qianjiadian Basin of Nei Monggol,"The present paper studies the sporo-pollen assemblage of the Xie'ersu Formation in the Qianjiadian Basin of Horqin Left Wing Rear Banner, Nei Monggol, which consists of a total collection of fossil sporo-pollen including 40 genera and 62 species, and fossil algae including 1 genus and 3 species.This assemblage is predominated by gymnospermous pollen grains(70â€”72ï¼…), among which are the pollen grains of coniferales with two sacci, such as Quadraeculina anellaeformis, Protopinus latebrosa, P. vastus, Parcisporites parvisaccus, Pseudopicea variabiliformis, Protopicea exilioides, P. mesophytica, Pityosporites divulgatus, Pinuspollenites insignis, Abietineaepollenites pectinella, Cedripites microsaccoides, Abiespollenites diversus, Podocarpidites multesimus and P. multicinus, totally attaining 60.5â€”64.7ï¼… on the average. Of lesser abundance are the nonsaccate coniferales pollen grains, such as Psophosphaera tenuis, P. microreticulata,Araucariacites australis and Classopollis annulatus, making up 5â€”7.7ï¼… on the average. Besides, there are some monosaccate coniferales, such as Cerebropollenites carlylensis, Jiaohepollis verus and J. priscus, making up 0.6â€”0.7ï¼… on the average, together with a few monocolpate pollen grains of Ginkgocycadophytus nitidus.In the assemblage, there is a low content of pteridophyte spores(averaging only 28â€”30ï¼…). Spores of Lygodiaceae are abundant and diverse, with a total of 13 species, namely: Lygodiumsporites subsimplex, Concavissimisporites verrucosus, C. asper, Pilosisporites trichopapillosus, P. verus, P. notensis, P. parvus, Cicatricosisporites dorogensis, C. mediostriatus, C. ludbrooki, Plicatella exiliformis, P. macrorhyza and P. cf. macrorhyza, making up 12.6â€”15.5ï¼… on the average. Cyathidites minor of Cyatheaceae ranks second in abundance, making up 2.8â€”5.4ï¼… on the average, together with some other elements such as Todisporites minor, Osmundacidites wellmanii, O. parvus, Retusotriletes scaber, Verrucosisporites cf. granatus, Leptolepidites psarosus, Baculatisporites comaumensis(2.2ï¼…), Lycopodiumsporites clavatoides, Brochotriletes cf. botrychiumformis, Triporoletes reticulatus, Densoisporites velatus, D. microrugulates(1.8â€”6.1ï¼…), Aeguitriradites verrucosus, A. spinulosus and Schizaeoisporites sp., etc. The rest of the other elements making up1.5ï¼….Three species of fossil algae, namely Schizospo(?)is reticulatus, S. parvus and S. spriggi had been proviously reported from this formation.According to the characters of the above-stated palynological assemblage, the age of this assemblage is referable to the Early Cretaceous(Hauterivian-Barremian). The characteristics of this flora suggest that during the Early Cretaceous the climate of the Qianjiadian Basin was of the subtropical type under warm and moist conditions.This research is sponsored by the National Seience Foundation of China.",1988,

Calcium chloride brines are found in the Paleozoic and Late Proterozoic sedimentary, metamorphic and volcano-sedimentary complexes at a depth of 3-5 km. Their origin is associated with sedimentation processes occurred in talassogenic basins with different salinity gradients and with subsequent metamorphism of the surrounding rocks due to the epigenetic processes.",2016,
"The marine Tubificidae (Oligochaeta) of the barrier reef ecosystems at Carrie Bow Cay, Belize, and other parts of the Caribbean Sea, with descriptions of twenty-seven new species and revision of Heterodrilus, Thalassodrilides and Smithsonidrilus","Fifty-nine species of Tubifieidae are recorded from Belize on the Caribbean side of Central America. Twenty-five are new to science: Ainudrilus geminus sp.n., Heronidrilus gravidus sp.n., Heterodrilus flexuosus sp.n., H. ranus sp.n., H. modestus sp.n., Coralliodrilus rugosus sp.n., C. randyi sp.n., Phallodrilus compactus sp. n., P. singularis sp.n., P. vicinus sp.n., P. nasutus sp.n., P. bipartitus sp.n., Inanidrilus reginae sp.n., Olavius finitimus sp.n., O. vacuus sp.n., O. (Olavius) pravus sp.n., Bathydrilus vetustus sp.n., B. egenus sp.n., Thalassodrilides bruneti sp.n., Limnodriloides anxius sp.n., L. major sp.n., L. sacculus sp.n., L. adversus sp.n., Smithsonidrilus appositus sp.n., S. involutus sp.n. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Heterodrilus Pierantoni, 1902, Thalassodrilides Brinkhurst & Baker, 1979, and Marcusaedrilus Righi & Kanner, 1979, are paraphyletic taxa as previously defined. They are therefore revised to include also apomorphic species earlier attributed to separate genera; in so doing, Marcusaedrilus becomes a junior synonym of Smithsonidrilus Brinkhurst, 1966. Smithsonidrilus pauper sp.n. (Peru), and S. multiglandularis sp.n. (Florida and Puerto Rico) are also described, and Limnodriloides claviger Erseus, 1982 is regarded as a synonym of L. pierantonii (HrabÄ›, 1971).",1990,Zoologica Scripta
Interspecific aggression in two highly similar Stegastes damselfish,"Interspecific aggression may be caused by competition for resources or result from species misidentification. Species may exhibit aggressive responses that are similar, or symmetrical, to each other, or one species may respond more aggressively than the other, exhibiting asymmetrical aggression. We examined aggressive symmetry in two territorial Caribbean damselfish species, the longfin damselfish (Stegastes diencaeous) and the dusky damselfish (S. adustus) because they exhibit qualities that make such relationships hard to predict. These two species show considerable habitat overlap, are closely related and are nearly identical in gross morphology, suggesting they would show the same intensity of aggressiveness to heterospecifics and conspecifics. However, longfins reach a larger adult size, which may cause these two species to instead aggress asymmetrically toward one another. We also tested residents' responses toward bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), a common egg predator, to see if highly similar species respond similarly to a presumably equal threat not likely to be misidentified as a conspecific. We presented residents with either a single intruder or two simultaneous intruders to determine if context affected aggressive behavior. When presented with a single intruder, both resident species attacked conspecifics and congenerics with somewhat similar aggression, suggesting either a broad competitive overlap or misidentification. When residents were forced to divide their time between two simultaneous damselfish intruders, they clearly aggressed more intensely toward conspecifics. Additionally, longfins were more aggressive to bluehead wrasse than were dusky damselfish in single and paired presentations. We propose that the higher aggression toward wrasse by longfins is related to longfins having territories on which their eggs are naturally more exposed compared to a typical dusky territory in which eggs are more hidden.",2013,Ethology Ecology & Evolution
Improved IAMB with Expanded Markov Blanket for High-Dimensional Time Series Prediction âˆ—,"The classic regression model for multivari- ate time series prediction suffers from the curse of dimen- sionality because the least squares estimates become unre- liable when the predictors of the time series are large and the number of samples is limited. The classic methods such as ridge regression, lasso regression, principal component regression are researched to solve the problem above. The ridge regression and principal component regression can not give the clear interpretation features for prediction, and lasso regression does not work well under collinear- ity, also the selections given by lasso regression are unsta- ble and very sensitive to minor perturbations of the data. A practical method based on improved Incremental asso- ciation Markov blanket (IAMB) with Expanded Markov blanket (EMB) was proposed for high-dimensional time series prediction. The EMB was constructed with simulta- neous predictors and past predictors for time series. Since the faithfulness condition and reliable conditional indepen- dence test are not satisfied for high-dimensional time series with limited samples in practical applications. The sym- metry of Markov blanket (MB) and the partial correla- tion coefficient criterion for conditional independent test were employed to learn the EMB, on which the regression was used for prediction. Empirical results show that our method based on EMB for macroeconomic prediction has less mean-square forecast error than other classic methods, especially when predicting the value with sharp fluctua- tion.",2016,Chinese Journal of Electronics
Respiratory mycobiome and suggestion of inter-kingdom network during acute pulmonary exacerbation in cystic fibrosis,"Lung infections play a critical role in cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogenesis. CF respiratory tract is now considered to be a polymicrobial niche and advances in high-throughput sequencing allowed to analyze its microbiota and mycobiota. However, no NGS studies until now have characterized both communities during CF pulmonary exacerbation (CFPE). Thirty-three sputa isolated from patients with and without CFPE were used for metagenomic high-throughput sequencing targeting 16S and ITS2 regions of bacterial and fungal rRNA. We built inter-kingdom network and adapted Phy-Lasso method to highlight correlations in compositional data. The decline in respiratory function was associated with a decrease in bacterial diversity. The inter-kingdom network revealed three main clusters organized around Aspergillus, Candida, and Scedosporium genera. Using Phy-Lasso method, we identified Aspergillus and Malassezia as relevantly associated with CFPE, and Scedosporium plus Pseudomonas with a decline in lung function. We corroborated in vitro the cross-domain interactions between Aspergillus and Streptococcus predicted by the correlation network. For the first time, we included documented mycobiome data into a version of the ecological Climax/Attack model that opens new lines of thoughts about the physiopathology of CF lung disease and future perspectives to improve its therapeutic management.",2020,Scientific Reports
Host genetics and immune control of HIV-1 infection: Fine mapping for the extended human MHC region in an African cohort,"Multiple major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci encoding human leukocyte antigens (HLA) have allelic variants unequivocally associated with differential immune control of HIV-1 infection. Fine mapping based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the extended MHC (xMHC) region is expected to reveal causal or novel factors and to justify a search for functional mechanisms. We have tested the utility of a custom fine-mapping platform (the ImmunoChip) for 172 HIV-1 seroconverters (SCs) and 449 seroprevalent individuals (SPs) from Lusaka, Zambia, with a focus on more than 6400 informative xMHC SNPs. When conditioned on HLA and nongenetic factors previously associated with HIV-1 viral load (VL) in the study cohort, penalized approaches (HyperLasso models) identified an intergenic SNP (rs3094626 between RPP21 and HLA-E) and an intronic SNP (rs3134931 in NOTCH4) as novel correlates of early set-point VL in SCs. The minor allele of rs2857114 (downstream from HLA-DOB) was an unfavorable factor in SPs. Joint models based on demographic features, HLA alleles and the newly identified SNP variants could explain 29% and 15% of VL variance in SCs and SPs, respectively. These findings and bioinformatics strongly suggest that both classic and nonclassic MHC genes deserve further investigation, especially in Africans with relatively short haplotype blocks.",2014,Genes and immunity
A 1.06 Î¼W smart ECG processor in 65 nm CMOS for real-time biometrie authentication and personal cardiac monitoring,"A smart wearable electrocardiographic (ECG) processor is presented for secure ECG-based biometric authentication and cardiac monitoring, including arrhythmia and anomaly detection. Data-driven Lasso regression and low-precision techniques are developed to compress the neural networks by 24.4X. The prototype chip fabricated in 65 nm LP CMOS consumes 1.06 Î¼W at 0.55 V for real-time ECG authentication. Equal error rates of 0.74% and 1.7% are achieved on ECG-ID database and in-house 645-subject database, respectively.",2017,2017 Symposium on VLSI Circuits
Vegetative morphology and meristem dependence â€” The foundation of productivity in seagrasses,"Abstract Shoot organization in seagrasses varies from the unspecialized condition of Enhalus and Posidonia to the highly differentiated shoot systems of plants like Halophila, Thalassodendron and Thalassia . In the former type proliferation of vegetative meristems seems to be an unordered process, whereas in the latter type proliferation can be very ordered. In some examples, e.g. Syringodium , proliferation of rhizomes is not regularized in shoot organization but is largely a consequence of perturbation by the environment. Since production of new organs and proliferation of indeterminate shoot systems is dependent entirely on continually active meristems, with either a limited tendency to form resting meristems or often no such ability at all, seagrasses show a high degree of meristem dependency.",1974,Aquaculture
Learning Heteroscedastic Models by Convex Programming under Group Sparsity,"Popular sparse estimation methods based on l1-relaxation, such as the Lasso and the Dantzig selector, require the knowledge of the variance of the noise in order to properly tune the regularization parameter. This constitutes a major obstacle in applying these methods in several frameworks--such as time series, random fields, inverse problems--for which the noise is rarely homoscedastic and its level is hard to know in advance. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the joint estimation of the conditional mean and the conditional variance in a high-dimensional (auto-) regression setting. An attractive feature of the proposed estimator is that it is efficiently computable even for very large scale problems by solving a second-order cone program (SOCP). We present theoretical analysis and numerical results assessing the performance of the proposed procedure.",2013,
