Variable Selection in the Regularized Simultaneous Component Analysis Method for Multi-Source Data Integration,"Interdisciplinary research often involves analyzing data obtained from different data sources with respect to the same subjects, objects, or experimental units. For example, global positioning systems (GPS) data have been coupled with travel diary data, resulting in a better understanding of traveling behavior. The GPS data and the travel diary data are very different in nature, and, to analyze the two types of data jointly, one often uses data integration techniques, such as the regularized simultaneous component analysis (regularized SCA) method. Regularized SCA is an extension of the (sparse) principle component analysis model to the cases where at least two data blocks are jointly analyzed, which - in order to reveal the joint and unique sources of variation - heavily relies on proper selection of the set of variables (i.e., component loadings) in the components. Regularized SCA requires a proper variable selection method to either identify the optimal values for tuning parameters or stably select variables. By means of two simulation studies with various noise and sparseness levels in simulated data, we compare six variable selection methods, which are cross-validation (CV) with the â€œone-standard-errorâ€ rule, repeated double CV (rdCV), BIC, Bolasso with CV, stability selection, and index of sparseness (IS) - a lesser known (compared to the first five methods) but computationally efficient method. Results show that IS is the best-performing variable selection method.",2019,Scientific Reports
Assessment of Three Grape Varieties' Resistance to Five Viruses and Assembly of a Novel Grapevine Vein Clearing Virus Genome,"Over 65 viruses are known to infect grapevines, more than any other agricultural crop. Growth, yield, and quality of virus-infected vines suffer, reducing the profitability to grape growers. Therefore, it is critical to identify grape cultivars resistant to these viruses which can be utilized to protect more susceptible varieties from infection. Wine grape cultivar Norton (Vitis aestivalis) and Chambourcin (V. vinifera hybrid), and rootstock St. George (V. rupestris) have been known to be disease tolerant. In the first study, Norton and Chambourcin were infected with Grapevine fleck virus (GFkV), Grapevine leafrollassociated virus 3 (GLRaV-3), Grapevine virus A (GVA), and Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV). Norton and V. rupestris â€˜St. Georgeâ€™ were infected with Grapevine vein clearing virus (GVCV). Testing of virus-infected grapevines for each virus by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays indicated that the three grape varieties are susceptible to the viruses tested, and, therefore, none should be utilized as virus-resistant cultivars. In the second study, a wild V. rupestris â€˜Scheeleâ€™ vine was tested positive for GVCV, which is referred to as GVCV-VRU, marking the first instance this virus has been observed in the native wild V. rupestris population. The whole genome (7,755bp) of the new GVCV-VRU isolate was assembled. Sequence analysis revealed that GVCVVRU and GVCV-CHA shared 92% nucleotide identity. The discovery of a new GVCV isolate in wild V. rupestris grapevine and its association with vein clearing disease may have important implications for origin and management of GVCV.",2015,
Pulse pressure and stroke risk: development and validation of a new stroke risk model.,"OBJECTIVE
This study aims to develop and validate a stroke risk model incorporating pulse pressure (PP) as a potential risk factor. Recent evidence suggests that PP, defined as the difference between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), could be an incremental risk factor beyond SBP.


METHODS
Electronic health records (EHRs) of hypertensive patients from a US integrated health delivery system were analyzed (January 2004 to May 2012). Patients with â‰¥ 1 PP reading and â‰¥ 6 months of observation prior to the first diagnosis of hypertension were randomly split into development (two-thirds of sample) and validation (one-third of sample) datasets. Stroke events were identified using ICD-9-CM 433.xx-436.xx. Cox proportional hazards models assessed time to first stroke event within 3 years of first hypertension diagnosis based on baseline risk factors, including PP, age, gender, diabetes, and cardiac comorbidities. The optimal model was selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO); performance was evaluated by the c-statistic.


RESULTS
Among 34,797 patients selected (mean age 59.3 years, 48% male), 4272 patients (12.3%) had a stroke. PP was higher among patients who developed stroke (mean [SD] PP, stroke: 02.0 [15.3] mmHg; non-stroke: 58.1 [14.0] mmHg, p < 0.001). The best performing risk model (c-statistic, development: 0.730; validation: 0.729) included PP (hazard ratio per mmHg increase: 1.0037, p < 0.001) as a significant risk factor.


LIMITATIONS
This study was subject to limitations similar to other studies using EHRs. Only patient encounters occurring within the single healthcare network were captured in the data source. Though the model was tested internally, external validation (using a separate data source) would help assess the model's generalizability and calibration.


CONCLUSIONS
This stroke risk model shows that greater PP is a significant predictive factor for increased stroke risk, even in the presence of known risk factors. PP should be considered by practitioners along with established risk factors in stroke treatment strategies.",2014,Current medical research and opinion
The Doubly Adaptive LASSO for Vector Autoregressive Models,"The LASSO (Tibshirani, J R Stat Soc Ser B 58(1):267â€“288, 1996, [30]) and the adaptive LASSO (Zou, J Am Stat Assoc 101:1418â€“1429, 2006, [37]) are popular in regression analysis for their advantage of simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation, and also have been applied to autoregressive time series models. We propose the doubly adaptive LASSO (daLASSO), or PLAC-weighted adaptive LASSO, for modelling stationary vector autoregressive processes. The procedure is doubly adaptive in the sense that its adaptive weights are formulated as functions of the norms of the partial lag autocorrelation matrix function (Heyse, 1985, [17]) and Yuleâ€“Walker or ordinary least squares estimates of a vector time series. The existing papers ignore the partial lag autocorrelation information inherent in a VAR process. The procedure shows promising results for VAR models. The procedure excels in terms of VAR lag order identification.",2016,
The use of nonnegative garrote for order selection of ARX models,"Order selection of linear regression models has been thoroughly researched in the statistical community for some time. Different shrinkage methods have been proposed, such as the Ridge and Lasso regression methods. Especially the Lasso regression has won fame because of its ability to set less important parameters exactly to zero. However, these methods do not take dynamical systems into account, where the regressors are ordered via the time lag. To this end, a modified variant of the nonnegative garrote method will be analyzed.",2008,2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control
Convex Relaxation for Combinatorial Penalties,"In this paper, we propose an unifying view of several recently proposed structured sparsity-inducing norms. We consider the situation of a model simultaneously (a) penalized by a set- function de ned on the support of the unknown parameter vector which represents prior knowledge on supports, and (b) regularized in Lp-norm. We show that the natural combinatorial optimization problems obtained may be relaxed into convex optimization problems and introduce a notion, the lower combinatorial envelope of a set-function, that characterizes the tightness of our relaxations. We moreover establish links with norms based on latent representations including the latent group Lasso and block-coding, and with norms obtained from submodular functions.",2012,ArXiv
Emanuele Trevi e la teoria iniziatica della letteratura,"Nello scrittore Emanuele Trevi e possibile rinvenire una teoria iniziatica della letteratura. Essa concepisce il testo letterario sia come vettore di trasformazione per il fruitore sia come depositario dellâ€™originaria cultura iniziatica, accesso alle verita nascoste dellâ€™esistenza. Il testo appare come uno degli ultimi, se non lâ€™ultimo, contenitore di questa sapienza primordiale: centrale nelle societa e nelle religioni antiche, oggi tale grande codice appare sostanzialmente perduto. Interlocutori di Trevi sono storici delle religioni (Schure, Corbin, Eliade), narratori (Apuleio, Melville, Collodi, V. Woolf, Joyce), protagonisti in prima persona di viaggi iniziatici (Artaud), filosofi e critici (Agamben, Zolla, Citati, Calasso, C. Campo). La teoria elaborata da Trevi sembra voler uscire da un esclusivo perimetro letterario e recuperare una dimensione antropologica dellâ€™espressivita simbolica che contenga anche, in uno stretto circolo ermeneutico, musica e pittura. La letteratura si avvicina in ultima analisi a unâ€˜esperienza di apprendistato e a un rito sacro. In Emanuele Treviâ€™s work it is possible to trace an initiatory theory of literature, conceiving the literary text both as vector of transformation for the reader and as a repository of initiatic culture, providing access to the hidden truths of existence. The text appears as one of the last, if not the last, container of this primordial wisdom: central in the ancient society and religion, today such great code substantially seems to be lost. Treviâ€™s fellows are historians of religion (Schure, Corbin, Eliade), narrators (Apuelio, Melville, Collodi, Woolf, Joyce), protagonists of trips (Artaud), philosophers and critics (Agamben, Zolla, Citati, Calasso, C. Campo). Treviâ€™s theory apparently moves beyond the perimeter of literature, recovering an anthropological di- mension of symbolic expression that also features, in a narrow hermeneutical circle, music and painting. Thus literature draws near to an experience of apprenticeship and a sacred rite.",2014,

Observer design for systems with an energy-preserving non-linearity,"AbstractObserver design is considered for a class of non-linear systems whose non-linearpart is energy preserving. A strategy to construct convergent observers for this classof non-linear system is presented. The approach has the advantage that it is possible,via convex programming, to prove whether the constructed observer converges, incontrast to several existing approaches to observer design for non-linear systems.Finally, the developed methods are applied to the Lorenz attractor and to a loworder model for shear uid ow. 1Introduction Observer design for non-linear systems is an important and dicult problem. In thispaper, observer design is considered for systems whose non-linear part has an energypreserving structure. In particular,x_(t) = Ax(t) + N(x(t))x(t); t0;y(t) = Cx(t); t0;x(0) = x 0 2R n :(1)where A2R n n , C2R p n and N: R n !R n n is a linear operator. Furthermore, it isassumed that the non-linearity N(x)xhas the energy preserving propertyx > N(x)x= 0; x2R n : (2)Observer design for non-linear systems has received much attention, with approachesfalling into two main categories. One approach, rst considered in [16] and generalizedin [11, 12, 14, 15], is to apply a change of co-ordinates to linearize the system, upto an additional term involving the output y(t). Subsequently, linear design methodscan be applied to create an observer for the transformed system, then the co-ordinatetransformation is inverted to form an observer for the original, non-linear, system.

Elastoâ€plastic Hardening and Shakedown of Masonry Arch Joints,"The behavior of joints made of sandâ€“lime mortar, such as used in a wide variety of structures from ancient times through the early twentieth century, can be clearly distinguished from the behavior of joints made with hydraulic cement mortar. Experiments on confined mortar specimens have confirmed that the weaker and more ductile sandâ€“lime mortar can be accurately modeled as a Druckerâ€“Prager material with a compression cap and exponential hardening on the cap portion of the yield surface. Joints of sandâ€“lime mortar subject to axial thrust and moment are found experimentally to yield under very small loads, and to follow a linear hardening rule beyond the yield point. This behavior can be replicated analytically using a Druckerâ€“Prager constitutive law with exponential hardening. The yield surface and hardening function for an entire mortar joint are representable by Maier's theory of piecewise linear yield function and interacting yield planes. As a consequence, an arch jointed with sandâ€“lime mortar is found to shake down under moving loads above the yield limit and below the collapse load. The shakedown behavior of a sandâ€“lime mortar jointed masonry arch is confirmed experimentally.Sommario. II comportamento dei giunti realizzati con malta di calce, del tipo di quelli utilizzati in unâ€™ampia varietÃ  di strutture dallâ€™ antichitÃ  sino allâ€™inizio di questo secolo, puÃ² essere chiaramente distinto dal comportamento dei giunti realizzati con malta idraulica. Esperimenti condotti su provini confinati di malta hanno infatti evidenziato che il comportamento della malta di calce, meno resistente e piÃ¹ duttile, puÃ² essere accuratamente modellato con un materiale di Druckerâ€“Prager, adottando un troncamento della resistenza a compressione ed un incrudimento esponenziale della superficie di snervamento nella porzione troncata. Si Ã¨ rilevato sperimentalmente che i giunti di malta di calce, soggetti a sforzo assiale e momento flettente, raggiungono lo snervamento sotto carichi molto modesti, e quindi seguono una legge di incrudimento lineare oltre il punto di snervamento. Questo comportamento puÃ² essere riprodotto analiticamente utilizzando la legge costitutiva di Druckerâ€“Prager con incrudimento esponenziale. La superficie di snervamento e la funzione di incrudimento per un giunto di malta sono rappresentabili mediante la teoria di Maier delle funzioni di snervamento lineari a tratti e dei piani di snervamento interagenti. Di conseguenza, un arco con giunti di malta di calce perviene allâ€™adattamento plastico (shakedown) sotto carichi mobili superiori al limite di snervamento ed inferiori al carico di collasso. Tale raggiungimento della condizione di adattamento plastico di archi di muratura con giunti di malta di calce Ã¨ confermato sperimentalmente.",1999,Meccanica
Nesterov Acceleration Schemes for Group Lasso,"Convex optimization is a fundamental theoretical core for many well known machine learning models used in day-to-day problems. Studying and getting a better understanding of these methods is an important aspect to build good models and extract proper conclusions. Furthermore, we will also focus on the study of linear models such as Lasso and Group Lasso, which incorporates several advantages, being the most important ones the cheap computational cost and the interpretability of the resulting models. In this Masterâ€™s Thesis we will first review the field of convex optimization from a pure theoretical point of view, studying concepts such as subdifferential and proximal descent minimization in order to minimize composite functions where one of its components is non differentiable. This theoretical background is the base to study ISTA, a first iterative approach to minimize such functions. To improve the convergence of ISTA, Nesterov first introduced an optimization to reach an optimal convergence ratio of O(1/k2), which is a significant improvement over the O(1/k) convergence of ISTA. This optimized method is known as FISTA. Nonetheless, even if this optimization allows us to reach a faster theoretical convergence, in practice we see that it may not be monotone, which usually affects the convergence, making it slower in real applications. To solve these issues there have been several proposals. We have studied here some restarting schemes proposed by Oâ€™Donoghe and Candes and further optimizations introduced by Ito and colleagues that actually make FISTA faster in practice. To show the effects of these optimizations we have ended this work by presenting some real experiments. A first experiment consists on synthetic data generated from a Gaussian distribution. This experiment focuses on exploring the effects of the different proposed optimizations and its advantage over standard FISTA. In this experiment we clearly see how the optimized methods are clearly better in terms of iterations to convergence than FISTA. Nonetheless, a synthetic experiment is not a conclusive demonstration. For this, we have also applied these methods to a real problem of wind energy prediction in Sotavento, a wind farm located in Galicia, northwest Spain. In this experiment we pursue two goals. First, to test the usefulness of the optimized methods in a complex cross-validation setup where we test many hyperparameters and the effects of such strategies. Second, to test Group Lasso as a competitive model against state of art models such as Lasso and Ridge. In summary, we have observed that the optimizations are not only useful in a singlerun setup, where the worst case shows a performance similar to standard FISTA, but in a cross-validation setup, where the benefit is actually greater. This has to do with the shape of the problem and the penalization term. A small penalization implies a very wide area to find the solution, and then a greater optimization may be expected. On the other hand, a big penalization makes the problem pretty much â€œstraightforwardâ€, making all models behave similarly. In terms of competitiveness, we see that Group Lasso performs similarly to other methods such as Lasso, and better than Ridge, with the added advantage of a grouped structure and thus an interesting interpretation of the final model in terms of feature selection.",2017,
Learning Random Kernel Approximations for Object Recognition,"Approximations based on random Fourier features have recently emerged as an efficient and formally consistent methodology to design large-scale kernel machines. By expressing the kernel as a Fourier expansion, features are generated based on a finite set of random basis projections, sampled from the Fourier transform of the kernel, with inner products that are Monte Carlo approximations of the original kernel. Based on the observation that different kernel-induced Fourier sampling distributions correspond to different kernel parameters, we show that an optimization process in the Fourier domain can be used to identify the different frequency bands that are useful for prediction on training data. Moreover, the application of group Lasso to random feature vectors corresponding to a linear combination of multiple kernels, leads to efficient and scalable reformulations of the standard multiple kernel learning model \cite{Varma09}. In this paper we develop the linear Fourier approximation methodology for both single and multiple gradient-based kernel learning and show that it produces fast and accurate predictors on a complex dataset such as the Visual Object Challenge 2011 (VOC2011).",2012,ArXiv
The Correlation Structure of Credit Default Swaps,"We analyze correlation matrix estimation from the perspective of market risk management, where the goal is to obtain accurate estimates of portfolio risk across essentially all portfolios â€” even those with small standard deviations. We use the portfolio perspective to determine estimators, loss functions and regularizers particularly suitable for market risk management. We propose several specialized loss functions, and a simple but effective visualization tool to assess estimators. Proper regularization of the correlation matrix significantly improves dynamic covariance models. These methods are applied to credit default swaps (CDS), for which correlation matrices are used to set portfolio margin requirements for central clearing. Among the methods we test, the graphical lasso estimator performs particularly well. The graphical lasso and a hierarchical clustering estimator also yield economically meaningful representations of market structure through a graphical model and a hierarchy, respectively. We find that credit default swap log-differences are driven by a strong market factor. The additional effect of natural candidates for other observable market factors is small, but there are latent factors and direct pairwise dependencies at play. We also examine the relationship between credit default swap correlations and implied correlations extracted from equity prices through distance-to-default measures. The difference between actual and implied log-differences is driven by a common factor that may reflect a premium for risk and possibly liquidity.",2016,
Statistical Arbitrage with Uncertain Fat Tails,"I develop a model of statistical arbitrage trading in an environment with â€œfat-tailedâ€ information. If risk-neutral arbitrageurs are uncertain about the variance of fat-tail shocks and if they implement max-min robust optimization, they will choose to ignore a wide range of pricing errors. Although model risk hinders they willingness to trade, arbitrageurs can capture the most profitable opportunities because they follow a linear momentum strategy beyond the inaction zone. This is equivalent to a machine-learning algorithm called LASSO. Arbitrageurs can also amass market power due to conservative trading under this strategy. Their uncoordinated exercise of robust control facilitates tacit collusion, protecting their profits from being competed away even if their number goes to infinity. In an extended model where an insider strategically interacts with those arbitrageurs, the insider can induce them to trade too aggressively, giving herself a reversal trading opportunity. Doing so distorts price informativeness and threatens market stability.",2018,
Generalized and smooth James-Stein model selection,"The generalized and smooth James-Stein thresholding functions link and extend the thresholding functions employed by the James-Stein estimator, the block- and adaptive-lasso in variable selection, and the soft-, hard- and block-thresholding in wavelet smoothing. The estimator is indexed by two hyperparameters for more flexibility and a smoothness parameter for better estimation of its l2-risk with the Stein unbiased risk estimate (SURE). For blocks of a fixed size, a situation that arises when observing concomitant signals (e.g., gravitational wave bursts), we derive a universal threshold, an information criterion and an oracle inequality for block thresholding. Smooth James-Stein thresholding can also be employed in parametric regression for variable selection. In that case a unique smooth estimate is defined, its smooth SURE is derived, which provides the equivalent degrees of freedom of adaptive lasso as a side result. The new estimator enjoys smoothness like ridge regression and performs variable selection like lasso.",2010,
Shrinkage estimation of varying covariate effects based on quantile regression,"Varying covariate effects often manifest meaningful heterogeneity in covariate-response associations. In this paper, we adopt a quantile regression model that assumes linearity at a continuous range of quantile levels as a tool to explore such data dynamics. The consideration of potential non-constancy of covariate effects necessitates a new perspective for variable selection, which, under the assumed quantile regression model, is to retain variables that have effects on all quantiles of interest as well as those that influence only part of quantiles considered. Current work on l1-penalized quantile regression either does not concern varying covariate effects or may not produce consistent variable selection in the presence of covariates with partial effects, a practical scenario of interest. In this work, we propose a shrinkage approach by adopting a novel uniform adaptive LASSO penalty. The new approach enjoys easy implementation without requiring smoothing. Moreover, it can consistently identify the true model (uniformly across quantiles) and achieve the oracle estimation efficiency. We further extend the proposed shrinkage method to the case where responses are subject to random right censoring. Numerical studies confirm the theoretical results and support the utility of our proposals.",2014,Statistics and Computing
The left atrial appendage-a design fl aw or an essential structure ?,"The LAA has been burnt, slashed, lassoed and even had its throat stuffed, all without a thought for its wellbeing or consideration for the possibility that it may have an important function to play and that these interventions could impact on its function. So, should the LAA not take kindly to the way it is being treated and should it decide to fight back, it may very well lay charges of assault and attempted murder. The council for the defence would no doubt put forward 3 strong arguments justifying the alleged assault on the LAA.",2018,
A Multi-Element Expression Score Is A Prognostic Factor In Glioblastoma Multiforme,"Purpose
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Although primary GBM patients receive extensive therapies, tumors may recur within months, and there is no objective and scientific method to predict prognosis. Adoptive immunotherapy holds great promise for GBM treatment. However, the expression profiles of the tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and tumor immune microenvironment (TME) genes used in immunotherapy of GBM patients have not been fully described. The present study aimed to develop a predictive tool to evaluate patient survival based on full analysis of the expression levels of TAAs and TME genes.


Methods
Expression profiles of a panel of 87 TAAs and 8 TME genes significantly correlated with poor prognosis were evaluated in 44 GBM patients and 10 normal brain tissues using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A linear formula (the LASSO algorithm based in the R package) weighted by regression coefficients was used to develop a multi-element expression score to predict prognosis; this formula was cross-validated by the leave-one-out method in different GBM cohorts.


Results
After analysis of gene expression, clinical features, and overall survival (OS), a total of 8 TAAs (CHI3L1, EZH2, TRIOBP, PCNA, PIK3R1, PRKDC, SART3 and EPCAM), 1 TME gene (FOXP3) and 4 clinical features (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR), number of basophils (BAS), age and treatment with standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy) were included in the formula. There were significant differences between high and low scoring groups identified using the formula in different GBM cohorts (TCGA (n=732) and GEO databases (n=84)), implying poor and good prognosis, respectively.


Conclusion
The multi-element expression score was significantly associated with OS of GBM patients. The improve understanding of TAAs and TMEs and well-defined formula could be implemented in immunotherapy for GBM to provide better care.",2019,Cancer Management and Research
Sparse semi-supervised learning on low-rank kernel,"Advances of modern science and engineering lead to unprecedented amount of data for information processing. Of particular interest is the semi-supervised learning, where very few training samples are available among large volumes of unlabeled data. Graph-based algorithms using Laplacian regularization have achieved state-of-the-art performance, but can induce huge memory and computational costs. In this paper, we introduce L""1-norm penalization on the low-rank factorized kernel for efficient, globally optimal model selection in graph-based semi-supervised learning. An important novelty is that our formulation can be transformed to a standard LASSO regression. On one hand, this makes it possible to employ advanced sparse solvers to handle large scale problems; on the other hand, a globally optimal subset of basis can be chosen adaptively given desired strength of penalizing model complexity, in contrast to some current endeavors that pre-determine the basis without coupling it with the learning task. Our algorithm performs competitively with state-of-the-art algorithms on a variety of benchmark data sets. In particular, it is orders of magnitude faster than exact algorithms and achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and scalability.",2014,Neurocomputing
"Isolation,Identification and Fermentation Condition Optimization of a Protease-producing Moderately Halophilic Strain, Thalassobacillus sp. SY-7","A protease-producing strain SY-7 was screened by skim milk agar method from Tianjin offshore salt pan of China.The strain was identified by morphological,biochemical and physiological and phylogentic analysis,and the fermentation conditions for protease-producing were optimized by Plackett-Burman(PB) design and response surface methodology.Strain SY-7 was Gram-positive,and it grew best at 30 â„ƒ,pH 7.5 and with the presence of 10% NaCl.Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the strain belonged to the genus Thalassobacillus,and had the highest similarity(98.88%) with T.devorans.Three statistically significant parameters(quantity of glucose,liquid volume and inoculum volume) were determined by PB design.With the hybrid design,response surfaces were optimized and response surface function was obtained.The production of protease increased significantly to 1 390 U/mL from 870 U/mL under the optimal levels of the fermentation conditions.The test data of enzyme activity reached 98.3% of the calculated data,indicating that the optimization was effective.",2011,Chinese Journal of Appplied Environmental Biology
Bioluminescence in decapod Crustacea,"Luminescence in decapod crustaceans may be of two kinds. Either a secretion is ejected into the surrounding water as a luminous cloud, or specific light organs, which may be internal or superficial, glow steadily (Balss, 1944). There may be more than 150 photophores in some species of decapod, and the number, position and development of these organs in Systellaspis debilis and species of Sergia have been described by Coutiere (1906), Kemp (1910a), Terao (1917) and Gordon (1935). The production of luminous clouds has been observed in the Oplophoridae, Pandalidae and Thalassocarididae of the Caridea, and in the Penaeidae of the Penaeidea (Table 1). Observations of the luminescence of specific light organs or tissues are much less numerous. Luminescence has been observed among the Oplophoridae from the photophores of species of Systellaspis and Oplophorus and from the liver of Hymenodora . The hepatic organs of Parapandalus of the Pandalidae have been seen to luminesce, and among the Penaeidea both the hepatic organs of Pesta of Sergestes and the superficial organs of Sergia have been seen to emit light (for references see Table 1). Undoubted hepatic light organs also occur in Chlorotocoides and Thalassocaris of the Thalassocarididae, and superficial organs in Hymenopenaeus debilis of the Penaeidae. Additional organs of doubtful function which have been described as possible photophores occur on the chelae of the homolid crab Hypsophrys , in the branchial chamber of Sergestes , the pleopods of Parapandalus and the uropods of Acetes (Table 2). There are unconfirmed reports of luminescence in the eye of Pasiphaea etarda (Kiernik, 1908) and in Polycheles (Alcock, 1902) and Leptochela (Chace, 1940), neither of the latter two cases being ascribed to a particular organ, though â€˜a greasy glandular patchâ€™ near the oviduct was implicated in Polycheles .",1976,Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom
A Machine Learning Approach Using Survival Statistics to Predict Graft Survival in Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Multicenter Cohort Study,"Accurate prediction of graft survival after kidney transplant is limited by the complexity and heterogeneity of risk factors influencing allograft survival. In this study, we applied machine learning methods, in combination with survival statistics, to build new prediction models of graft survival that included immunological factors, as well as known recipient and donor variables. Graft survival was estimated from a retrospective analysis of the data from a multicenter cohort of 3,117 kidney transplant recipients. We evaluated the predictive power of ensemble learning algorithms (survival decision tree, bagging, random forest, and ridge and lasso) and compared outcomes to those of conventional models (decision tree and Cox regression). Using a conventional decision tree model, the 3-month serum creatinine level post-transplant (cut-off, 1.65â€‰mg/dl) predicted a graft failure rate of 77.8% (index of concordance, 0.71). Using a survival decision tree model increased the index of concordance to 0.80, with the episode of acute rejection during the first year post-transplant being associated with a 4.27-fold increase in the risk of graft failure. Our study revealed that early acute rejection in the first year is associated with a substantially increased risk of graft failure. Machine learning methods may provide versatile and feasible tools for forecasting graft survival.",2017,Scientific Reports
The establishment of immune infiltration based novel recurrence predicting nomogram in prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer (PCa), a severe health burden for males, accounts for the second frequent cancer and fifth tumor specific death cancer around the world. Several studies on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) have shown inconsistent and controversial results to PCa. We downloaded a gene expression matrix and clinical information from TCGA, and CIBERSORT was used to identify the proportion of TIICs. Wilcoxon's Sign Rank Test evaluated different gene expression levels in PCa and normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate the associations of TIICs and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Finally, based on the preset P-value of .05, the distribution of TIICs in 73 PCa tissues and 11 normal tissues was illustrated. Activated CD4+ T cells and M0 macrophages account for a high proportion in PCa tissues, while neutrophils and monocytes were found at a high density in normal tissues. Further results showed that the density of plasma cells, Treg cells and resting mast cells were associated with advanced PCa. Additionally, M2 macrophages affected the RFS of PCa patients, and AR was also involved. In the current study, we first evaluated the immune infiltration among PCa and revealed that M2 macrophages could predict the prognosis of PCa patients. Meanwhile, based on the LASSO regression analysis, we established a novel nomogram to assess the recurrence risk of PCa based on immune cell proportions and clinical features.",2019,Cancer Medicine
Structured Compression of Deep Neural Networks with Debiased Elastic Group LASSO,"State-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are typically too cumbersome to be practically useful in portable electronic devices. As such, several works pursue model compression that seeks to drastically reduce computational memory footprints, FLOPS and memory for storage. Many of these works achieve unstructured compression, where the compressed models are not directly useful since dedicated hardware and specialized algorithms are required for storage of sparse weights and fast sparse matrix-vector multiplication respectively. In this paper, we propose structured compression of large DNNs using debiased elastic group LASSO (DEGL), which is motivated by different interesting characteristics of the individual components. That is, where group LASSO penalty enforces structured sparsity, l2-norm penalty promotes features grouping, and debiasing disentangles sparsity and shrinkage effects of group LASSO. We perform extensive experiments by applying DEGL to different DNN architectures including LeNet, VGG, AlexNet and ResNet on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our proposal on domain adaptation using Oxford-102 flower species and Food-5K datasets. Results show that DEGL can compress DNNs by several folds with small or no loss of performance. Particularly, DEGL outperforms conventional group LASSO and several other state-of-theart methods that perform structured compression.",2020,
Test data analytics â€” Exploring spatial and test-item correlations in production test data,"The discovery of patterns and correlations hidden in the test data could help reduce test time and cost. In this paper, we propose a methodology and supporting statistical regression tools that can exploit and utilize both spatial and inter-test-item correlations in the test data for test time and cost reduction. We first describe a statistical regression method, called group lasso, which can identify inter-test-item correlations from test data. After learning such correlations, some test items can be identified for removal from the test program without compromising test quality. An extended version of this method, weighted group lasso, allows taking into account the distinct test time/cost of each individual test item in the formulation as a weighted optimization problem. As a result, its solution would favor more costly test items for removal from the test program. We further integrate weighted group lasso with another statistical regression technique, virtual probe, which can learn spatial correlations of test data across a wafer. The integrated method could then utilize both spatial and inter-test-item correlations to maximize the number of test items whose values can be predicted without measurement. Experimental results of a high-volume industrial device show that utilizing both spatial and inter-test-item correlations can help reduce test time by up to 55%.",2013,2013 IEEE International Test Conference (ITC)
ModulaÃ§Ã£o da funÃ§Ã£o de macrÃ³fagos pela nattectina: uma lectina tipo C do veneno de Thalassophryne nattereri.,"ISHIZUKA, E. K. Modulation of macrophage function by Nattectin: a C-type lectin from Thalassophryne nattereri fish venom. 2011. 78 p. Masters thesis (Immunology) Instituto de CiÃªncias BiomÃ©dicas, Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, SÃ£o Paulo, 2011. Nattectin is a 15 kDa toxin isolated from Thalassophryne nattereri fish venom that has homology with C-type lectin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Nattectin ability to activate macrophage functions and the influence of Th1/Th2 cytokines in polarized activation of macrophages induced by Nattectin. Our results show that Nattectin was able to induce F4/80CD11bCD14Ly6C macrophage derived from bone marrow activation through CD40, CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules and MHC class II upregulation, and also an increase in integrins expression and endocytic capacity. It was found a positive dependence of Nattectin binding to glycosylated structures expressed in macrophages for induction of MHC class II, CD49a integrin expression and an increase in endocytic capacity. The expression of costimulatory molecules in macrophages was dependent the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and primarily PI3K signaling, while endocytic capacity and MMP-9 production was positively regulated through ERK1/2 signaling. We also demonstrated that phenotypic modifications in peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macropahges induced by Nattectin in C57BL/6 mice are consistent with classical (M1) activation of macrophages dependent on IL12 and IFN-Î³ cytokines, and negatively regulated by IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13. Finally, it was demonstrated an adjuvant role of IL-4 with IFN-Î³ in mobilization of SPMs (Small Peritoneal Macrophages) to peritoneal cavity and also in activation (expression of MHC class II and CCR7) of bone marrow-derived macrophages. Thus, Nattectin can be considered an important immunomodulatory agent able to modulate macrophage functions, useful in vaccines development and with therapeutic applications.",2011,
Simultaneous variable selection and parametric estimation for quantile regression,"Abstract In this paper, variable selection techniques in the linear quantile regression model are mainly considered. Based on the penalized quantile regression model, a one-step procedure that can simultaneously perform variable selection and coefficient estimation is proposed. The proposed procedure has three distinctive features: (1) By considering quantile regression, the set of relevant variables can vary across quantiles, thus making it more flexible to model heterogeneous data; (2) The one-step estimator has nice properties in both theory and practice. By applying SCAD penalty (Fan and Li, 2001) and Adaptive-LASSO penalty (Zou, 2006), we establish the oracle property for the sparse quantile regression under mild conditions. Computationally, the one-step estimator is fast, dramatically reducing the computation cost; (3) We suggest a BIC-like tuning parameter selector for the penalized quantile regression and demonstrate the consistency of this criterion. That is to say the true model can be identified consistently based on the BIC-like criterion, making our one-step estimator more reliable practically. Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to examine the finite-sample performance of this procedure. Finally, we conclude with a real data analysis. The results are promising.",2015,Journal of The Korean Statistical Society
Immunocytochemical and Ultrastructural Identification of Pituitary Cell Types in the Protogynous Thalassoma duperrey during Adult Sexual Ontogeny,"Abstract Protogynous wrasses (Thalassoma duperrey): females (F), primary males (PM) along with a few terminal-phase males (TM) and sex-changed males (SM), were used to characterize the topographical organization of the pituitary. In general, immunocytochemical and ultrastructural features of the adenohypo-physeal cell types of the saddleback wrasse pituitary resemble those of other teleosts. In the rostral pars distalis (RPD), corticotropic cells were found bordering the neurohypophysis (NH) and surrounding the centroventrally located prolactin cells. Thyrotropic cells formed a small group in the anteriodorsal part of the rostral and proximal pars distalis (PPD). The somatotropic cells were distributed in large clusters, mostly organized in cell cords around the interdigitations of the NH of the dorsal PPD. Cells containing gonadotropin Ib subunit were localized in the dorsal parts of the PPD, in close association with somatotropic cells and gonadotropin IIb subunit containing cells were seen in the centroventral parts of the PPD and along the periphery of the pars intermedia (PI). The pars intermedia was composed of melanotropic cells and somatolactin cells that lined the neurohypohysis. Distinct ultrastructural differences in corticotropic and somatotropic cells were not observed between the four groups. In all groups, prolactin cells in the ventral-most RPD could be immature cells or actively secreting prolactin. Gonadotropic II cells of PM and F had relatively higher incidence of â€œnuclear buddingâ€ and cell organelles compared to TM and SM. Besides gonadotropic, the active melanotropic and somatolactin cells might be associated with some aspect(s) of reproduction.",1998,

Hierarchical Convex Optimization by the Hybrid Steepest Descent Method with Proximal Splitting Operatorsâ€”Enhancements of SVM and Lasso,"The breakthrough ideas in the modern proximal splitting methodologies allow us to express the set of all minimizers of a superposition of multiple nonsmooth convex functions as the fixed point set of computable nonexpansive operators. In this paper, we present practical algorithmic strategies for the hierarchical convex optimization problems which require further strategic selection of a most desirable vector from the solution set of the standard convex optimization. The proposed algorithms are established by applying the hybrid steepest descent method to special nonexpansive operators designed through the art of proximal splitting. We also present applications of the proposed strategies to certain unexplored hierarchical enhancements of the support vector machine and the Lasso estimator.",2019,
In situ Gymnosperm pollen from the Middle Jurassic of Yorkshire,"In this paper the morphology of pollen grains yielded by male Gymnosperm fructifications from the Jurassic flora of Yorkshire is studied and discussed. Several new male fructifications were found and described: Hastystrobus gen. nov. was erected for male cones yielding the Eucommiidites type of pollen grains. This genus is monotypic and the type species Hastystrobus muirii yielded pollen grains that agree with Eucommiidites troedssonii. Hastystrobus muirii very probably has Cycadalean affinities, because the whole abaxial surface of the microsporophylls is covered with sporangia. For the first time the male fructification of Ginkgo huttoni (Heer) Sternberg is described. It resembles in general the male fructification of the recent Ginkgo biloba L., and the pollen grains agree with those of Ginkgo biloba. Male cones associated with Brachyphyllum crucis Kendall have been found and described. They yielded pollen grains that after short maceration were identifiable as Circulina, while after prolonged maceration they could be assigned to Classopollis multistriatus Burger. Brachyphyllum crucis is provisionally assigned to the Hirmerella-group on the basis of its male cone and pollen grains. The cones were compared with other male cones containing Classopollis pollen, which were also attributed to the Hirmerella-group. It is suggested that all members of the Hirmerella-group have an epidermis with a special type of stoma. Masculostrobus harrisii sp. nov. is described. This male cone resembles closely the male cone of Elatides williamsoni (Brgt) Sew., but its pollen grains are of the Inaperturopollenites-type, instead of the Perinopollenites-type. The new species Pityanthus scalbiensis yielding bisaccate pollen grains of a rather primitive type is described; there is almost no saccus infrastructure present. The Czekanowskia-group (including Leptostrobus and Solenites) in all probability does not belong to the Ginkgoales but to the Conifers. An interesting find was that the pollen grains of the Araucariaceous Brachyphyllum mamillare Brgt are of two types: In type 1 the nexine and sexine are attached to each other, while in type 2 the nexine is loose from the sexine and is somewhat shrunk. In the latter type also pollen grains were found that are somewhat trilobate. A similar dimorphism of pollen grains was also found in the recent Araucaria araucana (Molina) K. Koch. The pollen grains from the various male fructifications were compared with those from other male fructifications related to them. If the cones were assigned to recent taxa, the pollen grains were compared with recent pollen grains from those taxa (Cycadales, Ginkgoales and Coniferospermae). The pollen grains were also compared with dispersed pollen grains, mainly from the Jurassic.",1971,
Robust structure learning using multivariate T-distributions,"We address the issue of robust graph structure learning in continuous settings. We focus on sparse precision matrix estimation for its tractability and ability to reveal some measure of dependence between variables. For this purpose, we propose to extract good features from existing methods, namely tlasso and CLIME procedures. The former is based on the observation that standard Gaussian modelling results in procedures that are too sensitive to outliers and proposes the use of t-distributions as an alternative. The latter is an alternative to the popular Lasso optimization principle which can handle some of its limitations. We then combine these ideas into a new procedure referred to as tCLIME that can be seen as a modified tlassoalgorithm. Numerical performance is investigated using simulated data and reveals that tCLIME performs favorably comparedto the other standard methods.",2018,
Can peritumoral radiomics increase the efficiency of the prediction for lymph node metastasis in clinical stage T1 lung adenocarcinoma on CT?,"ObjectivesTo evaluate the efficiency of radiomics model on CT images of intratumoral and peritumoral lung parenchyma for preoperative prediction of lymph node (LN) metastasis in clinical stage T1 peripheral lung adenocarcinoma patients.MethodsThree hundred sixty-six peripheral lung adenocarcinoma patients with clinical stage T1 were evaluated using five CT scanners. For each patient, two volumes of interest (VOIs) on CT were defined as the gross tumor volume (GTV) and the peritumoral volume (PTV, 1.5Â cm around the tumor). One thousand nine hundred forty-six radiomic features were obtained from each VOI, and then refined for reproducibility and redundancy. The refined features were investigated for usefulness in building radiomic signatures by mRMR feature ranking method and LASSO classifier. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop a radiomic nomogram incorporating the radiomic signature and clinical parameters. The prediction performance was evaluated on the validation cohort.ResultsThe radiomic signatures using the features of GTV and PTV showed a good ability in predicting LN metastasis with an AUC of 0.829 (95% CI, 0.745â€“0.913) and 0.825 (95% CI, 0.733â€“0.918), respectively. By incorporating the features of GTV and PTV, the AUC of radiomic signature increased to 0.843 (95% CI, 0.770â€“0.916). The AUC of radiomic nomogram was 0.869 (95% CI, 0.800â€“0.938).ConclusionsRadiomic signatures of GTV and PTV both had a good prediction ability in the prediction of LN metastasis, and there is no significant difference of AUC between the two groups. The proposed nomogram can be conveniently used to facilitate the preoperative prediction of LN metastasis in T1 peripheral lung adenocarcinomas.Key Pointsâ€¢ Radiomics from peritumoral lung parenchyma increase the efficiency of the prediction for lymph node metastasis in clinical stage T1 lung adenocarcinoma on CT.â€¢ A radiomic nomogram was developed and validated to predict LN metastasis.â€¢ Different scan parameters on CT showed that radiomics signature had good predictive performance.",2019,European Radiology
Estimating the Lasso's Effective Noise,"Much of the theory for the lasso in the linear model Y = XÎ²âˆ—+Îµ hinges on the quantity 2â€–XÎµâ€–âˆž/n, which we call the lassoâ€™s effective noise. Among other things, the effective noise plays an important role in finite-sample bounds for the lasso, the calibration of the lassoâ€™s tuning parameter, and inference on the parameter vector Î²âˆ—. In this paper, we develop a bootstrap-based estimator of the quantiles of the effective noise. The estimator is fully data-driven, that is, does not require any additional tuning parameters.

Impact of Slow-Release Bacillus Sphaericus Granules on Mosquito Populations Followed in a Tropical Urban Environment,"ABSTRACT 
 A floating, slow-release, granular formulation of Bacillus sphaericus (Neide) was used to control mosquito larvae in two suburban areas of two tropical cities: Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. A circular area of 2 km2, diameter 1,600 m, was treated in each city using a similar, smaller area 1 km away as an untreated control. Mosquito captures were made in houses in four concentric circles, from the periphery to the center; each circle was 50 m in width. Mosquitoes were captured in CDC light traps or from human landings. More than 95% of the mosquitoes were Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae). The human landing catches provided twice as many mosquitoes as did the CDC traps/night/house. The treatments resulted in important reductions relative to the control area and to preintervention captures. The reduction was more prominent in the inner circle (up to 90%) than in the outer circle (50â€“70%), presumably because of the impact of immigrating mosquitoes from nontreated breeding sites around the intervention area. This effect was more pronounced for light trap catches than from human landings. The impact of treatment was also measured as the mean ratio of mosquito density in the two outer circles to that of the two inner circles. This ratio was âˆ¼1:1 before the intervention and reached 1:0.43 during the intervention. This comparison does not depend on the assumption that, in the absence of intervention, the mosquito population development in the two areas would have been identical, but does depend on the homogeneity of the intervention area. The study showed that it is possible to organize mosquito control in a tropical, urban environment by forming and rapidly training teams of young people to carry out the mosquito control mostly using a biopesticide that can be applied without any tools except an iron bar to lift lids on some cesspits.",2009,
"Impact of environmental factors on the dependency of litter biomass in carbon cycling of Hooghly estuary, India","Abstract Litterfall of the mangroves and its subsequent decomposition is an important mechanism in terms of productivity and nutrient cycle of that ecosystem. Present study emphasizes on the significance of litter biomass and role of environmental factors impacting this process. Mangrove litter undergoes degradation and decomposition and serves as the main source of carbon in different forms within the system, mangrove forests adjacent to the creeks at Sagar Island of the Hooghlyâ€“Matla estuarine ecosystem. This system receives a major load of carbon from adjacent mangrove forest in the form of litterfall throughout the year. Keeping in view the effect of environmental factors on litterfall and dynamics of carbon, machine learning method has been applied for this study. Different forms of carbon and environmental factors like temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen are estimated following standard procedure. Correlation, redundancy analysis and LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression are done in order to know the impact of environmental variables on carbon pool dynamics and effect of litterfall on the carbon pools in soil and water. The results reflect a strong correlation among the studied environmental factors and carbon pool dynamics.

The growing need for resilience measurements motivates this research, measurements that reflect the complex, dynamic features of welfare among populations living in shock-prone contexts. It presents insights from three measurement approaches to explore the dynamic, intra-annual effects of shocks on household well-being, mediated by household characteristics; one based on shock persistence, one based on the stochastic distribution of well-being, and one driven by machine learning algorithms and based on predictive power. The insights gained from the comparison of measurement approaches offer a fuller understanding of the factors driving resilience than any single approach on its own. The paper harnesses a novel data-set from the â€˜Measuring Indicators for Resilience Analysisâ€™ project, which, each month, tracks shocks and food security indicators for one year in a highly food insecure population in Malawi. Across approaches, our study consistently finds that shocks and food insecurity are very persistent, and that households living in the flood plains are more resilient. When focusing on specific shocks such as illness, the gender of the household head matters as-well. A broader search for predictors of food insecurity using LASSO and Random Forest algorithms uncovers other characteristics that affect resilience, such as the distance to drinking-water. The paper demonstrates how multiple complementary approaches can identify different but overlapping factors related to resilience, painting a fuller, richer picture. It also demonstrates the empirical benefits derived from using high-frequency data sets in the study of resilience.",2019,World Development
A distribution-based LASSO for a general single-index model,"A general single-index model with high-dimensional predictors is considered. Additive structure of the unknown link function and the error is not assumed in this model. The consistency of predictor selection and estimation is investigated in this model. The index is formulated in the sufficient dimension reduction framework. A distribution-based LASSO estimation is then suggested. When the dimension of predictors can diverge at a polynomial rate of the sample size, the consistency holds under an irrepresentable condition and mild conditions on the predictors. The new method has no requirement, other than independence from the predictors, for the distribution of the error. This property results in robustness of the new method against outliers in the response variable. The conventional consistency of index estimation is provided after the dimension is brought down to a value smaller than the sample size. The importance of the irrepresentable condition for the consistency, and the robustness are examined by a simulation study and two real-data examples.",2015,Science China Mathematics
"Cretaceous and Paleogene Palynological Successions at Zhongba,Tibet and Its Significance","Scarcity of the data on the Cretaceous and Paleogene sporo-pollen results in a poor understanding of palaeofloras, palaeovegetation, and palaeo-ecosystem in Tibet. This paper mainly analyzed sporo-pollen from the Cretaceous and Palaeogene sediments at Cuojiang, Zhongba County, which is located at the southern margin of the Laurasia continent. Two palynological assemblage zones were recognized from the section including, in ascending order, the Classopollis Execipollenites Cycadopites assemblage zone and the Pinuspollenites Quercoidites Trilobapollis assemblage zone. The both can be assigned to late Late Cretaceous or Santonian to Maastrichtian, and Paleogene, or Palaeocene to Eocene respectively. The Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary in this section might possibly locate between the Qubeiya Formation and the Quxia Formation. Pollen of needle-leafed trees flourished greatly; but some pollen such as abiespollenites, cedripites, piceapollis and tsugaepollenites were only present at top of the Quxia Formation and base of the Jialazi Formation, suggesting a paleoenvironmental event closely related to a certain tectonic activity, probably the beginning of the collision between Indian and Laurasian plates. The studied palynofloras can be compared with those in south China, but different from those in the northern margin of India, implying that the marine realm between India and Laurasia continents had been isolating floral communication of two continents by Eocene.",2008,Acta Geological Sinica
Toward a Unified Theory of Sparse Dimensionality Reduction in Euclidean Space,"Let Î¦âˆˆR<sup>m x n</sup> be a sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform [52] with column sparsity s. For a subset T of the unit sphere and Îµâˆˆ(0,1/2), we study settings for m,s to ensure E<sub>Î¦</sub> sup<sub>xâˆˆ T</sub> |Î¦ x|<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> - 1| < Îµ, i.e. so that Î¦ preserves the norm of every x âˆˆ T simultaneously and multiplicatively up to 1+Îµ. We introduce a new complexity parameter, which depends on the geometry of T, and show that it suffices to choose s and m such that this parameter is small. Our result is a sparse analog of Gordon's theorem, which was concerned with a dense Î¦ having i.i.d. Gaussian entries. We qualitatively unify several results related to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, subspace embeddings, and Fourier-based restricted isometries. Our work also implies new results in using the sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform in randomized linear algebra, compressed sensing, manifold learning, and constrained least squares problems such as the Lasso.",2015,ArXiv
"[The natural resources of the expedition bay as a basis for the creation of the health resort centre at the coast of the Peter the Great Bay, the Sea of Japan].","The present article presents characteristics of the therapeutic and health promoting potential of the Expedition Bay, (part of the Peter the Great Bay, the Sea of Japan), known to be a deposit of therapeutic sea muds. The great variety of local therapeutic natural resources, viz. sea muds, sea weeds, friendly climate, beeches, etc., can be used for the treatment and prevention of various diseases. The Expedition Bay was designated as a local area of recreational and therapeutic value that can be used as a basis for the creation and further development of the multi-field health resort centre (or medical spa) that would attract patients from other regions of Russia and the surrounding countries. The future centre would provide medical services based in the first place on the classical methods of climatic and peloid therapy, thalassotherapy (heliotherapy, aeroionotherapy, bathing, marine algae therapy, etc.) as well as the modern balneotherapeutic and spa technologies, therapeutic tourism for the purpose of rehabilitation and health promotion.",2014,"Voprosy kurortologii, fizioterapii, i lechebnoi fizicheskoi kultury"
Using Lasso for Predictor Selection and to Assuage Overfitting: A Method Long Overlooked in Behavioral Sciences.,"Ordinary least squares and stepwise selection are widespread in behavioral science research; however, these methods are well known to encounter overfitting problems such that R(2) and regression coefficients may be inflated while standard errors and p values may be deflated, ultimately reducing both the parsimony of the model and the generalizability of conclusions. More optimal methods for selecting predictors and estimating regression coefficients such as regularization methods (e.g., Lasso) have existed for decades, are widely implemented in other disciplines, and are available in mainstream software, yet, these methods are essentially invisible in the behavioral science literature while the use of sub optimal methods continues to proliferate. This paper discusses potential issues with standard statistical models, provides an introduction to regularization with specific details on both Lasso and its related predecessor ridge regression, provides an example analysis and code for running a Lasso analysis in R and SAS, and discusses limitations and related methods.",2015,Multivariate behavioral research
IBD: Faecal calprotectin testingâ€”the need for better standardization,Measurement of faecal calprotectin concentration is increasingly used to assess disease activity in patients with IBD.

Fast learning rates for sparse quantile regression problem,"Learning with coefficient-based regularization has attracted a considerable amount of attention recently in both machine learning and statistics. This paper presents a kernelized version of a quantile estimator integrated with coefficient-based regularization, which can be solved efficiently by a simple linear programming. Fast convergence rates are obtained under mild condition on the underlying distribution. Besides, this algorithm can be adapted easily to large scale problems and sparse solution is often achieved as that of Lasso. In our work we make the following main contributions: girst, improved learning rates are obtained by employing so called variance bounds, which is optimal in the literatures of learning theory; second, we establish stronger convergence rates by employing self-calibration inequalities; third, our learning rates can also be derived by a simple data-dependent parameter selection method; finally, the performance of the classical and our new algorithms are compared respectively in a simulation study and an actual problem.",2013,Neurocomputing
Detection of early stage pancreatic cancer using 5-hydroxymethylcytosine signatures in circulating cell free DNA,"Pancreatic cancers are typically diagnosed at late stage where disease prognosis is poor as exemplified by a 5-year survival rate of 8.2%. Earlier diagnosis would be beneficial by enabling surgical resection or earlier application of therapeutic regimens. We investigated the detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in a non-invasive manner by interrogating changes in 5-hydroxymethylation cytosine status (5hmC) of circulating cell free DNA in the plasma of a PDAC cohort (n=51) in comparison with a non-cancer cohort (n=41). We found that 5hmC sites are enriched in a disease and stage specific manner in exons, 3â€™UTRs and transcription termination sites. Our data show that 5hmC density is reduced in promoters and histone H3K4me3-associated sites with progressive disease suggesting increased transcriptional activity. 5hmC density is differentially represented in thousands of genes, and a stringently filtered set of the most significant genes points to biology related to pancreas (GATA4, GATA6, PROX1, ONECUT1) and/or cancer development (YAP1, TEAD1, PROX1, ONECUT1, ONECUT2, IGF1 and IGF2). Regularized regression models were built using 5hmC densities in statistically filtered genes or a comprehensive set of highly variable 5hmC counts in genes and performed with an AUC = 0.94-0.96 on training data. We were able to test the ability to classify PDAC and non-cancer samples with the Elastic net and Lasso models on two external pancreatic cancer 5hmC data sets and found validation performance to be AUC = 0.74-0.97. The findings suggest that 5hmC changes enable classification of PDAC patients with high fidelity and are worthy of further investigation on larger cohorts of patient samples.",2018,bioRxiv
Joint estimation of activity signal and HRF in fMRI using fused LASSO,"In this paper, we propose a novel voxel-based method for joint estimation of underlying activity signal and hemodynamic response function (HRF) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the proposed two stage iterative framework, fused-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Fused LASSO) penalty is utilized for activity detection and HRF estimation. Conditions of smoothness and sparsity are imposed on HRF for its estimation. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated on both synthetic and real fMRI data.",2015,2015 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)
The Sky is Falling If Judges Decide Religious Controversies! - Or is it? The German Experience of Religious Freedom under a Bill of Rights,"This chapter challenges the view often put forward by opponents of bills of rights that morally and politically controversial questions are for the elected Parliament alone and are not suitable for determination by courts. The challenge is based on an examination of two of the most controversial cases ever decided by the German Constitutional Court, the Classroom Cruzifix and the Teacher Headscarf Case, and the publicâ€™s reaction to these cases. The argument is divided into seven parts. Following the introductory section is an explanation of some fundamental aspects of the German constitutional system, including an introduction to the relevant principles of constitutional law and interpretation. This provides the background to the discussion of the guarantee of religious freedom under the German bill of rights and the Constitutional Court's approach to this guarantee in part three. The fourth section explores the Court's jurisprudence on the free exercise of religion in public schools, culminating in the Classoom Crucifix and Teacher Headscarf cases. Then, the public and scholarly debate surrounding these cases is portrayed. The next section explores empirical research that demonstrates that the Constitutional Courtâ€™s authority and reputation did not suffer long-term damage from being the target of much criticism. Likewise, the legal and political system of the Federal Republic of Germany did not suffer as a consequence of the Court's decisions. The chapter concludes that a mature legal and political system can survive highly charged controversies being decided by the courts unscathed, as demonstrated by the German experience. Therefore, the fact that courts may be drawn into controversial debates and become the object of public criticism is not a valid argument against a bill of rights.",2012,
The SIFK score: a validated predictive model for arthroplasty progression after subchondral insufficiency fractures of the knee,"The purpose of this study was to create a predictive model utilizing baseline demographic and radiographic characteristics for the likelihood that a patient with subchondral insufficiency fracture of the knee will progress to knee arthroplasty with emphasis on clinical interpretability and usability. A retrospective review of baseline and final radiographs in addition to MRIs were reviewed for evaluation of insufficiency fractures and associated injuries. Patient and radiographic factors were used in building predictive models for progression to arthroplasty with Train: Validation: Test subsets. Multiple models were compared with emphasis on clinical utility. Total of 249 patients with a mean age of 64.6 (SD 10.5) years were included. Knee arthroplasty rate was 27% at mean of 4 years of follow-up. Lasso Regression was non-inferior to other models and was chosen for ease of interpretability. In order of importance, predictors for progression to arthroplasty included lateral meniscus extrusion, Kellgrenâ€“Lawrence Grade 4, SIFK on MFC, lateral meniscus root tear, and medial meniscus extrusion. The final SIFK Score stratified patients into low-, medium-, and high-risk categories with arthroplasty rates of 8.8%, 40.4%, and 78.9% (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and an area under the curve of 82.5%. In this validated model, lateral meniscus extrusion, K-L Grade 4, SIFK on MFC, lateral meniscus root tear, and medial meniscus extrusion were the most important factors in predicting progression to arthroplasty (in that order). This model assists in patient treatment and counseling in providing prognostic information based on patient-specific risk factors by classifying them into a low-, medium-, and high-risk categories. This model can be used both by medical professionals treating musculoskeletal injuries in guiding patient decision making. Level III.",2019,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"
Estimation of average treatment effects with panel data: Asymptotic theory and implementation,"Hsiao, Ching and Wan (2012) propose a novel method to estimate the average treatment effect using panel data. In this paper, we accomplish the following: (i) We relax some of the distributional assumptions made in HCW and show that the HCW method works for a much wider range of data generating processes; (ii) We derive the asymptotic distribution of HCWâ€™s average treatment effect estimator which facilitates inference; (iii) When there exists a large number of control units, we propose using the LASSO method to select control units. We show that the LASSO method is computationally more efficient compared to conventional model selection criteria. Moreover, the LASSO method leads to more accurate out-of-sample prediction results than many commonly adopted approaches such as BIC, AIC, AICC and the leave-many-out cross validation methods (Du and Zhang, 2015).",2017,Journal of Econometrics

Prediction of COPD-specific health-related quality of life in primary care COPD patients: a prospective cohort study,"Background:Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is an important patient-reported outcome for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Aim:We developed models predicting chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ) dyspnoea, fatigue, emotional function, mastery and overall HRQL at 6 and 24 months using predictors easily available in primary care.Methods:We used the â€œleast absolute shrinkage and selection operatorâ€ (lasso) method to build the models and assessed their predictive performance. Results were displayed using nomograms.Results:For each domain-specific CRQ outcome, the corresponding score at baseline was the best predictor. Depending on the domain, these predictions could be improved by adding one to six other predictors, such as the other domain-specific CRQ scores, health status and depression score. To predict overall HRQL, fatigue and dyspnoea scores were the best predictors. Predicted and observed values were on average the same, indicating good calibration. Explained variance ranged from 0.23 to 0.58, indicating good discrimination.Conclusions:To predict COPD-specific HRQL in primary care COPD patients, previous HRQL was the best predictor in our models. Asking patients explicitly about dyspnoea, fatigue, depression and how they cope with COPD provides additional important information about future HRQL whereas FEV1 or other commonly used predictors add little to the prediction of HRQL.",2014,NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine

Linear scaling density matrix perturbation theory for basis-set-dependent quantum response calculations: an orthogonal formulation.,"Linear scaling density matrix perturbation theory [A. M. N. Niklasson and M. Challacombe, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 193001 (2004)] is extended to basis-set-dependent quantum response calculations for a nonorthogonal basis set representation. The generalization is achieved by a perturbation-dependent congruence transform, derived from the factorization of the inverse overlap matrix, which transforms the generalized eigenvalue problem to an orthogonal, standard form. With this orthogonalization transform the basis-set-dependent perturbation in the overlap matrix is included in the orthogonalized Hamiltonian, which is expanded in orders of the perturbation. In this way density matrix perturbation theory developed for an orthogonal representation can be applied also to basis-set-dependent response calculations. The method offers an alternative to the previous solution of the basis-set-dependent response problem, based on a nonorthogonal generalization of the density matrix perturbation theory, where the calculations are performed within a purely nonorthogonal setting [A. M. N. Niklasson et al., J. Chem. Phys. 123, 44107 (2005)].",2007,The Journal of chemical physics
Variational Bayes Group Sparse Time-Adaptive Parameter Estimation With Either Known or Unknown Sparsity Pattern,"In this paper, we study the problem of time-adaptive group sparse signal estimation from a Bayesian viewpoint. We propose two online variational Bayes schemes that are specifically designed to estimate and track group sparse signals in time. The proposed schemes address both the cases where the grouping information of the signal is either known or not. For the case of known group sparsity pattern, the proposed scheme builds on a novel hierarchical model for the Bayesian adaptive group lasso. Utilizing the variational Bayes framework, update equations for all model parameters are given, for both the batch and time adaptive estimation scenarios. To address the case where the group sparsity pattern is unknown, the hierarchical Bayesian model of the former scheme is extended by organizing the penalty parameters of the Bayesian lasso in a conditional autoregressive model. Intrinsic conditional autoregression is exploited to penalize the signal coefficients in a structured manner and thus obtain group sparse solutions automatically. Again, a robust and computationally efficient online variational Bayes estimator is developed, capitalizing on the conjugacy of the proposed hierarchical Bayesian formulation. Experimental results are reported that corroborate the superior estimation performance of the proposed online schemes, when compared with state-of-the-art methods.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing

What am I doing ? Initial stepstoward artificial cognition,"Within thefield of NeuroRoboticswe aredriven primarily by the desireto understandhow humansandanimalslive andgrow andsolve every dayâ€™s problems.To this aim we adopteda â€œlearn by doingâ€ approach by building artificial systems, e.g.robotsthatnotonly look likehumanbeingsbut alsorepresent amodelof somebrainprocess.They should, ideally, behaveandinteractlikehumanbeings(beingsituated).Themainemphasisin roboticshasbeenonsystemsthat actasa reactionto anexternalstimulus(e.g.tracking,reaching),ratherthanasaresultof aninternaldrive to exploreor â€œunderstandâ€theenvironment.Wethink it is now appropriateto try to move from acting,in thesenseexplainedabove, to â€œunderstandingâ€.As a startingpoint we addressedthe problemof learningabout the effectsandconsequencesof self-generatedactions.How doestherobot learnhow to pull anobjecttoward itself or to pushit away? How doesthe robot learnthatsphericalobjectsroll while a cubeonly slidesif pushed? Interactingwith objectsis importantbecause it implicitly exploresobjectrepresentation,event understand ing, andcanprovide definition of objecthood that could not begraspedwith a merepassi ve observationof theworld. Further, learningto understandwhatoneâ€™s own bodycan do is an essentialsteptoward learningby imitation.

The basic idea is that assemblingsomething ascomplex asa cognitive systemfrom scratchasa collectionof modulesis virtually impossible.Rather , as in humans,cognitive abilitiesdevelop over time layering over previousstagesof development. Development may therefore notbejust anartifactof biological systems,but a necessaryway to managecomplexity [9]. To this end we seethreebroadstagesin thedevelopmentof our humanoid robot platform: Thefirst stageinvolveslearninga body-image or body-schema[8] [11]. Having learned to distinguishits body from the restof the world the robot canmoveonto thesecondstage,whichis interactionwith external objects. Thethird andfinal stageinvolvesinterpretingobject-object interactions. An essential feature of this developmental programis thateachstagestrictly requires andlayers upon thepreviousstages.In this paper we presentresultsfor thesecondandthird stagesin this developmentalschema. Results from neurosciencesuggestthat action and manipulation are fundamentalfor acquiring knowledge aboutobjects[6] [4] [2]. Theseresultspoint out thataction andperception arepossiblymuchmore intertwined than what was oncebelieved. It would be difficult to draw a separationfor whereperception ends andaction starts. Even the distinctionbetweenmotor andsensory areastendsto beveryblurred. Drawing more from the neural scienceliterature, we now know thatareasactive whenreaching and/or grasping presenta mixed structure containing actionandsensoryrelatedneurons.Arbib andcolleagues[2] interpreted theseresponsesastheneural analogueof theaffordances of Gibson[5]. In Gibsonâ€™ stheory anaffordanceis avisual characteristicof anobjectwhichcanelicit anactionwithout necessarilyinvolving an objectrecognition stage. It seemsthatareasAIP (parietal) andF5 (premotor/frontal) areactive in sucha way to provide the individual with a mechanismto detectaffordances. F5 projectsto F1 (primary motor cortex) and can therefore control behavior. In particular areaAIP containsneuronsthatrespondboth whengener atinga graspingmovementandwhenobser ving theobjectbeinggrasped[4] [7].

Similarneuronswith slightly different temporal characteristicshave beenobservedin F5. Rizzolatti andcoworkers [4] extensively probed area F5. They found another classof graspingneurons that alsorespondedduringobservationof somebody elseâ€™ saction. They calledthis newly discoveredcellsmirror neurons. This activationof F5 is coherent with the ideathat thebraininternallyreproduces/simula testheobserved actions. This canpossiblyform the basisfor recognition of complicatedbiological motion andfor mimicry of observedbehaviors. Takentogether , theseresultssuggesthat theability to visually interpret themotor-goalor behavioral/purposeof theactionmaybehelpedby themonkeyâ€™s ability to perform thataction(andachieve a similarmotorgoal)itself. Therefore,active explorationof theenvironment maybe critical not only to subsequen t performanceof anaction, but alsofor theinterpretationof theactionsof others. We argued at the beginning of this sectionthat this â€œprobing/exploring activityâ€ is the secondstageof a developmentalsequence.

Discussion of Least Angle Regression,"Algorithms for simultaneous shrinkage and selection in regression and classifi cation provide attractive solutions to knotty old statistical challenges. N vertheless, as far as we can tell, Tibshiraniâ€™s Lasso algorithm has had little impac t on statistical practice. Two particular reasons for this may be the relative inefficienc y of the original Lasso algorithm, and the relative complexity of more recent Lasso algor ithms (e.g., Osbornet al., 2000). Efron, Hastie, Johnstone, and Tibshirani have provided an efficient, simple algorithm for the Lasso as well as algorithms for stage wiseregression and the new least angle regression. As such this paper is an important contribution to statistical computing.",2003,
Ethics of hyper-chaos: time without becoming and the emergence of the other,"Mapping the links between cinema and the anthropocene has become a central concern in film studies and, recently, scholars such as Irmgard Emmelhainz, David Martin-Jones, William Brown and Selmin Kara have developed various theoretical perspectives for a non-anthropocentric film philosophy. Nevertheless, the concepts of â€˜hyper-chaosâ€™ and â€˜absolute contingencyâ€™ developed by Quentin Meillassoux, and their capacity to address some of the ethical issues raised by cinema have not yet been explored. The focus of this paper is to suggest that Meillassouxâ€™s hyper-chaos redefines the condition of emergence of alterity, and thus provides an ethical framework for a non-anthropocentric bound of humanity and the world. In a universe ruled by the law of becoming, in which we experience incessant processes of becoming-other by experimenting the transformative potential of life, â€˜differenceâ€™ annihilates otherness, since the other is not what we become, but what is incessantly withdrawing, the inaccessible â€˜more than realâ€™. I argue the â€˜otherâ€™ can only arise, therefore, from aâ€™ time without becomingâ€™ or hyper-chaos, that Meillassoux speculates as a time that physics cannot conceive and that can destroy or create any substance or law, in an absolute contingency that knows no cause nor reason. In this contingent time, any law â€“ whether of nature or human â€“ being free from the principle of sufficient reason, is, therefore, a mere fact that is not regulated by any (meta)physical reasons. From this time only can a real â€˜otherâ€™ emerge, a radical â€˜otherâ€™ unreachable through any becoming. As an example of the emergence of such an absolute other, I discuss Rubber (Quentin Dupieux, 2011) in which the advent of life in an inanimate object, without cause and for no reason, forces us to reconsider our relation with the world in a universe ruled by absolute contingency.",2016,
Continua of (In)Justice,"In this piece I discuss both spatial and temporal relations of justice, through comparing understandings of â€˜continuaâ€™ in processul and originary descriptions of nature of law as having affect in, and giving affect to, dimensions of space and time . 
Processual understandings of justice are argued to be found in Andreas Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulosâ€™ â€˜lawscapingâ€™ and its â€˜continuumâ€™ in â€˜Spatial Justice: Body, Lawscape Atmosphereâ€™ (Routledge, 2015), where the ahistorical and affective nature of law is described, with no overt reference to an origin of justice, and a refutation of any â€˜outsideâ€™ to law. An originary notion of justice is argued in my own work â€˜Protest, Property and the Commons: Performances of Law and Resistanceâ€™ (Routledge, 2016), as supported buy the work of legal pluralist Boaventura de Sousa Santosâ€™ â€˜continuum of formalismâ€™ (â€˜The Law of the Oppressed: The Construction and Reproduction of Legality in Pasargadaâ€™, Law and Society Review, 1977). I argue the existence of informal laws that persist outside of state law, that at first can be resistant to state law but can become institutionalised into formal law. This relies on the supposition that there be a an exterior to law, an â€˜a-legal vacuumâ€™, posing the importance of the origin and history of law in conferring a notion of spatial justice. 
The work of speculative realists Quentin Meillassoux and Martin Hagglund is used to support the uncertain spatio-temporal nature of both informal and formal processes of law, highlighting the imbrication of both time and space within spatial justice, through the agential role of in entropy (linear and nonlinear conceptions of time), arguing the inherent nature of uncertainty as (in)justice itself.",2018,
Bayesian variable selection in additive partial linear models,"Many studies in recent time include a large number of predictor variables, but typically only a few of the predictors have significant roles. Variable selection techniques have been developed using both non-Bayesian and Bayesian approaches. Additive partial linear models (APLM) provide a flexible yet manageable extension of linear models, where some variables can have non-linear effects. We develop a Bayesian method for variable selection for APLM by expanding the non-linear functions in a polynomial basis and introducing sparsity by allowing point masses in the prior distribution of regression coefficients. We address variable selection for both linear and non-linear parts. The nonsingular part of the prior is given by a Laplace or multivariate Laplace density depending on whether the predictor has only a linear effect or a general effect. However, instead of using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, which are extremely slow in high dimensional models, we use Laplace approximation technique around posterior mode, which can be identified with the group lasso solution. We conduct a simulation study and present real data analysis for a nutritional epidemiology study and prostate cancer data.",2013,
Technical and Social Considerations of Tools from Roman-period Ceramic Workshops at Sagalassos (Southwest Turkey): Not Just Tools of the Trade?,"Archaeology has maintained a long-standing interest in â€˜the toolâ€™. In light of recent theoretical approaches to tools and technology, this paper presents the results of material analysis on a corpus of artifacts used in red-slipped ceramic production from Roman-period Sagalassos in southwest Turkey. Conceptual themes concern technological choices and the process by which tools were selected and appropriated for use in ceramic production. The tools demonstrate a variety of activity patternsâ€”from reuse and adaptation to design and production. Objects were accordingly employed in complex and creative ways to meet the technical requirements of the artisan. Such needs in some instances also seem to reflect the role of the individual artisan within the organization of the workshop, whereby individuals demarcated their own toolsets within a larger production setting. Patterns of adaptation also highlight a need for interpretive flexibility when assigning functionality and social meaning to material culture. Such processes of selection appear to have been socially situated within the broader urban, suburban, and rural material worlds of Sagalassos.",2012,Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology
"Mechanisms of autoprotection and the role of stress-proteins in natural defenses, autoprotection, and salutogenesis.","We hypothesize that in all physiotherapeutically oriented procedures of naturotherapy -- such as helio-, climate-, thalasso- or hydrotherapy or certain forms of physical exercise -- the transient expression of stress-proteins (heat-shock proteins, HSPs) is an important element of salutogenesis. These therapeutical procedures all cause a transitory 'disturbance' by an unspecific stressor that leads to functional responses. These functional responses can be trained and thus increase the forces and the capacity for resistance of the organism. The autoprotective mechanisms which we want to deal with in more detail are based on the functions of the heat-shock proteins (HSPs, stress-response proteins, 'chaperones') and represent archaic autoprotective responses. In addition, more complex mechanisms of autoprotection seem to have evolved that may play a role in the natural defenses against disease and which show a hierarchy of various genomically conserved strategies with different time-constants and time windows. This becomes apparent by studying autoprotective responses of the cardiovascular system of warm-blooded animals under ischemic stress. Recent extensive experimental protocols and clinical observations in elucidating the molecular basis of cardiac ischemia show that powerful autoprotective mechanisms are involved in the phenomena of 'hibernation', 'stunning', and 'ischemic preconditioning'. The system of the heat-shock proteins may therefore be regarded as a basic model for the principle of autoprotection and salutogenesis.",1998,Medical hypotheses
Effects of fish feeding by snorkellers on the density and size distribution of fishes in a Mediterranean marine protected area,"Although there is a great deal of evidence to show that supplementary feeding by humans in terrestrial environments causes pronounced changes in the distribution and behaviour of wild animals, at present very little is known about the potential for such effects on marine fish. This study evaluated the consequences of feeding by snorkellers on fish assemblages in the no-take area of the Ustica Island marine protected area (MPA; western Mediterranean) by (1) determining if reef fish assemblage structure is affected in space and time by tourists feeding the fish; (2) assessing the effects of feeding on the abundance of the most common fish species; and (3) assessing the effects of feeding on the size structure of the two most numerically dominant ones. In particular, we hypothesised that both the abundance and the size structure of some fish species would increase at the study site following supplementary feeding, since the additional food provided by humans would make the site more appealing to them. Fish feeding influenced the fish assemblages within the Ustica MPA, and significant spatio-temporal changes occurred. While fish feeding appeared to have no effect on the ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo, there was a noticeable increase in the number of Oblada melanura and Epinephelus marginatus in the impacted location after feeding. It is very likely that aggregations of fishes that evolve as a result of fish feeding by the public may have negative effects on local populations of fishes and invertebrates that make up their prey. Recreational use of coastal areas and MPAs is increasing elsewhere, making fish feeding a generalised human activity. Accurate information about its effect on the fish assemblage is essential to make responsible management decisions.",2005,Marine Biology
Short-Term Forecasting of CO2 Emission Intensity in Power Grids by Machine Learning,"A machine learning algorithm is developed to forecast the CO2 emission intensities in electrical power grids in the Danish bidding zone DK2, distinguishing between average and marginal emissions. The analysis was done on data set comprised of a large number (473) of explanatory variables such as power production, demand, import, weather conditions etc. collected from selected neighboring zones. The number was reduced to less than 50 using both LASSO (a penalized linear regression analysis) and a forward feature selection algorithm. Three linear regression models that capture different aspects of the data (non-linearities and coupling of variables etc.) were created and combined into a final model using Softmax weighted average. Cross-validation is performed for debiasing and autoregressive moving average model (ARIMA) implemented to correct the residuals, making the final model the variant with exogenous inputs (ARIMAX). The forecasts with the corresponding uncertainties are given for two time horizons, below and above six hours. Marginal emissions came up independent of any conditions in the DK2 zone, suggesting that the marginal generators are located in the neighbouring zones. 
The developed methodology can be applied to any bidding zone in the European electricity network without requiring detailed knowledge about the zone.",2020,ArXiv

"Molecular Characteristics and Epidemiology of Meningococcal Carriage, Burkina Faso, 2003","To describe Neisseria meningitidis strains in the African meningitis belt in 2003, we obtained 2,389 oropharyngeal swabs at 5 monthly visits a representative population sample (age range 4-29 years) in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. A total of 152 carriage isolates were grouped, serotyped, and genotyped. Most isolates were NG:NT:NST sequence type (ST) 192 (63% of all N. meningitidis), followed by W135:2a:P1.5,2 of ST-11 (16%) and NG:15:P1.6 of ST-198 (12%). We also found ST-2881 (W135:NT:P1.5,2), ST-751 (X:NT:P1.5), and ST-4375 (Y:14:P1.5,2) but not serogroups A or C. Estimated average duration of carriage was 30 days (95% confidence interval 24-36 days). In the context of endemic group W135 and meningococcal A disease, we found substantial diversity in strains carried, including all strains currently involved in meningitis in this population, except for serogroup A. These findings show the need for large samples and a longitudinal design for N. meningitidis serogroup A carriage studies.",2007,Emerging Infectious Diseases
A Modification of the Koppen Criteria for Determining Seasonal Distribution of Precipitation,"University of California, Berkeley According to the Koppen climatic classification, tho differentiation of humid and dry climates is dopendent upon the three variables: procipitation regime, total annual precipitation, and moan annual temperature. In applying all three of thoso variables in a study of climatic variability in the western United Statos, it was found that tho Koppen criteria for precipitation regime were unsatisfactory. The dopondenco of the regime upon the amounts of precipitation of a single month in each of tho two seasons means that the oceurronco of little or no rain in one winter month and in ono summer month automatically classos tho station as having a uniform regime, irrespective of tho seasonal totnls. R. J. Russell, in a study oÃ­ tho dry climates of the United Statos published in tho University of California Publications in Geography, volume 5, 1D31, prisscntod a modification of these criteria, This is, however, too elaborate for uso in connection with climatic variability since, according to it, a station may bo classified as any ono of twenty-seven different types in successive years. Russell, in his method, considers only two of the three months of each season because he fools that the use of all three would give too much weight to erratic months. ?? examination of climatic records readily shows that the consideration of only two months instead of three will give greater weight to an ""erratic"" month. The record of Ricardo, Texas, will illustrate this point.",1935,Yearbook of the Association of Pacific Coast Geographers
"Structural and biological characterization of Nattectin, a new C-type lectin from the venomous fish Thalassophryne nattereri.","Lectins are glycan-binding receptors that recognize glycan epitopes on foreign pathogens and in the host systems. They can be involved in functions that include innate immunity, development, immune regulation and homeostasis. Several lectins have been purified and characterized from fish species. In this work, using cation-exchange chromatography, a galactose-specific lectin belonging to the family of C-type lectins was isolated from the venom of the Brazilian venomous fish Thalassophryne nattereri. Nattectin is a basic, non-glycosilated, 15Â kDa monomeric protein. It exhibits hemagglutination activity that is independent of Ca(2+). We also demonstrated a lectin activity for Nattectin in the innate immune system, especially in neutrophil mobilization in mice, indicating that marine organisms are source of immunomodulator agents.",2011,Biochimie
Attack intensity by two species of territorial damselfish (Pomacentridae) as estimates of competitive overlap with two species of wrasse (Labridae),"The intensity of interspecific territorial defense should be based upon the degree of competitive overlap. We tested this relationship in two territorial Caribbean damselfish (dusky, Stegastes adustus, and longfin, S. diencaeous) with intruders being the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifascatus) and the slippery dick wrasse (Halichoeres bivittatus). Based on food habits, the slippery dick and the bluehead wrasse should have the same degree of competitive overlap to the two damselfish species. We also predicted that the larger slippery dick wrasse intruder would receive more aggression than the smaller bluehead wrasse intruder. Neither damselfish species distinguished between the two wrasses suggesting that they were ecologically equivalent. We also tested size differences within both species of wrasse and found that size had no influence on the aggression in the dusky damselfish. The longfin also did not show a size preference for the bluehead but did prefer to attack the larger slippery dick wrasse. In spite of the similarities between the dusky and the longfin damselfish and the similar food habits of the bluehead and the slippery dick wrasse, our results suggest that using intensity of interspecific territorial defense alone may not be an adequate measure of competitive overlap.",2013,Journal of Ethology
SIS: An R Package for Sure Independence Screening in Ultrahigh-Dimensional Statistical Models,"We revisit sure independence screening procedures for variable selection in generalized linear models and the Cox proportional hazards model. Through the publicly available R package SIS, we provide a unified environment to carry out variable selection using iterative sure independence screening (ISIS) and all of its variants. For the regularization steps in the ISIS recruiting process, available penalties include the LASSO, SCAD, and MCP while the implemented variants for the screening steps are sample splitting, data-driven thresholding, and combinations thereof. Performance of these feature selection techniques is investigated by means of real and simulated data sets, where we find considerable improvements in terms of model selection and computational time between our algorithms and traditional penalized pseudo-likelihood methods applied directly to the full set of covariates.",2018,Journal of Statistical Software
Middle Paleolithic Skill Level and the Individual Knapper: an Experiment,"It has been proposed that Paleolithic studies should abandon their focus on groups and turn instead to the individual. If 
individuals are to emerge from the lithics-dominated Middle Paleolithic record, the best chance of success is to identify the 
products of learner knappers from those of their mentors. To do so we need a framework of knapping standards by which 
to measure Middle Paleolithic skill level. Selected measurements on a sequence of 100 subcircular Levallois tortoise core 
reductions by a knapper of intermediate skill were compared with 25 reductions by his highly experienced instructor. Four 
measures emerge as potential markers of skill level: total stone consumption during initial core preparation, consumption 
from the upper and lower core surface, symmetry of the first detached Levallois flake, and failure rate of that detachment 
by overshooting the coreâ€™s rim. These markers allow us to discriminate between the work of a modern learner and his mentor, but >30 percent were misclassified. The learning trajectory is more complex than the mere honing of skills through practice and is punctuated by increasing numbers of mentor-like reductions. It follows that skill-level measures on their own are 
imperfect discriminators. Personal markers other than those of skill level must be found by which to seek individuals in the 
Middle Paleolithic record. 
Se ha propuesto que los estudios del Paleolitico deberian centrarse en el individuo y no en el grupo social. Una manera de 
conseguir que el individuo surja del registro del paleolitico medio, que es predominantemente litico, es a traves de la diferenciacion entre productos de talla litica del aprendiz y del maestro. Para ello, es necesario construir un marco referencial de 
estandares de talla que mida el nivel de destreza requerido para talla durante el paleolitico medio. En este trabajo se han realizado las medidas correspondientes en una secuencia de 100 reducciones de nucleo Levallois de tortuga subcircular llevadas 
a cabo por un individuo con un nivel intermedio de experiencia. Estas medidas fueron comparadas con 25 reducciones realizadas por el instructor de dicho individuo, quien contaba con un alto nivel de experiencia. Como resultado, se obtuvieron 
cuatro medidas como marcadores del nivel de experiencia: el consumo total de la piedra durante la preparacion inicial del 
nucleo, el consumo de la superficie superior e inferior del nucleo, la simetria de la primera lasca levallois, y la tasa de error 
de dicha extraccion al sobrepasar el borde del nucleo. Estos marcadores nos permiten discriminar entre el trabajo de un principiante y su maestro en la actualidad; sin embargo, >30% quedan fuera de esta clasificacion. La trayectoria de aprendizaje 
comporta mas complejidad que la mera acumulacion de destreza a partir de la practica, manifestandose a traves de un aumento 
en el numero de extracciones de experto. Se deduce que las medidas del nivel de destreza porsisolasson discriminantesimperfectos para identificar al individuo. Para llegar a reconocer al individuo en el registro del paleolitico medio se deben reconocer marcadores personales adicionales aparte del nivel de destreza",2011,American Antiquity
Consistent multiple changepoint estimation with fused Gaussian graphical models,"We consider the consistency properties of a regularised estimator for the simultaneous identification of both changepoints and graphical dependency structure in multivariate time-series. Traditionally, estimation of Gaussian graphical models (GGM) is performed in an i.i.d setting. More recently, such models have been extended to allow for changes in the distribution, but primarily where changepoints are known a priori. In this work, we study the Group-Fused Graphical Lasso (GFGL) which penalises partial correlations with an L1 penalty while simultaneously inducing block-wise smoothness over time to detect multiple changepoints. We present a proof of consistency for the estimator, both in terms of changepoints, and the structure of the graphical models in each segment. We contrast our results, which are based on a global, i.e. graph-wide likelihood, with those previously obtained for performing dynamic graph estimation at a node-wise (or neighbourhood) level.",2020,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
The Bayesian Group Lasso for Confounded Spatial Data,"Generalized linear mixed models for spatial processes are widely used in applied statistics. In many applications of the spatial generalized linear mixed model (SGLMM), the goal is to obtain inference about regression coefficients while achieving optimal predictive ability. When implementing the SGLMM, multicollinearity among covariates and the spatial random effects can make computation challenging and influence inference. We present a Bayesian group lasso prior with a single tuning parameter that can be chosen to optimize predictive ability of the SGLMM and jointly regularize the regression coefficients and spatial random effect. We implement the group lasso SGLMM using efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms and demonstrate how multicollinearity among covariates and the spatial random effect can be monitored as a derived quantity. To test our method, we compared several parameterizations of the SGLMM using simulated data and two examples from plant ecology and disease ecology. In all examples, problematic levels multicollinearity occurred and influenced sampling efficiency and inference. We found that the group lasso prior resulted in roughly twice the effective sample size for MCMC samples of regression coefficients and can have higher and less variable predictive accuracy based on out-of-sample data when compared to the standard SGLMM.Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.",2017,"Journal of Agricultural, Biological and Environmental Statistics"
Using correlation based adaptive LASSO algorithm to develop QSPR of antitumour agents for DNA-drug binding prediction,"Abstract In the United States, cancer is the second leading cause of death. Worldwide too, cancer is a major health problem. Hence, treatment of cancerous tumors remains a matter of very high concern. Apart from surgical treatment, the most commonly employed treatment is chemotherapy. But, due to long-term side effects such as organ damage and loss of teeth, doctors and patients are interested in treatments with reduced side effects. So far, a reasonably acceptable alternative to chemotherapy has not emerged. Recently, 9-anilinoacridines were evaluated as potential antitumor agents due to their enhanced tendency of DNA binding. For an initial evaluation of the drug performance, the association constant, K, is considered to be the key DNA drug binding property. In our work, to reduce experimental efforts and the associated chemical footprint, we develop a QSPR to model K. In our work, to model K, we utilized descriptors requiring representation of molecular structures in two dimensions or less. To establish a relationship between the descriptors and K, we have developed a correlation based adaptive LASSO algorithm (CorrLASSO). CorrLASSO, like LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), incorporates feature selection as part of the learning procedure. Also, it is useful for dealing with high-dimensional data. As an improvement, CorrLASSO evaluates correlation between descriptors/features and the dependent property to generate a model with high performance metrics. In our work, R2, Q2 and MSE (mean square error) were utilized as performance metrics.",2019,Computers & Chemical Engineering

The Pathogenesis of Autologous Immune Complex Glomerulonephritis in Rats,"Over 11 years has elapsed since the term autologous immune complex nephritis (AICN) was initially proposed to describe the pathogenetic mechanisms operative in an experimental membranous glomerulopathy induced in rats by active immunization with renal tubular epithelial (RTE) antigens in Freundâ€™s complete adjuvant. In this experimental model, which was originally described by Heymann and co-workers (Heymann et al., 1959), it was envisaged that circulating immune complexes (CIC) composed of autoantibodies to a specific proximal RTE antigen (designated RTE Î±5) and autologous RTE Î±5 deposited continuously in the glomerular capillaries (Edgington et al., 1967a). These CIC ultimately localized in the subepithelial space and provoked the typical morphologic and clinical features of membranous glomerulopathy including granular deposits of immunoglobulin and subepithelial electron-dense deposits in glomeruli (Glassock et al., 1968). Since then, a number of additional autologous antigen-antibody systems capable of evoking glomerular injury have been described in both animals and man (Naruse et al., 1973; Couser et al., 1974; Oâ€™Regan et al., 1976).",1983,
Weakly hierarchical lasso based learning to rank in best answer prediction,"In community question and answering sites, pairs of questions and their high-quality answers (like best answers selected by askers) can be valuable knowledge available to others. However lots of questions receive multiple answers but askers do not label either one as the accepted or best one even when some replies answer their questions. To solve this problem, high-quality answer prediction or best answer prediction has been one of important topics in social media. These user-generated answers often consist of multiple â€œviewsâ€, each capturing different (albeit related) information (e.g., expertise of the asker, length of the answer, etc.). Such views interact with each other in complex manners that should carry a lot of information for distinguishing a potential best answer from others. Little existing work has exploited such interactions for better prediction. To explicitly model these information, we propose a new learning-to-rank method, ranking support vector machine (RankSVM) with weakly hierarchical lasso in this paper. The evaluation of the approach was done using data from Stack Overflow. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach has superior performance compared with approaches in state-of-the-art.",2016,2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)
Prioritize Transcription Factor Binding Sites for Multiple Co-Expressed Gene Sets Based on Lasso Multinomial Regression Models,Computational prediction of cis-regulatory elements for a set of co-expressed genes based on sequence analysis provides an overwhelming volume of potential transcription factor binding sites. It presents a challenge to prioritize a set of functional transcription factors and their binding sites on the regulatory regions of the target genes that are relevant to the gene expression study. A novel approach based on the use of lasso multinomial regression models is proposed to address this problem. We examine the ability of the lasso models using a time-course microarray data obtained from a comprehensive study of gene expression profiles in skin and mucosal in mouse over all stages of wound healing.,2016,
Outland Empire : Prolegomena to Speculative Absolutism,"In what follows we shall outline a possible definition of speculative philosophy by reactivating, distorting and entangling four regulative concepts of German idealism, namely the absolute, the (philosophical) system, phenomenology (of â€˜spiritâ€™) and (absolute) knowledge. According to the speculative knot that we shall propose, knowledge will be locally inscribed in the philosophical system, the latter being a free falling organon for forcing the phenomenological mediation of the immanent and concrete self-experience of the absolute. Far from simply rejecting the Kantian legacy and its contemporary avatars, the activation of such a post-critical conception of philosophy requires us to overcome the reactive pre-modern components of critical philosophy and to direct the resulting weapon of criticism towards a truly transcendental dehumanization of experience. Indeed, from a historical point of view, the critical motif inaugurated by Kant has been split by a crucial ambiguity. On the one hand, the Kantian project of exponentiating the Copernican revolution to an infinite series of transcendental powers constitutes an unavoidable regulative idea for the infinite tasks of (absolute) knowledge. The legitimate project of constructing an unconditional and universal rational knowledge of the real will remain intrinsically limited by a transcendental anthropocentrism if the subject of science does not perform a reflexive analysis on the different â€˜transcendentalâ€™ conditions of research. However, instead of directing this necessary reflection on the transcendental localization of the subject of science towards a truly transcendental Copernican revolution, the critical motif has mainly triggered a â€˜Ptolemaic counterrevolutionâ€™ (Meillassoux) that seeks to preserve the pre-modern landscape and stitch up the cosmological narcissistic wound. Rather than accepting that a genuine transcendental revolution is nothing but the angelic beginning of inhuman terror, even Kant used his critique to demonstrate that science would never be able to sublate the",2015,
"No pain, no gain : measuring treatment effects in fibromyalgia","Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is a condition of chronic pain, fatigue and other symptoms without a known anatomical substrate. Until now, treatment is mostly unsatisfactory; empirical studies on pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies in FM are needed. Following an overview of FM and its treatment, two such trials are described in this thesis. 
The first one is a pre-randomised clinical trial of spa treatment in FM. A combination of thalassotherapy, physical exercise and patient education in a Tunisian spa resort improved FM symptoms and health-related quality of life. 
Differences between spa treatment (n = 58) and treatment-as-usual (n = 76) were statistically significant after 3 months, but not after 6 and 12 months. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis showed no significantly different costs in the spa and control group, except for the cost of spa treatment (â‚¬ 1,526). Quality of life was higher in the spa group: 0.04 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) based on the visual analogue scale for general health (p< 0.01). The incremental cost-utility ratio after 6 months of follow-up was â‚¬ 1,311 / 0.04 = â‚¬ 32,775 per QALY gained (95% confidence interval -375,000 to 273,000). 
The second study is a 6-week double-blind randomised controlled trial comparing venlafaxine 75 mg/day (n = 45) to placebo (n = 45). The results of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) suggested a positive effect. Primary 
outcome measures (McGill Pain Questionnaire and visual analogue painscales) improved by 10%. However, no statistically significant differences between venlafaxine and placebo were seen. The importance of placebo effects in many FM drug trials is discussed separately. 
The combined data from both trials were used to validate a Dutch translation of the FIQ, which showed sufficient reliability, construct validity and responsiveness to be recommended as an outcome measure in FM. 
The studies described in this thesis show that empirical studies in FM are feasible and determination of effects and effect sizes is possible.",2007,

Strain HST28T showed morphological and chemotaxonomic features in line with its classification in the genus Streptomyces . Optimal growth of strain HST28T was obtained at 28â€‰Â°C, pH 8-9 and up to 10â€Š% (w/v) NaCl. Single (16S rRNA) and multi-locus gene sequence analyses showed that strain HST28T had a distinct phylogenetic position from its closest relatives, the type strains of Steptomyces aureus and Streptomyces kanamyceticus. Digital DNA-DNA hybridization (23.3 and 31.0â€Š%) and average nucleotide identity (79.3 and 85.6â€Š%) values between strain HST28T and its corresponding relatives mentioned above were below the threshold of 70 and 96â€Š%, respectively, defined for assigning a prokaryotic strains to the same species. Strain HST28T was characterised by the presence of ll-diaminopimelic acid in its peptidoglycan layer; galactose, glucose, ribose and traces of arabinose and mannose as whole-cell sugars; phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, aminolipid, glycophospholipid and an unidentified lipid as polar lipids; and the predominating menaquinones MK-9(H6), MK-9(H8) and MK-9(H4) (>20â€Š%) as well as anteiso-C15â€Š:â€Š0 and anteiso-C17â€Š:â€Š0 as major fatty acids (>15â€Š%).

Inguinal hernia repair by single-incision pediatric endosurgery (SIPES) using the hydrodissection-lasso technique,"Many different techniques for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair have been introduced recently, using either an intraperitoneal [1â€“3] or an extraperitoneal [4â€“6] approach. One of the main challenges is to obtain a complete circumferential closure of the sack at the level of the internal ring without injury to the adjacent vas deferens or spermatic vessels. In an effort to separate these structures from the peritoneum before passing a suture around the base of the sack, we developed the hydrodissection-lasso technique, which is performed using a single-incision endosurgical approach.With the patient in Trendelenburg position, an 8-mm skin incision is made in the umbilicus, and a 5-mm trocar is placed in the inferior aspect for the endoscope. A 3-mm Maryland grasper is placed directly through the fascia in the upper part of the incision. Using a 22-gauge needle inserted percutaneously over the internal inguinal ring, saline is injected into the subperitoneal plane circumferentially, hydrodissecting the peritoneum off the vas deferens and vessels and creating a safe space through which the suture can pass without compromising these structures. A 2-mm stab incision is made directly over the internal inguinal ring, and a lasso technique is used to pass two strands of braided polyester suture around the hernia sack, as demonstrated in the video. Both sutures are tied tightly, leaving the knots under the skin. No direct or indirect manipulation of the vas deferens or vessels takes place during any part of the procedure.In contrast to other described techniques [7], the hydrodissection-lasso technique can be used for all indirect inguinal hernias in both girls and boys, and hydrodissection itself may be a useful adjunct to any of the other aforementioned techniques. Although an age limit for exclusive high ligation of the hernia sack for indirect inguinal hernias has not been established, the recurrence rate may be higher for adults if the procedure is not combined with inguinal floor reconstruction [8]. At this time, we therefore limit the proposed technique to prepubertal patients.We have performed the described procedure for 22 patients without any recurrences during a maximum follow-up period of 12Â months (TableÂ 1). The patients had minimal postoperative pain. There were no complications except for a transient genitofemoral nerve paresis experienced by one girl in whom the hydrodissection was performed using 1% lidocaine instead of the usual normal saline solution. Although the sack was not resected, there were no cases of postoperative hydroceles.To evaluate whether this novel technique is an adequate long-term solution, a prospective clinical trial comparing standard open and single-incision endosurgical inguinal hernia repair using hydrodissection should be performed.",2011,Surgical Endoscopy
Acoustic Features for Classification Based Speech Separation,"Speech separation can be effectively formulated as a binary classification problem. A classification based system produces a binary mask using acoustic features in each time-frequency unit. So far, only pitch and amplitude modulation spectrogram have been used as unit level features. In this paper, we study other acoustic features and show that they can significantly improve both voiced and unvoiced speech separation performance. To further explore complementarity in terms of discriminative power, we propose a group Lasso approach for feature combination. The final combined feature set yields promising results in both matched and unmatched test conditions.",2012,
A predictive maintenance system based on regularization methods for ion-implantation,"Ion Implantation is one of the most sensitive processes in Semiconductor Manufacturing. It consists in impacting accelerated ions with a material substrate and is performed by an Implanter tool. The major maintenance issue of such tool concerns the breaking of the tungsten filament contained within the ion source of the tool. This kind of fault can happen on a weekly basis, and the associated maintenance operations can last up to 3 hours. It is important to optimize the maintenance activities by synchronizing the Filament change operations with other minor maintenance interventions. In this paper, a Predictive Maintenance (PdM) system is proposed to tackle such issue; the filament lifetime is estimated on a statistical basis exploiting the knowledge of physical variables acting on the process. Given the high-dimensionality of the data, the statistical modeling has been based on Regularization Methods: Lasso, Ridge Regression and Elastic Nets. The predictive performances of the aforementioned regularization methods and of the proposed PdM module have been tested on actual productive semiconductor data.",2012,2012 SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference

Samples were 627 critically ill patients, based on information in their medical records. They admitted in the intensive care during May to June 2010, and 799 critically ill patients during October - December 2010. The applied tool included ICU bed management guideline and secondary data from chart. Statistics methods employed were frequency, percentage and compared average bed occupancy, bed turnover rate and length of stay before and after the development of ICU bed utilization. Comparison of their differences were made by using t-test and the effectiveness of bed utilization was established by using Pabon lasso method. The finding after the development showed that the average of bed occupancy was 88.72 and 86.08 percentage, the average of bed turnover was 6.03 and 6.10 per bed (per month) and the average of length of stay was at 4.14 and 3.96 days showing no significant differences (p<0.05). Analysis of the effective bed utilization showed that medical intensive care unit had bed turn over at a high rate, length of stay was short but the rate of bed occupancy was low. Moreover, the intermediate intensive care unit 1 had a high rate of bed occupancy but the rate of bed turnover was low and length of stay was long. Besides, the intermediate intensive care unit 2 had bed occupancy and turnover at a high rate and the length of stay was short The study revealed that the development and management of ICU bed utilization were an effective guideline in order to improve. Therefore, there should be a monitoring process every month in order to evaluate and improve the cause of insufficient indicators and further develop ICU bed utilization system.

The discovery of deep-water seagrass meadows in a pristine Indian Ocean wilderness revealed by tracking green turtles.,"Our understanding of global seagrass ecosystems comes largely from regions characterized by human impacts with limited data from habitats defined as notionally pristine. Seagrass assessments also largely focus on shallow-water coastal habitats with comparatively few studies on offshore deep-water seagrasses. We satellite tracked green turtles (Chelonia mydas), which are known to forage on seagrasses, to a remote, pristine deep-water environment in the Western Indian Ocean, the Great Chagos Bank, which lies in the heart of one of the world's largest marine protected areas (MPAs). Subsequently we used in-situ SCUBA and baited video surveys to survey the day-time sites occupied by turtles and discovered extensive monospecific seagrass meadows of Thalassodendron ciliatum. At three sites that extended over 128â€¯km, mean seagrass cover was 74% (mean range 67-88% across the 3 sites at depths to 29â€¯m. The mean species richness of fish in seagrass meadows was 11 species per site (mean range 8-14 across the 3 sites). High fish abundance (e.g. Siganus sutor: mean MaxN.site-1â€¯=â€¯38.0, SDâ€¯=â€¯53.7, nâ€¯=â€¯5) and large predatory shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) (mean MaxN.site-1â€¯=â€¯1.5, SDâ€¯=â€¯0.4, nâ€¯=â€¯5) were recorded at all sites. Such observations of seagrass meadows with large top predators, are limited in the literature. Given that the Great Chagos Bank extends over approximately 12,500â€¯km2 and many other large deep submerged banks exist across the world's oceans, our results suggest that deep-water seagrass may be far more abundant than previously suspected.",2018,Marine pollution bulletin
A simple method for deriving the confidence regions for the penalized Coxâ€™s model via the minimand perturbation,"ABSTRACT We propose a minimand perturbation method to derive the confidence regions for the regularized estimators for the Coxâ€™s proportional hazards model. Although the regularized estimation procedure produces a more stable point estimate, it remains challenging to provide an interval estimator or an analytic variance estimator for the associated point estimate. Based on the sandwich formula, the current variance estimator provides a simple approximation, but its finite-sample performance is not entirely satisfactory. Besides, the sandwich formula can only provide variance estimates for the non zero coefficients. In this article, we present a generic description for the perturbation method and then introduce a computation algorithm using the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our method can better approximate the limiting distribution of the adaptive LASSO estimator and produces more accurate inference compared with the sandwich formula. The simulation results also indicate the possibility of extending the applications to the adaptive elastic-net penalty. We further demonstrate our method using data from a Phase III clinical trial in prostate cancer.",2017,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
Comparison of whole genome prediction accuracy across generations using parametric and semi parametric methods,"Accuracy of genomic prediction was compared using three parametric and semi parametric methods, including BayesA, Bayesian LASSO and Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regression under various levels of heritability (0.15, 0.3 and 0.45), different number of markers (500, 750 and 1000) and generation intervals of validating set. A historical population of 1000 individuals with equal sex ratio was simulated for 100 generations at constant size. It followed by 100 extra generations of gradually reducing size down to 500 individuals in generation 200. Individuals of generation 200 were mated randomly for 10 more generations applying litter size of 5 to expand the historical generation. Finally, 50 males and 500 females chosen from generation 210 were randomly mated to generate 10 more generations of recent population. Individuals born in generation 211 considered as the training set while the validation set was composed of individuals either from generations 213, 215 or 217. The genome comprised one chromosome of 100 cM length carrying 50 QTLs. There was no significant difference between accuracy of investigated methods (p > 0.05) but among three methods, the highest mean accuracy (0.659) was observed for BayesA. By increasing the heritability, the average genomic accuracy increased from 0.53 to 0.75 (p < 0.05). The number of SNPs affected the accuracy and accuracies increased as number of SNPs increased; therefore, the highest accuracy was for the case number of SNPs=1000. With getting away from validating set, the accuracies decreased and the most severe decay observed in the case of low heritability. Decreasing the accuracy across generations affected by marker density but was independent from investigated methods.",2016,Acta Scientiarum. Animal Sciences
"Fuzzy Viewshed Analysis of the Hellenistic City Defence System at Sagalassos, Turkey","This paper presents the results of the interdisciplinary study of the Hellenistic outer defences at the site of Sagalassos. The aim of this study was to analyse the reciprocal relation and intervisibility of a small part of the Hellenistic outer defences, i.e. a fortress and two watchtowers on the mountain tops immediately north and southwest of the city, and the main north and south approaches to the city. This analysis uses a GIS, thus combining archaeology, computer science and geography. Because of the deceptive accuracy of binary viewshed maps, fuzzy viewsheds were calculated. Two types of viewsheds, projective and reflective, were produced. Because of the sensitivity to the positioning of the observation points of the projective viewsheds, it was decided to also calculate reflective viewsheds. Both projective and reflective viewsheds show that the different towers guard a well defined part of the main north and south approaches to the city. It also became clear that the visibility of the different watchtowers interact, and that they can be integrated into a single system, thus indicating a contemporaneous date for all elements of this system of outer defences. The results of the method used in this study, seems promising enough to further develop and apply it. Also the drawbacks of both projective and reflective viewsheds become clear, leading to the conclusion that a combination of these two types of viewshed often offers the best view on the visibility in the study area.",1997,
Workflow forever: semantic web semantic models and tools for preserving and digitally publishing computational experiments,"One of the main challenges for biomedical research lies in the integrative study of large and increasingly complex combinations of data in order to understand molecular mechanisms, for instance to explain the onset and progression of human diseases. Computer-assisted methodology is needed to perform these studies, posing new challenges for upholding scientific quality standards for the reproducibility of science. This pertains to the preservation of the 'materials and methods' of computational experiments as a record of the evidence for the biological interpretation of their results. We argue that traditional journal publication is no longer sufficient, and propose a methodology based on the workflow paradigm, Semantic Web models, and Digital Library infrastructure.
 Our primary goal is to enable the preservation of the necessary and sufficient information for researchers to understand the steps of a computational experiment that led to new biological insight, at any point in the future. Central to our approach is the development of a 'Research Object' (RO) model that captures this information for preservation, publication and acknowledgement. We adopted a combination of a Semantic Web and Digital Library approach for the representation and publication of such a model. The RO model can be viewed as an artifact that aggregates and annotates a number of resources that are used and/or produced in a given scientific investigation. The figure below (Figure 1) illustrates a high level description of the elements that are needed to specify a research object.
 A resource can be a workflow, web service, document, data item, data set, workflow run, software or a research object. Instead of building a new model, we use the Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) for specifying aggregation of resources, and Annotation Ontology (AO) for their annotations. ORE defines standards for the description and exchange of aggregations of Web resources. For example, a Research Object can be defined as an ore:Aggregation, and an ore:ResourceMap can be used to describe the research object and its constituent resources (ro:ResearchObject a owhClass; rdfs:subClassOf ore:Aggregation). Annotations in a RO are specified using the Annotation Ontology, which provides a common model for document metadata, typically for annotating electronic documents or parts of electronic documents. Together with domain-specific vocabularies that extend the generic RO model we can specifically annotate the roles of the individual resources. We aim to develop tooling that facilitates annotation at each step of the research cycle, harvesting metadata from users in small steps.
 We present an example of an instantiated prototype RO in the context of a study of Metabolic Syndrome, for which we perform computational experiments that help interpret Genome Wide Association Data by using a special text mining method [1]. While we conceived the experiment, designed and performed it, we populated the prototype RO model and annotated the entities to describe their role and their interrelationships. For instance, we defined that 'a particular ranked list of candidate biological processes was produced by a particular workflow run', for which we assert that 'this particular workflow run is a run instance of a specific GWAS Interpretation Workflow', and 'a specific Text Mining Web Service is used in this particular GWAS Interpretation Workflow', while 'a particular GWAS data set is input to the workflow run'. We also defined that the 'RO is created by Kristina Hettne', 'created at a particular time and date', 'motivated by a particular hypothesis', and 'the result is interpretated through a particular change in the hypothesis'. ROs can also refer to previous work of which the output was used in the experiment. ROs may be related to each other and other resources, which can create a graph of scientific progress.
 The results presented here are the outcomes of the EU FP7 project 'Wf4Ever that aims to provide tools and recommendations for digitally preserving computational experiments.",2011,

3 Greedy Variance Estimation â€“ The Orthonormal Case,"Recent results have proven the minimax optimality of LASSO and related algorithms for noisy linear regression. However, these results tend to rely on variance estimators that are inefficient or optimizations that are slower than LASSO itself. We propose an efficient estimator for the noise variance in high dimensional linear regression that is faster than LASSO, only requiring p matrix-vector multiplications. We prove this estimator is consistent with a good rate of convergence, under the condition that the design matrix satisfies the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). In practice, our estimator scales incredibly well into high dimensions, is highly parallelizable, and only incurs a modest bias.",2018,

"The influence of population density on the mating system of Thalassoma pavo, a protogynous Mediterranean labrid fish",". The aim of the present study is to determine the factor balancing the reproductive polymorphism obServed in Thalassoma pavo, a Mediterranean labrid fish that shows two sexually distinct types of males: small gonochoristic males and large sex-changed males. Large males defend specific mating sites above which females come to spawn. In such a mating system (pair spawning performed only by large territorial males), small males almost never get the opportunity to spawn. In a similar situation, Thalassoma bifasciatum, a coral reef species, shows a change of its mating system due to the influence of population density. As the population density grows, the proportion of small males in the population increases until they are numerous enough to take over a mating site where they perform group spawns. Concerning Thalassoma pavo, neither the group spawning behavior nor any other factor has ever been described to explain the maintenance of the two types of males.",1991,Marine Ecology
Urban Migrants and Rural Development,"Rural development in parts of Nigeria is a function of two comparable, if not, coordinate variables: the government and the townsmen residing in the urban areas. The government provides the access roads, runs schools and health clinics or hospitals built by the townsmen. These urban migrants, as we shall henceforth refer to them for reasons to be explained later, in addition to providing other infrastructural facilities, are the political and economic backbone of the rural communities as well as their source of modernization. Smock (1971) dwelt upon the political and modernity role of ethnic unions in Nigerian cities. She showed how these unions ""facilitated the accommodation between tradition and modernity in the Eastern political system...,"" linked ""traditional commitments with the modern political and administrative structures,"" and prevented discontinuities, a characteristic feature of transitional political systems. For Smock, urban migrants, successfully manipulated tradition to politically modernize their rural villages. Little (1970) reasoned slightly differently. He saw the major functions of urban associations as the adaptation of traditional institutions and the integration of institutions whose raison d'&tre is alien to traditional culture. These associations nurtured political leaders and the formation of political parties resulting in modernist ambition and nationalist aspirations for self-government. Meillassoux (1968) perceived urban migrants associations, or voluntary associations as he referred to them, as the mechanism by which the migrants approached the problems of social security and created new social networks. Meillassoux also saw a clear nexus between the norms of these associations and their rural origins in terms of their derivation, their roots, and their purposes. It is mainly from this rural-urban link that we shall approach our present discussion. This paper shall also show that the psychological and sociophysical condition in the urban area, the acceptance that the city is a place for austere living and endurance of rough conditions all combine to prepare psychically urban migrants for their role in the economic maintenance and improvemeht of their home rural communities. The Igbo migrants from east of the River Niger are the focal point of this paper since they serve to illustrate the above. Urban sociology literature usually labels such groups of people as rural migrants. This paper, however, terms them urban migrants in order to denote the transciency by which the group perceives itself in the Nigerian situation and to call attention to the fact that while the",1982,African Studies Review
Structural basis of leader peptide recognition in lasso peptide biosynthesis pathway.,"Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) with a unique 3D-interlocked structure, in which an N-terminal macrolactam ring is threaded by a linear C-terminal part. The unique structure of lasso peptides is introduced into ribosomally translated precursor peptides by lasso peptide synthetase encompassing proteins B and C or B1, B2, and C when the B enzyme is split into two distinct proteins. The B1 protein recognizes the leader sequence of the precursor peptide, and then the B2 protein cleaves it. The C protein catalyzes the formation of the macrolactam ring. However, the detailed mechanism of lasso peptide maturation has remained elusive, due to the lack of structural information about the responsible proteins. Here we report the crystal structure of the B1 protein from the thermophilic actinobacteria, Thermobifida fusca (TfuB1), complexed with the leader peptide (TfuA-Leader), which revealed the detailed mechanism of leader peptide recognition...",2019,ACS Chemical Biology
Genome-wide prediction of traits with different genetic architecture through efficient variable selection.,"In genome-based prediction there is considerable uncertainty about the statistical model and method required to maximize prediction accuracy. For traits influenced by a small number of quantitative trait loci (QTL), predictions are expected to benefit from methods performing variable selection [e.g., BayesB or the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)] compared to methods distributing effects across the genome [ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP)]. We investigate the assumptions underlying successful variable selection by combining computer simulations with large-scale experimental data sets from rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and Arabidopsis thaliana (L.). We demonstrate that variable selection can be successful when the number of phenotyped individuals is much larger than the number of causal mutations contributing to the trait. We show that the sample size required for efficient variable selection increases dramatically with decreasing trait heritabilities and increasing extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD). We contrast and discuss contradictory results from simulation and experimental studies with respect to superiority of variable selection methods over RR-BLUP. Our results demonstrate that due to long-range LD, medium heritabilities, and small sample sizes, superiority of variable selection methods cannot be expected in plant breeding populations even for traits like FRIGIDA gene expression in Arabidopsis and flowering time in rice, assumed to be influenced by a few major QTL. We extend our conclusions to the analysis of whole-genome sequence data and infer upper bounds for the number of causal mutations which can be identified by LASSO. Our results have major impact on the choice of statistical method needed to make credible inferences about genetic architecture and prediction accuracy of complex traits.",2013,Genetics

LPV Model Order Selection from Noise-corrupted Output and Scheduling Signal Measurements,"Abstract In parametric identification of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems, it is important to achieve a low variance of the model estimate by limiting the number of parameters to be identified. This is the well known â€œmodel order selectionâ€ problem, which consists of selecting the number of input and output delays and the basis functions characterizing the dependence of the LPV model parameters on the scheduling signal. Ignoring the effect of noise on the observations of the scheduling signals may lead to a bias in the final estimate and, as a consequence, also to an incorrect selection of the model order. In this paper, we introduce a â€œbias-corrected cost functionâ€ for the identification of LPV systems from noise-corrupted observations of the output and scheduling variable. The introduced cost function provides a bias-free parameter estimation along with model order selection. The proposed identification approach has two main advantages: (i) the problem of model order selection can be handled by adding a LASSO-like penalty term to the bias-corrected cost function; (ii) it provides a bias-free cost as a criterion to tune some hyper-parameters influencing the final parameter estimate.",2017,IFAC-PapersOnLine
Two-Layer Feature Reduction for Sparse-Group Lasso via Decomposition of Convex Sets,"Sparse-Group Lasso (SGL) has been shown to be a powerful regression technique for simultaneously discovering group and within-group sparse patterns by using a combination of the l1 and l2 norms. However, in large-scale applications, the complexity of the regularizers entails great computational challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel two-layer feature reduction method (TLFre) for SGL via a decomposition of its dual feasible set. The two-layer reduction is able to quickly identify the inactive groups and the inactive features, respectively, which are guaranteed to be absent from the sparse representation and can be removed from the optimization. Existing feature reduction methods are only applicable for sparse models with one sparsity-inducing regularizer. To our best knowledge, TLFre is the first one that is capable of dealing with multiple sparsity-inducing regularizers. Moreover, TLFre has a very low computational cost and can be integrated with any existing solvers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that TLFre improves the efficiency of SGL by orders of magnitude.",2014,ArXiv
Diffusion tensor imaging for characterizing tumor microstructure and improving diagnostic performance on breast MRI: a prospective observational study,"BackgroundDiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can increase breast MRI diagnostic specificity due to the tendency of malignancies to restrict diffusion. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides further information over conventional DWI regarding diffusion directionality and anisotropy. Our study evaluates DTI features of suspicious breast lesions detected on MRI to determine the added diagnostic value of DTI for breast imaging.MethodsWith IRB approval, we prospectively enrolled patients over a 3-year period who had suspicious (BI-RADS category 4 or 5) MRI-detected breast lesions with histopathological results. Patients underwent multiparametric 3â€‰T MRI with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and DTI sequences. Clinical factors (age, menopausal status, breast density, clinical indication, background parenchymal enhancement) and DCE-MRI lesion parameters (size, type, presence of washout, BI-RADS category) were recorded prospectively by interpreting radiologists. DTI parameters (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], fractional anisotropy [FA], axial diffusivity [Î»1], radial diffusivity [(Î»2â€‰+â€‰Î»3)/2], and empirical difference [Î»1â€‰âˆ’â€‰Î»3]) were measured retrospectively. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods were used for univariate and multivariate logistic regression, respectively. Diagnostic performance was internally validated using the area under the curve (AUC) with bootstrap adjustment.ResultsThe study included 238 suspicious breast lesions (95 malignant, 143 benign) in 194 women. In univariate analysis, lower ADC, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were associated with malignancy (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.37â€“0.42 per 1-SD increase, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 for each), as was higher FA (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.45, pâ€‰=â€‰0.007). In multivariate analysis, LASSO selected only ADC (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.41) as a predictor for a DTI-only model, while both ADC (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.41) and FA (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.88) were selected for a model combining clinical and imaging parameters. Post-hoc analysis revealed varying association of FA with malignancy depending on the lesion type. The combined model (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.81) had a significantly better performance than Clinical/DCE-MRI-only (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.76, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and DTI-only (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.75, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) models.ConclusionsDTI significantly improves diagnostic performance in multivariate modeling. ADC is the most important diffusion parameter for distinguishing benign and malignant breast lesions, while anisotropy measures may help further characterize tumor microstructure and microenvironment.",2019,Breast Cancer Research : BCR
"LASSOPACK and PDSLASSO: Prediction, model selection and causal inference with regularized regression","The field of machine learning is attracting increasing attention among social scientists and economists. At the same time, Stata offers to date only a very limited set of machine learning tools. This one-hour session introduces two Stata packages, lassopack and pdslasso, which implement regularized regression methods, including but not limited to the lasso (Tibshirani 1996 Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B), for Stata. The packages include features intended for prediction, model selection and causal inference, and are thus applicable in a wide range of settings. The commands allow for high-dimensional models, where the number of regressors may be large or even exceed the number of observations under the assumption of sparsity. The package lassopack implements lasso, square-root lasso (Belloni et al. 2011 Biometrika; 2014 Annals of Statistics), elastic net (Zou and Hastie 2005 Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B), ridge regression (Hoerl and Kennard 1970 Technometrics), adaptive lasso (Zou 2006 Journal of the American Statistical Association) and post-estimation OLS. These methods rely on tuning parameters, which determine the degree and type of penalization. lassopack supports three approaches for selecting these tuning parameters: information criteria (implemented in lasso2), K-fold and h-step ahead rolling cross-validation (cvlasso), and theory-driven penalization (rlasso) due to Belloni et al. (2012 Econometrica). In addition, rlasso implements the Chernozhukov et al. (2013 Annals of Statistics) sup-score test of joint significance of the regressors.",2018,
