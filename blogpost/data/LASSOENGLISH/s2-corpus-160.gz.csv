Simulations stochastiques par rapiÃ©Ã§age de motifsavec contrÃ´le des statistiques,"RESUME : Dans cette these, nous presentons deux methodes de simulation stochastique qui procedent de maniere similaire a la construction d'un casse-tete en assemblant des morceaux carres d'image, d'ou le nom de simulations stochastiques par rapiecage de motifs. Les morceaux sont preleves dans une image de reference qui fournit les informations sur les proprietes statistiques du champ aleatoire a reproduire. Nos methodes de simulation mettent l'accent sur la continuite des motifs lors du rapiecage. De plus, nos methodes de simulation permettent de respecter la presence de donnees conditionnantes (hard data). Pour ce conditionnement, nous limitons le choix des morceaux d'image a ceux qui respectent les donnees conditionnantes. 
Afin d'eviter le probleme de derive des statistiques, nous presentons une methode de controle reposant sur le controle de l'histogramme de la moyenne locale. Pour controler cet histogramme, nous classons dans une partition les morceaux de l'image de reference en fonction de la valeur moyenne de leurs pixels. En plus de pouvoir reproduire l'histogramme de la moyenne locale de l'image de reference, les simulations peuvent reproduire un histogramme quelconque defini par l'usager. La premiere methode de simulation, appelee patchwork simulation method (PSM), procede de gauche a droite et de haut en bas en collant des morceaux d'image de l'image de reference. Cette methode de simulation est apparentee a un champ de Markov ou le controle de la moyenne locale s'effectue en choisissant adequatement les probabilites de transition. La deuxieme methode de simulation, appelee corrective pattern-matching simulation (CPMS), procede en effectuant des corrections de maniere iterative. Cette methode est apparentee a un algorithme glouton, car a chaque etape elle apporte une correction a un emplacement presentant une grande erreur dans l'objectif de tendre vers un optimum global. Pour differents types d'images de synthese et pour une image d'un melange de polymere, nous montrons que nos simulations respectent les donnees conditionnantes, reproduisent l'aspect visuel des images de reference et permettent d'obtenir des histogrammes de la moyenne locale qui sont statistiquement conforme a l'histogramme vise.----------ABSTRACT : In this thesis, we present two stochastic simulation methods which build two-dimensional images by assembling together square image pieces like a jigsaw puzzle. The image pieces are taken from a reference image that provides the statistical information on the simulated field. Our methods emphasize pattern continuity in the simulated image. This is achieved by suitably selecting the image pieces to fit to the existing data. Our simulations are also constrained to respect conditional data called \emph{hard data}. This conditioning is achieved by limiting the image pieces drawn from the reference image to the pieces that honor the hard data. To avoid statistical drift in our simulation methods, we introduce different ways to control the local-mean histogram. The local-mean is the average value of the pixels in a square image piece. The statistical control is achieved by partitioning all the possible image pieces of the reference image according to their local-mean. The simulations can then reproduce the local-mean histogram of the reference image. Furthermore, the simulations can also reproduce a user-defined local-mean histogram and thus produce original random fields. The first simulation method, called patchwork simulation method (PSM), proceeds unilaterally by sticking image pieces from left to right and from top to bottom. In the PSM, the local-mean histogram control is achieved by suitably adjusting the transition probabilities that associate the added data to an existing neighborhood in the partly simulated image. The second simulation method, called corrective pattern-matching simulation (CPMS), proceeds iteratively by making local corrections to the simulated image. The CPMS proceeds as a greedy algorithm in the sense that, at each step, the simulation corrects a location that presents a large error in the hope to tend towards a global optimum.For several types of synthetic images and one polymer blend image, we show that our simulations respect the conditioning data, reproduce faithfully the visual appearance of the reference images and are statistically compatible with the target local-mean histograms.",2013,
"A Late-Hadrianic Nymphaeum at Sagalassos (Pisidia, Turkey) : A Preliminary Report","In the Pisidian city Sagalassos a nymphaeum once mentioned at the end of the 19 th century was excavated in 2004 and 2005. The building, which is located on a prominent position between upper and lower city, has yielded the majority of its architectural remains and a substantial amount of the original sculptural assemblage in a relatively good preservation. Furthermore, epigraphic evidence in the form of inscribed statue bases can be associated with the nymphaeum, so that its architectural, artistic and social context can be entirely revealed. The nymphaeum constructed in the late Hadrianic period, illuminates a particular programmatic intent linked to a member of the local elite. After his will, the nymphaeum was erected and adorned with a sculptural arrangement characterized through an eclecticism in style and statue types. The assemblage, centered on a colossal statue of Apollo Kitharodos, was composed of ideal and portrait statues whereof the latters is only preserved a female statue of the Large-Herculanean type.",2007,
Ureteral stents: exchange under fluoroscopic control as an effective alternative to cystoscopy.,"From September 1991 to February 1993, in 83 patients (74 women and nine men, aged 24-86 years), 166 double-J ureteral stents (initially placed to treat fistulas or stenoses located within the inferior third of the ureter) were exchanged during 127 procedures. Stents were extracted from the bladder through the urethra under fluoroscopic monitoring by using a lasso made of a 0.018-inch guide wire and a 7-F catheter. Then a new stent was placed over a 0.035-inch guide wire that had been previously coiled in the renal pelvis. Exchange was successful in 161 (97%) of 165 stents.",1994,Radiology
An integrated approach to validating ChIP-Seq using A * Lasso for Sparse Bayesian Network Learning,"Mapping the transcription network is integral to our understanding of the transcriptional regulation in cells. Recently, ChIP-Seq experiments have become popular to determine the regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TF) and its target genes by detecting physical binding. However, these experiments are noisy and many binding events are not actually functional. Instead of doing further laboratory experiments which are expensive and not realistic for humans, we propose to estimate a sparse Bayesian network structure of the TFs and target genes, and detect SNPs that perturb the network. These SNP perturbations provide evidence of functional bindings. To learn the sparse Bayesian network, we present A* lasso, a single stage method that recovers the optimal sparse Bayesian network structure by solving a single optimization problem with A* search algorithm that uses lasso in its scoring system. Our approach substantially improves the computational efficiency of the well-known exact methods based on dynamic programming. In addition, to make the method more practical for settings that have a large number of variables, we suggest a heuristic scheme that dramatically reduces computational time without substantially compromising the quality of solutions. We apply our method to integrate SNP, expression and ChIP-Seq data. We detect several influential SNPs in our network, and are able to provide evidence for TF binding and characterize the effect on the surrounding network.",2014,
Bayesian adaptive Lasso for quantile regression models with nonignorably missing response data,"Abstract Handling data with the nonignorably missing mechanism is still a challenging problem in statistics. In this paper, we develop a fully Bayesian adaptive Lasso approach for quantile regression models with nonignorably missing response data, where the nonignorable missingness mechanism is specified by a logistic regression model. The proposed method extends the Bayesian Lasso by allowing different penalization parameters for different regression coefficients. Furthermore, a hybrid algorithm that combined the Gibbs sampler and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is implemented to simulate the parameters from posterior distributions, mainly including regression coefficients, shrinkage coefficients, parameters in the non-ignorable missing models. Finally, some simulation studies and a real example are used to illustrate the proposed methodology.",2019,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation
Unsupervised Pool-Based Active Learning for Linear Regression,"In many real-world machine learning applications, unlabeled data can be easily obtained, but it is very time-consuming and/or expensive to label them. So, it is desirable to be able to select the optimal samples to label, so that a good machine learning model can be trained from a minimum amount of labeled data. Active learning (AL) has been widely used for this purpose. However, most existing AL approaches are supervised: they train an initial model from a small amount of labeled samples, query new samples based on the model, and then update the model iteratively. Few of them have considered the completely unsupervised AL problem, i.e., starting from zero, how to optimally select the very first few samples to label, without knowing any label information at all. This problem is very challenging, as no label information can be utilized. This paper studies unsupervised pool-based AL for linear regression problems. We propose a novel AL approach that considers simultaneously the informativeness, representativeness, and diversity, three essential criteria in AL. Extensive experiments on 14 datasets from various application domains, using three different linear regression models (ridge regression, LASSO, and linear support vector regression), demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",2020,ArXiv
The Importance of Ideology varies across Sociocultural Contexts,"Author(s): Chen, Eric Evan | Advisor(s): Ditto, Peter H | Abstract: Although ideology is widely studied, less is known about how it varies across sociocultural contexts. Ideology is an organizing structure for political attitudes in that positions on a core set of political attitudes have been found to be aligned along a liberal-conservative ideological dimension. Some personality-based approaches to political psychology suggest that, because ideology arises from low-level psychological features, the political attitudinal structure of ideology is likely to be consistent across sociocultural contexts. However, the cultural psychology perspective suggests that both low-level psychological features and their higher-level political attitudinal manifestations may differ across cultures. The five studies in this dissertation examined this tension using eight datasets from the General Social Survey, applying linear and logistic regression and lasso regression, and the machine learning techniques of random forest classification and regression and support vector machine classification. Across these studies, the importance of ideology as an organizing structure varied across sociocultural contexts, especially across race, education, and income lines. The associations between ideological self-placement and measures of political attitudes were weaker for those with lower incomes and with no college education, and the associations were almost entirely absent for Black Americans. In addition, this dissertation examined other ways that political concerns are prioritized, beyond ideology.",2017,
Sparsity Learning Formulations for Mining,"Traditional clustering and feature selection methods consider the data matrix as static. However, the data matrices evolve smoothly over time in many applications. A simple approach to learn from these time-evolving data matrices is to analyze them separately. Such strategy ignores the time-dependent nature of the underlying data. In this paper, we propose two formulations for evolutionary co-clustering and feature selection based on the fused Lasso regularization. The evolutionary co-clustering formulation is able to identify smoothly varying hidden block structures embedded into the matrices along the temporal dimension. Our formulation is very flexible and allows for imposing smoothness constraints over only one dimension of the data matrices. The evolutionary feature selection formulation can uncover shared features in clustering from time-evolving data matrices. We show that the optimization problems involved are non-convex, non-smooth and non-separable. To compute the solutions efficiently, we develop a two-step procedure that optimizes the objective function iteratively. We evaluate the proposed formulations using the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas data. Results show that our formulations consistently outperform prior methods.

High-dimensional generalized linear models and the lasso,"We consider high-dimensional generalized linear models with Lipschitz loss functions, and prove a nonasymptotic oracle inequality for the empirical risk minimizer with Lasso penalty. The penalty is based on the coefficients in the linear predictor, after normalization with the empirical norm. The examples include logistic regression, density estimation and classification with hinge loss. Least squares regression is also discussed.",2008,Annals of Statistics
Observations on the behaviour and relationships of the White-backed Duck and the Stiff-tailed Ducks,"1. A number of behavioural and anatomical sources of evidence indicate that the White-backed Duck (Thalassornis) should be placed in the tribe Dendrocygnini and be regarded as a whistling duck rather than an aberrant Stiff-tailed Duck. 2. Behavioural evidence supports earlier views that the Black-headed Duck (Heteronetta) is the most generalized of the true stiff-tails, and it is suggested that the numerous unusual aspects of sexual behaviour found in this tribe can be traced back to a reduction of pair-forming and pair-maintaining mechanisms which can already be detected in Heteronetta. 3. The distinctive aspects of morphology and behaviour found in the Musk Duck (Biziura) can be attributed to the predictable effects of intense sexual selection resulting from the breakdown of pair bonds and the establishment of a completely polygamous or promiscuous breeding system in Biziura. 4. There is still too little behavioural information concerning the Masked Duck to advocate its generic separation (Nomonyx), although it is suggested that this species is probable the most isolated of the typical stiff-tails and presumably represents a less specialised evolutionary line than do the other stiff-tails of the genus Oxyura. 5. Recent behavioural evidence tends to support earlier views that the remaining five species of Oxyura fall into two broad evolutionary groups; including leucocephala and jamaicensis on the one hand, and maccoa, vittata and australis on the other.",1967,
Conditional Random Fields with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator to Classifying the Barley Genes Based on Expression Level Affected by the Fungal Infection.,"The classical methods for the classification problem include hypothesis test with the Benjamini-Hochberg method, hidden Markov chain model, and support vector machine. One major application of the classification problem is gene expression analysis, for example, detecting the host genes having interaction with pathogen. The classical methods can be applied and have a good performance when the number of genes having interaction with the pathogen is not sparse with respect to the candidate genes. However, conditional random field (CRF), with an appropriate design, can be applied and have good performance even when it is sparse. In this work, we proposed a modified CRF with a baseline to reduce the number of parameters in CRF. Moreover, we show an application of CRF with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to classifying barley genes of its reaction to the pathogen.",2020,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology

Such clinical and epidemic manifestation of human pseudotuberculosis is related to a certain bacterial clonal lineage characterized by a specific plasmid profile (pVM82, pYV48), sequence type (2ST) as well as the yadA gene allele (1st allele). In our study we examined features of inflammatory changes characterizing plasmidassociated pathogenicity of the FESLF pathogen. In addition, organ histopathology in experimental animals infected intraperitoneally with Y. pseudotuberculosis strains of the four plasmid types 48 + :82 + ; 48 + :82 - ; 48 - :82 + ; 48 - :82 - ; and 48 - :82 - was investigated. It was found that the mortality rate in animals infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis H-5015 strain (82 + :48 + ) bearing two plasmids with a molecular weight of 82 and 48 MDa was 40%. A picture of diffuse pneumonia with moderate inflammatory infiltration in pulmonary tissue and changes in lymphoid organs characterizing immunodeficiency we observed as early as 3 days postinfection (p.i.). On the contrary, animals infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis H-5015 strain (82+:48â€“) bearing a single plasmid 82 MDa pVM, mortality rate was 30%. A vascular reaction in the lungs and liver as well as deteriorated vascular destructive changes were revealed starting from day 3 and on day 5â€“7 days p.i., respectively, which was paralleled with perivascular infiltration mainly by mononuclear cells and focal pneumonia as well as a reaction of bronchialassociated lymphoid tissue and minimal organ destructive changes. On day 7 p.i., signs of granulomatous inflammation in the liver in a form of small mononuclear cell clusters and perivascular compact infiltrates were found. At all time points, lymphoid organ hyperplasia was noted. In case the infection caused by H-5013 strain (48+), the mortality rate was 80%. Inflammatory changes with dominant mononuclear cells were detected as early as 1 day p.i. associated with a picture of large focal bronchopneumonia, more pronounced in the non-survivor animals, also demonstrating signs of severe immunosuppression in the lymphoid organs. Starting from day 3 p.i., lymphoid hypoplasia in the spleen and lymph nodes was detected in all infected animals paralleled with pathogen-associated tissue damage in various organs. Animals infected with the plasmid-free H-5013 strain 48 - ) resulted in 25% mortality rate. Moreover, starting from day 3 p.i., a slight mononuclear inflammatory infiltration in the lungs and liver, a moderate giant cell reaction in the splenic pulp, and loose perinodal inflammatory infiltration in the lymph nodes were observed. Thus, while modeling infection caused by different plasmid types of Y. pseudotuberculosis, the data on differences in histopathology of changes in diverse organs regarding dynamics and generalization of the inflammatory response, as well as the severity of pathogen-associated damage in the lymphoid tissue were obtained. In case Y. pseudotuberculosis strains contained pVM82 plasmid with or without virulence plasmid pYV vs. single pYV-positive strains, an area of the inflammatory response as well as severity of immunosuppression manifested by splenic and lymph node delymphatization were decreased. It allowed to suggest that pVM82 plasmid found In Russia-originating Y. pseudotuberculosis strains might be implicated in limiting intensity of inflammatory response, bacterial dissemination and severity of lymphoid organ damage.",2019,Russian Journal of Infection and Immunity
FRM: a Financial Risk Meter based on penalizing tail events occurrence,"In this paper we propose a new measure for systemic risk: the Financial Risk Meter (FRM). This measure is based on the penalization parameter () of a linear quantile lasso regression. The FRM is calculated by taking the average of the penalization parameters over the 100 largest US publicly traded financial institutions. We demonstrate the suitability of this risk measure by comparing the proposed FRM to other measures for systemic risk, such as VIX, SRISK and Google Trends. We find that mutual Granger causality exists between the FRM and these measures, which indicates the validity of the FRM as a systemic risk measure. The implementation of this project is carried out using parallel computing, the codes are published on www.quantlet.de with keyword FRM. The R package RiskAnalytics is another tool with the purpose of integrating and facilitating the research, calculation and analysis methods around the FRM project. The visualization and the up-to-date FRM can be found on http://frm.wiwi.hu-berlin.de.",2017,
Vertical Distribution of carbon in Soils - Bayesian Analysis of carbon content and C14 profiles,"Global warming is a major issue for both the scientific world and societies. The concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 45% since the pre-industrial era (Harris, 2010) as a consequence of human activities, unbalancing the global carbon cycle. This results in global warming with dramatic impacts on the Earth, particularly for fragile populations.Amongst mitigation solutions, a better use of soil is proposed. Soils have the largest capacity of carbon exchanges with the atmosphere and contain a large stock of carbon. A tiny increase in this soil carbon stock and in carbon exchanges between atmosphere and soil would be more favorable to soil carbon sequestration and would compensate for carbon emissios from burning fossil fuel. However, soil carbon dynamics still suffers from insufficient knowledge. There remains therefore a huge uncertainty about the soil carbon response to climate and land-use changes.While several mechanistic models have been developed to better understand the dynamics of soil carbon, they provide an incomplete view of the physical processes affecting soil organic matter (OM). It will be long before a complete and updated soil dynamics model becomes available.In my thesis, I propose a Bayesian statistical model aiming at describing the vertical dynamics of soil carbon. This is done thanks to the modeling of both soil organic carbon and of radiocarbon data as they illustrate the residence time of organic matter and thus the soil carbon dynamics. The purpose of this statistical approach was to better represent the uncertainties on soil carbon dynamics and to quantify the effects of climatic and environmental factors on both surface and deep soil carbon.This meta-analysis was performed on a database of 344 profiles, collected from 87 soil science papers and the literature in archeology and paleoclimatology, under different climate conditions (temperature, precipitation, etc.) and environments (soil type and type of ecosystem).A hierarchical non-linear model with random effects was proposed to model the vertical dynamics of radiocarbon as a function of depth. Bayesian selection techniques, recently published, were applied to the latent layers of the model, which in turn are linked by a linear relationship to the climatic and environmental factors. The Bayesian Group Lasso with Spike and Slab Prior (BGL-SS), the Bayesian Sparse Group Selection (BSGS) and the Bayesian Effect Fusion model-based clustering (BEF) were tested to identify the significant categorical explanatory predictors (soil type, ecosystem type) and the Stochastic Search Variable Selection method to identify the influential numerical explanatory predictors. A comparison of these Bayesian techniques was made based on the Bayesian model selection criteria (the DIC (Deviance Information Criterion), the Posterior Predictive Check, etc.) to specify which model has the best predictive and adjustment power of the database profiles. In addition to selecting categorical predictors, the BSGS allows the formulation of an a posteriori inclusion probability for each level within the categorical predictors such as soil type and ecosystem type (9 soil types and 6 ecosystem types were considered in our study). Furthermore, the BEF made it possible to merge the types of soil as well as the types of ecosystem, which according to the BEF, are considered to have the same effects on the responses of interest here, such as the response of the topsoil radiocarbon.The application of these techniques allowed us to predict, on average and on a global level, the vertical dynamics of the radiocarbon in the case of a temperature increase of 1, 1.5 and 2 Â°C, and in the case of a change in vegetation cover. For example, we studied the impact of deforesting tropical forests and replacing them by cultivated land on soil carbon dynamics. The same statistical analysis was also done to better understand the vertical dynamics of soil carbon content.",2018,

Estimating cognitive workload while driving using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),"Introduction and Aim: We envision that driver assistive systems which adapt their functionality to the driverâ€™s cognitive state could be a promising approach to reduce road accidents due to human errors [1]. Workload is an important cognitive state because a cognitive overload or underload results in a decrease in human performance which may result in fatal incidents while driving. Here, we investigate if itâ€™s possible to predict variations of cognitive workload levels (WL) from fNIRS brain activation measurements while driving to inform adaptive assistive systems in future cars. Methods: In our study, we implemented the n-back working memory task with several continuously changing load levels as a speed regulation task into a realistic driving simulation in order to control and manipulate cognitive workload. We introduced five different workload levels (i.e. 0-back to 4-back) and speed signs every 20 seconds while the participant was driving on a highway with concurrent traffic. Depending on the current n-back task, the participant was supposed to remember the previous â€˜nâ€™ speed sequences and adjust his speed accordingly. A detailed explanation for the n-back experimental paradigm can be found in [2]. FNIRS data were recorded from the frontal and parietal cortices using a 32-channel neuroNIRX-system from five participants during the course of the whole experiment which lasted for around 30 minutes. Results: We used the multivariate linear regression approach by combining fNIRS data from all channels to predict WL using the elastic net regularization model which combines the L1 and L2 penalties of the lasso and ridge regression techniques to get a continuous estimate of workload over time. Fig.1 depicts a plot of WL induced by the n-back task (red curve) and the WL predicted by the model (blue curve) for an example participant. The correlation between the two curves is almost 0.8 for a 10-fold cross-validation. For the remaining four participants, we achieved a correlation between 0.6 and 0.8 which were all statistically significant (p < 0.05). 
Fig.1: Ten-fold cross-validated prediction of workload from deoxyhemoglobin fNIRS measurements using multivariate regression analysis in an example participant 
Discussion & Conclusion: It can be seen from Fig.1 that the predicted WL more or less follows the induced WL and could be used to predict if the WL is either increasing or decreasing. There are certain regions in the blue curve where the model seems to over- or underestimate WL which may be due to the incomplete model which currently neglects WL imposed by the concurrent driving task in the changing traffic situations. As a next step, we plan to introduce some non-linearity into the workload model to get much better prediction rates.

Improved Lasso for genomic selection.,"Empirical experience with genomic selection in dairy cattle suggests that the distribution of the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) might be far from normality for some traits. An alternative, avoiding the use of arbitrary prior information, is the Bayesian Lasso (BL). Regular BL uses a common variance parameter for residual and SNP effects (BL1Var). We propose here a BL with different residual and SNP effect variances (BL2Var), equivalent to the original Lasso formulation. The Î» parameter in Lasso is related to genetic variation in the population. We also suggest precomputing individual variances of SNP effects by BL2Var, to be later used in a linear mixed model (HetVar-GBLUP). Models were tested in a cross-validation design including 1756 Holstein and 678 MontbÃ©liarde French bulls, with 1216 and 451 bulls used as training data; 51 325 and 49 625 polymorphic SNP were used. Milk production traits were tested. Other methods tested included linear mixed models using variances inferred from pedigree estimates or integrated out from the data. Estimates of genetic variation in the population were close to pedigree estimates in BL2Var but not in BL1Var. BL1Var shrank breeding values too little because of the common variance. BL2Var was the most accurate method for prediction and accommodated well major genes, in particular for fat percentage. BL1Var was the least accurate. HetVar-GBLUP was almost as accurate as BL2Var and allows for simple computations and extensions.",2011,Genetics research
Preoperative assessment of lymph node metastasis in clinically node-negative rectal cancer patients based on a nomogram consisting of five clinical factors.,"Background
Currently, reliable approaches for accurate assessment of lymph node metastases (LNM), which is an important indication of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), are not available for clinically node-negative rectal cancer patients. This study aims to identify clinical factors associated with LNM and to establish a nomogram for LNM prediction in clinically node-negative rectal cancer patients.


Methods
The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) aggression and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify clinical factors associated with LNM. A nomogram was established to predict the probability of LNM in clinically node-negative rectal cancer patients based on the multivariate logistic regression model.


Results
Six potential risk factors were selected on the basis of LASSO aggression analysis, and five of them were identified as independent risk factors for LNM based on multivariate analysis, including MRI-reported tumor location, clinical T classification, MRI-reported tumor diameter, white blood cell count (WBC), and preoperative elevated tumor markers. A nomogram consisting of the five clinical factors was established and showed good discrimination. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the established nomogram was reliable and accurate for LNM prediction in clinically node-negative rectal cancer patients.


Conclusions
A nomogram based on five clinical factors, including MRI-reported tumor location, clinical T classification, MRI-reported tumor diameter, WBC, and preoperative elevated tumor markers, are useful for assessing LNM in clinically node-negative rectal cancer patients, which is important for preoperative CRT regimens.",2019,Annals of translational medicine
Group sparse regularization for deep neural networks,"In this paper, we address the challenging task of simultaneously optimizing (i) the weights of a neural network, (ii) the number of neurons for each hidden layer, and (iii) the subset of active input features (i.e., feature selection). While these problems are traditionally dealt with separately, we propose an efficient regularized formulation enabling their simultaneous parallel execution, using standard optimization routines. Specifically, we extend the group Lasso penalty, originally proposed in the linear regression literature, to impose group-level sparsity on the networks connections, where each group is defined as the set of outgoing weights from a unit. Depending on the specific case, the weights can be related to an input variable, to a hidden neuron, or to a bias unit, thus performing simultaneously all the aforementioned tasks in order to obtain a compact network. We carry out an extensive experimental evaluation, in comparison with classical weight decay and Lasso penalties, both on a toy dataset for handwritten digit recognition, and multiple realistic mid-scale classification benchmarks. Comparative results demonstrate the potential of our proposed sparse group Lasso penalty in producing extremely compact networks, with a significantly lower number of input features, with a classification accuracy which is equal or only slightly inferior to standard regularization terms.",2017,ArXiv
Catching Latrophilin With Lasso: A Universal Mechanism for Axonal Attraction and Synapse Formation,"Latrophilin-1 (LPHN1) was isolated as the main high-affinity receptor for Î±-latrotoxin from black widow spider venom, a powerful presynaptic secretagogue. As an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor, LPHN1 is cleaved into two fragments, which can behave independently on the cell surface, but re-associate upon binding the toxin. This triggers intracellular signaling that involves the GÎ±q/phospholipase C/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate cascade and an increase in cytosolic Ca2+, leading to vesicular exocytosis. Using affinity chromatography on LPHN1, we isolated its endogenous ligand, teneurin-2/Lasso. Both LPHN1 and Ten2/Lasso are expressed early in development and are enriched in neurons. LPHN1 primarily resides in axons, growth cones and presynaptic terminals, while Lasso largely localizes on dendrites. LPHN1 and Ten2/Lasso form a trans-synaptic receptor pair that has both structural and signaling functions. However, Lasso is proteolytically cleaved at multiple sites and its extracellular domain is partially released into the intercellular space, especially during neuronal development, suggesting that soluble Lasso has additional functions. We discovered that the soluble fragment of Lasso can diffuse away and bind to LPHN1 on axonal growth cones, triggering its redistribution on the cell surface and intracellular signaling which leads to local exocytosis. This causes axons to turn in the direction of spatio-temporal Lasso gradients, while LPHN1 knockout blocks this effect. These results suggest that the LPHN1-Ten2/Lasso pair can participate in long- and short-distance axonal guidance and synapse formation.",2019,Frontiers in Neuroscience
[Evaluation of application of national guidelines for the management of malaria in Bobo-Dioulasso university hospital].,"INTRODUCTION
To evaluate compliance with national guidelines concerning the diagnosis and treatment of malaria at Souro Sanou university hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso.


METHODS
This was a cross-sectional descriptive study based on the medical records of patients hospitalised in the Medicine and Paediatrics departments in 2012. All cases labelled as â€œmalariaâ€ on admission and on discharge, for which the medical records were complete, were included in the study.


RESULTS
Of the total of 1,722 cases collected, 1,674 cases (97.22%) were labelled as â€œsevere malariaâ€. The mean age of these patients was 2.65 years [95% CI: 2.41-2.90 years]; 87.63% of cases were under the age of 5 years. The sex-ratio was 1.22. The diagnosis complied with guidelines in 13.82% of cases. The rate of compliance with the diagnosis did not differ according to the severity of the disease (p=0.78), but differed according to age-group: 13.12% in subjects under the age of 5 years versus 18.78% in subjects over the age of 5 years (p=0.02). Cases labelled as â€œsevere malariaâ€ (SM comprised 1.47% of cases of â€œuncomplicated malariaâ€ (UCM); inversely, 4.17% cases of SM were identified among cases labelled as UCM. Overall, 242 cases (14.05%) were confirmed cases of malaria versus 1,480 cases (85.95%) of presumed malaria. Treatment complied with guidelines in 57.49% of cases. The adequate treatment rate was higher for cases of SM (58.90% versus 8.33%, p<0.01) and in children under the age of 5 years (58.71% versus 48.30%, p=0.02).


CONCLUSION
This study demonstrated poor compliance with clinical practice guidelines concerning the management of malaria in Bobo-Dioulasso university hospital. Identification of factors responsible for poor compliance with these guidelines may help to identify appropriate measures to improve compliance and contribute to control of malaria in the country.",2015,Sante publique
A Review of 'Big Data' Variable Selection Procedures For Use in Predictive Modeling,"A REVIEW OF â€˜BIG DATAâ€™ VARIABLE SELECTION PROCEDURES FOR USE IN PREDICTIVE MODELING By Sarah Papke August 2017 Thesis supervised by Dr. Frank Dâ€™Amico. Several problems arise when attempting to use traditional predictive modeling techniques on â€˜big data.â€™ For instance, multiple linear regression models cannot be used on datasets with hundreds of variables. However several techniques are becoming common tools for selective inference as the need for analyzing big data increases. Forward selection and penalized regression models (such as LASSO, Ridge Regression, and Elastic Net) are simple modifications of multiple linear regression that can provide some guidance on simplifying a model through variable selection. Dimension reducing techniques, such as Partial Least Squares and Principal Components Analysis, are more complex than regression but have the ability to handle highly correlated independent variables. Each of the aforeiv mentioned techniques are valuable in predictive modeling if used properly. This paper provides a mathematical introduction to these developments in selective inference. A sample dataset is used to demonstrate modeling and interpretation. Further, the applications to big data, as well as advantages and disadvantages of each procedure, are discussed.",2017,
Infrastructure as Institutional Relics: Insights from the United States Bridge System,"This thesis considers challenges with infrastructure management at the nexus of sociology and engineering. Why do we continue to struggle with the management of deteriorating infrastructure systems when capable engineering systems exist for monitoring, identifying, andprioritizing facets of these systems? The prevailing view of infrastructure systems assumes that they are exogenous to society and thus largely focus on the social impacts of the technical facets of such systems (infrastructure â†’ society). Utilizing institutional theory, science and technologystudies, and social movement theory, this thesis advances the perspective that social factors have an influence on the technical parameters of infrastructure systems; infrastructure is therefore endogenous to society (society â†’ infrastructure). The interplay between social and technicalfactors is explored through three complementary sections using a variety of statistical methods and 21 years of data from the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) of the United States Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and other sources.The first paper explores the institutional constraints that inhibit bridge managers from addressing challenges with remediation of outdated bridges. More specifically, it depicts bridges as institutional relics, whereby a bridgeâ€™s physical attributes reflect the accepted standards of thetime and later persist even when those standards may change. Bridges are more likely to be institutional relics when built prior to the adoption of national design mandates (regulative-based relics) or in locales whose engineering norms conflict with these national standards (normativebased relics). Bridge ownership and the spatial constraints present in more urban settings moderate the ability of bridge managers to address those bridges that are identified as relics. The second paper focuses on the role of attachment to institutional relics and its potential toinspire collective action around preserving them. Specifically, it considers movements to enroll bridges into the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on closure rates and subsequent sufficiency. Not only do bridges enrolled on the NRHP have a lower risk of closure in postenrollmentyears as compared to similar non-enrolled bridges, but these movements also restrict engineering options on enrolled bridges, with improvements focused on non-historic elements (i.e. the bridgeâ€™s substructure). This informs social movement research by considering movements of preservation instead of change and how movements can directly influence the built environment as an end goal.In the third paper, bridge sufficiency is considered through the lens of inspection data to identify influential attributes affecting monitoring of potential institutional relics. A framework is developed for providing feedback to bridge managers, designers, and policymakers. Givencomputation challenges, previous studies understandably and necessarily begin with a limited scope, data, or variable selection. This study leverages novel computational techniques, namely a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach, that can morecomprehensively consider the entire United States bridge system and its variables to inform attribute selection. It finds that a mixture of inspector-driven variables, design/maintenance variables, and weather are highly influential in calculating overall bridge sufficiency rating.Many of the factors that persistently influence bridge sufficiency are also related to social challenges, namely the presence of institutional relics, explored previously. As such, this paper presents one possible computational approach for scoping the most salient technical and socialvariables for which bridge designers and managers should focus attention when seeking to monitor bridge deterioration. These results are then tied to contemporary issues in bridge management and used to propose policy actions within each section of findings to better address bridge management issues. In sum, this thesis helps advance a more sociological understanding toward infrastructure, namely how social parameters can influence engineering systems, as applied in the context of bridgesystems.",2018,
Follow-Up after lasso-guided irrigated tip radiofrequency catheter ablation in paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation,"aims We evaluated clinical outcome of segmental/circumferential pulmonary vein (PV) isolation and linear defragmentation procedure in our first series of patients with paroxysmal 
or persistent atrial fibrillation (PAF/PEAF). The freedom from symptomatic AF/flutter/
tachycardia recurrences with patients off antiarrhythmic treatment (AAD) was primary 
endpoint of the procedure.
methods Consecutive patients with highly symptomatic PAF/PEAF and AAD failure were prospectively recruited from September 2003 to June 2007. Patients 40 % and left atrial diameter 3 months. In 
patients with PEAF, fast fragmented/complex electrograms were ablated in a linear fashion, 
connecting upper PV ostia and/or PV ostia with proximal anatomical structures. Only FI 
line was tested for completeness of block. The irrigated-tip radiofrequency ablation catheter 
and Lasso catheter (Biosense-Webster) were used after standard transseptal approach with 
X-ray fluoroscopy guidance. The suspected arrhythmia recurrences were evaluated by series 
of ECG/Holter recordings.
Results. Fifty-eight patients, 43 men, average age 50 years, range 19â€“69, including 24(41 %) with 
PEAF, were enrolled. In these patients, 113 procedures were performed: single study in 
20, 2 in 24, 3 in 11, and 4 in 3 patients, respectively. Complications occurred in 5 patients 
including tamponade in 2, acute effusion in 1, and inadvertened pericardial punction in 
2. No PV stenosis, esophageal injury, or stroke were detected clinically during 16-month 
(4â€“47) follow-up. We achieved primary endpoint in 42 patients (72 %); partial endpoint in 
5 patients (9 %) with significant reduction of AF/flutter/tachycardia recurrences on AAD; 
and in 11 patients (19 %) procedure was not successful. Overall, 81 % of our patients (93 
% with PAF, 63 % with PEAF) benefited from the procedure.
conclusions Lasso-guided irrigated-tip RF PV isolation and linear defragmentation is safe and long-term 
successful treatment of PAF/PEAF in majority of middle-aged patients.",2009,Slovenian Medical Journal

Geographically Weighted Regression Modeling with Fixed Gaussian Kernel Weighted on Spatial Data (Case Study of Food Security in Tanah Laut District of South Kalimantan),"Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is a regression model that takes into account the spatial heterogeneity effect. In regression models, often there is a relationship between two or more predictor variables is called multicollinearity. Geographically Weighted Lasso (GWL) is a method used to overcome spatial and spatial heterogeneity of local multicollinearity. The purpose of this study establishes the model by using the method of GWL in the case of spatial heterogeneity and overcome local multicollinearity on the issue of food insecurity in Tanah Laut district. Generally, food insecurity in Tanah Laut district is affected by the percentage of the population without access to electricity, the average number of store/grocery shop, and percentage of children under five and maternal mortality. GWL models obtained in accordance with the number of observation locations. The results validate the secondary data showed that the model obtained in the study are in accordance with the actual conditions in the field. Models with fixed weighting Gaussian Kernel is able to predict the eight villages with food security conditions are the same as the secondary data.",2014,
Modified path algorithm of fused Lasso signal approximator for consistent recovery of change points,"Abstract The path algorithm of the fused lasso signal approximator is known to fail in finding change points when monotonically increasing or decreasing blocks exist in the mean vector. In this paper, we first understand why the standard path algorithm by Hoefling (2010) fails in the primal optimization problem. We then propose a modified path algorithm for the consistent recovery of the change points and study its properties theoretically and numerically.",2019,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference
Solution of Linear Ill-posed Problems Using Overcomplete Dictionaries,"In this dissertation, we consider an application of overcomplete dictionaries to the solution of general ill-posed linear inverse problems. In the context of regression problems, there has been an enormous amount of effort to recover an unknown function using such dictionaries. While some research on the subject has been already carried out, there are still many gaps to address. In particular, one of the most popular methods, lasso, and its versions, is based on minimizing the empirical likelihood and unfortunately, requires stringent assumptions on the dictionary, the so-called, compatibility conditions. Though compatibility conditions are hard to satisfy, it is well known that this can be accomplished by using random dictionaries. In the first part of the dissertation, we show how one can apply random dictionaries to the solution of ill-posed linear inverse problems with Gaussian noise. We put a theoretical foundation under the suggested methodology and study its performance via simulations and real-data example. In the second part of the dissertation, we investigate application of lasso to the linear ill-posed problems with non-Gaussian noise. We have developed theoretical background for application of lasso to such problems and studied its performance via simulations.",2019,
"Etude De Lâ€™evolution Climatique Au Burkina Faso De 1983 a 2012 : Cas Des Villes De Bobo Dioulasso, Ouagadougou Et Dori","Climate zoning of Burkina Faso let out three regions obtained from the annual average temperature and annual rainfall variously registered in the territory. In view of the importance of the effect of the selected climatic parameters (pluviometry, temperature, relative humidity, duration of sunshine and wind velocity) on local life (daily activities), a careful analysis of their evolution is planning of long-term human behavior towards environmental resources: water, vegetation, animals, energy, soil. Â According to the results of the analysis of the 1983 to 2012 monthly averages of the selected parameters, we observe that, compared with the normal values 1981-2010, there is: in terms of temperatures, a strengthening of the rising trend of values in all three study regions (Bobo Dioulasso, Dori and Ouagadougou); in terms of precipitation, a drop in Bobo Dioulasso and an increase in Dori and Ouagadougou; a decrease in relative humidity and sunshine duration in the three study zones; in terms of the wind velocity, a constant evolution of the values in a general way.",2017,
"FÃ¶das, Ã¥ldras, lÃ¥na","Household debts is interesting for a number of institutions in society. One reason for this is that it gives a picture of how severely a potential economic crisis might affect the country. If a model can be found which precisely explains the household debt levels, it can be used to predict dangerous situations at an earlier stage, so that resources to counteract the situation can be employed before it turns into a large-scale meltdown. This thesis tries to find such a model, by examining whether there is a relation between debt level (measured as the quota between total debt and disposable income) and the natural variation in the number of births each year over a longer period of time. The thesis also examines whether the number of births, when used as explanatory variable, can outperform a model where interest rate is used as explanatory variable instead, with regard to explanatory power. The models used are estimated via application of time series analysis (AR(p)-models) and LASSO regression. The author finds signs indicating that there might be a connection between the number of births and debt levels, but nothing indicates that number of births is a better explanatory variable than for instance interest rate levels. It is also shown that the time series analysis gives the largest contribution in explaining debt levels, and a more rigorous analysis of time series is proposed for potential future studies on the topic.

The ambivalence of neighbourhood in urban Burkina Faso,"In the informal settlement of Sarfalao, in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso in south-western Burkina Faso, relations between newcomers and long-term residents in the neighbourhood were strained by the competition for living space and the opportunities to build a livelihood in the city. These tensions followed the involuntary return of large numbers of Burkinabe migrant workers from Cote d'Ivoire in the period 2000â€“2007 in particular, due to the civil war there. In this context, newcomers attempted to build relations and alliances with their neighbours while being treated with resentment by long-term residents who were overwhelmed by their mass arrival. The struggle for integration depended on the ability of each arriving family to assimilate local norms of respectability, making the neighbourhood the stage upon which the newcomersâ€™ morality was displayed and judged. While neighbourhood could potentially become the locus of kinship-like ties of relatedness and integration, it was experienced as a space of vital,...",2015,Anthropology Southern Africa
Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry,"Suicide is a major public health issue and a signiï¬cant cause ofdeath worldwide. Suicidal behavior includes a wide spectrum ofbehaviors, such as complete suicides, high-lethality suicide attemptsand low-lethality suicide attempts.Most suicide (about 90%) occurs in the context of psychiatricdisorders, most commonly mood disorders which are associated withapproximately 60% of all cases. Despite the high lifetime rate of suicide,most people with mood disorder never attempt suicide. Bipolar affectivedisorderhasalifetimerateofsuicid eof20%and15%ofpeoplewithmajordepressive disorder just commit suicide. This raises the question whysomepeoplewithmooddisorderareatriskofsuicideandothersarenot.In this regard, it is important to distinguish the biological correlates ofdiathesisforsuicidalbehaviorfromthebiologicalonesofthestressorsforthe suicidal behavior, such as depression.The causes of suicide are complex and no simple explanations of thephenomenon exist. In the stress â€“diathesis model of suicide, geneticfactors as well as acquired susceptibility, contribute to a person'sconstitutional predisposition or diathesis. Low serotonergic activity,early traumatic life experiences, and o ther factors, possibly cholesterol,mayplayapartinthedevelopmentofdiathesis.Thediathesisisre ï¬‚ectedin tendencies to experience more suicidal ideation and to be moreimpulsive and, therefore, more lik ely to act on suicidal feelings. Thediathesis for suicide is held to be the crucial determinant of whethersuicidal behavior is manifested under the in ï¬‚uences of the stress as aresult of, for example, acute psychiatric or physical illness, severe alcoholand drug abuse, and pressing social problems of family crisis. Thus,whether people take their own lives in such situations is explained withregard to variations in diathesis.Postmortem and clinical studies su ggest that serotonin dysfunction isa form of diathesis or trait style-risk factor, while HPA dysfunction isassociated with the stress response or state-dependency, and decreasedcholesterol and BDNF levels are related to brain dysfunctions amongindividuals with suicidal behaviors. Decreased serotonin functioningamongindividualswithsuicidalbehaviorhasbeenmeasuredwithCSF5-HIAA, fenï¬‚uramine challenge studies, and levels of platelet 5-HT2Areceptors. HPA axis dysfunction ha s been evaluated using the dexameth-asone suppression test. Cholesterol and BDNF levels can be measured inblood serum or plasma. Additionally, serotonin dysfunction and lowerBDNF activity among individuals with suicidal behaviors has been foundin the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Impairment in this region may beassociated with behavioral disinhibition and executive dysfunctions,which may be examined with some neurocognitive tests.The aim of this review is to convey to the readers recent knowledgefrom point of view of neuroimaging, neurobiology, animal model,molecular genetics and suicide prevention strategy. In this special issue,Audenaert et al. reviewed comprehensively the literature on structuraland functional neuroimaging studies of suicidal brain and emphasizedthat the development of suicidal behavior is related to volume reductionin several cortical and subcortical structure. Tsai et al. addressed recentmolecular genetic studies in suicidal behavior including case â€“controlassociation, genome gene-expre ssion microarray, and genome-wideassociation and concluded that the suicidal behavior involve multiplegenes interacting non-genetic factors. How feasible it is to model suicidalbehavior in an animal model? What animals should be considered tomodelsuicidalbehavior?ThesequestionsareconsideredinthereviewbyDr.Preti.Recentstudieshavedemonstratedthatanalterationinsynapticand structural plasticity is a key to mood disorder and suicide. Proteinkinase A (PKA) is a crucial enzyme in the adenylyl cyclase signaltransduction pathway and is involved in regulating gene transcription,cell survival and plasticity. Dwivedi and Pandey critically and compre-hensively discussed the role of PKA in suicidal behavior and suggestedthat PKA and related signaling molecules may serve as importantneurobiological factors in suicide. Can we predict the suicidal behaviorbiologically? Lee and Kim searched potential peripheral biologicalmarkers of the suicidal behavior of major depressive patients andproposed classiï¬cation of multiple factors to explain the risk of suicide.Can we prevent the suicidal behavior? Concerning this important issue,Dr. Nordentoft introduced ways of conceptualizing suicide preventionand the preventive model: Universal, Selective and Indicated prevention.I would thank all the contributors for ï¬nding the time to preparetheir manuscripts despite their busy schedule and I believe that thisreview can function as a step on the path toward the ultimate goal offully predicting, preventing, and treating suicidal patients.Yong-Ku KimDepartment of Psychiatry, College of Medicine,Korea University Ansan Hospital, 516 Gojan-Dong, Danwon-Gu,Ansan city, Kyunggi-Do, Republic of KoreaTel.: +82 31 412 5140; fax: +82 31 412 5144.E-mail address: yongku@korea.ac.kr.25 February 2011",2011,
Fast reconstruction of sparse relative impulse responses via second-order cone programming,"The paper addresses the estimation of the relative transfer function (RTF) using incomplete information. For example, an RTF estimate might be recognized as too inaccurate in a number of frequency bins. When these values are dropped, an incomplete RTF is obtained. The goal is then to reconstruct a complete RTF estimate, based on (1) the remaining values, and (2) the sparsity of the relative impulse response, which is the time-domain counterpart of the RTF. We propose two fast algorithms for the RTF reconstruction that solve a second-order cone program (SOCP), and show their advantages over the LASSO formulation previously proposed in the literature. Simulations with speech signals show that in terms of speed and accuracy, the proposed algorithms are comparable with the LASSO solution and considerably faster compared to the generic ECOS solver. The new algorithms are, moreover, easier to control through their parameters, which brings their improved stability when the number of reliable frequency bins is very low (less than 10%).",2017,2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)

However, affected by struggle for hegemony, the two powers clashed severely over lots of issues such as the shaping of world order, thalassocracy division, wartime strategy making, colony and sphere of influence control as well as commercial competition, etc. Nevertheless, because of the grand disparity in strength between the two countries, the change of international system, the impact of the war, and America's gradual and restrained way of rise, the UK gradually retreated.

"Creations: Medieval Rituals, the Arts, and the Concept of Creation (review)","her more general conclusions are well supported. The disadvantage is that readers must take care to weigh the evidence for themselves, so as not to place more faith in her bold speculations than they warrant. Valuable editions of music are included as supplements to three of Cardamoneâ€™s studies. They include the complete Colonia print of 1537 (I, pp. 97^130), the ten arie napolitane from the Roman print of c.1537 (VI, pp. 138^47), and five sample villanelle from the 1555 Dorico book (IX, pp. 18^27). The bass partbooks are missing from all of these collections. Cardamone reconstructs thebass for theColoniaprint, but includes it for the other collections only when it is found in other sources of the pieces. She provides expert editions of the texts separately from the music, includingEnglishtranslations andextensive footnotes explaining obscure words, proverbial expressions, double meanings, and relationships among different villanesca texts. Although the essays in the book range widely, they do not represent the full scope of Cardamoneâ€™s research on the villanesca. Discussions of the music are limited for the most part to typical features of the genre and a detailed investigation of musical and metrical forms. Studies of the styles of individual villanesca composers and four-voice arrangements of villanesche by Venetian composers are found in her 1972 dissertation, published as The canzone villanesca alla napolitana and Related Forms (Ann Arbor, 1981), and in the prefaces to her editions of villanesche: AdrianWillaert and His Circle, Canzone villanesche alla napolitana and villotte (Madison, Wis.,1978); Orlando di Lasso et al., Canzoni villanescheand villanelle (Madison,Wis.,1991); andGiovanthomaso Cimello,The Collected SecularWorks, edited jointly withJames Haar (Middleton,Wis., 2001). In an article that appeared too late to be included in this volume (Donna G. Cardamone and Cesare Corsi, â€˜The Canzone villanesca and Comic Culture: The Genesis and Evolution of a Mixed Genre [1537^57]â€™, Early Music History, 25 (2006), 59^104), she takes up once again the issue of the origins of the villanesca and sheds new light on it by focusing on the content and function, rather than the forms, of the songs. The publisher has included a general index (which unfortunately contains many errors of omission) and an index of first lines of villanesche to facilitate access to the material in the book.

Variable selection in Poisson HGLMs using h-likelihoood,"Selecting relevant variables for a statistical model is very important in regression analysis. Recently, variable selection methods using a penalized likelihood have been widely studied in various regression models. The main advantage of these methods is that they select important variables and estimate the regression coefficients of the covariates, simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a simple procedure based on a penalized h-likelihood (HL) for variable selection in Poisson hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLMs) for correlated count data. For this we consider three penalty functions (LASSO, SCAD and HL), and derive the corresponding variable-selection procedures. The proposed method is illustrated using a practical example.",2015,
Maskinell flateavdekking : historikk og potensial,"Pa det Norske Arkeologmote i Alesund 1993, presenterte jeg (Loken 1995) et kart over de stedene med maskinell flateavdekking som jeg hadde klart a fa kjennskap til. Det var et kart med 47 lokaliteter. Na, 10 ar senere, er det en halslos gjerning a prove a lage et tilsvarende kart hvor de fleste maskinelle flateavdekkinger kan komme med. Men hva er en maskinell flateavdekking, som skal vaere tema for dette seminaret? Maskiner kan benyttes for a fjerne tykke myrlag over avgrensete steinalderlokaliteter, eller tynne torvlag over omfattende ditto. Enkelte foredrag pa dette seminaret vil ta for seg slike forhold. Men nar en snakker om maskinell flateavdekking sa er det forst og fremst maskinell fjerning i stor skala av ployelag over boplasser hvor ployingen har odelagt kulturlag og konteksten for artefakter og annet materiale, som en har i tankene. Etter min oppfatning foretas maskinell flateavdekking i forbindelse med utgravning av boplasser. I det folgende vil maskinell flateavdekking med pafolgende utgravning av avdekkede strukturer karakteriseres som maskinell flategravning. Maskinelt oppgravde sokesjakter bor karakteriseres som maskinell sokesjakting, da sjaktingen har som formal a lokalisere og avgrense boplassomradene, og derfor bare avdekker en liten andel av disse (10-15 %) og ikke har som formal a gi et samlet bilde av den lokaliteten en star overfor. Mens maskinell flateavdekking ble utviklet som metode i Danmark fra begynnelsen av 1960-arene (Becker 1965), ble de forste maskinelle flateavdekkinger forst foretatt pa begynnelsen av 1970-arene i Norge (Rolfsen 1976), men da med bruk av hjullastere som redskap. Forst i 1982 ble den na eneradende (?) metodikk med gravemaskin pa et storre flateavdekket felt benyttet pa Forsandmoen (Loken et al. 1996). Utviklingen pa det gravningstekniske omradet har vaert enorm: Fra avrenset flate per dagsverk pa godt 50 m til i beste fall 400 m, fra all tegnet og skriftlig dokumentasjon pa tegneark og handskrevne protokoller og lister pa 1980-tallets anbefalte mate, (op. cit.) til at all oppmaling skjer elektronisk og alle protokoller og lister er databasebasert og elektronisk koplet til tegningenes strukturer, som eksempel AmSâ€™ Gauselundersokelse 1997-1999 (Borsheim & Soltvedt 2002:21) og Kvaleundersokelser 2001-2002 (Borsheim et al. 2001). Den maskinelle sokesjaktingen som metode innen kulturminnevernet har kommet som et resultat av at maskinell flateavdekking har vist at boplasser under ployelag er like utbredt i norske dal og breibygder som ellers i Skandinavia og Europa, og at 2-3 m brede sjakter lagt ut med 10-20 mâ€™s avstand gir hoy sannsynlighet for a pavise de boplasser som matte finnes. Bjorn Ringstad har vist at det er funnet bosetningsspor fra forhistorisk tid eller middelalder i 60-70 % av 120 maskinelle sokesjaktinger i More og Romsdal de siste 10-15 arene (Ringstad 2000:189). En lignede treffprosent synes a vaere tilfelle i Rogaland. Dessverre har vi ikke noen landsdekkende oversikt over verken mengden maskinelle sokesjaktinger eller andel med paviste legalfredete kulturspor, men ut fra de inntrykk en har fatt ogsa fra andre landsdeler, kan det etter min oppLoken, T. 2005: Mechanical topsoil stripping â€“ history and potential.

After giving a short historical survey of the methods development in Norway and especially the combination of archaeological and natural (pollen and macrofossil analysis) methods departing form the excavations at Forsand in Rogaland, it is argued that it is great need to improve the following four topics: 1. Due to the need for an immediate better general view of the results from the many excavations, it is argued in favour of a website with short information from each excavation. 2. It is necessary within short time to initiate research on the fast growing house and settlement material. 3. The new recognition that settlement sites with remains of houses are very numerous in all parts of the country must result in a new practise when dealing with cases of exemption from the Cultural Heritage Act. 4. In order to get the best possible knowledge from this type of excavation all such project must have natural research (at least pollen and macrofossil analysis) as an integrated part, both in planning and exercise.",2005,
Mechanism of Nanocarrier Release from the Abluminal Endothelium,"SUMMARY Passage through the endothelial barrier that lines the vasculature represents a major obstacle for effective drug delivery to certain tissues, e.g. the central nervous system. Targeting of drug carriers to endothelial receptors involved in vesicular transcytosis from the luminal (apical) to the abluminal (basolateral) side of said barriers is growing as a viable strategy to overcome this obstacle. However, the process by which a ligand-targeted carrier dissociates from its engaged receptor after transcytosis, to be released from the abluminal endothelial surface and penetrate a tissue, is rather unknown. In this study, we have examined this aspect using model polymer nanocarriers targeted to endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in a transwell model. Our results indicate that endothelial secretion of matrix metalloproteinases leads to receptor (ICAM-1) cleavage, thereby permitting release of the transcytosed carriers from the abluminal side of the endothelium. INTRODUCTION The endothelium represents a major biological barrier to the transport of therapeutic agents from the bloodstream into tissues requiring intervention (1). To overcome this obstacle, the field of drug delivery has focused on the design of nano-scale drug carriers that can target cell-surface receptors involved in vesicularmediated transcytosis across this barrier (2). For example, the transferrin receptor, insulin receptor, LDL receptor family, and aminopeptidase P are common targets used for ligand-mediated drug delivery across the endothelial lining. These molecules rely on classical pathways, i.e. clathrinor caveolae-mediated transcytosis, which have been shown to mobilize ligands below âˆ¼150 nm and âˆ¼70 nm, respectively. Alternatively, clathrinand caveolae-independent pathways seem to offer an opportunity to traverse endothelial linings. This is the case for carrier targeting to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). ICAM-1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein overexpressed on the endothelium during many pathological states, where it acts as a counter-receptor to integrins on leukocytes, contributing to their transmigration across the endothelium and into tissues (3). ICAM-1-targeting has recently been shown to provide transcytosis of ICAM-1targeted polymer nanocarriers across model endothelial barriers (4). This is regulated via CAM-mediated endocytosis, a clathrinand caveolae-independent pathway which provides transport of drug carriers within a wide range of sizes (e.g., 100 nm to 5 Î¼m) (5). However, despite this knowledge and technological advances, the means by which ligand-targeted carriers (which bind with significant avidity to their receptors) are released from their receptors after being transported to the abluminal endothelial surface vs. remaining bound to their receptors at this interface, is not understood. A possibility is that a ligand-targeted carrier disengages its receptor while in transit across the endothelial cell. This would be possible if the ligand-receptor complex travels through acidic or degradative compartments which may disrupt the ligand-receptor bond. However, transcytosis implies avoidance of intracellular lysosomal compartments, which are typically associated with such features. Therefore, it is likely other mechanisms may contribute to this, representing an important question for the field of drug delivery and basic biology on transcytosis. Proteolytic cleavage of ligand-receptor complexes following transcytosis (hence, extracellularly) could be a potential mechanism for carrier release from the abluminal endothelial surface. In particular, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent endopeptides secreted by endothelial cells and other cell types, are known to process a number of bioactive molecules, including the cleavage of cell-surface receptors, in order to regulate barrier function for leukocyte recruitment and transmigration across endothelial surfaces (6). The gelatinase subfamily of MMPs, consisting of MMP-9 and MMP-2, seem especially critical to this process. Furthermore, in the case of ICAM-1, literature indicates that there is significant interplay between this receptor and MMPs in the inflammatory response. Specifically, ICAM-1 engagement has been shown to stimulate MMP expression (7), and MMP-9 has been documented to cleave the extracellular domain of ICAM-1, leading to release of this receptor from the cell surface (8). As an example to illustrate the potential mechanism underlining effective release of transcytosed carriers from the abluminal endothelial surface, we have examined in this work the possibility of MMP-9 and MMP-2 being involved in ICAM-1 cleavage and effective transcytosis of ICAM-1-targeted nanocarriers. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Model polymer nanocarriers were prepared by surface adsorption of anti-ICAM onto 100 nm-diameter polystyrene latex beads (anti-ICAM NCs), yielding ~250 nm carriers. Non-degradable polystyrene models were used to avoid potential confounding effects of concomitant carrier degradation. This model has been extensively validated in the past (9). Human umbilical vein or human brain endothelial cells (HUVECs or HBMECs, respectively) were grown to confluence on 1.0 Î¼m-pore transwell inserts separating an apical chamber facing the luminal endothelial surface vs. a basolateral chamber facing the abluminal endothelial surface. Cells were incubated overnight with TNFÎ± to mimic a pathological state, where targeted carriers may be employed for drug therapy. Anti-ICAM NCs were then added to the upper chamber over the cells and incubated for 30 min at 37Â°C to permit carrier binding to the luminal cell surface, followed by removal of non-bound carriers and incubation in the absence of carriers for an additional 4.5 h, to allow for uptake of bound carriers and transcytosis. To measure the release of MMP-9, MMP-2, and the cleaved extracellular domain of ICAM-1, cell culture supernatants from the transwell apical and basolateral chambers were collected and analyzed by ELISA. For assessment of anti-ICAM NC transport through endothelial monolayers, anti-ICAM was labeled with a radioisotope ( 125 Iodine) and measured in the basolateral chamber (transcytosed fraction) vs. the transwell filter (cell fraction) using a gamma counter. The contribution of MMPs to ICAM-1 cleavage and carrier transcytosis was further tested using MMP inhibitors or addition of recombinant MMPs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION First, endothelial cells grown on transwell membranes secreted both MMP-9 and MMP-2 under inflammatory-like conditions. This correlated well with release of the extracellular domain of ICAM-1 from these cells, as reported, validating our model. Importantly, MMP-9 was mostly released to the apical chamber above the cells (92% of total release), while MMP-2 appeared similarly in both chambers. Next, we evaluated if release of these endothelial markers was also found in pathologically altered cells incubated with anti-ICAM NCs. This was the case: both MMP-9 and MMP-2 where released from cells, yet, their distribution was different from that of cells incubated in the absence of anti-ICAM NCs. Importantly, the presence of carriers rapidly shifted release of MMP-9 from the apical to the basolateral chamber (from 8% to 83% of total release by 30 min), and a similar, yet more slow, outcome was observed for MMP-2 (from 44% to 85% of total release by 5 h). In addition, cleaved ICAM-1 was released from the abluminal cell surface at a much greater level than the luminal surface (4-fold) by 5 h. In this model, 32% of anti-ICAM NCs were transported across the endothelial monolayer by 5 h. This agrees with our hypothesis that release of anti-ICAM NCs from the abluminal endothelial cell after transcytosis may be regulated by MMP-mediated ICAM-1 cleavage. Validating this, MMP-9 inhibitor caused a 1.5-fold reduction in the release of cleaved ICAM-1 from the abluminal endothelial surface. Also, inhibition of MMP-9 rendered greater retention of anti-ICAM NCs in the cellassociated fraction compared to the control (20% increase) and a 1.6-fold decrease in the number of antiICAM NCs transported from the luminal to abluminal cell surface. Similarly, we observed a slight reduction in the release of cleaved ICAM-1 from the abluminal surface in the presence of an MMP-2 inhibitor compared to the control (20% decrease), along with greater carrier retention in the cell fraction (27% increase), and a 2.4fold decrease in carrier release in the basolateral chamber compared to the control. Furthermore, reduction in carrier transport was even more pronounced by inhibiting both MMP-9 and MMP-2, with a ~31% increase in retention of carriers in the cell fraction and a concomitant 3-fold reduction in carrier release in the basolateral chamber. Finally, we investigated whether basolateral release of anti-ICAM NCs transported across endothelial cells could be enhanced by the addition of recombinant MMPs. Using MMP-9 as an example, addition of exogenous enzyme to endothelial cells resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in carrier detection in the basolateral chamber, concurrent with a 1.4-fold decrease in the number of carriers retained in the cell fraction. CONCLUSION Overall, our results indicate that endothelial secretion of MMP-9 and MMP-2 contributes to cleavage and release of the extracellular domain of ICAM-1, thereby permitting the release of ICAM-1-targeted NCs from the abluminal surface of endothelial cells after transcytosis across said monolayers. This is the first time that the mechanism of abluminal release of carriers transcytosed via ligand-receptor mediated interactions is elucidated. As such, this study provides critical insight into fundamental pathways underlining the biology of transcytosis and their potential translational applications, e.g. optimization of ligand (ICAM-1)-targeted drug carriers for enhanced delivery across endothelial barriers, critical for a significant num",2014,

Classification of low-grade and high-grade glioma using multi-modal image radiomics features,"Gliomas are primary brain tumors arising from glial cells. Gliomas can be classified into different histopathologic grades according to World Health Oraganization (WHO) grading system which represents malignancy. In this paper, we present a method to predict the grades of Gliomas using Radiomics imaging features. MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BRATs 2015) training data, its segmentation ground truth and the ground truth labels were used for this work. 45 radiomics features based on histogram, shape and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) were extracted from each FLAIR, T1, T1-Contrast, T2 image to quantify the property of Gliomas. Significant features among 180 features were selected through L1-norm regularization (LASSO). Based on LASSO coefficient and selected feature values, we computed a LASSO score and gliomas were classified into low-grade glimoa (LGG) or high-grade glimoa (HGG) through logistic regression. Classification result was validated by a 10-fold cross validation. Our method achieved accuracy of 0.8981, sensitivity of 0.8889, specificity of 0.9074, and area under the curve (AUC) = 0.8870.",2017,2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)
"Abstract. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a subgroup of RNAs able to regulate gene expression at the epigenetic level, and are therefore central to the regulation of numerous biological processes and the progression of multiple cancer","Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a subgroup of RNAs able to regulate gene expression at the epigenetic level, and are therefore central to the regulation of numerous biological processes and the progression of multiple cancer types. However, lncRNAs have not been identified to considerably influence overall survival (OS) outcome in numerous different types of cancer. The majority of studies investigating the association between lncRNAs and epigenetic regulation have focused on their altered expression levels in cancerous cells, and few studies have focused on determining the correlation between lncRNAs and OS time. In the present study, comprehensive lncRNA expression analysis was performed on a cohort of patients diagnosed with colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO). Subsequently, the construction of a prognostic methylation-based predictive system was performed based on the results of LASSO analysis. Functional enrichment analysis of lncRNA co-expression genes was also performed. According to the results of the present study, the classifier was able to significantly predict the prognosis of patients with COAD, and the investigation of the relevant elucidated genes further revealed the mechanism of COAD pathogenesis.",2020,
Three-Dimensional Electroanatomical Mapping to Guide Endocardial Occlusion of Stenotic Left Atrial,"Objective: Percutaneous endocardial occlusion of stenotic/incompletely ligated left atrial appendage (LAA) can pose unique access-related challenges. A novel approach for endocardial occlusion of stenotic/incompletely ligated LAA using three-dimensional (3-D) electroanatomical mapping (EAM) is described. Methods: The left atrial 3-D geometry was created using a circular mapping (LASSO) catheter and an EAM system. Although due to its severely stenotic neck the LAA itself could not be mapped, registration of the EAM to the left atrial computed tomography (CT) image allowed the integration of LAA anatomy. As such, this permitted endocardial LAA access under direct EAM visualization to guide LAA closure while obviating the need for fluoroscopy. Results: Four patients with atrial fibrillation, severely stenotic/ incompletely ligated LAA (neck measurements: 4.3 Â¡ 2.6 mm 6 2.8 Â¡ 0.5 mm) and intolerance to long-term anticoagulation underwent endocardial LAA occlusion using the proposed strategy. Complete LAA closure was successfully achieved in all patients (fluoroscopy time: 4.3 Â¡ 0.5 min; procedure time: 64 Â¡ 8 min). No acute/long-term adverse or embolic events occurred off anticoagulation during 14 Â¡ 2 months of follow-up. Conclusion: 3-D EAM can be employed to facilitate percutaneous endocardial occlusion of stenotic LAA, while minimizing fluoroscopy. The display of detailed anatomical data as provided by a pre-procedural CT proved invaluable in guiding this approach.",2014,

Learning Kullback-Leibler Divergence-Based Gaussian Model for Multivariate Time Series Classification,"The multivariate time series (MTS) classification is an important classification problem in which data has the temporal attribute. Because relationships between many variables of the MTS are complex and time-varying, existing methods perform not well in MTS classification with many attribute variables. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel model-based classification method, called Kullback-Leibler Divergence-based Gaussian Model Classification (KLD-GMC), which converts the original MTS data into two important parameters of the multivariate Gaussian model: the mean vector and the inverse covariance matrix. The inverse covariance is the most important parameter, which can obtain the information between the variables. So that the more variables, the more information could be obtained by the inverse covariance, KLD-GMC can deal with the relationship between variables well in the MTS. Then the sparse inverse covariance of each subsequence is solved by Graphical Lasso. Furthermore, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is used as the similarity measurement to implement the classification of unlabeled subsequences, because it can effectively measure the similarity between different distributions. Experimental results on classical MTS datasets demonstrate that our method can improve the performance of multivariate time series classification and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",2019,IEEE Access
De retour sur les lampes â€de Sagalassosâ€ et dâ€™autres lampes Â´Egyptiennes signÂ´ees du IIâ€™e si`ecle Ap. J.-C.,"In 1990, Adam Åukaszewicz published a lamp of a rare type, discovered in Alexandria and bearing the incised word CAFAA/ACCIK/QN on its base. In 1996, in the addenda dedicated to the clay lamps in his fourth volume of the corpus of the British Museum, Donald Bailey unveiled an identical artefact. Working on the lamp collection of Jean-Francois and Malou Bouvier, the present author found five lamps of the same typology but bearing on their base the inscriptions CAFAAA/THNA, HPQ/ON, IAIOY, and FOPT/TYNIC. Hepublishes them here and comes back to Åukaszewicz 's interpretation of the possible signification of these signatures and the probable origin of the artefacts themselves. The first hypothesis is to confirm Bailey's opinion seeing these lamps as pure Egyptian products, from Alexandria or the Nile Delta area. The second, considering the variety of the inscriptions, is either to regard these inscriptions as potters' marks that indicate a name (Ermon, Gaius) or ethnicon (Sagalassian, Gortynian) of expatriate potters, or to see two distinct categoriesamong them: the first with a potter's name (Gaius) and the second, as Åukaszewicz proposed, with a reference to holy ceremonies of the expatriates of Greek cities (Sagalassos, Gortys) and to their shrine (Heroon). Furthermore, the author connects these five with seven other signed lamps of the same period (2nd cent. AD), all from Egypt, in order to underline the migration phenomenon of well-known foreign lamp-makers such as Phoetaspus, who opened workshops in Egypt and launched there special products, inspired by some characteristicsof the standard Roman lamps but with a new, own identity. Finally, a rare witness of an opposed phenomenon is discussed - a lamp attesting to the willingness of a local lamp maker from the Fayyum area to adopt standard Alexandrine, Greco-Roman iconography",2012,
Predicting densities and elastic moduli of SiO2-based glasses by machine learning,"Chemical design of SiO2-based glasses with high elastic moduli and low weight is of great interest. However, it is difficult to find a universal expression to predict the elastic moduli according to the glass composition before synthesis since the elastic moduli are a complex function of interatomic bonds and their ordering at different length scales. Here we show that the densities and elastic moduli of SiO2-based glasses can be efficiently predicted by machine learning (ML) techniques across a complex compositional space with multiple (>10) types of additive oxides besides SiO2. Our machine learning approach relies on a training set generated by high-throughput molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, a set of elaborately constructed descriptors that bridges the empirical statistical modeling with the fundamental physics of interatomic bonding, and a statistical learning/predicting model developed by implementing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with a gradient boost machine (GBM-LASSO). The predictions of the ML model are comprehensively compared and validated with a large amount of both simulation and experimental data. By just training with a dataset only composed of binary and ternary glass samples, our model shows very promising capabilities to predict the density and elastic moduli for k-nary SiO2-based glasses beyond the training set. As an example of its potential applications, our GBM-LASSO model was used to perform a rapid and low-cost screening of many (~105) compositions of a multicomponent glass system to construct a compositional-property database that allows for a fruitful overview on the glass density and elastic properties.",2020,npj Computational Materials
Molecular Pathways Differentiate Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Recurrence from Acute Cellular Rejection in HCV Liver Recipients,"Acute cellular rejection (ACR) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence (HCVrec) are common complications after liver transplantation (LT) in HCV patients, who share common clinical and histological features, making a differential diagnosis difficult. Fifty-three liver allograft samples from unique HCV LT recipients were studied using microarrays, including a training set (n = 32) and a validation set (n = 19). Two no-HCV-ACR samples from LT recipients were also included. Probe set intensity values were obtained using the robust multiarray average method (RMA) method. Analysis of variance identified statistically differentially expressed genes (P â‰¤ 0.005). The limma package was used to fit the mixed-effects models using a restricted maximum likelihood procedure. The last absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model was fit with HCVrec versus ACR as the dependent variable predicted. N-fold cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased estimate of generalization error. A total of 179 probe sets were differentially expressed among groups, with 71 exclusive genes between HCVrec and HCV-ACR. No differences were found within ACR group (HCV-ACR vs. no-HCV-ACR). Supervised clustering analysis displayed two clearly independent groups, and no-HCV-ACR clustered within HCV-ACR. HCVrec-related genes were associated with a cytotoxic T-cell profile, and HCV-ACR-related genes were associated with the inflammatory response. The best-fitting LASSO model classifier accuracy, including 15 genes, has an accuracy of 100% in the training set. N-fold cross-validation accuracy was 78.1%, and sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 50.0%, 90.9%, 71.4% and 80.0%, respectively. Arginase type II (ARG2), ethylmalonic encephalopathy 1 (ETHE1), transmembrane protein 176A (TMEM176A) and TMEM176B genes were significantly confirmed in the validation set. A molecular signature capable of distinguishing HCVrec and ACR in HCV LT recipients was identified and validated.",2011,Molecular Medicine
Root Cause Diagnosis of Oscillation-Type Plant Faults Using Nonlinear Causality Analysis,"Abstract In industrial plants, productivity and product quality are often impacted by different types of faults. Specifically, oscillations commonly exist in many close-loop controlled processes. An oscillation generated in a single unit may propagate along process flows and feedback loops, affecting the performance of the entire plant. Therefore, it is critical to diagnose such oscillation-type plant faults and find out the root cause, so as to achieve fast recovery from abnormalities. In recent research, Granger causality (GC) test, which uses a statistical hypothesis test to judge whether a time series is useful in forecasting another, has been adopted to discover the root cause of plant-wide oscillations. However, the conventional GC is based on linear autoregressive (AR) models and cannot accurately handle the nonlinear causal relationship between time series. To solve this problem, a two-step diagnosis approach is proposed in this paper. In the first step, the faulty variables are isolated by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) based reconstruction analysis method. Then, the nonlinear GC test based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) is conducted on the isolated process variables to discover the path of fault propagation and find out the root cause of the fault.",2017,IFAC-PapersOnLine
A Large-Scale Linear Regression Sentiment Model,"This report details the findings in building a large-scale linear regression sentiment model for an Amazon book review corpus. We studied and applied a number of regression and NLP techniques, including Unigram/Bigrams, stop-word removal, ridge and lasso regression. 1. DATA CORPUS The corpus contains 975194 non-distinct book reviews collected from Amazon by Mark Dredze and others at Johns Hopkins. Along side the textual reviews we have numerically scored sentiment data on a scale of 1-5. The goal is to learn a linear regression based sentiment model from the textual reviews which can be applied to future reviews to obtain an estimate of the numerical sentiment score. 2. DATA PROCESSING The original data was represented in XML format. A simple tokenizer had been applied to obtain a flattened representation consisting of a reverse-indexed dictionary matrix, which allowed review-text and sentiment scores can be extracted. We obtained document boundaries by segmenting at token positions corresponding to the <review></review> pair. The textual body of a review is extracted by matching token positions for the <review text></review text> pair. Review titles often contain sentiment charged summaries of the review and hence are extracted and concatenated with the review body. Finally, numerical ratings are obtained by matching token positions bewtween the <rating> </rating> pair. 2.1 Duplicate removal It turns out that many of the reviews in the corpus were duplicates. to remove duplicates, we computed a textual-hash of the first 20 words (or the maximum number of words in the textual-review if less than 20 words) and discarded reviews for which the hash matched a prior review. At the end of this process we obtained 494761 distinct reviews, roughly half the size of the original corpus. 2.2 Featurization We experimented with both bag-of-words and bag-of-bigrams models. Each review is featurized into a multinominal count of words and bigrams. These counts are then normailized via tf-idf scores, computed as: St,d = tft,d Ã— log2 N",2012,
A gradient-based optimization algorithm for LASSO,"LASSO is a useful method for achieving both shrinkage and variable selection simultaneously. The main idea of LASSO is to use the L1 constraint in the regularization step which has been applied to various models such as wavelets, kernel machines, smoothing splines, and multiclass logistic models. We call such models with the L1 constraint generalized LASSO models. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called the gradient LASSO algorithm for generalized LASSO. The gradient LASSO algorithm is computationally more stable than QP based algorithms because it does not require matrix inversions, and thus it can be more easily applied to high dimensional data. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is fast enough for practical purposes and provides reliable results. To illustrate its computing power with high dimensional data, we analyze multiclass microarray data using the proposed algorithm.",2008,
Purification and characterization of a novel extracellular carboxylesterase from the moderately halophilic bacterium Thalassobacillus sp. strain DF-E4,"An extracellular carboxylesterase from the moderately halophile Thalassobacillus sp. strain DF-E4 was purified to 8-fold with 11% recovery and specific activity of 2,046Â U mgâˆ’1. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was approximately 49Â kDa as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, while SDS-PAGE analysis showed a single protein band corresponding to a molecular mass of 45Â kDa, suggesting that the enzyme was a monomer. Among the pNP (p-nitrophenyl) esters tested, p-nitrophenyl butyrate (C4) was hydrolyzed most effectively, with Km and Vmax values of 0.69Â mM and 0.84Â Î¼molÂ minâˆ’1Â mgâˆ’1, respectively, and the optimum activity occurred at pHÂ 8.5, 40Â°C and 0.5Â M NaCl (w/v). The enzyme activity appeared to be stable over pHÂ 6.0â€“9.5 and up to 45Â°C for 1Â h. Tests of substrate specificity and inhibitor susceptibility revealed it was a serine-type carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1), rather than a lipase. None of the divalent cations tested enhanced the enzyme activity, while most of them had no effect or slightly inhibited the activity. The enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by PMSF, PAO and DEPC, implying that serine, cysteine and histidine residues at the active site were essential for catalysis.",2010,Annals of Microbiology
Rare Feature Selection in High Dimensions,"It is common in modern prediction problems for many predictor variables to be counts of rarely occurring events. This leads to design matrices in which many columns are highly sparse. The challenge posed by such ""rare features"" has received little attention despite its prevalence in diverse areas, ranging from natural language processing (e.g., rare words) to biology (e.g., rare species). We show, both theoretically and empirically, that not explicitly accounting for the rareness of features can greatly reduce the effectiveness of an analysis. We next propose a framework for aggregating rare features into denser features in a flexible manner that creates better predictors of the response. Our strategy leverages side information in the form of a tree that encodes feature similarity. 
We apply our method to data from TripAdvisor, in which we predict the numerical rating of a hotel based on the text of the associated review. Our method achieves high accuracy by making effective use of rare words; by contrast, the lasso is unable to identify highly predictive words if they are too rare. A companion R package, called rare, implements our new estimator, using the alternating direction method of multipliers.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Block HSIC Lasso: model-free biomarker detection for ultra-high dimensional data,"Motivation Finding nonlinear relationships between biomolecules and a biological outcome is computationally expensive and statistically challenging. Existing methods have important drawbacks, including among others lack of parsimony, non-convexity, and computational overhead. Here we propose block HSIC Lasso, a nonlinear feature selector that does not present the previous drawbacks. Results We compare block HSIC Lasso to other state-of-the-art feature selection techniques in both synthetic and real data, including experiments over three common types of genomic data: gene-expression microarrays, single-cell RNA sequencing, and genome-wide association studies. In all cases, we observe that features selected by block HSIC Lasso retain more information about the underlying biology than those selected by other techniques. As a proof of concept, we applied block HSIC Lasso to a single-cell RNA sequencing experiment on mouse hippocampus. We discovered that many genes linked in the past to brain development and function are involved in the biological differences between the types of neurons. Availability Block HSIC Lasso is implemented in the Python 2/3 package pyHSICLasso, available on PyPI. Source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/riken-aip/pyHSICLasso).

Predicting Growth and Carcass Traits in Swine Using Metagenomic Data and Machine Learning Algorithms,"In this paper, we evaluated the power of metagenome measures taken at three time points over the growth test period (weaning, 15 and 22 weeks) to foretell growth and carcass traits in 1039 individuals of a line of crossbred pigs. We measured prediction accuracy as the correlation between actual and predicted phenotypes in a five-fold cross-validation setting. Phenotypic traits measured included live weight measures and carcass composition obtained during the trial as well as at slaughter. We employed a null model excluding microbiome information as a baseline to assess the increase in prediction accuracy stemming from the inclusion of operational taxonomic units (OTU) as predictors. We further contrasted performance of models from the Bayesian alphabet (Bayesian Lasso) as well machine learning approaches (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) and semi-parametric kernel models (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert space). In most cases, prediction accuracy increased significantly with the inclusion of microbiome data. Accuracy was more substantial with the inclusion of metagenomic information taken at week 15 and 22, with values ranging from approximately 0.30 for loin traits to more than 0.50 for back-fat. Conversely, microbiome composition at weaning resulted in most cases in marginal gains of prediction accuracy, suggesting that later measures might be more useful to include in predictive models. Model choice affected predictions marginally with no clear winner for any model/trait/time point. We, therefore, suggest average prediction across models as a robust strategy in fitting metagenomic information. In conclusion, microbiome composition can effectively be used as a predictor of growth and composition traits, particularly for fatness traits. The inclusion of OTU predictors could potentially be used to promote fast growth of individuals while limiting fat accumulation. Early microbiome measures might not be good predictors of growth and OTU information might be best collected at later life stages. Future research should focus on the inclusion of both microbiome as well as host genome information in predictions, as well as the interaction between the two. Furthermore, the influence of microbiome on feed efficiency as well as carcass and meat quality should be investigated.",2018,bioRxiv

Extraction of endocardial implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads.,"Despite a growing number of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead removal indications, there is no consensus about extraction techniques. We applied our experience of pacemaker lead removal to ICD leads using a superior approach with a standard extractor kit, and an inferior approach with a lasso, or a surgical extraction. Fifteen leads were removed in 11 patients during 12 procedures (1 patient was referred twice): 11 right ventricular defibrillation leads, 3 right atrial coils, and 1 atrial lead implanted with a DDD-ICD. The indication for lead extraction was insulation failure (n = 4), conductor fracture (n = 2), abdominal pocket infection (n = 4), lead endocarditis (n = 1), and replacement of an atrial coil by an atrial lead for DDD-R pacing (n = 1). One patient had surgical extraction of 2 leads because of an endocarditis with large vegetations on a DDD-ICD. In 11 other cases, 5 leads were removed using a superior approach with a standard extraction kit and 8 leads were removed by a femoral approach using a lasso alone or added to a pigtail catheter. There was no failure of explantation. One extraction attempt failed with the superior approach but was successful with a secondary inferior approach. The main difficulties encountered were due to tight adherence of the proximal coil to the venous wall and to dislodgment of passive fixation leads from their endocardial insertion. One patient had subclavian vein thrombosis after intervention; no major complication was noted. Ten patients immediately underwent reimplantation. Two patients (1 with an endocarditis and 1 free of ICD therapy for 5 years) did not have reimplantation. During a 4- to 44-month follow-up, no late complication appeared. Thus, ICD lead explantation can be performed with a good success rate, with extraction techniques similar to those used for pacemaker leads.",1999,The American journal of cardiology
Bridging Europe and Africa: Norman Sicily's Other Kingdom,"ENGLISH: The Norman conquest of Sicily detached the island from its North African framework, and a century of Latin Christian rule e""ectively transformed its society. But the island was not completely disconnected from the southern Mediterranean, as long term trade contacts, political links and military ambitions intervened to cast relations between the two sides. A Norman thalassocracy in the mid-12th century created a short-lived political bridge between Europe and Africa. In the age of the crusades, regional forces across the central Mediterranean could not be contained within the model of direct Christian rule experimented in the Latin east. !e present chapter studies the transition from informal control to the establishment of direct rule, which led to the formation of a 'Norman IfrÄ«qiya'. The short-lived Norman overlordship across IfrÄ«qiya was mainly recorded in the pages of medieval Muslim historians, conditioning the methodology used by its 
modern historians. !e study of Norman IfrÄ«qiya became possible thanks to a remarkable Muslim historiographic e""ort to explain Christian intervention in the a""airs of 
IfrÄ«qiya, underlining the historian's powerful role as arbiter.

New ISFET sensitive membranes,"Abstract In the scope of detection of heavy ions (Pb ++ , Cd ++ , Sn ++,++++ , Tl + , ...) in water we are looking for new versatile ISFET membranes. Chalcogenide and derived chalcohalide glasses are potentially interesting as membranes for selective electrodes or ISFET devices for the following reasons: low solubility in water, good ionic and very low electronic conductivities, wide range of composition permitting the preparation of various membranes. We present in this paper the study of a thin-film membrane for cadmium detection. The films have been prepared by r.f. magnetron sputtering from a target obtained by pressing under 1 T/cm 2 a powder mixture of composition 57As 2 S 3 38Ag 2 S 5CdS; the corresponding glass has already been used as a selective electrode (Y.G. Vlassov and E.A. Bychkov, Zh. Anal. Khim., 40 (8) (1986) 1438). The composition, structure and electrical properties of the films are studied. The C(V) response of Au/Si/SiO 2 /membrane structures to Cd ++ concentration and pH in various solutions has been studied. Reproducible results are obtained in a buffer solution (Tris, pH 9) in the range of Cd ++ concentration of 10 âˆ’5 to 10 âˆ’2 mol 1 âˆ’1 .",1990,Sensors and Actuators B-chemical
Component-wise AdaBoost Algorithms for High-dimensional Binary Classi fication and Class Probability Prediction,"Freund and Schapire (1997) introduced ""Discrete AdaBoost"" (DAB) which has been mysteriously effective for the high-dimensional binary classi cation or binary prediction. In an effort to understand the myth, Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani (FHT, 2000) show that DAB can be understood as statistical learning which builds an additive logistic regression model via Newton-like updating minimization of the exponential loss. From this statistical point of view, FHT proposed three modi fications of DAB, namely, Real AdaBoost (RAB), LogitBoost (LB), and Gentle AdaBoost (GAB). All of DAB, RAB, LB, GAB solve for the logistic regression via different algorithmic designs and different objective functions. The RAB algorithm uses class probability estimates to construct real-valued contributions of the weak learner, LB is an adaptive Newton algorithm by stagewise optimization of the Bernoulli likelihood, and GAB is an adaptive Newton algorithm via stagewise optimization of the exponential loss. The same authors of FHT published an influential textbook, The Elements of Statistical Learn- ing (ESL, 2001 and 2008). A companion book An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) by James et al. (2013) was published with applications in R. However, both ESL and ISL (e.g., sections 4.5 and 4.6) do not cover these four AdaBoost algorithms while FHT provided some simulation and empirical studies to compare these methods. Given numerous potential applications, we believe it would be useful to collect the R libraries of these AdaBoost algorithms, as well as more recently developed extensions to Ad- aBoost for probability prediction with examples and illustrations. Therefore, the goal of this chapter is to do just that, i.e., (i) to provide a user guide of these alternative AdaBoost algorithms with step-by-step tutorial of using R (in a way similar to ISL, e.g., Section 4.6), (ii) to compare AdaBoost with alternative machine learning classi fication tools such as the deep neural network (DNN), logistic regression with LASSO and SIM-RODEO, and (iii) to demonstrate the empirical applications in economics, such as prediction of business cycle turning points and directional prediction of stock price indexes. We revisit Ng (2014) who used DAB for prediction of the business cycle turning points by comparing the results from RAB, LB, GAB, DNN, logistic regression and SIM-RODEO.",2018,
"Palynology of the Albian Makhtesh Qatan site, northern Negev (Israel), with descriptions of two new pollen species","Abstract Three levels of an independently dated Early Cretaceous succession in the northern Negev have yielded palynofloras of Albian age. The Afropollis jardinus - Tricolpites - Trisectoris - Qatanipollis Assemblage is from the lowermost level, a shale bed of about 60Â cm thickness intercalated in the predominantly fluvial sandstones of the upper Hatira Formation at Makhtesh Qatan (IQ1 locality). The IQ1 palynoflora is dominated by psilatrilete spores, which are interpreted as influx from a fern bog. Altogether 46 formal and informal taxa were identified among the pteridophytic and bryophytic spores of this locality. The gymnosperms yielded 33 taxa including the new species Partitisporites krassilovii . The angiosperms are represented by 36 mono- and triaperturate species including Afropollis jardinus , the new species Foveomonocolpites ravnii and representatives of the genera Foveotricolpites , Qatanipollis , Rousea , Tricolpites and Trisectoris . A middle Albian age of this assemblage is supported by correlation of the IQ1 level with a marine intercalation, the Uza marine tongue of middle-late Albian age and by the stratigraphic position of the IQ1 bed below the ammonite-dated late Albian lower Hazera (Hevyon) Formation at Makhtesh Ramon. Immediately above the dark grey palyniferous IQ1 shale, grey or light grey shales occur, which are either barren or yielded the remains of a weathered, residual palynoflora with freshwater algae such as Botryococcus and Ovoidites . The upper Hatira Formation discussed so far is overlain by the marine carbonates of the Hazera (=Â Hevyon Formation). The lower part of this formation yielded at Makhtesh Ramon a late Albian ammonite ( Hypengonoceras , Lewy), which is associated with an elaterate pollen-bearing assemblage corresponding largely to the Afropollis jardinus â€“ Elaterosporites klaszii Assemblage recovered by the author from the same formation and locality. In contrast to the spore-dominated IQ1 Assemblage, the late Albian palynoflora from Makhtesh Ramon (Miz7/6) is dominated by Classopollis , followed by psilatrilete spores and dinoflagellate cysts. The IQ1 palynoflora reflects high humidity and influence from a vegetation rich in ferns, while the abundance of Classopollis (Cheirolepidiaceae) in the late Albian sample may suggest a shift towards drier conditions.",2017,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
Exploring High-Order Functional Interactions via Structurally-Weighted LASSO Models,"A major objective of brain science research is to model and quantify functional interaction patterns among neural networks, in the sense that meaningful interaction patterns reflect the working mechanisms of neural systems and represent their relationships with the external world. Most current research approaches in the neuroimaging field, however, focus on pair-wise functional/effective connectivity and are thus unable to handle high-order, network-scale functional interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel structurally-weighted LASSO (SW-LASSO) regression model to represent the functional interaction among multiple regions of interests (ROIs) based on resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. In particular, the structural connectivity constraints derived from diffusion tenor imaging (DTI) data are used to guide the selection of the weights, thus adaptively adjusting the penalty levels of different coefficients which correspond to different ROIs. The robustness and accuracy of our models are evaluated and demonstrated via a series of carefully designed experiments. In an application example, the generated regression graphs show different assortative mixing patterns between Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients and normal controls (NC). Our results indicate that the proposed model has promising potential to enable the construction of high-order functional networks and their applications in clinical datasets.",2013,Information processing in medical imaging : proceedings of the ... conference
Inference Without Compatibility.,"We consider hypothesis testing problems for a single covariate in the context of a linear model with Gaussian design when $p>n$. Under minimal sparsity conditions of their type and without any compatibility condition, we construct an asymptotically Gaussian estimator with variance equal to the oracle least-squares. The estimator is based on a weighted average of all models of a given sparsity level in the spirit of exponential weighting. We adapt this procedure to estimate the signal strength and provide a few applications. We support our results using numerical simulations based on algorithm which approximates the theoretical estimator and provide a comparison with the de-biased lasso.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Regina Maris and the Command of the Sea: The Sixteenth Century Origins of Modern Maritime Strategy,"ABSTRACT The concept of the command of the sea has its roots in medieval notions of the sovereignty of coastal waters, as claimed by several monarchs and polities of Europe. In the sixteenth century, a surge of intellectual creativity, especially in Elizabethan England, fused this notion with the Thucydidean term â€˜thalassocracyâ€™ â€“ the rule of the sea. In the light of the explorations of the oceans, this led to a new conceptualisation of naval warfare, developed in theory and then put into practice. This falsifies the mistaken but widespread assumption that there was no significant writing on naval strategy before the nineteenth century.",2017,Journal of Strategic Studies
LASSO-ing Potential Nuclear Receptor Agonists and Antagonists: A New Computational Method for Database Screening,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) are important biological macromolecular transcription factors that are implicated in multiple biological pathways and may interact with other xenobiotics that are endocrine disruptors present in the environment. Examples of important NRs include the androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptors (ER), and the pregnane X receptor (PXR). In this study we have utilized the Ligand Activity by Surface Similarity Order (LASSO) method, a ligand-based virtual screening strategy to derive structural (surface/shape) molecular features used to generate predictive models of biomolecular activity for AR, ER, and PXR. For PXR, twenty-five models were built using between 8 to 128 agonists and tested using 3000, 8000, and 24,000 drug-like decoys including PXR inactive compounds . Preliminary studies with AR and ER using LASSO suggested the utility of this approach with 2-fold enrichment factors at 20%. We found that models with 64â€“128 PXR actives provided enrichment factors of 10-fold (10% actives in the top 1% of compounds screened). The LASSO models for AR and ER have been deployed and are freely available online, and they represent a ligand-based prediction method for putative NR activity of compounds in this database.",2013,
Model selection with low complexity priors,"Regularization plays a pivotal role when facing the challenge of solving ill-posed inverse problems, where the number of observations is smaller than the ambient dimension of the object to be estimated. A line of recent work has studied regularization models with various types of low-dimensional structures. In such settings, the general approach is to solve a regularized optimization problem, which combines a data fidelity term and some regularization penalty that promotes the assumed low-dimensional/simple structure. This paper provides a general framework to capture this low-dimensional structure through what we coin partly smooth functions relative to a linear manifold. These are convex, non-negative, closed and finite-valued functions that will promote objects living on low-dimensional subspaces. This class of regularizers encompasses many popular examples such as the L1 norm, L1-L2 norm (group sparsity), as well as several others including the Linfty norm. We also show that the set of partly smooth functions relative to a linear manifold is closed under addition and pre-composition by a linear operator, which allows to cover mixed regularization, and the so-called analysis-type priors (e.g. total variation, fused Lasso, finite-valued polyhedral gauges). Our main result presents a unified sharp analysis of exact and robust recovery of the low-dimensional subspace model associated to the object to recover from partial measurements. This analysis is illustrated on a number of special and previously studied cases, and on an analysis of the performance of Linfty regularization in a compressed sensing scenario.",2013,Information and Inference: A Journal of the IMA
A Fast and Robust Paradigm for Fourier Compressed Sensing Based on Coded Sampling,"First-order gradient methods are commonly used for compressed sensing reconstruction. However, for Fourier sampling systems, they require computing a large number of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), which can be expensive in real-time applications. In this paper, instead of random sub-sampling, we use a sampling scheme inspired by coding theory from a recent sparse-FFT work of Pawar and Ramchandran [1]. In particular, we show that Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) applied on the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) with the coded sampling provides an O(log n) per-iteration speedup over the standard iteration cost, where n is the signal length. Since the coded sampling operation deviates from the common randomized compressed sensing sampling, it is a priori unclear whether LASSO can recover sparse signals. We provide recovery guarantees for LASSO using the coded sampling guaranteed for an arbitrary signal-to-noise ratio. For a k-sparse signal and under a uniformly random sparsity model, we show that LASSO recovers the underlying signal from O(k log4 n) measurements through the coded sensing system, with a reconstruction error that is proportional to the sparsity level and noise energy. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically computational speedups for using this scheme as well as lower MRI acquisition times.",2019,"ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
A Stepwise Approach for High-Dimensional Gaussian Graphical Models,"We present a stepwise approach to estimate high dimensional Gaussian graphical models. We exploit the relation between the partial correlation coefficients and the distribution of the prediction errors, and parametrize the model in terms of the Pearson correlation coefficients between the prediction errors of the nodes' best linear predictors. We propose a novel stepwise algorithm for detecting pairs of conditionally dependent variables. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods such as the graphical lasso and CLIME in simulation studies and real life applications. In our comparison we report different performance measures that look at different desirable features of the recovered graph and consider several model settings.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Travel-associated faecal colonisation with extended spectrum Î²-lactamase ( ESBL ) producing Enterobacteriaceae : incidence and risk factors,"Objectives: To study the acquisition of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) among the faecal flora during travel, with a focus on risk factors, antibiotic susceptibility and ESBL-encoding genes. Methods: An observational prospective multicenter cohort study of individuals attending vaccination clinics in Southeast Sweden was performed, in which the submission of faecal samples and questionnaires before and after travelling outside Scandinavia was requested. Faecal samples were screened for ESBL-PE by culturing on ChromID ESBL and an in-house method. ESBL-PE was confirmed by phenotypic and genotypic methods. Susceptibility testing was performed with Etest. Individuals who acquired ESBL-PE during travel (travelassociated (TA) carriers) were compared to non-carriers regarding risk factors, and unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) after manual stepwise elimination were calculated using logistic regression. Results: Of 262 enrolled individuals, 2.4% were colonised before travel. Among 226 evaluable participants, ESBL-PE was detected in the post-travel samples from 68 (30%) travellers. The most important risk factor in the final model was the geographic area visited: Indian subcontinent (OR: 24.8, p<0.001), Asia (OR: 8.63, p<0.001) and Africa north of the equator (OR: 4.94, p=0.002). Age and gastrointestinal symptoms also affected the risk significantly. Multi-resistance was seen in 77 (66%) of the ESBL-PE isolates, predominantly a combination of reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and aminoglycosides. The most common species and ESBL-encoding gene were E. coli (90%) and CTX-M (73%), respectively. Conclusion: Acquisition of multi-resistant ESBL-PE among the faecal flora during international travel is common. The geographic area visited has the highest impact on ESBL-",2013,
Adaptive Lasso for Cox's proportional hazards model,"We investigate the variable selection problem for Cox's proportional hazards model, and propose a unified model selection and estimation procedure with desired theoretical properties and computational convenience. The new method is based on a penalized log partial likelihood with the adaptively weighted L 1 penalty on regression coefficients, providing what we call the adaptive Lasso estimator. The method incorporates different penalties for different coefficients: unimportant variables receive larger penalties than important ones, so that important variables tend to be retained in the selection process, whereas unimportant variables are more likely to be dropped. Theoretical properties, such as consistency and rate of convergence of the estimator, are studied. We also show that, with proper choice of regularization parameters, the proposed estimator has the oracle properties. The convex optimization nature of the method leads to an efficient algorithm. Both simulated and real examples show that the method performs competitively. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.",2007,Biometrika

Has a quantitative approach, inductive because it goes from the particular to the general, deductive part from the general data accepted as valid to deduce by means of logical reasoning various assumptions, expository, investigative and analytical. The level or scope of the research was diagnostic-descriptive - explanatory and propositive, taking as a unit of information to the teacher and student, in addition was taken into account the technological didactic resources to know the technological infrastructure of the institution linked to the Teaching - learning processes that will strengthen teachers' pedagogy in the use of tics. The research methods were: observation, interview and survey. The data were categorized and interpreted to conclude that 61% of the teachers use the computer in the classroom and 84% of students would like to receive the natural and social environment classes through the computer, which justified the development of said Prototype multimedia tutorial. With this it was possible to reach the general goal that was proposed: to develop a tutorial with a multimedia approach to dynamize the natural and social environment in the students of the third year of basic education of the ""Plaza Lasso"" school in the city of Machala. Teachers are vital within the teaching process, as they have the mission of guiding students in the use of the computer as an implementation of tics. So the tutorial with a multimedia approach to the learning of the natural environment is necessary because it is possible to reach an effective and efficient quality teaching in which it gives the students broad knowledge about the subject. For the same was used the educational software cuadernia, since this is characterized by being a medium that supports the teaching-learning process, is also necessary for its functionality since it generates information dynamically through the creation of digital books in the form of notebooks Composed of multimedia contents and educational activities to learn playing in an easy interactive and very visual way taking into account that children of third year of basic education are at a level of basic reading and writing. This work aims to exercise a behavioral reference of learning as the basis of the pedagogical model given the prototype nature of the prototype and the use of information and communication technologies (tic) to support the design.

A new technique to predict fly-rock in bench blasting based on an ensemble of support vector regression and GLMNET,"Fly-rock caused by blasting is one of the dangerous side effects that need to be accurately predicted in open-pit mines. This study proposed a new technique to predict the distance of fly-rock based on an ensemble of support vector regression models (SVRs) and Lasso and elastic-net regularized generalized linear model (GLMNET), called SVRsâ€“GLMNET. It was developed based on a combination of six SVR models and a GLMNET model. Accordingly, the dataset including 210 experimental data was divided into three parts, i.e., training, validating, and testing. Of the whole dataset, 70% was used for the development of the six SVR models first as the sub-models. Subsequently, 20% of the entire dataset (the validating dataset) was used to predict fly-rock based on the six developed SVR models. The predicted results from the six developed SVR models were used as the input variables to establish the GLMNET model (i.e., SVRsâ€“GLMNET model). Finally, the remaining 10% of the dataset was used for testing the performance of the proposed SVRsâ€“GLMNET model. A comparison and evaluation of the six developed SVR models and the proposed SVRsâ€“GLMNET model were implemented based on five statistical criteria, such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), variance account for (VAF), and determination of correlation (R2). The results indicated that the proposed SVRsâ€“GLMNET model provided the most dominant performance in predicting the distance of fly-rock caused by bench blasting in this study with an RMSE of 3.737, R2 of 0.993, MAE of 3.214, MAPE of 0.018, and VAF of 99.207. Whereas, the other models yielded poorer accuracy with RMSE of 7.058â€“12.779, R2 of 0.920â€“0.972, MAE of 3.438â€“7.848, MAPE of 0.021â€“0.055, and VAF of 90.538â€“97.003.",2019,Engineering with Computers
State of Compact Architecture Search For Deep Neural Networks,"The design of compact deep neural networks is a crucial task to enable widespread adoption of deep neural networks in the real-world, particularly for edge and mobile scenarios. Due to the time-consuming and challenging nature of manually designing compact deep neural networks, there has been significant recent research interest into algorithms that automatically search for compact network architectures. A particularly interesting class of compact architecture search algorithms are those that are guided by baseline network architectures. Such algorithms have been shown to be significantly more computationally efficient than unguided methods. In this study, we explore the current state of compact architecture search for deep neural networks through both theoretical and empirical analysis of four different state-of-the-art compact architecture search algorithms: i) group lasso regularization, ii) variational dropout, iii) MorphNet, and iv) Generative Synthesis. We examine these methods in detail based on a number of different factors such as efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. Furthermore, empirical evaluations are conducted to compare the efficacy of these compact architecture search algorithms across three well-known benchmark datasets. While by no means an exhaustive exploration, we hope that this study helps provide insights into the interesting state of this relatively new area of research in terms of diversity and real, tangible gains already achieved in architecture design improvements. Furthermore, the hope is that this study would help in pushing the conversation forward towards a deeper theoretical and empirical understanding where the research community currently stands in the landscape of compact architecture search for deep neural networks, and the practical challenges and considerations in leveraging such approaches for operational usage.",2019,ArXiv
"An integrated lncRNA, microRNA and mRNA signature to improve prognosis prediction of colorectal cancer","Although the outcome of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) has improved significantly, prognosis evaluation still presents challenges due to the disease heterogeneity. Increasing evidences revealed the close correlation between aberrant expression of certain RNAs and the prognosis. We envisioned that combined multiple types of RNAs into a single classifier could improve postoperative risk classification and add prognostic value to the current stage system. Firstly, differentially expressed RNAs including mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs were identified by two different algorithms. Then survival and LASSO analysis was conducted to screen survival-related DERs and build a multi-RNA-based classifier for CRC patient stratification. The prognostic value of the classifier was self-validated in the TCGA CRC cohort and further validated in an external independent set. Finally, survival receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the performance of prognostic prediction. We found that the multi-RNA-based classifier consisted by 12 mRNAs, 1miRNA and 1 lncRNA, which could divide the patients into high and low risk groups with significantly different overall survival (training set: HR 2.54, 95%CI 1.67-3.87, p<0.0001; internal testing set: HR 2.54, 95%CI 1.67-3.87, p<0.0001; validation set: HR 5.02, 95% CI 2.2-11.6; p=0Â·0002). In addition, the classifier is not only independent of clinical features but also with a similar prognostic ability to the well-established TNM stage (AUC of ROC 0.83 versus 0.74, 95% CI = 0.608-0.824, P =0.0878). Furthermore, combination of the multi-RNA-based classifier with clinical features was a more powerful predictor of prognosis than either of the two parameters alone. In conclusion, the multi-RNA-based classifier may have important clinical implications in the selection of patients with CRC who are at high risk of mortality and add prognostic value to the current stage system.",2017,Oncotarget
Bioprocess data mining using regularized regression and random forests,"BackgroundIn bioprocess development, the needs of data analysis include (1) getting overview to existing data sets, (2) identifying primary control parameters, (3) determining a useful control direction, and (4) planning future experiments. In particular, the integration of multiple data sets causes that these needs cannot be properly addressed by regression models that assume linear input-output relationship or unimodality of the response function. Regularized regression and random forests, on the other hand, have several properties that may appear important in this context. They are capable, e.g., in handling small number of samples with respect to the number of variables, feature selection, and the visualization of response surfaces in order to present the prediction results in an illustrative way.ResultsIn this work, the applicability of regularized regression (Lasso) and random forests (RF) in bioprocess data mining was examined, and their performance was benchmarked against multiple linear regression. As an example, we used data from a culture media optimization study for microbial hydrogen production. All the three methods were capable in providing a significant model when the five variables of the culture media optimization were linearly included in modeling. However, multiple linear regression failed when also the multiplications and squares of the variables were included in modeling. In this case, the modeling was still successful with Lasso (correlation between the observed and predicted yield was 0.69) and RF (0.91).ConclusionWe found that both regularized regression and random forests were able to produce feasible models, and the latter was efficient in capturing the non-linearity in the data. In this kind of a data mining task of bioprocess data, both methods outperform multiple linear regression.",2013,BMC Systems Biology
Predictive Power of a Radiomic Signature Based on 18F-FDG PET/CT Images for EGFR Mutational Status in NSCLC,"Radiomics has become an area of interest for tumor characterization in 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) imaging. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate how imaging phenotypes was connected to somatic mutations through an integrated analysis of 115 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with somatic mutation testings and engineered computed PET/CT image analytics. A total of 38 radiomic features quantifying tumor morphological, grayscale statistic, and texture features were extracted from the segmented entire-tumor region of interest (ROI) of the primary PET/CT images. The ensembles for boosting machine learning scheme were employed for classification, and the least absolute shrink age and selection operator (LASSO) method was used to select the most predictive radiomic features for the classifiers. A radiomic signature based on both PET and CT radiomic features outperformed individual radiomic features, the PET or CT radiomic signature, and the conventional PET parameters including the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), SUVmean, SUVpeak, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), in discriminating between mutant-type of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and wild-type of EGFR- cases with an AUC of 0.805, an accuracy of 80.798%, a sensitivity of 0.826 and a specificity of 0.783. Consistently, a combined radiomic signature with clinical factors exhibited a further improved performance in EGFR mutation differentiation in NSCLC. In conclusion, tumor imaging phenotypes that are driven by somatic mutations may be predicted by radiomics based on PET/CT images.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Relationship between pulmonary vein antrum remodeling and recovered pulmonary vein conduction to left atrium after circumferential electrical isolation of pulmonary vein ostia,"Objective To explore the relationship between pulmonary vein antrum remodeling and recovered pulmonary vein conduction to left atrium after circumferential electrical isolation of pulmonary vein ostia.Methods A consecutive cohort of 359 cases undergoing re-procedures of catheter radiofrequency ablation because of atrial fibrillation recurrence from Jan 2007 to Sep 2009,including 180 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and 179 cases with persistent atrial fibrillation,were recruited.A decapolar circular mapping catheter(Lasso)was positioned in pulmonary vein to map recovered pulmonary vein conduction to left atrium.Under the guidance of electroanatomical mapping system(CARTO),the gaps were located and ablated.The left and right pulmonary vein antrun areas were measured by the software of the CARTO system.Results Catheter radiofrequency ablation was performed successfully on all the subjects.Recovered pulmonary vein conduction was demonstrated in 144 of 180(80%)cases with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,including 45 cases(31.25%)with single pulmonary vein re-conduction,58 cases(40.28%)with two,24 cases(16.67%)with three and 17 cases(11.81%)with four.Pulmonary vein re-conduction was observed in 155 of 179(86.59%)individuals with persistent atrial fibrillation,including single pulmonary vein re-conduction in 24 cases(15.48%),two in 72 cases(46.45%),three in 17 cases(10.97%)and four in 42 cases(27.1%).The area of left and right pulmonary vein antrum in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was 6.15Â±0.65 cm2 and 7.95Â±2.24 cm2,respectively.Whereas the area of left and right pulmonary vein antrum in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation was 10.48Â±1.0 cm2 and 11.4Â±2.16 cm2,respectively.Compared with that in persistent atrial fibrillation,the re-conduction rate of single pulmonary vein was higher(P=0.001),but the re-conduction rate of four pulmonary veins was lower(P=0.001)in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.The areas of both left and right pulmonary vein vestibules in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were smaller than those in persistent atrial fibrillation(P0.001 and P=0.022,respectively).Conclusion The pulmonary vein antrum in persistent atrial fibrillation is remodeled to greater degree than that in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,hence the proportion of recovered pulmonary vein conduction to left atrium after circumferential electrical isolation of pulmonary vein ostia in persistent atrial fibrillation is more than that in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.",2010,Chinese Journal of Interventional Cardiology
Dancing with the Wind: A Methodological Approach to Researching Womenâ€™s Spirituality around Menstruation and Birth,"Research into spirituality is by definition problematic. In an evidence-based culture, how is a concept like spirituality defined and measured? Through her doctoral dissertation, the author seeks to illuminate dimensions of female spirituality connected with the processes of menstruation and birth. In Western industrialized culture, these processes are regarded as medical concerns. Reframing the spiritual significance of menses, the author explores the links between attitudes toward menstruation and spirituality, and womenâ€™s birth experiences. The lack of research and literature about the spirituality of menstruation, or the spiritual care of the birthing woman denotes a vacuum in both theory and practice. The author presents her methodological approach to resolving the dilemma of how to research the elusive concept of female spiritualityâ€”an endeavor akin to attempting to lasso the wind! Through a combination of autoethnography, focus groups, and in-depth interviews, she takes up the challenge of expanding the qualitative research frontier.",2007,International Journal of Qualitative Methods - ARCHIVE
Fenestrated Aortic Arch Stent-Graft Malfunction With Endovascular Salvage,"Purpose To describe a case of a fenestrated aortic stent-graft device malfunction in the aortic arch, which left the stent-graft deployed and almost irretrievable had it not been for an escalating series of endovascular salvage maneuvers. Case Report A 47-year-old man presented with a rapidly enlarging 6.9-cm thoracic aneurysm that was a complication of a chronic type B aortic dissection. A 2-piece, custom-made, tapered, fenestrated thoracic endoprosthesis (innominate scallop plus single carotid) was planned to seal from the innominate origin to immediately above the celiac axis after staged left carotid to subclavian bypass. Blood pressure control with rapid ventricular pacing aided deployment of the proximal, fenestrated stent-graft component with both openings accurately positioned over their respective branch vessel ostia. Attempted retrieval of the nosecone was hampered by a release failure of the single conformance tie that connects the stent-graft to its central cannula. This left the stent-graft fully deployed with the nosecone irretrievable beyond a point immediately distal to the small fenestration. A series of endovascular salvage maneuvers ensued, ranging from simple actions to manipulate and balloon dilate the graft through to more complex attempts to break the tie and lasso the nosecone using snares. Finally, attempts at antegrade retrieval of the nosecone straightened the device and released the offending tie, allowing case completion. Conclusion This is a rare but cautionary example of the potential pitfalls of translating endograft technology from the abdominal aorta to the hostile environment of the aortic arch. It is likely that a combination of the arch curvature and hemodynamic forces, combined with the narrowed true lumen, contributed to failure of the trigger-wire tie release mechanism. Consideration of these endovascular salvage maneuvers may benefit interventional specialists who treat such diseases of the aortic arch.",2013,Journal of Endovascular Therapy
Variable Selection for Cox Proportional Hazards Models via Subtle Uprooting,"Cox proportional hazards model (Cox PH model) is heavily used in survival analysis to assess the importance of various covariates on the survival times of individuals or objects through the hazard function. This study suggests a new variables selection method for Cox PH models, under the title â€™Subtle uprootingâ€™, that does variable selection and model estimation for Cox proportional hazards (PH) models simultaneously. There are subset selection methods and shrinkage selection methods suggested in the context of Cox PH model. However the subset selection methods become infeasible in higher dimensions and the available shrinkage methods need tuning of parameters making the approach expensive and time consuming. Most attractive feature of the suggested method against available methods is that it does not require tuning of parameters anymore. Subtle uprooting uses hyperbolic tangent function as the penalty function based on its appropriate properties such as being a unit dent function, convenience of deriving derivatives and close relationship with the logit function. The procedure include three steps. First, it approximates the cardilaity using surrogate penalty function. Then uprooting and thresholding are used to enhance the shrinkage. In the simulation, subtle uprooting, best subset selection, SCAD, LASSO and adaptive LASSO methods are used for simulated data sets and comparisons are made between the methods based on the model error (ME), overfiting, underfitting and correct selection percentages. Furthermore performance of the methods are studied for different sample sizes, censoring rates and input signals (strong and weak). It is found that subtle uprooting outperforms SCAD, LASSO and adaptive LASSO methods under strong signals and higher sample sizes. Subtle uprooting, best subset selection, SCAD, LASSO and adaptive LASSO methods are applied to the PBC data set. It is found that subtle uprooting estimates are significantly closer to the best subset selection results.",2014,
Change in BMI Accurately Predicted by Social Exposure to Acquaintances,"Research has mostly focused on obesity and not on processes of BMI change more generally, although these may be key factors that lead to obesity. Studies have suggested that obesity is affected by social ties. However these studies used survey based data collection techniques that may be biased toward select only close friends and relatives. In this study, mobile phone sensing techniques were used to routinely capture social interaction data in an undergraduate dorm. By automating the capture of social interaction data, the limitations of self-reported social exposure data are avoided. This study attempts to understand and develop a model that best describes the change in BMI using social interaction data. We evaluated a cohort of 42 college students in a co-located university dorm, automatically captured via mobile phones and survey based health-related information. We determined the most predictive variables for change in BMI using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The selected variables, with gender, healthy diet category, and ability to manage stress, were used to build multiple linear regression models that estimate the effect of exposure and individual factors on change in BMI. We identified the best model using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and R(2). This study found a model that explains 68% (p<0.0001) of the variation in change in BMI. The model combined social interaction data, especially from acquaintances, and personal health-related information to explain change in BMI. This is the first study taking into account both interactions with different levels of social interaction and personal health-related information. Social interactions with acquaintances accounted for more than half the variation in change in BMI. This suggests the importance of not only individual health information but also the significance of social interactions with people we are exposed to, even people we may not consider as close friends.",2013,PLoS ONE
"Stable and Efficient Linear Scaling First-Principles Molecular Dynamics for 10,000+ atoms","The recent progress of linear-scaling or O(N) methods in the density functional theory (DFT) is remarkable. We expect that first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations based on DFT can now treat more realistic and complex systems using the O(N) technique. However, very few examples of O(N) FPMD simulations exist so far and the information for the accuracy or reliability of the simulations is very limited. In this paper, we show that efficient and robust O(N) FPMD simulations are now possible by the combination of the extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics method, which was recently proposed by Niklasson et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 123004 (2008)), and the density matrix method as an O(N) technique. Using our linear-scaling DFT code Conquest, we investigate the reliable calculation conditions for the accurate O(N) FPMD and demonstrate that we are now able to do actual and reliable self-consistent FPMD simulation of a very large system containing 32,768 atoms.",2014,arXiv: Materials Science
Structural Breaks in Time Series,"This chapter covers methodological issues related to estimation, testing and computation for models involving structural changes. Our aim is to review developments as they relate to econometric applications based on linear models. Substantial advances have been made to cover models at a level of generality that allow a host of interesting practical applications. These include models with general stationary regressors and errors that can exhibit temporal dependence and heteroskedasticity, models with trending variables and possible unit roots and cointegrated models, among others. Advances have been made pertaining to computational aspects of constructing estimates, their limit distributions, tests for structural changes, and methods to determine the number of changes present. A variety of topics are covered. The first part summarizes and updates developments described in an earlier review, Perron (2006), with the exposition following heavily that of Perron (2008). Additions are included for recent developments: testing for common breaks, models with endogenous regressors (emphasizing that simply using least-squares is preferable over instrumental variables methods), quantile regressions, methods based on Lasso, panel data models, testing for changes in forecast accuracy, factors models and methods of inference based on a continuous records asymptotic framework. Our focus is on the so-called off-line methods whereby one wants to retrospectively test for breaks in a given sample of data and form confidence intervals about the break dates. The aim is to provide the readers with an overview of methods that are of direct usefulness in practice as opposed to issues that are mostly of theoretical interest.",2018,arXiv: Econometrics

Survival associated pathway identification with group Lp penalized global AUC maximization,"It has been demonstrated that genes in a cell do not act independently. They interact with one another to complete certain biological processes or to implement certain molecular functions. How to incorporate biological pathways or functional groups into the model and identify survival associated gene pathways is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative gradient based method for survival analysis with group Lp penalized global AUC summary maximization. Unlike LASSO, Lp (p < 1) (with its special implementation entitled adaptive LASSO) is asymptotic unbiased and has oracle properties [1]. We first extend Lp for individual gene identification to group Lp penalty for pathway selection, and then develop a novel iterative gradient algorithm for penalized global AUC summary maximization (IGGAUCS). This method incorporates the genetic pathways into global AUC summary maximization and identifies survival associated pathways instead of individual genes. The tuning parameters are determined using 10-fold cross validation with training data only. The prediction performance is evaluated using test data. We apply the proposed method to survival outcome analysis with gene expression profile and identify multiple pathways simultaneously. Experimental results with simulation and gene expression data demonstrate that the proposed procedures can be used for identifying important biological pathways that are related to survival phenotype and for building a parsimonious model for predicting the survival times.",2010,Algorithms for Molecular Biology : AMB
Understanding the Role of Interior Sites and Terrestrial Resources during the Middle Holocene on Santa Cruz Island,"Author(s): Hoppa, Kristin Michele | Advisor(s): Glassow, Michael A; VanDerwarker, Amber M | Abstract: The Chumash, complex marine hunter-gathers of the Santa Barbara Channel region, have occupied both the northern Channel Islands and parts of the California mainland for around 13,000 years (Johnson et al. 2000). On the islands, where there are no terrestrial game animals, there is a dichotomy of marine faunal and terrestrial floral resources. Whereas fish, shellfish, and marine mammals are abundant in the waters surrounding the islands, terrestrial plants are less abundant and diverse than on the mainland. Nonetheless, dense shell middens throughout the northern Channel Islands attest to the fact that islanders regularly transported marine resources to interior and high elevation locations. The use of interior sites as residences (rather than logistical encampments) is most pronounced during the Middle Holocene (5500-1500 BC), after which there is a shift to permanent, coastal settlements (Kennett 2005). Scholars have hypothesized that this interior settlement pattern could be motivated by access to freshwater, toolstone, plants, travel routes, defensive locations, or locations used for community aggregation (Glassow 2014; Kennett 2005; Orr 1968; Perry and Delaney-Rivera 2011; Perry and Glassow 2015). There are several lines of indirect evidence suggesting that plant resources were important during the Middle Holocene, including the development of the mortar and pestle circa 3850-3050 BC (Glassow 1997a), higher frequencies of plant processing tools deposited as grave goods (Hollimon 1990, 2001), and higher rates of dental caries (associated with carbohydrate rich plant foods) in burial populations (Walker and Erlandson 1986). Recent macrobotanical studies on the northern Channel Islands (e.g., Gill 2015; Martin 2010; Martin and Popper 2001; Reddy and Erlandson 2012; Thakar 2014) provide direct evidence that many ethnographically important plant resources were locally available, and were used throughout prehistoric occupation; however, none of these studies explicitly address the role of terrestrial resources in Middle Holocene settlement patterns.The current study combines faunal and macrobotanical data from three interior Middle Holocene sites with starch granule residue analysis of groundstone artifacts from these and other interior Middle Holocene sites. The low densities of macrobotanical remains recovered do not support the long-held belief that interior sites were used to exploit terrestrial plant resources; indeed, the minimal seeds identified are largely from plants with ethnographic uses as medicine, rather than food. However, starch granules, including acorn (Quercus spp.), pine (Pinus muricata) and cherry (Prunus illicifolia), indicate that ethnographically important food resources were being processed at interior sites, but are not preserving in the macrobotanical record. Starch granules identified in this study provide the first direct evidence of what plants different types of groundstone were used to process on the northern Channel Islands. Moreover, this study demonstrates the value of integrating multiple lines of evidence to provide a more holistic understanding of prehistoric foodways, and sets baseline expectations for future paleoethnobotanical research in this region.",2017,
Hemoglobin polymorphism in the toadfish Thalassophryne maculosa Gunther,"Abstract A hemoglobin polymorphism characterized by three phenotypes is described in the toadfish, Thalassophryne maculosa Gunther. The genetic basis of the polymorphism seems to be rather simple: two alleles in one locus determine three phenotypes with different physiological properties; i.e. oxygen affinity of both blood and stripped hemolysates, root effect, and heme-heme interactions. Gene frequencies varied rather drastically in one of the four populations studied in eastern Venezuela. Although temperature variations may explain polymorphisms in some cases, it appears that environmental heterogeneity, in general, is a more feasible explanation.",1986,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology
Grouped variable selection in high dimensional partially linear additive Cox model,"In the analysis of survival outcome supplemented with both clinical information and high-dimensional gene expression data, traditional Cox proportional hazard model fails to meet some emerging needs in biological research. First, the number of covariates is generally much larger the sample size. Secondly, predicting an outcome with individual gene expressions is inadequate because a geneâ€™s expression is regulated by multiple biological processes and functional units. There is a need to understand the impact of changes at a higher level such as molecular function, cellular component, biological process, or pathway. The change at a higher level is usually measured with a set of gene expressions related to the biological process. That is, we need to model the outcome with gene sets as variable groups and the gene sets could be partially overlapped also. In this thesis work, we investigate the impact of a penalized Cox regression procedure on regularization, parameter estimation, variable group selection, and nonparametric modeling of nonlinear effects with a time-to-event outcome. We formulate the problem as a partially linear additive Cox model with high-dimensional data. We group genes into gene sets and approximate the nonparametric components by truncated series expansions with B-spline bases. After grouping and approximation, the problem of variable selection becomes that of selecting groups of coefficients in a gene set or in an approximation. We apply the group Lasso to obtain an initial solution path and reduce the dimension of",2019,
Blind Analysis of EGM Signals: Sparsity-Aware Formulation,"This technical note considers the problems of blind sparse learning and inference of electrogram (EGM) signals under atrial fibrillation (AF) conditions. First of all we introduce a mathematical model for the observed signals that takes into account the multiple foci typically appearing inside the heart during AF. Then we propose a reconstruction model based on a fixed dictionary and discuss several alternatives for choosing the dictionary. In order to obtain a sparse solution that takes into account the biological restrictions of the problem, a first alternative is using LASSO regularization followed by a post-processing stage that removes low amplitude coefficients violating the refractory period characteristic of cardiac cells. As an alternative we propose a novel regularization term, called cross products LASSO (CP-LASSO), that is able to incorporate the biological constraints directly into the optimization problem. Unfortunately, the resulting problem is non-convex, but we show how it can be solved efficiently in an approximated way making use of successive convex approximations (SCA). Finally, spectral analysis is performed on the clean activation sequence obtained from the sparse learning stage in order to estimate the number of latent foci and their frequencies. Simulations on synthetic and real data are provided to validate the proposed approach.",2012,arXiv: Machine Learning

Evaluating HER 2 amplification status and acquired drug resistance in breast cancer cells using Raman spectroscopy,"The overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is associated with increased breast cancer recurrence and worse prognosis. Effective treatments such as trastuzumab and lapatinib for patients with HER2 overexpression target the blockade of HER2 signaling activities but are often limited by the emergence of acquired drug resistance. This study applied Raman spectroscopy to differentially identify the amplification status of HER2 in cells and to characterize the biochemical composition of lapatinib resistant and sensitive HER2+ breast cancer cells in response to the drug. Raman spectra from BT474 (HER2+ breast cancer cell), MCF-10A (HER2âˆ’ control), and HER2+ MCF-10A (HER2+ control) were analyzed using lasso and elastic-net regularized generalized linear models (glmnet) for multivariate statistical analysis and were discriminated to groups of different HER2 expression status with an overall 99% sensitivity and specificity. Enhanced lipid content and decreased proteome were observed in HER2+ cells. With lapatinib treatment, lapatinib-resistant breast cancer cells demonstrated sustained lipogenesis compared with the sensitive cells. Â© The Authors.

Resampling-Based Variable Selection with Lasso for p >> n and Partially Linear Models,"The linear model of the regression function is a widely used and perhaps, in most cases, highly unrealistic simplifying assumption, when proposing consistent variable selection methods for large and highly-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we study what happens from theoretical point of view, when a variable selection method assumes a linear regression function and the underlying ground-truth model is composed of a linear and a non-linear term, that is at most partially linear. We demonstrate consistency of the Lasso method when the model is partially linear. However, we note that the algorithm tends to increase even more the number of selected false positives on partially linear models when given few training samples. That is usually because the values of small groups of samples happen to explain variation coming from the non-linear part of the response function and the noise, using a linear combination of wrong predictors. We demonstrate theoretically that false positives are likely to be selected by the Lasso method due to a small proportion of samples, which happen to explain some variation in the response variable. We show that this property implies that if we run the Lasso on several slightly smaller size data replications, sampled without replacement, and intersect the results, we are likely to reduce the number of false positives without losing already selected true positives. We propose a novel consistent variable selection algorithm based on this property and we show it can outperform other variable selection methods on synthetic datasets of linear and partially linear models and datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.",2015,2015 IEEE 14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)
Expanding Selection for Information Visualization Systems on Tablet Devices,"Selection is a fundamental operation in interactive visualization applications. Although techniques such as clicking and lassoing items of interest are sufficient for basic selections, a more sophisticated interaction mechanism is required for expressing complex queries to modify or generalize existing selections. The ability to perform these advanced selections is critical for effective analysis within visualization systems. On touch-based devices such as tablets, however, expressing advanced selections is difficult due to the absence of a cursor and modifier keys. In this work, we address this limitation by presenting new interaction techniques that leverage a person's non-dominant hand. We use these techniques for advanced selection operations such as expanding, modifying, and replicating existing selections. Further, we introduce a method for performing generalized selection on tablet devices that provides a fluid mechanism to control the attributes and parameters of selection.",2016,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces

Vizic: A Jupyter-based Interactive Visualization Tool for Astronomical Catalogs,"The ever-growing datasets in observational astronomy have challenged scientists in many aspects, including an efficient and interactive data exploration and visualization. Many tools have been developed to confront this challenge. However, they usually focus on displaying the actual images or focus on visualizing patterns within catalogs in a predefined way. In this paper we introduce Vizic, a Python visualization library that builds the connection between images and catalogs through an interactive map of the sky region. Vizic visualizes catalog data over a custom background canvas using the shape, size and orientation of each object in the catalog. The displayed objects in the map are highly interactive and customizable comparing to those in the images. These objects can be filtered by or colored by their property values, such as redshift and magnitude. They also can be sub-selected using a lasso-like tool for further analysis using standard Python functions from inside a Jupyter notebook. Furthermore, Vizic allows custom overlays to be appended dynamically on top of the sky map. We have initially implemented several overlays, namely, Voronoi, Delaunay, Minimum Spanning Tree and HEALPix layers, which are helpful for visualizing large-scale structure. All these overlays can be generated, added or removed dynamically with just one line of code. The catalog data is kept in a non-relational database, and the interfaces were developed in JavaScript and Python to work within Jupyter Notebook, which allows to create custom widgets, user generated scripts to analyze and plot the data selected/displayed in the interactive map. This unique design makes Vizic a very powerful and flexible interactive analysis tool. Vizic can be adopted in variety of exercises, for example, data inspection, clustering analysis, galaxy alignment studies, outlier identification or simply large-scale visualizations.",2017,arXiv: Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics
DIY Classroom Observations: A Toolkit for Novice Classroom Observers,"â€œImproving Student Experiences to Increase Student Engagementâ€ (ISE-2) was funded by the National Science Foundation, through EEC-Engineering Diversity Activities, at Texas A&M University. The grant activity focuses on a faculty development program for faculty who teach firstand second-year engineering courses. As part of the evaluation plan, classroom observations were conducted by the ISE-2 team to assess the classroom climate and teaching practices of ISE-2 faculty participants and non-participant faculty peers. Since Spring 2017, the team has conducted 78 classroom observations. The ISE-2 evaluation team had expert classroom observers train novice observers. The observer training sessions became the basis of this DIY Classroom Observation Toolkit, which is available for people who are interested in conducting systematic classroom observations but have limited experience with qualitative coding and observational research. The goal of the Toolkit is for these individuals to teach themselves using the Toolkit components: a) an annotated bibliography introducing articles that are helpful to understanding and conducting classroom observations, b) training videos teaching viewers to conduct classroom observations using a protocol, and c) a series of sample classroom videos and validation keys for each of the sample videos. This paper serves as a user manual for the Toolkit, which can be accessed at http://bit.ly/diyclassobtoolkit.",2019,
Circulating proteomic signature of early death in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction,"Heart failure (HF) remains a main cause of mortality worldwide. Risk stratification of patients with systolic chronic HF is critical to identify those who may benefit from advanced HF therapies. The aim of this study is to identify plasmatic proteins that could predict the early death (within 3 years) of HF patients with reduced ejection fraction hospitalized in CHRU de Lille. The subproteome targeted by an aptamer-based technology, the Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA) scan assay of 1310 proteins, was profiled in blood samples from 168 HF patients, and 203 proteins were significantly modulated between patients who died of cardiovascular death and patients who were alive after 3 years of HF evaluation (Wilcoxon test, FDR 5%). A molecular network was built using these 203 proteins, and the resulting network contained 2281 molecules assigned to 34 clusters annotated to biological pathways by Gene Ontology. This network model highlighted extracellular matrix organization as the main mechanism involved in early death in HF patients. In parallel, an adaptive Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was performed on these 203 proteins, and six proteins were selected as candidates to predict early death in HF patients: complement C3, cathepsin S and F107B were decreased and MAPK5, MMP1 and MMP7 increased in patients who died of cardiovascular causes compared with patients living 3 years after HF evaluation. This proteomic signature of 6 circulating plasma proteins allows the identification of systolic HF patients with a risk of early death.",2019,Scientific Reports
Linking fish habitat to their population dynamics,"We classify habitat features based on their effects on fish population dynamics and how fish populations affect the habitat's dynamics. We term habitat features that can be reduced in quantity or quality by fish usage as consumable resources. In general, consumable resources regulate fish populations in a density-dependent manner. In contrast, nonconsumable habitat features influence fish populations in a density-independent manner. We further classify habitat features by the influence that fish have on the supply of that resource. We designate habitat features whose supply is unaffected by fish usage (e.g., space) as being dynamically unaffected. Thus, the supply of these resources does not depend on the present or past abundance of fish. The supply of dynamically affected habitat resources (e.g., prey abundance) depends on current and past fish abundance. Using lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis ), we illustrate how changes in fish habitat can be integrated with changes in fish growth, survival, and reproduction through a stock-recruitment relationship. This example shows that single measures of population response such as carrying capacity or changes in surplus production do not fully represent the population-level changes following a habitat alteration.

Radiomics of 18F-FDG PET/CT images predicts clinical benefit of advanced NSCLC patients to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy,"Immunotherapy has improved outcomes for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet durable clinical benefit (DCB) is experienced in only a fraction of patients. Here, we test the hypothesis that radiomics features from baseline pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT scans can predict clinical outcomes of NSCLC patients treated with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. This study included 194 patients with histologically confirmed stage IIIB-IV NSCLC with pretreatment PET/CT images. Radiomics features were extracted from PET, CT, and PET+CT fusion images based on minimum Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence (KLD) criteria. The radiomics features from 99 retrospective patients were used to train a multiparametric radiomics signature (mpRS) to predict DCB using an improved least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, which was subsequently validated in both retrospective (Nâ€‰=â€‰47) and prospective test cohorts (Nâ€‰=â€‰48). Using these cohorts, the mpRS was also used to predict progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by training nomogram models using multivariable Cox regression analyses with additional clinical characteristics incorporated. The mpRS could predict patients who will receive DCB, with areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.86 (95%CI 0.79â€“0.94), 0.83 (95%CI 0.71â€“0.94), and 0.81 (95%CI 0.68â€“0.92) in the training, retrospective test, and prospective test cohorts, respectively. In the same three cohorts, respectively, nomogram models achieved C-indices of 0.74 (95%CI 0.68â€“0.80), 0.74 (95%CI 0.66â€“0.82), and 0.77 (95%CI 0.69â€“0.84) to predict PFS and C-indices of 0.83 (95%CI 0.77â€“0.88), 0.83 (95%CI 0.71â€“0.94), and 0.80 (95%CI 0.69â€“0.91) to predict OS. PET/CT-based signature can be used prior to initiation of immunotherapy to identify NSCLC patients most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. As such, these data may be leveraged to improve more precise and individualized decision support in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC.",2019,European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging
An Offer that you Can't Refuse? Agrimafias and Migrant Labor on Vineyards in Southern Italy,"In the 2011 post-Arab Spring migration wave, over 64,000 migrants landed on the southern Italian coast, with many of them potentially working illegally on farms through caporalato, a widespread system of illegal recruitment of underpaid farm labor run by Italian agrimafias. To test this hypothesis, this paper evaluates the causal effects of the 2011 migration wave on reported labor productivity focusing on vineyards in southern Italy. Based on a dynamic panel data model, labor productivity is estimated to increase by about 11% on average for 2011 and 2012. We show that this corresponds to a total of around 10 million unreported work hours, or 21,000 full-time employees, in each year. We interpret this as an increase in employment of illegal workforce due to the migration wave. Magnitude, direction, and statistical significance of the effect are confirmed under various model specifications and using synthetic control and post-lasso approaches.",2018,
Gaussian Graphical Models,"This chapter describes graphical models for multivariate continuous data based on the Gaussian (normal) distribution. We gently introduce the undirected models by examining the partial correlation structure of two sets of data, one relating to meat composition of pig carcasses and the other to body fat measurements. We then give a concise exposition of the model theory, covering topics such as maximum likelihood estimation using the IPS algorithm, hypothesis testing, and decomposability. We also explain the close relation between the models and linear regression models. We describe various approaches to model selection, including stepwise selection, the glasso algorithm and the SIN algorithm and apply these to the example datasets. We then turn to directed Gaussian graphical models that can be represented as DAGs. We explain a key concept, Markov equivalence, and describe how certain mixed graphs called pDAGS and essential graphs are used to represent equivalence classes of models. We describe various model selection algorithms for directed Gaussian models, including PC algorithm, the hill-climbing algorithm, and the max-min hill-climbing algorithm and apply them to the example datasets. Finally, we briefly describe Gaussian chain graph models and illustrate use of a model selection algorithm for these models.",2012,
