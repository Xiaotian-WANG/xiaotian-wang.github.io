â€œPractice makes perfect?â€ white matter microstructural characteristic predicts the degree of improvement in within-trial conflict processing across two weeks,"Several studies have investigated the trait-like characteristics of conflict processing at different levels. Our study extends these findings by reporting a practice-based improvement in within-trial conflict processing across two sessions. Eighty-three participants performed the same flanker task on two occasions 2Â weeks apart. A subset of 37 subjects also underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scanning the day before the first behavioral task. Despite the trait-like characteristics of conflict processing, within-trial conflict processing in the second behavioral session was significantly shorter than that in the first session, indicating a practice-based improvement in conflict processing. Furthermore, changes in within-trial conflict processing across the two sessions exhibited significant individual differences. Tract-based spatial statistics revealed that the improvement across two sessions was related to the axial diffusivity values in white matter regions, including the body and splenium of the corpus callosum, right superior and posterior corona radiate, and right superior longitudinal fasciculus. Subsequently, lasso regression with leave-one-out cross validation was used to assess the predictive ability of white matter microstructural characteristics in significant regions. The results showed that 61% of individual variability in the improvement in the within-trial conflict processing could be explained by variations in the axial diffusivity values in the four significant regions and the within-trial conflict processing in the first session. These results suggest that axonal morphology in the white tracts connecting conflict-related regions predicts the degree of within-trial conflict processing improvement across two sessions.",2018,Brain Imaging and Behavior
High-dimensional regression adjustments in randomized experiments.,"We study the problem of treatment effect estimation in randomized experiments with high-dimensional covariate information and show that essentially any risk-consistent regression adjustment can be used to obtain efficient estimates of the average treatment effect. Our results considerably extend the range of settings where high-dimensional regression adjustments are guaranteed to provide valid inference about the population average treatment effect. We then propose cross-estimation, a simple method for obtaining finite-sample-unbiased treatment effect estimates that leverages high-dimensional regression adjustments. Our method can be used when the regression model is estimated using the lasso, the elastic net, subset selection, etc. Finally, we extend our analysis to allow for adaptive specification search via cross-validation and flexible nonparametric regression adjustments with machine-learning methods such as random forests or neural networks.",2016,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Human Capital and Labor Informality in developing countries: A life-cycle approach (Job Market Paper)âˆ—,"Labor informality accounts for nearly 40% of the labor force in Latin America. While a more traditional view sees this phenomenon as a consequence of barriers to mobility resulting from poorly designed labor regulations, recent work provides evidence that individuals choose informal jobs based on their comparative advantage. In this paper, I develop a dynamic life-cycle model estimated with rich Chilean longitudinal data, in which individuals jointly decide on their schooling and labor participation, to investigate the extent to which comparative advantage drives participation in informal labor markets. Labor markets in Chile have been documented as being fairly competitive, and provide a unique setting to test for the comparative advantage approach to informality. This way, I explore three potential mechanisms: First, the importance that individuals assign to wages relative to their valuation of non-wage sector attributes; Second, whether individuals accumulate sector-speci c human capital with heterogeneous returns; and Third, the importance of the labor market expectations driving labor and schooling choices. Heterogeneous returns are included by modeling unobserved heterogeneity that determine both schooling and sector-speci c productivity. Model estimates suggest that comparative advantage is an important source of selection into informal jobs. I nd evidence that human capital di ers across sectors. In particular, High School returns are larger in the formal sector; there is a wage premium to College in the informal sector; and unlike informal experience, formal experience is positively rewarded in formal and informal jobs. In addition, more educated individuals assign more importance to non-wage sector attributes, particularly in the formal sector, while less educated individuals value higher wage returns, particularly in the informal sector. Using the model to study the e ects of recently implemented policies, I nd that a wage subsidy to formal youth employment would increase high school participation and would persistently reduce informality over the life-cycle, which serves to prove the importance of labor market expectations. Finally, I also nd some evidence of barriers to mobility to the formal sector. âˆ—I am deeply thankful to Costas Meghir and Orazio Attanasio, my thesis supervisors, for their valuable guidance and help.

A Novel Genetic Score Approach Using Instruments to Investigate Interactions between Pathways and Environment: Application to Air Pollution,"Air pollution has been associated with increased systemic inflammation markers. We developed a new pathway analysis approach to investigate whether gene variants within relevant pathways (oxidative stress, endothelial function, and metal processing) modified the association between particulate air pollution and fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Our study population consisted of 822 elderly participants of the Normative Aging Study (1999-2011). To investigate the role of biological mechanisms and to reduce the number of comparisons in the analysis, we created pathway-specific scores using gene variants related to each pathway. To select the most appropriate gene variants, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) to relate independent outcomes representative of each pathway (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine for oxidative stress, augmentation index for endothelial function, and patella lead for metal processing) to gene variants. A high genetic score corresponds to a higher allelic risk profile. We fit mixed-effects models to examine modification by the genetic score of the weekly air pollution association with the outcome. Among participants with higher genetic scores within the oxidative stress pathway, we observed significant associations between particle number and fibrinogen, while we did not find any association among participants with lower scores (p(interaction)â€Š=â€Š0.04). Compared to individuals with low genetic scores of metal processing gene variants, participants with higher scores had greater effects of particle number on fibrinogen (p(interaction)â€Š=â€Š0.12), CRP (p(interaction)â€Š=â€Š0.02), and ICAM-1 (pinteractionâ€Š=â€Š0.08). This two-stage penalization method is easy to implement and can be used for large-scale genetic applications.",2014,PLoS ONE
MRI-based texture analysis of the primary tumor for pre-treatment prediction of bone metastases in prostate cancer.,"PURPOSE
To identify texture features of multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) for pre-treatment prediction of bone metastases (BM) in patients with prostate cancer (PCa).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
One-hundred and seventy-six patients with clinicopathologically confirmed PCa were enrolledï¼Œand the data was gathered from January 2008 to January 2018. A total of 976 texture features were extracted from T2-weighted (T2-w) and dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (DCE T1-w) MRI. Step regression, ridge regression and LASSO regression method model was applied to select features and develop the predicting model for BM. The performance of the radiomics features, PSA level and Gleason Score were explored with the respect to the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Multivariable logistic regression analysis starting with the following clinical risk factors (PSA level, Gleason Score and age) and imaging biomarkers were applied to develop diagnostic model for BM in PCa.


RESULTS
The texture features, which consisted of 15 selected features, were significantly associated with BM (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.01). The combined MRI features derived from T2-w and DCE T1-w showed better prognostic performance (AUCâ€¯=â€¯0.898) than features derived from single sequence (T2WI AUCâ€¯=â€¯0.875, DCE T1-w AUCâ€¯=â€¯0.870) and Gleason Score (AUCâ€¯=â€¯0.731) for pre-treatment prediction of BM in PCa. MRI -based imaging biomarker combined with clinical risk factors (free PSA, age and Gleason score) yielded the highest AUC(AUCâ€¯=â€¯0.916). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the imaging biomarker was an independent risk factor for the detection of bone metastases along with f-PSA level (free PSA) and Gleason score.


CONCLUSION
Multiparametric MRI-based texture feature was significant predictor for BM in PCa. Clinical risk factors combined with MRI-based texture feature could further improve the prediction performance, which provide an illustrative example of precision medicine and may affect treatment strategies.",2019,Magnetic resonance imaging
BAMarrayâ„¢: Java software for Bayesian analysis of variance for microarray data,"BackgroundDNA microarrays open up a new horizon for studying the genetic determinants of disease. The high throughput nature of these arrays creates an enormous wealth of information, but also poses a challenge to data analysis. Inferential problems become even more pronounced as experimental designs used to collect data become more complex. An important example is multigroup data collected over different experimental groups, such as data collected from distinct stages of a disease process. We have developed a method specifically addressing these issues termed Bayesian ANOVA for microarrays (BAM). The BAM approach uses a special inferential regularization known as spike-and-slab shrinkage that provides an optimal balance between total false detections and total false non-detections. This translates into more reproducible differential calls. Spike and slab shrinkage is a form of regularization achieved by using information across all genes and groups simultaneously.ResultsBAMarrayâ„¢ is a graphically oriented Java-based software package that implements the BAM method for detecting differentially expressing genes in multigroup microarray experiments (up to 256 experimental groups can be analyzed). Drop-down menus allow the user to easily select between different models and to choose various run options. BAMarrayâ„¢ can also be operated in a fully automated mode with preselected run options. Tuning parameters have been preset at theoretically optimal values freeing the user from such specifications. BAMarrayâ„¢ provides estimates for gene differential effects and automatically estimates data adaptive, optimal cutoff values for classifying genes into biological patterns of differential activity across experimental groups. A graphical suite is a core feature of the product and includes diagnostic plots for assessing model assumptions and interactive plots that enable tracking of prespecified gene lists to study such things as biological pathway perturbations. The user can zoom in and lasso genes of interest that can then be saved for downstream analyses.ConclusionBAMarrayâ„¢ is user friendly platform independent software that effectively and efficiently implements the BAM methodology. Classifying patterns of differential activity is greatly facilitated by a data adaptive cutoff rule and a graphical suite. BAMarrayâ„¢ is licensed software freely available to academic institutions.

The incidence and clinical significance of non-isolation of the pulmonary vein carina after encircling ipsilateral pulmonary veins isolation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a pitfall of the double-Lasso technique.,"AIMS
Encircling ipsilateral pulmonary veins (PVs) isolation (EIPVsI) with the double-Lasso technique has proven to be effective to cure atrial fibrillation (AF). However, in this technique, PV mapping with circular catheters may miss a non-isolation of the PV carina. The purpose of this study was to reveal the incidence and clinical significance of a non-isolation of the PV carina after EIPVsI.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We studied 81 consecutive paroxysmal AF patients (age 61 Â± 12 years, 56 men), in whom EIPVsI was successfully performed in one encircling line with the endpoint of the demonstration of bidirectional conduction block between the PVs and left atrium (LA) with the double-Lasso technique. After a successful EIPVsI, pacing from the PV carina was performed and it captured the LA in 17 (21.0%) patients. During a mean follow-up period of 19 Â± 13 months, AF recurred in 13 (16.0%) patients. A multivariate Cox proportional analysis revealed that a non-isolation of the PV carina after the EIPVsI was a significant predictor (hazard ratio = 3.91, 95% confidence interval = 1.13-14.16, P = 0.03) of AF recurrence.


CONCLUSIONS
Pulmonary vein mapping with the double-Lasso technique did miss the non-isolation of the PV carina after a successful EIPVsI, which was an independent predictor of AF recurrence after the EIPVsI. Pacing from the PV carina may be required to confirm the electrical isolation of the PV carina after EIPVsI with the double-Lasso technique.",2013,"Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology"
Genomic Selection for Adjacent Genetic Markers of Yorkshire Pigs Using Regularized Regression Approaches,"This study considers a problem of genomic selection (GS) for adjacent genetic markers of Yorkshire pigs which are typically correlated. The GS has been widely used to efficiently estimate target variables such as molecular breeding values using markers across the entire genome. Recently, GS has been applied to animals as well as plants, especially to pigs. For efficient selection of variables with specific traits in pig breeding, it is required that any such variable selection retains some properties: i) it produces a simple model by identifying insignificant variables; ii) it improves the accuracy of the prediction of future data; and iii) it is feasible to handle high-dimensional data in which the number of variables is larger than the number of observations. In this paper, we applied several variable selection methods including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), fused LASSO and elastic net to data with 47K single nucleotide polymorphisms and litter size for 519 observed sows. Based on experiments, we observed that the fused LASSO outperforms other approaches.",2014,Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences
Explanation of somatic symptoms by mental health and personality traits: application of Bayesian regularized quantile regression in a large population study,"BackgroundSomatic syndrome is one of the remarkably prevalent issues in primary health care and subspecialty settings. We aimed to elucidate multidimensional associations between somatic symptoms with major mental problems and personality traits in the framework of the quantile regression model with a Bayesian approach.MethodsA total of 4763 employees at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services in Isfahan province, Iran, filled out four validated questionnaires including Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), NEO Questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and PHQ-15 for somatic symptom severity. In addition, Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGIDs) were determined using Rome IV criteria. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Bayesian regularized quantile regression with adaptive LASSO penalization were applied for reduced dimension of somatic symptoms and variable selection and parameter estimation, respectively.ResultsThe 25 major somatic symptoms were grouped into four factors including general, upper gastrointestinal, lower gastrointestinal and respiratory by EFA. Stress, depression, and anxiety had significant effects on all of the four extracted factors. The effect of anxiety in each four extracted factors was more than stress and depression. Neuroticism and agreeableness had significant effects on all of the four extracted factors, generally (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).ConclusionsGiven the high prevalence of somatic symptoms and psychosomatic complaints in correlation with the diverse range of mental co-morbidities, developing more detailed diagnostic tools and methods is crucial; nonetheless, it seems that providing better interdisciplinary approaches in general medical practice is groundwork.",2019,BMC Psychiatry
Evaluation of inflammatory response induced by different types of daily contact lenses,"Introduction: Contact lenses (CL) are biocompatible materials however, CL can also act as a vector for microorganisms to adhere and transfer to the ocular surface. Communal microorganisms that uneventfully cohabitate on lid margins and conjunctiva and potential pathogens that are found transiently on the ocular surface can adhere to CL in vivo. In the presence of reduced tissue resistance, these resident microorganisms or transient pathogens can invade and colonize the cornea or conjunctiva and produce inflammation or infection. Approximately two thirds of the isolated bacteria from CLassociated microbial keratitis are Gram-negative bacterial strains, most notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa but also some Serratia species, while one third comprises Gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidi. Purpose: In order to access the inflammatory potential of daily disposable CL, the propose of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory response induced by different types of daily CL before and also after a normal daily wear. The inflammatory response can be measured by quantifying the Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-Î±) produced by macrophages after contact with the CL. The microorganisms that are able to adhere to the CL are the major inducer of a possible inflammatory response, so microbiome of CL after the normal daily wear will also be evaluated. Methods: To establish the best incubation time to evaluate the pro-inflammatory potential of the daily weared CL (8 hours of wear), they were co-incubated with a macrophage cell culture for 3h, 8h and 14h and TNF-Î± in the supernatant of coincubation was quantified by ELISA. Macrophage cell viability after co-incubation with CL was also accessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage assay. Results: The results showed that after 3h of co-incubation, only the positive control (containing LPS) showed a significant increase in TNF-Î± values. After 8h, of coincubation the weared CL showed a significant increase of four times, while at 14h that increase was only of 2.5 times. Analysis of the LDH showed that at 14h of coincubation more than 50% of the macrophage cells were death, contrary to 3 and 8 hour of co-incubation that showed viability values above 85%. Conclusion: These results indicated that the best incubation time to test the inflammatory potential of the CL wear 8 hours of co-incubation.",2016,
Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction Using Differential Evolution,"In this paper we proposed a method to improve the accuracy of prediction of genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP). In GBLUP a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) is used to define the variance-covariance relationship between individuals and is calculated from all available genotyped markers. Instead of using all markers to build the GRM, which is then used for trait prediction, we used an evolutionary algorithm (differential evolution â€“ DE) to subset the marker set and identify the markers that best capture the variance-covariance structure between individuals for specific traits. This subset of markers was then used to build a trait relationship matrix (TRM) that replaces the GRM in GBLUP (herein referred to as TBLUP). The predictive ability of TBLUP was compared against GBLUP and a Bayesian method (Bayesian LASSO) using simulated and real data. We found that TBLUP has better predictive ability than GBLUP and Bayesian LASSO in almost all scenarios.",2015,
ATP-induced dormant pulmonary veins originating from the carina region after circumferential pulmonary vein isolation of atrial fibrillation.,"INTRODUCTION
Elimination of transient pulmonary vein recurrences (dormant PVs) induced by an ATP injection and ablation at the PV carina region is an effective strategy for atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. The relationship between dormant PVs and the PV carina region has not been evaluated.


METHODS
A total of 212 consecutive symptomatic AF patients underwent circumferential PV electrical isolation (CPVEI) with a double lasso technique. They were divided into 2 groups in a retrospective review; Group 1: those given an ATP injection during an intravenous isoproterenol infusion after the CPVEI (n = 106), and Group 2: those in which it was not given after the CPVEI (n = 106). Radiofrequency energy was applied at the earliest dormant PV activation site identified using a Lasso catheter on the CPVEI line and then PV carina region if it was ineffective.


RESULTS
After a successful PVEI, 54 patients (51%) in Group 1 had PV reconnections during an ATP injection. Acute PVEI sites were observed on the carina region within the CPVEI line in the right PVs (16%) and left PVs (10%). Dormant PVs were reisolated at the carina region in the right PVs (23%) and left PVs (26%). The distribution of the dormant PV sites, except for the RIPV, significantly differed from that of the acute PVEI sites (P < 0.05). Further, AF recurred significantly in the Group 2 patients as compared to those in Group 1 during 16 +/- 6.1 months of follow-up (P < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
PV carina region origins may partly be responsible for an acute PVEI and potential recurrences.",2010,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology
Bornes de risque amÃ©liorÃ©es pour le Lasso,"Although the Lasso has been extensively studied, the relationship between its prediction performance and the correlations of the covariates is not fully understood. In this document, we give new insights into this relationship in the context of multiple linear regression. We show, in particular, that the incorporation of a simple correlation measure into the tuning parameter leads to a nearly optimal prediction performance of the Lasso even for highly correlated covariates. However, we also reveal that for moderately correlated covariates, the prediction performance of the Lasso can be mediocre irrespective of the choice of the tuning parameter.",2014,
"DistribuciÃ³n, alimentaciÃ³n y reproducciÃ³n de tres especies de pavones Cichla spp. (Perciformes, Cichlidae) en la cuenca baja del rÃ­o Ventuari, Estado Amazonas, Venezuela","We studied aspects related to the distribution, diet and reproduction of three species of peacock bass (Cichla spp.) in the lower Ventuari River, Orinoco Basin, Amazonas State, Venezuela. The study included estimation of population structure according to size and weight frequencies. Two habitat were considered: main channel and creeks with connected lagoons. Three sympatric species were studied, C. temensis, C. orinocensis and C. intermedia. The first two were abundant and distributed in the majority of habitat examined (lagoons, main channel, and sand banks), but C. intermedia was restricted to habitat with high current in the main channel. Cichla temensis was the largest species in standard length and weight ( = 400 mm Â± 96, = 1535 g Â± 1240 g), followed by C. orinocensis ( = 301 mm Â± 56 and = 654 g Â± 390) and C. intermedia ( = 332 mm Â± 59; = 833 g Â± 420). We found nests of Cichla in rocks and sand banks during December, February and March, and adults with fry in the inundated floodplain at the end of May and in June. Although Cichla from the lower Ventuari River probably reproduce throughout the year, the peak reproductive period coincides with the arrival of the rainy season (end of March or April). Cichla is primarily a piscivore.

On LASSO for Predictive Regression,"A typical predictive regression employs a multitude of potential regressors with various degrees of persistence while their signal strength in explaining the dependent variable is often low. Variable selection in such context is of great importance. In this paper, we explore the pitfalls and possibilities of the LASSO methods in this predictive regression framework with mixed degrees of persistence. With the presence of stationary, unit root and cointegrated predictors, we show that the adaptive LASSO maintains the consistent variable selection and the oracle property due to its penalty scheme that accommodates the system of regressors. On the contrary, conventional LASSO does not have this desirable feature as the penalty is imposed according to the marginal behavior of each individual regressor. We demonstrate this theoretical property via extensive Monte Carlo simulations, and evaluate its empirical performance for short- and long-horizon stock return predictability.",2018,arXiv: Econometrics
"Thanatosis (death feigning) in the frog Rhinella crucifer ( Wied-Neuwied, 1821 )","against predators, including fleeing, immobility, and thanatosis (Toledo and Haddad, 2009). The latter, also known as death-feigning, occurs when the animal assumes a posture that makes it appear dead, perhaps when it is under attack by a predator. It differs from shrinking, a behaviour during which a frog remains motionless and, almost without exception, has its eyes closed, foreand hind limbs bent and close to the body, and in some instances including body arching and ventral flexing of the head (Toledo et al., 2010). Thanatosis has been reported for at least 16 families of frogs (Toledo et al., 2010), including the family Bufonidae, where it is primarily reported in the genera Rhinella, Osornophryne, and Dendrophryniscus (Toledo et al., 2010; Escobar-Lasso and GÃ³nzalez-Duran, 2012).

Trend of Hospital Performance in Northern Iran: A 5-year Assessment Using Pabon Lasso Model,"Background and Objectives: The large contribution of hospitals to the function and expenditures of the healthsector makes their constant monitoring and evaluation inevitable to improve the overall performance of the healthÂ system. Built on that, the present study aimed to evaluate the trend of performance of hospitals affiliated withÂ the public hospitals (in Guilan Province, Iran) affiliated with Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME)Â using the Pabon Lasso framework. Methods: All (21) hospitals affiliated to Guilan University of Medical Sciences (GUMS) were monitored withinÂ 2010-2015. Data of BOR, BTR and ALS of these hospitals were collected using a form completed by the universityâ€™sÂ Office of Vice-chancellor for Clinical Affairs. The Pabon Lasso diagram was set up by dividing the areaÂ between BOR (horizontal) and BTR (vertical) axes into four Zones based on the average of BOR and BTRÂ values. A second Pabon Lasso diagram was also set up with the cut-off point being standard average BOR andÂ BTR values as suggested by MOHME. The data of BOR and BTR of the target hospitals were then mappedÂ onto the diagrams. Findings: The number of hospitals in Zone 1 has decreased from 6 to 3, and the number of hospitals in ZoneÂ 3 has increased from 5 to 6 during 2010 to 2015. Based on MOHMEâ€™s evaluation criteria, the average BOR ofÂ the surveyed hospitals has increased from the moderate level in 2010-2011 to the favorable level in 2014-2015.Â Moreover, the 5-year average BTR of these hospitals maintains far above the minimum favorable threshold, andÂ the 5-year average ALS of these hospitals falls in the moderate range. In 2014-2015, while 23.8% of the hospitalsÂ are located in Zone 3, 71.42% are located in Zone 2, and there is no hospital located in Zone 1. Conclusions: AOur results suggest that the performance of GUMS hospitals has been on an increasing trendÂ in the recent years. Nonetheless, when considering MOHMEâ€™s evaluation criteria, most of the hospitals are stillÂ located in the second Zone of Pabon Lasso Model, which corresponds to low BOR and high BTR. This informationÂ recommends avoidance of further bed development, and rather using under-utilized beds in high demandÂ healthcare services in order to achieve higher hospital performance in future years",2015,international journal of hospital research
Lasso regularization for left-censored Gaussian outcome and high-dimensional predictors,"BackgroundBiological assays for the quantification of markers may suffer from a lack of sensitivity and thus from an analytical detection limit. This is the case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load. Below this threshold the exact value is unknown and values are consequently left-censored. Statistical methods have been proposed to deal with left-censoring but few are adapted in the context of high-dimensional data.MethodsWe propose to reverse the Buckley-James least squares algorithm to handle left-censored data enhanced with a Lasso regularization to accommodate high-dimensional predictors. We present a Lasso-regularized Buckley-James least squares method with both non-parametric imputation using Kaplan-Meier and parametric imputation based on the Gaussian distribution, which is typically assumed for HIV viral load data after logarithmic transformation. Cross-validation for parameter-tuning is based on an appropriate loss function that takes into account the different contributions of censored and uncensored observations. We specify how these techniques can be easily implemented using available R packages. The Lasso-regularized Buckley-James least square method was compared to simple imputation strategies to predict the response to antiretroviral therapy measured by HIV viral load according to the HIV genotypic mutations. We used a dataset composed of several clinical trials and cohorts from the Forum for Collaborative HIV Research (HIV Med. 2008;7:27-40). The proposed methods were also assessed on simulated data mimicking the observed data.ResultsApproaches accounting for left-censoring outperformed simple imputation methods in a high-dimensional setting. The Gaussian Buckley-James method with cross-validation based on the appropriate loss function showed the lowest prediction error on simulated data and, using real data, the most valid results according to the current literature on HIV mutations.ConclusionsThe proposed approach deals with high-dimensional predictors and left-censored outcomes and has shown its interest for predicting HIV viral load according to HIV mutations.",2018,BMC Medical Research Methodology

Preface to Pachyonychia Congenita Symposium Proceedings,"These Symposium Proceedings summarize current clinical, therapeutic, and scientific challenges associated with developing effective treatments for pachyonychia congenita (PC). The impetus for these papers was the First International Pachyonychia Congenita Symposium, held on February 12â€“16, 2004, at the Yarrow Hotel in Park City, Utah. This symposium was sponsored by The Pachyonychia Congenita Fund (Pachyonychia Congenita Project/PC Project), a USA public charity founded in November 2003, which supports clinical and research activities related to the treatment of pachyonychia congenita. The goal of this symposium was to gather thought leaders, expert clinicians and scientists to explore approaches to the treatment and eventual cure for the disorder. As reflected in these Symposium Proceedings, the major topics of presentations included our most current understanding of the clinical and histologic features, therapeutic approaches, and the molecular genetics of the disease. In addition, â€˜â€˜special topicsâ€™â€™ sessions focused on the most practical and efficient approaches to developing an eventual cure for PC, including discussions of the most useful model systems and genetic and pharmacologic approaches. Finally, the difficulty of initiating clinical trials and developing therapeutics for rare disorders of the skin was discussed at considerable length, with an emphasis on maximizing the relationship between academia and industry in this effort. All participants in this symposium were encouraged to critically evaluate options, and the roundtable discussion format permitted a productive and frequently lively exchange of ideas and information. Sancy Leachman, Patti Champine, Mary Schwartz, and Jan Schwartz organized the symposium, which opened with a series of lectures by Irwin McLean, Leonard Milstone, Alfred Lewin, Markus Landthaler, Mario Capecchi, Olga Igoucheva, and Roger Kaspar. These lectures focused on potential gene therapy technologies that could be applied to PC. The technologies that were considered included siRNA, ribozymes, triplex oligonucleotides, homologous recombination techniques, RNA lassos, and other oligonucleotidemediated gene repair techniques. The RNA-mediated technologies would aim to decrease the intracellular levels of the affected keratin and would have the potential advantages of being highly specific for the mutated RNA. These techniques would also have a transient, and thus reversible, character. The primary disadvantage to the RNA-based approach is that it would likely require ongoing repetitive administration in order to be effective. The gene correction therapies utilizing homologous recombination, triplexforming oligonucleotides, or other oligonucleotide-mediated repair techniques have the advantage of offering a more permanent correction of the mutated keratin, but are also less feasible in the short-term because of the difficulty in getting an adequate number of cells corrected in vivo. The problem of delivering these types of gene therapy agents to the nails and hyperkeratotic skin of PC patients was discussed in a lecture by Bhaskar Thyagarajan. It was concluded by the conference attendees that delivery will be one of the major obstacles to overcome in the treatment of PC. The next session included a thorough examination of the clinical, histologic, and molecular genetic features of PC led by Philip Fleckman, Frances Smith, and Maurice van Steensel. It has now become clear through mutation screening of PC patients that the clinical phenotype of PC is somewhat variable and that the two major categories, PC-1 and PC-2, can be discriminated by mutations in K6a or K16 for PC-1 and K6b or K17 for PC-2. The clinical and genetic discussions ultimately led to the development of a questionnaire designed to facilitate further elucidation of genotype-phenotype relationships in PC. This questionnaire has now been completed by 57 participants in the newly formed PC Registry, and data from these questionnaires are reported in Leachman et al in this issue. The final session of the conference focused on the potential model systems available to advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of PC as well as serve as preclinical models for therapeutic agents. Dennis Roop and Pauline Wong described the currently available cellular and mouse models. Consensus was reached by the group that a PC mouse model would be an extremely valuable tool for both basic and pre-clinical investigation. Various approaches to the development of this model were discussed, and it was felt that one of the best strategies would be to create a mutant K6a knock-in to try to replicate the dominant-negative effect of the mutation. It was also decided that models containing only a minor modification of the mouse gene as well as a â€˜â€˜humanizedâ€™â€™ model containing human regulatory regions should be attempted. An important outcome of the meeting was the development of the International Pachyonychia Congenita Consortium (IPCC), a collaborative team of clinicians and scientists interested in pursuing PC care and research. A major accomplishment of the IPCC has been the development of a collaborative research strategy in which PC research projects are integrated to maximize efficiency and minimize cost by sharing key resources and reagents. The IPCC has identified several important gaps in our understanding of PC and in the approaches that have been taken toward devel-",2005,
Fast Newton-type Methods for Total Variation Regularization,"Numerous applications in statistics, signal processing, and machine learning regularize using Total Variation (TV) penalties. We study anisotropic (l1-based) TV and also a related l2-norm variant. We consider for both variants associated (1D) proximity operators, which lead to challenging optimization problems. We solve these problems by developing Newton-type methods that outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms. More importantly, our ID-TV algorithms serve as building blocks for solving the harder task of computing 2- (and higher)-dimensional TV proximity. We illustrate the computational benefits of our methods by applying them to several applications: (i) image de-noising; (ii) image deconvolution (by plugging in our TV solvers into publicly available software); and (iii) four variants of fused-lasso. The results show large speedupsâ€”and to support our claims, we provide software accompanying this paper.",2011,
Penalized solutions to functional regression problems,"Recent technological advances in continuous biological monitoring and personal exposure assessment have led to the collection of subject-specific functional data. A primary goal in such studies is to assess the relationship between the functional predictors and the functional responses. The historical functional linear model (HFLM) can be used to model such dependencies of the response on the history of the predictor values. An estimation procedure for the regression coefficients that uses a variety of regularization techniques is proposed. An approximation of the regression surface relating the predictor to the outcome by a finite-dimensional basis expansion is used, followed by penalization of the coefficients of the neighboring basis functions by restricting the size of the coefficient differences to be small. Penalties based on the absolute values of the basis function coefficient differences (corresponding to the LASSO) and the squares of these differences (corresponding to the penalized spline methodology) are studied. The fits are compared using an extension of the Akaike Information Criterion that combines the error variance estimate, degrees of freedom of the fit and the norm of the bases function coefficients. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated via simulations. The LASSO penalty applied to the linearly transformed coefficients yields sparser representations of the estimated regression surface, while the quadratic penalty provides solutions with the smallest L(2)-norm of the basis functions coefficients. Finally, the new estimation procedure is applied to the analysis of the effects of occupational particulate matter (PM) exposure on the heart rate variability (HRV) in a cohort of boilermaker workers. Results suggest that the strongest association between PM exposure and HRV in these workers occurs as a result of point exposures to the increased levels of particulate matter corresponding to smoking breaks.",2007,Computational statistics & data analysis
Penalized basis models for very large spatial datasets,"Many modern spatial models express the stochastic variation component as a basis expansion with random coefficients. Low rank models, approximate spectral decompositions, multiresolution representations, stochastic partial differential equations and empirical orthogonal functions all fall within this basic framework. Given a particular basis, stochastic dependence relies on flexible modeling of the coefficients. Under a Gaussianity assumption, we propose a graphical model family for the stochastic coefficients by parameterizing the precision matrix. Sparsity in the precision matrix is encouraged using a penalized likelihood framework. Computations follow from a majorization-minimization approach, a byproduct of which is a connection to the graphical lasso. The result is a flexible nonstationary spatial model that is adaptable to very large datasets. We apply the model to two large and heterogeneous spatial datasets in statistical climatology and recover physically sensible graphical structures. Moreover, the model performs competitively against the popular LatticeKrig model in predictive cross-validation, but substantially improves the Akaike information criterion score.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Gradual adaptation of bone structure to aquatic lifestyle in extinct sloths from Peru,"Non-pathological densification (osteosclerosis) and swelling (pachyostosis) of bones are the main modifications affecting the skeleton of land vertebrates (tetrapods) that returned to water. However, a precise temporal calibration of the acquisition of such adaptations is still wanting. Here, we assess the timing of such acquisition using the aquatic sloth Thalassocnus, from the Neogene of the Pisco Formation, Peru. This genus is represented by five species occurring in successive vertebrate-bearing horizons of distinct ages. It yields the most detailed data about the gradual acquisition of aquatic adaptations among tetrapods, in displaying increasing osteosclerosis and pachyostosis through time. Such modifications, reflecting a shift in the habitat from terrestrial to aquatic, occurred over a short geological time span (ca 4 Myr). Otherwise, the bones of terrestrial pilosans (sloths and anteaters) are much more compact than the mean mammalian condition, which suggests that the osteosclerosis of Thalassocnus may represent an exaptation.",2014,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences
Efficiency of genomic prediction for boar taint reduction in Danish Landrace pigs,"Genetic selection against boar taint, which is caused by high skatole and androstenone concentrations in fat, is a more acceptable alternative than is the current practice of castration. Genomic predictors offer an opportunity to overcome the limitations of such selection caused by the phenotype being expressed only in males at slaughter, and this study evaluated different approaches to obtain such predictors. Samples from 1000 pigs were included in a design which was dominated by 421 sib pairs, each pair having one animal with high and one with low skatole concentration (â‰¥0.3Â Î¼g/g). All samples were measured for both skatole and androstenone and genotyped using the Illumina SNP60 porcine BeadChip for 62Â 153 single nucleotide polymorphisms. The accuracy of predicting phenotypes was assessed by cross-validation using six different genomic evaluation methods: genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and five Bayesian regression methods. In addition, this was compared to the accuracy of predictions using only QTL that showed genome-wide significance. The range of accuracies obtained by different prediction methods was narrow for androstenone, between 0.29 (Bayes Lasso) and 0.31 (Bayes B), and wider for skatole, between 0.21 (GBLUP) and 0.26 (Bayes SSVS). Relative accuracies, corrected for h(2) , were 0.54-0.56 and 0.75-0.94 for androstenone and skatole respectively. The whole-genome evaluation methods gave greater accuracy than using only the QTL detected in the data. The results demonstrate that GBLUP for androstenone is the simplest genomic technology to implement and was also close to the most accurate method. More specialised models may be preferable for skatole.",2015,Animal Genetics
Identification of Linear Time Varying Systems using Basis Pursuit,"System identification involves creating mathematical models of systems using measurements of their inputs and outputs. Linear time-varying systems form an important sub-class of models that require the use of specialized system identification techniques. One such approach involves expanding the time-varying parameters onto a set of temporal basis functions and then estimating the resulting expansion coefficients. This, however, requires the estimation of a large number of parameters and often results in extreme noise sensitivity. In this paper a novel algorithm for identifying time-varying systems is presented. It combines a temporal expansion with a term selection step that uses the ""least absolute shrinkage and selection operator"", or Lasso. The Lasso term selection technique constructs a model structure with a nearly minimal number of non-zero terms, and hence with relatively low estimation variances. The algorithm is demonstrated by using it to detect changes in the dynamic stiffness of the human elbow immediately following the onset of a broadband perturbation",2005,2005 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology 27th Annual Conference

Decoding force from deep brain electrodes in Parkinsonian patients,"Limitations of many Brain Machine Interface (BMI) systems using invasive electrodes include reliance on single neurons and decoding limited to kinematics only. This study investigates whether force-related information is present in the local field potential (LFP) recorded with deep brain electrodes using data from 14 patients with Parkinson's disease. A classifier based on logistic regression (LR) is developed to classify various force stages, using 10-fold cross validation. Least Absolute and Shrinkage Operator (Lasso) is then employed in order to identify the features with the most predictivity. The results show that force-related information is present in the LFP, and it is possible to distinguish between various force stages using certain frequency-domain (delta, beta, gamma) and time-domain (mobility) features in real-time.",2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)

Physicians can assure adult CF patients contemplating marriage that they have a reaamiable chance for normal sexual functioning. We attempted to answer the following questions about the sexual functioning of married patients with cystic fibrosis: Is it possible for patients with CF to have normal sex lives-ie, heterosexual intercourse on a regular basis? Do these patients have characteristic sexual difficulties? Is there a threshold level of physical deterioration that makes sex problematic or impossible? STUDY POPULATION AND METhOD All patients at the Cleveland Cystic Fibrosis Center who had been married at least six months as of July 1, 1979, were evaluated. Cystic fibrosis was diagnosed by a positive sweat test, as well as typical digestive symptoms, pulmonary involvement, or a family history. Serial medical data were available on all patients. Clinical scoring used a modificationâ€™1 of Shwachman and Kulczyckiâ€™s system.1â€™ In this system, from 1 to 25 points are assigned to each of four categories: general activity; pulmonary physical findings; nutritional status; chest roentgenogram. The best possible total score is 100 points. We arbitrarily classified cases with a total score of 75 or more as mild, those with 50 to 75 points as moderate, and those with fewer than 50 points as severe cases. Pulmonary function data, including vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity at one second (FEy1), residual volume (RV), and maximum breathing capacity (MBC), were obtained using standard spirometricâ€™3 and total body plethysmographic methods.14 The patients were seen during a hospitalization or at one of their regular outpatient visits. A Cystic Fibrosis Center physician explained the study and obtained preliminary data. There were two main sources of sexual data: a one-hour interview with a psychiatrist and individual sexual questionnaires completed both by patients and spouses after the interviews. The questionnaire included detailed questions about sexual desire, arousal, dyspareunia, patterns of orgasmic attainment, emotional satisfaction, masturbation, and overall summary questions about happiness with the existing sexual relationship. The interviews followed this general outline: (1) clarification of the purpose of the interview and affirmation of the patientâ€™s consent; (2) general social information, le, age, educational background, spouseâ€™s job history, duration of Downloaded From: http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/pdfaccess.ashx?url=/data/journals/chest/21283/ on 06/21/2017 CHEST, 81: 4, APRIL 1982 SEXUAL FUNCTION IN CYSTIC FiBROSIS 423 marriage; (3) history and nature of nonsexual relationship -how the couple met, seasons for attraction, congeniality, life styles; (4) extent of social disability due to CF; (5) sexual history: frequency of sexual contact, level of desire, characteristics of arousal and orgasm, degree of satisfaction from sex, perceptions of problematic aspects of sexual relaflonship; (6) modification of sexual behavior due to CF; (7) attitudes toward life expectancy and infertility. On the basis of interview and questionnaire information, the couples were assigned to one of four groups: 1 Aproblematic Group.-Neither spouse has problems with any of the four basic components of sexual functionje, desire, arousal, orgasm, emotional satisfaction. Consistent, mutual sexual desire and arousal are present. Both partners achieve orgasm on a regular basis ( greater than 50 percent for women ) . Both consistently experience emotional satisfaction from sex. These conditions had to exist for at least six months.15 2. Good Sexual Relationship.-Criteria similar to aproblematic group with allowance for rare component problems; for example, inability to ejaculate because of severe coughing, inability to become aroused when fatigued, or inability to maintain arousal because of dyspnea. Although it is often difficult to distinguish between them, couples with aproblematic and good relationships have been separated initially. 3. Minor Sexual Prthlems.-Patients with episodic seeondary problems a bit too severe to be classified in the good relationship group. 4. Serious Sexual Problems.-Persistent, major difficulties in at least one of the four components of sexual functioning.

"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, 2nd Edition","During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.

This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.

Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.",2009,
A prognostic model for predicting overall survival in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) men treated with second-line chemotherapy.,"5011 Background: Although several prognostic models for overall survival (OS) have been developed and validated in men with chemotherapy naive mCRPC, this work sought to develop and validate a prognostic model to predict OS in men who had progressed following first-line chemotherapy, and were receiving second line chemotherapy. Methods: Data from a phase III trial of cabazitaxel plus prednisone compared to mitoxantrone plus prednisone in mCRPC men who had developed progressive disease following first-line chemotherapy (TROPIC trial) were used. The TROPIC data was randomly split into training (n=507) and testing (n=248) sets. A separate data set consisting of 488 men previously treated with docetaxel who were randomly assigned to either satraplatin and prednisone or placebo and prednisone (SPARC trial), was used as a second testing set for external validation. Adaptive Lasso selected nine baseline prognostic factors of OS. A predictive score was computed from the estimated regression coefficients and used ...",2017,Journal of Clinical Oncology
Towards a blood-based diagnostic panel for bipolar disorder,"BACKGROUND
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a costly, devastating and life shortening mental disorder that is often misdiagnosed, especially on initial presentation. Misdiagnosis frequently results in ineffective treatment. We investigated the utility of a biomarker panel as a diagnostic test for BD.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
We performed a meta-analysis of eight case-control studies to define a diagnostic biomarker panel for BD. After validating the panel on established BD patients, we applied it to undiagnosed BD patients. We analysed 249 BD, 122 pre-diagnostic BD, 75 pre-diagnostic schizophrenia and 90 first onset major depression disorder (MDD) patients and 371 controls. The biomarker panel was identified using ten-fold cross-validation with lasso regression applied to the 87 analytes available across the meta-analysis studies. We identified 20 protein analytes with excellent predictive performance [area under the curve (AUC)â©¾0.90]. Importantly, the panel had a good predictive performance (AUC 0.84) to differentiate 12 misdiagnosed BD patients from 90 first onset MDD patients, and a fair to good predictive performance (AUC 0.79) to differentiate between 110 pre-diagnostic BD patients and 184 controls. We also demonstrated the disease specificity of the panel.


CONCLUSIONS
An early and accurate diagnosis has the potential to delay or even prevent the onset of BD. This study demonstrates the potential utility of a biomarker panel as a diagnostic test for BD.",2016,"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity"
The BOX-LASSO with application to GSSK modulation in massive MIMO systems,"The BOX-LASSO is a variant of the popular LASSO that includes an additional box-constraint. We propose its use as a decoder in modern Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communication systems with modulation methods such as the Generalized Space Shift Keying (GSSK) modulation, which produces constellation vectors that are inherently sparse and with bounded elements. In that direction, we prove novel explicit asymptotic characterizations of the squared-error and of the per-element error rate of the BOX-LASSO, under iid Gaussian measurements. In particular, the theoretical predictions can be used to quantify the improved performance of the BOX-LASSO, when compared to the previously used standard LASSO. We include simulation results that validate both these premises and our theoretical predictions.",2017,2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)
Improved Compressed Sensing-Based Sparse Channel Estimation Method for Broadband Communication System,"In this paper, we investigate various channel estimators that exploiting channel sparsity for broadband frequency-selective communication system. As the wireless channels tend to exhibit sparse structure in high-dimensional space, e.g., delay spread, Doppler spread and space spread. Some sparse channel estimators have been proposed based on the novel theory of compressed sensing. For convex relaxation algorithms, namely LASSO and DS, they turn to solve the convex optimization problem. For greedy algorithms, in form of compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithm, refine the sparse solution iteratively. Numerical simulations are used to evaluate the proposed algorithms in comparison to the conventional least-squares (LS) channel estimator. We observe that the convex relaxation algorithms outperform the LS method for the sparse multipath channel. On the other hand, the greedy algorithms led by CoSaMP uniformly outperform the LS and convex approach.",2012,
PAC-Bayesian bounds for sparse regression estimation with exponential weights,"We consider the sparse regression model where the number of parametersp is larger than the sample size n. The difficulty when consideringhigh-dimensional problems is to propose estimators achieving a good compromisebetween statistical and computational performances. The BIC estimatorfor instance performs well from the statistical point of view [11] but can onlybe computed for values of p of at most a few tens. The Lasso estimator issolution of a convex minimization problem, hence computable for large valueof p. However stringent conditions on the design are required to establish fastrates of convergence for this estimator. Dalalyan and Tsybakov [19] proposea method achieving a good compromise between the statistical and computationalaspects of the problem. Their estimator can be computed for reasonablylarge p and satisfies nice statistical properties under weak assumptions on thedesign. However, [19] proposes sparsity oracle inequalities in expectation forthe empirical excess risk only. In this paper, we propose an aggregation proceduresimilar to that of [19] but with improved statistical performances. Ourmain theoretical result is a sparsity oracle inequality in probability for the trueexcess risk for a version of exponential weight estimator. We also propose aMCMC method to compute our estimator for reasonably large values of p.",2011,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Post-Lasso Inference for High-Dimensional Regression,"Among the most popular variable selection procedures in high-dimensional regression, Lasso provides a solution path to rank the variables and determines a cut-off position on the path to select variables and estimate coefficients. In this paper, we consider variable selection from a new perspective motivated by the frequently occurred phenomenon that relevant variables are not completely distinguishable from noise variables on the solution path. We propose to characterize the positions of the first noise variable and the last relevant variable on the path. We then develop a new variable selection procedure to control over-selection of the noise variables ranking after the last relevant variable, and, at the same time, retain a high proportion of relevant variables ranking before the first noise variable. Our procedure utilizes the recently developed covariance test statistic and Q statistic in post-selection inference. In numerical examples, our method compares favorably with other existing methods in selection accuracy and the ability to interpret its results.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
WinBUGS: a tutorial,"The reinvention of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and their implementation within the Bayesian framework in the early 1990s has established the Bayesian approach as one of the standard methods within the applied quantitative sciences. Their extensive use in complex real life problems has lead to the increased demand for a friendly and easily accessible software, which implements Bayesian models by exploiting the possibilities provided by MCMC algorithms. WinBUGS is the software that covers this increased need. It is the Windows version of BUGS (Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling) package appeared in the mid-1990s. It is a free and a relatively easy tool that estimates the posterior distribution of any parameter of interest in complicated Bayesian models. In this article, we present an overview of the basic features of WinBUGS, including information for the model and prior specification, the code and its compilation, and the analysis and the interpretation of the MCMC output.

Immunoreactivity of Protein Gene Product 9.5 and Synaptosomal-associated Protein 25 in the Retina of the Formosan Rock Monkey Following Optic Nerve Transection,"To investigate the retrograde degeneration of primate retinal neurons, the left optic nerves of 3 Formosan rock monkeys were transected intraorbitally. The pattern of organization of protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), a specific neuronal marker, and synaptosomalassociated protein 25 kDa (SNAP-25), were examined 1 mo after axotomy. A severe loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons was observed, while photoreceptors became reactive in the lesioned retina as detected by PGP 9.5 immunoreactivity. A significant decrease of PGP 9.5 and SNAP-25 immunoreactivity in the plexiform and nerve fiber layers was also detected in the retina ipsilateral to the axotomized retina. The sublayers were mixed and indistinguishable in some areas of the lesioned retina, indicating that degeneration occurred not only in the retinal ganglion cells but also in other populations; further, the alteration was more severe in the monkey retina as compared with results from our previous studies performed in the rodent optic system. Our findings also show that PGP 9.5 and SNAP-25 are good markers for investigating the effects of neuronal injury and the mechanisms that underlie the processes of neuronal degeneration.",1997,Zoological Studies
Subspecific Status of Least Tern Populations in Texas: North American Implications,"AnsrRncr.-Analyses of seven bill, leg, wing, and plumage characters measured from 267 museum specimens of adult Least Terns (Sterna antillurum) revealed significant morphological differences between sexes but not among three subspecies (antillarum, athalassos, and browni) currently recognized in North America. While individual morphometric characters sometimes did not overlap between a pair of subspecies, discriminant analysis employing criteria developed from the complete morphometric data set correctly classified >90% of antillarum specimens but misclassified 39% and 5 1% of athalassos and browni specimens, respectively. Cluster analysis did not segregate specimens into groups consistent with current subspecific taxonomy. Electrophoretic variation in proteins encoded by 50 loci revealed no genetic distinctions between S. a. antillarum and S. a. athalassos for 22 specimens from four breeding sites on the Texas coast, Rio Grande, and Texas panhandle rivers. These data illustrated continued difficulty in distinguishing endangered and nonendangered â€œformsâ€ of the same species. Distinctions proposed in original descriptions of North American Least Tern subspecies are not sufficiently definitive; we recommend reassessment of subspecies within the entire species taxon. Received 20 May 1991, accepted 22 Oct. 1991. Three subspecies of Least Terns (Sterna antillarum, formerly S. albifions) are recognized from North America (A.O.U. 1957, 1983). Coastal Least Terns (S. a. antillarum) nest along the Atlantic seaboard from southern Maine (Hunter 1975) to Florida, the Gulf Coast, and Caribbean islands (A.O.U. 1957, 1983). Interior Least Terns (S. a. athalassos) breed in the Mississippi Valley; along tributaries of the Missouri, Arkansas, and Red rivers from North Dakota to Texas; and at scattered sites in the Rio Grande drainage of New Mexico and Texas (Hardy 1957, Downing 1980, Whitman 1988). California Least Terns (S. a. browni) are restricted to a breeding range along the Pacific Coast from San Francisco Bay, California, to Baja California, Mexico (California Least Tern Recovery Team 1980). Number and size of S. antillarum breeding populations have declined in recent times owing to disturbance or destruction of nesting and feeding habitat by shoreline development, dredging, diversion and impoundment",1992,The Wilson Journal of Ornithology
The de-biased group Lasso estimation for varying coefficient models,"There has been a lot of attention on the de-biased or de-sparsified Lasso since it was proposed in 2014. The Lasso is very useful in variable selection and obtaining initial estimators for other methods in high-dimensional settings. However, it is well-known that the Lasso produces biased estimators. Therefore several authors simultaneously proposed the de-biased Lasso to fix this drawback and carry out statistical inferences based on the de-biased Lasso estimators. The de-biased Lasso procedures need desirable estimators of high-dimensional precision matrices for bias correction. Thus the research is almost limited to linear regression models with some restrictive assumptions, generalized linear models with stringent assumptions and the like. To our knowledge, there are a few papers on linear regression models with group structure, but no result on structured nonparametric regression models such as varying coefficient models. In this paper, we apply the de-biased group Lasso to varying coefficient models and closely examine the theoretical properties and the effects of approximation errors involved in nonparametric regression. Some simulation results are also presented.",2019,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
Super Resolution of Image Using Sparse Representation of Image Patches with LASSO Approximation on CUDA Platform,"Image super resolution refers to increasing the physical dimensions of image to overcome resolution limitations originated from certain imaging sensors such as light sensitivity of sensor, environmental lightning conditions, physical size of sensor and also of each pixel w.r.t the sensor. With the help of sparse code and the dictionary it is possible to reconstruct good quality image with high resolution. Training images are used for obtaining the sample patches which are used for obtaining coefficients of the dictionary. Therefore the process of image super resolution is carried from sparse representation of low resolution image patch generating image of high resolution. Although method is effective, it is slow due to need of processing large number of image patches. Using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) approximation which is one of the regression analysis method where the approximation of solution is performed.

Intergenerational relations: Grievances of the elderly in rural China.,"In every society, there is potential for intergenerational conflicts in the family. Tensions, grievances, and disputes that occur between generations in the family are important areas of sociological study (Felstiner, William, and Sarat, 1980; Mancini and Blieszner, 1989). In a stable society, when tensions, grievances, and disputes occur between generations, tradition and history provide a blueprint for management and predictability. However social changes make the blueprint obsolete. New sources of conflicts, new conflict relationships and the absence of traditional social mechanisms to manage or resolve conflicts are common in many developing countries (Vlassoff and Vlassoff, 1980; Goldstein, Schuler, and Ross, 1983; Martin, 1985).",1992,Journal of Comparative Family Studies
"Unique clusters of Archaea in Salar de Huasco, an athalassohaline evaporitic basin of the Chilean Altiplano.","Analyses of clone libraries from water and sediments of different sites from Salar de Huasco, a high-altitude athalassohaline wetland in the Chilean Altiplano, revealed the presence of five unique clusters of uncultured Archaea that have not been previously reported or specifically assigned. These sequences were distantly related (83-96% sequence identity) to a limited number of other clone sequences and revealed no identity to cultured Archaea. The abundance of Archaea and Bacteria was estimated using qPCR and community composition was examined through the construction of clone libraries of archaeal 16S rRNA gene. Archaea were found to be dominant over Bacteria in sediments from two saline sites (sites H4: 6.31 x 10(4) and site H6: 1.37 x 10(4) microS cm(-1)) and in one of the water samples (freshwater from site H0: 607 muS cm(-1)). Euryarchaeotal sequences were more abundant than crenarchaeotal sequences. Many of the clone sequences (52%) were similar to uncultured archaeal groups found in marine ecosystems having identity values between 99% and 97%. A major fraction of the sequences (40%) were members of Methanobacteria, while others were included in the Marine Benthic Groups B and D, the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group, the Terrestrial Miscellaneous Euryarchaeotal Group, Marine Group I and Halobacteria. The presence of uncultured archaeal groups in Salar de Huasco extends their known distribution in inland waters, providing new clues about their possible function in the environment.",2010,FEMS microbiology ecology
Learned dictionaries for sparse image representation: properties and results,"Sparse representation of images using learned dictionaries have been shown to work well for applications like image denoising, impainting, image compression, etc. In this paper dictionary properties are reviewed from a theoretical approach, and experimental results for learned dictionaries are presented. The main dictionary properties are the upper and lower frame (dictionary) bounds, and (mutual) coherence properties based on the angle between dictionary atoms. Both â„“0 sparsity and â„“1 sparsity are considered by using a matching pursuit method, order recursive matching Pursuit (ORMP), and a basis pursuit method, i.e. LARS or Lasso. For dictionary learning the following methods are considered: Iterative least squares (ILS-DLA or MOD), recursive least squares (RLS-DLA), K-SVD and online dictionary learning (ODL). Finally, it is shown how these properties relate to an image compression example.",2011,
Testing for high-dimensional network parameters in auto-regressive models.,"High-dimensional auto-regressive models provide a natural way to model influence between $M$ actors given multi-variate time series data for $T$ time intervals. While there has been considerable work on network estimation, there is limited work in the context of inference and hypothesis testing. In particular, prior work on hypothesis testing in time series has been restricted to linear Gaussian auto-regressive models. From a practical perspective, it is important to determine suitable statistical tests for connections between actors that go beyond the Gaussian assumption. In the context of \emph{high-dimensional} time series models, confidence intervals present additional estimators since most estimators such as the Lasso and Dantzig selectors are biased which has led to \emph{de-biased} estimators. In this paper we address these challenges and provide convergence in distribution results and confidence intervals for the multi-variate AR(p) model with sub-Gaussian noise, a generalization of Gaussian noise that broadens applicability and presents numerous technical challenges. The main technical challenge lies in the fact that unlike Gaussian random vectors, for sub-Gaussian vectors zero correlation does not imply independence. The proof relies on using an intricate truncation argument to develop novel concentration bounds for quadratic forms of dependent sub-Gaussian random variables. Our convergence in distribution results hold provided $T = \Omega((s \vee \rho)^2 \log^2 M)$, where $s$ and $\rho$ refer to sparsity parameters which matches existed results for hypothesis testing with i.i.d. samples. We validate our theoretical results with simulation results for both block-structured and chain-structured networks.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Machine Learning in Spatial Study of Asthma Rate Distribution in Los Angeles County,"Public health studies have revealed numerous links between certain factors and asthma. Due to various causes of asthma attack and different reactions of people, it is necessary to construct a comprehensive model identifying key elements. Machine learning methods can be beneficial in dealing with multi data. We collected 35 variables reflecting environmental, social, medical and demographical status in Los Angeles County in 2013 based on the unit of census tract and built three linear regression models in explanation of asthma rate spatial disparity. Ordinary least square (OLS) method, principal component analysis (PCA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) are used in each model respectively. We prefer manually selected variables for explicit interpretation while LASSO behaves well in compressing a model. Furthermore, our results indicated that a neighborhood's socioeconomic composition (age, poverty of a neighborhood) has a substantial effect on asthma rate, but nonetheless, environmental risk and spatial accessibility factors also contribute to outcomes.",2018,2018 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)
"Phosphate deposits of Neogene age in Greece. Mineralogy, geochemistry and genetic implications","Abstract In Greece, several occurrences of phosphates have been located in Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks. The aim of the present paper is to describe the mineralogy, geochemistry and the origin of the phosphates deposited in marine and lacustrine basins of Neogene age in Greece. Phosphates of marine origin formed in an outer shelf-upper slope environment (Palliki Peninsula, Kefalonia Island) as well as in a hemipelagic environment (Heraklion, Crete Island). In both the deposits, the phosphate minerals belong to the apatite group. In Kefalonia Island, phosphatic material accumulations occur in the field as scattered or accumulated vertebrate bones, fish teeth and other biogenic components, hosted in a sandy limestone of Upper Tortonian age. On a microscopic scale, in the groundmass of the limestone, phosphate minerals are present as fillings and secondarily as replacements of foraminiferal and other calcareous microfossil tests. In Crete Island, burrowed cobbles and phosphatic concretions up to 10Â cm in diameter have been detected east of Heraklion town. The phosphatic material is hosted in a sandy marlstone that is interbedded with diatomaceous rocks of Middle Pliocene age. Phosphates of lacustrine origin have been formed in the NWâ€“SE-oriented Upper Miocene basins of Florinaâ€“Ptolemais and Elassonaâ€“Sarantaporo, located, respectively, in western Macedonia and Thessaly, Greece. The phosphate minerals are mainly represented by Ca/Fe phosphates such as anapaite and mitridatite and secondarily by Ca phosphates of the apatite group that are hosted in a thick succession of clayey diatomite rock. They usually form lenticular layers, asymmetric lenses, nodular and botryoidal aggregates, and faecal pellet replacements. The major and trace element content of a representative set of rocks was studied. Their geochemistry was found to be controlled by the presence of detrital minerals, the host rock mineralogies, and the types of phosphate minerals present. The relatively high amounts of uranium, arsenic and barium detected in some of the phosphate rocks studied are mainly related with organic matter and are comparable to those detected in other phosphate deposits worldwide. In the deposits studied, phosphogenesis was mainly promoted by the decay of organic substances derived from diatoms, fishes and other vertebrates, leaves and trunks, and faecal pellets in a highly reducing environment on or just below the sea or lake bottom, and secondarily by the feeding of the basin with phosphate-bearing nutrients that originated in the land.",2004,Chemie Der Erde-geochemistry
Efficient pedestrian detection with group lasso,"In this paper we deal with pedestrian detection and propose the use of group lasso to learn from data a compact and meaningful representation out of a high dimensional dictionary of local features. Group lasso, a regularized method with a sparsity-enforcing penalty term, has the very nice property of performing feature selection while preserving the internal structure of the dictionary. In our study we consider in particular variable-size HoGs, whose internal structure is composed by cells and blocks: since the entries of a block need to be computed together, the feature selection process is designed so to keep them or discard them all. The detection algorithm we obtain is a very neat procedure, simple to train and computationally efficient, which allows us to achieve a very good compromise between performance and computational cost, making the method very appropriate for video surveillance applications.",2011,2011 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCV Workshops)
"Antigen Concentration Dependence of Stimulation of D N a Synthesis in Vitro by Specifically Sensitized Cells, as an Expression of ~Â£i~ Binding Characteristics of Cellular Antibody*","Cellular immune responses are characterized by a high degree of specificity. Thus, in haptenic systems delayed hypersensitivity reactions are elicited most readily by the immunizing hapten-protein conjugate (1, 2). If elicitation of a delayed reaction is attempted with the hapten conjugated to a protein different from that used for immunization, a reaction can be obtained only occasionally and then only with a relatively high concentration of the conjugate (3). Similarly, secondary responses in haptenic systems can be obtained early in the course of immunization only with the immunizing antigen (4). Late in the course of immunization, modest secondary responses can be evoked by hapten conjugated to proteins other than that used for initial immunization (hapten-heterologous protein conjugates) (5, 6). These late secondary responses elicited with hapten-heterologous protein conjugates appear to involve the stimulation of a subpopulation of cells forming antibody of exceedingly high affinity for the hapten itself (7). The specificity of cellular interactions with antigen implies the presence of a cellassociated receptor capable of reacting with antigen on the basis of structural complementarity. Furthermore, the selective pressure of antigen observed in the secondary response (7), in tolerance induction (8, 9), and in the increase in antibody affinity during the immune response (10), strongly suggests that this cell-associated receptor is virtually identical to the antibody capable of being secreted by that cell or its progeny, at least with regard to binding characteristics. Thus far, the quantitative study of the specificity of cellular immune responses, which is required to understand cell-antigen interactions on a thermodyrmmie level, has been seriously impeded by the need to utilize the intact animal to obtain these reactions.",2003,
Robust multi-sensor classification via joint sparse representation,"In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task multi-variate (MTMV) sparse representation method for multi-sensor classification, which takes into account correlations between sensors simultaneously while considering joint sparsity within each sensor's observations. This approach can be seen as the generalized model of multi-task and multivariate Lasso, where all the multi-sensor data are jointly represented by a sparse linear combination of training data. We further modify our MTMV model by including a clutter noise term that is also assume to be sparse in feature domain. An efficient algorithm based on alternative direction method is proposed for both models. Extensive experiments are conducted on real data set and the results are compared with the conventional discriminative classifiers to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",2011,14th International Conference on Information Fusion
Differential effects of native vs. invasive predators on a common Caribbean reef fish,"Predators may have consumptive (lethal) and non-consumptive (sub-lethal) effects on prey. Non-consumptive effects include altered behavior and reduced growth and fecundity. Native prey may not recognize non-native predators as a threat, and therefore may suffer pronounced effects. Additionally, non-native predators may elicit different behavioral responses from prey compared to native predators. Theory predicts that consumptive effects should be greater for non-native predators (due to prey naivetÃ©), and non-consumptive effects should be greater for native predators (due to predator recognition). To test these hypotheses, I monitored bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) in the presence of invasive predatory Pacific lionfish (Pterois spp.), a native predator (graysby, Cephalopholis cruentata), and an egg predator (bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum). Body size and location of lionfish and graysby were monitored on reefs in the Bahamas. Bicolor fecundity was measured as the number and size of egg-masses that individual fish laid. Bicolor fecundity was negatively correlated with lionfish density but not graysby or bluehead density. Neither predator had a detectable effect on bicolor body size, but lionfish density was negatively correlated with the size of mature adult damselfish. I observed behavioral responses of bicolors to the two piscivores, to bluehead wrasse, and to two herbivorous fishes (Acanthurus coeruleus, Scarus spp.) as non-aggressive controls. Bicolors changed behavior (feeding and aggression) in the presence of all native fishes, but not in the presence of lionfish. Thus, differential effects exist between native and non-native predators, and invasive lionfish pose a non-consumptive threat to bicolor damselfish via reduced growth and fecundity.",2018,Environmental Biology of Fishes
Clinical decision support systems: the fascination with closed-loop control.,"To the engineer a closed-loop control system refers to using a controller with a feedback loop to control states or outputs of a dynamic system. That dynamic system might be the cruise (speed) control on your automobile, maintaining a patientâ€™s paO 2 with a ventilator, controlling depth of anesthesia with an anesthesia machine, or controlling arterial blood pressure with medications from an IV pump. To a cowboy from the Wild West a closed â€œloopâ€ might be considered a lariat or lasso rope, used to rope cattle. Similarly, for some in medical informatics, closed-loop control means surrounding a medical problem area to better manage it. I suggest that, in fact, there is a broad range of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems and that closed-loop controllers represent only one specif ic type. CDS systems include diagnostic systems, intelligent Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE), alarming and alerting systems, care advice systems, etc. These CDS systems can be used to help with tasks such as optimizing blood ordering, medication selection and dosing, and using protocols to improve and optimize patient care. Since the 1950â€™s, when physicians began to understand control system theory, there has been a fascination with having these control systems be closedloop without the need for any human intervention. Bickford at the Mayo Clinic was one of the f irst to suggest closed-loop anesthesia, using the electroencephalogram (EEG) as the measure [1]. In 1968 Sheppard and his colleagues, at the University of Alabama, showed that the blood pressure of post operative open-heart patientâ€™s blood pressures could be controlled with closed-loop strategies [2]. Since those early times, when the use of closed-loop systems was the ultimate decision support strategy, there have been a myriad of other decision support methods developed. However, there still seems to be some magic in being able to â€œclose the loop.â€ Just to give an update on how we are doing some 50 to 60 years later with implementing closed-loop systems, articles in this Yearbook have addressed the topic [3, 4]. Recently, considerable literature on the clinical implementation of closed-loop control has begun to appear. Two examples: a) the accuracy and clinical feasibility closed-loop control of the hypnotic component of anesthesia was recently reported [5]; b) in addition, news reports indicate that closed-loop control of insulin administration for diabetics, the so-called â€œartif icial pancreas,â€ is coming closer to reality [6]. As I was preparing this Keynote manuscript, I began to ask myself why hadnâ€™t our group at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City developed and published ANY work on operational closed-loop control systems. After all, our entire group has hundreds of publications, and most of them are in the f ield of decision support and Medical Informatics. So, I took the opportunity to refresh my memory on the almost 50 years of Medical Informatics history that I have lived through. It quickly became apparent that as a consequence of working at LDS Hospital with our mentor Homer R. Warner [7] and colleagues T. Allan Pryor, R. Scott Evans, Paul D. Clayton, multiple graduate students and other professional colleagues, we",2009,Yearbook of medical informatics

They are buildings that present themselves as a frozen state within an evolutionary process. Like the monasteries of the European Middle Ages, they are perfectly capable of absorbing, without changing their essential structure, enlargements and reductions. They are structures designed to be able to mutate without losing the legibility of their original typological genes, both when they are constructed in different locations and when once built, undergo modifications or extensions.",2018,
Neither Fish nor Fowl: The Quest to Define the Role of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,"In March 1997 the first United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (HCHR) resigned, after almost three years in office. Assessments of the importance of the post vary greatly. Some have seen it as merely 'a small step forward for human rights', while others have portrayed it as 'symbolizfing] humanity's aspiration to achieve greater dignity for all human beings'. In announcing the appointment of a new HCHR, in June 1997, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that it was 'one of the most important appointments that I will probably have the opportunity of making .. .' Amnesty International had earlier suggested, somewhat hyperbolically, that the appointee 'will shape the next century's human rights agenda.. .' The analysis that follows seeks to take stock of the achievements and shortcomings of the HCHR at a time when the baton is passing from JosÂ£ Ayala Lasso, a cautious, low-profile, but very senior Ecuadorean diplomat, to Mary Robinson, an experienced human rights lawyer and former President of Ireland. The principal focus of the article is on the extent to which the nature of the office and the appropriate role to be played by its incumbent have been clarified by the experience to date.",1997,European Journal of International Law
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit: A Brownian Motion Analysis,"A well-known analysis of Tropp and Gilbert shows that orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) can recover a <i>k</i>-sparse <i>n</i>-dimensional real vector from <i>m</i>=4<i>k</i>log(<i>n</i>) noise-free linear measurements obtained through a random Gaussian measurement matrix with a probability that approaches one as <i>n</i>â†’âˆž. This work strengthens this result by showing that a lower number of measurements, <i>m</i>=2<i>k</i>log(<i>n</i>-<i>k</i>) , is in fact sufficient for asymptotic recovery. More generally, when the sparsity level satisfies <i>k</i><sub>min</sub> â‰¤ <i>k</i> â‰¤ <i>k</i><sub>max</sub> but is unknown, <i>m</i>=2<i>k</i><sub>max</sub>log(<i>n</i>-<i>k</i><sub>min</sub>) measurements is sufficient. Furthermore, this number of measurements is also sufficient for detection of the sparsity pattern (support) of the vector with measurement errors provided the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scales to infinity. The scaling <i>m</i>=2<i>k</i>log(<i>n</i>-<i>k</i>) exactly matches the number of measurements required by the more complex lasso method for signal recovery with a similar SNR scaling.",2012,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
"Isolation and screening of biosurfactant-producing marine bacteria from Kuantan Port, Pahang, Malaysia","Biosurfactants play an important role in bioremediation of organic pollutants such as petroleum hydrocarbon. The 
unique properties of biosurfactants make them possible to be used in the remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated 
sites. Therefore, the existence of indigenous microorganisms that have the ability to consume petroleum 
hydrocarbon as carbon source and simultaneously produce biosurfactants in order to facilitate the hydrocarbon 
metabolism can be manipulated for bioremediation purposes. In this study, isolation and screening of potential 
biosurfactant-producing bacteria from two sampling points in Kuantan Port seawater were successfully done. 
Amongst the isolates, 4 out of 7 isolates from Point A were Gram negative bacteria and 2 out 5 isolates from Point 
B were Gram negative bacteria. The positive oxidase test resulted for all isolates from Point A and only B5 from 
Point B produced negative result. Catalase test conducted produced positive results on isolates from Point A (A3, 
A5, A6& A7) and Point B (B1, B2, B4 & B5).The highest percentage emulsification index measured belonged to 
isolate B4 and B5 which are 67%, thus make these isolates to be the most promising biosurfactant producers. 
Further identification by 16S rRNA gene found that isolates were closely related to Rhodococcus erythropolis (A1), 
Psedomonas stutzeri (A2), Pseudoalteromonas lipolytica (A3, A6 and B4), Vibrio brasiliensis (A4 and B2), Vibrio 
tubiashii (B1), Marinobacter salsuginis (A5), Labrenzia aggregate (A7), Marinococcus halophilus (B3) and 
Thalassospira xianmenensis(B5). Hence, through biosurfactant activities exhibited by isolates, B4 and B5 were the 
most potential isolates to produce biosurfactant. Therefore, these isolates can potentially be exploited to aid in 
bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sites and would also be useful to enhance oil recovery in 
petroleum industry.",2018,
Science and Technology Studies Ã— Educational Studies: Critical and Creative Perspectives on the Future of STEM Education,"This special issue presents a collection of articles that multiplies Science and Technology Studies (STS) with Educational Studies, in an attempt to think differently about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. We hope this cross product of the two fields amplifies the philosophical insights from each, stretching scholarship in new directions and across disciplines. While diligently refusing reductive scientisms, we open up this manifold space so as to cultivate discussions of a possible rapprochement between the physical and social sciences (Wilson, 2015). This work responds to the changing theoretical landscape across the humanities or posthumanities, following the ontological turn and the shift to consider more-than-human agencies. This work is thus highly relevant for the field of educational studies and the social foundations of education, providing insights into alternative onto-epistemologies, and tracking the impact of these across education policy, research, and curriculum. As part of the shifting theoretical terrain, we see philosophers today exploring newmixtures of politics and nature by looking to mathematics (Badiou, 2011; Kirby, 2011; Meillassoux, 2010), the physical sciences (Bennett, 2010; Braidotti, 2013; Coole&Frost, 2010; DeLanda, 2011, 2015) as well as indigenous cosmologies (Avelar, 2013; Chakrabarty, 2009, 2014; Danowski & Viveiros",2017,Educational Studies
Race and Universality: Meillassoux Meets Eze and Wiredu,"This essay focuses on the tension between the need for a notion of universality that would abolish all concepts of race and the need to respect the violent history of races and the narratives and discourses that have been produced to this day in their name. In order to address this issue, this paper argues that the tension cannot be resolved or negotiated without a radical changeâ€”provoked by the work of Emmanuel Eze, Kwasi Wiredu and Quentin Meillassouxâ€”in the interpretation of universality. This radical change is brought on by a reformulation of the principle of non-contradiction, the only principle that can potentially sustain in harmony and therefore without tension both universality and race.",2019,

Extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics using a Krylov subspace approximation.,"It is shown how the electronic equations of motion in extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations [A. M. N. Niklasson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 123004 (2008); J. Chem. Phys. 147, 054103 (2017)] can be integrated using low-rank approximations of the inverse Jacobian kernel. This kernel determines the metric tensor in the harmonic oscillator extension of the Lagrangian that drives the evolution of the electronic degrees of freedom. The proposed kernel approximation is derived from a pseudoinverse of a low-rank estimate of the Jacobian, which is expressed in terms of a generalized set of directional derivatives with directions that are given from a Krylov subspace approximation. The approach allows a tunable and adaptive approximation that can take advantage of efficient preconditioning techniques. The proposed kernel approximation for the integration of the electronic equations of motion makes it possible to apply extended Lagrangian first-principles molecular dynamics simulations to a broader range of problems, including reactive chemical systems with numerically sensitive and unsteady charge solutions. This can be achieved without requiring exact full calculations of the inverse Jacobian kernel in each time step or relying on iterative non-linear self-consistent field optimization of the electronic ground state prior to the force evaluations as in regular direct Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics. The low-rank approximation of the Jacobian is directly related to Broyden's class of quasi-Newton algorithms and Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods and provides a complementary formulation for the solution of nonlinear systems of equations.",2020,The Journal of chemical physics

Applications of machine learning to agricultural land values: prediction and causal inference,"This dissertation focuses on the prediction of agricultural land values and the effects of water rights on land values using machine learning algorithms and hedonic pricing methods. I predict agricultural land values with different machine learning algorithms, including ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, random forests, and extreme gradient boosting methods. To analyze the causal effects of water right seniority on agricultural land values, I use the double-selection LASSO technique. The second chapter presents the data used in the dissertation. A unique set of parcel sales from Property Valuation Division of Kansas constitute the backbone of the data used in the estimation. Along with parcel sales data, I collected detailed basis, water, tax, soil, weather, and urban influence data. This chapter provides detailed explanation of various data sources and variable construction processes. The third chapter presents different machine learning models for irrigated agricultural land price predictions in Kansas. Researchers, and policymakers use different models and data sets for price prediction. Recently developed machine learning methods have the power to improve the predictive ability of the models estimated. In this chapter I estimate several machine learning models for predicting the agricultural land values in Kansas. Results indicate that the predictive power of the machine learning methods are stronger compared to standard econometric methods. Median absolute error in extreme gradient boosting estimation is 0.1312 whereas it is 0.6528 in simple OLS model. The fourth chapter examines whether water right seniority is capitalized into irrigated agricultural land values in Kansas. Using a unique data set of irrigated agricultural land sales, I analyze the causal effect of water right seniority on agricultural land values. A possible concern during the estimation of hedonic models is the omitted variable bias so we use doubleselection LASSO regression and its variable selection properties to overcome the omitted variable bias. I also estimate generalized additive models to analyze the nonlinearities that may exist. Results show that water rights have a positive impact on irrigated land prices in Kansas. An additional year of water right seniority causes irrigated land value to increase nearly $17 per acre. Further analysis also suggest a nonlinear relationship between seniority and agricultural land prices.

Magnet-Facilitated Selection of Electrogenic Bacteria from Marine Sediment,"Some bacteria can carry out anaerobic respiration by depositing electrons on external materials, such as electrodes, thereby creating an electrical current. Into the anode chamber of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) having abiotic air-cathodes we inoculated microorganisms cultured from a magnetic particle-enriched portion of a marine tidal sediment, reasoning that since some external electron acceptors are ferromagnetic, electrogenic bacteria should be found in their vicinity. Two MFCs, one inoculated with a mixed bacterial culture and the other with an axenic culture of a helical bacterium isolated from the magnetic particle enrichment, termed strain HJ, were operated for 65â€‰d. Both MFCs produced power, with production from the mixed culture MFC exceeding that of strain HJ. Strain HJ was identified as a Thalassospira sp. by transmission electron microscopic analysis and 16S rRNA gene comparisons. An MFC inoculated with strain HJ and operated in open circuit produced 47% and 57% of the maximal power produced from MFCs inoculated with the known electrogen Geobacter daltonii and the magnetotactic bacterium Desulfamplus magnetomortis, respectively. Further investigation will be needed to determine whether bacterial populations associated with magnetic particles within marine sediments are enriched for electrogens.",2015,BioMed Research International
Longitudinal survey in an endemic region of plasma soluble interleukin-2 receptor and antibody levels in Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"A survey involving 81 individuals living in Dafinso and VallÃ©e du Kou no. 4 (near Bobo-Dioulasso), Burkina Faso, was performed in June 1987, August to September 1987, and January 1988, respectively, at the beginning of, during, and after the transmission season of malaria. The clinical longitudinal study during the transmission period allowed us to define three different groups in terms of both age and occurrence of malaria attack (5,000 Plasmodium falciparum per mm3 of blood and axillary fever of greater than 37.7 degrees C) as follows: group 1, persons less than or equal to 15 years old who had at least one malaria attack during the transmission period; group 2, individuals less than or equal to 15 years old who did not have any malaria attacks; and group 3, individuals considered to be protected (adults greater than 15 years old with no malaria attacks). Soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels were found to be significantly increased (P less than 0.001) in the first two groups (1,047 +/- 481 U/ml [mean +/- standard deviation]) as compared with the adult group (605 +/- 307 U/ml). Considering all the groups, no significant difference was observed between observation periods. Levels of sIL-2R were inversely correlated (r = -0.39, n = 237, P less than 0.01) with age (range, 4 to 67 years). Negative correlations were also noticed between the levels of sIL-2R and those of antibodies to somatic antigen of P. falciparum (immunoglobulin G [IgG] class [r = -0.33, n = 237, P less than 0.01] and IgM class [r = -0.20, n = 237, P less than 0.05]). IgG antibody levels to somatic antigen were correlated with age, but IgM antibody levels to somatic antigen were not. The possible role played by sIL-2R in effector mechanisms against malaria is discussed.",1990,Journal of clinical microbiology
Ontology learning from text: Evaluation of learned ontologies,"Ontologies provide a structural organizational knowledge, they support the exchange and sharing of information. Moreover, one of the main benefits of using ontologies is the ability to infer new knowledge that allows the development of more realistic applications such as semantic search, automated reasoning, classification, query answering, among others. The need for overcoming the bottleneck, given in the knowledge acquisition by the manual construction of ontologies, has motivated studies on semi-automatic and automatic methods to build ontologies. One of the main sources of knowledge created by humans is given by text resources. The analysis and extraction of the elements of an ontology from texts is a very hard task. In particular, the acquisition of more expressive elements is our main goal. In this report we focus on present the experiments on four corpora and the evaluation made of the identified axiomatic relations (subClassOf, disjointWith, and equivalentClass). Also, we include the results compared with two related works showing prominent results. This report of activities corresponds to the fourth year of doctoral studies.",2013,
"Redescription of the Marine Nematode Pandolaimus latilaimus (AllgÃ©n, 1929), Its Synonyms and Relationships to the Oncholaimidae","Jensen, P. (Marine Biological Laboratory, University of Copenhagen, DK-3000 Helsingor, Denmark). Redescription of the marine nematode Pandolaimus latilaimus (Allgen, 1929), its synonyms and relationships to the Oncholaimidae. Zool. Scr. 5 (6): 257â€“263, 1976.â€”A redescription of Pandolaimus latilaimus (Allgen, 1929) from the North Sea (Belgian Coast and German Bight) and the Oresund (Denmark) is given. Pandolaimus Allgen, 1929 is synonymized with Allgenia Strand, 1934, Filipjeviella Allgen, 1935 and Metapelagonema Sergeeva, 1972. Pandolaimus latilaimus is considered synonymous with Allgenia kornoeensis (Allgen, 1929) and Filipjeviella liscosa Allgen, 1935. Pandolaimus is transferred from Lin-homoeidae (Monhysterida) to Anoplostomatidae (Enoplida). The genus is most closely related to Anophstoma Butschli, 1874 (cephalic sense organs 6 â€” 6 â€” 4, buccal cavity consisting of three plates, oesophageal glands opening behind the buccal cavity and caudal glands in front of the anus) and gives further evidence that the Anoplostomatidae have a position outside the Oncholaimoidea among the more basic Tripyloidea. â€”Thalassogenus Andrassy, 1973 described as member of Pelagonema-tidae from freshwater, does not belong to Oncholaimoidea.",1976,Zoologica Scripta
AnÃ¡lise paleopalinolÃ³gica do albiano na Bacia de Campos,"The present work was aimed to identify the marine and terrestrial palynomorphs from the Campos Basin and to analyze their distribution in geological sections in order to evaluate paleoenvironmental and paleobiogeographic models. The palynological material comes from the Bonito and Pampo wells, Albian, Macae Group. Gymnospermous pollen grains occur in considerable abundance, especially Classopolis classoides, Gnetaceapollenites spp. and Equisetosporites spp., which are typically xeromorphic. The most abundant dinoflagellates are the cosmopolitan species Spiniferites ramosus, Odontochitina operculata and Trichodinium castanea. Four typically Tethyan dinoflagellate species {Codoniella campanulata, Cyclonephelium vannophorum, Endoceratium dettmanniae and Tehamadinium mazaganense) were identified. The proportion of land-derived palynomorphs increases in the strata at the end of the Albian, concomitant with the transition from carbonates to shales and marls. Furthermore, marine palynomorphs increase in diversity from the base to the top of the studied sections, changing from a biota dominated by palynoforaminifera to one with high diversity and rich in dinoflagellates. Integration of the micropaleontological data indicates that, during the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean, the Campos Basin received water from the Tethys Ocean, which contradicts the classic model of Austral water incursion simultaneously with tectonic opening from south to north.",2015,
Stock Market Forecasting Using LASSO Linear Regression Model,"Predicting stock exchange rates is receiving increasing attention and is a vital financial problem as it contributes to the development of effective strategies for stock exchange transactions. The forecasting of stock price movement in general is considered to be a thought-provoking and essential task for financial time seriesâ€™ exploration. In this paper, a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method based on a linear regression model is proposed as a novel method to predict financial market behavior. LASSO method is able to produce sparse solutions and performs very well when the numbers of features are less as compared to the number of observations. Experiments were performed with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. stock to determine the efficiency of the model. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the ridge linear regression model.",2014,
Use of SNP genotypes to identify carriers of harmful recessive mutations in cattle populations,"BackgroundSNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) genotype data are increasingly available in cattle populations and, among other things, can be used to predict carriers of specific mutations. It is therefore convenient to have a practical statistical method for the accurate classification of individuals into carriers and non-carriers. In this paper, we compared â€“ through cross-validationâ€“ five classification models (Lasso-penalized logistic regression â€“Lasso, Support Vector Machines with either linear or radial kernel â€“SVML and SVMR, k-nearest neighbors â€“KNN, and multi-allelic gene prediction â€“MAG), for the identification of carriers of the TUBD1 recessive mutation on BTA19 (Bos taurus autosome 19), known to be associated with high calf mortality. A population of 3116 Fleckvieh and 392 Brown Swiss animals genotyped with the 54K SNP-chip was available for the analysis.ResultsIn general, the use of SNP genotypes proved to be very effective for the identification of mutation carriers. The best predictive models were Lasso, SVML and MAG, with an average error rate, respectively, of 0.2 %, 0.4 % and 0.6 % in Fleckvieh, and 1.2 %, 0.9 % and 1.7 % in Brown Swiss. For the three models, the false positive rate was, respectively, 0.1 %, 0.1 % and 0.2 % in Fleckvieh, and 3.0 %, 2.4 % and 1.6 % in Brown Swiss; the false negative rate was 4.4 %, 7.6 %1.0 % in Fleckvieh, and 0.0 %, 0.1% and 0.8 % in Brown Swiss. MAG appeared to be more robust to sample size reduction: with 25 % of the data, the average error rate was 0.7 % and 2.2 % in Fleckvieh and Brown Swiss, compared to 2.1 % and 5.5 % with Lasso, and 2.6 % and 12.0 % with SVML.ConclusionsThe use of SNP genotypes is a very effective and efficient technique for the identification of mutation carriers in cattle populations. Very few misclassifications were observed, overall and both in the carriers and non-carriers classes. This indicates that this is a very reliable approach for potential applications in cattle breeding.",2016,BMC Genomics
"The lasso-loop, lasso-mattress and simple-cinch stitch for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: are there biomechanical differences?","PurposeVarious stitching techniques have been described to facilitate arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears. The aim of the present study was to compare the biomechanical properties of the lasso-loop, lasso-mattress and simple-cinch stitch for rotator cuff repair.MethodsTwelve infraspinatus tendons were harvested from sheep and split in half. The tendons were randomized into three different stitch configuration groups for biomechanical testing: lasso-loop, lasso-mattress and simple-cinch stitch. Each specimen was first cyclically loaded on a universal materials testing machine under force control from 5 to 30Â N at 0.25Â Hz for twenty cycles. Then, each specimen was loaded to failure under displacement control at a rate of 1Â mm/s. Cyclic elongation, peak-to-peak displacement and ultimate tensile load were reported as meanÂ Â±Â standard error and compared using one way analysis of variance. The type of failure was recorded.ResultsNo differences in cyclic elongation (1.31Â Â±Â 0.09Â mm for the simple-cinch vs. 1.49Â Â±Â 0.07Â mm for the lasso-mattress vs. 1.61Â Â±Â 0.09Â mm for the lasso-loop stitch, pÂ =Â 0.063) or peak-to-peak displacement (0.58Â Â±Â 0.04Â mm for the simple-cinch, 0.50Â Â±Â 0.03Â mm for the lasso-mattress and 0.62Â Â±Â 0.06Â mm for the lasso-loop stitch, pÂ =Â 0.141) were seen between all tested stitch configurations. In the load-to-failure test, the simple cinch stitch (149.38Â Â±Â 11.89Â N) and the lasso-mattress (149.38Â Â±Â 10.33Â N) stitch demonstrated significantly higher ultimate load than the lasso-loop stitch (65.88Â Â±Â 4.75Â N, pÂ <Â 0.001). All stitch configurations failed with suture pull out.ConclusionsThe lasso-mattress and the simple-cinch stitch showed similar biomechanical properties with significant higher tensile loads needed for failure than the lasso-loop stitch.",2016,Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery
"Preemptive genotyping for personalized medicine: design of the right drug, right dose, right time-using genomic data to individualize treatment protocol.","OBJECTIVE
To report the design and implementation of the Right Drug, Right Dose, Right Time-Using Genomic Data to Individualize Treatment protocol that was developed to test the concept that prescribers can deliver genome-guided therapy at the point of care by using preemptive pharmacogenomics (PGx) data and clinical decision support (CDS) integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
We used a multivariate prediction model to identify patients with a high risk of initiating statin therapy within 3 years. The model was used to target a study cohort most likely to benefit from preemptive PGx testing among the Mayo Clinic Biobank participants, with a recruitment goal of 1000 patients. We used a Cox proportional hazards model with variables selected through the Lasso shrinkage method. An operational CDS model was adapted to implement PGx rules within the EMR.


RESULTS
The prediction model included age, sex, race, and 6 chronic diseases categorized by the Clinical Classifications Software for International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes (dyslipidemia, diabetes, peripheral atherosclerosis, disease of the blood-forming organs, coronary atherosclerosis and other heart diseases, and hypertension). Of the 2000 Biobank participants invited, 1013 (51%) provided blood samples, 256 (13%) declined participation, 555 (28%) did not respond, and 176 (9%) consented but did not provide a blood sample within the recruitment window (October 4, 2012, through March 20, 2013). Preemptive PGx testing included CYP2D6 genotyping and targeted sequencing of 84 PGx genes. Synchronous real-time CDS was integrated into the EMR and flagged potential patient-specific drug-gene interactions and provided therapeutic guidance.


CONCLUSION
This translational project provides an opportunity to begin to evaluate the impact of preemptive sequencing and EMR-driven genome-guided therapy. These interventions will improve understanding and implementation of genomic data in clinical practice.",2014,Mayo Clinic proceedings
An optimization approach to detect differentially methylated regions from Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing data,"Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is the current method of choice to obtain the methylation status of each single CpG dinucleotide in a genome. The typical analysis asks for regions that are differentially methylated (DMRs) between samples of two classes, such as different cell types. However, even with current low sequencing costs, many studies need to cope with few samples and medium coverage to stay within budget. We present a method to conservatively estimate the methylation difference between the two classes. Starting from a Bayesian paradigm, we formulate an optimization problem related to LASSO approaches. We present a dynamic programming approach to efficiently compute the optimal solution and its implementation diffmer. We discuss the dependency of the resulting DMRs on the free parameters of our approach and compare the results to those obtained by other DMR discovery tools (BSmooth and RADMeth). We showcase that our method discovers DMRs that are missed by the other tools.",2015,PeerJ PrePrints
The Situation of Widows: Do Sons and Brothers Help?,"The situation of widows in India has received relatively little research attention compared to other gender issues (Mohindra et al., 2012). However, the subject is an important one, given that women outlive men in most countries, including India, and also because females marry at a younger age, therefore increasing the time they spend in a widowed state. Women are less likely to remarry, their employment opportunities are fewer, their wages are lower, and they are less likely to inherit land. The lone widow may be forced by the loss of her husbandâ€™s earnings to sell her land or other assets in order to survive. Thus, widows require more old age support than widowed men, and their need for sons as insurance against adversity may also be greater (Vlassoff, 1990b).",2013,
NELasso: Group-Sparse Modeling for Characterizing Relations Among Named Entities in News Articles,"Named entities such as people, locations, and organizations play a vital role in characterizing online content. They often reflect information of interest and are frequently used in search queries. Although named entities can be detected reliably from textual content, extracting relations among them is more challenging, yet useful in various applications (e.g., news recommending systems). In this paper, we present a novel model and system for learning semantic relations among named entities from collections of news articles. We model each named entity occurrence with sparse structured logistic regression, and consider the words (predictors) to be grouped based on background semantics. This sparse group LASSO approach forces the weights of word groups that do not influence the prediction towards zero. The resulting sparse structure is utilized for defining the type and strength of relations. Our unsupervised system yields a named entitiesâ€™ network where each relation is typed, quantified, and characterized in context. These relations are the key to understanding news material over time and customizing newsfeeds for readers. Extensive evaluation of our system on articles from TIME magazine and BBC News shows that the learned relations correlate with static semantic relatedness measures like WLM, and capture the evolving relationships among named entities over time.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
