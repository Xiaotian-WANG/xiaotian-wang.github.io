The Adaptive Lasso and Its Oracle Properties,"The lasso is a popular technique for simultaneous estimation and variable selection. Lasso variable selection has been shown to be consistent under certain conditions. In this work we derive a necessary condition for the lasso variable selection to be consistent. Consequently, there exist certain scenarios where the lasso is inconsistent for variable selection. We then propose a new version of the lasso, called the adaptive lasso, where adaptive weights are used for penalizing different coefficients in the 1 penalty. We show that the adaptive lasso enjoys the oracle properties; namely, it performs as well as if the true underlying model were given in advance. Similar to the lasso, the adaptive lasso is shown to be near-minimax optimal. Furthermore, the adaptive lasso can be solved by the same efficient algorithm for solving the lasso. We also discuss the extension of the adaptive lasso in generalized linear models and show that the oracle properties still hold under mild regularity conditions. As a byproduct of our theory, the nonnegative garotte is shown to be consistent for variable selection.",2006,
La Cryptococcose Neuro-meningee Au Cours Du Sida : Etude Preliminaire a L'hopital De Bobo-dioulasso (burkina Faso),"Aids-related cryptococcus neoformans meningitis : preliminary study at Bobo-Dioulasso National Hospital (Burkina Faso) A re t rospective study of impatients hospitalized from mar c h 1993 to march 1995 found that seven patients with AIDS related Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis were admitted at the Internal Medicine clinic of Bobo-Dioulasso Hospital (Burkina-Faso). Five men and two women had C. neoformans meningitis (India ink stain/culture of cerebrospinal fluid). Six patients were HIV seropositives (ELISA-Genelavia) and two w e re HIV 1 (Western-Blot). Diarrhoea, cough, amebic liver abcess, typhoid fever and tuberculous adenitis preceded the o c c u rence of Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis in six patients. Cryptococcosis was inaugural of AIDS in one case. These cases re p resent 3,25 % of the seropositives admitted during the study period and 20,5 % of those who had CSF examination for C. neoformans. Headache (7,/), mental disorders (6/7) and vomiting (5/7) were the main pr e s e n t i n g symptoms. Nuchal rigidity and Kernigâ€™s sign were found in less than half the cases. CSF was always clear and lymphocytic. No major pleocytosis dans albuminorachy was found in most cases by glucose was frankly low in five cases. India ink smear showed C neoformans in six cases and CSF culture was positive in five cases. Isolates were always sensible to Amphotericin B and sensible to Ketoconazole and 5 flucytosine in three out of five cases. Neurologic complic-ations and associated opportunistic condition account for the high m o rtality and short time fo survival (mean 42,5 days). Six patients died and one was lost to follow-up. This study establishe the emergence of AIDS-related cryptococcal disease in Bobo-Dioulasso. Presentation is consistent with advance i m m u n o d e p ression. India ink smear of CSF should be more systematically performed.",1996,
Estimation and Clustering in Statistical Ill-posed Linear Inverse Problems,"The main focus of the dissertation is estimation and clustering in statistical ill-posed linear inverse problems. The dissertation deals with a problem of simultaneously estimating a collection of solutions of ill-posed linear inverse problems from their noisy images under an operator that does not have a bounded inverse, when the solutions are related in a certain way. The dissertation defense consists of three parts. In the first part, the collection consists of measurements of temporal functions at various spatial locations. In particular, we study the problem of estimating a three-dimensional function based on observations of its noisy Laplace convolution. In the second part, we recover classes of similar curves when the class memberships are unknown. Problems of this kind appear in many areas of application where clustering is carried out at the pre-processing step and then the inverse problem is solved for each of the cluster averages separately. As a result, the errors of the procedures are usually examined for the estimation step only. In both parts, we construct the estimators, study their minimax optimality and evaluate their performance via a limited simulation study. In the third part, we propose a new computational platform to better understand the patterns of R-fMRI by taking into account the challenge of inevitable signal fluctuations and interpret the success of dynamic functional connectivity approaches. Towards this, we revisit an auto-regressive and vector auto-regressive signal modeling approach for estimating temporal changes of the signal in brain regions. We then generate inverse covariance matrices from the generated windows and use a non-parametric statistical approach to select significant features. Finally, we use Lasso to perform classification of the data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evidenced in the classification of R-fMRI scans.",2019,
Enforcement : Evidence from Two Field Experiments â‡¤,"Effective dispute resolution is important for reducing private and social costs. This paper studies the effects of price differences and communication style on copyright infringement settlement. We use a novel dataset of infringement incidences by businesses generated from two field experiments run by a stock-photography agency. We find that a substantial reduction in the requested amount generates a small increase in settlement rate; given the same reduced request, a message informing infringers of the price reduction and acknowledging possible unintentionality generates a large increase; and including a deadline further increases the response. The small price effect (when compared to the large message effect) can be explained as the result of two effects that counteract each other: price inducement to settle early, but a lower threat of escalation. Furthermore, acknowledging possible unintentionality may encourage collaborative behavior due to the typically inadvertent nature of these incidences. The resulting higher settlement rate avoids additional legal action and reduces social costs. â‡¤The authors thank James Dana, Alberto Galasso, Shane Greenstein, Michael Grubb, William Hickman, GastÃ³n Llanes, Mike Luca, Cynthia Montgomery, Felix Oberholzer-Gee, Jason Snyder, Scott Stern, Ricardo Perez-Truglia, Dennis Yao and seminar participants at the Canadian Conference on the Economics of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Harvard Business School, MIT Sloan, Microsoft Research, NBER Economics of Digitization Conference, NBER Productivity Lunch, and the Strategic Research Forum for helpful comments.

"MAGIC: a general, powerful and tractable method for selective inference","Selective inference is a recent research topic that tries to perform valid inference after using the data to select a reasonable statistical model. We propose MAGIC, a new method for selective inference that is general, powerful and tractable. MAGIC is a method for selective inference after solving a convex optimization problem with smooth loss and $\ell_1$ penalty. Randomization is incorporated into the optimization problem to boost statistical power. Through reparametrization, MAGIC reduces the problem into a sampling problem with simple constraints. MAGIC applies to many $\ell_1$ penalized optimization problem including the Lasso, logistic Lasso and neighborhood selection in graphical models, all of which we consider in this paper.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Feature Selection for Data Integration with Mixed Multi-view Data.,"Data integration methods that analyze multiple sources of data simultaneously can often provide more holistic insights than can separate inquiries of each data source. Motivated by the advantages of data integration in the era of ""big data"", we investigate feature selection for high-dimensional multi-view data with mixed data types (e.g. continuous, binary, count-valued). This heterogeneity of multi-view data poses numerous challenges for existing feature selection methods. However, after critically examining these issues through empirical and theoretically-guided lenses, we develop a practical solution, the Block Randomized Adaptive Iterative Lasso (B-RAIL), which combines the strengths of the randomized Lasso, adaptive weighting schemes, and stability selection. B-RAIL serves as a versatile data integration method for sparse regression and graph selection, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of B-RAIL through extensive simulations and a case study to infer the ovarian cancer gene regulatory network. In this case study, B-RAIL successfully identifies well-known biomarkers associated with ovarian cancer and hints at novel candidates for future ovarian cancer research.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Logistic regression and Ising networks: prediction and estimation when violating lasso assumptions,"The Ising model was originally developed to model magnetisation of solids in statistical physics. As a network of binary variables with the probability of becoming â€™activeâ€™ depending only on direct neighbours, the Ising model appears appropriate for many other processes. For instance, it was recently applied in psychology to model co-occurrences of mental disorders. It has been shown that the connections between the variables (nodes) in the Ising network can be estimated with a series of logistic regressions. This naturally leads to questions of how well such a model predicts new observations and how well parameters of the Ising model can be estimated using logistic regressions. Here we focus on the high-dimensional setting with more parameters than observations and consider violations of assumptions of the lasso. In particular, we determine the consequences for both prediction and estimation when the sparsity and restricted eigenvalue assumptions are not satisfied. We explain using the idea of connected copies (extreme multicollinearity) the fact that prediction becomes better when either sparsity or multicollinearity is not satisfied. We illustrate these results with simulations.",2018,
Granger Causality in Multivariate Time Series Using a Time-Ordered Restricted Vector Autoregressive Model,"Granger causality has been used for the investigation of the inter-dependence structure of the underlying systems of multivariate time series. In particular, the direct causal effects are commonly estimated by the conditional Granger causality index (CGCI). In the presence of many observed variables and relatively short time series, CGCI may fail because it is based on vector autoregressive models (VAR) involving a large number of coefficients to be estimated. In this paper, the VAR is restricted by a scheme that modifies the recently developed method of backward-in-time selection (BTS) of the lagged variables and the CGCI is combined with BTS. Further, the proposed approach is compared favorably to other restricted VAR representations, such as the top-down strategy, the bottom-up strategy, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), in terms of sensitivity and specificity of CGCI. This is shown by using simulations of linear and nonlinear, low- and high-dimensional systems and different time series lengths. For nonlinear systems, CGCI from the restricted VAR representations are compared with analogous nonlinear causality indices. Further, CGCI in conjunction with BTS and other restricted VAR representations is applied to multichannel scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of epileptic patients containing epileptiform discharges. CGCI on the restricted VAR, and BTS in particular, could track the changes in brain connectivity before, during and after epileptiform discharges, which was not possible using the full VAR representation.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
"Metasomatic origin of augen gneisses and related mylonitic rocks in the hida metamorphic complex, central Japan","SummaryThe augen gneisses exposed in the Katakai area, in the north-eastern part of the Hida metamorphic complex, central Japan, are highly metasomatized sheared rocks. They contain K-feldspar megacrysts of nearly maximum ordering, and occur in a narrow zone, 2â€“3 km wide and 20â€“25 km long, along the boundary between hornblende gneiss and early Mesozoic granites. The hornblende gneiss, the protolith of augen gneisses, is mylonitized toward the granite, accompanied by significant metasomatism under greenschist facies conditions. The enrichment of SiO2 and K2O, and the increase of modal quartz, K-feldspar and hydrous minerals, are well described in terms of the Ml-value [Mylonitization Index: the modal fraction of fine-grained matrix (< 0.2 mm) representing the amount of grain-size reduction in thin section]. The primary plagioclase was albitized and the essential mineral assemblages were changed from oligoclase + hornblende in the protolith to actinolite + chlorite + epidote, and then, into epidote + biotite, along with the increase in MI-value. The mineralogical changes and growth of low microcline were carried out by reaction with and precipitation from fluids which flowed from the granite into the country rocks under shearing.ZusammenfassungDie im Katakai-Gebiet im Nordostteil des metamorphen Komplexes von Hida, ZentralJapan, auftretenden Augengneise sind intensiv metasomatisierte, zerscherte Gesteine.

Cervico-mediastinal thymic cyst: cyst puncture and contrast radiographic demonstration.,"Positive contrast demonstration of a cervical or cervico-mediastinal thymic cyst has not been previously reported. The following is an account of the findings of a cyst puncture and water soluble positive contrast demonstration of the more rare cervico-mediastinal thymic cyst. A six-year-old boy presented to surgical out-patients because of an asymptomatic swelling on the right side of his neck. This swelling only became apparent when he strained or performed the Valsalva manoeuvre. There was a history of the boy being lassooed about the neck and being pulled from his bicycle nine months before. His mother noticed the swelling two weeks after this episode when he coughed or became excited. There was no change in his general good health. The swelling had not changed in size, but the patient had become more adept at demonstrating it. The lump was apparent only when intra-thoracic pressure was raised. It then appeared from behind the right clavicular notch of the manubrium sterni and extended almost up to th...",1977,The British journal of radiology
A novel approach to estimate the Cox model with temporal covariates and its application to medical cost data,"We propose a novel approach to estimate the Cox model with temporal covariates. Our new approach treats the temporal covariates as arising from a longitudinal process which is modeled jointly with the event time. Different from the literature, the longitudinal process in our model is specified as a bounded variational process and determined by a family of Initial Value Problems associated with an Ordinary Differential Equation. Our specification has the advantage that only the observation of the temporal covariates at the time to event and the time to event itself are required to fit the model, while it is fine but not necessary to have more longitudinal observations. This fact makes our approach very useful for many medical outcome datasets, like the New York State Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System and the National Inpatient Sample, where it is important to find the hazard rate of being discharged given the accumulative cost but only the total cost at the discharge time is available due to the protection of patient information. Our estimation procedure is based on maximizing the full information likelihood function. The resulting estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Variable selection techniques, like Adaptive LASSO, can be easily modified and incorporated into our estimation procedure. The oracle property is verified for the resulting estimator of the regression coefficients. Simulations and a real example illustrate the practical utility of the proposed model. Finally, a couple of potential extensions of our approach are discussed.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Recruitment of blood donors in Burkina Faso: how to avoid donations from family members?,"Burkina Faso is a continental West African country of approximately 16 M people whose transfusion needs were covered by 66,210 blood units collected mostly in 4 regional transfusion centers part of a national network but also from hospital-based smaller blood centers. The first group of blood centers relies almost exclusively on volunteer, non-remunerated, blood donors and only approximately 32.7% of them are repeating donation. In contrast, hospital-based blood centers rely nearly exclusively on family/replacement donors. The general strategy of the national blood transfusion network was to base the system exclusively on volunteer donors, which was nearly accomplished overall and completely at Bobo-Dioulasso, the largest center. However, despite considerable increase in blood collection, the overall blood supply remains low (4.7 units/1000 inhabitants) and worsens during the secondary school recesses since young student blood constitutes the most part of volunteer donors. To overcome such shortages, mobile blood collection sessions are organized in alternate sites such as military barracks or places of worship but with limited success. Another critical issue is that despite considerable efforts and help from community advocates, only 32.7% of volunteers repeat donation limiting the considerably safety advantage of a pool of regular donors.",2010,Biologicals : journal of the International Association of Biological Standardization
"Dynamic Comovement among Banks, Systemic Risk, and the Macroeconomy","This paper develops a new measure of comovement in the banking sector that takes into account the dynamic nature of interlinkages among different bank holding corporations at different stages of business cycles. For this purpose, we use a dynamic factor model with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility that decomposes the panel data for the return on assets (ROA) and net chargeoffs (NCO) into a common component and an institution-specific idiosyncratic components. We find that the relative contribution of the common factor in explaining the variation in ROA and NCO peaked during the financial crisis, suggesting a significant increase in systemic stress in the banking sector. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach, we show that the estimated common components and their stochastic volatilities from our approach perform well when compared to other widely used measures of systemic risk in explaining real economic activity. Furthermore, we find that these measures have better in-sample fit with real economic activity measures than the industry averages of ROA and NCO that are frequently used in the banking literature. Finally, we provide economic interpretation for the idiosyncratic components as banking balance sheet characteristics.",2017,
The East Asian 'Mediterranean': a medium of flourishing exchange relations and interaction in the East Asian world,"The Sea brings together a group of noted contributors to evaluate the different ways in which seas have served as subjects in historiography and asks how this has changed---and will change---the way history is written. The essays in this volume provide exemplary demonstrations of how a sea-based history-writing that focuses on connectivity, networks, and individuals describes the horizons and the potential of thalassography---the study of the world made by individuals embedded in networks of motion. As Peter N. Miller contends in his introduction, writing about the sea, today, is a way of partaking in the wider historiographical shift toward microhistory; exchange relations; networks; and, above all, materiality, both literally and figuratively. The Sea focuses not on questions of discipline and professionalization as much as on the practice of scholarship: the writing, and therefore the planning and organizing, of histories of the sea.",2012,
Avant-garde assembly-line biosynthesis expands diversity of cyclic lipodepsipeptide products,"Modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymatic assembly lines are large and dynamic protein machines that generally undergo a linear progression of catalytic cycles via a series of enzymatic domains organized into independent modules. Here we report the heterologous reconstitution and comprehensive characterization of two hybrid NRPS-PKS assembly lines that defy many standard rules of assembly-line biosynthesis to generate a large combinatorial library of cyclic lipodepsipeptide protease inhibitors called thalassospiramides. We generate a series of precise domain-inactivating mutations in thalassospiramide assembly lines and present compelling evidence for an unprecedented biosynthetic model that invokes inter-module substrate activation and tailoring, module skipping, and pass-back chain extension, whereby the ability to pass the growing chain back to a preceding module is flexible and substrate-driven. Expanding bidirectional inter-module domain interactions could represent a viable mechanism for generating chemical diversity without increasing the size of biosynthetic assembly lines and raises new questions regarding our understanding of the structural features of multi-modular megaenzymes.",2019,bioRxiv
Estimating stellar atmospheric parameters based on Lasso features,"With the rapid development of large scale sky surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), GAIA and LAMOST (Guoshoujing telescope), stellar spectra can be obtained on an ever-increasing scale. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate stellar atmospheric parameters such as Teff, log g and [Fe/H] automatically to achieve the scientific goals and make full use of the potential value of these observations. Feature selection plays a key role in the automatic measurement of atmospheric parameters. We propose to use the least absolute shrinkage selection operator (Lasso) algorithm to select features from stellar spectra. Feature selection can reduce redundancy in spectra, alleviate the influence of noise, improve calculation speed and enhance the robustness of the estimation system. Based on the extracted features, stellar atmospheric parameters are estimated by the support vector regression model. Three typical schemes are evaluated on spectral data from both the ELODIE library and SDSS. Experimental results show the potential performance to a certain degree. In addition, results show that our method is stable when applied to different spectra.",2014,Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics
A Robust Framework For Eigenspace Image Reconstruction,"Principal components analysis (PCA) has been proved to be a useful tool for many computer vision and signal processing problems. One drawback of traditional PCA is that they are based on least squares estimation techniques and hence fail to account for â€œoutliersâ€ which are commonly occurred in realistic training sets. To make PCA more robust to real-world problems such as image reconstruction addressed in this paper, we develop a two-step algorithm that can eliminate the outliers on both frame level and pixel level through the LASSO and RPCA separately. With LASSO optimization method, we may obtain sparse projected coefficients of the original image into the basis image space. According to the sparsity of these coefficients, sample outliers can be recognized automatically. Then, with the use of robust M-estimation, the influence of intra-sample outliers may be overwhelmed to great extent. Additionally, due to orthogonality of the principal components, the soft-threshold estimation can be applied to the LASSO to alleviate the computational costs, hence make our robust PCA method more applicable to large scale problems. An experiment on object image reconstruction is used to illustrate the advantage of our proposed technique over standard PCA.",2005,
Abstract 1955: LIN28 paralogs impact ovarian cancer predisposition and tumorigenicity via distinct molecular pathways.,"Proceedings: AACR 104th Annual Meeting 2013; Apr 6-10, 2013; Washington, DC

The RNA binding protein LIN28 and its paralog LIN28B function at a critical junction of pleuripotency, metabolism and metastasis. Reactivation of LIN28 has been recently reported in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), where it is hypothesized to play a key role in maintaining tumor stem cells. Associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms in the LIN28B promoter and ovarian cancer susceptibility have also been identified. However, the clinical significance of these observations and the mechanisms by which either LIN28 gene contributes to ovarian cancer have not been explored.

Using Western blot, qPCR and immunohistochemistry, we found that a) LIN28 but not LIN28B is highly expressed in epithelia lining the distal fallopian tube and b) reactivation of LIN28 (1/8 specimens) and dysregulated expression of LIN28B (4/8 specimens) occur in EOC. To assess clinical significance of these events, we interrogated the TCGA ovarian cancer database, examining correlations between LIN28, LIN28B expression and outcomes by Kaplan-Meier analysis (n=581). Our results indicate that LIN28 expression is associated with shorter disease free interval in women with optimally debulked high grade serous ovarian cancers (p<0.05). Significantly higher levels of LIN28B were also noted in young (age <50) women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Using serial logistic regression with L1 normalization (Lasso analysis), we discovered LIN28 levels correlated most robustly with multiple genes rather than miRNAs: APOC3 (Î² =0.74), FGG (Î² =0.69), HBG1(Î²=0.67) and HEMGN (Î² =0.67). Although associations between LIN28 and miRNAs predicted by current models were not observed, robust correlations between LIN28B and multiple miRNAs were detected: let-7b (Î² =-0.47), let-7d (Î² =-0.34), let-7i (Î² =-0.31) as well as others [miR-222 (Î²=-0.29), let-7e, miR-222, miR-324-5p] not previously known to be regulated by either LIN28 gene. Lastly, we found that expression of LIN28B but not LIN28 was induced by culturing A2780 and TOV112D ovarian cancer cells in media that promotes self-assembly into spheroids. Knockdown of LIN28B expression confirms that LIN28B directly regulates the let-7 and other miRNAs identified by our analyses, promotes spheroid assembly and in vivo tumorigenicity of ovarian cancer cell lines.

Collectively, these observations indicate that LIN28 likely plays an important role in regenerating epithelia that normally line the distal fallopian tube. Although our data also suggest that reactivation of LIN28 plays a key role in promoting ovarian cancer recurrences, LIN28 does not contribute to this process by targeting the differentiation of pluripotent cells via a let-7-mediated mechanism. Rather, this role appears to be most robust for its paralog LIN28B. Future work will focus on further dissecting the unique roles of these two gene products in ovarian cancer initiation and metastasis as well as their response to treatment.

Measuring Granger Causality between Cortical Regions from Voxelwise fMRI BOLD Signals with LASSO,"Functional brain network studies using the Blood Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) signal from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) are becoming increasingly prevalent in research on the neural basis of human cognition. An important problem in functional brain network analysis is to understand directed functional interactions between brain regions during cognitive performance. This problem has important implications for understanding top-down influences from frontal and parietal control regions to visual occipital cortex in visuospatial attention, the goal motivating the present study. A common approach to measuring directed functional interactions between two brain regions is to first create nodal signals by averaging the BOLD signals of all the voxels in each region, and to then measure directed functional interactions between the nodal signals. Another approach, that avoids averaging, is to measure directed functional interactions between all pairwise combinations of voxels in the two regions. Here we employ an alternative approach that avoids the drawbacks of both averaging and pairwise voxel measures. In this approach, we first use the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO) to pre-select voxels for analysis, then compute a Multivariate Vector AutoRegressive (MVAR) model from the time series of the selected voxels, and finally compute summary Granger Causality (GC) statistics from the model to represent directed interregional interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on both simulated and empirical fMRI data. We also show that averaging regional BOLD activity to create a nodal signal may lead to biased GC estimation of directed interregional interactions. The approach presented here makes it feasible to compute GC between brain regions without the need for averaging. Our results suggest that in the analysis of functional brain networks, careful consideration must be given to the way that network nodes and edges are defined because those definitions may have important implications for the validity of the analysis.",2012,PLoS Computational Biology
Rank-based estimation in the {ell}1-regularized partly linear model for censored outcomes with application to integrated analyses of clinical predictors and gene expression data.,"We consider estimation and variable selection in the partial linear model for censored data. The partial linear model for censored data is a direct extension of the accelerated failure time model, the latter of which is a very important alternative model to the proportional hazards model. We extend rank-based lasso-type estimators to a model that may contain nonlinear effects. Variable selection in such partial linear model has direct application to high-dimensional survival analyses that attempt to adjust for clinical predictors. In the microarray setting, previous methods can adjust for other clinical predictors by assuming that clinical and gene expression data enter the model linearly in the same fashion. Here, we select important variables after adjusting for prognostic clinical variables but the clinical effects are assumed nonlinear. Our estimator is based on stratification and can be extended naturally to account for multiple nonlinear effects. We illustrate the utility of our method through simulation studies and application to the Wisconsin prognostic breast cancer data set.",2009,Biostatistics
Changes in a moth community mediated by biological control of the dominant species,"After biological control of the mango shoot caterpillar, Penicillaria jocosatrix Guenee (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), on Guam, populations of four other species of Lepidoptera using mango increased. These included three species of Geometridaeâ€”the widespread Anisodes illepidaria Guenee, Thalassodes sp., and Chloroclystis sp.â€”and the noctuid Nanaguna breviuscula Walker. Thalassodes sp., Chloroclystis sp., and N. breviuscula were most commonly found on mango inflorescences, and probably became more abundant as a result of an increase in mango flowers. A. illepidaria caterpillars, which eat leaves and flowers, increased l0-fold after suppression of P. jocosatrix . Comparison of its larval biology with the mango shoot caterpillar showed that A. illepidaria preferred slightly older, developing leaves. Survival of A. illepidaria was low on very young leaves, which were highly suitable for P. jocosatrix . Introduced biological control agents acted as keystone predators, preventing the mango shoot caterpillar from preempting mango as a resource for the other Lepidoptera species.",1992,Environmental Entomology

Bacterial enzymes in thymidylate synthesis,"Deoxyribonucletides (dNTPs) are synthesized via the de novo and salvage pathways. The de novo synthesis involves initial synthesis of ribonucleotides whereas the salvage pathway uses deoxyribonucleosides. Deoxynucleoside kinases (dNKs) initiate the salvage pathway and this step is often considered as rate limiting. The two pathways eventually coincide to one where nucleoside monophosphate kinases are the shared enzymes. In this thesis two thymidine kinases (TKs) and a thymidylate kinase (TMPK) are cloned, expressed and characterized and they originate from Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu) and Bacillus anthracis (Ba). Uu causes urethritis and is associated with complications in pregnancy, e.g. premature births, infertility, spontaneous abortions and chronic lung disease in the infants. Ba causes anthrax; cutaneous, inhalational and gastrointestinal, where the two latter have a high mortality rate. Ba is also considered as a potent bioweapon because of its spore forming ability. TK from Uu (Uu-TK) was strictly pyrimidine specific and used all nucleoside triphosphates as phosphate donors, except dTTP that was a feedback inhibitor. Further studies discovered that analogs with halogen substitutions at the 5-position gave the highest activity. Analogs with modifications at the N3- or 3â€™-position showed good to moderate activities while 2â€™-substituents were not substrates. A fluorine substitution was tolerated in the 2â€™-arabinosyl position. These results correlated well with the active site structure of Uu-TK. The Uu-TK structure contained a unique domain, the lasso domain with a structural zinc ion, and belonged structurally to another enzyme family than the other dNKs. TK and TMPK from Ba (Ba-TK and Ba-TMPK) were strictly pyrimidine and thymidylate specific, respectively. Ba-TK used all nucleoside triphosphates as phosphate donors, except dTTP, and phosphorylated several nucleoside analogs. The analog activities of Ba-TK were similar to that of Uu-TK. Ba-TMPK used ATP and dATP as phosphate donors and a number of analogs as substrates. FMAUMP (1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-methyluracil-5â€™-monophosphate) was the best substrate and its nucleoside form was a potent inhibitor. Enzymes in thymidylate synthesis are potential targets for antibacterial therapy and the studies conducted in this thesis have discovered several potential leads, which will contribute to future design of antibiotics.",2006,
California Multi-Hazard Physical Vulnerability Prioritization of School Infrastructure in the Philippines,"The Philippines is one of the most hazard-prone countries in the world. It is regularly subjected to various hazard events, imposing loss of lives and costly damage to the countryâ€™s infrastructure. In particular, the Philippines straddles a region of complex tectonics at the intersection of three major tectonic plates (the Philippine Sea, Sunda and Eurasia plates). As such, the country is frequently exposed to large and damaging earthquakes. For instance, one of the most recent destructive earthquakes, the M 7.2 Bohol and Cebu earthquake (2013), damaged more than 73,000 structures, of which more than 14,500 were totally destroyed, including several schools. According to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), about 25,000 preschoolers and 275,855 school children in 1,200 early learning centers and 1,092 schools (931 elementary schools and 161 high schools) were affected by the earthquake. Similarly, several areas characterized by high wind and heavy rain exist along the northeast Philippine Sea coast. In 1991, a flash flood killed around 8,000 people and distracted many structure in Leyte Island. Furthermore, Typhoon Haiyan (2013), known as Super Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, has been one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded, which devastated several portions of the country, killing at least 6,300 people. According to the Philippineâ€™s Department of Education (DepEd), Yolanda damaged 3,171 schools. The recent history of reported damage and destruction indicates the substantial vulnerability of the countryâ€™s infrastructure, particularly schools, to different forms of natural hazards. Schools play a critical role in the education of a communityâ€™s next generation and one of the most vulnerable components of the society due to their age and their developmental stage. A safer and resilient school can save valuable lives of children, provide a safe haven for the local community, serving as a temporary shelter and helping to bring normalcy back to society in times of disaster. 1 PhD Candidate, EPICentre, University College London, United Kingdom (email: a.nassirpour@ucl.ac.uk) 2 Senior Lecturer, EPICentre, University College London, United Kingdom (email: c.galasso@ucl.ac.uk) 3 Professor, EPICentre, University College London, United Kingdom (email: d.dayala@ucl.ac.uk) Nassirpour A, Galasso C, Dâ€™Ayala D. Multi-Hazard Physical Vulnerability Prioritization of School Infrastructure in the Philippines. Proceedings of the 11 National Conference in Earthquake Engineering, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA. 2018. However, like other infrastructure, public school buildings constructed prior to adequate building codes, share structural deficiencies common to other buildings of the same structural types in the same setting, but the above considerations set school buildings apart from their peers in terms of priority for assessment and retrofit. Taking into consideration the high probability of occurrence for any type of natural hazard in the Philippines, assessing multi-hazard vulnerability of school buildings is an urgent task for the governmental authorities and first responders. Given the large number of existing school sites and their geographical distribution, appropriate and effective tools and approaches are required to address the prevailing physical and social vulnerabilities of Philippineâ€™s school infrastructure to multiple natural hazards. Specifically, developing a comprehensive dataset of typical and systematically defined structural typologies for schools, including main structural and non-structural characteristics (e.g., age of construction, number of story, lateral load resisting system and materials, number of occupants), common defects, typical damage associated to multiple natural hazards, is beneficial for disaster management planning and decision making along with prioritization and resource allocation for retrofitting/strengthening plans for such structures. This paper introduces a series of tools for a rapid yet reliable visual multi-hazard vulnerability prioritization of school infrastructure against potentially destructive natural hazards, i.e., earthquake, typhoon, and flood. To this aim, a rapid visual survey form is developed first and implemented in a mobile application to efficiently assist the surveyors. An illustrative application of the developed tools is presented for the city of Cagayan de Oro, Philippines, relating the collected data to vulnerability indices to swiftly determine the safety level of the considered buildings. Cagayan de Oro is the regional capital and the gateway to Northern Mindanao. It is a highly urbanized first-class city with over 602,000 citizens and multi-hazard profile of earthquakes, floods, cyclones, tsunami, among others. To test the applicability of the proposed tools to Cagayan de Oro, 115 school buildings have been surveyed and their vulnerability indices have been estimated. The proposed tools represent a first step toward a detailed multi-hazard vulnerability assessment framework of school infrastructure. The aim is to allow stakeholders and decision-makers to quickly identify the most vulnerable structures among the surveyed stock, to guide more detailed data collection campaigns and structural assessment procedures (e.g., analytical vulnerability approaches, through fragility and vulnerability relationships), and ultimately to plan further retrofitting/strengthening measures or, if necessary, school replacement/relocation.

Using EEG to Predict and Analyze Password Memorability,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have given us insight into the human brain, and as sensors grow cheaper and smaller, and devices get more connected, more researchers from new domains are motivated to use BCIs. In this 19-participant lab study, we use off-the-shelf BCIs to investigate password memorability and recall. We record electroencephalogram (EEG) potentials collected by BCIs upon presenting passwords of different characteristics to participants while asking them to memorize these passwords, and then recall them. Features from the EEG signals are extracted in three domains: power spectrum from the frequency domain, statistics from the time domain, and wavelet coefficients from the time-frequency domain. Lasso feature selection method is used, and the selected parameters and feature subsets are submitted for classification with two classes, recalled and not recalled, based on the user's subsequent recall of the passwords. Results show discriminating features of EEG signals in the two different classes, achieving a classification accuracy of 88%. Our results indicate that it may be possible to predict subsequent password recall based on EEG activity during password presentation.",2019,2019 IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC)
Discovering Sparse and Ununiform Lag Structure Using VAR Models with Latent Group LASSO,"Structurally regularized learning methods have been attracting attention in the field of statistics, machine learning, and signal processing as useful analysis tools for learning in high-dimensional settings. Using these methods, specific structure can be represented in parameters. In multivariate time series data, it is important to capture time-delay structure where necessary lag length to explain each variable is different. In this paper, we deal with a problem to discover the optimal number of order for each variable in VAR models. When we apply conventional structurally regularized learning methods such as Group Lasso, some problems, which include loss of necessary coefficients, occur. To overcome these problems, we propose a method based on the Latent Group LASSO regularization. To apply it to VAR models, we introduce overlapped coefficient groups in time direction and use a heavy-tailed distribution, such as Student's t-distribution, as a prior to enhance its sparsity. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method using artificial data and actual data set (Beijing PM2.5 data set). As the result, we obtained the sparse models that capture ununiform time-delay structure represented by fewer variables with the same degree of forecast accuracy comparing with ordinary VAR models.",2019,2019 International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)
The Group Square-Root Lasso: Theoretical Properties and Fast Algorithms,"We introduce and study the group square-root lasso (GSRL) method for estimation in high dimensional sparse regression models with group structure. The new estimator minimizes the square root of the residual sum of squares plus a penalty term proportional to the sum of the Euclidean norms of groups of the regression parameter vector. The net advantage of the method over the existing group lasso-type procedures consists in the form of the proportionality factor used in the penalty term, which for GSRL is independent of the variance of the error terms. This is of crucial importance in models with more parameters than the sample size, when estimating the variance of the noise becomes as difficult as the original problem. We show that the GSRL estimator adapts to the unknown sparsity of the regression vector, and has the same optimal estimation and prediction accuracy as the GL estimators, under the same minimal conditions on the model. This extends the results recently established for the square-root lasso, for sparse regression without group structure. Moreover, as a new type of result for square-root lasso methods, with or without groups, we study correct pattern recovery, and show that it can be achieved under conditions similar to those needed by the lasso or group-lasso-type methods, but with a simplified tuning strategy. We implement our method via a new algorithm, with proved convergence properties, which, unlike existing methods, scales well with the dimension of the problem. Our simulation studies support strongly our theoretical findings.",2014,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory

Overlapping group screening for detection of gene-gene interactions: application to gene expression profiles with survival trait,"BackgroundThe development of a disease is a complex process that may result from joint effects of multiple genes. In this article, we propose the overlapping group screening (OGS) approach to determining active genes and gene-gene interactions incorporating prior pathway information. The OGS method is developed to overcome the challenges in genome-wide data analysis that the number of the genes and gene-gene interactions is far greater than the sample size, and the pathways generally overlap with one another. The OGS method is further proposed for patientsâ€™ survival prediction based on gene expression data.ResultsSimulation studies demonstrate that the performance of the OGS approach in identifying the true main and interaction effects is good and the survival prediction accuracy of OGS with the Lasso penalty is better than the ordinary Lasso method. In real data analysis, we identify several significant genes and/or epistasis interactions that are associated with clinical survival outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by utilizing prior pathway information from the KEGG pathway and the GO biological process databases, respectively.ConclusionsThe OGS approach is useful for selecting important genes and epistasis interactions in the ultra-high dimensional feature space. The prediction ability of OGS with the Lasso penalty is better than existing methods. The OGS approach is generally applicable to various types of outcome data (quantitative, qualitative, censored event time data) and regression models (e.g. linear, logistic, and Coxâ€™s regression models).",2018,BMC Bioinformatics

Reprising the Third Way: an early draft of an almost middlingproposal,"Does the middle of the road always need to have one placed in danger of being, rather tediously and slowly, run over by a minibus full of mediocrity? Must we always hyperventilate ourselves towards the extremes looking for revolution? Unfashionable though it may be, in this paper I want to revise (bring back, if you will) some version of Giddens's Third Way. And back is 'back'. The speculative turn onto the natural sciences and our knowledge of 'nature', has moved us mid-way between correlationism (Meillassoux, 2009) and speculation on the-thing-in-itself. In Dorsality, David Wills brilliantly watches his and others' backs, the splendor in that turn at the edge (but patently not a move back to language, â€œ[a] primary technological systemâ€ (p14)). Heidegger wants us to be patient, wait for an event, an occurrence, even while Adrian Johnston (2014) joins Zizek and Badiou in their fear of political and ideological stasis guided helpfully by the structural status quo. And we wait for a revolutionary spark, a cause, that never happens.... 
 
On the way back then, back to the centre, some kind of paradoxical conservative, knowing disruption happens. The familiar makes us cozy up to a constantlly-forgotten type of creativity. In my essay paper to The Maintainers, I want to present the following examples, drawing from speculative realist/STS readings of futures: political calmness in the face of capitalist techno-realities, the post-punk New Wave movement from 1970s into 1980s, and the implications of the Paris COP21 â€˜dealâ€™. 
 
I will address two themes of the conference : 1) what is at stake if we move scholarship away from innovation and toward maintenance; and 2)theories, methods, and sources that might study a steady, yet creative, type of maintenance. This all fits within how we study structure in culture, technoscience and social order.",2016,
A Note on LASSO History: Addendum to the 2001 Presidential Address,"A copy has surfaced of the early 1972 Winfred Lehmann letter that set in motion events leading to the establishment of the Linguistic Association of the Southwest (LASSO), revealing some new details about the efforts to found LASSO. ********* Perhaps the document most immediately responsible for setting in motion the chain of events culminating in the formation of the Linguistic Association of the Southwest (LASSO) in October, 1972, is a letter written in February of that same year by Winfred Lehmann, then Chair of Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin. In the Presidential Address to the 30th Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Association of the Southwest, with only indirect documentary support, I said that 'sometime before March 8, 1972, Lehmann sent out a letter to one or more linguists in the southwestern region asking them if they agreed that the Southwest needed a regional linguistic association and asking them to suggest names of linguists in the region who could be contacted to help found such a group' (Boertien 2002:5). A copy of that letter has now surfaced, dug up from his seemingly bottomless files by Lehmann himself, confirming the conjecture and providing several additional interesting facts about the efforts leading up to the formation of LASSO. (See Appendix.) The letter, dated February 29, 1972, and addressed to Garland Cannon, then Coordinator of the Interdepartmental Committee in Linguistics at Texas A&M University, reveals that Lehmann sent this letter (or versions of it) to three Texas area linguists. One of course was Cannon, whose March 8, 1972, letter of reply appears as Appendix A in Boertien (2002). A second was almost certainly Jacob Ornstein, then a co-director of the Cross-Cultural Southwest Ethnic Study Center at the University of Texas at El Paso, whose March 14, 1972, letter to Lehmann, acknowledging hearing from him and clearly responding to the same requests as those addressed to Cannon, appears as Appendix B in Boertien (2002). An intriguing note in Lehmann's handwriting at the bottom of his copy of the February, 1972, letter suggests that the third recipient might have been James Wyatt of the University of Texas at Arlington. Lehmann, however, says in a September 6, 2003, e-mail message to me that he believes that the third recipient was Silas Griggs of North Texas State University in Denton (now the University of North Texas), with whom Lehmann was in frequent contact during the formative years of LASSO. The message also says that he had jotted down Wyatt's name, perhaps at Griggs' suggestion, as another linguist to be approached in the formation effort. Somewhat surprisingly, Lehmann says in his letter that he had 'resisted this step for some time now', which raises the obvious questions of why he would have resisted taking this step toward forming LASSO and for how long he had been resisting. It turns out that, with regard to the latter, discussions with colleagues both inside and outside his department had taken place at least since 1968 and, with regard to the former, his hesitance stemmed primarily from a lack of support in his own department for forming a new association. In his September e-mail message to me Lehmann quotes as follows from a November 8, 1968, letter he had sent to Frances Ingemann, Chair of Linguistics at the University of Kansas: 'I have asked members of our staff about forming a regional linguistic association. I regret to say that they are very negative. They feel that we already have enough meetings to go to, and on the other hand think that regional associations very commonly fail to maintain a high level'. As we know, however, he felt strongly enough about the need for a regional association to go ahead with the effort to form one, even without all the local support he must have hoped for. Nevertheless, he appears to have had some reservations about the work this would entail, as he says in an April 20, 1972, letter to Cannon (also quoted in the September e-mail), that he hopes he is not 'foisting a monster on our overworked colleagues down here'. â€¦",2004,Southwest Journal of Linguistics
Comparison of techniques for the estimation of daily global irradiation and a new technique for the estimation of hourly global irradiation,"Global irradiation and sunshine duration data recorded at Trieste (CNR, Istituto Talassografico di Trieste) during the 11-year period 1972â€“1982 are analyzed using the classical Angstrom equation H = H0 (a + bS/S0) and the equation Hâ€² = H0 (a + bS/Sâ€²0) suggested by Hay [7] for incorporating the effects of (i) multiple reflections, and (ii) not burning of the sunshine recorder chart for small elevation of the sun. The values of the regression constants and the correlation coefficients are calculated using each yearly data set separately. Correlation coefficients of 0Â·89 or more are obtained for the 11 years. Substantial unsystematic scatter is obtained in the values of a as well as b for different years. The use of the equation Hâ€² = H0 (a + bS/Sâ€²0) is not found to either decrease this scatter or to give better values of the correlation coefficients. 
 
Hourly global irradiation data is also analyzed. Eleven-year mean values of the ratio hourly/daily are plotted against the solar time for each of the 12 months of the year. The normal distribution curve 
P(t) = 12Ï€rexpâˆ’(tâˆ’12)22Ïƒ 
is found to fit the data closely. The mean of the normal distribution is taken at the solar noon and the Ïƒ values are obtained for each month by matching the experimental and the theoretical values at the solar noon. The Ïƒ values so obtained are found to bear an excellent linear correlation (r = 0Â·996) with S0, viz.Ïƒ = 0Â·461 + 0Â·192 S0. This provides a simple and elegant technique for estimating hourly irradiation from the daily values and may be of universal applicability. The technique enables the estimation of global irradiation for any smaller interval of time as well.",1984,Solar & Wind Technology
Model Selection for Spatially Correlated Data,"The aim of this paper is to compare several model selection techniques in detrending the error process under spatially dependent data with correlated regressors. Among the available model selection methods I compare the Adaptive Lasso (alasso) estimator (Zou, 2006), the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (scad) estimator (Fan and Li, 2001), the least absolute shrinkage and selection (lasso) operator (Tibshirani, 1996) and elastic net estimator (Zou and Hastie, 2005). Among the various error processes I focus in fitting the Exponential covariance functions for the variogram estimation. I found that the adaptive lasso is the best among the analyzed techniques.

Fixed effects selection in the linear mixed-effects model using adaptive ridge procedure for L0 penalty performance,"This paper is concerned with the selection of fixed effects along with the estimation of fixed effects, random effects and variance components in the linear mixed-effects model. We introduce a selection procedure based on an adaptive ridge (AR) penalty of the profiled likelihood, where the covariance matrix of the random effects is Cholesky factorized. This selection procedure is intended to both low and high-dimensional settings where the number of fixed effects is allowed to grow exponentially with the total sample size, yielding technical difficulties due to the non-convex optimization problem induced by L0 penalties. Through extensive simulation studies, the procedure is compared to the LASSO selection and appears to enjoy the model selection consistency as well as the estimation consistency.",2017,arXiv: Methodology

Comprehensible Predictive Modeling Using Regularized Logistic Regression and Comorbidity Based Features,"Different studies have demonstrated the importance of comorbidities to better understand the origin and evolution of medical complications. This study focuses on improvement of the predictive model interpretability based on simple logical features representing comorbidities. We use group lasso based feature interaction discovery followed by a post-processing step, where simple logic terms are added. In the final step, we reduce the feature set by applying lasso logistic regression to obtain a compact set of non-zero coefficients that represent a more comprehensible predictive model. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated on a pediatric hospital discharge dataset that was used to build a readmission risk estimation model. The evaluation of the proposed method demonstrates a reduction of the initial set of features in a regression model by 72%, with a slight improvement in the Area Under the ROC Curve metric from 0.763 (95% CI: 0.755-0.771) to 0.769 (95% CI: 0.761-0.777). Additionally, our results show improvement in comprehensibility of the final predictive model using simple comorbidity based terms for logistic regression.",2015,PLoS ONE
A generalized framework for controlling FDR in gene regulatory network inference,"Motivation Inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from perturbation data can give detailed mechanistic insights of a biological system. Many inference methods exist, but the resulting GRN is generally sensitive to the choice of methodâ€specific parameters. Even though the inferred GRN is optimal given the parameters, many links may be wrong or missing if the data is not informative. To make GRN inference reliable, a method is needed to estimate the support of each predicted link as the method parameters are varied. Results To achieve this we have developed a method called nested bootstrapping, which applies a bootstrapping protocol to GRN inference, and by repeated bootstrap runs assesses the stability of the estimated support values. To translate bootstrap support values to false discovery rates we run the same pipeline with shuffled data as input. This provides a general method to control the false discovery rate of GRN inference that can be applied to any setting of inference parameters, noise level, or data properties. We evaluated nested bootstrapping on a simulated dataset spanning a range of such properties, using the LASSO, Least Squares, RNI, GENIE3 and CLR inference methods. An improved inference accuracy was observed in almost all situations. Nested bootstrapping was incorporated into the GeneSPIDER package, which was also used for generating the simulated networks and data, as well as running and analyzing the inferences.

Does Breastmilk Influence the Development of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia?,"OBJECTIVE
To assess whether breastmilk feeding is associated with a reduced risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Secondary outcome measures analyzed were retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).


STUDY DESIGN
In an ongoing multicenter cohort study, the data of 1433 very low birth weight infants born before 32Â weeks of gestation and discharged in 2013 were analyzed. We compared growth and neonatal complications of infants who received breastmilk exclusively (NÂ =Â 223) with those who received formula feedings exclusively (NÂ =Â 239). Logistic regression models were estimated for BPD, ROP, and NEC using nutrition as an independent variable. The Firth logistic regression model and Lasso were used for sensitivity analyses.


RESULTS
Exclusively breastmilk-fed infants gained less weight compared with formula-fed infants. SDS for weight decreased between birth and discharge (median (Q1-Q3): formula -0.9 (-1.4 to [-0.5]) vs breastmilk -1.1 (-1.7 to [-0.6])). Exclusive formula feeding of very low birth weight infants was associated with increased risks of BPD (OR 2.6) as well as NEC (OR 12.6) and ROP (OR 1.80) after controlling for known risk factors.


CONCLUSIONS
Exclusive breastmilk feeding was associated with lower growth rates and a reduced risk of BPD as well as NEC and ROP.",2016,The Journal of pediatrics

SETTING
Ten UK accredited gynaecological oncology centres.


POPULATION
Women undergoing major surgery on a gynaecological oncology operating list.


METHODS
Patient co-morbidity, surgical procedures and intra-operative (IntraOp) complications were recorded contemporaneously by surgeons for 2948 major surgical procedures. Postoperative (PostOp) complications were collected from hospitals and patients. Risk-prediction models for IntraOp and PostOp complications were created using penalised (lasso) logistic regression using over 30 potential patient/surgical risk factors.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Observed and risk-adjusted IntraOp and PostOp CRs for individual hospitals were calculated. Benchmarking using colour-coded funnel plots and observed-to-expected ratios was undertaken.


RESULTS
Overall, IntraOp CR was 4.7% (95% CI 4.0-5.6) and PostOp CR was 25.7% (95% CI 23.7-28.2). The observed CRs for all hospitals were under the upper 95% control limit for both IntraOp and PostOp funnel plots. Risk-adjustment and use of observed-to-expected ratio resulted in one hospital moving to the >95-98% CI (red) band for IntraOp CRs. Use of only hospital-reported data for PostOp CRs would have resulted in one hospital being unfairly allocated to the red band. There was little concordance between IntraOp and PostOp CRs.


CONCLUSION
The funnel plots and overall IntraOp (â‰ˆ5%) and PostOp (â‰ˆ26%) CRs could be used for benchmarking gynaecological oncology centres. Hospital benchmarking using risk-adjusted CRs allows fairer institutional comparison. IntraOp and PostOp CRs are best assessed separately. As hospital under-reporting is common for postoperative complications, use of patient-reported outcomes is important.


TWEETABLE ABSTRACT

"Multiple lines of evidence clarify limits of Allocasuarina thalassoscopica, A. defungens and A. littoralis (Allocasuarina sect. Cylindropitys, Casuarinaceae)","Abstract. 
 Uncertainty in identifying Allocasuarina shrubs of the North Coast botanical region of New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland prompted investigation of species limits using morphological and cytological data. PATN analysis using 36 morphometric characters, seedling morphology and cytogenetic analysis supported the existing circumscription of A. defungens and A. simulans. Trees of A. littoralis were observed throughout the study area and the distinct morphology of the diploid and polyploid forms is noted. Further work is required to establish whether these differences are consistent over the full range of the species. Shrubby plants of A. sect. Cylindropitys, other than the above species, growing along the NSW North Coast are currently known by several names, including A. defungens Ã— A. littoralis. These plants were found to be morphologically most similar to A. emuina and A. thalassoscopica from south-eastern Queensland and to have similar phenotypes. Allocasuarina thalassoscopica is recircumscribed on morphological characters to encompass these shrubby plants in New South Wales and A. emuina and A. thalassoscopica from south-eastern Queensland. A key is provided for identification of plants of A. sect. Cylindropitys. Counts of chromosomes found that recircumscribed A. thalassoscopica is tetraploid and A. defungens is triploid at Nabiac but tetraploid at Khappinghat Nature Reserve. The results of the present study are consistent with a hypothesis of parallel evolution, which is possibly due to edaphic factors and requires further study.",2015,Australian Systematic Botany
Long-term outcomes after radiofrequency catheter ablation of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation,"Background : Short-term oucomes of radiofrequency (RF) catheter isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVs) in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (PAF/PEAF) are encouraging. However, long-term outcomes are not well defined. Therefore, we evaluated 3â€“5-year outcomes in our series of patients. Freedom from symptomatic AF/flutter/tachycardia recurrences with patients off antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) was considered a treatment success. Methods : Consecutive patients with symptomatic PAF/PEAF and AAD failure, without significant structural heart disease, were prospectively recruited between September 2003 and November 2009. Irrigated-tip RF ablation catheter and Lasso catheter were used after standard trans-septal approach with X-ray fluoroscopic guidance. Ablation endpoints were: complete segmental/circumferential ostial and antral electrical PV isolation, non-PV foci ablation, and bi-directional flutter isthmus (FI) block when indicated. The procedure was repeated if AF/flutter/tachycardia recurred after 3-month blanking period. The suspected arrhythmia recurrences were evaluated by series of ECG/Holter recordings. Data were analyzed by t-, chi-square, and Fisherâ€™s exact tests. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results : In 126 patients, median age 55 years (range 19â€“75), 94 men (75 %), 86 with PAF and 40 with PEAF (31 %), 207 procedures were performed: single in 63 (50 %), double in 48 (38 %), and multiple in 15. FI was ablated in 53 patients (42 %). Tamponade occurred in 4 (3 %). No PV stenosis, esophageal injury, or stroke were detected clinically in 115 patients (91 %) during 36-month (13â€“89) follow-up. We achieved treatment success in 69 patients (61 %), partial success with a significant reduction of AF/flutter/tachycardia recurrences on AAD in 13 patients (12 %), and in 33 patients (27 %) the procedure was not successful. Overall, 73 % of our patients had long-term benefit. Outcomes were better in patients with PAF vs. PEAF (84 % vs. 48 %, p < 0,001), in younger age, in those without concomitant diseases, and in those with normal PV anatomy. These results were maintained in the subgroup of 58 patients over 56 months of follow-up: 35 (60 %), 6 (11 %), and 17 (29 %), respectively. Conclusions : Lasso-guided RF irrigated-tip segmental/circumferential PV isolation is a safe and long-term successful treatment of PAF in the majority of our patients. The method needs improvements in patients with PEAF, possibly with the introduction of new technologies.",2013,Slovenian Medical Journal
Vampires in the oceans: predatory cercozoan amoebae in marine habitats,"Vampire amoebae (vampyrellids) are predators of algae, fungi, protozoa and small metazoans known primarily from soils and in freshwater habitats. They are among the very few heterotrophic naked, filose and reticulose protists that have received some attention from a morphological and ecological point of view over the last few decades, because of the peculiar mode of feeding of known species. Yet, the true extent of their biodiversity remains largely unknown. Here we use a complementary approach of culturing and sequence database mining to address this issue, focusing our efforts on marine environments, where vampyrellids are very poorly known. We present 10 new vampyrellid isolates, 8 from marine or brackish sediments, and 2 from soil or freshwater sediment. Two of the former correspond to the genera Thalassomyxa Grell and Penardia Cash for which sequence data were previously unavailable. Small-subunit ribosomal DNA analysis confirms they are all related to previously sequenced vampyrellids. An exhaustive screening of the NCBI GenBank database and of 454 sequence data generated by the European BioMarKs consortium revealed hundreds of distinct environmental vampyrellid sequences. We show that vampyrellids are much more diverse than previously thought, especially in marine habitats. Our new isolates, which cover almost the full phylogenetic range of vampyrellid sequences revealed in this study, offer a rare opportunity to integrate data from environmental DNA surveys with phenotypic information. However, the very large genetic diversity we highlight within vampyrellids (especially in marine sediments and soils) contrasts with the paradoxically low morphological distinctiveness we observed across our isolates.",2013,The ISME Journal
Recognizing surgical patterns,"In the Netherlands, each year over 1700 patients die from preventable surgical errors. Numerous initiatives to improve surgical practice have had some impact, but problems persist. Despite the introduction of checklists and protocols, patient safety in surgery remains a continuing challenge. This is complicated by some surgeons viewing their own work as an artistic manoeuver whose workflow cannot be captured. However, safeguarding patient safety is also a hospital's management responsibility and no longer only in the surgeon's hands. In spite of the inherent variations, surgeries of the same kind produce similar data, and are usually performed in similar workflows. Surgery is characterized by a peri-operative pipeline of pre-, intra- and post-operative processes. To both reduce errors and improve efficiency, the workflow in the peri-operative pipeline should be designed and planned as effectively as possible in terms of flow of patients and allocation of scarce resources such as operating rooms, instruments and personnel. Currently, planning is done on a very basic level, without using real-world data to learn and improve efficiency. Fortunately, there is lot of available, but unexploited data about surgical interventions that can be used for this purpose. The aim of this thesis is to use acquired and registered peri-operative data to support hospital management to improve safety and efficiency in surgery. The method of assessing safety and efficiency in surgery for individual patients needs to be tailored to each patient. As a result generalization of the results is difficult. We discuss how pattern recognition (PR) provides tools for the assessment of surgical outcome for individual patients. It also allows for handling of outliers and does not impose the same restrictions on data collection procedures as for randomized controlled trials. We show that PR is a pragmatic next step towards data intensive operating rooms with evidence based support for surgeries. Below the techniques as proposed in this thesis are brie y described. To support pre-operative planning of surgeries, assessment of surgical complexity is needed beforehand in order to prepare and possibly avoid complications and delays. This complexity assessment can also aid surgeons in decisions regarding how to proceed with the surgical procedure, for instance by taking extra precautions or making a referral to a more experienced surgeon when a complex surgery is predicted. We show how to use readily available patient data to predict surgical complexity. Classifiers are trained and evaluated using readily collected data from patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LAPCHOL). It is shown that complexity of LAPCHOL surgeries can be predicted in the pre-operative stage with accuracy up to 83% using an LDC or SVM classifier. We also derived the set of features that are relevant for predicting complexity including inflammation, wall thickening, sex and BMI score. To realize intra-operative safety and efficiency goals in surgery, hospitals are searching for autonomous systems for monitoring the surgical workflow in the operating room (OR). In this thesis we propose an autonomous registration technique for the OR. Registering the time of use of surgical instruments and the sequence in which they are used enables us to detect the surgical steps, including the duration of each step. By deploying this as a real-time system, dynamic support for the surgical team and dynamic planning of patients can be performed. For monitoring the usage of surgical instruments, signals from sensors which can detect video, motion and RFID tags can be used. For the application in the OR, it is necessary that these sensors are designed to meet the requirements of the OR environment, specifically with respect to sterilization and non-intrusiveness. We propose a tracking system to detect and track instruments in endoscopic video using biocompatible and sterilization-proof colour markers. The system tracks single and multiple instruments in the video. The output of the tracking tool is a log file with an identifier of the instrument used and the duration of its use for each entry. These instrument logs are then used for workflow mining and outlier detection in surgery. We derived a surgical consensus from multiple surgery logs using global multiple sequence alignment. We showed that the derived consensus conforms to the main steps of laparoscopic cholecystectomy as described in best practices. Using global pair-wise alignment, we showed that outliers from this consensus can be detected using the surgical log. These outliers are commonly simple variations in the execution of the surgical procedure, but can also represent serious complications or errors. To improve post-operative efficiency, accurate predictions of patients' length of stay (LOS) in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) may lead to cost savings and a number of other efficiency benefits. We propose to use available perioperative data to predict the PACU LOS, using the features case demographics, intra-operative parameters, medications, patient co-morbidities, and surgeon. A linear regression method was used along with ordinary least square regression and `least absolute shrinkage and selection operator' (LASSO-) regression. A forward feature selection approach was then used to identify and rank factors that impact PACU LOS. We showed that PACU LOS can be predicted by perioperative factors with an improvement of 12-18 minutes compared to using the mean baseline. If this prediction is updated with online information, mainly by monitoring post-operative oxygen saturation, future work could lead to real-time LOS algorithms based on peri-operative factors to predict, manage and possibly intercept anticipated, prolonged PACU LOS. This thesis has proposed and demonstrated the application of pattern recognition tools to log, assess and predict surgical workflow parameters. Work in this thesis did not directly contribute to reduce errors and safety in the OR. However, the tools developed in the thesis can be used to support standardization of surgical workflow to both reduce errors and support surgical planning. Moreover, the proposed techniques for the operating room can be used in other medical domains such as the intensive care unit with only small contextual modifications.",2012,
Weakly decomposable regularization penalties and structured sparsity,"type=""main"" xml:id=""sjos12032-abs-0001""> It has been shown in literature that the Lasso estimator, or l 1 -penalized least squares estimator, enjoys good oracle properties.

A landscape-level analysis of yellow-cedar decline in coastal British Columbia,"Yellow-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis D. Don (Spach)) is currently undergoing a dramatic decline in western North America. Recent research suggests that site factors combined with a shift in climate have predisposed yellow-cedar trees to decline. We conducted the first landscape-level analysis of the decline in coastal British Columbia to assess relations between the decline and topographic variables. We used lasso-penalized logistic regression to model yellow-cedar decline presence and absence with topographic variables derived from a digital elevation model. Model results indicated that low elevation sites close to the coast, which are more exposed and have more variation in elevation, are more likely to show evidence of decline. The logistic model fit the data well (Nagelkerke R2 = 0.846) and had high predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.98). The topographic variables identified by the model influence degree of soil saturation, temperatures, and snowpack presence in a forest stand, supporting the proposed a...",2011,Canadian Journal of Forest Research
Inference with normal-gamma prior distributions in regression problems,"This paper considers the efiects of placing an absolutely continuous prior distribution on the regression coe-cients of a linear model. We show that the posterior expectation is a matrix-shrunken version of the least squares estimate where the shrinkage matrix depends on the derivatives of the prior predictive den- sity of the least squares estimate. The special case of the normal-gamma prior, which generalizes the Bayesian Lasso (Park and Casella 2008), is studied in depth. We discuss the prior interpretation and the posterior efiects of hyperparameter choice and suggest a data-dependent default prior. Simulations and a chemomet- ric example are used to compare the performance of the normal-gamma and the Bayesian Lasso in terms of out-of-sample predictive performance.",2010,Bayesian Analysis
Scalable Price Targeting,"We study the welfare implications of scalable price targeting, an extreme form of third-degree price discrimination implemented with machine learning for a large, digital firm. Targeted prices are computed by solving the firm's Bayesian Decision-Theoretic pricing problem based on a database with a high-dimensional vector of customer features that are observed prior to the price quote. To identify the causal effect of price on demand, we first run a large, randomized price experiment and use these data to train our demand model. We use l1 regularization (lasso) to select the set of customer features that moderate the heterogeneous treatment effect of price on demand. We use a weighted likelihood Bayesian bootstrap to quantify the firm's approximate statistical uncertainty in demand and profitability. We then conduct a second experiment that implements our proposed price targeting scheme out of sample. Theoretically, both firm and customer surplus could rise with scalable price targeting. Optimized uniform pricing improves revenues by 64.9% relative to the control pricing, whereas scalable price targeting improves revenues by 81.5%. Firm profits increase by over 10% under targeted pricing relative to optimal uniform pricing. Customer surplus declines by less than 1% with price targeting; although nearly 70% of customers are charged less than the uniform price. Our weighted likelihood bootstrap estimator also predicts demand and demand uncertainty out of sample better than several alternative approaches.",2017,National Bureau of Economic Research
Online Batch Decision-Making with High-Dimensional Covariates,"We propose and investigate a class of new algorithms for sequential decision making that interacts with \textit{a batch of users} simultaneously instead of \textit{a user} at each decision epoch. This type of batch models is motivated by interactive marketing and clinical trial, where a group of people are treated simultaneously and the outcomes of the whole group are collected before the next stage of decision. In such a scenario, our goal is to allocate a batch of treatments to maximize treatment efficacy based on observed high-dimensional user covariates. We deliver a solution, named \textit{\texttt{Teamwork LASSO Bandit} algorithm}, that resolves a batch version of explore-exploit dilemma via switching between teamwork stage and selfish stage during the whole decision process. This is made possible based on statistical properties of LASSO estimate of treatment efficacy that adapts to a sequence of batch observations. In general, a rate of optimal allocation condition is proposed to delineate the exploration and exploitation trade-off on the data collection scheme, which is sufficient for LASSO to identify the optimal treatment for observed user covariates. An upper bound on expected cumulative regret of the proposed algorithm is provided.",2020,ArXiv
An accelerated dual method for SPGL1,"This thesis studies a well-known solver SPGL1, which applies a general rootfinding process to solve the basis pursuit denoising problem. This process involves a nested loop. The outer loop is an inexact Newton root-finding process, and the inner loop approximately solves LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). We propose an accelerated dual method to accelerate the inner loop by optimizing the dual problem of LASSO on a low-dimensional space. Experimental results show that our accelerated method that can successfully reduce the total iteration counts. Our future work is to reduce the total running time of our accelerated method.",2019,
Vector Autoregressive Models with Spatially Structured Coefficients for Time Series on a Spatial Grid,"We propose a parsimonious spatiotemporal model for time series data on a spatial grid. Our model is capable of dealing with high-dimensional time series data that may be collected at hundreds of locations and capturing the spatial non-stationarity. In essence, our model is a vector autoregressive model that utilizes the spatial structure to achieve parsimony of autoregressive matrices at two levels. The first level ensures the sparsity of the autoregressive matrices using a lagged-neighborhood scheme. The second level performs a spatial clustering of the non-zero autoregressive coefficients such that nearby locations share similar coefficients. This model is interpretable and can be used to identify geographical subregions, within each of which, the time series share similar dynamical behavior with homogeneous autoregressive coefficients. The model parameters are obtained using the penalized maximum likelihood with an adaptive fused Lasso penalty. The estimation procedure is easy to implement and can be tailored to the need of a modeler. We illustrate the performance of the proposed estimation algorithm in a simulation study. We apply our model to a wind speed time series dataset generated from a climate model over Saudi Arabia to illustrate its usefulness. Limitations and possible extensions of our method are also discussed.",2020,arXiv: Methodology
Human cytomegalovirus: properties of the complement-fixing antigen.,"Summary The correlation between infectivity, virus particle counts, and complement-fixing activity was studied with cell-associated and fluid phase preparations of two strains of human cytomegalovirus. CF antigen was detected only in cellassociated virus preparations and was not found in fluid phase virus preparations. The CF antigen obtained from cell-associated virus preparations was found to be stable at 4Â°C but was unstable at 37Â°C, which is just the reverse behavior of cytomegalovirus infectivity. When subjected to ultracentrifugation at speeds which sedimented virtually all of the virus particles, about 50% of the CF antigen behaved as a subviral â€œsolubleâ€ component and remained in the supernatant fluid.",1966,Journal of immunology
The Model Selection Methods for Sparse Biological Networks,"It is still crucial problem to estimate high dimensional graphical models and to choose the regularization parameter in dependent data. There are several classical methods such as Akaikeâ€™s information criterion and Bayesian Information criterion to solve this problem, but also more recent methods have been proposed such as stability selection and stability approach to regularization selection method (StARS) and some extensions of AIC and BIC which are more appropriate for high dimensional datasets. In this review, we give some overview about these methods and also give their consistency properties for graphical lasso. Then, we evaluate the performance of these approaches in real datasets. Finally, we propose the theoretical background of our proposal model selection criterion that is based on the KL-divergence and the bootstrapping computation, and is particularly suggested for the sparse biological networks.",2019,
A general family of trimmed estimators for robust high-dimensional data analysis,"We consider the problem of robustifying high-dimensional structured estimation. Robust techniques are key in real-world applications which often involve outliers and data corruption. We focus on trimmed versions of structurally regularized M-estimators in the high-dimensional setting, including the popular Least Trimmed Squares estimator, as well as analogous estimators for generalized linear models and graphical models, using possibly non-convex loss functions. We present a general analysis of their statistical convergence rates and consistency, and then take a closer look at the trimmed versions of the Lasso and Graphical Lasso estimators as special cases. On the optimization side, we show how to extend algorithms for M-estimators to fit trimmed variants and provide guarantees on their numerical convergence. The generality and competitive performance of high-dimensional trimmed estimators are illustrated numerically on both simulated and real-world genomics data.",2016,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Lass-0: sparse non-convex regression by local search,"We compute approximate solutions to L0 regularized linear regression using L1 regularization, also known as the Lasso, as an initialization step. Our algorithm, the Lass-0 (""Lass-zero""), uses a computationally efficient stepwise search to determine a locally optimal L0 solution given any L1 regularization solution. We present theoretical results of consistency under orthogonality and appropriate handling of redundant features. Empirically, we use synthetic data to demonstrate that Lass-0 solutions are closer to the true sparse support than L1 regularization models. Additionally, in real-world data Lass-0 finds more parsimonious solutions than L1 regularization while maintaining similar predictive accuracy.",2015,arXiv: Machine Learning

Bayesian methods for skewed response including longitudinal and heteroscedastic data,"Skewed response data are very popular in practice, especially in biomedical area. We begin our work from the skewed longitudinal response without heteroscedasticity. We extend the skewed error density to the multivariate response. Then we study the heterocedasticity. We extend the transform-both-sides model to the bayesian variable selection area to handle the univariate skewed response, where the variance of response is a function of the median. At last, we proposed a novel model to handle the skewed univariate response with a flexible heteroscedasticity. For longitudinal studies with heavily skewed continuous response, statistical model and methods focusing on mean response are not appropriate. In this paper, we present a partial linear model of median regression function of skewed longitudinal response. We develop a semiparametric Bayesian estimation procedure using an appropriate Dirichlet process mixture prior for the skewed error distribution. We provide justifications for using our methods including theoretical investigation of the support of the prior, asymptotic properties of the posterior and also simulation studies of finite sample properties. Ease of implementation and advantages of our model and method compared to existing methods are illustrated via analysis of a cardiotoxicity study of children of HIV infected mother. Our second aim is to develop a Bayesian simultaneous variable selection and estimation of median regression for skewed response variable. Our hierarchical Bayesian model can incorporate advantages of l0 penalty for skewed and heteroscedastic error. Some preliminary simulation studies have been conducted to compare the performance of proposed model and existing frequentist median lasso regression model. Considering the estimation bias and total square error, our proposed model performs as good as, or better than competing frequentist estimators. In biomedical studies, the covariates often affect the location, scale as well as the shape of the skewed response distribution. Existing biostatistical literature mainly focuses on the mean regression with a symmetric error distribution. While such modeling assumptions and methods are often deemed as restrictive and inappropriate for skewed response, the completely nonparametric methods may lack a physical interpretation of the covariate effects. Existing nonparametric methods also miss any easily implementable computational tool. For a skewed response, we develop a novel model accommodating a nonparametric error density that depends on the covariates. The advantages of our semiparametric associated Bayes method include the ease of prior elicitation/determination, an easily implementable posterior computation,",2013,
Sure independence screening for analyzing supersaturated designs,"ABSTRACT Supersaturated designs (SSDs) constitute a large class of fractional factorial designs which can be used for screening out the important factors from a large set of potentially active ones. A major advantage of these designs is that they reduce the experimental cost dramatically, but their crucial disadvantage is the confounding involved in the statistical analysis. Identification of active effects in SSDs has been the subject of much recent study. In this article we present a two-stage procedure for analyzing two-level SSDs assuming a main-effect only model, without including any interaction terms. This method combines sure independence screening (SIS) with different penalty functions; such as Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD), Lasso and MC penalty achieving both the down-selection and the estimation of the significant effects, simultaneously. Insights on using the proposed methodology are provided through various simulation scenarios and several comparisons with existing approaches, such as stepwise in combination with SCAD and Dantzig Selector (DS) are presented as well. Results of the numerical study and real data analysis reveal that the proposed procedure can be considered as an advantageous tool due to its extremely good performance for identifying active factors.",2019,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation

Mobile visual search via hievarchical sparse coding,"Mobile visual search is attracting much research attention recently. Existing works focus on addressing the limited capacity of wireless channel yet overlook its instability, thus is not adaptive to the change of channel capacity. In this paper, a novel image retrieval algorithm that is scalable to various channel condition is proposed. The proposed algorithm contains three contributions: (1) to achieve instant retrieval under various channel capacity, we adjust transmission load by sparseness instead of codebook size; (2) we introduce hierarchical sparse coding into our retrieval workflow, where original codebook is transformed into a tree-structured dictionary which implies elements' priority; (3) we propose transmission priority ranking schemes that is adaptive to specific query. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms BoW and Lasso based algorithm under different parameter settings. Retrieval results under different channel limitation validate the scalability of our method.",2014,2014 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)
Statistical Approaches to De-aliasing with Application to Earth System Monitoring,"Space-borne altimeters typically have a repeat time of order 10 days and so alias high frequency sea level variability. State-of-the-art de-aliasing methods are presently based on tidal and atmospheric corrections from dynamical models. However, analysis shows that significant high frequency variability remains after such corrections that could cause aliasing problems. In order to further de-alias the altimetry products, a statistical de-aliasing model is designed. Three methods are designed to fit the model (i) in the lag domain, (ii) in the frequency domain, and (iii) in the time domain using the lasso to limit the number of predictors. The three methods are first tested in two simulation-based studies and shown to be both effective and interpretable. The methods are then applied to the altimetry products. The lasso-based method performs best and reduces the standard deviation of the satellite altimetry products in the Gulf of St. Lawrence from about 8 cm to 6 cm.",2015,
Exploring Sparsity in Multi-class Linear Discriminant Analysis,"Recent studies in the literature have paid much attention to the sparsity in linear classification tasks. One motivation of imposing sparsity assumption on the linear discriminant direction is to rule out the noninformative features, making hardly contribution to the classification problem. Most of those work were focused on the scenarios of binary classification. In the presence of multi-class data, preceding researches recommended individually pairwise sparse linear discriminant analysis(LDA). However, further sparsity should be explored. In this paper, an estimator of grouped LASSO type is proposed to take advantage of sparsity for multi-class data. It enjoys appealing non-asymptotic properties which allows insignificant correlations among features. This estimator exhibits superior capability on both simulated and real data.",2014,arXiv: Machine Learning
"Genomic prediction accuracies and abilities for growth and wood quality traits of Scots pine, using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data","Higher genetic gains can be achieved through genomic selection (GS) by shortening time of progeny testing in tree breeding programs. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), combined with two imputation methods, allowed us to perform the current genomic prediction study in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). 694 individuals representing 183 full-sib families were genotyped and phenotyped for growth and wood quality traits. 8719 SNPs were used to compare different genomic prediction models. In addition, the impact on the predictive ability (PA) and prediction accuracy to estimate genomic breeding values was evaluated by assigning different ratios of training and validation sets, as well as different subsets of SNP markers. Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) and Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) combined with expectation maximization (EM) imputation algorithm showed higher PAs and prediction accuracies than Bayesian LASSO (BL). A subset of approximately 4000 markers was sufficient to provide the same PAs and accuracies as the full set of 8719 markers. Furthermore, PAs were similar for both pedigree- and genomic-based estimations, whereas accuracies and heritabilities were slightly higher for pedigree-based estimations. However, prediction accuracies of genomic models were sufficient to achieve a higher selection efficiency per year, varying between 50-87% compared to the traditional pedigree-based selection.",2019,bioRxiv
Safe and efficient screening for sparse support vector machine,"Sparse support vector machine (SVM) is a robust predictive model that can effectively remove noise and preserve signals. Like Lasso, it can efficiently learn a solution path based on a set of predefined parameters and therefore provides strong support for model selection. Sparse SVM has been successfully applied in a variety of data mining applications including text mining, bioinformatics, and image processing. The emergence of big-data analysis poses new challenges for model selection with large-scale data that consist of tens of millions samples and features. In this paper, a novel screening technique is proposed to accelerate model selection for l1-regularized l2-SVM and effectively improve its scalability. This technique can precisely identify inactive features in the optimal solution of a l1-regularized l2-SVM model and remove them before training. The technique makes use of the variational inequality and provides a closed-form solution for screening inactive features in different situations. Every feature that is removed by the screening technique is guaranteed to be inactive in the optimal solution. Therefore, when l1-regularized l2-SVM uses the features selected by the technique, it achieves exactly the same result as when it uses the full feature set. Because the technique can remove a large number of inactive features, it can greatly increase the efficiency of model selection for l1-regularized l2-SVM. Experimental results on five high-dimensional benchmark data sets demonstrate the power of the proposed technique.",2014,
Simultaneous analysis of all single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genome-wide association study of rheumatoid arthritis,"The availability of very large number of markers by modern technology makes genome-wide association studies very popular. The usual approach is to test single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) one at a time for association with disease status. However, it may not be possible to detect marginally significant effects by single-SNP analysis. Simultaneous analysis of SNPs enables detection of even those SNPs with small effect by evaluating the collective impact of several neighboring SNPs. Also, false-positive signals may be weakened by the presence of other neighboring SNPs included in the analysis. We analyzed the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium data of Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 using HLasso, a new method for simultaneous analysis of SNPs. The simultaneous analysis approach has excellent control of type I error, and many of the previously reported results of single-SNP analyses were confirmed by this approach.",2009,BMC Proceedings
Detecting Nonlinear Causality in Multivariate Time Series with Sparse Additive Models,"We propose a nonparametric method for detecting nonlinear causal relationship within a set of multidimensional discrete time series, by using sparse additive models (SpAMs). We show that, when the input to the SpAM is a $\beta$-mixing time series, the model can be fitted by first approximating each unknown function with a linear combination of a set of B-spline bases, and then solving a group-lasso-type optimization problem with nonconvex regularization. Theoretically, we characterize the oracle statistical properties of the proposed sparse estimator in function estimation and model selection. Numerically, we propose an efficient pathwise iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (PISTA), which tames the nonconvexity and guarantees linear convergence towards the desired sparse estimator with high probability.",2018,ArXiv
"Biostratigraphy of section of Murshe-1 Well, Bornu Basin, Northeastern Nigeria","Biostratigraphic work using palynology was undertaken in order to re-assess the lithofacies, chronostratigraphy and paleoenvironment of deposition of sediments in Murshe-1 well, Bornu Basin, northeastern Nigeria. Two hundred and ninety ditch cutting samples obtained from the exploratory well located in Bornu Basin were used for lithologiacal description. Out of these, twenty one (21) samples were selected at 27.4m interval for palynological analysis. Samples were analyzed under microscope for litho-description while the selected samples were used for palynological slide preparation. The latter were taken through sediment digestion and floatation of macerals. Various lithofacies relationship is present and five palynological zones were established. The palynological zones established are Triorites africaensis assemblage zone 1 characterized by co-occurrence of Classopollis brasiliensis, Triorites africaensis, and Retimonocolpites sp; dated Turonian age. Syncolporites sp/Milfordia sp assemblage zone 2 is dated Senonian to Campanian based on the assemblage of Syncolporites sp, Milfordia sp, Mauritiidites crassibaculatus, and Aequitridites sp. The Spinizonocolpites baculatus assemblage zone 3 is defined by the co-occurrence of Longapertites marginatus, Periretisyncolpites sp, Trichotomosulcites sp, Auriculiidites sp, Foveotriletes margaritae, Spinizonocolpites baculatus, Monocolpites marginatus, Striatopollis bellus and Retidiporites magdalenensis; depictive of Maastrichtian age. The Proxapertites cursus assemblage zone 4 is distinguished from the older Maastrichtian sediment based on the paucity of palynomorphs and appearance of Verrutricolporites sp.

Best Subset Selection via a Modern Optimization Lens,"In the last twenty-five years (1990-2014), algorithmic advances in integer optimization combined with hardware improvements have resulted in an astonishing 200 billion factor speedup in solving Mixed Integer Optimization (MIO) problems. We present a MIO approach for solving the classical best subset selection problem of choosing $k$ out of $p$ features in linear regression given $n$ observations. We develop a discrete extension of modern first order continuous optimization methods to find high quality feasible solutions that we use as warm starts to a MIO solver that finds provably optimal solutions. The resulting algorithm (a) provides a solution with a guarantee on its suboptimality even if we terminate the algorithm early, (b) can accommodate side constraints on the coefficients of the linear regression and (c) extends to finding best subset solutions for the least absolute deviation loss function. Using a wide variety of synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that our approach solves problems with $n$ in the 1000s and $p$ in the 100s in minutes to provable optimality, and finds near optimal solutions for $n$ in the 100s and $p$ in the 1000s in minutes. We also establish via numerical experiments that the MIO approach performs better than {\texttt {Lasso}} and other popularly used sparse learning procedures, in terms of achieving sparse solutions with good predictive power.",2015,arXiv: Methodology
Learning Sparse Gaussian Markov Networks Using a Greedy Coordinate Ascent Approach,"In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient greedy algorithm, called SINCO, for the Sparse INverse COvariance selection problem, which is equivalent to learning a sparse Gaussian Markov Network, and empirically investigate the structure-recovery properties of the algorithm. Our approach is based on a coordinate ascent method which naturally preserves the sparsity of the network structure. We show that SINCO is often comparable to, and, in various cases, outperforms commonly used approaches such as glasso [7] and COVSEL [1], in terms of both structure-reconstruction error (particularly, false positive error) and computational time. Moreover, our method has the advantage of being easily parallelizable. Finally, we show that SINCO's greedy nature allows reproduction of the regularization path behavior by applying the method to one (sufficiently small) instance of the regularization parameter Î» only; thus, SINCO can obtain a desired number of network links directly, without having to tune the Î» parameter. We evaluate our method empirically on various simulated networks and real-life data from biological and neuroimaging applications.",2010,
Partitioning no-take marine reserve (NTMR) and benthic habitat effects on density of small and large-bodied tropical wrasses,"No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) are increasingly implemented for fisheries management and biodiversity conservation. Yet, assessing NTMR effectiveness depends on partitioning the effects of NTMR protection and benthic habitat on protected species. Such partitioning is often difficult, since most studies lack well-designed sampling programs (i.e. Before-After-Control-Impact-Pair designs) spanning long-term time scales. Spanning 31 years, this study quantifies the effects of NTMR protection and changes to benthic habitat on the density of tropical wrasses (F. Labridae) at Sumilon and Apo Islands, Philippines. Five species of wrasse were studied: two species of large-bodied (40-50 cm TL) Hemigymnus that were vulnerable to fishing, and three species of small-bodied (10-25 cm TL) Thalassoma and Cirrhilabrus that were not targeted by fishing. NTMR protection had no measurable effect on wrasse density, irrespective of species or body size, over 20 (Sumilon) and 31 (Apo) years of protection. However, the density of wrasses was often affected strongly by benthic cover. Hemigymnus spp. had a positive association with hard coral cover, while Thalassoma spp. and Cirrhilabrus spp. had strong positive associations with cover of rubble and dead substratum. These associations were most apparent after environmental disturbances (typhoons, coral bleaching, crown of thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks, use of explosives and drive nets) reduced live hard coral cover and increased cover of rubble, dead substratum and sand. Disturbances that reduced hard coral cover often reduced the density of Hemigymnus spp. and increased the density of Thalassoma spp. and Cirrhilabrus spp. rapidly (1-2 years). As hard coral recovered, density of Hemigymnus spp. often increased while density of Thalassoma spp. and Cirrhilabrus spp. often decreased, often on scales of 5-10 years. This study demonstrates that wrasse population density was influenced more by changes to benthic cover than by protection from fishing.",2017,PLoS ONE
A general framework for fast stagewise algorithms,"Forward stagewise regression follows a very simple strategy for constructing a sequence of sparse regression estimates: it starts with all coefficients equal to zero, and iteratively updates the coefficient (by a small amount e) of the variable that achieves the maximal absolute inner product with the current residual. This procedure has an interesting connection to the lasso: under some conditions, it is known that the sequence of forward stagewise estimates exactly coincides with the lasso path, as the step size e goes to zero. Furthermore, essentially the same equivalence holds outside of least squares regression, with the minimization of a differentiable convex loss function subject to an l1 norm constraint (the stagewise algorithm now updates the coefficient corresponding to the maximal absolute component of the gradient). 
 
Even when they do not match their l1-constrained analogues, stagewise estimates provide a useful approximation, and are computationally appealing. Their success in sparse modeling motivates the question: can a simple, effective strategy like forward stagewise be applied more broadly in other regularization settings, beyond the l1 norm and sparsity? The current paper is an attempt to do just this. We present a general framework for stagewise estimation, which yields fast algorithms for problems such as group-structured learning, matrix completion, image denoising, and more.",2015,J. Mach.

Development and Validation of a 9-Gene Prognostic Signature in Patients With Multiple Myeloma,"Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is one of the most common types of hematological malignance, and the prognosis of MM patients remains poor. Objective: To identify and validate a genetic prognostic signature in patients with MM. Methods: Co-expression network was constructed to identify hub genes related with International Staging System (ISS) stage of MM. Functional analysis of hub genes was conducted. Univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to identify genes correlated with the overall survival (OS) of MM patients. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to minimize overfitting and construct a prognostic signature. The prognostic value of the signature was validated in the test set and an independent validation cohort. Results: A total of 758 hub genes correlated with ISS stage of MM patients were identified, and these hub genes were mainly enriched in several GO terms and KEGG pathways involved in cell proliferation and immune response. Nine hub genes (HLA-DPB1, TOP2A, FABP5, CYP1B1, IGHM, FANCI, LYZ, HMGN5, and BEND6) with non-zero coefficients in the LASSO Cox regression model were used to build a 9-gene prognostic signature. Relapsed MM and ISS stage III MM was associated with high risk score calculated based on the signature. Patients in the 9-gene signature low risk group was significantly associated with better clinical outcome than those in the 9-gene signature high risk group in the training set, test, and validation set. Conclusions: We developed a 9-gene prognostic signature that might be an independent prognostic factor in patients with MM.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
Fast lasso screening tests based on correlations,"Representing a vector as a sparse linear combination of codewords, e.g. by solving a lasso problem, lies at the heart of many machine learning and statistics applications. To improve the efficiency of solving lasso problems, we systematically investigate lasso screening, a process that quickly identifies dictionary entries that won't be used in the optimal sparse representation, and hence can be removed from the problem. We propose a general test called an R region test that unifies existing screening tests and we derive a particular instance called the dome test. This test is stronger than existing screening tests and can be executed in linear-time as a two-pass test with a memory footprint of only three codewords.",2012,"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Advances in Brain Inspired Cognitive Systems,"This special issue focuses on recent advancements in the field of brain-inspired cognitive systems. It comprises 18 articles which are carefully selected, significantly revised versions of papers presented at the seventh International Conference on Brain-Inspired Cognitive Systems (BICS 2015) held at Hefei, China, on December 11â€“13, 2015. The aim of BICS 2015 was to bring together leading scientists, engineers, and educators who use analytic, syntactic, and computational methods both to understand the prodigious processing properties of biological systems and, specifically, of the brain, and to exploit such knowledge to advance computational methods toward higher levels of cognitive competence. The conference featured plenary speeches given by renowned scholars and a range of technical sessions focusing on timely topics of interest to the scientific community. Based on the recommendation of symposium organizers and reviewers, a number of authors were invited to submit revised versions of their contributions to this special issue. All articles went through a rigorous review procedure involving at least three independent experts before being accepted for publication. Chen et al. propose an efficient algorithm for actionbased pedestrian identification using hierarchical matching pursuit and order-preserving sparse coding to identify and classify features.

The authors demonstrate that near-optimal fusion can be learned and is a resource-efficient alternative to empirical estimation of joint probability distributions and Bayesian inference. They also show that their generative learning approach outperforms Bayesian optimum as it is capable of rejecting outliers through detection of systematic changes in input statistics. Mi et al. describe a novel system for occluded face recognition. They propose a new similarity matrix called â€˜averaged degree of aggregation of matched pixelsâ€™ and show that their system is very robust against occlusion and competitive in terms of recognition accuracy and computation time.

Penalized logistic regression for high-dimensional DNA methylation data with case-control studies,"MOTIVATION
DNA methylation is a molecular modification of DNA that plays crucial roles in regulation of gene expression. Particularly, CpG rich regions are frequently hypermethylated in cancer tissues, but not methylated in normal tissues. However, there are not many methodological literatures of case-control association studies for high-dimensional DNA methylation data, compared with those of microarray gene expression. One key feature of DNA methylation data is a grouped structure among CpG sites from a gene that are possibly highly correlated. In this article, we proposed a penalized logistic regression model for correlated DNA methylation CpG sites within genes from high-dimensional array data. Our regularization procedure is based on a combination of the l(1) penalty and squared l(2) penalty on degree-scaled differences of coefficients of CpG sites within one gene, so it induces both sparsity and smoothness with respect to the correlated regression coefficients. We combined the penalized procedure with a stability selection procedure such that a selection probability of each regression coefficient was provided which helps us make a stable and confident selection of methylation CpG sites that are possibly truly associated with the outcome.


RESULTS
Using simulation studies we demonstrated that the proposed procedure outperforms existing main-stream regularization methods such as lasso and elastic-net when data is correlated within a group. We also applied our method to identify important CpG sites and corresponding genes for ovarian cancer from over 20 000 CpGs generated from Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27K Beadchip. Some genes identified are potentially associated with cancers.",2012,Bioinformatics
Combining least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and heat map visualization for biomarkers detection of LGL leukemia,"Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is type of chronic leukemia disease that exhibits an unexplained elevation in large granular lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. In order to better define the LGL leukemia pathogenesis, we propose an approach that combines the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and heat map visualization to detect possible biomarkers from a statistical perspective. In the research, we firstly classify our sample data into two classes: gene information from blood samples of normal donors and that of infected patients. We then apply the LASSO on the sample data for feature selection and dimension reduction to identify potential biomarkers. Based on our result, heat map visualization has revealed little information about possible biomarkers from the gene data, while the LASSO method shows promise in identifying biomarkers from over 10,000 candidate genes. Our final result shows that the method has successfully reduced the dimension of attributes to as low as 0.1% and has selected 21 features as potential biomarkers. Further analysis in the field of biomedical sciences is required to validate the relations between the potential biomarkers found and the LGL Leukemia disease.",2015,2015 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium

Molecular containers.,"This special issue on Molecular Containers is about molecules in small spaces, spaces barely big enough to accommodate them. The spaces are provided by unior multimolecular containers â€“ structures of various sizes, shapes and chemical surfaces â€“ that offer recognition features for the molecules held inside. The containers may be covalently bound and therefore permanent, or spontaneously assembled through metal/ligand interactions, hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic forces and more or less temporary. As in macroscopic architecture, the spaces provided by the molecular containers determine what goes inside and what goes on inside. The covalent or supramolecular nature of the container is key in controlling the dynamics by which molecules can enter and leave its inner space. The interactions between the container and the contained molecules are prearranged, prolonged and private: the shape of the space determines the arrangement of molecules inside. In the specific case of fully closed supramolecular containers or containers featuring only one narrow open end, the lifetime of the container defines the length of the encounters. The impermeable parts of these containers completely isolate the encapsulated molecules from the bulk solution. Containers with large portals allow the entrance and release of molecules without requiring a significant change in their structure. The surface of the included molecules is partially isolated from the solvent. In general, molecules inside containers behave quite differently from those in solution, where encounters are random, short-lived and constantly saturated by a swirling sea of solvent. When metal centers are incorporated in the cavities of the containers the catalytic properties are enhanced and modified compared to those expressed in the bulk. The differences in behavior are why we study molecules in containers: they comprise new conformations and stereochemical relationships; new reactions and accelerated old reactions; long-lived or stabilized â€˜â€˜reactiveâ€™â€™ intermediates, and catalysis. Some of these behaviors are familiar features of natureâ€™s container molecules, enzymes and receptors. They also surround their molecular targets, isolate them from the aqueous medium, place them in a shaped space for relatively long times and present them with functional groups. But, as we shall see, inside the synthetic containers there are phenomena unknown to biology or solution chemistry and molecular structures that cannot be seen any other way. Dariush Ajami, Lijuan Liu and Julius Rebek (DOI: 10.1039/c4cs00065j) report on reversibly formed containers and contained molecule shapes that are emergent. That is, neither exists independent of the other, but together they make stable complexes. They refer to these systems as â€˜â€˜soft templatesâ€™â€™. Kenji Kobayashi and Masamichi Yamanaka (DOI: 10.1039/c4cs00153b) trace the use of a popular module for molecular containers: calix[4]resorcinarenes. These molecules, introduced some 35 years ago, have provided the curvature for covalent, hydrogen-bonded, hydrophobic and metal/ ligand capsule shells. They include containers with large openings that permit parts of guest molecules to be inside and outside at the same time.

The arrangements expand the coordination spheres of the metals to a 3rd level, and place the catalytic ion in a hydrophobic environment, in spite of the surrounding water solvent.

A Gradient based algorithm for blind inversion of Wiener System using multi-variate score functions,"Signal Processing Group, Universitat de Vic, Sagrada FamÂ´ilia 7, 08500, Vic, Spainmbzadeh@yahoo.com, jordi.sole@uvic.es, Christian.Jutten@inpg.frABSTRACTA Wiener system is a linear time-invariant ï¬lter,followed by an invertible nonlinear distortion. As-suming that the input signal is an independent andidentically distributed (iid) sequence, we proposean algorithm for estimating the input signal onlyby observing the output of the Wiener system. Thealgorithm is based on minimizing the mutual infor-mation of the output samples, by means of a steep-est descent gradient approach.1. INTRODUCTIONWhen linear models fail, nonlinear models are power-ful tools for modeling practical situations. Many re-searches have been done in the identiï¬cation and/orthe inversion of nonlinear systems. These works usu-ally assume that both the input and the output of thedistortion are available, and are based on higher-orderinput/outputcross-correlation [1] or on the applicationof the Bussgang and Prices theorems [2, 3] for nonlin-ear systems with Gaussian inputs. However, in a realworld situation, one often does not have access to thedistortion input. In this case, the blind identiï¬cationof the nonlinearity becomes the only way to solve theproblem. This paper is concerned by a particular classof nonlinear systems, composed by a linear subsystemfollowed by a memoryless nonlinear distortion (seeFig. 1). This class of nonlinearsystems, also known asWiener systems, is a nice and mathematically attract-ing model, but also an actual model used in variousareas, such as biology [4], industry [5], sociology andpsychology (see also [6] and the references therein).Despite its interest, at our knowledge, it only exist two",2003,

By adopting fused LASSO, one can deal continuous as well as discrete variables in a unified framework. For computational efficiency, we develop a penalization path algorithm. Through numerical examples, we compare the performances of fused LASSO and LASSO with dummy variable coding.",2015,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
L1-Norm Support Vector Machine for the Classication of Highly Imbalanced Data,"Abstract The support vector machine has been successfully applied to various classiï¬cation areas due to its ï¬‚exibilityand a high level of classiï¬cation accuracy. However, when analyzing imbalanced data with uneven classsizes, the classiï¬cation accuracy of SVM may drop signiï¬cantly in predicting minority class because theSVM classiï¬ers are undesirably biased toward the majority class. The weighted L 2 -norm SVM was devel-oped for the analysis of imbalanced data; however, it cannot identify irrelevant input variables due to thecharacteristics of the ridge penalty. Therefore, we propose the weighted L 1 -norm SVM, which uses lassopenalty to select important input variables and weights to diï¬€erentiate the misclassiï¬cation of data pointsbetween classes. We demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed method through simulationstudies and a real data analysis.Keywords: Imbalanced data, lasso, linear programming, ridge, support vector machine. 1. ì„œë¡  ë²”ì£¼í˜• ìžë£Œì— ëŒ€í•œ ë¶„ë¥˜ë¶„ì„(classi cation analysis)ì€ì‹¤ìƒí™œì˜ë§Žì€ë¶„ì•¼ì—ì„œìœ ìš©í•˜ê²Œ í™œìš©ë˜ê³  ìžˆë‹¤. ì˜ˆë¥¼ ë“¤ì–´, ë¶„ë¥˜ë¶„ì„ì€ì˜ë£Œë¶„ì•¼ì—ì„œí™˜ìžê°€ íŠ¹ì • ì•”ì— ê±¸ë¦´ ê°€ëŠ¥ì„±ì„ì§„ë‹¨í•˜ê±°ë‚˜ íš¨ê³¼ì ì¸ì¹˜ë£Œë²•ì„íŒë‹¨í•˜ëŠ”ë° í™œìš©ë˜ê³ , ê¸ˆìœµë¶„ì•¼ì—ì„œì€í–‰ì˜ì—¬ì‹ ë‹´ë‹¹ìžê°€ ëŒ€ì¶œìžì˜ëŒ€ì¶œ ì—¬ë¶€ ê²°ì •í•˜ëŠ”ë° ì´ìš©ë˜ë©°, í†µì‹ ë¶„ì•¼ì—ì„œëŠ” ì´ë™í†µì‹  ê³ ê°ì˜ìœ ì§€ ë˜ëŠ” ì´íƒˆ ì—¬ë¶€ë¥¼ íŒë³„í•˜ëŠ”ë° í™œìš©ë˜ëŠ” ë“±ì˜ì‚¬ê²°ì •ì„í•„ìš”ë¡œí•˜ëŠ” ë§Žì€ë¶„ì•¼ì—ì„œê·¸ í™œìš©ì„±ì´ì§€ì†ì ìœ¼ë¡œ ì¦ê°€í•˜ê³  ìžˆë‹¤.

High midday temperature stress has stronger effects on biomass than on photosynthesis: A mesocosm experiment on four tropical seagrass species,"The effect of repeated midday temperature stress on the photosynthetic performance and biomass production of seagrass was studied in a mesocosm setup with four common tropical species, including Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea serrulata, Enhalus acoroides, and Thalassodendron ciliatum. To mimic natural conditions during low tides, the plants were exposed to temperature spikes of different maximal temperatures, that is, ambient (29-33Â°C), 34, 36, 40, and 45Â°C, during three midday hours for seven consecutive days. At temperatures of up to 36Â°C, all species could maintain full photosynthetic rates (measured as the electron transport rate, ETR) throughout the experiment without displaying any obvious photosynthetic stress responses (measured as declining maximal quantum yield, Fv/Fm). All species except T.Â ciliatum could also withstand 40Â°C, and only at 45Â°C did all species display significantly lower photosynthetic rates and declining Fv/Fm. Biomass estimation, however, revealed a different pattern, where significant losses of both above- and belowground seagrass biomass occurred in all species at both 40 and 45Â°C (except for C.Â serrulata in the 40Â°C treatment). Biomass losses were clearly higher in the shoots than in the belowground root-rhizome complex. The findings indicate that, although tropical seagrasses presently can cope with high midday temperature stress, a few degrees increase in maximum daily temperature could cause significant losses in seagrass biomass and productivity.",2018,Ecology and Evolution
LASSO multi-objective learning algorithm for feature selection,"This work proposes a new algorithm for training neural networks to solve the problems of feature selection and function approximation. The algorithm applies different weight constraint functions for the hidden and the output layers of a multilayer perceptron neural network. The LASSO operator is applied to the hidden layer; therefore, the training provides automatic selection of relevant features and the standard norm regularization function is applied to the output layer. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective training algorithm that is able to select the important features while solving the approximation problem.",2020,
RÃ©seau social et accÃ¨s aux ressources dans la trajectoire d'entreprises informelles: rÃ©cits de vie d'entrepreneurs Ã  Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina-Faso),"This paper analyzes the evolution and transformation of social relations and networks of access to resources during the professional career of micro entrepreneurs in the informal African urban economy. Our analysis of social networks fits in the â€˜structural embeddednessâ€™ framework of Granovetter (1985) associated with a dynamic perspective of social relations. This perspective allows taking into account the temporal dimension of embeddedness, and its links with others social mediations, as communities, organizations and formal institutions. With such a view, embeddedness is analyzed with its reverse, the decoupling that is to say how actors and structures become independent from social relations (White, 1992). From a methodological standpoint, our analysis of life-stories of micro and small entrepreneurs of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina-Faso) combines qualitative and quantitative methods. It suggests that social networks and interpersonal relations of access to resources are constructed through a long-time process. Thus they can not be so easily and quickly mobilized by the entrepreneurs as it is sometimes suggested in social capital approaches. We then observe a co-construction phenomenon of social networks and activity that undermine the view of social capital as a substitute for lack of personal resources. The development and resilience of micro and small activities are directly linked to the professionalization and the stabilization of the network; and even the institutionalization of access to resources. However, it should not mask strong inequalities among entrepreneurs according to their initial social network and the dynamic of their business environment.",2010,
"Prophecy, Harmony, And The Alchemical Transformation Of The Soul: The Key To Lassoâ€™s Chromatic Sibyls","Orlando di Lassos Latin motet cycle Prophetiae Sibyllarum is an enduring puzzle of the Renaissance repertoire. More than a century after its discovery, the Sibyl cycles unusually pervasive chromaticism, uncommon subject, unique texts, and unconfirmed provenance continue to challenge our music-theoretical assumptions, and thwart the attempts to situate the work within the context of sixteenth-century musical culture. Peter Bergquists identification of the Italian humanist source of Lassos Latin Sibyl poems and their subsequent print history is foremost among such work. This chapter identifies new source for the Prophetiae Sibyllarums texts and the ramifications of that discovery are explored in terms of a viable speaker for the prologue, a new interpretation of the chromatic harmony, and a proposed original audience and performance context for the work.The study of Sibylline Tradition and its relationship to the cultural context of Barbieris treatise has, however, revealed an earlier source of the poems.

Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation of Idiopathic Right Ventricular Tract Tachycardia Guided by Ring Mapping Catheter,"To evaluate the efficacy of ring mapping catheter (Lasso) guided radiofrequency catheter ablation of idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia (RVOT-VT),six patients (male 4, female 2, 35.0Â±6.0 years old) with idiopathic RVOT-VT underwent conventional electrophysiological study and ring mapping catheter guided radiofrequency catheter ablation. RVOT was mapped by ring catheter. The earliest local activation site during ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular premature contraction (VPC) was identified by ring catheter and then pace mapping was performed by ablation catheter during sinus rhythm to further determine the target for radiofrequency catheter ablation.Results: VTs originated from RVOT septum in five patients,including from free wall in one patient. All VTs and VPCs were ablated successfully (successful rate was 100%).Conclusion: Ring mapping catheter is helpful in identifying the origins of VTs or VPCs and can save mapping and ablation time.",2005,The Chinese Journal of Cardiac Pacing and Electrophysiology
Time and Ground,"In his 2006 After Finitude, Quentin Meillassoux presents a striking and far-reaching critique of what he calls correlationism: the view that there is no epistemological access to being as it is in itself, but only knowledge of being as it is for us. On the basis of his refutation of this doctrine, he comes to propose what he takes to be the fundamental principle of rational ontology: that there is no reason why things are the way they are, and they can change at any point, equally for no reason. â€œTime and Groundâ€ argues that this principle of unreason elaborated by Meillassoux cannot be as fundamental as he claims, because all change and stasis presupposes a more profound temporal order.",2012,Angelaki

Authorsâ€™ reply Our responses to the queries raised are as follows: 1. Our rationale for this study was to emphasise the effectiveness of bone marrow injection for delayed/non-unions, prior to considering bone grafting. We showed that bone marrow injection worked for almost all long bones, including metacarpals. Three injections of low volume (~30 ml) were as effective as a large volume (100â€“150 ml) of one-off injection,1,2 and it does not dilute the concentration of osteoblasts. 2. Fracture non-unions of stable configurations were included. No or minimal mobility at the site of non-union was expected. Fractures that were very unstable or with angular deformity and shortening were excluded, as were open fractures and infected non-unions. Informed consent was obtained from each patient. 3. We were aware of the paper by Galasso et al.3 on platelet-rich plasma and the paper by Hakimi et al.4 about the supplementary role of plateletrich plasma with bone grafting for treatment of non-unions. The paper of Griffin et al.5 was not available at the time of acceptance of our paper. Despite that, studies on the use of platelet-rich plasma alone for treatment of non-unions remain limited. 4. Patients were followed up (at 4â€“6 weeks interval) radiographically and clinically to decide on the need to proceed to the 2nd and 3rd injections. 5. These were cases of atrophic non-union, where biology rather than mechanical instability at the fracture site was the reason for failed union. Hence, immobilising the fracture site (other than for comfort) was deemed unnecessary. Therefore, patients were allowed to mobilise as comfort allowed. 6. In our experience, bone marrow injections work well in atrophic non-unions where fracture biology was the reason for failed union. Hence, for unstable or hypertrophc non-unions they may not have any role. Fractures that are very unstable or with angular deformity and shortening constitute contraindications to this procedure.",2011,International Journal of Ayurveda Research
Information-theoretic limits on sparsity recovery in the high-dimensional and noisy setting,"The problem of sparsity pattern or support set recovery refers to estimating the set of nonzero coefficients of an unknown vector beta* isin Ropfp based on a set of n noisy observations. It arises in a variety of settings, including subset selection in regression, graphical model selection, signal denoising, compressive sensing, and constructive approximation. The sample complexity of a given method for subset recovery refers to the scaling of the required sample size n as a function of the signal dimension p, sparsity index k (number of non-zeroes in beta*), as well as the minimum value betamin of beta* over its support and other parameters of measurement matrix. This paper studies the information-theoretic limits of sparsity recovery: in particular, for a noisy linear observation model based on random measurement matrices drawn from general Gaussian measurement matrices, we derive both a set of sufficient conditions for exact support recovery using an exhaustive search decoder, as well as a set of necessary conditions that any decoder, regardless of its computational complexity, must satisfy for exact support recovery. This analysis of fundamental limits complements our previous work on sharp thresholds for support set recovery over the same set of random measurement ensembles using the polynomial-time Lasso method (lscr1-constrained quadratic programming).",2009,IEEE Trans.

On gene Selection and Classification for Cancer microarray Data Using Multi-Step Clustering and Sparse Representation,"Microarray data profiles gene expression on a whole genome scale, and provides a good way to study associations between gene expression and occurrence or progression of cancer disease. Many researchers realized that microarray data is useful to predict cancer cases. However, the high dimension of gene expressions, which is significantly larger than the sample size, makes this task very difficult. It is very important to identify the significant genes causing cancer. Many feature selection algorithms have been proposed focusing on improving cancer predictive accuracy at the expense of ignoring the correlations between the features. In this work, a novel framework (named by SGS) is presented for significant genes selection and efficient cancer case classification. The proposed framework first performs a clustering algorithm to find the gene groups where genes in each group have higher correlation coefficient, and then selects (1) the significant (2) genes in each group using the Bayesian Lasso method and important gene groups using the group Lasso method, and finally builds a prediction model based on the shrinkage gene space with efficient classification algorithm (such as support vector machine (SVM), 1NN, and regression). Experimental results on public available microarray data show that the proposed framework often outperforms the existing feature selection and prediction methods such as SAM, information gain (IG), and Lasso-type prediction models.",2011,Advances in Adaptive Data Analysis
Deep learning applied to glacier evolution modelling,"Abstract. We present a novel approach to simulate and reconstruct annual glacier-wide surface mass balance (SMB) series based on a deep artificial neural network (ANN; i.e. deep learning). This method has been included as the SMB component of an open-source regional glacier evolution model. While most glacier models tend to incorporate more and more physical processes, here we take an alternative approach by creating a parameterized model based on data science. Annual glacier-wide SMBs can be simulated from topo-climatic predictors using either deep learning or Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; regularized multilinear regression), whereas the glacier geometry is updated using a glacier-specific parameterization. We compare and cross-validate our nonlinear deep learning SMB model against other standard linear statistical methods on a dataset of 32 French Alpine glaciers. Deep learning is found to outperform linear methods, with improved explained variance (up to +64 â€‰% in space and +108 â€‰% in time) and accuracy (up to +47 â€‰% in space and +58 â€‰% in time), resulting in an estimated r2 of 0.77 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.51â€‰mâ€‰w.e. Substantial nonlinear structures are captured by deep learning, with around 35â€‰% of nonlinear behaviour in the temporal dimension. For the glacier geometry evolution, the main uncertainties come from the ice thickness data used to initialize the model. These results should encourage the use of deep learning in glacier modelling as a powerful nonlinear tool, capable of capturing the nonlinearities of the climate and glacier systems, that can serve to reconstruct or simulate SMB time series for individual glaciers in a whole region for past and future climates.",2020,The Cryosphere
Laparoscopically assisted simple suturing obliteration (LASSO) of the internal ring using an epidural needle: a handy single-port laparoscopic herniorrhaphy in children.,"BACKGROUND
Many different laparoscopic techniques for pediatric inguinal hernia (PIH) have been developed, with a trend toward increasing use of extracorporeal knotting and decreasing use of working ports. Single-port laparoscopic percutaneous extraperitoneal closure is one of the most simple and reliable methods. We describe our modifications of laparoscopically assisted simple suturing obliteration (LASSO) using an epidural needle with preperitoneal hydrodissection.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Two hundred and seven patients with PIH were treated with single-port LASSO from February 2010 to July 2013. Under laparoscopic visualization, an 18-gauge epidural needle was inserted at the corresponding point of the internal ring. The hernia defect was obliterated extraperitoneally by a nonabsorbable suture that was introduced into the abdomen on one side and withdrawn on the opposite side in an identical subcutaneous path around the internal ring using the hydrodissection-lasso technique.


RESULTS
A total of 251 PIHs were successfully performed by LASSO, 163 patients had unilateral inguinal hernia repair, and 44 patients underwent repair of bilateral inguinal hernias. Mean operating time for unilateral and bilateral inguinal hernia repairs was 18.1Â±5.4min and 26.6Â±4.8min, respectively. There were no perioperative complications. Only one recurrence was observed to date.


CONCLUSIONS
LASSO using an epidural needle with preperitoneal hydrodissection as a handy technique has proved to be a safe and effective procedure. It is easy to perform with high parent satisfaction, invisible scarring, and good cosmetic results, and therefore is a worthy choice for PIH.",2014,Journal of pediatric surgery
"Wallenberg Categorization of gender , modulated by experience , can constrain coreference 11 : 10 â€“ 11 : 50","Spaghetti-shaped curves Anton Karl Ingason Linguistic change often involves a regular s-curve and it is common to assume that the sshaped curve reflects some deep reality about the ways in which the use of linguistic variants spreads. As an example of the status of the mathematically well-behaved curve, Yang's Variational Model of language acquisition can be applied to calculate the expected usage trajectory of an ongoing change into the future. This method has, for example, been used to predict how Icelandic children will acquire and use an innovative new passive construction until the year 2050. However, not all change is that regular and in this talk I will focus on aspects of individual lifespan change that highlight a certain type of case where the assumption of a neat curve is not valid. While individual lifespan change is sometimes regular, such regularity is really caused by systematic reactions of speakers to changes in the community. I will thus distinguish community-specific lifespan change from individualspecific lifespan change and show that when the factors that shape usage over time cannot be generalized over communities, usage patterns can change rapidly in reaction to idiosyncratic events in the life of a speaker. I present a study of the use of Icelandic Stylistic Fronting in the parliament speeches of SteingrÃ­mur SigfÃºsson, former finance minister of Iceland. This study comes from joint work with Lilja BjÃ¶rk StefÃ¡nsdÃ³ttir. Stylistic Fronting is an optional syntactic movement process associated with formal style and we tracked its use in 8005 tokens collected from 23 continuous years of a political career. At first sight, the usage rate over time seems to fluctuate irregularly, but two crucial aspects of our methodology allow us to account for its development. First, the high time resolution of the study allows us to see when exactly important changes take place. Second, by carrying out a thorough interview with the research subject, we were able to enhance the quantitative findings with the qualitative depth needed to understand what was happening in any given year. One conclusion of this work is that studies of individual-lifespan change demand a high time resolution as well as an emphasis on qualitative depth because individual-specific factors can overrule systematic reactions to community-specific factors. Another one is that while simple s-curves are to be expected when the crucial parts of reality generalize over communities, individuals are sometimes more complicated than communities, giving rise to spaghetti-shaped curves. Intonational Variation, Pragmatics, and Social Meaning: Critical Evidence from African American Language Nicole Holliday Over the past 50 years, great strides have been made towards more comprehensive understandings of ethnolinguistic, pragmatic, and intonational variation, but research at the intersection of these subfields is still largely absent from modern sociolinguistics. This research aims to address that lacuna by examining the ways in which the meanings of intonational contours appear to differ between two varieties of American English, Mainstream U.S. English (MUSE) and African American Language (AAL). By challenging previous theories of the discourse-pragmatic meaning of various intonational contours, which have largely focused on white-speakers of MUSE to the exclusion of all others, this research expands our understanding of the nature of the intonational phonology of English. I will demonstrate that AAL may accomplish pragmatic functions related to declarative statements and polar questions in manners not predicted by earlier MUSE-based theories of the meaning of specific intonational contours. These results also illuminate the ways in which the assumptions of these earlier theories may be challenged by empirical data from AAL and other varieties, encouraging us to seek a more sociolinguistically-informed understanding of the variation possible in English intonation. The research also sheds further light on the ways in which interactions between speakers of MUSE and speakers of AAL may present challenges similar to those in other cross-cultural communication situations. Finally, I will highlight the social effects and consequences for speakers who do not participate in MUSE intonational patterns, especially those which can include difficultly interacting with hegemonic power systems such as education, criminal justice, and capitalistic markets. Via this analysis and discussion, I hope to highlight the ways in which an understanding of intonational variation is crucial for addressing issues of linguistic profiling, discrimination, and inequality. Categorization of gender, modulated by experience, can constrain coreference Lauren Ackerman (lauren.ackerman@ncl.ac.uk) and Joel Wallenberg, Newcastle University English does not have grammatical gender, but it encodes something about conventional or natural gender in 3rd person singular pronouns, names, and gendered nouns (Baron, 1971; Barry & Harper, 1982, 1993, 2001, Kennison & Trofe, 2003, a.o.). Yet, natural gender is not biologically or socially binary, which is increasing in public awareness (Atkinson et al., 2017; Cheshire, 2002; Eckert, 2014; Gross, 2016; Gustafsson SendÃ©n et al., 2015; Miltersen, 2016). This study investigates how individual differences modulate the linguistic processing of gender. We suggest that while the categorical representation of gender is difficult to alter, it interfaces actively with real-world knowledge of gender variation, and so affects sentence acceptability. Linguistically encoded natural gender is used by psycholinguists to probe coreference dependency formation via the â€œgender mismatch effectâ€ (GMME). A GMME, inferred from a slowdown in reading time, is detected when a â€˜genderedâ€™ name or noun is grammatically accessible for coreference with a pronoun of mismatched gender (Kazanina et al., 2007; Sturt, 2003; van Gompel and Liversedge, 2003, a.o.). (1) # Johnâ€‹iâ€‹ seemed to be upset with herself â€‹iâ€‹. In (1), â€‹herselfâ€‹ is linked to â€‹John â€‹ by means of a grammatically constrained coreference relation, so readers struggle to link these words once the gender is determined to mismatch, herein indicated by â€˜#â€™ (Chomsky, 1981; Foertsch and Gernsbacher, 1997; Sanford and Filik, 2007; van Gompel and Liversedge, 2003). However, natural gender is not grammatically constrained, demonstrated by specific pragmatic contexts, as in (2). (2) âœ“ At the Halloween party, the cowgirl â€‹iâ€‹ left his â€‹iâ€‹ lasso prop in the kitchen. As nonbinary genders become more widely acknowledged, understanding how natural or conventional gender is represented by the linguistic processing mechanism will be crucial for investigating processing phenomena that use GMMEs to detect grammatical phenomena. Seventy-two native speakers of English were recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk to rate the â€˜naturalnessâ€™ of sentences on a 7-point scale, provide implicit and explicit measures of their gender identity/expression (BSRI; Bem, 1981a,b) and other demographic information. Of the demographic data collected, the strongest predictor of acceptability ratings for mismatched name+pronoun gender was â€‹ageâ€‹ (r=-0.33, p<0.01), with younger participants rating mismatched pairs higher than older participants (Estimate=0.06, SE=0.01, LR.stat(1)=26.1,p<0.001). Neither age nor quantitative measures of gender correlated with the ratings of non-mismatched pairs (p<0.1). We propose that the representation of natural gender in English pronouns does not contain formal syntactic features, but instead is categorized in a conceptual space based on real-world experience. The interaction between the representation of natural gender and the processing of coreference relations can vary based on the way the continuous dimension of gender is categorized. Our results suggest that older speakers and younger speakers have slightly different category means based on their differing experience of gender variation. Both still effectuate a linguistic binary due to their bimodal categorization of continuous gender, but the differences in overlap between â€œmaleâ€ and â€œfemaleâ€ categories produce different acceptability judgments in a stochastic manner. Thus, older and younger speakers show the same broad patterns of grammaticality, but have a significant difference in their acceptance of non-conventional name-gender pairs.",2017,
Attack against Emile Zola,"sharply with the rarefied prose and alienated spirit of the younger generation of Symbolist writers. The eminent Naturalist author counseled these writers against the meandering, elegant lines that disguised their skepticism and urged them to express directly their indignation with the age: just ""say shit to the century.""' The most notoriously maligned but nevertheless most popular writer of his day, Zola certainly knew of what he spoke. Not only was his fiction steeped in intimate physiological and salacious sexual detail, but his own public image, especially that established in popular caricature, had itself become synonymous with scatology. Indeed, after Sarah Bernhardt, the well-known actress of the period, Zola held the dubious distinction of being the most caricatured person in late nineteenth-century France. He actually relished the mocking attacks made on him.2 In fact, Zola's own comment about his addiction to insults from the press is peppered throughout the critical writing about him. From the appearance of his first successful novel LAssommoir in 1876 through his journalistic campaign in defense of Alfred Dreyfus, Zola's distinctive face and corpulent body had become the continual brunt of the caricaturist's crayon. And a sizable portion of these images specifically associated Zola with sex, dirt, and excrement. The aggravated vehemence and vulgarity of an already bombastic press resulted directly from the radically revised 1881 laws governing France's fourth estate. A reaction to years of restrictions and censorship, the new journalistic freedoms made litigation for libel nearly impossible for virtually any spurious journalism either written or drawn.4 In fact, the French press during the last two decades of the nineteenth century may have been the most open and the most sensational of any Western nation during the modern era.

A novel genomic-clinicopathologic nomogram to improve prognosis prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"There is a lack of precise and clinical accessible model to predict the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in clinic practice currently. Here, an inclusive nomogram was developed by integrating genomic markers and clinicopathologic factors for predicting the outcome of patients with HCC. A total of 365 samples of HCC were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The LASSO analysis was carried out to identify HCC-related mRNAs, and the multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to construct a genomic-clinicopathologic nomogram. As results, 9 mRNAs were finally identified as prognostic indicators, including RGCC, CDH15, XRN2, RAB3IL1, THEM4, PIF1, MANBA, FKTN and GABARAPL1, and used to establish a 9-mRNA classifier. Additionally, an inclusive nomogram was built up by combining the 9-mRNA classifier (P < 0.001) and clinicopathologic factors including age (P = 0.006) and metastasis (P < 0.001) to predict the mortality of HCC patients. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic, index of concordance and calibration analyses indicated favorable accuracy of the model. Decision curve analysis suggested that appropriate intervention according to the established nomogram will bring net benefit when threshold probability was above 25%. The genomic-clinicopathologic model could be a reliable tool for predicting the mortality, helping determining the individualized treatment and probably improving HCC survival.",2020,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry
Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Structured Sparse Logistic Regression and Three-Dimensional Wavelet Texture Features,"Hyperspectral remote sensing imagery contains rich information on spectral and spatial distributions of distinct surface materials. Owing to its numerous and continuous spectral bands, hyperspectral data enable more accurate and reliable material classification than using panchromatic or multispectral imagery. However, high-dimensional spectral features and limited number of available training samples have caused some difficulties in the classification, such as overfitting in learning, noise sensitiveness, overloaded computation, and lack of meaningful physical interpretability. In this paper, we propose a hyperspectral feature extraction and pixel classification method based on structured sparse logistic regression and 3-D discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) texture features. The 3D-DWT decomposes a hyperspectral data cube at different scales, frequencies, and orientations, during which the hyperspectral data cube is considered as a whole tensor instead of adapting the data to a vector or matrix. This allows the capture of geometrical and statistical spectral-spatial structures. After the feature extraction step, sparse representation/modeling is applied for data analysis and processing via sparse regularized optimization, which selects a small subset of the original feature variables to model the data for regression and classification purpose. A linear structured sparse logistic regression model is proposed to simultaneously select the discriminant features from the pool of 3D-DWT texture features and learn the coefficients of the linear classifier, in which the prior knowledge about feature structure can be mapped into the various sparsity-inducing norms such as lasso, group, and sparse group lasso. Furthermore, to overcome the limitation of linear models, we extended the linear sparse model to nonlinear classification by partitioning the feature space into subspaces of linearly separable samples. The advantages of our methods are validated on the real hyperspectral remote sensing data sets.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing
An Evaluation of Parameter Pruning Approaches for Software Estimation,"Model-based estimation often uses impact factors and historical data to predict the effort of new projects. Estimation accuracy of this approach is highly dependent on how well impact factors are selected. This paper comparatively assesses six methods for prune parameters of effort estimation models, including Stepwise regression, Lasso, constrained regression, GRASP, Tabu search, and PCA. Four data sets were used for evaluation, showing that estimation accuracy varies among the methods but no method consistently outperforms the rest. Stepwise regression prunes estimation model parameters the most while it does not sacrifice much estimation performance. Our study provides further evidence to support the use of Stepwise regression for selecting factors in effort estimation.",2019,Proceedings of the Fifteenth International Conference on Predictive Models and Data Analytics in Software Engineering
Ill-posed Estimation in High-Dimensional Models with Instrumental Variables,"This paper is concerned with inference about low-dimensional components of a high-dimensional parameter vector beta_0 which is identified through in- strumental variables. We allow for eigenvalues of the expected outer product of included and excluded covariates, denoted by M, to shrink to zero as the sample size increases. We propose a novel estimator based on desparsi- fication of an instrumental variable Lasso estimator, which is a regularized version of 2SLS with an additional correction term. This estimator converges to beta_0 at a rate depending on the mapping properties of M captured by a sparse link condition. Linear combinations of our estimator of beta_0 are shown to be asymptotically normally distributed. Based on consistent covariance estimation, our method allows for constructing confidence intervals and sta- tistical tests for single or low-dimensional components of beta_0. In Monte-Carlo simulations we analyze the finite sample behavior of our estimator.",2018,arXiv: Econometrics
"Biomolecular free energy profiles by a shooting/umbrella sampling protocol, ""BOLAS"".","We develop an efficient technique for computing free energies corresponding to conformational transitions in complex systems by combining a Monte Carlo ensemble of trajectories generated by the shooting algorithm with umbrella sampling. Motivated by the transition path sampling method, our scheme ""BOLAS"" (named after a cowboy's lasso) preserves microscopic reversibility and leads to the correct equilibrium distribution. This makes possible computation of free energy profiles along complex reaction coordinates for biomolecular systems with a lower systematic error compared to traditional, force-biased umbrella sampling protocols. We demonstrate the validity of BOLAS for a bistable potential, and illustrate the method's scope with an application to the sugar repuckering transition in a solvated deoxyadenosine molecule.",2004,The Journal of chemical physics

Stock market prediction using social media data and finding the covariance of the LASSO,"Stock market prediction has been a research topic for decades; recently, efforts to increase the accuracy by including data from social media like Google and Twitter received a lot of attention. Social media can be regarded as indicator for sentiments and sentiments are known to influence the stock market. Current models lack interpretation; it is difficult to determine what data is relevant for stock market prediction, since there is an abundance of social media data. A regression method that induces sparsity is thus required; data that is not useful is discarded automatically. The LASSO induces sparsity via L1-regularization; however, the covariance and confidence of the found regression coefficients cannot be derived easily, while this is important for interpretation. This thesis therefore reviews all known methods for approximating the covariance and confidence interval for the LASSO and determines their accuracy using numerical simulations. A new method is proposed based on the Unscented Transform, which outcompetes all methods in the underdetermined scenario, where there are more features than data points. Unfortunately, linear regression via the LASSO has limited use for stock markets as the achieved prediction accuracy is low. Nonlinear models are often applied for stock market prediction to achieve higher accuracies. Therefore a new feature selection method is proposed for the nonlinear Support Vector Regression (SVR) to select the correct data for stock market prediction using the SVR. This method yields accurate feature selection when the number of features to select from is low.",2014,
Development and validation of a radiomics nomogram for progression-free survival prediction in stage IV EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer,"Accurately predict the risk of disease progression and benefit of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with activing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations by current staging methods are challenge. We postulated that integrating a classifier consisted of multiple computed tomography (CT) phenotypic features, and other clinicopathological risk factors into a single model could improve risk stratification and prediction of progression-free survival (PFS) of EGFR TKIs for these patients. Patients confirmed as stage IV EGFR-mutant NSCLC received EGFR TKIs with no resection; pretreatment contrast enhanced CT performed at approximately 2 weeks before the treatment was enrolled. A six-CT-phenotypic-feature-based classifier constructed by the LASSO Cox regression model, and three clinicopathological factors: pathologic N category, performance status (PS) score, and intrapulmonary metastasis status were used to construct a nomogram in a training set of 115 patients. The prognostic and predictive accuracy of this nomogram was then subjected to an external independent validation of 107 patients. PFS between the training and independent validation set is no statistical difference by Mann-Whitney U test (P = 0.2670). PFS of the patients could be predicted with good consistency compared with the actual survival. C-index of the proposed individualized nomogram in the training set (0Â·707, 95%CI: 0Â·643, 0Â·771) and the independent validation set (0Â·715, 95%CI: 0Â·650, 0Â·780) showed the potential of clinical prognosis to predict PFS of stage IV EGFR-mutant NSCLC from EGFR TKIs. The individualized nomogram might facilitate patient counselling and individualise management of patients with this disease.",2017,
Pure additive contribution of genetic variants to a risk prediction model using propensity score matching: application to type 2 diabetes,"The achievements of genome-wide association studies have suggested ways to predict diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Most T2D risk prediction models have used SNPs in combination with demographic variables. However, it is difficult to evaluate the pure additive contribution of genetic variants to classically used demographic models. Since prediction models include some heritable traits, such as body mass index, the contribution of SNPs using unmatched case-control samples may be underestimated. In this article, we propose a method that uses propensity score matching to avoid underestimation by matching case and control samples, thereby determining the pure additive contribution of SNPs. To illustrate the proposed propensity score matching method, we used SNP data from the Korea Association Resources project and reported SNPs from the genome-wide association study catalog. We selected various SNP sets via stepwise logistic regression (SLR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and the elastic-net (EN) algorithm. Using these SNP sets, we made predictions using SLR, LASSO, and EN as logistic regression modeling techniques. The accuracy of the predictions was compared in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The contribution of SNPs to T2D was evaluated by the difference in the AUC between models using only demographic variables and models that included the SNPs. The largest difference among our models showed that the AUC of the model using genetic variants with demographic variables could be 0.107 higher than that of the corresponding model using only demographic variables.",2019,Genomics & Informatics

[The Initial Experience of Video-assisted Thoracic Surgery Segmentectomy for Early Stage Lung Cancer].,"BACKGROUND
Segmentectomy can retains more healthy lung tissue than lobectomy, but it remains controversial in oncology for early stage lung cancer. The aim of this study is to discuss the problems of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) segmentectomy in early stage lung cancer, by analyzing the clinical and pathological data of 35 cases and reviewing the literature.


METHODS
There were 35 patients who received segmentectomy by complete video-assisted thoracic surgery, from May 2013 to July 2017, in single operation group in the Third Hospital of Peking University. We analyzed the patient's clinical and pathological data, intraoperative and postoperative complications, lymph node number and metastasis its situation, and compared postoperative pathology and preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging type. In 35 cases of segmentectomy, there were 11 males and 24 females, with an average age of 57.7 years old. The lesions located in the right upper lobe were 8 cases, in the right lower lobe were 8 cases, in the left upper lobe were 13 cases, in the left lower lobe were 6 cases. The mean maximum diameter of CT imaging was 12.7 mm, and the largest diameter of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes was less than 10 mm. 23 of them were ground glass predominating and 12 were solid components predominating.


RESULTS
All 35 cases were successfully completed VATS anatomical segmentectomy. The average operation time was 153 minutes, the amount of bleeding was 51 mL. There were 10 cases of air leakage after operation, all of which were not more than 3 days. There was contralateral atelectasis in 1 case, chylothorax in 1 case. The average length of hospitalization was 6.1 days. There was no other complications outpatient related to surgery, in 30 days after discharge. The pathological changes were as follow, 2 cases of metastatic tumor, 8 cases of benign lung disease and 25 cases of primary lung cancer. In the 25 cases of primary lung cancer, there were 14 cases of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (7 cases were groundglassopacity (GGO) predominating in CT imaging), 4 cases of micro-invasive adenocarcinoma (3 cases were GGO predominating in CT imaging), 6 cases of adenocarcinoma in situ (all were pure GGO in CT imaging), 1 case of lung squamous cell carcinoma (mainly composed of solid in CT imaging). An average of 7.2 lymph nodes were removed in 25 cases of lung cancer, and all lymph nodes had no metastasis.


CONCLUSIONS
VATS anatomical segmentectomy is technically safe and reliable, and the indications for lung cancer need to be strictly controlled. Its advantages still need to be confirmed by prospective randomized controlled trials.",2018,Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer
Structured variable selection with q-values.,"When some of the regressors can act on both the response and other explanatory variables, the already challenging problem of selecting variables when the number of covariates exceeds the sample size becomes more difficult. A motivating example is a metabolic study in mice that has diet groups and gut microbial percentages that may affect changes in multiple phenotypes related to body weight regulation. The data have more variables than observations and diet is known to act directly on the phenotypes as well as on some or potentially all of the microbial percentages. Interest lies in determining which gut microflora influence the phenotypes while accounting for the direct relationship between diet and the other variables A new methodology for variable selection in this context is presented that links the concept of q-values from multiple hypothesis testing to the recently developed weighted Lasso.",2013,Biostatistics
Kernel based methods for accelerated failure time model with ultra-high dimensional data,"BackgroundMost genomic data have ultra-high dimensions with more than 10,000 genes (probes). Regularization methods with L1 and Lp penalty have been extensively studied in survival analysis with high-dimensional genomic data. However, when the sample size n â‰ª m (the number of genes), directly identifying a small subset of genes from ultra-high (m > 10, 000) dimensional data is time-consuming and not computationally efficient. In current microarray analysis, what people really do is select a couple of thousands (or hundreds) of genes using univariate analysis or statistical tests, and then apply the LASSO-type penalty to further reduce the number of disease associated genes. This two-step procedure may introduce bias and inaccuracy and lead us to miss biologically important genes.ResultsThe accelerated failure time (AFT) model is a linear regression model and a useful alternative to the Cox model for survival analysis. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear kernel based AFT model and an efficient variable selection method with adaptive kernel ridge regression. Our proposed variable selection method is based on the kernel matrix and dual problem with a much smaller n Ã— n matrix. It is very efficient when the number of unknown variables (genes) is much larger than the number of samples. Moreover, the primal variables are explicitly updated and the sparsity in the solution is exploited.ConclusionsOur proposed methods can simultaneously identify survival associated prognostic factors and predict survival outcomes with ultra-high dimensional genomic data. We have demonstrated the performance of our methods with both simulation and real data. The proposed method performs superbly with limited computational studies.",2010,BMC Bioinformatics
Educational Malpractice and the Sociopolitical Concerns of Language-Minority Students. (2001 Keynote Address),"ABSTRACT. This paper grows out of linguistic controversies surrounding educational proposals for English Language Learners and African American students that proved to be highly controversial and racially divisive. Within the past five years, Ron Unz, a successful software developer from California's Silicon Valley, put forward Proposition 227, called `English for the Children', which severely restricted educational choices for students who are not native English speakers. Mr. Unz has also exported his legislation, with mixed results, to Arizona, Colorado, New York, and other localities. Another educational controversy began in 1996, when the Oakland, California, School Board passed a controversial resolution claiming that Ebonics was the native language of all African American students within that school district. The school board eventually abandoned that effort, and they did so, unfortunately, before lending full clarity to the literacy and educational needs of African American students. After briefly reviewing these controversies and the underlying linguistic myths that gave rise to them, I draw analogies between medical malpractice and educational malpractice with respect to language minority populations. The vital role of linguistic expertise is explored, along with some of the sociopolitical influences that have constrained educational opportunities for the vast majority of minority students, particularly if they lack Standard English proficiency. More significantly to members of LASSO, the vital role of linguistic research for effective educational policies and teaching practices is explored in relationship to racially-motivated linguistic discrimination as gate-keeping devices in schools and other social institutions that lack significant racial diversity. This discussion also calls for a reclassification of language minority students and assurance that their educational choices are allowed to expand. * INTRODUCTION. Several years ago I co-directed a teacher education program at a major American research university, and case studies were made a central part of our student teacher preparation (see e.g. Shulman & Mesa-Bains 1994). That orientation grew out of an interest in the postgraduate professional training of physicians and attorneys. Doctors and lawyers are devoted to the welfare of clients who are served within a CASE. By contrast, the vast majority of teacher case studies are focused on teachers as the central unit of analysis rather than their clients, that is, their individual students. Having come to teacher education by way of linguistics, I was intrigued by this contrast in emphasis, and I sought to understand it. My primary research interests focus on the educational welfare of low income and language minority students. Although racial classifications of students who do not speak Standard English are common, high rates of poverty and limited educational opportunities account for a substantial portion of prevailing academic discrepancies. I propose here to extend the medical/legal analogy to matters of professional malpractice in educational contexts, particularly with respect to language minority children, or, more precisely, children who lack proficiency in Standard English. Although the remarks to follow are focused on the United States, and are devoted considerably to linguistic circumstances found within the Southwest, they can be applied more broadly and pertain to students who are not fluent speakers or writers of the dominant language(s) where they reside. 1. PERSONAL EXPOSURE Although it is rare for scholars to discuss their personal circumstances, the topic at hand is one that has affected me throughout my life. I am the son, and grandson, of lifelong public school teachers who decried many of the structural and regulatory constraints that prohibited them from advancing the educational welfare of their students, which, in the case of my family, includes students who attended urban schools in Philadelphia and Los Angeles. â€¦",2002,Southwest Journal of Linguistics
