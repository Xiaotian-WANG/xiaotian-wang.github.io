A decision-tree approach for the differential diagnosis of chronic lymphoid leukemias and peripheral B-cell lymphomas,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
Here we propose a decision-tree approach for the differential diagnosis of distinct WHO categories B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders using flow cytometry data. Flow cytometry is the preferred method for the immunophenotypic characterization of leukemia and lymphoma, being able to process and register multiparametric data about tens of thousands of cells per second.


METHODS
The proposed decision-tree is composed by logistic function nodes that branch throughout the tree into sets of (possible) distinct leukemia/lymphoma diagnoses. To avoid overfitting, regularization via the Lasso algorithm was used. The code can be run online at https://codeocean.com/2018/03/08/a-decision-tree-approach-for-the-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphoid-leukemias-and-peripheral-b-cell-lymphomas/ or downloaded from https://github.com/lauramoraes/bioinformatics-sourcecode to be executed in Matlab.


RESULTS
The proposed approach was validated in diagnostic peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from 283 mature lymphoid leukemias/lymphomas patients. The proposed approach achieved 95% correctness in the cross-validation test phase (100% in-sample), 61% giving a single diagnosis and 34% (possible) multiple disease diagnoses. Similar results were obtained in an out-of-sample validation dataset. The generated tree reached the final diagnoses after up to seven decision nodes.


CONCLUSIONS
Here we propose a decision-tree approach for the differential diagnosis of mature lymphoid leukemias/lymphomas which proved to be accurate during out-of-sample validation. The full process is accomplished through seven binary transparent decision nodes.",2019,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine
Identifying Genetic Risk Factors via Sparse Group Lasso with Group Graph Structure,"Genome-wide association studies (GWA studies or GWAS) investigate the relationships between genetic variants such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and individual traits. Recently, incorporating biological priors together with machine learning methods in GWA studies has attracted increasing attention. However, in real-world, nucleotide-level bio-priors have not been well-studied to date. Alternatively, studies at gene-level, for example, protein--protein interactions and pathways, are more rigorous and legitimate, and it is potentially beneficial to utilize such gene-level priors in GWAS. In this paper, we proposed a novel two-level structured sparse model, called Sparse Group Lasso with Group-level Graph structure (SGLGG), for GWAS. It can be considered as a sparse group Lasso along with a group-level graph Lasso. Essentially, SGLGG penalizes the nucleotide-level sparsity as well as takes advantages of gene-level priors (both gene groups and networks), to identifying phenotype-associated risk SNPs. We employ the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to optimize the proposed model. Our experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative whole genome sequence data and neuroimage data demonstrate the effectiveness of SGLGG. As a regression model, it is competitive to the state-of-the-arts sparse models; as a variable selection method, SGLGG is promising for identifying Alzheimer's disease-related risk SNPs.",2017,ArXiv
Thyroid hormone binding proteins as novel targets for hydroxylated polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAHs) : possible implications for toxicity,"Previous results from our laboratory indicated specific and competitive interactions of hydroxylated metabolites of 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl with the plasma thyroid hormone transport protein, transthyretin (TTR), in rats in vivo and with human TTR in vitro. In the present study the structural requirements for competition with thyroxine (T4) for TTR-binding were investigated in more detail. Several hydroxylated poly chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) were tested in an in vitro competitive binding assay, using purified human TTR and I-T4 as a displaceable radioligand. All hydroxylated PCBs, but not the single PCB tested, competitively displaced I-T4 from TTR with differential potency. The highest competitive binding potency was observed for hydroxylated PCB congeners with the hydroxygroup substituted on meta or para positions and one or more chlorine atoms substituted adjacent to the hydroxy-group on either or both aromatic rings (IC50 range 6.5 25 nM; Ka range: 0.78 3.95 * 10 8 M""). The relative potency of all meta or para hydroxylated PCBs was higher than that of the physiological ligand, T4 (relative potency range: 3.5 13.6 compared to T4). There were no marked distinctions in TTR-T4 competitive binding potencies between the orthoand non-orrto-chlorine substituted hydroxy-PCB congeners tested. Marked differences in TTR-T4 binding competition potency were observed between the limited number of hydroxylated PCDDs and PCDFs tested. The hydroxy-PCDD/Fs, with chlorine substitution adjacent to the hydroxy-group i.e., 7-OH-2,3,8-trichlorodibenzo-/?-dioxin, 2-OH-l,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 3-OH-2,6,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran, all showed a similar or higher relative binding potency, i.e. 1, 4.4 and 4.5 times higher respectively, than T4. No detectable I-T4 displacement was observed with 2-OH-7,8-dichlorodibenzofuran, 8-OH-2,3,4-trichlorodibenzofuran and 8-OH-2,3-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, which did not contain chlorine substitution adjacent to the OH-group. These results indicate a profound similarity in structural requirements for TTR binding between hydroxy-PCB, -PCDD and -PCDF metabolites and the physiological ligand, T4, e.g., halogen substitution adjacent to the para or meta hydroxy-group, while planarity does not seem to influence the ligand binding potency. Martine C. Lans, Eva Klasson-Wehler, Marcel Willemsen, Elise Meussen, Stephen Safe, and Abraham Brouwer 'Environmental Chemistry, Wallenberg Laboratory, Stockholm University, 10691 Stockholm, Sweden, department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology, A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA Chemico-Biological Interactions 8 8 , 7 2 1 (1993). 24 Interactions of OH-PHAHs with TTR in vitro Introduction Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofiirans (PCDFs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants that induce a broad spectrum of toxic signs and lesions in animals and man (McConnell, 1980). One aspect of the toxicity of these chemicals is their profound effect on thyroid hormone metabolism, which may play a role in the onset of certain toxic endpoints, such as the wasting syndrome, neurotoxicity and carcinogenicity. There are several reports on the interaction of halogenated biphenyls with thyroid hormone metabolism. Administration of, for instance, 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB) (Brouwer and Van den Berg, 1986) and 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (Spear et al., 1990) to rats caused changes in thyroid hormone metabolism and decreased plasma thyroxine (T4) levels. In addition, exposure to TCB is known to induce T4, but not triiodothyronine (T3) glucuronidation in rats (Beetstra et al., 1991). Exposure of marmoset monkeys to TCB caused hypothyroidism in these animals (Van den Berg et al, 1988). Rats treated with Aroclor 1254, a commercial PCB mixture, exhibited decreased T4 but no changes in T3 levels in serum and increased biliary T4 excretion was observed (Bastomsky, 1974). Saito et al. (1991) found that Kanechlor 400 also increased T4 glucuronidation in rats. Chronic exposure of rats to commercial PCB and polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) mixtures led to decreases in serum T3 and T4 levels and a decrease in the rate of T4 production which led to hypothyroidism (Byrne et al., 1987). Commercial PBB mixtures have also been reported to cause hypothyroidism in the mouse (Gupta et al, 1983). Moreover, changes in human serum T4 levels following exposure to PCBs or PBBs are described in several studies (Emmett et al., 1988; Murai et al, 1987; Bahn et al, 1980, Kreiss et al, 1982). Other related compounds, such as PCDDs and PCDFs are known to affect thyroid hormone metabolism in a similar way. For example, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzop-dioxin (TCDD) markedly increased the biliary excretion of T4 (Bastomsky, 1977). The increase in T4 excretion was most likely due to induction of T4 glucuronyltransferase activity by TCDD (Beetsta et al, 1991, Lucier et al., 1975). Administration of TCDD to rats resulted in reduced serum T4 levels but unchanged serum T3 levels (Potter et al., 1983). The induction of T4 glucuronidation by certain PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs may explain, in part, the hypothyroidism induced by these chemicals. However, Brouwer and Van den Berg (1986) have reported another possible pathway for the interaction of PCBs and related compounds with thyroid hormone metabolism. Hydroxylated metabolites of TCB have a marked structural resemblance to T4, the natural ligand for transthyretin (TTR), the major thyroid hormone transport protein in rat plasma. Due to this resemblance T4 could be specifically displaced from TTR by the hydroxylated metabolites, causing a decrease in plasma T4 levels. In the blood of rats administered TCB the TCB metabolite 4-OH-3,3',4',5-tetrachlorobiphenyl (4-OH-TCB) was identified (Brouwer, 1989). The metabolite exhibited strong binding affinity with TTR, thus decreasing in plasma T4 levels. Furthermore Rickenbacher et al. (1986) found that both PCBs and hydroxylated derivatives of PCBs competitively interacted with TTR, using computer modelling and in vitro binding studies. However, in other in vitro TTR-T4 competition studies it was shown that only hydroxylated metabolites of TCB, but not the parent compound were able to compete with T4 for binding to TTR (Brouwer et al., 1990). Similar results were",1995,
Efficient Algorithms for Selecting Features with Arbitrary Group Constraints via Group Lasso,"Feature structure information plays an important role for regression and classification tasks. We consider a more generic problem: group lasso problem, where structures over feature space can be represented as a combination of features in a group. These groups can be either overlapped or non-overlapped, which are specified in different structures, e.g., structures over a line, a tree, a graph or even a forest. We propose a new approach to solve this generic group lasso problem, where certain features are selected in a group, and an arbitrary family of subset is allowed. We employ accelerated proximal gradient method to solve this problem, where a key step is solve the associated proximal operator. We propose a fast method to compute the proximal operator, where its convergence is rigorously proved. Experimental results on different structures (e.g., group, tree, graph structures) demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",2013,2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining
[Assessing severe maternal anemia and its consequences: the value of a simple examination of the coloration of palpebral conjunctiva].,"The aims of this study were: (1) to investigate the relationship between pre-delivery hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and the outcome of the pregnancy for the mother and child and (2) to assess the extent to which the pallor of the conjunctiva indicates severe anemia in pregnancy (Hb < 7 g/dl). We carried out a prospective study in 1995, in the maternity department of the National SourÃ´ Sanou Hospital (Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso). Women arriving to give birth at the maternity unit gave verbal consent and underwent a physical examination including the assessment of conjunctiva coloration. Finger-prick blood samples were taken from all the women selected and Hb was determined with a portable hemoglobin meter (HemoCue AB, Sweden). For each woman, information about age, obstetric history, the condition of mother and child at admission and delivery and any post-delivery complications in the first 48 hours was collected before discharge from the maternity unit, 3 to 5 days after the delivery. Women with multiple pregnancies were excluded from the study and 247 women were included overall. Endometriosis was observed in only three cases. Three women died, two due to septic shock. The third woman died from hypovolemic shock. The Hb concentrations of these women were 8 g/dl, 10.2 g/dl and 2.6 g/dl respectively. The mean Hb concentration for our population was 10.1 g/dl (SD = 2.08), with 165 women (67%) having less than 11 g Hb/dl. Forty-one women (17%) had less than 9 g Hb/dl and 16 (6%) had less than 7 g Hb/dl. Severe maternal anemia and pallor of the conjunctiva were significantly associated with pre-term delivery and perinatal death, but not with low birth weight. The sensitivity of the pallor of the conjunctiva for detection of severe maternal anemia was 87%, and its specificity was 88%. We found no evidence that maternal Hb levels of 9 to 10.9 g/dl were associated with a high risk of poor pregnancy outcome for either the mother or the child, although women with such levels of Hb are classed as anemic by the World Health Organization criteria. These results show that poor pregnancy outcome is associated with severe maternal anemia. Examination of the coloration of the conjunctiva is a suitable and affordable screening method for the detection of severe anemia. Mothers with severe anemia present with signs and symptoms of anemia and could therefore be given iron treatment to improve their health. This demonstrates the importance of nutritional intervention during pregnancy.",1999,Sante
Prostate cancer detection from model-free T1-weighted time series and diffusion imaging,"The combination of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) images with diffusion MRI has shown great potential in prostate cancer detection. The parameterization of DCE images to generate cancer markers is traditionally performed based on pharmacokinetic modeling. However, pharmacokinetic models make simplistic assumptions about the tissue perfusion process, require the knowledge of contrast agent concentration in a major artery, and the modeling process is sensitive to noise and fitting instabilities. We address this issue by extracting features directly from the DCE T1-weighted time course without modeling. In this work, we employed a set of data-driven features generated by mapping the DCE T1 time course to its principal component space, along with diffusion MRI features to detect prostate cancer. The optimal set of DCE features is extracted with sparse regularized regression through a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) model. We show that when our proposed features are used within the multiparametric MRI protocol to replace the pharmacokinetic parameters, the area under ROC curve is 0.91 for peripheral zone classification and 0.87 for whole gland classification. We were able to correctly classify 32 out of 35 peripheral tumor areas identified in the data when the proposed features were used with support vector machine classification. The proposed feature set was used to generate cancer likelihood maps for the prostate gland.",2015,
"Environmental Correlates to Genetic Variation in the Coral Reef Fish, Thalassoma bifasciatum","Genetic variation was examined in bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, populations along the Florida Keys. Interpretion of mean heterozygosity (H), percent polymorphic loci per population (P), genetic similarity, and F and G statistics demonstrated a clear division of wrasse populations into ""northern"" and ""southern"" groups. Correlation and cluster analyses indicated the six reefs can be grouped in a similar fashion based on genetic and environmental data. The conclusion from this analysis of wrasse populations in the Florida Keys is that substantial population subdivision occurs in response to differing selective pressures created by heterogeneous environments.",1988,
A sequential solution for anisotropic total variation image denoising with interval constraints.,"We show that two problems involving the anisotropic total variation (TV) and interval constraints on the unknown variables admit, under some conditions, a simple sequential solution. Problem 1 is a constrained TV penalized image denoising problem; problem 2 is a constrained fused lasso signal approximator. The sequential solution entails finding first the solution to the unconstrained problem, and then applying a thresholding to satisfy the constraints. If the interval constraints are uniform, this sequential solution solves problem 1. If the interval constraints furthermore contain zero, the sequential solution solves problem 2. Here uniform interval constraints refer to all unknowns being constrained to the same interval. A typical example of application is image denoising in x-ray CT, where the image intensities are non-negative as they physically represent linear attenuation coefficient in the patient body. Our results are simple yet seem unknown; we establish them using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for constrained convex optimization.",2017,Physics in medicine and biology
Forecasting Simultaneously High-Dimensional Time Series: A Robust Model-Based Clustering Approach,"This paper considers the problem of forecasting high-dimensional time series. It employs a robust clustering approach to perform classification of the component series. Each series within a cluster is assumed to follow the same model and the data are then pooled for estimation. The classification is model-based and robust to outlier contamination. The robustness is achieved by using the intrinsic mode functions of the Hilbertâ€“Huang transform at lower frequencies. These functions are found to be robust to outlier contamination. The paper also compares out-of-sample forecast performance of the proposed method with several methods available in the literature. The other forecasting methods considered include vector autoregressive models with=without LASSO, group LASSO, principal component regression, and partial least squares. The proposed method is found to perform well in out-of-sample forecasting of the monthly unemployment rates of 50 US states. Copyright Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2013,Journal of Forecasting
Nonparametric regression with adaptive truncation via a convex hierarchical penalty,"&NA; We consider the problem of nonparametric regression with a potentially large number of covariates. We propose a convex, penalized estimation framework that is particularly well suited to highâ€dimensional sparse additive models and combines the appealing features of finite basis representation and smoothing penalties. In the case of additive models, a finite basis representation provides a parsimonious representation for fitted functions but is not adaptive when component functions possess different levels of complexity. In contrast, a smoothing splineâ€type penalty on the component functions is adaptive but does not provide a parsimonious representation. Our proposal simultaneously achieves parsimony and adaptivity in a computationally efficient way. We demonstrate these properties through empirical studies and show that our estimator converges at the minimax rate for functions within a hierarchical class. We further establish minimax rates for a large class of sparse additive models. We also develop an efficient algorithm that scales similarly to the lasso with the number of covariates and sample size.",2019,Biometrika
"Wine and olive oil permeation in pitched and non-pitched ceramics: relation with results from archaeological amphorae from Sagalassos, Turkey","Pitch compounds are frequently identified inside archaeological ceramic vessels. As their presence might affect the permeation of oil or wine into the ceramic fabric, experiments were conducted in which the diffusion of lipids or polyphenols into pitched and non-pitched modern vessels was followed by chemical analysis. Results show that the polyphenols of wine can intrude into the ceramics even through a pitch layer. Consequently, the absence of polyphenols in archaeological sherds is not due to their inability to reach the ceramic matrix under the pitch layer. By contrast, a pitch layer is quite effective to avoid oil intrusion into the ceramic matrix. Thus, it seems logical that oil amphorae would have been coated with pitch at the inside prior to use. Experiments in which the pitched ceramic was simultaneously exposed to oil and wine, show that the wine makes the pitch more permeable for the lipid compounds. These experimental data are confronted with residue analysis results obtained on amphorae fragments excavated in Sagalassos, Turkey. Pitch and oil were frequently found together. Based on a polyphenol test, indications for wine storage could only be obtained for two vessels. Against this background, the possible uses of the Sagalassos amphorae are discussed, and the traditional association of pine pitch with wine storage in archaeological amphorae is critically assessed.",2009,Journal of Archaeological Science
A Study of Transportation of Timber by Long Distance Conveyor Lasso-3S in West Bengal,The valuable inaccessible forests of North Bengal which virtually remained unex ploited over centuries are opened up now due to the introductiou of elaborate and efficient complex of aerial transportation units like the Lasso-3S.

The Lasso-3S ropeway is permanently installed over a span of 4.02 km and are feeded by two Hinteregger all terrain skyline cranes. The coat of aerial transportation of timber over the distance in calculated and found to be Rs. 93.34 per m 3 . It is observed that there is still a scope of increasing the efficiency of the machine by 23.43% which will ultimately reduce the coat of transportation to Rs. 46.67 per m 3 .,1978,The Indian Forester
The P-LOOP Estimator: Covariate Adjustment for Paired Experiments.,"In paired experiments, participants are grouped into pairs with similar characteristics, and one observation from each pair is randomly assigned to treatment. Because of both the pairing and the randomization, the treatment and control groups should be well balanced; however, there may still be small chance imbalances. It may be possible to improve the precision of the treatment effect estimate by adjusting for these imbalances. Building on related work for completely randomized experiments, we propose the P-LOOP (paired leave-one-out potential outcomes) estimator for paired experiments. We leave out each pair and then impute its potential outcomes using any prediction algorithm. The imputation method is flexible; for example, we could use lasso or random forests. While similar methods exist for completely randomized experiments, covariate adjustment methods in paired experiments are relatively understudied. A unique trade-off exists for paired experiments, where it can be unclear whether to factor in pair assignments when making adjustments. We address this issue in the P-LOOP estimator by automatically deciding whether to account for the pairing when imputing the potential outcomes. By addressing this trade-off, the method has the potential to improve precision over existing methods.",2019,arXiv: Applications
Algorithms for Fitting the Constrained Lasso.,"We compare alternative computing strategies for solving the constrained lasso problem. As its name suggests, the constrained lasso extends the widely-used lasso to handle linear constraints, which allow the user to incorporate prior information into the model. In addition to quadratic programming, we employ the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and also derive an efficient solution path algorithm. Through both simulations and benchmark data examples, we compare the different algorithms and provide practical recommendations in terms of efficiency and accuracy for various sizes of data. We also show that, for an arbitrary penalty matrix, the generalized lasso can be transformed to a constrained lasso, while the converse is not true. Thus, our methods can also be used for estimating a generalized lasso, which has wide-ranging applications. Code for implementing the algorithms is freely available in both the Matlab toolbox SparseReg and the Julia package ConstrainedLasso.

[Risk assessment in young people living in Bobo Dioulasso: analysis of factors associated with sexual precocity and multiple partners].,"INTRODUCTION
Despite health education efforts, young people continue to adopt risky sexual behaviors which may have a significant impact on their health. This study aims to analyze the factors associated with sexual precocity and multiple partners among young people aged 19-24 years living in Bobo-Dioulasso.


METHODS
We conducted a quantitative, cross-sectional study. Survey data were collected from 573 young people aged 15-24 years in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) in December 2014. The respondents were selected using two stages cluster sampling. Risk factors for sexual precocity and multiple partners were analyzed using Stata 13 IC software. We used P<0.05 as the significance level.


RESULTS
More than half of respondents (54%) were sexually active, of whom 14% before the age of 16. Having multiple sex partners was reported by 24% of sexually active youth. Determinants of sexual precocity and multiple partners were age, sex, level of education and economic status of parents. Our data have also shown that early sexual debut was associated with multiple sexual partners (p<0.005).


CONCLUSION
Actions aimed to convince young people to delay sexual debut and to better assess risks are of utmost importance. Enhancing parents, teachers and carers capabilities is essential to improve the quality of their relationships with young people.",2016,The Pan African medical journal
Prognostic Gene Discovery in Glioblastoma Patients using Deep Learning,"This study aims to discover genes with prognostic potential for glioblastoma (GBM) patients' survival in a patient group that has gone through standard of care treatments including surgeries and chemotherapies, using tumor gene expression at initial diagnosis before treatment. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM gene expression data are used as inputs to build a deep multilayer perceptron network to predict patient survival risk using partial likelihood as loss function. Genes that are important to the model are identified by the input permutation method. Univariate and multivariate Cox survival models are used to assess the predictive value of deep learned features in addition to clinical, mutation, and methylation factors. The prediction performance of the deep learning method was compared to other machine learning methods including the ridge, adaptive Lasso, and elastic net Cox regression models. Twenty-seven deep-learned features are extracted through deep learning to predict overall survival. The top 10 ranked genes with the highest impact on these features are related to glioblastoma stem cells, stem cell niche environment, and treatment resistance mechanisms, including POSTN, TNR, BCAN, GAD1, TMSB15B, SCG3, PLA2G2A, NNMT, CHI3L1 and ELAVL4.",2019,Cancers
Characterisation of tissue remodelling and inflammation in models of osteoarthritis,"Objectives. The role of proteinase activated receptor2 (PAR2) in regulating inflammation and tissue remodelling was evaluated in two experimental models of osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. OA was induced by either destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM) or disruption of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in PAR2 wild-type (WT) and PAR2 knock-out (KO) mice (1). Using histological scoring and computerized planimetry, the effect of PAR2 deficiency on cartilage damage, bone sclerosis, and ligament remodelling was assessed at 1 year post-DMM induction. Synovitis and immune cell characterization were evaluated at 4 weeks post-surgery. Flow cytometry was used to assess immune cell populations in spleens from both models. Results. PAR2 KO mice showed a significant decrease in cartilage damage, bone sclerosis and ligament remodelling in one year DMM compared to WT (n=5 per group, p<0.05). Further characterization of the meniscotibial and anterior cruciate ligament in controls demonstrated the presence of PAR2, bone remodelling markers, hypertrophic-like chondrocyte cells and chondrocytelike cells, with an absence of macrophages. At 4 week in both WT DMM and ACL, macrophages (F4/80) were observed in the ligaments. Immune cell populations remained unchanged between groups with no significant synovitis observed. Conclusion. Disruption of PAR2 offers protection against cartilage degradation, bone sclerosis and ligament remodelling. There was no detectable inflammation in the OA models studied. 1. Glasson, SS et al.

Titanium alloy with nanotubular surface modification for orthopaedic applications Eva JablonskÃ¡, Penelope M. Tsimbouri, Matthew J. Dalby Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague, Czech Republic Centre for Cell Engineering, Institute of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of Glasgow, Scotland eva.jablonska@vscht.cz Introduction Titanium and its alloys have been widely used in orthopaedics due to their good mechanical properties and biocompatibility. In order to accelerate healing and to improve the integration of the implant, various surface treatments can be performed. One of the possibilities is in situ preparation of nanotubes via anodic oxidation in the presence of fluoride ions. Nanostructured surfaces can mimic the extracellular matrix ability to trigger specific cell responses. Our aim is to prepare and test nanoscale surface modification that can support osteodifferentiation of the bone mesenchymal stem cells migrating to the site of the damage when implanted to the body. This would then prevent undesirable fibrous layer formation on the interphase leading to better fixation of the implant. Experimental Method The Ti-6Al-4V alloy with nanotubular surface modification (nanotubes of 50 nm and 100 nm in diameter) was tested using human mesenchymal stromal stem cells, human osteoprogenitors and human osteoblasts. Adhesion of MSCs and osteoprogenitors after three days was studied using fluorescent microscopy after immunostaining for vinculin and tubulin. Morphology of the cells and interaction with the nanotopography after three days was observed under scanning electron microscope. Metabolic activity of primary osteoblasts after one week was evaluated using MTT assay. After four weeks, markers of differentiation were determined using qPCR and morphology and cell numbers of MSCs were evaluated using immunofluorescent microscopy. Results We observed that adhesion and morphology on the surfaces was dependent on the cell type (MSCs being more sensitive than osteoprogenitors). Vinculin and tubulin intensity was significantly lower on nanostructured surfaces compared to polished control in case of the first donor; however, in the second case with different donor, there was no significant difference. Although there was neither significant difference in cell numbers nor in metabolic activity on the tested materials compared to polished control, we could observe a trend that nanotubes of smaller diameter (50 nm) seemed to be more suitable than 100nm nanotubes. Using qRT-PCR, we were not able to detect any conclusive changes in expression of osteogenic markers. ALP expression was downregulated on both nanosurfaces, whereas OCN expression was upregulated on 100nm nanotubes. Other osteogenic markers (OPN, OSX, osteonectin) as well as other markers of adipoand chondrodifferentiation (PPAR-gama and SOX9, respectively) remained unchanged. After four weeks of growth on the surfaces, MSCs on nanostructure had similar morphology to the polished control and there was no difference in cell numbers within the samples. Conclusions Nanotubular morphology on titanium alloy did not impair growth of primary human osteoblasts, osteoprogenitors and hMSCs. However we didnâ€™t observe any strong effect of nanotubes on stem cell fate, which could be caused by interference of the fibrogenic character of the titanium material. Nanotubes of smaller diameter might have more pronounced effect. References 1. Dalby M. J., Gadegaard N., Oreffo R. O. C.: Nat. mater., 13, 558-569 (2014).

However, Ti is bioinert and this can affect osseointegration and outcomes of implants. Nanopatterning of implant surfaces could be the solution to this hurdle. We have shown that 15nm high nanopillars are bioactive using human MSCs and could improve osseointegration. We have also developed an osteoblast/osteoclast co-culture system using nanopits on polycarbonate. Here, we have used these co-cultures as they give an accurate representation of the in vivo environment, allowing assessment of bone remodelling related to biomaterials. AIM: Under co-culture conditions 15nm high Ti nanopillars, will induce osteoblastogenesis and reduce osteoclast activity, producing a method of enhancing secondary implant fixation. METHODS: Osteoblast/osteoclast progenitors co-cultured on polished Ti (control) and 15nm Ti nanopillars fabricated by the block copolymer technique. 14d and 28d time points were selected for analysis of osseointegration in vivo. Quantification of osteoclasts and bone nodule formation performed using histochemical staining. Morphological changes were examined by SEM. qRT-PCR was used to quantify expression of osteoblast, osteoclast and inflammatory response related genes. RESULTS: Using SEM, nanopillar Ti substrates were less inductive of osteoclastogenesis, with decreased maturity and activity with time, when compared to control (Fig.1a). Supportive TRAP staining showed macrophages/osteoclast projenitors present on control only (Fig.1b). Alizarin red staining indicated increased osteogenesis on the nanopillars (Fig.1c). qRT-PCR revealed a timerelated decrease in osteoclastogenesis-related genes on the nanopillars with an associated increase in osteoclast inhibitors. Fig.1 Showing a) SEM, b) TRAP and c) Alizarin staining results (n=3, T-test, *p<0.05, ***p<0.001). DISCUSSION: Dramatic reduction in number of osteoclast progenitor cells and increased osteoblastogenesis on the nanopillar substrates versus control. Genomic data on osteoclast and osteoblast-related genes will be presented. REFERENCES: L.E. McNamara,et al (2012) J. R. Soc. Interface. T. SjÃ¶strÃ¶m et al (2013) Adv. Healthcare Mater. P.

Goodyear Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK Background and objectives: HLA-B27 expression is associated with spondyloarthropathy (SpA) and transgenic rats expressing human HLA-B27 and b2-microglobulin (B27 rats) display systemic inflammation and bone loss, which resembles human SpA. We have previously demonstrated that these rats lack a dendritic cell population. However, the myeloid compartment has not been completely characterized. Here, we aimed to characterize monocyte and pre-osteoclast populations in the bone marrow and blood of B27 rats, and examined the potential of different monocyte/preosteoclast subsets to generate mature osteoclasts in vitro. Materials and methods: 14-16 week old control (B7) and B27 rats were bled and plasma CCL2 levels were measured by ELISA. Monocytes subsets were analysed and quantified in both the bone marrow and blood of B27, B7 and non-transgenic animals, by evaluation of surface markers (CD172a, CD43, and CD11b) and intracellular uptake of fluorescent M-CSF and CCL2 by flow cytometry. Monocyte populations were FACS sorted and cultured in pro-osteoclastogenic medium for 7 days to evaluate osteoclastogenic potential. Cultures were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and mature osteoclasts (TRAP and â‰¥3 nuclei) were quantified by light microscopy. Results: A previously unidentified CD172a CD43 CD11b population of monocytes was observed in the bone marrow. These are bona fide monocytes, expressing CD115 and CCR2, as determined by uptake of fluorescent M-CSF and CCL2 respectively. Interestingly, this new monocyte population was significantly increased in B27 rats. Assessment of the osteoclastogenic potential of bone marrow monocyte subsets revealed that CD172a CD43 CD11b, but not CD172a CD43 CD",2015,
Use of multivariate statistical methods for the analysis of metabolomic data,"In the last decades, advances in technology have enabled the gathering of an increasingly amount of data in the field of biology and biomedicine. The so called ""-omics"" technologies such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics or metabolomics, among others, produce hundreds, thousands or even millions of variables per data set. The analysis of â€™omicâ€™ data presents different complexities that can be methodological and computational. This has driven a revolution in the development of new statistical methods specifically designed for dealing with these type of data. To this methodological complexities one must add the logistic and economic restrictions usually present in scientific research projects that lead to small sample sizes paired to these wide data sets. This makes the analyses even harder, since there is a problem in having many more variables than observations. Among the methods developed to deal with these type of data there are some based on the penalization of the coefficients, such as lasso or elastic net, others based on projection techniques, such as PCA or PLS, and others based in regression or classification trees and ensemble methods such as random forest. All these techniques work fine when dealing with different â€™omicâ€™ data in matrix format (I xJ ), but sometimes, these I xJ data sets can be expanded by taking, for example, repeated measurements at different time points for each individual, thus having I xJxK data sets that raise more methodological com-",2019,
Improving the Practicality of Model-Based Reinforcement Learning: An Investigation into Scaling up Model-Based Methods in Online Settings,"This thesis is a response to the current scarcity of practical model-based control algorithms in the reinforcement learning (RL) framework. As of yet there is no consensus on how best to integrate imperfect transition models into RL whilst mitigating policy improvement instabilities in online settings. Current state-of-the-art policy learning algorithms that surpass human performance often rely on model-free approaches that enjoy unmitigated sampling of transition data. Model-based RL (MBRL) instead attempts to distil experience into transition models that allow agents to plan new policies without needing to return to the environment and sample more data. The initial focus of this investigation is on kernel conditional mean embeddings (CMEs) (Song et al., 2009) deployed in an approximate policy iteration (API) algorithm (Grunewalder et al., 2012a). This existing MBRL algorithm boasts theoretically stable policy updates in continuous state and discrete action spaces. The Bellman operatorâ€™s value function and (transition) conditional expectation are modelled and embedded respectively as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The resulting finite-induced approximate pseudo-MDP (Yao et al., 2014a) can be solved exactly in a dynamic programming algorithm with policy improvement suboptimality guarantees. However model construction and policy planning scale cubically and quadratically respectively with the training set size, rendering the CME impractical for sampleabundant tasks in online settings. Three variants of CME API are investigated to strike a balance between stable policy updates and reduced computational complexity. The first variant models the value function and state-action representation explicitly in a parametric CME (PCME) algorithm with favourable computational complexity. However a soft conservative policy update technique is developed to mitigate policy learning oscillations in the planning process. The second variant returns to the non-parametric embedding and contributes (along with external work) to the compressed CME (CCME); a sparse and computationally more favourable CME. The final variant is a fully end-to-end differentiable embedding trained with stochastic gradient updates. The value function remains modelled in an RKHS such that backprop is driven by a non-parametric RKHS loss function. Actively compressed CME (ACCME) satisfies the pseudo-MDP contraction constraint using a sparse softmax activation function. The size of the pseudo-MDP (i.e. the size of the embeddingâ€™s last layer) is controlled by sparsifying the last layer weight matrix by extending the truncated gradient method (Langford et al., 2009) with group lasso updates in a novel â€˜use it or lose itâ€™ neuron pruning mechanism. Surprisingly this technique does not require extensive fine-tuning between control tasks.",2020,
Geologic Structural Synthesis of Pacific Area As Basis for Establishing Regularities of Distribution of Mineral Resources: ABSTRACT,"Geologic studies of the Pacific Ocean and its margins have advanced in the Soviet Union. Some of the results are presented on the unique published maps. (a) Tectonic Map of Eurasia, scale 1:5,000,000 (1966); (b) Geological Map of the Pacific Mobile Belt and the Pacific, scale 1:10,000,000 (1973); and (c) Tectonic Map of the Pacific Segment of the Earth, scale 1:10,000,000 (1970). Moreover, many maps and books have been published which deal with the geology and mineral resources of the northwestern segment of the Pacific including the eastern USSR. A geologic map synthesizes the data on stratigraphy, age, and composition of sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks on the Pacific continental margins, in the island arcs, and on the Pacific Ocean floor. The arrangement of geologic complexes of different age and character reflects various styles of tectonic systems on the inner structure: ancient platform--perioceanic belt--ocean. A regular rejuvenation of geologic complexes from continental nuclei toward the ocean is indicated. The map also shows that the distribution of sediment types on the Pacific floor is determined by such factors as climatic zonation, position of zones of upwelling and subsidence of waters, and depth of the ocean; whereas, in the perioceanic zones, a tectonic factor influencing intensity of supply of terrig nous and volcanic material is especially important. The tectonic map presents the structural formation of the Pacific area which is divided into four principal categories: folding zones of the ocean margins, recent geosynclinal zones, thalassogenes (large parts of the oceanic floor), and the East Pacific mobile belt. The structural analysis, on the whole, shows that plate tectonics fails to explain the constitution of the Pacific area. This hypothesis does not conform to the concept of the Circum-Pacific belt as the earth's structural zone of planetary importance. However, horizontal movements of rather large blocks and sheets of the Earth's crust are real. The geologic-structural synthesis creates the basis for general metallogenic constructions. Further studies on concentric zonation in the arrangement of ore deposits around the Pacific Ocean appear promising. The zone adjacent to the ocean is rich in gold and copper; the next continentward zone is characterized by rich deposits of tin and tungsten (in addition to gold) in Asia, and lead and zinc in North America. The ophiolitic belts are characterized by peculiar complexes of metals. Study of morphologic and geodynamic properties of ore-controlling faults poses a special problem. The ocean floor is characterized by extensive accumulations of manganese-polymetallic ores and locally by metasomatic phosphorites. The geologic-structural synthesis is important for prediction of oil and gas prospects. About 140 actual and possible gas and oil basins have been recorded in the Pacific margins. Most of them are associated with depressions and basins within folded zones and oceanic depressions. The basins in the perioceanic sector are composed mostly of Cenozoic deposits; the main productive strata are Miocene to Pliocene in age. Oil and gas already have been detected in about half of the basins. End_of_Article - Last_Page 1455------------",1974,AAPG Bulletin

High Temperature Resistant Structures,"OF THE DISCLOSUIRE Ablative and high temperature resistant articles formed by Shaping into a desired structure a cellulosic solution containing a metal compound which is converted into a hydrate of a glassor lattice-forming metal or inorganic oxide and processing the shaped structure to remove the Solvent, Solidify the cellulosic material and polymerize the inorganic oxide hydrate. Application of heat to the structure in the absence of oxygen converts the struc ture to an inorganic oxide-carbon product and subse quently to an inorganic or metal carbide. Heat applied to the structure in the presence of oxygen converts the Structure to an organic oxide product. This application is a continuation-in-part of my ap plication Ser.

This invention relates to high temperature resistant sinterable and/or sintered shaped bodies such as, for example, films, fibers, plates and the like and to a method of forming such bodies. In the past, high temperature resistant shaped bodies have been formed or substances which themselves re main substantially unaltered under the conditions exist ing at the certain high temperatures. Presently, bodies are formed of mixtures of Substances so that the shaped body may be considered as an ablative article. In this type article or body, certain of the constituents are not in themselves resistant to the high temperature conditions but dissipate energy by becoming transformed from one form or state to another and may then become ablated. However, other constituents are resistant to the higher temperatures and retain the physical form or structure of the original body. The present invention relates to shaped bodies which may be classed as ablative structure which, during use, are transformed or converted into sintered ceramic structures and to sintered ceramic structures. The termed 'ceramic' is used herein to designate metal or inorganic oxides which are classed as glass-forming Oxides and perhaps more accurately termed ""lattice-form ing oxides.' Hydrates of these inorganic oxides form a lattice or network structure which is in many respects comparable to the more widely known organic polym erizations. In accordance with this invention, the struc ture may comprise a single metal or inorganic oxide Such as boron oxide, silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, Zirconium oxide, tungsten oxide, molyb denum oxide, niobium oxide, tantalum oxide, chromium oxide or mixtures of the oxides or the composition may include various materials termed â€œintermediates' and ""modifiers' in the ceramic art. The actual final melting or softening point of the ceramic structure will be de pendent upon the specific composition and may be varied by incorporating the various modifiers or intermediates in the structure during the process of manufacture.

En lo referente al estudio de Â«lo cotidianoÂ» en el ambito artistico, hemos asistido a la promocion de un arte centrado en los elementos inmateriales de la relacion sujeto-realidad proxima. Sin embargo, recientemente presenciamos un giro en la produccion artistica y teorica determinado por el encuentro entre el arte y las teorias adscritas al materialismo o realismo especulativo, que condiciona la interpretacion de las Â«cosasÂ» cotidianas y favorece una redefinicion en sentido experimental de tales practicas artisticas objetuales. Estamos asistiendo a un cambio de paradigma referente a la presencia de elementos de Â«lo cotidianoÂ» en el arte contemporaneo: desde el marco linguistico y textual, que interpreta las practicas con objetos cotidianos recurriendo a la semiologia y la semiotica, hasta el marco poetico especulativo, que contempla lo cotidiano en la obra de arte a partir del nuevo concepto de materialidad establecido por las teorias del materialismo/realismo especulativo y en general del nuevo materialismo. Los elementos materiales cotidianos en las obras que se inscriben en el segundo paradigma no son usados como signos funcionales con un referente trascendente, es decir, como metaforas, sino que son objeto de una especulacion y experimentacion que trata de profundizar en su identidad fisica.

EnglishThe aim of this article is to demonstrate â€”in regard to works made from everyday objectsâ€” the incipient materialist shift in contemporary art compared to the previous textual shift, and to put forward some recent conclusions about the encounter between â€œthe everydayâ€, materialism/speculative realism (Quentin Meillassoux; Levi Bryant; Graham Harman) and art practice, which will be approached specifically through the works of Nicolas Lamas: Boundary (2013), Ball (2013), Line (2013), What does a fish know about the water in which he swims all his life? (2014) and Geometritation of the world (2013). Regarding the study of â€œthe everydayâ€ in the world of art, we have witnessed the promotion of art centred on the immaterial elements of the relationship between the subject and immediate reality. However, we have recently seen a shift in theoretical and artistic output determined by the encounter between art and theories linked to materialism or speculative realism, which conditions the interpretation of everyday â€œthingsâ€ and fosters a redefinition, in an experimental sense, of such object art practices. We are witnessing a paradigm shift regarding the presence of elements of â€œthe everydayâ€ in contemporary art: from the textual and linguistic framework that interprets practices with everyday objects by resorting to semiology and semiotics, to the speculative poetic framework that contemplates the everyday in works of art based on new concepts of materiality established by the theories of materialism/speculative realism and, in general, of new materialism. Everyday material elements in works that fall within the second paradigm are not used as functional signs with a transcendent referent, that is, as metaphors, but are instead the object of speculation and experimentation that endeavours to delve into their physical identity. The works composed of everyday objects by the Peruvian artist Nicolas Lamas could be considered material speculations of reality based on artistic manipulation and the installation of everyday elements in a continuous dialogue with space and other objects immersed in it. catalaL'objectiu d'aquest article es demostrar â€”amb referencia a obres realitzades amb objectes quotidiansâ€” l'incipient caire materialista a l'art contemporani respecte al precedent caire textual i avancar algunes conclusions recents quant al trobament entre la Â«quotidianitatÂ», materialisme/realisme especulatiu (Quentin Meillassoux; Levi Bryant; Graham Harman) i la practica artistica, que s'aproximaran concretament mitjancant les obres de Nicolas Lamas: Boundary (2013), Ball (2013), Line (2013), What does a fish know about the water in which he swims all his life?

Discrete and Continuous Sparse Recovery Methods and Their Applications,"OF THE DISSERTATION Discrete and Continuous Sparse Recovery Methods and Their Applications by Zhao Tan Doctor of Philosophy in Electrical Engineering Washington University in St. Louis, 2015 Professor Arye Nehorai, Chair Low dimensional signal processing has drawn an increasingly broad amount of attention in the past decade, because prior information about a low-dimensional space can be exploited to aid in the recovery of the signal of interest. Among all the different forms of low dimensionality, in this dissertation we focus on the synthesis and analysis models of sparse recovery. This dissertation comprises two major topics. For the first topic, we discuss the synthesis model of sparse recovery and consider the dictionary mismatches in the model. We further introduce a continuous sparse recovery to eliminate the existing off-grid mismatches for DOA estimation. In the second topic, we focus on the analysis model, with an emphasis on efficient algorithms and performance analysis. In considering the sparse recovery method with structured dictionary mismatches for the synthesis model, we exploit the joint sparsity between the mismatch parameters and original sparse signal. We demonstrate that by exploiting this information, we can obtain a robust reconstruction under mild conditions on the sensing matrix. This model is very useful for radar and passive array applications. We propose several efficient algorithms to solve the ix joint sparse recovery problem. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform several methods in the literature. We further extend the mismatch model to a continuous sparse model, using the mathematical theory of super resolution. Statistical analysis shows the robustness of the proposed algorithm. A number-detection algorithm is also proposed for the co-prime arrays. By using numerical examples, we show that continuous sparse recovery further improves the DOA estimation accuracy, over both the joint sparse method and also MUSIC with spatial smoothing. In the second topic, we visit the corresponding analysis model of sparse recovery. Instead of assuming a sparse decomposition of the original signal, the analysis model focuses on the existence of a linear transformation which can make the original signal sparse. In this work we use a monotone version of the fast iterative shrinkagethresholding algorithm (MFISTA) to yield efficient algorithms to solve the sparse recovery. We examine two widely used relaxation techniques, namely smoothing and decomposition, to relax the optimization. We show that although these two techniques are equivalent in their objective functions, the smoothing technique converges faster than the decomposition technique. We also compute the performance guarantee for the analysis model when a LASSO type of reconstruction is performed. By using numerical examples, we are able to show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than other state of the art algorithms.",2015,
T-ReCS: Stable Selection of Dynamically Formed Groups of Features with Application to Prediction of Clinical Outcomes,"Feature selection is used extensively in biomedical research for biomarker identification and patient classification, both of which are essential steps in developing personalized medicine strategies. However, the structured nature of the biological datasets and high correlation of variables frequently yield multiple equally optimal signatures, thus making traditional feature selection methods unstable. Features selected based on one cohort of patients, may not work as well in another cohort. In addition, biologically important features may be missed due to selection of other co-clustered features We propose a new method, Tree-guided Recursive Cluster Selection (T-ReCS), for efficient selection of grouped features. T-ReCS significantly improves predictive stability while maintains the same level of accuracy. T-ReCS does not require an a priori knowledge of the clusters like group-lasso and also can handle ""orphan"" features (not belonging to a cluster). T-ReCS can be used with categorical or survival target variables. Tested on simulated and real expression data from breast cancer and lung diseases and survival data, T-ReCS selected stable cluster features without significant loss in classification accuracy.",2015,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

Evaluation of Head and Spinal Cord Injury Care in Ecuador using the IATSIC/WHOEssential Guidelines for Trauma Care,"Background: Neurological trauma represents a major cause ofglobal death and disability, with low and middle income countriesrepresenting the greatest burden of disease. The goal of thisstudy was to assess the capability of Ecuadorian hospitals tomanage head and spinal cord injury utilizing the InternationalAssociation for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care (IATSIC)/ World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for EssentialTrauma Care (EsTC).Materials and methods: Site visits were performed at 24hospitals in 7 provinces of southeastern Ecuador. The 23 humanand physical resources required for management of head injury(HI) and spinal injury (SI) were evaluated using EsTC criteria.Resource capabilities were graded as 3 (adequate, >90%), 2(partially adequate, >50%), 1 (inadequate, <50%), or 0 (absent).Results: Five tertiary (TH) and 12 general (GH) public hospitalswere included in the fi nal assessment. Initial assessment ofneurological injuries was at least partially adequate for HI(100% TH/GH) and partially adequate for SI (100%TH, 83.3%GH). Maintenance of normotension and oxygenation to preventsecondary neurological injury was partially adequate in TH(100% HI/SI) and inadequate in GH (only 58.3% were partiallyadequate for HI and 67.7% for SI). Surgical capabilities fortreatment of neurological injuries were partially adequate withwide variability in TH. Familiarity or compliance with AANSguidelines and international classifi cation systems for HI andSI were absent at all facilities.

Comparison of the modified unbounded penalty and the LASSO to select predictive genes of response to chemotherapy in breast cancer,"Covariate selection is a fundamental step when building sparse prediction models in order to avoid overfitting and to gain a better interpretation of the classifier without losing its predictive accuracy. In practice the LASSO regression of Tibshirani, which penalizes the likelihood of the model by the L1 norm of the regression coefficients, has become the gold-standard to reach these objectives. Recently Lee and Oh developed a novel random-effect covariate selection method called the modified unbounded penalty (MUB) regression, whose penalization function can equal minus infinity at 0 in order to produce very sparse models. We sought to compare the predictive accuracy and the number of covariates selected by these two methods in several high-dimensional datasets, consisting in genes expressions measured to predict response to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. These comparisons were performed by building the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves of the classifiers obtained with the selected genes and by comparing their area under the ROC curve (AUC) corrected for optimism using several variants of bootstrap internal validation and cross-validation. We found consistently in all datasets that the MUB penalization selected a remarkably smaller number of covariates than the LASSO while offering a similar-and encouraging-predictive accuracy. The models selected by the MUB were actually nested in the ones obtained with the LASSO. Similar findings were observed when comparing these results to those obtained in their first publication by other authors or when using the area under the Precision-Recall curve (AUCPR) as another measure of predictive performance. In conclusion, the MUB penalization seems therefore to be one of the best options when sparsity is required in high-dimension. Further investigation in other datasets is however required to validate these findings.",2018,PLoS ONE
Calibrationless Oscar-Based Image Reconstruction in Compressed Sensing Parallel MRI,"Reducing acquisition time is a crucial issue in MRI especially in the high resolution context. Compressed sensing has faced this problem for a decade. However, to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), CS must be combined with parallel imaging. This leads to harder reconstruction problems that usually require the knowledge of coil sensitivity profiles. In this work, we introduce a calibrationless image reconstruction approach that no longer requires this knowledge. The originality of this work lies in using for reconstruction a group sparsity structure (called OSCAR) across channels that handles SNR inhomogeneities across receivers. We compare this re-construction with other calibrationless approaches based on group-LASSO and its sparse variation as well as with the auto-calibrated method called $\ell_{1}$-ESPIRiT. We demonstrate that OSCAR outperforms its competitors and provides similar results to $\ell_{1}$-ESPIRiT. This suggests that the sensitivity maps are no longer required to per-form combined CS and parallel imaging reconstruction.",2019,2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019)
High Dimensional Estimation and Multi-Factor Models,"The purpose of this paper is to test a multi-factor model for realized returns implied by the generalized arbitrage pricing theory (APT) recently developed by Jarrow and Protter (2016) and Jarrow (2016). This model relaxes the convention that the number of risk-factors is small. We estimate this model using a new approach for identifying risk-factors. We first obtain the collection of all possible risk-factors and then provide a simultaneous test, security by security, of which risk-factors are significant for which securities. Since the collection of risk-factors is large and highly correlated, high-dimension methods (including the LASSO and prototype clustering) are used. The multi-factor model is shown to have a significantly better fit than the Fama-French 5-factor model. Robustness tests are also provided.",2018,arXiv: Statistical Finance
Symposium on the Control of HÃ¦mopoiesis,"Much is now known about the structure and genetic control of human heemoglobin. This gystem is controlled at both genic and cytoplasmic levels. As yet, there is no good evidence for genic control of human haemoglobin production although such mechanisms must exist. There is increasing evidence that cytoplasmic control mechanisms are involved in the assembly of the globin chains and their release from the ribosomes. There is no definite evidence yet for control at the level of the association of the various hCmoglobin subunits although again such a mechanism seems likely. The findings in certain disease states such as -thalasso mia can be explained in terms of abnormal cytoplasmic control mechanismt, many secondary events resulting from a primary defect in globin chain production.",1967,Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine
Exploring conceptual preprocessing for developing prognostic models: A case study in low back pain patients.,"OBJECTIVE
A conceptually oriented pre-processing of a large number of potential prognostic factors may improve the development of a prognostic model. This study investigated whether various forms of conceptually oriented pre-processing or the preselection of established factors was superior to using all factors as input.


STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING
We made use of an existing project which developed two conceptually oriented subgroupings of low back-pain patients. Based on the prediction of six outcome variables by seven statistical methods, this type of pre-processing was compared with medical experts' preselection of established factors, as well as with using all 112 available baseline factors.


RESULTS
Subgrouping of patients was associated with low prognostic capacity. Applying a Lasso-based variable selection to all factors or to domain-specific principal component scores performed best. The preselection of established factors showed a good compromise between model complexity and prognostic capacity.


CONCLUSION
The prognostic capacity is hard to improve by means of a conceptually oriented pre-processing when compared to purely statistical approaches. However, a careful selection of already established factors combined in a simple linear model should be considered as an option when constructing a new prognostic rule based on a large number of potential prognostic factors.",2020,Journal of clinical epidemiology

[Diarrheic diseases in children. Rationalization of fecal test].,"The level of diarrheic diseases among children in Burkina Faso is very high. The identification of aetiologic agents of diarrhoea in hospitalized children (0-36 months) is one of the objectives of the study. All children less than 37 months old admitted to the Pediatric Unit of the National Hospital Souro Sanou of Bobo-Dioulasso between January 1990 and March 1991, were investigated by a standardized clinical examination, and in addition, we do an analysis of a rectal swab at admission and a stool to identify aetiologic enteric agents. As a conclusion to the study: an agent was isolated in 56% of the children with diarrhoea, and in 40% of the children without diarrhoea; some germs (such Salmonella, Shigella, Entamoeba) are found in children both with and without diarrhoea; also, the total of these examinations comes to 20 US $ per episode, or 100 US $ per children/year in Burkina Faso where the number of bouts reaches 5 times per year per infant who is less than 5 years old.

Results These 50 male and 51 female patients ranged in age from 18 to 79Â years at diagnosis (median 36Â years) with follow-ups from 1 to 261Â months (median 47Â months). The overall survival for all patients at 5 and 10 years was 58% and 41%, respectively, with a median survival of 85Â months (range 1â€“228). Out of 24 candidate prognosis factors, we selected seven covariates for proportional hazards model by Lasso procedure: age of diagnosis, ethnicity, need for corticosteroids, tumor grade, dysphagia, tumor location, and karnofsky performance status (KPS). Univariate analysis showed that these seven factors are significantly associated with survival. Multivariate analysis showed that four covariates significantly increased hazard for survival: ethnicity, tumor location, age of diagnosis, and tumor grade. Conclusions In this study, we identified four prognostic factors that were significantly associated with survival in adults with BSGs. Overall, these patients have a better prognosis than children with BSGs reported in the literature. These results call for larger prospective studies to fully assess the importance of these factors in the clinical setting and to help stratify patients in future clinical studies.",2008,Journal of Neuro-Oncology

"From the Cape to Canton: The Dutch Indian Ocean World, 1600-1800 â€” A Littoral Census","As an exercise in trans-oceanic history, this article focuses on the Dutch Indian Ocean World in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries from the Dutch East India Company or VOCâ€™s permanent colony at Cape Town, South Africa, in the Far West to its seasonal trading factory at Canton (Guangzhou), in the Far East. It argues that the â€˜seismic changeâ€™ after 1760 noted by Michael Pearson and associated with the British move inland from their Bengal â€˜bridgeheadâ€™ should be extended to the contemporary polycentric Dutch expansion into the interior of, most notably, South Africa, Ceylon, Java, and Eastern Indonesia. Demographic measuring points include the number of Dutch citizens and subjects, comprising European settlers, mixed peoples, and indigenous populations; and: the size and composition of the population of central nodal places in the Dutch Indian Ocean thalassocratic network in the late seventeenth and late eighteenth centuries. By the end of the period, both â€˜John Companyâ€™ (EIC) and â€˜Jan Kompenieâ€™ (VOC) effectively were, to some extent, reversing the colonial gaze inland turning from maritime merchants into landlords and tax collectors. These seismic changes with multiple epicenters were the harbinger of tidal waves about to sweep both the littoral and interior of the modern Indian Ocean World.",2019,
Analyzing Domestic Contexts at Sagalassos: Developing a Methodology Using Ceramics and Macro-Botanical Remains,"There has been a renewed interest in the study of domestic space in antiquity, focusing upon the importance of small, (semi-)portable objects and their contexts in order to investigate human behavior. In these studies, the use of domestic space is examined by describing the contents of rooms and by linking these contents to specific activities. This article adds to the discussion by proposing a methodology for interpreting artifact distribution patterns in three steps. First, the architectural subdivision of the space is determined. Second, we assess to what degree the assemblage as found is representative of the original content of a room, by examining the formation processes of the archaeological record. Third, the presence or absence of certain functional categories within the archaeological assemblage is investigated. The application of this methodology to the ceramic and palaeobotanic material recovered from a large urban villa at Sagalassos (southwest Turkey) makes it possible to identify the function of spaces, the social status of the inhabitants and the eventual abandonment patterns on the site.",2004,Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology

RESUMEN:
Esta tesis analiza las estrategias de reproduccion de las casas campesinas de la zona del Camp de Tarragona, en el contexto de un proceso de transicion social, siglos XVIII, XIX y XX caracterizado por la progresiva dependizacion de las economias agrarias respecto a la economia de mercado. Las practicas alrededor de la reproduccion se llevan a cabo gestionando los recursos propios de las casas campesinas, la herencia y el matrimonio son utilizados estrategicamente para regular la reproduccion del grupo y del patrimonio en cada generacion y tambien para garantizar su continuidad. En la medida que se mercantilizan los factores de produccion, los campesinos se ven empujados a implementar mas recursos reproductivos externos a la casa. La pluriactivitat economica creciente, presente en todo el periodo, y las asociaciones agrarias son factores de acomodacion de las casas campesinas a los cambios.
La metodologia de la tesis se ha disenado alrededor de dos unidades de observacion: la casa campesina y las asociaciones agrarias. Los datos con que se ha trabajado proceden del analisis del ciclo de desarrollo familiar y patrimonial de una casa campesina, cal Lluques y tambien del estudio del asociacionismo agrario en la misma localidad de donde procede la familia objeto de estudio, la Selva del Camp (Tarragona). La metodologia combina la consulta de fuentes documentales, de archivo, y la recogida de informacion oral, a traves de la realizacion de entrevistas de orientacion biografica.
El proceso de mercantilizacion de las economias campesinas que se analiza, ha sido estructurado en tres etapas. En la primera, desde el siglo XVIII hasta el ultimo cuarto del XIX, la casa es la unidad de produccion y de organizacion social basica, la comunidad local es su marco de integracion y la reproduccion economica esta completamente vinculada a la reproduccion familiar, de aqui la importancia de las estrategias de herencia y matrimonio. La inestabilidad de la explotacion como recurso productivo y reproductivo, depende del ciclo familiar mas que de las coyunturas economicas. El endeudamiento y la pluriactivitdad son, en este periodo, componentes estructurales de la reproduccion de las casas campesinas.
En la segunda etapa, desde finales del siglo XIX hasta los anos 30, empiezan a jugar un papel importante los recursos reproductivos externos a la casa. Las asociaciones agrarias entran en la escena local el ano 1900, cuando la crisis de finales de siglo provoca la expulsion de la poblacion jornalera, una emigracion que conlleva la dinamizacion del mercado de la tierra y el acceso de los pequenos campesinos a la propiedad de la tierra. Las asociaciones agrarias empiezan a estar presentes en las estrategias productivas y reproductivas de las casas, aunque hasta el momento del estallido de la guerra civil, su papel en la esfera productiva sera poco trascendente y tendera a reproducir las divisiones de la estructura social local.
Desde los anos 30 hasta hoy, se evidencia un aumento de los niveles de dependencia externa de las economias campesinas. Las estructuras cooperativas evolucionan de acuerdo con las exigencias del mercado pero su apoyo no resulta suficiente per garantizar la reproduccion de las familias. La actividad agraria llega a depender de la capacidad de acceso a nuevas formas de ingresos, a menudo procedentes de actividades salarizadas y se implanta la logica de la pluralidad de bases economicas com una forma de poder mantener las explotaciones. La dependencia permite mantener la casa com base de la produccion, pero no com base de la reproduccio ni de la organizacion social.

RESUM:
Aquesta tesi analitza les estrategies de reproduccio de les cases pageses de la zona del Camp de Tarragona, en el context dun proces de transicio social, segles XVIII, XIX i XX caracteritzat per la progressiva dependitzacio de les economies agraries respecte a leconomia de mercat. Les practiques al voltant de la reproduccio es duen a terme gestionant els recursos propis de les cases pageses, lherencia i el matrimoni son utilitzats estrategicament per regular la reproduccio del grup i del patrimoni a cada generacio i tambe, i molt important en la seva logica, per garantir-ne la continuitat. En la mesura que es mercantilitzen els factors de produccio, els pagesos es veuen empesos a implementar mes recursos reproductius externs a la casa. La pluriactivitat economica creixent, present en tot el periode, i les associacions agraries son factors dacomodacio de les cases pageses als canvis.
La metodologia de la tesi sha dissenyat al voltant de dues unitats dobservacio, per una banda, la casa pagesa, i per laltra les associacions agraries. Les dades amb que sha treballat procedeixen de lanalisi del cicle de desenvolupament familiar i patrimonial duna casa pagesa, cal Lluques i tambe de lestudi de lassociacionisme agrari a la mateixa localitat don procedeix la familia estudiada, la Selva del Camp (Tarragona). La metodologia combina la consulta de fonts documentals, darxiu, i la recollida dinformacio oral, a traves de la realitzacio dentrevistes dorientacio biografica.
El proces de mercantilitzacio de les economies pageses que sanalitza, ha estat estructurat en tres grans etapes. En la primera, des del segle XVIII fins al darrer quart del XIX, la casa es la unitat de produccio i dorganitzacio social basica, la comunitat local es el seu marc dintegracio i la reproduccio economica esta completament vinculada a la reproduccio familiar, daqui la importancia de les estrategies dherencia i matrimonials. La inestabilitat de lexplotacio com a recurs productiu i reproductiu, depen del cicle familiar, tant o mes que de les conjuntures economiques. Lendeutament i la pluriactivitat son, en aquest periode, components estructurals de la reproduccio de les cases pageses.
En la segona etapa, des de finals del segle XIX fins els anys 30, comencen a jugar un paper important els recursos reproductius externs a la casa. Les associacions agraries entren en lescena local lany 1900, quan la crisi de preus de finals de segle provoca lexpulsio de la poblacio jornalera, una emigracio que acaba comportant la dinamitzacio del mercat de la terra i lacces a la propietat per part dels petits pagesos. Les associacions pageses comencen a incorporar-se en les estrategies productives i reproductives de les cases, tot i que fins a la guerra, el seu paper en lesfera productiva sera poc transcendent i tendiran a reproduir les divisions de lestructura social local.
Des dels anys 30 fins avui, es fa evident la cada cop major dependencia externa de les economies pageses. Les estructures cooperatives evolucionen dacord amb les exigencies del mercat pero el seu recolzament no es suficient per garantir la reproduccio de les families pageses. Lagricultura es fa depenent de lacces a noves formes dingressos, molts cops provinents de relacions salarials, i simplanta la logica de la pluralitat de bases economiques com a forma de mantenir les explotacions. La reproduccio depenent permet mantenir la casa com a base de la produccio, pero no com a base de la reproduccio ni de lorganitzacio social.

The Sliding Frank-Wolfe Algorithm and its Application to Super-Resolution Microscopy,"This paper showcases the theoretical and numerical performance of the Sliding Frank-Wolfe, which is a novel optimization algorithm to solve the BLASSO sparse spikes super-resolution problem. The BLASSO is a continuous (i.e. off-the-grid or grid-less) counterpart to the well-known 1 sparse regularisation method (also known as LASSO or Basis Pursuit). Our algorithm is a variation on the classical Frank-Wolfe (also known as conditional gradient) which follows a recent trend of interleaving convex optimization updates (corresponding to adding new spikes) with non-convex optimization steps (corresponding to moving the spikes). Our main theoretical result is that this algorithm terminates in a finite number of steps under a mild non-degeneracy hypothesis. We then target applications of this method to several instances of single molecule fluorescence imaging modalities, among which certain approaches rely heavily on the inversion of a Laplace transform. Our second theoretical contribution is the proof of the exact support recovery property of the BLASSO to invert the 1-D Laplace transform in the case of positive spikes. On the numerical side, we conclude this paper with an extensive study of the practical performance of the Sliding Frank-Wolfe on different instantiations of single molecule fluorescence imaging, including convolutive and non-convolutive (Laplace-like) operators. This shows the versatility and superiority of this method with respect to alternative sparse recovery technics.",2018,arXiv: Numerical Analysis
Forward-Backward Selection with Early Dropping,"Forward-backward selection is one of the most basic and commonly-used feature selection algorithms available. It is also general and conceptually applicable to many different types of data. In this paper, we propose a heuristic that significantly improves its running time, while preserving predictive accuracy. The idea is to temporarily discard the variables that are conditionally independent with the outcome given the selected variable set. Depending on how those variables are reconsidered and reintroduced, this heuristic gives rise to a family of algorithms with increasingly stronger theoretical guarantees. In distributions that can be faithfully represented by Bayesian networks or maximal ancestral graphs, members of this algorithmic family are able to correctly identify the Markov blanket in the sample limit. In experiments we show that the proposed heuristic increases computational efficiency by about two orders of magnitude in high-dimensional problems, while selecting fewer variables and retaining predictive performance. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm and feature selection with LASSO perform similarly when restricted to select the same number of variables, making the proposed algorithm an attractive alternative for problems where no (efficient) algorithm for LASSO exists.",2019,J.

Preliminary observation on the isopod crustacean fauna of Aldabra Atoll,"A brief review of crustacean research on Aldabra is presented, with the few isopod studies being listed. Two major divisions are emphasized when dealing with crustacean biogeography-those groups having a planktonic stage allowing for dispersal (e.g. caridean shrimps), and those that lack any planktonic stage (e.g. the peracaridans such as the isopods). The summarized results of microhabitat surveys on Aldabra are presented, including a faunal list of 34 species, of which about 20 are probably undescribed. Divided into ecological categories, the highest species-diversity is seen in coral rubble sediments in the 6-25 m depth-range (20 species), with 15 species occurring in the shallow (0-6 m) rubble sediments. Shallow algal turfs (12 species) appear to harbor a higher diversity than deeper-occurring turfs (4 species). The understory in Thalassodendron seagrass beds yielded 13 species while a similar habitat in Thalassia seagrass yielded only four species. The genus Carpias (probably represented by a single species) occurred in almost all samples from all habitats, frequently in very high numbers. Species of this genus are undoubtedly ecologically important as a food source, especially for reef-dwelling fish. Comparison with the few localities that have been at all intensively studied seem to indicate that the Aldabran fauna (34 species) is depauperate. Carrie Bow Cay, Belize, and S.W. Madagascar, having all the same overall ecological microhabitats associated with coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangroves, have each yielded between 80 and 90 species of isopods. Isolation by deep water, and the lack of a planktonic stage for dispersal may to some degree explain this relatively poor Aldabran isopod fauna. Published studies on Crustacea from Aldabra have been sparse, and may be summarized as follows: Freshwater Entomostraca: McKenzie 1971, Wells & McKenzie 1973. Mysidacea: Ingle 1972. Decapod shrimps: Bruce 1972, 1978, 1984; Polunin & Lubbock 1977; Fricke & Fricke 1979. Terrestrial and freshwater decapods: Alexander 1979, Grub~ 1971, Hnatiuk 1980, Haig 1984. Burrowing Crustacea: Farrow 1970, 1971. For the Isopoda, other than papers dealing with the general Seychelles area (Stebbing 1910, Barnard 1925, Pires 1982), only three papers deal with material from AIdabra itself: Jones (1976) recorded four species of Cirolana; Spaull (1979) mentions terrestrial isopods occurring in soil and litter, but did not mention any taxa; Ferrara & Taiti (1985) recorded 13 species of terrestrial isopods, of which six were new. Thus, although a certain affinity with the tropical East African, Red Sea, and Madagascan fauna is to be expected, very few actual records exist. Material and Methods Isopod material covered in this paper comes from collecting stations ofthe author as well as several members of the various Smithsonian Institution teams that visited",1988,Bulletin of The Biological Society of Washington
"Winogradskyella undariae sp. nov., a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae isolated from a brown algae reservoir","A novel bacterial strain, designated WS-MY5T, capable of degrading a variety of polysaccharides was isolated from a brown algae (Undaria pinnatifida) reservoir at Wando in the South Sea, South Korea. Strain WS-MY5T was found to grow optimally at 30Â Â°C, at pH 7.0â€“7.5 and in the presence of 2Â % (w/v) NaCl. A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain WS-MY5T falls within the clade comprising Winogradskyella species, clustering with the type strains of Winogradskyellapacifica, Winogradskyellaarenosi, Winogradskyellarapida and Winogradskyellathalassocola, with which it exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 97.3â€“98.8Â %. It exhibited sequence similarity values of 93.0â€“96.2Â % to the type strains of the other recognized Winogradskyella species. Strain WS-MY5T was found to contain MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone and anteiso-C15:0, iso-C15:0, iso-C15:0 3-OH, iso-C17:0 3-OH and iso-C15:1 G as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids of strain WS-MY5T were identified as phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified lipids and two unidentified aminolipids. The DNA G+C content of strain WS-MY5T was determined to be 33.2Â mol% and its DNAâ€“DNA relatedness values with the type strains of W. pacifica, W. arenosi, W. rapida and W. thalassocola were in the range 16â€“28Â %. Differential phenotypic properties, together with its phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness, enabled strain WS-MY5T to be differentiated from the recognized Winogradskyella species. On the basis of the data presented here, strain WS-MY5T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Winogradskyella, for which the name Winogradskyella undariae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WS-MY5T (=KCTC 32261T=CCUG 63832T).",2013,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
[Ecological and toxicological experiments with test guppies and Daphnia in research on the effect of pesticides in water].,"Experiments have been carried out for the assessment of the toxic effect if some pesticides on aquatic organisms--fish groups Lebistes reticulatus and lower crustacea Daphnia magna. The following pesticides (herbicides) were studied--afalon, dimid, Lasso, patoran, propanide and Ramrod. Ramrod proved to have the highest toxicity, followed by propanide, Lasso and afalon. Dimid and patoran proved to have lower toxicity. Daphnia were established to be 10-17 times more susceptible than the fish groups.",1986,Problemi na khigienata
The Iso-lambda Descent Algorithm for the LASSO,"Following the introduction by Tibshirani of the LASSO tech- nique for feature selection in regression, two algorithms were proposed by Osborne et al. for solving the associated problem. One is an homo- topy method that gained popularity as the LASSO modication of the LARS algorithm. The other is a nite-step descent method that follows a path on the constraint polytope, and seems to have been largely ignored. One of the reason may be that it solves the constrained formulation of the LASSO, as opposed to the more practical regularized formulation. We give here an adaptation of this algorithm that solves the regularized problem, has a simpler formulation, and outperforms state-of-the-art al- gorithms in terms of speed.",2010,
Reconciliation in Times of Impunity: Challenges for Social Justice,"In human history there is no lack of malice, revenge, or savagery. The twentieth century has seen 33 million military deaths. Victimization deaths are estimated at six times that number, at 205 million people. The past decade has seen people enslaved, tortured, raped, and persecuted as members of political, racial, ethnic, or religious groups in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa. Yet we have not seen meaningful prosecution of crimes that have occurred on a massive scale. Former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights JosÃ© Ayala Lasso has stated that â€œa person stands a better chance of being tried and judged for killing one human being than for killing 100,000.â€ This paper examines reconciliation in the aftermath of protracted, deadly, wide scale conflict characterized by impunity when crimes against individuals, groups, and humanity go unpunished. It describes the relevance of moral exclusion theory to conflicts in which dehumanization and violence are normalized, and it argues that impunity is an urgent matter for psychology and social justice research.",2001,Social Justice Research
Structured Sparse Method for Hyperspectral Unmixing,"Hyperspectral Unmixing (HU) has received increasing attention in the past decades due to its ability of unveiling information latent in hyperspectral data. Unfortunately, most existing methods fail to take advantage of the spatial information in data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structured Sparse regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SS-NMF) method based on the following two aspects. First, we incorporate a graph Laplacian to encode the manifold structures embedded in the hyperspectral data space. In this way, the highly similar neighboring pixels can be grouped together. Second, the lasso penalty is employed in SS-NMF for the fact that pixels in the same manifold structure are sparsely mixed by a common set of relevant bases. These two factors act as a new structured sparse constraint. With this constraint, our method can learn a compact space, where highly similar pixels are grouped to share correlated sparse representations. Experiments on real hyperspectral data sets with different noise levels demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly.

Growth Factor-Dependent Proliferation and Invasion of Muscle Satellite Cells Require the Cell-Associated Fibrinolytic System,"Abstract The process of muscle regeneration in normal and dystrophic muscle depends on locally produced cytokines and growth factors and requires the activity of the urokinase plasminogen activator/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 system. In this study we tested the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factorÎ² (TGFÎ²) on the fibrinolytic pattern of normal and dystrophic satellite cells, their mitogenic and motogenic activities and the dependence of such activities on the cellassociated fibrinolytic system. We have observed that the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor is weakly upregulated by bFGF in normal satellite cells, while it is strongly upregulated by TGFÎ², mainly in dystrophic myoblasts. bFGF upregulated uPA in both normal and dystrophic myoblasts grown in primary culture, while a striking downregulation was observed with TGFÎ². TGFÎ² was the only growth factor able to exceptionally upregulate plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), mainly in dystrophic satellite cells. HGF did not show any activity on the fibrinolytic system. Proliferation and invasion into Matrigel matrices of normal and dystrophic cells occurred regardless of the growth factordependent regulation of the fibrinolytic system. Nevertheless, each growth factor required the efficiency of the constitutive cellassociated fibrinolytic system to operate, as shown by impairment of growth factor activity with antagonists of uPA and of its receptor. Noteworthy, TGFÎ² induced a dosedependent increase of Matrigel invasion only in dystrophic myoblasts. Since TGFÎ²challenged dystrophic myoblasts undergo an exceptional upregulation of the receptor and of PAI-1, we propose the possibility that the TGFÎ²induced fibrinolytic pattern (low urokinase plasminogen activator, high receptor and high PAI-1) may be exploited to promote survival and spreading of transplanted engineered myoblasts in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",2002,
Identification of compounds that target glioma initiating cells,"Glioblastoma multiforme is a common form of brain tumor that leads to debilitating effects despite the current regiment of treatment, which includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. With the discovery of glioma-initiating cells (GICs) that exists within the bulk tumor, some light has been shed on this disease. GICs have been shown to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, therefore providing a plausible explanation for the high propensity for recurrence in patients. However, effective treatments are still unavailable, and there is an urgency to discover drugs that can eradicate this group of cells. The overall aim of this thesis is to identify drugs from small molecule screens that can kill GICs, as well as to understand the possible causes and mechanisms for drug sensitivity. In Paper I, we have identified a new small molecule, Vacquinol-1, that reduced the viability and growth of GICs, both in vitro and in vivo, and had little effects on normal cells such as fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells. Cell death was caused by an unconventional nonapoptotic manner, where the cells showed massive accumulation of vacuoles that formed through macropinocytosis. This led to the impairment of cell function followed by cell death. Furthermore, treatment with Vacquinol-1 also exhibited excellent improvement in survival of glioma xenografted mice. Using an shRNA screen, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), which is involved in stress response, was determined to play a role in the unique type of cell death. In Paper II, we have identified that GICs are particularly sensitive to perturbations in calcium (Ca) homeostasis, with the relative degree of sensitivity being linked to their degree of stemness. The two compounds employed in this study, Ca ionophore A23187 and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) pump inhibitor Thapsigargin, are wellknown compounds that elicit cell death. However, the compounds affected viability to a different degree in the various GIC lines, with the line that is more similar to neural stem cells being more sensitive to perturbations in Ca homeostasis. This sensitivity was correlated to expression levels of different Ca related proteins such as GRIA1 and S100A6, as well as to Nestin (NES). In Paper III, we have repositioned Niguldipine, an old anti-hypertensive drug, as a potential compound for targeting GICs. Through an ion channel drug screen, we have also observed that GICs exhibit sensitivity to Ca modulators, suggesting once again that Ca homeostasis is critical to cell viability in GICs. Niguldipine, which is also a Ca channel inhibitor, also showed a selection for GICs as compared to normal cells such as fibroblasts and neural stem cells. At the effective dose, the compound showed no effects on cardiac rhythmicity, and administration of the drug resulted in a significant improvement in the survival of glioma xenografted mice. In conclusion, we have identified a few small molecules, both old and new, that can reduce the proliferation and viability of GICs without affecting that of normal cells. One of the mechanisms underlying selectivity is that GICs show a greater degree of sensitivity to disturbances in Ca homeostasis, therefore suggesting that Ca modulators should be screened for their potential in cancer therapy.

Estimation of Directed Acyclic Graphs Through Two-stage Adaptive Lasso for Gene Network Inference.,"Graphical models are a popular approach to find dependence and conditional independence relationships between gene expressions. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a special class of directed graphical models, where all the edges are directed edges and contain no directed cycles. The DAGs are well known models for discovering causal relationships between genes in gene regulatory networks. However, estimating DAGs without assuming known ordering is challenging due to high dimensionality, the acyclic constraints, and the presence of equivalence class from observational data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a two-stage adaptive Lasso approach, called NS-DIST, which performs neighborhood selection (NS) in stage 1, and then estimates DAGs by the Discrete Improving Search with Tabu (DIST) algorithm within the selected neighborhood. Simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and its computational efficiency. Two real data examples are used to demonstrate the practical usage of our method for gene regulatory network inference.",2016,Journal of the American Statistical Association
AIC for the group Lasso in generalized linear models,"When covariates are assumed to be clustered in groups in regression problems, the group Lasso is useful, because it tends to drive all the weights in one group to zero together. The group Lasso includes a tuning parameter which controls a penalty level, and an unbiased estimator of the true prediction error is derived as a $$C_p$$
 -type criterion to select an appropriate value of the tuning parameter. However, in general, the $$C_p$$
 -type criterion cannot be derived in generalized linear regressions such as a logistic regression. Hence, this paper obtains the AIC for the group Lasso based on its original definition under the framework of generalized linear models. In terms of computational cost, our criterion is clearly better than the cross validation, but it is shown through simulation studies that the performance of the our criterion is almost the same as or better than that of the cross validation.",2019,
Subspecific Status and Population Genetic Structure of Least Terns (Sternula antillarum) Inferred by Mitochondrial DNA Control-Region Sequences and Microsatellite DNA,"ABSTRACT. The taxonomic identity of endangered populations of the Least Tern (Sternula antillarum) has long been debated. Their current conservation status provides even more impetus to examine the taxonomic distinctness of these groups. We used rapidly evolving mitochondrial DNA control-region sequences (840 base pairs; n = 188) and microsatellite DNA data (7 loci; n = 417) to examine genetic structure within and among three subspecies that occur within the United States: California Least Tern (S. a. browni), Interior Least Tern (S. a. athalassos), and Eastern Least Tern (S. a. antillarum). Although significant genetic structure was observed among breeding populations from across the species' range, our data indicated little evidence of genetic structure within traditional subspecific groups. Isolation-by-distance analyses, however, identified subtle patterns that may reflect sex-specific differences in dispersal behavior. Our analyses likewise demonstrated little population subdivision among subspecific groups, which raises questions regarding the taxonomic status of traditionally defined subspecies. Our findings can therefore be used to consider a reevaluation of Least Tern subspecies by the American Ornithologists' Union's Committee on Taxonomy and Nomenclature. We further emphasize the need for studies of range-wide breeding-site fidelity and natal philopatry to better understand interpopulation movements of individuals throughout the annual cycle.",2010,
Sparse regression methods with measurement-error for magnetoencephalography,"Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging method for mapping brain activity based on magnetic field recordings. The inverse problem associated with MEG is severely ill-posed and is complicated by the presence of high collinearity in the forward (leadfield) matrix. This means that accurate source localisation can be challenging. The most commonly used methods for solving the MEG problem do not employ sparsity to help reduce the dimensions of the problem. In this thesis we review a number of the sparse regression methods that are widely used in statistics, as well as some more recent methods, and assess their performance in the context of MEG data. Due to the complexity of the forward model in MEG, the presence of measurement-error in the leadfield matrix can create issues in the spatial resolution of the data. Therefore we investigate the impact of measurement-error on sparse regression methods as well as how we can correct for it. We adapt the conditional score and simulation extrapolation (SIMEX) methods for use with sparse regression methods and build on an existing corrected lasso method to cover the elastic net penalty. These methods are demonstrated using a number of simulations for different types of measurement-error and are also tested with real MEG data. The measurement-error methods perform well in simulations, including high dimensional examples, where they are able to correct for attenuation bias in the true covariates. However the extent of their correction is much more restricted in the more complex MEG data where covariates are highly correlated and there is uncertainty over the distribution of the error.",2017,

Whether in response to the relatively recent impulses of the so-called ""new musicology"" or simply in an effort to seek a new direction for research, many musicologists are turning to multidisciplinary approaches and innovative research methods in their studies of music from the past. Even so, this trend has not completely eclipsed the more traditional analytical studies of the history of music, as can be seen in what appears to be an appropriate balance of ""newer"" and more ""old-fashioned"" research styles in the volume of essays entitled Hearing the Motet. This book presents sixteen papers, the majority of which were delivered at the February 1994 conference of the same name held at Washington University in St. Louis. Motets of both the Middle Ages and the Renaissance from late-twelfth-century Paris to beyond the Counter-Reformation are discussed using methodological approaches as varied as the works themselves. The publisher claims on the jacket that ""[i]n Hearing the Motet, top scholars in the field provide the fullest picture yet of the motet's 'music-poetic' nature, investigating the virtuosic interplay of music and text that distinguished some of the genre' s finest work and reading individual motets and motet repertories in ways that illuminate their historical and cultural backgrounds."" Indeed, this grand assertion is accurate in its emphasis on how the motet texts are employed in many of the essays to inform analyses of the accompanying music. With reference to the ""top scholars"" it must be noted that, although this volume is not an exhaustive representation of all current motet research, the impressive list of contributors to Hearing the Motet appears almost like a ""who's who"" of motet researchers. In the lengthy introduction (nine pages), editor Dolores Pesce remarks briefly on the nature of the conference Hearing the Motet from where this volume grew, and provides details of style and content for each paper. (Pesce's introduction could conceivably appear as a stand-alone positive and sympathetic book review.)

Community structure and PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase genes of a marine pyrene-degrading microbial consortium,"Marine microbial consortium UBF, enriched from a beach polluted by the Prestige oil spill and highly efficient in degrading this heavy fuel, was subcultured in pyrene minimal medium. The pyrene-degrading subpopulation (UBF-Py) mineralized 31Â % of pyrene without accumulation of partially oxidized intermediates indicating the cooperation of different microbial components in substrate mineralization. The microbial community composition was characterized by culture dependent and PCR based methods (PCR-DGGE and clone libraries). Molecular analyses showed a highly stable community composed by Alphaproteobacteria (84Â %, Breoghania, Thalassospira, Paracoccus, and Martelella) and Actinobacteria (16Â %, Gordonia). The members of Thalasosspira and Gordonia were not recovered as pure cultures, but five additional strains, not detected in the molecular analysis, that classified within the genera Novosphingobium, Sphingopyxis, Aurantimonas (Alphaproteobacteria), Alcanivorax (Gammaproteobacteria) and Micrococcus (Actinobacteria), were isolated. None of the isolates degraded pyrene or other PAHs in pure culture. PCR amplification of Gram-positive and Gram-negative dioxygenase genes did not produce results with any of the cultured strains. However, sequences related to the NidA3 pyrene dioxygenase present in mycobacterial strains were detected in UBF-Py consortium, suggesting the representative of Gordonia as the key pyrene degrader, which is consistent with a preeminent role of actinobacteria in pyrene removal in coastal environments affected by marine oil spills.",2013,Biodegradation

Elm anâ€™s sim ulation is a response to M arcus et al.â€™s (1999) experim ent w ith infants; specifically their ability to differentiate betw een novel sequences of syllables of the form A BA and A BB. Elm an contends that SRN s can learn to generalize to novel stim uli, just as M arcus et alâ€™s infants did. H ow ever, w e believe that Elm anâ€™s conclusions are overstated. Specifically, w e perform ed large batch experim ents involving sim ple recurrent netw orks w ith differing data sets. O ur results show ed that SRN s are m uch less successful than Elm an asserted, although there is a w eak tendency for netw orks to respond m eaningfully, rather than random ly, to input stim uli. Introduction In a recent paper, Elm an (1999) casts doubt upon the w idely noted results of M arcus et al. (1999). In the M arcus et al.â€™s experim ent, 7-m onth old infants w ere habituated to sequences of syllables of the form A BA or A BB (e.g., â€œw e di w eâ€ or â€œle di diâ€). M arcus et al. found that infants show ed an attentional preference for novel test sequences of syllables (w hich w e call â€œsentencesâ€), w hich differed from the habituation stim uli 1 . M arcus et al. argue that the reason for this behavior is the fact that infants extracted â€œalgebra-like rules that represent relationships between placeholders (variables)â€ (1999). They also concluded that sim ple recurrent networks (and, in general, all netw orks w hose training is based on backpropagation of error) were not able to display this kind of behavior because they could not generalize outside the training space. The issue of generalization outside the training space w as previously addressed in N iklasson and van G elder (1994), and M arcus (1998). In essence, the training space represents the n-dim ensional hyperplane delim ited by the set of training vectors. W e say that a connectionist m odel generalizes to novel stim uli w hen correct output is reliably produced for an input item that For exam ple, after habituated to A BA sequences, the infants spent m ore tim e recognizing novel test sequences of the form A BB than did for A BA sequences, and vice versa. w as not included in the training set (i.e., the netw ork w as never trained on that stim ulus in any position w ithin its input layer). M arcus m aintains that a neural netw ork trained w ith the backpropagation algorithm (or any variant of it) is not able to display such a behavior, because the innate structure of the backpropagation algorithm 2 precludes the netw ork from generalizing to nodes that have not been specifically trained. Elm an agrees that the M arcus experim ent does â€œindicate that infants discrim inated the difference between the tw o types of sequencesâ€ (1999), but he believes that this result m ay be explained by the relationship between the last tw o syllables: infants were able to distinguish that in one case the last two syllables w ere identical (A BB), and in the other case the last tw o syllables w ere different (A BA ). M oreover, Elm an m aintains that it is feasible for a sim ple recurrent netw ork to perform this sam e task, provided the netw ork is presented w ith the sam e background know ledge as infants have (in particular, an exposure to a wide range of syllables that infants have before participating in the experim ent). H aving said that, Elm an perform s an experim ent involving an SRN that aim s to sim ulate the M arcus et al.â€™s experim ent. There are three phases in Elm anâ€™s sim ulation: 1) the pre-training period, corresponding to the prior experience of the infants in learning to recognize syllables; 2) a second phase corresponding to the habituation task that infants encountered (presenting A BA and A BB sentences); 3) a testing phase involving novel stim uli, as in the infantsâ€™ experim ent. A t the end of his sim ulation, Elm an concludes that his results â€œclearly indicate that the netw ork learned to extend the A BA vs. A BB generalization to novel stim uliâ€ (1999). G ranting Elm anâ€™s basic assum ptions, w e constructed an experim ent that m im ics his sim ulation. W e did not The w eights connecting a given output node are trained independently of the w eights connecting any other output node. Consequently, the set of w eights connecting one output unit to its input units is entirely independent of the set of w eights feeding all other output units. This is called input- output independence, and it is believed to be the m ajor w eak point of backpropagation neural netw orks. It is less clear that the problem arises for com petitive learning netw orks, how ever. See H adley et al (1998) for details.",2001,

Non-convex penalized estimation in high-dimensional models with single-index structure,"As promising alternatives to the LASSO, non-convex penalized methods, such as the SCAD and the minimax concave penalty method, produce asymptotically unbiased shrinkage estimates. By adopting non-convex penalties, in this paper we investigate uniformly variable selection and shrinkage estimation for several parametric and semi-parametric models with single-index structure. The new method does not need to estimate the involved nonparametric transformation or link function. The resulting estimators enjoy the oracle property even in the ''large p, small n'' scenario. The theoretical results for linear models are in parallel extended to general single-index models with no distribution constraint for the error at the cost of mild conditions on the predictors. Simulation studies are carried out to examine the performance of the proposed method and a real data analysis is also presented for illustration.",2012,J. Multivar. Anal.

Incorporating Additional Constraints in Sparse Estimation,"Abstract It is well known that a linear regression can benefit from knowledge that the underlying regression vector is sparse. The combinatorial problem of selecting the nonzero components of this vector can be relaxed by regularizing the squared error with a convex penalty function like the l 1 norm. However, in many applications, additional conditions on the structure of the regression vector and its sparsity pattern are available. Incorporating this information into the learning method may lead to a significant decrease of the estimation error. In this paper, we review a recently proposed family of convex penalty functions, which encode prior knowledge on the structure of the vector formed by the absolute values of the regression coefficients. This family subsumes the l 1 norm and is flexible enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical and theoretical importance. We discuss special cases of these penalty functions in which the regularized empirical error function can be efficiently minimized by a proximal-point method. We compare this method to a previous method based on block coordinate descent and present numerical experiments which highlight the benefit of our framework over a greedy approach and the Lasso method.",2012,IFAC Proceedings Volumes
Expectation-maximization Gaussian-mixture approximate message passing,"When recovering a sparse signal from noisy compressive linear measurements, the distribution of the signal's non-zero coefficients can have a profound affect on recovery mean-squared error (MSE). If this distribution was apriori known, one could use efficient approximate message passing (AMP) techniques for nearly minimum MSE (MMSE) recovery. In practice, though, the distribution is unknown, motivating the use of robust algorithms like Lasso-which is nearly minimax optimal-at the cost of significantly larger MSE for non-least-favorable distributions. As an alternative, we propose an empirical-Bayesian technique that simultaneously learns the signal distribution while MMSE-recovering the signal-according to the learned distribution-using AMP. In particular, we model the non-zero distribution as a Gaussian mixture, and learn its parameters through expectation maximization, using AMP to implement the expectation step. Numerical experiments confirm the state-of-the-art performance of our approach on a range of signal classes.",2012,2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)
Screening Rules for Overlapping Group Lasso,"Recently, to solve large-scale lasso and group lasso problems, screening rules have been developed, the goal of which is to reduce the problem size by efficiently discarding zero coefficients using simple rules independently of the others. However, screening for overlapping group lasso remains an open challenge because the overlaps between groups make it infeasible to test each group independently. In this paper, we develop screening rules for overlapping group lasso. To address the challenge arising from groups with overlaps, we take into account overlapping groups only if they are inclusive of the group being tested, and then we derive screening rules, adopting the dual polytope projection approach. This strategy allows us to screen each group independently of each other. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of our screening rules on various datasets.",2014,ArXiv
Lasso-based Variable Selection of ARMA Models,"This study considers a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso)based approach to variable selection of ARMA models. We first show that the Lasso estimator follows the Knight-Fuâ€™s limit distribution under a general tuning parameter assumption. With a special restriction on the tuning parameters, we show that the Lasso estimator achieves the â€œoracleâ€ properties: zero parameters are estimated to be zero exactly, and other estimators are as efficient as those under the true model. The results are extended further for nonstationary ARMA models, and an algorithm is presented. In particular, we propose a data-driven information criterion to select the tuning parameter that is shown to be consistent with probability approaching one. A simulation study is carried out to assess the performance of the proposed procedure, and an example is provided to demonstrate its applicability.",2020,Statistica Sinica

Monitoring of Physical Development of Vocational and Technical School Students,"IntroductionThe reformation of vocational education with a big flow of information, the intensification of training activities and the transition from the traditional educational process to the one with innovative technologies significantly increases the demands on the health of students, and often noncompliance of hygienic rules and regulation of educational process is reflected on a more valuable - children's health (Shubochkina, E.I., Kulikova, A.V, 2010).It's important to know the features of the students' health, and living conditions that may have adverse effect on health during their vocational training. Considering the fact that during the most manifested growth and development organism is extremely sensitive to the influence of social factors and decreased attention to social issues during the destabilization of the state, limited funding for preventive orientation in health care lead to loss of control over students' health (Prader, A.N., Largo, R.H., 2011).As a means of health managing in an educational institution considered monitoring studies. It can detect hygienic, medical, psychological and pedagogical shortcomings of the educational process and identify key areas of preventive and corrective activities. A monitoring allows to establish causal relationships of different pedagogical actions and dynamics of the students' health (Shubochkina, E.I., Lunkin, A.N., 2010).One of integrative child health indicators, biological maturity of all body systems is physical development (PD). It is considered the most important characteristic of the child's health, as is a set of morphological and functional properties of an organism and determines the stock of physical strength, endurance and work performance (Birnbaum, A.S., Linver, M.R., 2012).The state of PD of children of a certain age is the basis for predicting the emergence of diseases, which will affect the quality of life for subsequent years. The more significant violations in the PD, the greater are probability of the disease emergence (Lazarus, T.N., Kelechi U.S., 2011).It is known that the PD is affected by two main groups of factors: endogenous (genotype, the nervous and endocrine systems) and exogenous (climate and environmental impacts, food, a set of social conditions) (Saris, W. H. Niklasson, A.T., 2011).PD is a sensitive indicator that is easy to change under the influence of various adverse factors, particularly environmental conditions. As a set of features that characterize the state of health of the body at different age, the level of PD is one of the most important indicators of social health and is an objective indicator of sanitary-epidemiological condition (Korobchanskiy, V.O., Vasylchenko, I.O, Vytrishak, S.V., 2008).While causes of impairments of vocational-technical schools' (VTS) students are multifactorial, the leading are factors specific for the educational process - increasing volume and intensification of training load. Beside general educational load vocational students are accompanied by the study of special subjects and skills development, due to the effect on the vocational factors. Significant adverse effects on the health of adolescents is provided by social and psychological factors, poor nutrition, lack of sleep, psychological stress in families, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol and drug use, early labor employment and others. (Molodcov, S.A., Kamaev, I.A., 2001).Therefore, at the present stage actual problem is development and implementation of monitoring technology as the obligatory one for creating a favorable environment for the development of students with health-saving functions (Ponomaryova, L.I., Mejybetskaya, I.V., 2014).ObjectiveThe aim of the study was to determine the characteristics of the PD of VTS by gender, age and specialty that are mastered.Materials and methodsMonitoring of PD of students was performed during a comprehensive medical examination of adolescents in the process of education. â€¦",2016,Journal of physical education and sport
A Generic Path Algorithm for Regularized Statistical Estimation.,"Regularization is widely used in statistics and machine learning to prevent overfitting and gear solution towards prior information. In general, a regularized estimation problem minimizes the sum of a loss function and a penalty term. The penalty term is usually weighted by a tuning parameter and encourages certain constraints on the parameters to be estimated. Particular choices of constraints lead to the popular lasso, fused-lasso, and other generalized â„“1 penalized regression methods. In this article we follow a recent idea by Wu (2011, 2012) and propose an exact path solver based on ordinary differential equations (EPSODE) that works for any convex loss function and can deal with generalized â„“1 penalties as well as more complicated regularization such as inequality constraints encountered in shape-restricted regressions and nonparametric density estimation. Non-asymptotic error bounds for the equality regularized estimates are derived. In practice, the EPSODE can be coupled with AIC, BIC, Cp or cross-validation to select an optimal tuning parameter, or provides a convenient model space for performing model averaging or aggregation. Our applications to generalized â„“1 regularized generalized linear models, shape-restricted regressions, Gaussian graphical models, and nonparametric density estimation showcase the potential of the EPSODE algorithm.",2014,Journal of the American Statistical Association
[Control of the morphogenetic steady state in the polyps of Hydractinia echinata : I. Biological-experimental studies].,"1. At any axial level in the polyps the potencies to regenerate basal parts are suppressed, while apical regions can be regenerated. If regenerative formations occur at the basal end at all, they will become apical structures leading to bipolar forms with symmetrical axial pattern. 2. The probability of such heteropolar development is positively correlated to the distance between the apical pole and the basal cut. Moreover, the probability rises, at all distances, after removal of the hypostomes, which, therefore, are interpreted as being in a position of dominance. 3. The lag between amputation and the appearance of new tentacles increases from apex to base. This gradient, being less steep for heteropolar regeneration, ensures that the apical primordium normally will get a start to win the position of dominance. Accordingly the rate of heteropolarity rises after removing or destroying the apical primordium within 3-12 h after amputation of the hypostome. 4. The polar pattern of potencies changes after dissociation of tissue. Reaggregated cellassociations develop stolons, whereas the potency of stolon formation proves to be stably suppressed in all parts of intact polyps. This potency is released also after operative displacement of the polar axis by 90Â°. 5. Induction phenomena occur when two regions of different and distant axial level are brought into contact, either by transplantation or by parabiosis. The induced formations develop those axial regions that normally are located between the two combined regions. 6. In several experiments, including parabiosis combinations, implanting of marks and autoradiographic studies, the inductive system was shown to consist of two components: a) The apical system, the vector of which is directed from apex to base: regions above the stationary zone bring about the development of structures in more basal levels, that may occur spontaneously in regeneration and that belong to higher axial levels. b) The basal system, directed from base to apex: the hydrorhiza induces, in regions in which the tissue movement is orientated basally (regions below the stationary zone), structures the properties of which are characteristic of deeper axial levels and that can not be regenerated. The vectors of the inductive streams, therefore, are opposed to the vectors of tissue movement during steady state growth. After disconnecting the junction to the hydrorhiza, that is the source of the basal inductive stimulus, the basally directed stream of cellular material dies down. 7. Following ideas of gene physiology a model of the process regulating differentiation can be constructed, which will describe the development of polar patterns in regeneration, induction phenomena, budding and steady state growth, and which may attribute all morphogenetic processes to the same mechanisms of control. These mechanisms include activators as well as blocking factors subjected to the activating stimuli. The assumption of gradients established by diffusible substances is not implicitely necessary.",1969,Wilhelm Roux' Archiv fur Entwicklungsmechanik der Organismen
Incorporating term selection into nonlinear block structured system identification,"Subset selection and shrinkage methods locate and remove insignificant terms from identified models. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) is a term selection method that shrinks some coefficients and sets others to zero. In this paper, the incorporation of constraints (such as Lasso) into the linear and/or nonlinear parts of a Separable Nonlinear Least Squares algorithm is addressed and its application to the identification of block-structured models is considered. As an example, this method is applied to a Hammerstein model consisting of a nonlinear static block, represented by a Tchebyshev polynomial, in series with a linear dynamic system, modeled by a bank of Laguerre filters. Simulations showed that the Lasso based method was able to identify the model structure correctly, or with mild over-modeling, even in the presence of significant output noise.",2010,Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference
LASSOâ€”ligand activity by surface similarity order: a new tool for ligand based virtual screening,"Virtual Ligand Screening (VLS) has become an integral part of the drug discovery process for many pharmaceutical companies. Ligand similarity searches provide a very powerful method of screening large databases of ligands to identify possible hits. If these hits belong to new chemotypes the method is deemed even more successful. eHiTS LASSO uses a new interacting surface point types (ISPT) molecular descriptor that is generated from the 3D structure of the ligand, but unlike most 3D descriptors it is conformation independent. Combined with a neural network machine learning technique, LASSO screens molecular databases at an ultra fast speed of 1Â million structures in under 1Â min on a standard PC. The results obtained from eHiTS LASSO trained on relatively small training sets of just 2, 4 or 8 actives are presented using the diverse directory of useful decoys (DUD) dataset. It is shown that over a wide range of receptor families, eHiTS LASSO is consistently able to enrich screened databases and provides scaffold hopping ability.",2008,Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design
"Highly explosive eruption of the monogenetic 8.6 ka BP La Vache et Lassolas scoria cone complex (ChaÃ®ne des Puys, France)","Abstract The eruption of the trachy-basaltic La Vache and Lassolas cone complex was the youngest eruption (ca. 8.6Â ka BP) and one of the most violent in the Chaine des Puys, France. Here we present field data and results of grain size, componentry and clast density measurements of different layers of the widespread tephra deposit that is associated with this cone-forming eruption. Our data indicates five main eruption phases comprising a vent-opening phase, a second sustained highly explosive phase, a third and fourth violent Strombolian phase and a fifth dominantly effusive phase. The layer formed by the opening phase is rich in lithic material, which was previously considered to be the result of phreatomagmatic activity. The data presented here on the componentry and textures of the pyroclastic material contradict this hypothesis. We propose instead that the material of the basal layer results from fragmentation caused by the explosion of a first arriving gas-dominated phase. The variations in eruption intensity during the main eruption phases are interpreted here to be the result of gas segregation within the plumbing system and fluxes in the magma ascent rate during the eruption. Significant amount of gas segregation is indicated by the deposition of both gas-poor and gas-rich material and by the presence of plate tephra. This is also supported by the simultaneous ejection of tephra and lava from both cones during most of the explosive activity. We suggest that gas segregation occurred within shallow intrusions and that fresh ascending material in the main conduit mixed with degassed material that flow back into the conduit from the intrusion before fragmentation. The interaction of the ascending magma and the opening of intrusions may have controlled the evolution and explosivity of the eruption. The high explosivity at the beginning of the eruption and the wide dispersal area, demonstrate that scoria cone eruptions in monogenetic fields can impose a major threat to the population and infrastructures nearby as these events may occur with little warning, and therefore research on this kind of eruptions is of a major importance to better understand the processes driving these events.",2016,Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research
Web-based Supplementary Materials for â€œ Biclustering via Sparse Singular Value Decomposition â€,"In this section, we report one additional simulation study where the nonzero entries of the true signal matrix are all the same. In addition to comparing SSVD with SVD, Plaid (Lazzeroni and Owen, 2002) and RoBiC (Asgarian and Greiner, 2008), we also investigate how the adaptive lasso weight parameters Î³1 and Î³2 affect the performance of SSVD. For this simulation, we consider as the truth a 100Ã—50 matrix Xâˆ— whose nonzero entries are the same. This is the simplest example because every nonzero element of Xâˆ— is the same, and hence is equally likely to be chosen by a sparse procedure.",2009,
[Prognosis in meningococcal disease: methodology and practice].,"78 patients with systemic meningococcal disease admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the 2nd Moscow Hospital for Infectious Diseases were studied and the composite prognostic score was developed to estimate the risk of lethal outcome. The stepwise variable selection procedure for the multiple logistic regression was applied to 30 potential clinical and laboratory risk factors and markers. Five factors were selected for the score, namely the platelet count (< 150 x 10(6)/ml), the presence of hemorrhages into the eye or mucosal tissue, the interval from the last urination before admission (> 4 h), the respiration rate (> 170% of age-adjusted normal value) and age (< 2 or > 65 years) with regression coefficients 0.3, 0.2, 0.2 and 0.1, respectively. Both for the source clinical group and for the additional test group (64 patients), the scale was able to classify correctly 95% of cases using the data collected at admission. Ten prognostic scores proposed previously by foreign investigators were tested in the same patients and the best four scores were selected (GMSPS, Gedde-Dahl, Niklasson, Kahn); the scores classified correctly 85-90% of cases. This study is an example of methodological approaches to prognostic score construction in medicine.",1999,Klinicheskaia meditsina
Network-Based Measures as Leading Indicators of Market Instability: The Case of the Spanish Stock Market,"This paper studies the undirected partial-correlation stock network for the Spanish market that considers the constituents of IBEX-35 as nodes and their partial correlations of returns as links. I propose a novel methodology that combines a recently developed variable selection method, Graphical Lasso, with Monte Carlo simulations as fundamental ingredients for the estimation recipe. Three major results come from this study. First, in topological terms, the network shows features that are not consistent with random arrangements and it also presents a high level of stability over time. International comparison between major European stock markets extends that conclusion beyond the Spanish context. Second, the systemic importance of the banking sector, relative to the other sectors in the economy, is quantitatively uncovered by means of its network centrality. Particularly interesting is the case of the two major banks that occupy the places of the most systemic players. Finally, the empirical evidence indicates that some network-based measures are leading indicators of distress for the Spanish stock market.",2015,
Feature Selection for Thermal Comfort Modeling based on Constrained LASSO Regression,"Abstract Thermal comfort is influenced by many factors and can vary significantly between different individuals. Therefore, modeling personal thermal comfort is a complex challenge and requires a detailed knowledge about environmental as well as physical or even mental conditions of an occupant. However, only limited data are available which is usually restricted to environmental measurements. Furthermore in the context of commercial buildings, the calculation effort must be kept as low as possible that scaling issues related to the large number of occupants are reduced. To cope with this problem, the presented paper analyzes thermal sensation voting data collected in an open-plan office in Singapore and uses LASSO regression techniques for the identification of the most important comfort features. Well known relations between thermal comfort and the corresponding vote are considered via suitable constraints. To define a common set of optimal features, the individual regression problem is extended to an arbitrary number of occupants. This leads to multiple LASSO optimization problems that are coupled by nonlinear if-statements. A reformulation method is presented which results in a mixed integer quadratic program by introducing binary activation variables. Eventually, the method is applied to comfort modeling and the resulting model structures are compared regarding their complexity, number of selected features and prediction accuracy.",2019,IFAC-PapersOnLine
A variable informative criterion based on weighted voting strategy combined with LASSO for variable selection in multivariate calibration,"Abstract High-throughput spectra data with large number of variables (wavelength) will make the prediction of multivariate calibration model unreliable, in which case, the sparse statistical methods such as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) are gradually being valued by researchers. In this study, a novel variable informative criterion based on weighted voting strategy combined with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (WV-LASSO) has been proposed. Monte Carlo Sampling (MCS) is used for generating a large number of sub-models. In each Monte Carlo circulation, the regression coefficients and variable selection information of LASSO model will be recorded. In the present work, weighted voting strategy based on regression coefficients information combined with selected variable frequency of all sub-models is used for evaluating the importance of variable. Different from specific methods, variable informative (importance) criterion can be more extensive and flexible for algorithm design. Then an approach called exponentially decreasing function (EDF) is applied to create a variable selection method with WV-LASSO. The performance of this method was evaluated by three near-infrared (NIR) datasets. Compared with some efficient variable selection methods based on different informative criterions including variable importance projection (VIP), Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination (MC-UVE), randomization test (RT), competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (SCARS), variable iterative space shrinkage approach (VISSA), interval variable iterative space shrinkage approach (iVISSA), LASSO coupled with sampling error profile analysis (SEPA-LASSO) and variable combination population analysis (VCPA), and so forth, the variable selection method proposed in this paper shows better prediction and interpretation ability and has potential for constructing various variable selection methods by combining other selection strategies.",2019,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems
Targeted Metabolomic Profiling of Plasma and Survival in Heart Failure Patients.,"OBJECTIVES
This study sought to derive and validate plasma metabolite associations with survival in heart failure (HF) patients.


BACKGROUND
Profiling of plasma metabolites to predict the course of HF appears promising, butÂ validation and incremental value of these profiles are less established.


METHODS
Patients (nÂ = 1,032) who met Framingham HF criteria with a history of reduced ejection fraction were randomly divided into derivation and validation cohorts (nÂ = 516 each). Amino acids, organic acids, and acylcarnitines were quantified using mass spectrometry in fasting plasma samples. We derived a prognostic metabolite profile (PMP) in the derivation cohort using Lasso-penalized Cox regression. Validity was assessed by 10-fold cross validation in the derivation cohort and by standard testing in the validation cohort. The PMP was analyzed as both a continuous variable (PMPscore) and dichotomized at the median (PMPcat), in univariate and multivariate models adjusted for clinical risk score and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide.


RESULTS
Overall, 48% of patients were African American, 35% were women, and the average age was 69 years. AfterÂ aÂ median follow-up of 34 months, there were 256 deaths (127 and 129 in derivation and validation cohorts, respectively). Optimized modeling defined the 13 metabolite PMPs, which was cross validated as both the PMPscore (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.27; pÂ < 2Â Ã— 10-16) and PMPcat (HR: 3.04; pÂ = 2.93Â Ã— 10-8). The validation cohort showed similar results (PMPscore HR: 3.9; pÂ < 2Â Ã— 10-16 and PMPcat HR: 3.99; pÂ = 3.47Â Ã— 10-9). In adjusted models, PMP remained associated with mortality in the cross-validated derivation cohort (PMPscore HR: 1.63; pÂ = 0.0029; PMPcat HR: 1.47; pÂ =Â 0.081) and the validation cohort (PMPscore HR: 1.54; pÂ = 0.037; PMPcat HR: 1.69; pÂ = 0.043).


CONCLUSIONS
Plasma metabolite profiles varied across HF subgroups and were associated with survival incrementalÂ to conventional predictors. Additional investigation is warranted to define mechanisms and clinical applications.",2017,JACC. Heart failure
"Tistlia consotensis gen. nov., sp. nov., an aerobic, chemoheterotrophic, free-living, nitrogen-fixing alphaproteobacterium, isolated from a Colombian saline spring.","A Gram-negative, aerobic, mesophilic, non-spore-forming, chemotrophic, chlorophyll-lacking, nitrogen-fixing bacterium, designated strain USBA 355(T), was isolated from the saline spring 'Salado de ConsotÃ¡' situated in the Colombian Andes. The non-flagellated cells of strain USBA 355(T) were straight to slightly curved rods (0.6-0.7 x 3.0-3.5 microm). Growth occurred optimally at 30 degrees C (growth temperature range between 20 and 40 degrees C), at pH 6.5-6.7 (pH growth range between 5.0 and 8.0) and at 0.5 % NaCl (w/v) (range between 0 and 4 %). The major quinone present was Q-10 and the predominant fatty acids identified were C(19 : 0) cyclo omega8c, C(18 : 1)omega7c and C(18 : 0). The G+C content of the chromosomal DNA was 71+/-1 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain USBA 355(T) formed a distant phylogenetic line of descent with members of the genus Thalassobaculum, family Rhodospirillaceae, class Alphaproteobacteria (90 % gene sequence similarity). Comparison of the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and physiological features of strain USBA 355(T) with all other members of the family Rhodospirillaceae suggested that it represents a novel genus and species for which the name Tistlia consotensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is USBA 355(T) (=JCM 15529(T)=KCTC 22406(T)).",2010,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Female Mimicry by Sneaker Males Has a Transcriptomic Signature in Both the Brain and the Gonad in a Sex-Changing Fish,"Phenotypic plasticity represents an elegant adaptive response of individuals to a change in their environment. Bluehead wrasses (Thalassoma bifasciatum) exhibit astonishing sexual plasticity, including female-to-male sex change and discrete male morphs that differ strikingly in behavior, morphology, and gonadal investment. Using RNA-seq transcriptome profiling, we examined the genes and physiological pathways underlying flexible behavioral and gonadal differences among female, dominant (bourgeois) male, and female-mimic (sneaker) male blueheads. For the first time in any organism, we find that female mimicry by sneaker males has a transcriptional signature in both the brain and the gonad. Sneaker males shared striking similarity in neural gene expression with females, supporting the idea that males with alternative reproductive phenotypes have ""female-like brains."" Sneaker males also overexpressed neuroplasticity genes, suggesting that their opportunistic reproductive strategy requires a heightened capacity for neuroplasticity. Bourgeois males overexpressed genes associated with socio-sexual behaviors (e.g., isotocin), but also neuroprotective genes and biomarkers of oxidative stress and aging, indicating a hitherto unexplored cost to these males of attaining the reproductively privileged position at the top of the social hierarchy. Our novel comparison of testicular transcriptomes in a fish with male sexual polymorphism associates greater gonadal investment by sneaker males with overexpression of genes involved in cell proliferation and sperm quality control. We propose that morphological female-mimicry by sneaker male teleosts entails pervasive downregulation of androgenesis genes, consistent with low androgen production in males lacking well-developed secondary sexual characters.",2018,Molecular Biology and Evolution
"Diversity and Distribution of Fishes along the Depth Gradient of a Coral Reef Wall at San AndrÃ©s Island, Colombian Caribbean","""Blue Wall"", in San Andres Island (Colombia), is an outer reef slope with an inclination that increases with depth to nearly 90Â°. Such a steep gradient facilitates the identification of patterns of variation in species abundance and diversity along depth. To document such patterns in fishes associated with this habitat, 30 visual censuses were conducted along 30 x 2 m transects, located at 5 m intervals between 5-30 m depth, in which the abundance and diversity of species was estimated. A total of 2916 individuals belonging to 46 species from 21 families were recorded within transects. Ten additional species were observed outside of transects for a total richness of 56 species. The dominant species were Canthigaster rostrata, Chromis cyanea, Stegastes partitus, Thalassoma bifasciatum and Clepticus parrae, which together with four other species accounted for 92% of the total abundance. Several of these dominant species are planktivorous and abundant throughout the Caribbean and had broad ranges of vertical distribution with abundance peaks in different parts of the depth gradient. In general, there was a positive correlation between average abundance and breadth of depth distribution. Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling analysis revealed distinct assemblages at each depth, which also differed significantly, but weakly, in their diversity and dominance, but not in their species richness and evenness. Shallow assemblages were clearly distinctive from deep ones, with greater differentiation between shallower than between deeper assemblages. We conclude that the fish assemblage at ""Blue Wall"" exhibits a structural order that can be explained, in part, by depth and that reef walls offer an excellent opportunity to examine processes responsible for patterns of community structure in coral reef fishes.",2016,
Comparable variable selection with Lasso,"P-values are being computed for increasingly complicated statistics but lacking evaluations on their quality. Meanwhile, accurate p-values enable significance comparison across batches of hypothesis tests and consequently unified false discover rate (FDR) control. This article discusses two related questions in this setting. First, we propose statistical tests to evaluate the quality of p-value and the cross-batch comparability of any other statistic. Second, we propose a lasso based variable selection statistic, based on when the predictor variable first becomes active, and compute its p-value to achieve unified FDR control across multiple selections. In the end, we apply our tests on covTest, selectiveInference, and our statistic, based on real and null datasets for network inference in normal and high-dimensional settings. Results demonstrate higher p-value quality from our statistic and reveal p-value errors from others hidden before. We implement our statistic as lassopv in R.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Auditory spatial localization: Developmental delay in children with visual impairments.,"For individuals with visual impairments, auditory spatial localization is one of the most important features to navigate in the environment. Many works suggest that blind adults show similar or even enhanced performance for localization of auditory cues compared to sighted adults (Collignon, Voss, Lassonde, & Lepore, 2009). To date, the investigation of auditory spatial localization in children with visual impairments has provided contrasting results. Here we report, for the first time, that contrary to visually impaired adults, children with low vision or total blindness show a significant impairment in the localization of static sounds. These results suggest that simple auditory spatial tasks are compromised in children, and that this capacity recovers over time.",2016,Research in developmental disabilities
An orthogonal system for heterologous expression of actinobacterial lasso peptides in Streptomyces hosts,"Lasso peptides are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides produced by bacteria. They are characterized by an unusual lariat-knot structure. Targeted genome scanning revealed a wide diversity of lasso peptides encoded in actinobacterial genomes, but cloning and heterologous expression of these clusters turned out to be problematic. To circumvent this, we developed an orthogonal expression system for heterologous production of actinobacterial lasso peptides in Streptomyces hosts based on a newly-identified regulatory circuit from Actinoalloteichus fjordicus. Six lasso peptide gene clusters, mainly originating from marine Actinobacteria, were chosen for proof-of-concept studies. By varying the Streptomyces expression hosts and a small set of culture conditions, three new lasso peptides were successfully produced and characterized by tandem MS. The newly developed expression system thus sets the stage to uncover and bioengineer the chemo-diversity of actinobacterial lasso peptides. Moreover, our data provide some considerations for future bioprospecting efforts for such peptides.",2018,Scientific Reports
Radiomics analysis on T2-MR image to predict lymphovascular space invasion in cervical cancer,"Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) is an important determinant for selecting treatment plan in cervical cancer (CC). For CC patients without LVSI, conization is recommended; otherwise, if LVSI is observed, hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection are required. Despite the importance, current identification of LVSI can only be obtained by pathological examination through invasive biopsy or after surgery. In this study, we provided a non-invasive and preoperative method to identify LVSI by radiomics analysis on T2-magnetic resonance image (MRI), aiming at assisting personalized treatment planning. We enrolled 120 CC patients with T2 image and clinical information, and allocated them into a training set (n = 80) and a testing set (n= 40) according to the diagnostic time. Afterwards, 839 image features were extracted to reflect the intensity, shape, and high-dimensional texture information of CC. Among the 839 radiomic features, 3 features were identified to be discriminative by Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso)-Logistic regression. Finally, we built a support vector machine (SVM) to predict LVSI status by the 3 radiomic features. In the independent testing set, the radiomics model achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7356, classification accuracy of 0.7287. The radiomics signature showed significant difference between non-LVSI and LVSI patients (p<0.05). Furthermore, we compared the radiomics model with clinical model that uses clinical information, and the radiomics model showed significant improvement than clinical factors (AUC=0.5967 in the validation cohort for clinical model).",2019,
Variable Selection with Copula Entropy,"Variable selection is of significant importance for classification and regression tasks in machine learning and statistical applications where both predictability and explainability are needed. In this paper, a Copula Entropy (CE) based method for variable selection which use CE based ranks to select variables is proposed. The method is both model-free and tuning-free. Comparison experiments between the proposed method and traditional variable selection methods, such as Stepwise Selection, regularized generalized linear models and Adaptive LASSO, were conducted on the UCI heart disease data. Experimental results show that CE based method can select the `right' variables out effectively and derive better interpretable results than traditional methods do without sacrificing accuracy performance. It is believed that CE based variable selection can help to build more explainable models.",2019,ArXiv
A genetic association study detects haplotypes associated with obstructive heart defects,"The development of congenital heart defects (CHDs) involves a complex interplay between genetic variants, epigenetic variants, and environmental exposures. Previous studies have suggested that susceptibility to CHDs is associated with maternal genotypes, fetal genotypes, and maternalâ€“fetal genotype (MFG) interactions. We conducted a haplotype-based genetic association study of obstructive heart defects (OHDs), aiming to detect the genetic effects of 877 SNPs involved in the homocysteine, folate, and transsulfuration pathways. Genotypes were available for 285 mother-offspring pairs with OHD-affected pregnancies and 868 mother-offspring pairs with unaffected pregnancies. A penalized logistic regression model was applied with an adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), which dissects the maternal effect, fetal effect, and MFG interaction effects associated with OHDs. By examining the association between 140 haplotype blocks, we identified 9 blocks that are potentially associated with OHD occurrence. Four haplotype blocks, located in genes MGMT, MTHFS, CBS, and DNMT3L, were statistically significant using a Bayesian false-discovery probability threshold of 0.8. Two blocks in MGMT and MTHFS appear to have significant fetal effects, while the CBS and DNMT3L genes may have significant MFG interaction effects.",2014,Human Genetics
"Combining eye tracking, pupil dilation and EEG analysis for predicting web users click intention","Merging data originated in Pupil dilation and EEG and web user behaviour.Exploring the behaviour of web users from a physiological perspective.Combining web log and physiological originated data for analysing the web user behavior. In this paper a novel approach for analyzing web user behavior and preferences on a web site is introduced, consisting of a physiological-based analysis for the assessment of a web users click intention, by merging pupil dilation and electroencephalogram (EEG) responses.First, we conducted an empirical study using five real web sites from which the gaze position, pupil dilation and EEG of 21 human subjects were recorded while performing diverse information foraging tasks. We found the existence of a statistical differentiation between choice and not-choice pupil dilation curves, specifically that fixations corresponding to clicks had greater pupil size than fixations without a click.Then 7 classification models were proposed using 15 out of 789 pupil dilation and EEG features obtained from a Random Lasso feature selection process. Although good results were obtained for Accuracy (71,09% using Logistic Regression), the results for Precision, Recall and F-Measure remained low, which indicates that the behaviour we were studying was not well classified.The above results show that it is possible to create a classifier for web user click intention behaviour based on merging features extracted from pupil dilation and EEG responses. However we conclude that it is necessary to use better quality instruments for capturing the data.",2017,Inf. Fusion
The Effect of Harmonics Count on SSVEP-Based BCI Results,"SSVEP is a BCI method based on visual stimuli selection. Compared to the well-known PSDA method, CCA and LASSO are feature reduction methods commonly used in SSVEP based Brain-Computer Interface systems due to their less noise impact. These methods require the creation of vectors with their harmonic frequencies. The number of harmonics used for SSVEP affects the results.

A utility approach to individualized optimal dose selection using biomarkers.,"In many settings, including oncology, increasing the dose of treatment results in both increased efficacy and toxicity. With the increasing availability of validated biomarkers and prediction models, there is the potential for individualized dosing based on patient specific factors. We consider the setting where there is an existing dataset of patients treated with heterogenous doses and including binary efficacy and toxicity outcomes and patient factors such as clinical features and biomarkers. The goal is to analyze the data to estimate an optimal dose for each (future) patient based on their clinical features and biomarkers. We propose an optimal individualized dose finding rule by maximizing utility functions for individual patients while limiting the rate of toxicity. The utility is defined as a weighted combination of efficacy and toxicity probabilities. This approach maximizes overall efficacy at a prespecified constraint on overall toxicity. We model the binary efficacy and toxicity outcomes using logistic regression with dose, biomarkers and dose-biomarker interactions. To incorporate the large number of potential parameters, we use the LASSO method. We additionally constrain the dose effect to be non-negative for both efficacy and toxicity for all patients. Simulation studies show that the utility approach combined with any of the modeling methods can improve efficacy without increasing toxicity relative to fixed dosing. The proposed methods are illustrated using a dataset of patients with lung cancer treated with radiationÂ therapy.",2019,Biometrical journal. Biometrische Zeitschrift
Indian Ocean Studies and the â€˜new thalassologyâ€™,"This article explores the past, present, and possible future directions of the â€˜â€˜new thalassologyâ€™â€™ [from the ancient Greek thalassa, â€˜â€˜seaâ€™â€™] and Indian Ocean studies from its humble beginnings in the 1950s and 1960s, and the cross-fertilization between the â€˜Annalesâ€™ school and world-systems analysis in the 1980s, to its â€“ admittedly incomplete â€“ institutionalization in the early twenty-first century.

Systemic risk network of Chinese financial institutions,"Abstract The Chinese stock market crash in June 2015 has demonstrated necessary to improve understanding of systemic risk from the perspective of financial network. This study constructs a tail risk network to present overall systemic risk of Chinese financial institutions, given the macroeconomic and market externalities. Employing the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method of high-dimensional models, our results show that firm's idiosyncratic risk can be affected by its connectedness with other institutions. The risk spillover effect from other companies is the main driving factor of firm-specific risk, comparing with macroeconomic state, firm characteristics and historical price movement. The number of connections between institutions significantly increases during June 2014 to June 2016. Moreover, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to test significance of systemic risk beta based on tail risk and further rank the systemic risk contribution. Finally, we test the determinants of systemic risk contribution in a forward-looking way.

Regularized Logistic Regression Fusion for Speaker Verification,"Fusion of the base classifiers is seen as the way to achieve stateof-the art performance in the speaker verfication systems. Standard approach is to pose the fusion problem as the linear binary classification task. Most successful loss function in speaker verification fusion has been the weighted logistic regression popularized by the FoCal toolkit. However, it is known that optimizing logistic regression can overfit severely without appropriate regularization. In addition, subset classifier selection can be achieved by using an external 0/1 loss function on the best subset. In this work, we propose to use LASSO based regularization on the FoCal cost function to achive improved performance and classifier subset selection method integrated into one optimization task. Proposed method is able to achieve 51% relative improvement in Actual DCF over the FoCal baseline.

Promising key genes associated with tumor microenvironments and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma,"BACKGROUND
Despite significant advances in multimodality treatments, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most common malignant tumors. Identification of novel prognostic biomarkers and molecular targets is urgently needed.


AIM
To identify potential key genes associated with tumor microenvironments and the prognosis of HCC.


METHODS
The infiltration levels of immune cells and stromal cells were calculated and quantified based on the ESTIMATE algorithm. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high and low groups according to immune or stromal scores were screened using the gene expression profile of HCC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas and were further linked to the prognosis of HCC. These genes were validated in four independent HCC cohorts. Survival-related key genes were identified by a LASSO Cox regression model.


RESULTS
HCC patients with a high immune/stromal score had better survival benefits than patients with a low score. A total of 899 DEGs were identified and found to be involved in immune responses and extracellular matrices, 147 of which were associated with overall survival. Subsequently, 52 of 147 survival-related DEGs were validated in additional cohorts. Finally, ten key genes (STSL2, TMC5, DOK5, RASGRP2, NLRC3, KLRB1, CD5L, CFHR3, ADH1C, and UGT2B15) were selected and used to construct a prognostic gene signature, which presented a good performance in predicting overall survival.


CONCLUSION
This study extracted a list of genes associated with tumor microenvironments and the prognosis of HCC, thereby providing several valuable directions for the prognostic prediction and molecular targeted therapy of HCC in the future.",2020,World Journal of Gastroenterology

Causal Inference Using Boosting in IV Regression Models,"Author(s): Xu, Hao | Advisor(s): Lee, Tae-Hwy | Abstract: This dissertation focuses on using the machine learning technique, boosting, for causal inference in the instrumental variable (IV) regression models.In Chapter 1, when endogenous variables are approximated by sieve functions of observable instruments, the number of instruments increases rapidly and many may be invalid or irrelevant. We introduce Double Boosting (DB) which consistently selects only valid and relevant instruments even when there are more instruments than the sample size. We estimate the parameter of interest using generalized method of moments (GMM) with selected instruments. We refer this method as Double Boosting GMM (DB-GMM). We show that DB does not select weakly relevant or weakly valid instruments. In Monte Carlo, we compare DB-GMM with other methods such as GMM using Lasso penalty (penalized GMM). In the application of estimating the BLP-type automobile demand function, where price is endogenous and instruments are high dimensional functions of product characteristics, we find the DB-GMM estimator of the price elasticity of demand is more elastic than other estimators.Extending from Chapter 1, Chapter 2 combines the DB selection algorithm from Chapter 1 with the multiple-layer neural networks (NN) for the first-stage IV estimation, where high dimensional sieve instrument variables are the activation functions at the last hidden layer of the neural networks.Chapter 3 studies the panel data models with many instruments. When the regressors are endogenous in the panel data models, we employed the 2SLS approach for the FE estimator. We denote it as FE-2SLS. We find that the FE-2SLS estimator is sensitive to the number of instruments, where it is inconsistent when the number of instruments increases. We show that using the two regularization methods, SCAD and L2Boosting, for instrument selection make the FE-2SLS estimator more robust and restore its consistency when there are many instruments. Furthermore, we consider a Stein-like combined estimator of the FE and FE-2SLS estimators and provide its asymptotic properties.

"Molecular and Phenetic Characterization of the Bacterial Assemblage of Hot Lake, WA, an Environment with High Concentrations of Magnesium Sulfate, and Its Relevance to Mars.","Hot Lake (Oroville, WA) is an athalassohaline epsomite lake that can have precipitating concentrations of MgSO4 salts, mainly epsomite. Little biotic study has been done on epsomite lakes and it was unclear whether microbes isolated from epsomite lakes and their margins would fall within recognized halotolerant genera, common soil genera, or novel phyla. Our initial study cultivated and characterized epsotolerant bacteria from the lake and its margins. Approximately 100 aerobic heterotrophic microbial isolates were obtained by repetitive streak-plating in high-salt media including either 10% NaCl or 2 M MgSO4. The collected isolates were all bacteria, nearly evenly divided between Gram-positive and Gram-negative clades, the most abundant genera being Halomonas, Idiomarina, Marinobacter, Marinococcus, Nesterenkonia, Nocardiopsis, and Planococcus. Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Exiguobacterium, Kocuria, and Staphylococcus also were cultured. This initial study included culture-independent community analysis of direct DNA extracts of lake margin soil using PCR-based clone libraries and 16S rRNA gene phylogeny. Clones assigned Gram-positive bacterial clades (70% of total clones) were dominated by sequences related to uncultured actinobacteria. There were abundant Deltaproteobacteria clones related to bacterial sulfur metabolisms and clones of Legionella and Coxiella. These epsomite lake microbial communities seem to be divided between bacteria primarily associated with hyperhaline environments rich in NaCl and salinotolerant relatives of common soil organisms. Archaea appear to be in low abundance and none were isolated, despite near-saturated salinities. Growth of microbes at very high concentrations of magnesium and other sulfates has relevance to planetary protection and life-detection missions to Mars, where scant liquid water may form as deliquescent brines and appear as eutectic liquids.",2014,International journal of astrobiology
Analyses des paramÃ¨tres dÃ©mographiques et zootechniques du cheptel bovin des Ã©levages pÃ©ri-urbains laitiers de la ville de Bobo-Dioulasso Ã  lâ€™Ouest du Burkina Faso,"Les statistiques sur les parametres demographiques et zootechniques du cheptel bovin est essentielles pour l'elaboration des strategies de developpement appropriees et l'intensification durable de la production laitiere en Afrique de lâ€™Ouest. Câ€™est dans cette optique que la presente etude est menee. Lâ€™objectif de lâ€™etude est de determiner les parametres demographiques et zootechniques du cheptel bovin de la zone peri-urbaine de Bobo-Dioulasso, a lâ€™Ouest du Burkina Faso. La methode dâ€™enquete retrospective des douze derniers mois (12mo) a ete utilisee. Il a concerne au total 64 troupeaux laitiers installes a la peripherie de la ville dans quatre campements riverains. Les resultats obtenus indiquent que la taille moyenne des troupeaux est de 46 tetes dont 70% de femelles. Les races Zebus peulh soudanien et les metis Mere sont les races dominantes avec respectivement 80% et 15%. Les autres races notamment le Zebu Goudali, le Zebu Mâ€™Bororo, Zebu Azawak, le Gir et leurs metis ne representent que 5% du cheptel enquete. Le taux de mise bas pour les 12 mois qui ont precedes lâ€™enquete varie entre 46,77% et 56,35% pour lâ€™ensemble des troupeaux. Le taux de mortalite global est en moyenne de 6,85% ; il est relativement plus eleve chez les veaux (24,82%). Le taux dâ€™exploitation global est de 13,20% dont 22,70% pour les mÃ¢les et de 9,71% pour les femelles. Les performances des troupeaux enquetes sont caracteristiques des troupeaux laitiers extensifs en voix dâ€™intensification.Â  Mots cles : Enquete 12mo, parametres zootechniques, elevage peri-urbain, zone subhumide, Burkina Faso. English Title : Analyses of demographic and zootechnic parameters of peri-urban dairy herd of Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso Information on the demographic and zootechnic parameters of cattle herds is key for designing appropriate development and sustainableÂ  intensification of dairy sector in West Africa. For this purpose, we conducted this study which aim is to assess the demographic and zootechnicÂ  parameters of the peri-urban dairy cattle herds in Bobo Dioulasso in western Burkina Faso. The 12 monthsâ€™ retrospectives herd survey method (12mo) was used. It covered in total, sixty-four (64) dairy herds in the peri-urban area of the city from four livestock keepersâ€™ camps. Results indicated that average herd size is 46 heads of cattle with 70% of females dairyÂ  cows. Zebu peulh Soudanien (also called Fulani Sudanese Zebu) and itÂ  crossed breeds with taurin breeds (called Mere) were the dominants breeds kept, representing about 80% et 15% of the total herd, respectively. Other breeds such as Zebu Goudali, Zebu Mâ€™Bororo, Zebu Azawak, Gir and their crossed breeds cows represent only 5% of the herds monitored. Birth rate of the 12 months preceding the survey varies from 46.77% to 56.35%. Average global mortality rate was estimated about 6.85% but mortality rate for youth animals was higher (24.82%). Global off take rate is estimated about 13.20% with higher rate for male (22.70%) as compared to females (9.71%). Our findings show that the peri-urban herds monitored are in extensive dairy production systems towards intensification.Â  Keywords : 12mo Survey, demographic and zootechnic parameters, peri-urban livestock, sub humid zone, Burkina Faso.",2019,International Journal of Biological and Chemical Sciences
Variable Selection with False Discovery Control,"Technological advances that allow routine identification of high-dimensional risk factors have led to high demand for statistical techniques that enable full utilization of these rich sources of information for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Variable selection for censored outcome data as well as control of false discoveries (i.e. inclusion of irrelevant variables) in the presence of highdimensional predictors present serious challenges. In the context of survival analysis with high-dimensional covariates, this paper develops a computationally feasible method for building general risk prediction models, while controlling false discoveries. We have proposed a high-dimensional variable selection method by incorporating stability selection to control false discovery. Comparisons between the proposed method and the commonly used univariate and Lasso approaches for variable selection reveal that the proposed method yields fewer false discoveries. The proposed method is applied to study the associations of 2,339 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with overall survival among cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients. The results have confirmed that BRCA2 pathway SNPs are likely to be associated with overall survival, as reported by previous literature. Moreover, we have identified several new Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway SNPs that are likely to modulate survival of CM patients.
