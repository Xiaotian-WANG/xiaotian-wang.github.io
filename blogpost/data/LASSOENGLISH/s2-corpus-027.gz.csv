Buckley-James Boosting for Survival Analysis with High-Dimensional Biomarker Data,"There has been increasing interest in predicting patients' survival after therapy by investigating gene expression microarray data. In the regression and classification models with high-dimensional genomic data, boosting has been successfully applied to build accurate predictive models and conduct variable selection simultaneously. We propose the Buckley-James boosting for the semiparametric accelerated failure time models with right censored survival data, which can be used to predict survival of future patients using the high-dimensional genomic data. In the spirit of adaptive LASSO, twin boosting is also incorporated to fit more sparse models. The proposed methods have a unified approach to fit linear models, non-linear effects models with possible interactions. The methods can perform variable selection and parameter estimation simultaneously. The proposed methods are evaluated by simulations and applied to a recent microarray gene expression data set for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma under the current gold standard therapy.",2010,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology
"Bearing capacity determination by limit analysis, January 1972(FL 73-35)","The upper bound technique of limit analysis is used to develop approximate solutions for the bearing capacity of cohesive soils with weight. Solutions are presented for smooth and rough and surface and subsurface footings. Soil is treated as a perfectly plastic medium with the associated flow rule after Drucker. The limit analysis solutions for smooth, surface footings are shown to compare favorably with slip-line solutions. Meyerhof's solutions and the limit analysis solutions for rough, subsurface footings are shown to agree remarkably well. lAssociate Professor of Civil Engineering, Fritz Laboratory, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa. 2Teaching Assistant, Department of Civil Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa.",1972,
Accuracy of genomic selection for alfalfa biomass yield in different reference populations,"BackgroundGenomic selection based on genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data could accelerate alfalfa yield gains, if it displayed moderate ability to predict parent breeding values. Its interest would be enhanced by predicting ability also for germplasm/reference populations other than those for which it was defined. Predicting accuracy may be influenced by statistical models, SNP calling procedures and missing data imputation strategies.ResultsLandrace and variety material from two genetically-contrasting reference populations, i.e., 124 elite genotypes adapted to the Po Valley (sub-continental climate; PV population) and 154 genotypes adapted to Mediterranean-climate environments (Me population), were genotyped by GBS and phenotyped in separate environments for dry matter yield of their dense-planted half-sib progenies. Both populations showed no sub-population genetic structure. Predictive accuracy was higher by joint rather than separate SNP calling for the two data sets, and using random forest imputation of missing data. Highest accuracy was obtained using Support Vector Regression (SVR) for PV, and Ridge Regression BLUP and SVR for Me germplasm. Bayesian methods (Bayes A, Bayes B and Bayesian Lasso) tended to be less accurate. Random Forest Regression was the least accurate model. Accuracy attained about 0.35 for Me in the range of 0.30-0.50 missing data, and 0.32 for PV at 0.50 missing data, using at least 10,000 SNP markers. Cross-population predictions based on a smaller subset of common SNPs implied a relative loss of accuracy of about 25Â % for Me and 30Â % for PV. Genome-wide association analyses based on large subsets of M. truncatula-aligned markers revealed many SNPs with modest association with yield, and some genome areas hosting putative QTLs. A comparison of genomic vs. conventional selection for parent breeding value assuming 1-year vs. 5-year selection cycles, respectively, indicated over three-fold greater predicted yield gain per unit time for genomic selection.ConclusionsGenomic selection for alfalfa yield is promising, based on its moderate prediction accuracy, moderate value of cross-population predictions, and lack of sub-population structure. There is limited scope for searching individual QTLs with overwhelming effect on yield. Some of our results can contribute to better design of genomic selection experiments for alfalfa and other crops with similar mating systems.",2015,BMC Genomics
"Zancolli's ""lasso"" operation in intrinsic palsy of leprous origin. A study of twenty-six cases.","Twenty-six cases of Zancolli's ""lasso"" procedure are presented. They were part of a series of 122 operations performed for leprosy in Central Africa. Nineteen cases with a follow-up of more than 6 months were reviewed. Fifteen of these patients had good or very good results. When claw hand deformities are supple, one flexor superficialis tendon may be used for two fingers; when the fingers are partially stiff, one tendon for each finger should be used. The ""lasso"" procedure is simple and the results are satisfactory, particularly in this series of patients who did not follow any rehabilitation program.",1985,Annales de chirurgie de la main : organe officiel des societes de chirurgie de la main
Abstract 1401: A systems immunology analysis to detect prognostic biomarkers in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck,"In 2015, an estimated 59,340 people will develop head and neck cancer and an estimated 12,290 deaths will occur. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the immune system plays a key role in the development, establishment, and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here, we conduct comprehensive immune profiling to better understand the immunophenotype of HNSCC patients, assess the applicability of immune-modulatory drugs, and identify prognostic biomarkers of response to cetuximab treatment. Our systems immunology approach is composed of three complimentary, high-dimensional technologies: time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF), luminex, and the HIMChip microarray platform. Mass cytometry quantifies protein expression on a single-cell basis by utilizing transition element, isotope-tagged antibodies. The Luminex immunoassay measures plasma cytokine levels. The â€œHIMChipâ€ microarray is a custom Agilent SurePrint HD 8Ã—15k format array containing over 7,000 unique probes for over 4,274 human immune-related genes. We employed these technologies to study the global immune status of thirty HNSCC patients receiving treatment with cetuximab, an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Patients were consented to participate on the Phase 0 biomarker-focused clinical trial (NCT01114256) and peripheral blood was obtained before and after cetuximab treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma were isolated from each time point and utilized in downstream analysis. Via manual gating, our CyTOF-based phenotyping measured 24 distinct populations and the expression of 5 activation markers and 5 checkpoint receptors. The results of manual gating were confirmed with an automated, unsupervised algorithmic analysis combining stochastic neighbor embedding and k-means clustering. The resulting 2D representation of our single-cell data preserved global geometries and facilitated exploration of unique subsets within the natural killer (NK) compartment. To assess the prognostic value of these NK cell subsets, we applied a lasso-regularized logistic regression model to stratify patients based on their clinical response to cetuximab therapy. We identified an NK cell subset that is associated with clinical benefit to therapy. Luminex analysis revealed a cetuximab-induced cytokine signature composed of VCAM1, IP-10, and VEGFD that may play a role in increasing NK cell trafficking to tumor (T-statistics of 1.77, 2.17, and 1.55 respectively). The HIMChip microarray results support our proteomic findings. These results provide the first known comprehensive immune profiling of HNSCC patients as they undergo treatment with cetuximab. Validation in a large cohort of patients is needed and future mechanistic studies will investigate the efficacy of our novel NK cell population in disease control.

Accuracy of Genomic Prediction under Different Genetic Architectures and Estimation Methods,"The accuracy of genomic breeding value prediction was investigated in various levels of reference population size, trait heritability and the number of quantitative trait locus (QTL). Five Bayesian methods, including Bayesian Ridge regression, BayesA, BayesB, BayesC and Bayesian LASSO, were used to estimate the marker effects for each of 27 scenarios resulted from combining three levels for heritability (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5), training population size (600, 1000 and 1600) and QTL numbers (50, 100 and 150). A finite locus model was used to simulate stochastically a historical population consisting 100 animals at first 100 generations. Through next 100 generations, the population size gradually increased to 1000 individuals. Then the animals in generations 201 and 202 having both known genotypic and phenotypic records were assigned as reference population, and individuals at generations 203 and 204 were considered as validation population. The genome comprised five chromosomes of 100 cM length and 500 single nucleotide polymorphism markers for each chromosome that distributed through the genome randomly. The QTLs and markers were bi-allelic. In this study, the heritability had great significant positive effect on the accuracy (P<0.001). By increasing the size of the reference population, the average genomic accuracy increased from 0.64Â±0.03 to 0.70 Â± 0.04 (P<0.001). The accuracy responded to increasing number of QTLs non-linearly. The highest and lowest accuracies of Bayesian methods were 0.40 Â± 0.04 and 0.84 Â± 0.05, respectively. The results showed having the greatest amount of information (i.e. highest heritability, highest contribution of gene action in phenotypic variation and large reference population size), the highest accuracy (0.84) was obtained, with all investigated methods of estimation.",2018,Iranian Journal of Applied Animal Science
"How Much Is My House Worth ? Predicting Housing Prices in McKinney , Texas","The goal was to give homeowners a prediction on their houseâ€™s closing price which would be put on the market. Classification and regression methods were used as well as natural language processing on each houseâ€™s remarks. The best set of models found used Lasso L1 regularization. Prediction performed remarkably better than classification, and predicted close prices with 95% confidence with this interval: $54, 400 to $51, 800 The goal of this project is to create a model that can best predict the closing price for a house before it has been placed on the market. This is important as it can help homeowners not only estimate a listing price but serve as a second opinion if need be. The project is based on data from the company Opendoor, which uses machine learning to predict housing prices and make selling your home easier. Our dataset is from home sales in the small town of McKenney Texas from late 2014 to mid 2015. Although it has only about 1100 observations, it provides many different features for the data such as area of the house, types of floors, number of bedrooms, etc. Dataset and Features Cleaning the data set included eliminating features that were relevant only once the house had been sold since we were only interested in predicting the price that a house should be given when entered into the market. We then converted categorical features such as the type of flooring of the house into binary ones. We also created new features such as binary features for the season in which the house was listed on the market and the age of the house. These modifications to our dataset largely increased the number of features in our training set so that at the end we had 83 features. Once we had cleaned our data set we looked at the shape of the distribution of the target feature, the closing price of the house, to understand how to best fit the data. The closing price seemed to follow a normal distribution skewed left, and the log norCopyright c 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

"Rare events of cyclopia and melanism among deep-water snailfishes (Liparidae, Scorpaeniformes)","Natural anomalies of fish eyes are noted occasionally and were never previously reported for snailfishes (Liparidae). Among fishes melanism is occurred in the nature relatively rare and sometimes associated with intergeneric hybridization or pathologic invasion. Until now the cases of melanism among fishes were known only for some paddlefishes (Polyodontidae), gars (Lepidosteidae), herrings (Clupeidae), livebearers (Poeciliidae), carps (Cyprinidae), loaches (Cobitiidae), salmons (Salmonidae), cods (Gadidae), rockfishes (Scorpaenidae), and righteye flounders (Pleuronectidae). Melanistic specimens of snailfishes were never previously reported. The first records of single-eyed specimen of round snailfish, Careproctus roseofuscus, and melanistic specimens of dimdisc snailfish, Elassodiscus tremebundus, and undescribed species, Careproctus cf. cyclocephalus, are documented.

Structured Learning of Gaussian Graphical Models,"We consider estimation of multiple high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models corresponding to a single set of nodes under several distinct conditions. We assume that most aspects of the networks are shared, but that there are some structured differences between them. Specifically, the network differences are generated from node perturbations: a few nodes are perturbed across networks, and most or all edges stemming from such nodes differ between networks. This corresponds to a simple model for the mechanism underlying many cancers, in which the gene regulatory network is disrupted due to the aberrant activity of a few specific genes. We propose to solve this problem using the perturbed-node joint graphical lasso, a convex optimization problem that is based upon the use of a row-column overlap norm penalty. We then solve the convex problem using an alternating directions method of multipliers algorithm. Our proposal is illustrated on synthetic data and on an application to brain cancer gene expression data.",2012,Advances in neural information processing systems
Inferring Students' Sense of Community from Their Communication Behavior in Online Courses,"Sense of community is regarded as the reflection of students' feelings of connectedness with community members and commonality of learning expectations and goals. In online courses, sense of community has been proven to influence students' learning engagement and academic performance. Low sense of community is also one of the reasons for drop out. However, existing studies mainly acquire students' sense of community via questionnaires, which demand user efforts and have difficulty in obtaining real-time feeling during students' learning process. In addition, although communication is helpful to enhance students' sense of community, little work has empirically compared the impact of different online communication tools. In this paper, we are motivated to derive students' sense of community from their communication behavior in online courses. Concretely, we first identify a set of features that are significantly correlated with students' sense of community, which not only include their activities carried out in both synchronous and asynchronous online learning environment, but also their linguistic content in conversational texts. We then develop inference model to unify these features for determining students' sense of community, and find that LASSO performs the best in terms of inference accuracy.",2017,"Proceedings of the 25th Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization"
Development of an individualized risk calculator for poor functioning in young people victimized during childhood: A longitudinal cohort study,"BACKGROUND
Childhood victimization elevates the average risk of developing functional impairment in adulthood. However, not all victimized children demonstrate poor outcomes. Although research has described factors that confer vulnerability or resilience, it is unknown if this knowledge can be translated to accurately identify the most vulnerable victimized children.


OBJECTIVE
To build and internally validate a risk calculator to identify those victimized children who are most at risk of functional impairment at age 18 years.


PARTICIPANTS
We utilized data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally-representative birth cohort of 2232 UK children born in 1994-95.


METHODS
Victimization exposure was assessed repeatedly between ages 5 and 12 years along with a range of individual-, family- and community-level predictors. Functional outcomes were assessed at age 18 years. We developed and evaluated a prediction model for psychosocial disadvantage and economic disadvantage using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularized regression with nested 10-fold cross-validation.


RESULTS
The model predicting psychosocial disadvantage following childhood victimization retained 12 of 22 predictors, had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.65, and was well-calibrated within the range of 40-70% predicted risk. The model predicting economic disadvantage retained 10 of 22 predictors, achieved excellent discrimination (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.80), and a high degree of calibration.


CONCLUSIONS
Prediction modelling techniques can be applied to estimate individual risk for poor functional outcomes in young adulthood following childhood victimization. Such risk prediction tools could potentially assist practitioners to target interventions, which is particularly useful in a context of scarce resources.",2019,Child Abuse & Neglect
Comparative Presentation of Machine Learning Algorithms in Flood Prediction Using Spatio-Temporal Data,"The development of accurate flood prediction model could reduce number of fatalities by assisting local government in decision making. In this paper, three well-known machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Lasso, are compared in terms of flood prediction accuracy. The selected algorithms are applied to learn flood prediction models for six U.S. Geological Survey gauges in North Texas. Three data sets from different sources had been used to learn flood prediction models. The data sets include Water level time series from gauges, spatio-temporal precipitation from National Weather Serviceâ€™s Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler, and hydrological data from Hydrology Laboratory-Distributed Hydrologic Model. Although Support Vector Machine usually performs well in many applications, the results suggest that Lasso is the most appropriate for flood prediction while Support Vector Machine performs the worst.",2016,
Robust Variable Selection Methods for Grouped Data,"When predictor variables possess an underlying grouping structure in multiple regression, selecting important groups of variables is an essential component of building a meaningful regression model. Some methods exist to perform group selection, but do not perform well when the data include outliers. Four methods for robust variable selection of grouped data, based on the group LASSO, are presented: two regular methods and two adaptive methods. For each of the two methods in the regular and adaptive groups, one method works well for data with outliers in the y-direction, and the other method works well for data with outliers in both the xand ydirections. The effectiveness of each of these methods is illustrated with an extensive simulation study and a real data example.",2015,
"Knowledge, Attitude and Practice of Pesticides use and Waste Disposal among Vegetable and Cotton Farmers in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","The knowledge, attitude and practice of pesticides use and waste disposal among vegetable and cotton farmersin BoboDioulasso, Burkina Faso were surveyed using a structured questionnaire. Results showed that 32.1% to 60.3% of the farmers had poor educational background, while none had completed tertiary education (indicative of poor knowledge). Majority of farmers (69.4% to 99.3%) re-sprayed the treated fields until the spray tank was empty (indicative of poor practice). Some farmers either buried (35.9% to 64.3%) or burnt (30.7%) the empty pesticide containers in the field. Majority (74.6% to 95.1%) of the farmers consumed the contaminated water around the field or used it for other domestic purposes (indicative of poor attitude). Results obtained from this survey compels the need to take farmersâ€™ education as priority. Further, there is a need to encourage research into the development of simple environmentally-friendly methods, such as biobeds, to degrade pesticide residues in rinsate.",2019,
Cortico-cortical and cortico-muscular connectivity analysis : methods and application to Parkinson's disease,"The concept of brain connectivity provides a new perspective to the understanding of the mechanism underlying brain functions, complementing the traditional approach of analyzing neural activity of isolated regions. Among the existing connectivity analysis techniques, multivariate autoregressive (mAR)-based measures are of great interest for their ability to characterize both directionality and spectral property of cortical interactions. Yet, the direct estimation of mAR-based connectivity from scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) is confounded by volume conduction, statistical instability and inter-subject variability. In this thesis, we propose novel signal processing methods to enhance the existing mAR-based connectivity methods. First, we explore incorporating sparsity constraints into the mAR formulation at both subject level and group level using LASSO-based regression. We show by simulation that sparse mAR yields more stable and accurate connectivity estimates compared to the traditional, non-sparse approach. Furthermore, the group-wise sparsity simplifies the inference of group-level connectivity patterns from multi-subject data. To mitigate the effect of volume conduction, we investigate source-level connectivity and propose a state-space generalized mAR framework to jointly model the mixing effect of volume conduction and causal relationships between underlying neural sources. By jointly estimating the mixing process and mAR model parameters, the proposed technique demonstrates improved connectivity estimation performance. Finally, we expanded our connectivity analysis to cortico-muscular level by modeling the relationships between EEG and simultaneously recorded electromyography (EMG) data using a multiblock partial least square (mbPLS) framework. The hierarchical construction of the mbPLS framework provides a natural way to model multi-subject, multi-",2012,
A comparative study on the classification of engineering surfaces with dimension reduction and coefficient shrinkage methods,"As more automated and accurate surface inspection devices enter the manufacturing process, engineers collect a larger amount of surface inspection data, in terms of storage space and the number of parameters to characterize the surface, but sometimes smaller in terms of the number of coherent surface observations. In these cases, more features are preferable to characterize engineering surfaces for capturing the details of the surface finish patterns. When the number of surface parameters exceeds the number of collected surface observations, a difficulty with the dimensionality emerges in classification. This paper has researched the accuracy and interpretability of using the dimension reduction and coefficient shrinkage methods in combination with the logistic model to deal with this dimensionality problem in engineering surface classification. Five methods for dimension reduction and coefficient shrinkage are selected and compared. These are: subset selection (Sub), principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), ridge regression (Ridge), and least absolute and shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). A case study is used to illustrate their effectiveness by classifying 30 pump body surfaces with 40 surface feature parameters. The obtained results show that the dimension reduction methods, PCA and PLS, could achieve higher classification accuracies but their results are not interpretable. Sub could achieve higher accuracy in this case, but the discrete parameter selection process is aggressive. Finally, the classification results of the coefficient shrinkage methods, Ridge and Lasso, are interpretable for process faults diagnosis purposes; however, the accuracies are lower than the other methods.",2006,Journal of Manufacturing Systems

Chemical characterisation of glass mosaic tesserae from sixth-century Sagalassos (south-west Turkey): chronology and production techniques,"Little is known about the origin, supply pattern and production technology of Byzantine glass mosaic tesserae. In this study, we have analysed forty-eight glass tesserae from Sagalassos (Asia Minor) of different colours and from two archaeological contexts that were stratigraphically dated to the sixth century CE. The main aim was to identify the raw materials, colourants and opacifiers as well as secondary working practices that are reflected in the composition (EPMA, LA-ICP-MS analyses) and the microstructure (XRD, SEM-BSE) of the tesserae. The set of samples retrieved from the Roman Baths complex at Sagalassos is compositionally very homogeneous, representing possibly a single commission, and can be tentatively dated to the late Roman period. In contrast, the assemblage associated with the construction of a Byzantine church around the turn of the sixth century CE is more diverse, suggesting 
that these tesserae were produced from more than one silica source. This highlights a diversification in the supply and manufacture of glass tesserae during the Byzantine period. 
Although all analysed samples are natron-type soda-lime-silica glasses, a strong correlation between MgO, K2O, P2O5 and CaO was observed, pointing to the contamination of the glass batch through fuel ash either intentionally in case of the red tesserae or accidentally as regards the green, peacock and white samples. The degree of contamination reflects differences in the duration of the secondary production stage according to the colour, which is also evidenced by the shapes and sizes of the opacifying crystals 
present in the opaque tesserae. X-ray diffraction measurements identified calcium antimonate (in the blue, peacock and white tesserae) and lead antimonate (green and yellow) as the main opacifying agents. The morphological analysis suggests that the calcium antimonate particles crystallised in situ, whereas a lead antimonate pigment was synthesised prior to its addition to the glass melt. Taken together, the compositional and microstructural characteristics clearly demonstrate different production processes that are related to the colours of the tesserae, thus indicating colour-specific secondary workshop practices",2012,Journal of Archaeological Science
A risk score model for the prediction of osteosarcoma metastasis,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary solid malignancy of the bone, and its high mortality usually correlates with early metastasis. In this study, we developed a risk score model to help predict metastasis at the time of diagnosis. We downloaded and mined four expression profile datasets associated with osteosarcoma metastasis from the Gene Expression Omnibus. After data normalization, we performed LASSO logistic regression analysis together with 10-fold cross validation using the GSE21257 dataset. A combination of eight genes (RAB1,CLEC3B,FCGBP,RNASE3,MDL1,ALOX5AP,VMO1 and ALPK3) were identified as being associated with osteosarcoma metastasis. These genes were put into a gene risk score model, and the prediction efficiency of the model was then validated using three independent datasets (GSE33383, GSE66673, and GSE49003) by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves. The expression levels of the eight genes in all datasets were shown as heatmaps, and gene ontology gene annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were performed. These eight genes play a role in cancer-related biological processes, such as apoptosis and biosynthetic processes. Our results may aid in elucidating the possible mechanisms of osteosarcoma metastasis, and may help to facilitate the individual management of patients with osteosarcoma after treatment.",2019,FEBS Open Bio
Bayesian regularized quantile structural equation models,"Latent variables that should be examined using multiple observed variables are common in substantive research. The structural equation model (SEM) is widely recognized as the most important statistical tool for assessing interrelationships among latent variables. As a recent advancement, Bayesian quantile SEM provides a comprehensive assessment of the conditional quantile of the response latent variables given the explanatory covariates and latent variables. In this study, we develop Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and Bayesian adaptive Lasso procedures to conduct simultaneous estimation and variable selection in the context of quantile SEM. We propose the use of the Markov chain Monte Carlo method to conduct Bayesian inference. Various features, including the finite sample performance of the proposed procedures, are validated through simulation studies. The proposed method is applied to investigate the determinants of the capital structure of Chinese-listed companies.",2017,J. Multivar. Anal.
Ensemble Feature Selection for Plant Phenotyping: A Journey From Hyperspectral to Multispectral Imaging,"Hyperspectral imaging is becoming an increasingly popular tool for high-throughput plant phenotyping, because it provides remarkable insights about the health status of plants. Feature selection is a key component in a hyperspectral image analysis, largely because a significant portion of spectral features are redundant and/or irrelevant, depending on the desired application. This paper presents an ensemble feature selection method to identify the most informative spectral features for practical applications in plant phenotyping. The hyperspectral data set contained the images of four wheat lines, each with a control and a salt (NaCl) treatment. To rank spectral features, six feature selection methods were used as the base for the ensemble: correlation-based feature selection, ReliefF, sequential feature selection, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), LASSO logistic regression, and random forest. The best results were achieved by the ensemble of ReliefF, SVM-RFE, and random forest, which drastically reduced the dimension of the hyperspectral data set from 215 to 15 features, while improving the accuracy in classifying the salt-treated vegetation pixels from the control pixels by 8.5%. To transform the hyperspectral data set into a multispectral data set, six wavelengths as the center of broad multispectral bands around the most prominent features were determined by a clustering algorithm. The result of salt tolerance assessment of the four wheat lines using the derived multispectral data set was similar to that of the hyperspectral data set. This demonstrates that the proposed feature selection pipeline can be utilized for determining the most informative features and can be a valuable tool in the development of tailored multispectral cameras.",2018,IEEE Access
1485: Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for In-hospital Cardiac Arrest in the Elderly Retrospective Analysis,"Learning Objectives: Clinicians rely on their knowledge of prognosis to support patient decision-making regarding whether to enact Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAPCR) orders. The Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) Score is a well-validated tool that predicts survival after In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (IHCA) with no cerebral dysfunction (CPC â‰¤ 1). However, patients may consider survival with moderate cerebral dysfunction acceptable (CPC â‰¤ 2). Our objective was to validate the ability of the GO-FAR score to identify patients unlikely to survive IHCA with CPC â‰¤ 2 and to develop a modified GO-FAR score to accurately predict survival after IHCA with CPC â‰¤ 2. Methods: 54,425 inpatients with IHCA from 2012 2017. First, validation of the GO-FAR Score was attempted using survival with CPC â‰¤ 2. Next, the data were divided into training (44%), test (22%), and validation (34%) sets. Univariate analysis was used to identify variables with >3% absolute difference in survival with CPC â‰¤ 2, which were carried forward to a multivariate analysis. A final logistic regression model was created using Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Candidate decision models were assessed using the test dataset to select the most parsimonious model that best classified patients as having a very poor (â‰¤5%), poor (6%10%), average (11%30%), or above average (>30%) likelihood of survival after CPR for IHCA with CPC â‰¤ 2. Results: The original GO FAR Score performed poorly for CPC â‰¤ 2. In the univariate model, age > 85, admission CPC < 2, and non-surgical admission had the largest association with outcome (-12.1%, -14.4%, and -18%, respectively). 13 variables were included in the logistic regression analysis. The final model accurately categorized 24.8% of patients with below average likelihood of CPC â‰¤ 2 in the training set, versus 21.5% and 22.4% in the testing and validation sets. Conclusions: The shared decision-making process must balance the patientâ€™s goals and values for medical treatment with an accurate estimate of a patientâ€™s chance of survival with an acceptable functional outcome. The GO-FARTHER Score extends the relevance of the GO-FAR Score to those patients with CPC â‰¤ 2.",2019,Critical Care Medicine

DropLasso: A robust variant of Lasso for single cell RNA-seq data,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a fast growing approach to measure the genome-wide transcriptome of many individual cells in parallel, but results in noisy data with many dropout events. Existing methods to learn molecular signatures from bulk transcriptomic data may therefore not be adapted to scRNA-seq data, in order to automatically classify individual cells into predefined classes. We propose a new method called DropLasso to learn a molecular signature from scRNA-seq data. DropLasso extends the dropout regularisation technique, popular in neural network training, to esti- mate sparse linear models. It is well adapted to data corrupted by dropout noise, such as scRNA-seq data, and we clarify how it relates to elastic net regularisation. We provide promising results on simulated and real scRNA-seq data, suggesting that DropLasso may be better adapted than standard regularisa- tions to infer molecular signatures from scRNA-seq data.",2018,ArXiv
RelaÃ§Ã£o entre ansiedade e dor de anestesia local e procedimentos periodontais,"O objetivo deste estudo cruzado foi avaliar 21 voluntarios, submetidos a tratamentoperiodontal, quanto ao grau de ansiedade e sensacao dolorosa, em duas sessoes: 1) anestesialocal (AL1) e raspagem periodontal (RP); 2) anestesia local (AL2) e raspagem periodontalassociada a cirurgia periodontal (CP). A ansiedade foi avaliada pela Escala de Ansiedade Dentalde Corah (EADC), aplicada antes das sessoes, e a sensibilidade dolorosa atraves da EscalaAnalogica Visual (EAV), apos o termino das sessoes. Os dados foram submetidos aos testes deWilcoxon pareado e correlacao de Spearman, com nivel de significÃ¢ncia de 5%. A maioria dosvoluntarios foi considerada olevemente ansiosao nas duas sessoes de atendimento. Nao houvediferenca significativa entre as sessoes com relacao a sensibilidade dolorosa a anestesia local e aosprocedimentos periodontais, porem, quanto a sensibilidade dolorosa, houve diferenca significativaentre anestesia local e procedimentos periodontais em cada sessao (EAV-AL1 e EAV-RP: p = 0,009;EAV-AL2 e EAV-CP: p = 0,008), sem correlacao entre grau de ansiedade e sensibilidade dolorosa,exceto para EADC2-EAV-AL2 (r = 0,47; p = 0,03). Concluiu-se que o grau de ansiedade manteveseconstante independente do procedimento e que a sensibilidade dolorosa a anestesia local foisuperior a do procedimento periodontal, sugerindo que, controlada a dor do paciente por meio daanestesia local, os procedimentos subsequentes tornam-se menos estressantes aos pacientes (AU) This crossover study evaluated the level of anxiety and painful sensibility due tolocal anesthesia and periodontal therapy of 21 volunteers submitted to periodontal treatment, intwo sessions: 1) Local anesthesia (LA1) and root scaling (RS); 2) Local anesthesia (LA2) androot scaling associated to periodontal surgery (PS). The anxiety was assessed by Corah DentalAnxiety Scale (CDAS) applied at the beginning of the sessions; pain sensibility was assessed byVisual Analogue Scale (VAS) in the end of the sessions. The data were analyzed by Spearman andWilcoxon tests (a = 0.05). The majority of the volunteers was considered as oslightly anxiousoin both sessions (p = 0.80). No statistically significant difference was observed between sessionsin relation to pain sensibility to local anesthesia and periodontal treatment, however there wasstatistically significant difference in pain sensibility between local anesthesia and periodontaltreatment in each session (VAS-LA1 and VAS-RS: p = 0.009; VAS-LA2 and VAS-PS: p = 0.008), with no correlation between anxiety and pain sensibility, except for CDAS2-VAS-LA2 (r = 0.47;p = 0.03). It can be concluded that the level of anxiety remained unchanged in the sessions withno correlation to the procedure and that pain sensibility to local anesthesia was higher than thatassociated to periodontal treatment, which suggests that, once the once the pain is controlled by localanesthesia, the treatment becomes less stressful to the patient (AU)",2006,
A Sparsity Inducing Nuclear-Norm Estimator (SpINNEr) for Matrix-Variate Regression in Brain Connectivity Analysis,"Classical scalar-response regression methods treat covariates as a vector and estimate a corresponding vector of regression coefficients. In medical applications, however, regressors are often in a form of multi-dimensional arrays. For example, one may be interested in using MRI imaging to identify which brain regions are associated with a health outcome. Vectorizing the two-dimensional image arrays is an unsatisfactory approach since it destroys the inherent spatial structure of the images and can be computationally challenging. We present an alternative approach - regularized matrix regression - where the matrix of regression coefficients is defined as a solution to the specific optimization problem. The method, called SParsity Inducing Nuclear Norm EstimatoR (SpINNEr), simultaneously imposes two penalty types on the regression coefficient matrix---the nuclear norm and the lasso norm---to encourage a low rank matrix solution that also has entry-wise sparsity. A specific implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to build a fast and efficient numerical solver. Our simulations show that SpINNEr outperforms other methods in estimation accuracy when the response-related entries (representing the brain's functional connectivity) are arranged in well-connected communities. SpINNEr is applied to investigate associations between HIV-related outcomes and functional connectivity in the human brain.",2020,ArXiv
Effects of benzo(a)pyrene on early development of flatfish,"The ontogenetic effects of the environmental carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BAP) on three species of larval flatfish were investigated using concentrations (from 0.10 to 4.2 ppb) which were comparable to levels found in polluted harbors. BAP-treated sand sole (Psettichthys melanostichus) eggs displayed a significant decline in hatching success and a significantly higher incidence of developmental anomalies than did control eggs. Flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) eggs exposed to a single dose of a water-soluble BAP-bovine serum albumin complex demonstrated evidence of toxie injury with pycnotic nuclei present in the integument and, more commonly, in ocular and neural tissues. An increased incidence of morphological anomalies in English sole (Parophyrs vetulus) eggs and larvae exposed to BAP was not detected.",1982,Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology
Generalized spike-and-slab priors for Bayesian group feature selection using expectation propagation,"We describe a Bayesian method for group feature selection in linear regression problems. The method is based on a generalized version of the standard spike-and-slab prior distribution which is often used for individual feature selection. Exact Bayesian inference under the prior considered is infeasible for typical regression problems. However, approximate inference can be carried out efficiently using Expectation Propagation (EP). A detailed analysis of the generalized spike-and-slab prior shows that it is well suited for regression problems that are sparse at the group level. Furthermore, this prior can be used to introduce prior knowledge about specific groups of features that are a priori believed to be more relevant. An experimental evaluation compares the performance of the proposed method with those of group LASSO, Bayesian group LASSO, automatic relevance determination and additional variants used for group feature selection. The results of these experiments show that a model based on the generalized spike-and-slab prior and the EP algorithm has state-of-the-art prediction performance in the problems analyzed. Furthermore, this model is also very useful to carry out sequential experimental design (also known as active learning), where the data instances that are most informative are iteratively included in the training set, reducing the number of instances needed to obtain a particular level of prediction accuracy.",2013,J.

Credit Scoring Menggunakan Regresi Logistik Lasso,"Credit scoring merupakan suatu metode berbasis analisis statistika yang digunakan untuk mengukur besaran resiko kredit. Metode klasifikasi yang paling populer digunakan untuk credit scoring adalah regresi logistik. Regresi logistik digunakan untuk memprediksi variabel respon yang biner dengan satu set variabel penjelas (prediktor). Regresi logistik mempunyai keterbatasan yaitu jika terdapat multikolinieritas (korelasi yang tinggi antar variabel bebas) membuat model regresi yang didapat menjadi tidak lagi efisien karena nilai standar error koefisien regresi menjadi sangat besar (overestimate) atau dengan kata lain mengurangi akurasi dari estimasi. Oleh karena itu, diusulkan metode Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) untuk mengatasi hal tersebut. LASSO akan menyusutkan koefisien (parameter IÂ²) yang berkorelasi, menjadi nol atau mendekati nol. Sehingga menghasilkan model akhir yang lebih representatif. Pada akhirnya, performa model regresi logistik LASSO dibandingkan dengan model regresi logistik. Dengan melihat nilai presentase ketepatan model, model regresi logistik LASSO dianggap lebih baik daripada model regresi logistik karena memiliki nilai presentase ketepatan model yang lebih besar. 
Credit scoring is a method based on a statistical analysis is used to measure the amount of credit risk. The most popular method of classification used for credit scoring is logistic regression. Logistic regression was used to predict the response variable is a binary with a set of explanatory variables (predictors). Logistic regression have limitations, if there is multicollinearity (a high correlation between independent variables) obtained makes regression model becomes more not efficient because the value of the standard error of regression coefficient becomes very large (overestimate), or in other words reduce the accuracy of the estimate. Therefore, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method proposed to overcome it. LASSO would shrink coefficient (parameter IÂ²), which correlated, to zero or close to zero. Resulting in a final model more representative. In the end, the performance of the logistic regression model LASSO compared with logistic regression model. By looking at the value of the percentage of accuracy from the model, the logistic regression model LASSO considered better than the logistic regression model because it has larger percentage of of models accuracy.",2016,
REMI: Regression with marginal information and its application in genome-wide association studies,"In this study, we consider the problem of variable selection and estimation in high-dimensional linear regression models when the complete data are not accessible, but only certain marginal information or summary statistics are available. This problem is motivated from the Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have been widely used to identify risk variants underlying complex human traits/diseases. With a large number of completed GWAS, statistical methods using summary statistics become more and more important because of restricted accessibility to individual-level data sets. Theoretically guaranteed methods are highly demanding to advance the statistical inference with a large amount of available marginal information. Here we propose an $\ell_1$ penalized approach, REMI, to estimate high dimensional regression coefficients with marginal information and external reference samples. We establish an upper bound on the error of the REMI estimator, which has the same order as that of the minimax error bound of Lasso with complete individual-level data. In particular, when marginal information is obtained from a large number of samples together with a small number of reference samples, REMI yields good estimation and prediction results, and outperforms the Lasso because the sample size of accessible individual-level data can be limited. Through simulation studies and real data analysis of the NFBC1966 GWAS data set, we demonstrate that REMI can be widely applicable.

Discovery and characterization of an isopeptidase that linearizes lasso peptides.,"Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally derived natural products with diverse bioactivities. The characteristic threaded lasso structure in these peptides derives from an isopeptide bond attaching the N-terminus of the peptide to an acidic side chain. Here we describe the heterologous expression of a lasso peptide gene cluster encoding two lasso peptides, astexin-2 and astexin-3, and solve the solution structure of astexin-3. This cluster also encodes an enzyme annotated as a protease. We show that this enzyme, AtxE2, is a lasso peptide isopeptidase that specifically hydrolyzes astexins-2 and -3, converting them to linear peptides. Astexin-3 is highly thermostable and resists unthreading after extensive heat treatment. In contrast, astexin-2 unthreads upon heat treatment. AtxE2 has no activity toward unthreaded astexin-2, demonstrating that this isopeptidase must recognize a knotted structure in order to function. We also use this isopeptidase as a tool to study evolutionary relationships between lasso peptide gene clusters.",2013,Journal of the American Chemical Society
Exact post-selection inference with the lasso,"We develop a framework for post-selection inference with the lasso. At the core of our framework is a result that characterizes the exact (non-asymptotic) distribution of linear combinations/contrasts of truncated normal random variables.

A Statistical Model of Rift Valley Fever Activity in Egypt,"ABSTRACT: 
 Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral disease of animals and humans and a global public health concern due to its ecological plasticity, adaptivity, and potential for spread to countries with a temperate climate. In many places, outbreaks are episodic and linked to climatic, hydrologic, and socioeconomic factors. Although outbreaks of RVF have occurred in Egypt since 1977, attempts to identify risk factors have been limited. Using a statistical learning approach (lasso-regularized generalized linear model), we tested the hypotheses that outbreaks in Egypt are linked to (1) River Nile conditions that create a mosquito vector habitat, (2) entomologic conditions favorable to transmission, (3) socio-economic factors (Islamic festival of Greater Bairam), and (4) recent history of transmission activity. Evidence was found for effects of rainfall and river discharge and recent history of transmission activity. There was no evidence for an effect of Greater Bairam. The model predicted RVF activity correctly in 351 of 358 months (98.0%). This is the first study to statistically identify risk factors for RVF outbreaks in a region of unstable transmission.",2013,
The prediction of venture capital co-investment based on structural balance theory,"In this paper, we study the prediction of co-investment of VCs. We present a series of observation analysis, design a large number of features, and then select prominent features for co-investment by group Lasso. Then we propose a factor graph model SBFG based on structural balance theory to formalize the observation into a unified model. Experiment results show that the proposed method can accurately (around 90% in terms of accuracy) predict the co-investment in the near future with only 10 features selected by group Lasso, and obtains a significant improvement over the baselines.",2016,2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)
Ott_a_235951 1087..1098,"Department of Neurosurgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, Peopleâ€™s Republic of China Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been verified to have a vital role in the progression of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Our research was about to identify the potential lncRNAs which was closely associated with the pathogenesis and prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme. Methods: All RNA sequence profiling data from patients with GBM were obtained from The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Differently expressed genes identified from GBM and control samples were used to construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and perform corresponding functional enrichment analysis. Univariate Cox regression followed by lasso regression and multivariate Cox was used to validate independent lncRNA factors and construct a risk prediction model. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to verify the expression levels of potential lncRNA biomarkers in human GBM clinical specimens. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was subsequently conducted to explore potential signaling pathways in which critical lncRNAs may be involved. Moreover, nomogram plot was applied based on our prediction model and significant clinical covariates to visualize the prognosis of GBM patients. Results: A total of 2023 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 56 lncRNAs, 1587 message RNAs (mRNAs) and 380 other RNAs were included. Based on predictive databases, 16lncRNAs, 32 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 99 mRNAs were used to construct a ceRNA network. Moreover, we performed a novel risk prediction model with 5 potential prognostic lncRNAs, in which 4 of them were newly identified in GBM, to predict the prognosis of GBM patients. Finally, a nomogram plot was constructed to illustrate the potential relationship between the prognosis of GBM and our risk prediction model and significant clinical covariates. Conclusion: In this study, we identified 4 novel potential lncRNA biomarkers and constructed a prediction model of GBM prognosis. A simple-to-use nomogram was provided for further clinical application.",2020,
Real-Time Predictive Modeling of Key Quality Characteristics Using Regularized Regression : SAS Â® Procedures GLMSELECT and LASSO,"This paper describes the merging of designed experiments and regularized regression to find the significant factors to use for a real-time predictive model. The real-time predictive model is used in a Weyerhaeuser modified fiber mill to estimate the value of several key quality characteristics. The modified fiber product is accepted or rejected based on the model prediction or the predicted values deviation from lab tests. To develop the model, a designed experiment was needed at the mill. The experiment was planned by a team of engineers, managers, operators, lab techs, and a statistician. The data analysis used the actual values of the process variables manipulated in the designed experiment. There were instances of the set point not being achieved or maintained for the duration of the run. The lab tests of the key quality characteristics were used as the responses. The experiment was designed with JMPÂ® 64-bit Edition 11.2.0 and estimated the two-way interactions of the process variables. It was thought that one of the process variables was curvilinear and this effect was also made estimable. The LASSO method, as implemented in the SASÂ® GLMSELECT procedure, was used to analyze the data after cleaning and validating the results. Cross validation was used as the variable selection operator. The resulting prediction model passed all the predetermined success criteria. The prediction model is currently being used real time in the mill for product quality acceptance.",2016,
Characteristics and clinical significance of spontaneous electrical activity in the big veins in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after electrical isolation,"Objective The characteristics of spontaneous electrical discharges in the electrically isolated myocardial sleeves of pulmonary veins(PV)and superior vene cava(SVC)were studied in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Methods Thirty-two patients with spontaneous PV and SVC electrical activities documented on intracardial electrophysiologic study(EPS)were included.After the electrical isolation by radiofrequency catheter ablation,lasso mapping catheter were remained in the big veins for 20 minutes to monitor the spontaneous potentials in each isolated PV or SVC.Results Spontaneous electrical discharges were recorded in 36 veins,including 31 PVs and 5 SVCs.After the segmental ablation at the veno-atiral junction with the end-point of disappearance of PV and SVC potentials during sinus rhythm and atrial pacing,16 veins(44%)demonstrated a spontaneous electrical activities,among which 11 veins showed a rhythm with an average rate of 35 bpm.Fifty of Sixty veins(93.8%)showed complete dissociation with the atrial potential,and only one left superior pulmonary vein had intermittent veno-atrium conduction which was blocked by another session of delivery of radiofrequency current.Conclusion The elimination of PV and SVC potentials during sinus rhythm or atrial pacing by segmental ablation at the ostium of the big veins generally indicates the occurrence of bi-directional conduction block between big veins and the atrium,which suggested the evaluation of exit block by pulmonary vein pacing is usually not required.The electrical discharges almost always resolved or significantly decreased upon big vein isolation,which suggests that the normal atrial electrical activity conducting into the vein played an important role to the occurrence of electrical firing in the veins.",2004,Chinese Journal of Cardiac Arrhythmias

Combined circular multielectrode catheter and point-by-point ablation is superior to point-by-point ablation alone in eliminating atrial fibrillation.,"BACKGROUND
Besides conventional point-by-point ablation, novel multielectrode catheters emerge for ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to evaluate the clinical utility of a pulmonary vein (PV) isolation approach combining the advantages of both technologies.


METHODS
The study included 240 consecutive AF patients (60Â±11 years, 68% males, 62% paroxysmal). In the combined ablation group (n=120), PV isolation was performed with a circular multielectrode catheter (PVAC, Medtronic Ablation Frontiers) and completed by conventional point-by-point ablation (NaviStar ThermoCool Catheter, Lasso/CARTO technology, Biosense Webster). In the point-by-point ablation group (n=120), PV isolation was performed with point-by-point ablation alone.


RESULTS
Complete 1-year ablation success (freedom from any atrial arrhythmia off antiarrhythmic drugs) was more frequently observed in the combined ablation group (58.0% versus 43.3%, hazard ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.19-2.48, p=0.004). Also clinical success (â‰¥90% reduction of arrhythmia burden on/off antiarrhythmic drugs) was significantly associated with the combined ablation approach (p=0.001). These associations remained significant after multivariable adjustment (both pâ‰¤0.005) and were not dependent on the type of AF. The rate of major adverse events (3.3% versus 2.5%) and the procedure time did not differ between groups. The fluoroscopy time, however, was significantly shorter in the combined ablation group (p<0.001) reflecting the reduced need for radiation during multielectrode catheter ablation.


CONCLUSIONS
A combined PV isolation approach based on multielectrode catheter ablation and complementary point-by-point ablation is superior to point-by-point ablation alone and reveals to be safe. A potential explanation for these findings is the improved durability of ablation lesion after the combined ablation approach.",2013,International journal of cardiology
M E ] 2 2 Ju l 2 01 9 A Pseudo Knockoff Filter for Correlated Features,"In [3], the authors introduced a new variable selection procedure called the knockoff filter to control the false discovery rate (FDR) and proved that this method achieves exact FDR control. Inspired by the work of [3], we propose a pseudo-knockoff filter that inherits some advantages of the original knockoff filter and has more flexibility in constructing its knockoff matrix. Moreover, we perform a number of numerical experiments that seem to suggest that the pseudo knockoff filter with the half Lasso statistic has FDR control and offers more power than the original knockoff filter with the Lasso Path or the half Lasso statistic for the numerical examples that we consider in this paper. Although we cannot establish rigorous FDR control for the pseudo knockoff filter, we provide some partial analysis of the pseudo knockoff filter with the half Lasso statistic and establish a uniform FDP bound and an expectation inequality.",2019,
The utilization of aromatic hydrocarbon by nitrate- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in single and multiple nitrate injection for souring control,"Abstract The application of nitrate-mediated souring control has been proposed as a promising tool. However, the efficiency of this method remains controversial due to several unresolved issues, such as the determination of effective nitrate concentration, the optimal injection period, etc. In this study, we investigated the depletion of specific hydrocarbons as the electron donor for sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB) by varying the nitrate concentration (1.5â€‰mM and 4.5â€‰mM) and injection timing (single, Ns; and multiple Nm) to control souring. Based on analysis of bacterial communities, genus Arcobacter was predominant, followed by NRB of family Rhodospirillaceae, which includes Thalassospira sp. By contrast, in the condition without nitrate addition (Nw/o), genus Desulfotignum was dominant. Both SRB and NRB share similar hydrocarbon preferences: toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. At the limiting nitrate concentration to suppress SRB activity, 1â€‰mM, SRB could co-exist with NRB and promote a more diverse bacterial community.",2019,Biochemical Engineering Journal
The possibility of applying Low Stress Stockhandling in reindeer,"The purpose of the study is to investigate the interest in Sami reindeer herders to use the Low Stress Stockhandling (LSS) method for handling reindeer. Also to find out which reindeer handling situations they think works the best and the worst, and which might need improvement. The purpose of LSS is to reduce the stress animals are subjected to during handling by creating consistent and calm responses from the animals. This is done by handling the animals through the animalsâ€™ point of view and using natural herd behavior to accomplish this. Data was collected through a ten question questionnaire distributed to reindeer herders. The questions intended to gain information on the background information about the participant, the aids used when managing reindeer, what handling situation the participants thought worked the best and worst the handling situation they believed is the most and least stressful for the reindeer, and if they thought that the stress reindeers are subjected to needs to be decreased. Other information collected included their thoughts about LSS and if they thought they would benefit from it during reindeer handling. Data received was complied together to get the total sum of all participants answers. 31 people answered the survey, 17 men and 14 women between the ages of 18and 52, with a mean age of 30. The aids used most were snowmobile and herding dog, and lasso was mostly used when capturing reindeer. When agreeing or disagreeing to the statement â€œThere is a need to reduce the stress that reindeers are exposed toâ€ on a seven point scale, where one was that they totally agreed and seven was that they totally disagreed; the mean value became 2,74. The handling situation that the participants thought worked the best was moving reindeer and the one that worked the worst was loading. The most stressful handling situation was also believed to be loading and the least stressful was gathering on bare ground. A majority of the participants (68%) thought that the LSS method could benefit them during reindeer handling. Loading and transportation was the handling situation participants found to be the most difficult, making loading a possible handling situation where LSS could be demonstrated and used by reindeer herders. Due to many managers involved in a reindeer herding district there can be difficulties in convincing everyone to participate in the new handling method. Reindeer are susceptible to handling stress. Therefore a reduction of the stress reindeers are exposed to during handling with LSS could benefit not only the reindeer, but also the reindeer herders and consumers of reindeer meat.",2011,
Association Between Radiomics Signature and Disease-Free Survival in Conventional Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma,"Patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) would benefit from risk stratification tools that can aid in planning personalized treatment and follow-up. The aim of this study was to develop a conventional ultrasound (US)-based radiomics signature to estimate disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with conventional PTC. Imaging features were extracted from the pretreatment US images of 768 patients with conventional PTC who were treated between January 2004 and February 2006. The median follow-up period was 117.3 months, with 85 (11.1%) events. A radiomics signature (Rad-score) was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method in Cox regression. The Rad-score was significantly associated with DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.087; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), independent of clinicopathologic risk factors. A radiomics model which incorporated the Rad-score demonstrated better performance in the estimation of DFS (C-index: 0.777; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.735, 0.829) than the clinicopathologic model (C-index: 0.721; 95% CI: 0.675, 0.780). In conclusion, radiomics features from pretreatment US may be potential imaging biomarkers for risk stratification in patients with conventional PTC.",2018,Scientific Reports
Electro-isolating cardiac venacava during atrial fibrillation guided by Lasso ring-designed electrode catheter,"Objective:To report cardiac venacava electro-isolated during atrial fibrillation of two patients guided by Lasso ring-designed electrode catheter. Method:Two patients were suffered from paroxysmal and sustained atrial fibrillation respectively according to the clinical symptoms and ECG recording. Two multiple eletrode catheters were placed in the right ventricle and coronary sinus for mapping and stimulation. Two decapolar Lasso ring-designed electrode catheter were positioned into the venacava for mapping after atrial transseptal puncture and angi-ography of venacava were performed. The target venacava was that where the earliest activity was appeared at the onset of atrial fibrillation or the most irregular activity was recorded during atrial fibrillation. Radiofrequency energy was delivered at the junctions of the target venacava and left atrium during atrial fibrillation. The end point of procedure was the termination of atrial fibrillation and disappearance of focal activity from venacava. Results: There were seven venacavas ablated in two patients. The atrial fibrillation of one patient was ended by ablating left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) .superior vena cava (SVC) and right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV). Another was ended by synchronous cardioversion after ablating left atrium isthmus, tricuspid valve, inferior vena cava isthmus, SVC, RSPV, LSPV and R1PV. The results during follow-up of one year were no recurrence of atrial fibrillation and no complications according to the atrial fibrillation. Conclusion: It's feasible for using lasso catheter to successfully treat atrial fibrillation by electro-isolating cardiac venacava.",2006,Journal of Clinical Cardiology
Automatic detection of frustration of novice programmers from contextual and keystroke logs,"Novice programmers exhibit a repertoire of affective states over time when they are learning computer programming. The modeling of frustration is important as it informs on the need for pedagogical intervention of the student who may otherwise lose confidence and interest in the learning. In this paper, contextual and keystroke features of the students within a Java tutoring system are used to detect frustration of student within a programming exercise session. As compared to psychological sensors used in other studies, the use of contextual and keystroke logs are less obtrusive and the equipment used (keyboard) is ubiquitous in most learning environment. The technique of logistic regression with lasso regularization is utilized for the modeling to prevent over-fitting. The results showed that a model that uses only contextual and keystroke features achieved a prediction accuracy level of 0.67 and a recall measure of 0.833. Thus, we conclude that it is possible to detect frustration of a student from distilling both the contextual and keystroke logs within the tutoring system with an adequate level of accuracy.",2015,2015 10th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE)
A three-stage method for sound field reproduction in rooms with reflection boundary:theory and experiments,"This paper presents a three-stage method for sound field reproduction in ordinary rooms. Optimization of speaker positions is important to reduce the number of speakers and the calculation time should be acceptable so that the algorithm can be put into practise. In the first stage of the proposed algorithm, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator(Lasso) is used to select the most important speakersâ€™ positions for all frequencies. Then l2-norm regularization is performed in the second stage to design the FIR filters. In the third stage, a fast convolution method based on Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) is carried out to reduce the time consuming of filtering algorithm. The performance of this three-stage method is investigated by experiments for different speaker numbers. The calculation time proves the efficiency of this method and the results of experiments show that compared with the widely used inverse filtering method, the proposed method can significantly reduce the speaker number without a serious side effects on the reproduction accuracy.",2014,

"Missing maternal deaths: Lessons from Souro Sanou University Hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","We investigated the location of maternal deaths in the Souro Sanou University Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. In all, the deaths of 585 women of reproductive age (12-49 years) were reviewed, and 132 (22.6%) were found to be maternal. Of these 132,43 (33.6%) occurred outside of the maternity unit. Some direct causes of death (eclampsia and sepsis) and indirect causes of death (cardiac illness and HIV/AIDS) would be omitted if only cases occurring on the maternity ward are investigated. Alarmingly, 93 (70%) of the 132 maternal deaths would have been missed in this hospital if we had used a narrow search process (excluding non-maternity wards) and narrow definition (excluding indirect causes). In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate the potential for seriously underestimating the magnitude of maternal mortality within facilities and for neglecting pregnant or recently pregnant women dying in non-maternity wards and from indirect complications.",2007,Tropical Doctor

Lasso tuning through the flexible-weighted bootstrap,"Regularized regression approaches such as the Lasso have been widely adopted for constructing sparse linear models in high-dimensional datasets. A complexity in fitting these models is the tuning of the parameters which control the level of introduced sparsity through penalization. The most common approach to select the penalty parameter is through $k$-fold cross-validation. While cross-validation is used to minimise the empirical prediction error, approaches such as the $m$-out-of-$n$ paired bootstrap which use smaller training datasets provide consistency in selecting the non-zero coefficients in the oracle model, performing well in an asymptotic setting but having limitations when $n$ is small. In fact, for models such as the Lasso there is a monotonic relationship between the size of training sets and the penalty parameter. We propose a generalization of these methods for selecting the regularization parameter based on a flexible-weighted bootstrap procedure that mimics the $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap and overcomes its challenges for all sample sizes. Through simulation studies we demonstrate that when selecting a penalty parameter, the choice of weights in the bootstrap procedure can be used to dictate the size of the penalty parameter and hence the sparsity of the fitted model. We empirically illustrate our weighted bootstrap procedure by applying the Lasso to integrate clinical and microRNA data in the modeling of Alzheimer's disease. In both the real and simulated data we find a narrow part of the parameter space to perform well, emulating an $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap, and that our procedure can be used to improve interpretation of other optimization heuristics.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Boundary-Thinking in Theories of the Present:,"Theories of the present, such as late capitalism, postmodernism, â€˜reflexive modernityâ€™ (U. Beck, 1994; Lyotard, 1979), or â€˜second modernityâ€™ attempt to name the current moment, proposing an epochal identity across diverse and contradictory social trends. While they provide a useful shorthand for more complex processes, their utility is less in their explanatory power than in their heuristic character and the ability to assimilate diverse cultural and economic research results into a single framework. They rely on their rhetorical force as extended metaphors, or literary conceits, as much as upon evidence. Lassooing the present, they organize the data of everyday life into narratives .",2006,
On the sparse Bayesian learning of linear models,"ABSTRACT This work is a re-examination of the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) of linear regression models of Tipping (2001) in a high-dimensional setting with a sparse signal. We show that in general the SBL estimator does not recover the sparsity structure of the signal. To remedy this, we propose a hard-thresholded version of the SBL estimator that achieves, for orthogonal design matrices, the non asymptotic estimation error rate of , where n is the sample size, p is the number of regressors, Ïƒ is the regression model standard deviation, and s is the number of non zero regression coefficients. We also establish that with high probability the estimator recovers the sparsity structure of the signal. In our simulations we found that the performance of thresholded SBL depends on the strength of the signal. With a weak signal thresholded SBL performs poorly compared to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) (Tibshirani, 1996), but outperforms lasso when the signal is strong.",2015,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
Ordinal Feature Selection for IRIS and Palm print Recognition,"Ordinal measures have been demonstrated as an effective feature representation model for iris and palmprint recognition. However, ordinal measures are a genera l concept of image analysis and numerous variants with different parameter settings, such as location, scale, orientation, and so on, can be derived to construct a huge feature space. This pap er proposes a novel optimization formulation for ordinal feature selection with successful applications to both iris and palmprint recognition. The objective function of the proposed feature sele ction method has two parts, i.e., misclassification error of int ra and interclass matching samples and weighted sparsity of ordinal f eature descriptors. Therefore, the feature selection aims to achieve an accurate and sparse representation of ordinal measu res. And, the optimization subjects to a number of linear inequal ity constraints, which require that all intra and interclass matching pairs are well separated with a large margin. Ordinal feature selection is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem so that a solution can be efficiently obtained even on a large-scale feature pool and training database. Extensive exper imental results demonstrate that the proposed LP formulation is advantageous over existing feature selection method s, such as mRMR, ReliefF, Boosting, and Lasso for biometric recognition, reporting stateof-the-art accuracy on CASIA and Pol yU databases.",2015,
Adaptive lasso for the Cox regression with interval censored and possibly left truncated data.,"We propose a penalized variable selection method for the Cox proportional hazards model with interval censored data. It conducts a penalized nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation with an adaptive lasso penalty, which can be implemented through a penalized EM algorithm. The method is proven to enjoy the desirable oracle property. We also extend the method to left truncated and interval censored data. Our simulation studies show that the method possesses the oracle property in samples of modest sizes and outperforms available existing approaches in many of the operating characteristics. An application to a dental caries data set illustrates the method's utility.",2019,Statistical methods in medical research
Channel selection for simultaneous myoelectric prosthesis control,"To develop a clinically available prosthesis based on electromyography (EMG) signals, the number of recording electrodes should be as small as possible. In this study, we investigate the possibility of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for finding electrode subsets suitable for regression based myoelectric prosthesis control. EMG signals were recorded using 192 electrodes while ten subjects were performing two degree-of-freedom (DoF) wrist movements. Among the whole channels, we selected subsets consisting of 96, 64, 48, 32, 24, 16, 12, and 8 electrodes, respectively, using the LASSO method. As a baseline method, electrode subsets having the same numbers of electrodes were arbitrary selected with regular spacing (uniform selection method). The performance of decoding the movements was estimated using the r-square value. The electrode subsets selected by the LASSO method generally outperformed those chosen by the arbitrary selection method. In particular, the performance of the LASSO method was significantly higher than that of the arbitrary selection method when using the subsets of 8 electrodes. From the analysis results, we could confirm that the LASSO method can be used to select reasonable electrode subsets for regression based myoelectric prosthesis control.",2014,2014 International Winter Workshop on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
Urine Fluoride Levels Following Ingestion of Fluoridated Domestic Salt over Three Years,"Many authors state that, provided the air and soil are free of F pollution, the most important source of fluorine for humans up to a level of 5 mg/1 F is drinking water; the urine F level depends on the drinking water; the fluoride content of the water drunk and of the urine is almost identical (BREDEMANN, 1956; DOMAZALKA and LASSOCINSKA, 1969; W.H.O., 1970; GEDALIA, 1958; JIRASKOVA and RUZICKA, 1959; LIKINS et al., 1956; McCLURE and KINSER, 1944; SAVAGE, 1967; SMITH, 1966; TRUSWELL, 1966; ZIPKIN et al., 1956).",1975,
Pregnant woman saved with liver transplantation from acute liver failure due to hepatitis E virus.,"Dear Sirs, Hepatitis E virus (HEV), the only virus within the genus Hepevirus and the family Hepeviridae [1], is one of the major causes of enterically transmitted hepatitis in many developing countries. Industrialized countries were considered nonendemic, but an increasing number of nontravelassociated cases of HEV infection have been reported in recent years, particularly in Europe [2,3]. While acute HEV infection is considered a self-limiting liver disease, with a 0.2â€“4% mortality rate [4], it sometimes progresses to acute liver failure (ALF), especially in pregnant women and in patients with pre-existing chronic liver diseases. In particular, the hepatitis E-induced mortality rate during pregnancy ranges from 15% to 25% [4â€“6] when the infection is contracted in the third trimester of pregnancy. Although it is not understood why HEV infection is associated with severe liver injury in pregnant women, ALF during pregnancy is known to be associated with a higher viral load of HEV, compared with those of acute hepatitis [7,8]. Bose et al. [8] reported that the severe course in pregnant women is related to a reduction in the expression of progesterone-receptor, which led to a predominance of T-helper type 1 lymphocytes. This immunologic shift results in an exuberant cytotoxic T-cell reaction resulting in foetal and maternal injury. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a treatment option for patients with ALF. To the best of our knowledge, OLT has never been performed before for HEV-induced ALF. A 28-year-old Asian pregnant woman was admitted in urgency in the obstetric-gynaecological unit due to persistent vomiting associated with abdominal pain and general malaise. The patient had returned from her country of origin in Southeast Asia 2 weeks before, after a 1-month stay. The patient had no history of prior liver disease or drug intake. Vital signs were within normal limits, as well as the gynaecological examination. Cardiotocography and the trans-vaginal and abdominal sonograms were normal. On physical examination, the patient was alert, oriented, with mildly impaired speech and scleral jaundice. The abdomen was slightly tender, with no signs of peritoneal reaction or ascites; the liver was not enlarged. Blood analysis demonstrated the following abnormalities: white blood count 15.7 9 10/mmc, international normalized ratio (INR) 4.69, glucose 58 mg/dl, total/conjugate bilirubin (TB/CB) 19.01/13.48 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 529 U/l, alanine aminotrasferase (ALT) 848 U/l, ammonium 74 lM, lactate dehydrogenase 285 U/l and lactic acid 6.9 mM. The calculated Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 33. The patient was then moved to the intensive care unit (ICU), where was started a treatment with high dosage N-acetylcysteine and fresh frozen plasma. Major causes of acute hepatitis, including hepatitis A, B, C, cytomegalovirus, Epsteinâ€“Barr, herpes simplex and varicella zoster viruses were ruled out using serological and/or molecular testing. Gynaecological causes of hepatic function impairment (i.e. HELLP syndrome, intrahepatic cholestasis and acute fatty liver of pregnancy) were ruled out, as well as hepatic masses and portal or hepatic veins thrombosis. Due to the recent trip in an endemic area, a blood sample to test HEV IgG and IgM as well as HEV-RNA was sent to the Virology Unit of the University of Parma. According to the Kingâ€™s College Hospital criteria for nonacetaminophen-induced ALF, OLT is indicated if three on the five considered parameters are satisfied (unfavourable aetiology of the disease, age of the patient <10 or >40 years, duration of jaundice before the onset of hepatic encephalopathy >7 days, INR > 3.5, TB > 17.5 mg/dl), as death occurred in 97% of the cases in absence of OLT [9]. According to this guideline, the patient was subsequently listed for emergency OLT for unknown acute hepatic necrosis. After the correction of the coagulation, the patient underwent emergency caesarean section. The baby, a 1.7-kg boy, was transferred in the Neonatal ICU for the supportive cares. After delivery, anti-HEV empirical treatment with ribavirin (RBV) 15 mg/kg/day was started. The day after the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E was confirmed by the detection of anti-HEV (both IgG and IgM) in the serum",2014,Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation
Sexual Dysfunction and Mood Stabilizers in Long-Term Stable Patients With Bipolar Disorder.,"BACKGROUND
In addition to factors intrinsic to bipolar disorder (BD), sexual functioning (SF) can be affected by extrinsic causes, such as psychotropic drugs. However, the effect of mood stabilizers on SF and quality of life (QoL) is an underexplored research area.


AIM
To analyze SF in BD outpatients in euthymia for at least 6Â months treated only with mood stabilizers and the association between SF and QoL.


METHODS
A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in 114 BD outpatients treated with (i) lithium alone (L group); (ii) anticonvulsants alone (valproate or lamotrigine; A group); (iii) lithium plus anticonvulsants (L+A group); or (iv) lithium plus benzodiazepines (L+B group). The Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire Short Form (CSFQ-14) was used. Statistical analyses were performed to compare CSFQ-14 scores among the pharmacological groups. An adaptive lasso was used to identify potential confounding variables, and linear regression models were used to study the association of the CSFQ-14 with QoL.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Self-reports on phases of the sexual response cycle (ie, desire, arousal, and orgasm) and QoL were assessed.


RESULTS
The A group had better total SF scores than the L group and the L+B group. Relative to the A group, the L and L+B groups had worse sexual desire; the L group had worse sexual arousal; and the L+A group and the L+B group had worse sexual orgasm. Regarding sociodemographic factors, being female and older age were associated with worse total SF and all subscale scores. Among all subscales scores, higher sexual arousal scores were associated with better QoL.


CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
Potential modified extrinsic factors such as psychotropic medication that can affect SF can be addressed and adjusted to lessen side effects on SF.


STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS
Sample of patients with euthymic BD in treatment with mood stabilizers and no antipsychotics or antidepressants, substance use as an exclusion criterion, and use of a validated, gender-specific scale to evaluate SF. Major limitations were cross-sectional design, sample size, and lack of information about stability of relationship with partner.


CONCLUSIONS
Lithium in monotherapy or in combination with benzodiazepines is related to worse total SF and worse sexual desire than anticonvulsants in monotherapy. While the addition of benzodiazepines or anticonvulsants to lithium negatively affects sexual orgasm, sexual arousal (which plays a significant role in QoL) improves when benzodiazepines are added to lithium. Anticonvulsants in monotherapy have the least negative effects on SF in patients with BD. GarcÃ­a-Blanco A, GarcÃ­a-Portilla MP, Fuente-TomÃ¡s L de la, etÂ al.

"Integrated sedimentological and palynological analysis from Early Cretaceous estuarine deposits in the southern-central NeuquÃ©n Basin, Argentina","Abstract The Mulichinco Formation represents one of the main gas producer unit in the Neuquen Basin and particularly, an improvement in its reservoir qualities are mostly indicated in subsurface for its upper section. Because the economic importance of this interval, sedimentological and palynological analysis were made on deposits from outcrops of the upper section of the unit, located at the southern-central Neuquen Basin. The studied section includes four main facies association which represent accumulations in a wave-dominated estuary, non-previously described for the Mulichinco Formation in the study area. In addition, sixty-six new palynomorphs species were identified which were new for the unit, including fifty-six spore species, twenty-five pollen grain taxa, and two algae. Ferns and conifers species were identified as dominant taxa. Moreover, mega and palynofloristic assemblages provide information about drainage conditions of the inhabited environment, suggesting spatial variations when comparing upland subaerial well-drained plains with lowland subaqueous poorly-drained areas and, at the same time, climatic variations are considered, inferring temperate to warm and wet palaeoclimatic conditions. The integration of sedimentological and palynological interpretations provides a more complete picture of the Valanginian estuarine system and ecosystem that developed towards the southern-central area of the Neuquen Basin. Furthermore, the studied palynological assemblages are consistent with a Late Valanginian age, and can be referred to the Zone 2 and to the Cyclusphaera psilata-Classopollis Association suggested for the Neuquen Basin.",2019,Journal of South American Earth Sciences

Lipidomic analysis of plasma samples from women with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Abstract
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder affecting between 5 and 18Â % of females of reproductive age and can be diagnosed based on a combination of clinical, ultrasound and biochemical features, none of which on its own is diagnostic. A lipidomic approach using liquid chromatography coupled with accurate mass high-resolution mass-spectrometry (LC-HRMS) was used to investigate if there were any differences in plasma lipidomic profiles in women with PCOS compared with control women at different stages of menstrual cycle. Plasma samples from 40 women with PCOS and 40 controls aged between 18 and 40Â years were analysed in combination with multivariate statistical analyses. Multivariate data analysis (LASSO regression and OPLS-DA) of the sample lipidomics datasets showed a weak prediction model for PCOS versus control samples from the follicular and mid-cycle phases of the menstrual cycle, but a stronger model (specificity 85Â % and sensitivity 95Â %) for PCOS versus the luteal phase menstrual cycle controls. The PCOS vs luteal phase model showed increased levels of plasma triglycerides and sphingomyelins and decreased levels of lysophosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines in PCOS women compared with controls. Lipid biomarkers of PCOS were tentatively identified which may be useful in distinguishing PCOS from controls especially when performed during the menstrual cycle luteal phase.",2014,Metabolomics
Robust Sparse Regression under Adversarial Corruption,"We consider high dimensional sparse regression with arbitrary - possibly, severe or coordinated - errors in the covariates matrix. We are interested in understanding how many corruptions we can tolerate, while identifying the correct support. To the best of our knowledge, neither standard outlier rejection techniques, nor recently developed robust regression algorithms (that focus only on corrupted response variables), nor recent algorithms for dealing with stochastic noise or erasures, can provide guarantees on support recovery. As we show, neither can the natural brute force algorithm that takes exponential time to find the subset of data and support columns, that yields the smallest regression error. 
 
We explore the power of a simple idea: replace the essential linear algebraic calculation - the inner product - with a robust counterpart that cannot be greatly affected by a controlled number of arbitrarily corrupted points: the trimmed inner product. We consider three popular algorithms in the uncorrupted setting: Thresholding Regression, Lasso, and the Dantzig selector, and show that the counterparts obtained using the trimmed inner product are provably robust.",2013,
Generalizing to Unseen Domains via Adversarial Data Augmentation,"We are concerned with learning models that generalize well to different \emph{unseen} domains. We consider a worst-case formulation over data distributions that are near the source domain in the feature space. Only using training data from a single source distribution, we propose an iterative procedure that augments the dataset with examples from a fictitious target domain that is ""hard"" under the current model. We show that our iterative scheme is an adaptive data augmentation method where we append adversarial examples at each iteration. For softmax losses, we show that our method is a data-dependent regularization scheme that behaves differently from classical regularizers that regularize towards zero (e.g., ridge or lasso). On digit recognition and semantic segmentation tasks, our method learns models improve performance across a range of a priori unknown target domains.",2018,
A re-description of Sandownia harrisi (Testudinata: Sandownidae) from the Aptian of the Isle of Wight based on computed tomography scans,"Sandownidae is an enigmatic group of Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene turtles with highly derived cranial anatomy. Although sandownid monophyly is not debated, relationships with other turtles remain unclear. Sandownids have been recovered in significantly different parts of the turtle tree: as stem-turtles, stem-cryptodires and stem-chelonioid sea turtles. Latest phylogenetic studies find sandownids as the sister-group of the Late Jurassic thalassochelydians and as stem-turtles. Here, we provide a detailed study of the cranial and mandibular anatomy of Sandownia harrisi from the Aptian of the Isle of Wight, based on high resolution computed tomography scanning of the holotype. Our results confirm a high number of anatomical similarities with thalassochelydians and particularly Solnhofia parsonsi, which is interpreted as an early member of the sandownid lineage. Sandownids + Solnhofia show many cranial modifications related to the secondary palate and a durophagous diet. Sandownia is additionally highly derived in features related to its arterial circulation and neuroanatomy, including the endosseous labyrinth. Our results imply rapid morphological evolution during the early history of sandownids. Sandownids likely evolved in central Europe from thalassochelydian ancestors during the Late Jurassic. The durophagous diet of sandownids possibly facilitated their survival of the Cretaceous/Paleogene mass extinction.",2020,Royal Society Open Science
Special issue on Model Selection and High Dimensional Data Reduction,"Nowadays we are often confronted with data sets containing many variables; in some cases the number of variables exceeds the sample size. Indeed, many modern scientific investigations require the analysis of high dimensional data. Examples include genomic and proteomic data, spatial-temporal data, network data, and many others. Modeling such data and in particular high-dimensional data poses many challenges, often involving complex data structures. Specifically, a range of different models with varying complexity can be considered and a model that is optimal in some sense needs to be selected from a set of candidate models. Simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation play a central role in such investigations. There is now an immense literature on variable selection, and penalized regression methods are becoming increasingly popular. Many new developments have been published in recent years by leading statistical journals. The application of regression models for high-dimensional data analysis is a challenging task. Regularization techniques have attracted much attention in the literature. Penalized regression is a technique for mitigating difficulties arising from collinearity and high-dimensionality. This approach necessarily incurs an estimation bias, while reducing the variance of the estimator. A tuning parameter is needed to adjust the effect of the penalization so that a desirable balance between model parsimony and goodness-of-fit can be achieved. Different forms of penalty functions have been studied intensively over the last two decades. Examples include the LASSO and its many variants (such as adaptive LASSO, group LASSO, relaxed LASSO, and so on), the SCAD, the Dantzig selector, and the elastic net, to name just a few. More recently, some of these penalization/regularization techniques have been extended to deal with the estimation of large covariance matrices, and the analysis of complex dependence structures such as networks and graphs. This special issue focuses on computationally efficient strategies, methodology and applications concerning the analysis of complex, high dimensional data set with a focus on model selection and data reduction. The papers contained in this issue deal with submodel selection and parameter estimation for a host of statistical models.

The global politics of education: Brazil and the World Bank,"This paper questions the cultural neutrality of modernizationand globalization policies that are imposed by major internationalmonetary agencies. The authors propose that the structuraladjustment policies imposed by the World Bank and InternationalMonetary Fund are predominantly guided by the concept of developmentalassociation. Guided by this concept, the dominant countries andagencies perceive all developing countries to be merely culturalvariations of the same problem that assumes all countries requirethe same solutions. Through an analysis of the failures of WorldBank programs in Brazil and other developing countries, the authorsargue for greater recognition of the problems inherent in imposingcosmopolitan and global solutions on local contexts. The authorsconclude that globalized solutions for local contexts areinappropriate when they are formulated out of ignorance of thelocal culture and context.",2002,Higher Education

A Mathematical Framework for Feature Selection from Real-World Data with Non-Linear Observations,"In this paper, we study the challenge of feature selection based on a relatively small collection of sample pairs $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{1 \leq i \leq m}$. The observations $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ are thereby supposed to follow a noisy single-index model, depending on a certain set of signal variables. A major difficulty is that these variables usually cannot be observed directly, but rather arise as hidden factors in the actual data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (feature variables). We will prove that a successful variable selection is still possible in this setup, even when the applied estimator does not have any knowledge of the underlying model parameters and only takes the 'raw' samples $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{1 \leq i \leq m}$ as input. The model assumptions of our results will be fairly general, allowing for non-linear observations, arbitrary convex signal structures as well as strictly convex loss functions. This is particularly appealing for practical purposes, since in many applications, already standard methods, e.g., the Lasso or logistic regression, yield surprisingly good outcomes. Apart from a general discussion of the practical scope of our theoretical findings, we will also derive a rigorous guarantee for a specific real-world problem, namely sparse feature extraction from (proteomics-based) mass spectrometry data.",2016,ArXiv
"Jointly Learning Sentiment, Keyword and Opinion Leader in Social Reviews","Social review sites offer a wealth of information beyond sentiment polarity. For instance, on IMDb users leave valuable reviews on different aspects of a movie (e.g. Actors, visual effects). This inspires researchers to fully discover information from social review texts for the sake of modelling users behavior. Previous studies have spent a large amount of effort to identify sentiment scores from reviews. Yet questions like ""What are the key plot in this movie?"" and ""Who is the valuable user I should follow?"", the answers of which comprehensively support user decision making process, can not be answered in those works. To jointly learn from sentiment, text and user in social reviews, we draw inspiration that only a small portion of reviewers can generate useful information, and propose a sparse overlapping user lasso model to tackle these challenges. In addition, we show how to efficiently solve the resulting optimization challenges using the alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM), a framework which divides our objective into sub-tasks that are easy to fulfill. By experimenting several experiments on 3 real world social review datasets, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art models in sentiment classification tasks, meanwhile generating accurate results on keywords discovering and opinion leader identification task.",2015,2015 IEEE Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)
Process Integrated Inspection of Fiber Composite Parts Using Computed Tomography,"Fiber composite parts are often made up of several layers of woven or non-crimp fabrics consisting of glassor carbon-fibers. For purpose of quality control, non-destructive testing methods have to be applied to find possible defects. Typical defects are pores and voids on the matrix-side and undulations, broken fibers, fiber misplacements, etc on the fiber-side. Until recently system cost and processing speed of a Computed Tomography (CT) system capable of computing three-dimensional (3D) images prevented its widespread use except for special applications, e.g. offline inspection of prototypes in the lab. With the steady advances in processing speed in conjunction with optimized 3D image processing algorithms, it is now possible to integrate a CT system into the process, offering 3D reconstruction and fully automatic defect detection. This is referred to as Inline-CT. In this contribution we show the possible application of an Inline-CT system to the inspection of fiber composite parts. The performance of the system is shown on CTscans of a CFRP-clip, which is a part used for structure connecting purposes in modern aircrafts.",2012,
An integrative DNA methylation model for improved prognostication of postsurgery recurrence and therapy in prostate cancer patients.,"PURPOSE
Patients with clinically localized, high-risk prostate cancer are often treated with surgery, but exhibit variable prognosis requiring long-term monitoring. An ongoing challenge for such patients is developing optimal strategies and biomarkers capable of differentiating between men at risk of early recurrence (<3 years) that will benefit from adjuvant therapies and men at risk of late recurrence (>5 years) who will benefit from long-term monitoring and/or salvage therapies.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
DNA methylation changes for 12 genes associated with disease progression were analyzed in 453 prostate tumors. A 4-gene prognostic model (4-G model) for biochemical recurrence (BCR) was derived utilizing LASSO from Cohort 1 (nâ€¯=â€¯254) and validated in Cohort 2 (nâ€¯=â€¯199). Subsequently, the 4-G model was evaluated for its association with salvage radiotherapy (RT) and/or hormone therapy, and the additive potential to CAPRA-S to develop an integrative gene model was assessed.


RESULTS
The 4-G model was significantly associated with BCR in both cohorts (chi-squared analysis Pâ‰¤ 0.004) and specifically, with late recurrence at 5+ years (P < 0.001, Cohort 1; P= 0.028, Cohort 2). Multivariable Cox proportional regression analysis identified the 4-G model as significantly associated with salvage RT or hormone therapy in Cohort 1 (hazard ratio (HR) 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-2.10, P< 0.001) and further validated in Cohort 2 (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.18-2.25, P< 0.001). The integrative model outperformed prostate-specific antigen and the 4-G model alone for predicting BCR and was associated with patients who received hormone therapy 3+ years postsurgery.


CONCLUSIONS
We have identified and validated a novel integrative gene model as an independent prognosticator of BCR and demonstrated its association with late BCR. These patients require more long-term postsurgical monitoring and could be spared the comorbidities of adjuvant therapies.",2019,Urologic oncology
A short review of machine learning methods for classifying the outcome of Gestational Diabetes,"Diabetes mellitus is a growing problem, especially in developing countries. People suffering from diabetes have an increased risk of developing a number of serious health problems. Consistently high blood glucose levels can lead to serious diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels, eyes, kidney, etc. In addition, people with diabetes also have a higher risk of developing infections. This paper aims to use suitable data mining and classification techniques which include the Logit model, the Probit model, the Classification tree technique, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Ridge Regression technique and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator(LASSO) in order to determine the best method which can be used to classify the patients as suffering from gestational diabetes or not. The misclassification rate is calculated for different methods and the method having the least misclassification rate is said to be the most suitable to be applied to the given data, which is the PIMA Indians diabetes dataset.",2019,bioRxiv
AUC-based biomarker ensemble with an application on gene scores predicting low bone mineral density,"MOTIVATION
The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), long regarded as a 'golden' measure for the predictiveness of a continuous score, has propelled the need to develop AUC-based predictors. However, the AUC-based ensemble methods are rather scant, largely due to the fact that the associated objective function is neither continuous nor concave. Indeed, there is no reliable numerical algorithm identifying optimal combination of a set of biomarkers to maximize the AUC, especially when the number of biomarkers is large.


RESULTS
We have proposed a novel AUC-based statistical ensemble methods for combining multiple biomarkers to differentiate a binary response of interest. Specifically, we propose to replace the non-continuous and non-convex AUC objective function by a convex surrogate loss function, whose minimizer can be efficiently identified. With the established framework, the lasso and other regularization techniques enable feature selections. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the superiority of the new methods to the existing methods. The proposal has been applied to a gene expression dataset to construct gene expression scores to differentiate elderly women with low bone mineral density (BMD) and those with normal BMD. The AUCs of the resulting scores in the independent test dataset has been satisfactory.


CONCLUSION
Aiming for directly maximizing AUC, the proposed AUC-based ensemble method provides an efficient means of generating a stable combination of multiple biomarkers, which is especially useful under the high-dimensional settings.

Differentiating minimally invasive and invasive adenocarcinomas in patients with solitary sub-solid pulmonary nodules with a radiomics nomogram.,"AIM
To evaluate the preoperative differentiation between the minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) and invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) in patients with sub-solid pulmonary nodules using a radiomics nomogram.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 100 patients with sub-solid pulmonary nodules who had pathologically confirmed MIA (43 patients, 13 male and 30 female) or IAC (57 patients, 26 male and 31 female) were recruited retrospectively. Radiomics features were extracted from computed tomography (CT) images. A radiomics signature was constructed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. Solid presence, lesion size, shape regularity, and margins of pulmonary nodules were assessed to construct a subjective finding model. An integrated model of radiomics signatures and CT-based subjective findings, which was presented as a radiomics nomogram, was developed based on a multivariate logistic regression. The nomogram performance was assessed by its calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness.


RESULTS
The radiomics signature, which consisted of 11 radiomics features, showed good discrimination accuracy. The radiomics nomogram showed good calibration and discrimination in the training set (AUC [area under the curve] 0.943; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.895-0.991) and validation set (AUC 0.912; 95% CI: 0.780-1.000). The radiomics nomogram was determined to be clinically useful in the decision curve analysis (DCA).


CONCLUSION
The proposed radiomics nomogram has the potential to preoperatively differentiate MIA and IAC in patients with sub-solid pulmonary nodules.",2019,Clinical radiology
Participation and performance on paper- and computer-based low-stakes assessments,"BackgroundHigh-stakes assessments, such the Graduate Records Examination, have transitioned from paper to computer administration. Low-stakes research-based assessments (RBAs), such as the Force Concept Inventory, have only recently begun this transition to computer administration with online services. These online services can simplify administering, scoring, and interpreting assessments, thereby reducing barriers to instructorsâ€™ use of RBAs. By supporting instructorsâ€™ objective assessment of the efficacy of their courses, these services can stimulate instructors to transform their courses to improve student outcomes. We investigate the extent to which RBAs administered outside of class with the online Learning About STEM Student Outcomes (LASSO) platform provide equivalent data to tests administered on paper in class, in terms of both student participation and performance. We use an experimental design to investigate the differences between these two assessment conditions with 1310 students in 25 sections of 3 college physics courses spanning 2 semesters.ResultsAnalysis conducted using hierarchical linear models indicates that student performance on low-stakes RBAs is equivalent for online (out-of-class) and paper-and-pencil (in-class) administrations. The models also show differences in participation rates across assessment conditions and student grades, but that instructors can achieve participation rates with online assessments equivalent to paper assessments by offering students credit for participating and by providing multiple reminders to complete the assessment.ConclusionsWe conclude that online out-of-class administration of RBAs can save class and instructor time while providing participation rates and performance results equivalent to in-class paper-and-pencil tests.",2018,International Journal of Stem Education
"STELIOS PANAYOTAKIS (ED.), The Story of Apollonius, King of Tyre. A Commentary","STELIOS PANAYOTAKIS (ED.): The Story of Apollonius, King of Tyre. A Commentary Texte undKommentare 38 2012. Pp. VIII, 682. Berlin--Boston: De Gruyter. Hard cover 129,95 [euro] / $ 182.00 ISBN 978-3-11-021412-3 Gli studiosi di narrativa antica hanno atteso il commento di Stelios Panayotakis alla Historia Apollonii regis Tyri--piu precisamente alla piu antica redazione del romanzo a noi pervenuta, la cosiddetta 'redazione A' (RA) per piu di un decennio, un lasso di tempo che non sorprende vista l'intricatissima trasmissione dell'opera, la sua quasi inattingibile storia e la relativa scarsita di indagini scientifiche condotte su di essa prima che il florido revival di studi sulla narrativa greca e latina la portasse alla ribalta. Ma oggi quest'attesa puo dirsi pienamente rimunerata: il commento di P., sebbene limitato alla sola RA, costituisce uno strumento di lavoro senza eguali nel panorama degli studi sulla Storia di Apollonio e rappresenta al contempo una sintesi delle ricerche precedenti e un imprescindibile punto di partenza per ulteriori indagini. Dopo una breve prefazione che presenta il lavoro, ne descrive la genesi e ne individua le fondamenta, una prima sezione introduttiva (pp. 1-10) riassume in otto lucidi paragrafi gli aspetti generali dell'opera e i principali risultati emersi nel lavoro di commento (""Authorship and Date"", ""Structure and Content"", ""Space and Time"", ""The Narrative Situation"", ""Genre and Literary Texture"", ""Religion"", ""Language and Style"", ""Transmission of the Text and Sigla"") mantenendosi per lo piu ancorata a fatti noti o probabili senza dilungarsi in pericolose speculazioni congetturali che, nel caso di un testo tanto particolare, avrebbero rischiato di dilatare inutilmente la trattazione. Una pregevole caratteristica, questa, che distingue il lavoro di P. da svariati studi precedenti e che consente al lettore di farsi un'idea precisa e attendibile sulle principali teorie e linee di studio. P. concorda con Kortekaas nel collocare la stesura della RA tra la fine del V e gli inizi del VI secolo, una datazione accettata dai piu, ma fondata su indizi piuttosto generici--prevalentemente linguistici--opportunamente riscontrati nel commento. La conferma piu significativa di un'elaborazione in epoca tarda proviene dai numerosi raffronti istituibili con la Vulgata (cf. Index locorum, s.v.), la cui notorieta, sullo scorcio del V secolo, era gia abbastanza vasta. La confezione della redazione sembra opera di un'unica personalita che, rielaborando un testo anonimo 'aperto' alle variazioni--la disposizione dell'Apollonio a subire modifiche e documentata dalle differenze fra le diverse redazioni e fra i testimoni di una medesima redazione--, ha agito come un autore, contraddistinto da un proprio stile e da una propria tecnica letteraria. La struttura della narrazione rispecchia probabilmente quella originaria: la sua unita e la sua coerenza sembrerebbero comprovate dalla presenza di ripetizioni tematiche, parallelismi e antitesi, tutti elementi che inducono P. a dubitare che il testo sia stato epitomato nel corso della tradizione come invece ipotizzano Klebs, Merkelbach e Kortekaas. I passi che hanno destato perplessita in questo senso sono esaminati nel commento, e P. offre risposte alternative per lo piu sensate a molti dei sospetti avanzati da Kortekaas: cf. le note a 6.6 sul carico di grano; 8.3 su Ellenico; 24.1 sull'arrivo improvviso di Apollonio; 25.11 sull'assenza di un riferimento ai codicilli; 28.7 sull'esilio di Apollonio nelle ignotae et longinquae terre egiziane. Qualche dubbio puo restare in casi come 39.1, dove la tempesta che porta Apollonio a Mitilene anziche a Tiro e abbozzata in due righe; o sull'interpretazione di 45.2 pereat ista civitas come maledizione, una possibilita smentita dallo sviluppo della narrazione (45.3-46.3), per cui la generalizzazione di Apollonio appare poco motivata, tanto piu che i Mitilenesi erano stati pietosi con Tarsia. Piu problematici sono l'oscurita dell'indovinello di Antioco, o la ragione per cui alla sua morte il regno di Antiochia spetti ad Apollonio (cf. â€¦",2015,Ancient narrative
"PalinoestratigrafÃ­a del Tithoniano-Hauteriviano del Centro-Oeste de la Cuenca Neuquina, Argentina","espanolSe presenta una palinozonacion preliminar para el intervalo Tithoniano-Hauteriviano en el centro-oeste de la Cuenca Neuquina.

"Anaemia during pregnancy in Burkina Faso, west Africa, 1995-96: prevalence and associated factors. DITRAME Study Group.","We report the results of a cross-sectional study carried out in 1995-96 on anaemia in pregnant women who were attending two antenatal clinics in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, as part of a research programme including a clinical trial of zidovudine (ZDV) in pregnancy (ANRS 049 Clinical Trial). For women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Africa, anaemia is of particular concern when considering the use of ZDV to decrease mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The objectives were to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for maternal anaemia in the study population, and the effect of HIV infection on the severity of maternal anaemia. HIV counselling and testing were offered to all women, and haemograms were determined for those women who consented to serological testing. Haemoglobin (Hb) levels were available for 2308 of the 2667 women who accepted HIV testing. The prevalence of HIV infection was 9.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.6-10.8%). The overall prevalence of anaemia during pregnancy (Hb level < 11 g/dl) was 66% (95% CI: 64-68%). The prevalence of mild (10 g/dl < or = Hb < 11 g/dl), moderate (7 g/dl < or = Hb < 10 g/dl) and severe (Hb < 7 g/dl) anaemia was 30.8%, 33.5% and 1.7%, respectively. The prevalence of anaemia was 78.4% in HIV-infected women versus 64.7% in HIV-seronegative women (P < 0.001). Although the relative risk of HIV-seropositivity increased with the severity of anaemia, no significant association was found between degree of anaemia and HIV serostatus among the study women with anaemia. Logistic regression analysis showed that anaemia was significantly and independently related to HIV infection, advanced gestational age, and low socioeconomic status. This study confirms the high prevalence of anaemia during pregnancy in Burkina Faso. Antenatal care in this population must include iron supplementation. Although HIV-infected women had a higher prevalence of anaemia, severe anaemia was infrequent, possibly because few women were in the advanced stage of HIV disease. A short course regimen of ZDV should be well tolerated in this population.",1999,Bulletin of the World Health Organization
Material search for Li-ion battery electrolytes through an exhaustive search with a Gaussian process,"Abstract When creating an estimation model, determining which variables are efficient is of considerable importance. To strictly select efficient variables, it is necessary to define appropriate criteria for the task and to perform an exhaustive search, which is the search method that evaluates and compares all variable combinations. In this study, we apply an exhaustive search with a Gaussian process (ES-GP) to estimate coordination energy, which is related to performance of a Li-ion battery, and show that the estimation accuracy of ES-GP is significantly better than that of other methods in previous studies, such as MLR, LASSO and ES-LiR.",2019,Chemical Physics Letters
A Note on the Effect on Power of Score Tests via Dimension Reduction by Penalized Regression under the Null,"We consider the problem of score testing for certain low dimensional parameters of interest in a model that could include finite but high dimensional secondary covariates and associated nuisance parameters. We investigate the possibility of the potential gain in power by reducing the dimensionality of the secondary variables via oracle estimators such as the Adaptive Lasso. As an application, we use a recently developed framework for score tests of association of a disease outcome with an exposure of interest in the presence of a possible interaction of the exposure with other co-factors of the model. We derive the local power of such tests and show that if the primary and secondary predictors are independent, then having an oracle estimator does not improve the local power of the score test. Conversely, if they are dependent, there is the potential for power gain. Simulations are used to validate the theoretical results and explore the extent of correlation needed between the primary and secondary covariates to observe an improvement of the power of the test by using the oracle estimator. Our conclusions are likely to hold more generally beyond the model of interactions considered here.",2010,The International Journal of Biostatistics
Identification of distributed-parameter systems from sparse measurements,"Abstract In this paper, a method for the identification of distributed-parameter systems is proposed, based on finite-difference discretization on a grid in space and time. The method is suitable for the case when the partial differential equation describing the system is not known. The sensor locations are given and fixed, but not all grid points contain sensors. Per grid point, a model is constructed by means of lumped-parameter system identification, using measurements at neighboring grid points as inputs. As the resulting model might become overly complex due to the involvement of neighboring measurements along with their time lags, the Lasso method is used to select the most relevant measurements and so to simplify the model. Two examples are reported to illustrate the effectiveness of the method, a simulated two-dimensional heat conduction process and the construction of a greenhouse climate model from real measurements.",2017,Applied Mathematical Modelling
[Evaluation of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis by Using Radiomics of Dual-modal Ultrasound Composed of Elastography and B-mode].,"OBJECTIVES
To explore the diagnostic value of quantitative radiomics features from dual-modal ultrasound composed of elastography and B-mode for axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients.


METHODS
We retrospectively analyzed 161 axillary lymph nodes (69 benign and 92 metastatic) undergoing real-time elastography and B-mode ultrasound from 158 patients with breast cancer. We extracted a total of 428 features, consisting of morphologic features from B-mode, and intensity features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix features from the dual modalities, and the optimal subsut of features was selected through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) under the condition of leave-one-out cross validation. We used SVM for the classification of benign and metastatic nodes.


RESULTS
The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Youden's index of the 35 radiomics features selected with Lasso were 86.96%, 85.51%, 86.34% and 72.46%, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
The radiomics features from dual-modal ultrasound (elastography and B-mode) have demonstrated good performance for classification and have potential to be applied to clinical diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis.",2017,Zhongguo yi liao qi xie za zhi = Chinese journal of medical instrumentation

Efficient parameter identification and model selection in nonlinear dynamical systems via sparse Bayesian learning,"Bayesian inference plays a central role in many of today's system identification algorithms. However, one of its major drawbacks is that it often requires solutions to analytically intractable integrals, and this has led to solutions via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Today, few Bayesian system identification methods can compete with the robustness of the family of MCMC solutions. However, MCMC suffers severely from its computational cost. 
 
 
 
Partly fuelled by the field of Compressive Sensing (CS), an interest in the machine learning community has arisen in sparse linear regression. Its value in identification of dynamical systems has also recently started to receive some attention. The idea is to represent the range of possible candidate functional forms that have generated a specific data set using a dictionary, and to then apply standard Lasso regression to select the ""best"" basis, with sparsity constraints. A major problem in this approach is that Lasso regression (and its derivatives) requires tuning of the regularisation parameter. In this paper, a procedure for selecting the ""best basis"" (and thus performing both model selection and system identification) is presented through a sparse Bayesian learning approach. Sparsity is induced via a hierarchical Gaussian prior and an approximation to the posterior distribution is sought using an iterative optimisation scheme for finding the optimal hyper-priors that govern prior and hence, the level of sparsity in the solution. The method is applied to five systems of engineering interest, which include a baseline linear system, an additive quadratic damping term, cubic stiffness (Duffing oscillator), Coulomb damping and a Bouc-Wen hysteresis model. The results are shown using numerical simulations. It is shown that this approach can identify not only the correct model parameters, but whether a nonlinearity is present in the system as well its type. With the formulation being Bayesian, it also yields estimates of uncertainty over the selected basis functions and predicted responses.",2019,

Les investigations entomologiques conduites en 2004 Ã  Bobo-Dioulasso ont montrÃ© que les canaris constituent 48,11 % des gÃ®tes des moustiques, suivis des fÃ»ts mÃ©talliques, avec une forte reprÃ©sentation de Culex quinquefasciatus (48,7 %), suivi par Aedes aegypti (43,3 %), comme vecteurs dans les zones domestiques, avec des variations dâ€™un secteur de rÃ©sidence Ã  lâ€™autre. Ces rÃ©sultats suggÃ¨rent quâ€™il faudrait sensibiliser davantage les autoritÃ©s sanitaires nationales et la communautÃ© internationale Ã  cette maladie.AbstractDespite the existence of antiamaril vaccine in the routine Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) in Burkina Faso, yellow fever cases still occur in the country. In collaboration with WHO, the national health authorities set up a surveillance system through the national reference laboratory in Centre Muraz (Bobo-Dioulasso). All samples of feverish icterus cases of the 63 health districts of the country were analysed in this lab for M Immunoglobulin using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Elisa). Positive Elisa samples were sent to Pasteur Institute of Dakar (Senegal) for confirmation using a Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay. From 2003 to 2005, the number of confirmed cases of yellow fever was respectively of 1/413 (0.24%), 14/616 (2.27%) and 19/618 (3.07%). This increasing of the proportion was statistical different. Then, from 2006 to 2008, the confirmed case proportion was respectively 0.35%, 0.27 and 0.54% without significant difference (P = 0.69). The entomological investigations conducted in 2004 in Bobo-Dioulasso showed that the water pots constitute 48.11% mosquitoes lodgings, followed by metal drums with a strong representation of Culex quinquefasciatus (48.7%), followed by Aedes aegypti (43.3%), as vectors in domestic areas with sectorial variations. These results suggest that more attention must be paid by the national health authorities and international community regarding this disease.",2010,Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© de pathologie exotique
Lossy audio signal compression via structured sparse decomposition and compressed sensing,"In this paper, we propose a method for lossy audio signal compression via structured sparse decomposition and compressed sensing (CS). In this method, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is employed to sparse and structured decompose the audio signals into tonal and transient layers, and then, both resulting layers are compressed by a CS method. By employing a new penalty term, which takes advantage of the structure information of transform coefficients, the LASSO is able to achieve a better sparse approximation of the audio signal than traditional methods do. In addition, we propose a sparsity allocation algorithm, which adjusts the sparsity between the two resulting layers, thus improving the performance of CS. Experimental results showed that the new method provided a better compression performance than conventional methods did.",2014,2014 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)
Penalized MM regression estimation with LÎ³ penalty: a robust version of bridge regression,"ABSTRACTThe bridge regression estimator generalizes both ridge regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) estimators. Since it minimizes the sum of squared residuals with a LÎ³ penalty, this estimator is typically not robust against outliers in the data. There have been attempts to define robust versions of the bridge regression method, but while these proposed methods produce bridge regression estimators robust to vertical outliers and heavy-tailed errors, they are not robust against leverage points. We propose a robust bridge regression estimation method combining MM and bridge regression estimation methods. The MM bridge regression estimator obtained from the proposed method is robust against vertical outliers and leverage points. Furthermore, for appropriate choices of the penalty function, the proposed method is able to perform variable selection and parameter estimation simultaneously. Consistency, asymptotic normality, and sparsity of the MM bridge regression estimator ar...",2016,Statistics
Detection of seepages in flood embankments using the ElasticNET method,"The presented article discusses the proposition of using an algorithm based on the ElasticNET method to obtain accurate and reproducible results of reconstruction of tomographic images. In particular, the research concerned solving of the inverse problem in electrical tomography with reference to levees and dams. To enable the reconstruction of high resolution images using the impedance tomography, the ElasticNET algorithm was used, which is a combination of two methods: dorsal regression and LASSO. The results of the research have shown that thanks to the ElasticNET method you can obtain high resolution images that are faithful representation of the cross-section of the dam. Streszczenie.

The Sparse MinMax k-means Algorithm for High-Dimensional Data Clustering,"We consider the problem of clustering observations Xi âˆˆ R, i = 1, 2, ...n into K possible clusters. We are mainly interested in the modern regime of p >> n, i.e., when we have a potentially large set of features compared to the number of observations, and where classical clustering methods face challenges. In the framework of sparse clustering that uses lasso-type penalty to adaptively select the best features for clustering, we propose the method of Sparse MinMax kMeans Clustering. We use the MinMax k-Means Clustering algorithm, that assigns weights to the clusters relative to their variance and optimizes a weighted version of the k-Means objective. The Influential Features PCA (IF-PCA) method selects features based on largest Kolmogorov-Smirnov(KS) scores and has been able to obtain good results on high-dimensional gene microarray data sets. The method suggested by us has out performed this IF-PCA method and also the general Sparse k-Means method.",2018,
Madagascarâ€™s wildfowl (Anatidae) in the new millennium,"Ten wildfowl taxa are resident in Madagascar including four endemics: Madagascar White-backed Duck Thalassornis leuconotus insularis, Madagascar Teal Anas bernieri, Mellerâ€™s Duck A. melleri and Madagascar Pochard Aythya innotata. These endemic duck taxa were amongst the last wildfowl forms to be described in Africa and are undoubtedly currently the rarest in this region. The history of our knowledge of these birds follows four easily definable stages: discovery, understanding, protection and the future. The new millennium has started with a much more detailed understanding of the four ducksâ€™ ecology than ever before, the protection of several key sites and the re-discovery in 2006 of the Madagascar Pochard. The next few years will tell if the ducks have a more secure future and, while not yet safe, Madagascarâ€™s ducks are perhaps now among the better known of Africaâ€™s endemic wildfowl.",2013,
Using Intelligent Methods and Optimization of the Existing Empirical Correlations for Iranian Dead Oil Viscosity,"Numerous empirical correlations exist for the estimation of crude oil viscosities. Most of these correlations are not based on the experimental and field data from Iranian geological zone. In this study several well-known empirical correlations including Beal, Beggs, Glasso, Labedi, Schmidt, Alikhan and Naseri were optimized and refitted with the Iranian oil field data. The results showed that the Beal and the Labedi methods were not suitable for estimation of the viscosity of the Iranian crudes, while the Beggs, Glasso and Schmidt methods gave reasonable results. The Naseriâ€™s correlation and their present method proved to be the best classical methods investigated in this study. Two new intelligent methods to predict the viscosity of Iranian crudes have also been introduced. The study also showed that the neural network and SVM give much better results comparing to classical correlations. It is claimed that this study may provide more exact results for the prediction of Iranian oil viscosity.",2017,Journal of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering
Covariance matrix estimation and variable selection in high dimension,"Author(s): Cai, Mu | Advisor(s): Bickel, Peter J | Abstract: First part of the thesis focuses on sparse covariance matrices estimation under the scenario of large dimension p and small sample size n. In particular, we consider a class of covariance matrices which are approximately block diagonal under unknown permutations. We propose a block recovery estimator and show it achieves minimax optimal convergence rate for the class, which is the same as if the permutation were known. The problem is also related to sparse PCA and k-densest subgraphs, where the spike model is a special case of their intersection. Simulations of the spike model and multiple block model, together with a real world application, confirm that the proposed estimator is both statistically and computationally efficient.Second part of the thesis focuses on variable selection in linear regression, also under the high dimensional scenario of large p and small n. We propose a general framework to search variables based on their covariance structures, with a specific variable selection algorithm called kForward which iteratively fits local/small linear models among relatively highly correlated variables. For simulation experiments and a real world data set, we compare kForward to other popular methods including the Lasso, Elastic Net, SCAD, MC+, FoBa for both variable selection and prediction.",2013,
Least Absolute Shrinkage is Equivalent to Quadratic Penalization,"Adaptive ridge is a special form of ridge regression, balancing the quadratic penalization on each parameter of the model. This paper shows the equivalence between adaptive ridge and lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). This equivalence states that both procedures produce the same estimate. Least absolute shrinkage can thus be viewed as a particular quadratic penalization.",1998,
Spectral Characterization of the Multi-Seasonal Component of the Italian Electric Load: A LASSO-FFT Approach,"In this letter, the modeling of the multi-seasonal component of the national electric load is investigated. Differently from additive models that consider just the sum of daily, weekly, and yearly periodic components, in order to account for possible interaction terms a full parametrization in the frequency domain is considered. In the case of quarter-hourly data, almost 1 million parameters are needed to specify the model, which motivates the development of efficient learning techniques capable of enforcing sparsity in the parameter space. For this purpose, a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator with Fast Fourier Transform (LASSO-FFT) algorithm is devised, having $O{(}n\log {(}n{))}$ complexity. Applied to Italian load data, the LASSO-FFT algorithm yields one-year ahead forecasts whose Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), is close to one-day ahead predictors currently used by the Italian transmission system operator.",2020,IEEE Control Systems Letters
Manifold elastic net: a unified framework for sparse dimension reduction,"It is difficult to find the optimal sparse solution of a manifold learning based dimensionality reduction algorithm. The lasso or the elastic net penalized manifold learning based dimensionality reduction is not directly a lasso penalized least square problem and thus the least angle regression (LARS) (Efron etÂ al., Ann Stat 32(2):407â€“499, 2004), one of the most popular algorithms in sparse learning, cannot be applied. Therefore, most current approaches take indirect ways or have strict settings, which can be inconvenient for applications. In this paper, we proposed the manifold elastic net or MEN for short. MEN incorporates the merits of both the manifold learning based dimensionality reduction and the sparse learning based dimensionality reduction. By using a series of equivalent transformations, we show MEN is equivalent to the lasso penalized least square problem and thus LARS is adopted to obtain the optimal sparse solution of MEN. In particular, MEN has the following advantages for subsequent classification: (1) the local geometry of samples is well preserved for low dimensional data representation, (2) both the margin maximization and the classification error minimization are considered for sparse projection calculation, (3) the projection matrix of MEN improves the parsimony in computation, (4) the elastic net penalty reduces the over-fitting problem, and (5) the projection matrix of MEN can be interpreted psychologically and physiologically. Experimental evidence on face recognition over various popular datasets suggests that MEN is superior to top level dimensionality reduction algorithms.",2010,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery
