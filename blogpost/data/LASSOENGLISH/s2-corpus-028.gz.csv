Temporal Matrix Factorization for Tracking Concept Drift in Individual User Preferences,"The matrix factorization (MF) technique has been widely adopted for solving the rating prediction problem in recommender systems. The MF technique utilizes the latent factor model to obtain static user preferences (user latent vectors) and item characteristics (item latent vectors) based on historical rating data. However, in the real world, user preferences are not static but full of dynamics. Though there are several previous works that addressed this time-varying issue of user preferences, it seems (to the best of our knowledge) that none of them are specifically designed for tracking concept drift in individual user preferences. Motivated by this, we develop a temporal MF approach for tracking concept drift in each individual user latent vector. There are two key innovative steps in our approach: 1) we develop a modified stochastic gradient descent method to learn an individual user latent vector at each time step and 2) by Lasso regression, we learn a linear model for the transition of the individual user latent vectors. We test our method on a synthetic data set and several real data sets. In comparison with the original MF, our experimental results show that our temporal method is able to achieve lower root mean square errors (RMSEs) for both the synthetic and real data sets. One interesting finding is that the performance gain in RMSE is mostly from those users who indeed have concept drift in their user latent vectors at the time of prediction. In particular, for the synthetic data set and the Ciao data set, there are quite a few users with that property and the performance gains for these two data sets are roughly 20% and 5%, respectively.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems
Efficient Feature Selection in the Presence of Multiple Feature Classes,"We present an information theoretic approach to feature selection when the data possesses feature classes. Feature classes are pervasive in real data. For example, in gene expression data, the genes which serve as features may be divided into classes based on their membership in gene families or pathways. When doing word sense disambiguation or named entity extraction, features fall into classes including adjacent words, their parts of speech, and the topic and venue of the document the word is in. When predictive features occur predominantly in a small number of feature classes, our information theoretic approach significantly improves feature selection. Experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate substantial improvement in predictive accuracy over the standard L0 penalty-based stepwise and stream wise feature selection methods as well as over Lasso and Elastic Nets, all of which are oblivious to the existence of feature classes.",2008,2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining
Shrinkage estimation strategy in quasi-likelihood models,"In this paper we consider the estimation problem for the quasi-likelihood model in presence of non-sample information (NSI). More specifically, we introduce a shrinkage estimation strategy for simultaneous model selection and parameter estimation by using the maximum quasi-likelihood estimates as the benchmark estimator, and define the pretest estimator (PTE), shrinkage estimator (SE) and positive-rule shrinkage estimator (PSE). Furthermore, we apply the lasso-type estimation strategy and compare the relative performance of lasso with the suggested estimators. The shrinkage estimators are shown to be efficient estimators compared to others. When the NSI is true the PTE has less risk compared to shrinkage and lasso estimators.",2012,Statistics & Probability Letters
An Evaluation of the PrediXcan Method for the Identification of Lipid Associated Genes,"PrediXcan, an imputed gene expression-trait association method, was compared to multiple linear regressions (MLR) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the quantitative phenotypes serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and triglycerides (TG). The gene expression prediction models were trained using transcriptomeand genome-wide data from Depression Genes and Networks (DGN whole blood) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project (GTEx whole blood, GTEx pancreas and GTEx liver). Linear combinations of the effect sizes derived using elastic net or least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with genotypes from 1304 European patients from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) were used to estimate the genetically regulated expression (GReX) for genes. Different gene expression predictors were present in each training set. The 10-fold cross-validated predictive performance, estimated GReX, and p values from associations for matched genes were weakly correlated across training sets and strongly correlated for models derived using elastic net and LASSO. MLR models had more significant associations than PrediXcan models and larger inflation factors for p values. A comparison of p values for matched genes between PrediXcan and MLR models showed weak correlations but strong evidence for LDL and HDL associations with genes at locus 1p13.3 and 16q13, respectively.",2018,
Measurement error correction in the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model when validation data are available,"Measurement of serum biomarkers by multiplex assays may be more variable as compared to single biomarker assays. Measurement error in these data may bias parameter estimates in regression analysis, which could mask true associations of serum biomarkers with an outcome. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) can be used for variable selection in these high-dimensional data. Furthermore, when the distribution of measurement error is assumed to be known or estimated with replication data, a simple measurement error correction method can be applied to the LASSO method. However, in practice the distribution of the measurement error is unknown and is expensive to estimate through replication both in monetary cost and need for greater amount of sample which is often limited in quantity. We adapt an existing bias correction approach by estimating the measurement error using validation data in which a subset of serum biomarkers are re-measured on a random subset of the study sample. We evaluate this method using simulated data and data from the Tucson Epidemiological Study of Airway Obstructive Disease (TESAOD). We show that the bias in parameter estimation is reduced and variable selection is improved.",2019,Statistical Methods in Medical Research
Are headaches different from other chronic pains?,"Dear Editor,Readingtheeditorialâ€˜â€˜Timetoactonheadachedisordersâ€™â€™[1]begs me as an oral physician [(medical and dentally trained,running an orofacial pain service, member of InternationalAssociation for the Study of Pain (IASP) and InternationalHeadache Society (IHS)] to ask a few questions.Why are headaches a separate entity from other chronicpain? What are the boundaries for the head? How do pro-fessionals look at them? How do patients interpret them? Theoral cavity and structures of the lower part of the face remainto a large extent the domain of the dental profession. Medicalstudents rarely have training in this ï¬eld [2]. One needs onlyto compare the criteria for diagnosis of temporomandibulardisorders (TMD) in the classiï¬cations of IASP and IHS tothose of the TMD Research Diagnostic Criteria, to see vastdifferences [3]. Where do these disorders ï¬t?The speciality of pain medicine is relatively young,IASP was founded in 1973 and IHS in 1981 with verysimilar aims but to include conditions of the head and neckonly. The former is truly multidisciplinary IHS is nearlyexclusively the domain of neurologists.The co-morbidities such as depression and anxiety arethe same for all chronic pain patients. TMD pain has beenshown through case control studies to be linked withmigraine, back pain, ï¬bromyalgia and is an example ofcentral sensitisation [4]. Pain management, therefore, needsinput from a wide variety of specialties including anaes-thesia, neurology, rheumatology, neurosurgery, orthopae-dics, dentistry through to liaison psychiatry, physicaltherapy, psychology, occupational therapy. This need formultidisciplinary team (MDT) approach has resulted in painmanagement programs which have been shown throughsystematic reviews to be valuable. Yet in the headache ï¬eldGaul et al.

What is so special about the Ordovician ?,"Some of the most distinctive features of the Ordavieian Period appear to have been (l) an extreme thalassocratic distribution of the land and sea, with associaÂ­ ted extensive development of epieontinental earborrate sediments, (2) profound changes in the eomposition of skeleton-bearing faunas during the Period because of the appearance or diversification of numerous major taxonornie groups, and (3) a pronounced biogeographical differentiation.

"Reef Fish Community Biomass and Trophic Structure Changes across Shallow to Upper-Mesophotic Reefs in the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, Caribbean","Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs; reefs 30-150m depth) are of increased research interest because of their potential role as depth refuges from many shallow reef threats. Yet few studies have identified patterns in fish species composition and trophic group structure between MCEs and their shallow counterparts. Here we explore reef fish species and biomass distributions across shallow to upper-MCE Caribbean reef gradients (5-40m) around Utila, Honduras, using a diver-operated stereo-video system. Broadly, we found reef fish species richness, abundance and biomass declining with depth. At the trophic group level we identified declines in herbivores (both total and relative community biomass) with depth, mostly driven by declines in parrotfish (Scaridae). Piscivores increased as a proportion of the community with increased depth while, in contrast to previous studies, we found no change in relative planktivorous reef fish biomass across the depth gradient. In addition, we also found evidence of ontogenetic migrations in the blue tang (Acanthurus coeruleus), striped parrotfish (Scarus iserti), blue chromis (Chromis cyanea), creole wrasse (Clepticus parrae), bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) and yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus), with a higher proportion of larger individuals at mesophotic and near-mesophotic depths than on shallow reefs. Our results highlight the importance of using biomass measures when considering fish community changes across depth gradients, with biomass generating different results to simple abundance counts.",2016,PLoS ONE
Comparison of analyses of the XVth QTLMAS common dataset III: Genomic Estimations of Breeding Values,"BackgroundThe QTLMAS XVth dataset consisted of pedigree, marker genotypes and quantitative trait performances of animals with a sib family structure. Pedigree and genotypes concerned 3,000 progenies among those 2,000 were phenotyped. The trait was regulated by 8 QTLs which displayed additive, imprinting or epistatic effects. The 1,000 unphenotyped progenies were considered as candidates to selection and their Genomic Estimated Breeding Values (GEBV) were evaluated by participants of the XVth QTLMAS workshop. This paper aims at comparing the GEBV estimation results obtained by seven participants to the workshop.MethodsFrom the known QTL genotypes of each candidate, two ""true"" genomic values (TV) were estimated by organizers: the genotypic value of the candidate (TGV) and the expectation of its progeny genotypic values (TBV). GEBV were computed by the participants following different statistical methods: random linear models (including BLUP and Ridge Regression), selection variable techniques (LASSO, Elastic Net) and Bayesian methods. Accuracy was evaluated by the correlation between TV (TGV or TBV) and GEBV presented by participants. Rank correlation of the best 10% of individuals and error in predictions were also evaluated. Bias was tested by regression of TV on GEBV.ResultsLarge differences between methods were found for all criteria and type of genetic values (TGV, TBV). In general, the criteria ranked consistently methods belonging to the same family.ConclusionsBayesian methods - A<B<C<CÏ€ - were the most efficient whatever the criteria and the True Value considered (with the notable exception of the MSEP of the TBV). The selection variable procedures (LASSO, Elastic Net and some adaptations) performed similarly, probably at a much lower computing cost. The TABLUP, which combines BayesB and GBLUP, generally did well. The simplest methods, GBLUP or Ridge Regression, and even worst, the fixed linear model, were much less efficient.",2012,BMC Proceedings
The linkage disequilibrium lasso for SNP selection in genetic association studies,"by SAMUEL G. YOUNKIN A rapid increase in the number of human genetic variants available for study has led genetic epidemiologists to an agnostic approach to disease-gene mapping. In recent years the field has been dominated by the genome-wide association study in which the entire genome is interrogated for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) responsible for disease. This method has resulted in the identification of only a small portion of the expected disease susceptibility sites, and it is our belief that many of the remaining SNPs contribute such a small amount to overall heritability that studies of this type cannot overcome the inherent difficulties that arise from the vast amount of multiple testing associated with the agnostic approach. Here we develop a statistical method designed for a genetic association signal that is more representative of the remaining disease susceptibility SNPs. The genetic association signal that we seek is no longer a peak, because the increase in SNP density, coupled with low effect sizes give rise to a plateau-like signal with gaps. We address this by formulating our method as a penalized least squares regression estimator based on the linkage disequilibrium present between SNPs in the same haplotype block. The method which we call the LD LASSO is an adaptation of the fused LASSO used for subset selection in a regression framework when the signal is sparse and block-like. We implement this method in the R package ldlasso, and make it available to all. We demonstrate the use of the method by examining six regions on chromosome 8 suspected to contain variants associated with Late Onset Alzheimerâ€™s Disease.",2011,

Bayesian composite quantile regression,"One advantage of quantile regression, relative to the ordinary least-square (OLS) regression, is that the quantile regression estimates are more robust against outliers and non-normal errors in the response measurements. However, the relative efficiency of the quantile regression estimator with respect to the OLS estimator can be arbitrarily small. To overcome this problem, composite quantile regression methods have been proposed in the literature which are resistant to heavy-tailed errors or outliers in the response and at the same time are more efficient than the traditional single quantile-based quantile regression method. This paper studies the composite quantile regression from a Bayesian perspective. The advantage of the Bayesian hierarchical framework is that the weight of each component in the composite model can be treated as open parameter and automatically estimated through Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling procedure. Moreover, the lasso regularization can be naturally incorporated into the model to perform variable selection. The performance of the proposed method over the single quantile-based method was demonstrated via extensive simulations and real data analysis.",2015,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
"Patterns of pisciviory by resident predatory reef fish at One Tree Reef, Great Barrier Reef","Patterns of piscivory were investigated among five abundant species of predatory fish at One Tree Reef, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The guts of two lutjanids Lutjanus carponotatus and Lutjanus fulviflamma, two labrids Cheilinus diagrammus and Thalassoma lunare, and a serranid Epinephelus quoyanus were examined for type, length, number and volume of prey at two times of the day: sunrise and sunset. Each of these species consumed fish, but only T. lunare and the two lutjanids consumed recruit-sized fish. This information is important because there is often scepticism as to whether large predators (>200 mm TL) such as lutjanids consume new recruits. Only in the lutjanids were there differences in the number and volume of prey present in the gut at sunrise and at sunset; at sunset, few lutjanid specimens contained prey, whereas at sunrise 98% of specimens contained prey. This result, in conjunction with studies of nocturnal activity, suggest that patterns of predation pressure inferred from daylight observations of predator abundance may have little relevance to actual patterns of predation at local scales.",1998,Marine and Freshwater Research

Variable selection for model-based clustering using the integrated complete-data likelihood,"Variable selection in cluster analysis is important yet challenging. It can be achieved by regularization methods, which realize a trade-off between the clustering accuracy and the number of selected variables by using a lasso-type penalty. However, the calibration of the penalty term can suffer from criticisms. Model selection methods are an efficient alternative, yet they require a difficult optimization of an information criterion which involves combinatorial problems. First, most of these optimization algorithms are based on a suboptimal procedure (e.g. stepwise method). Second, the algorithms are often computationally expensive because they need multiple calls of EM algorithms. Here we propose to use a new information criterion based on the integrated complete-data likelihood. It does not require the maximum likelihood estimate and its maximization appears to be simple and computationally efficient. The original contribution of our approach is to perform the model selection without requiring any parameter estimation. Then, parameter inference is needed only for the unique selected model. This approach is used for the variable selection of a Gaussian mixture model with conditional independence assumed. The numerical experiments on simulated and benchmark datasets show that the proposed method often outperforms two classical approaches for variable selection. The proposed approach is implemented in the R package VarSelLCM available on CRAN.",2017,Statistics and Computing

Simultaneous Clustering and Estimation of Heterogeneous Graphical Models,"We consider joint estimation of multiple graphical models arising from heterogeneous and high-dimensional observations. Unlike most previous approaches which assume that the cluster structure is given in advance, an appealing feature of our method is to learn cluster structure while estimating heterogeneous graphical models. This is achieved via a high dimensional version of Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm (Meng and Rubin, 1993). A joint graphical lasso penalty is imposed on the conditional maximization step to extract both homogeneity and heterogeneity components across all clusters. Our algorithm is computationally efficient due to fast sparse learning routines and can be implemented without unsupervised learning knowledge. The superior performance of our method is demonstrated by extensive experiments and its application to a Glioblastoma cancer dataset reveals some new insights in understanding the Glioblastoma cancer. In theory, a non-asymptotic error bound is established for the output directly from our high dimensional ECM algorithm, and it consists of two quantities: statistical error (statistical accuracy) and optimization error (computational complexity). Such a result gives a theoretical guideline in terminating our ECM iterations.",2017,Journal of machine learning research : JMLR
TH-AB-304-07: A Two-Stage Signature-Based Data Fusion Mechanism to Predict Radiation Pneumonitis in Patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"Purpose: For NSCLC radiotherapy, toxicity outcomes such as radiation pneumonitis â‰¥G2 (RP2) may depend on patientsâ€™ physical, clinical, biological and genomic characteristics, and on biomarkers measured during the course of radiotherapy. This can include 100s of predictors. To reduce complexity, a two-step, signature-based data fusion mechanism was developed to estimate a relationship between patient specific characteristics and the probability of RP2 in terms of a modifying effect on mean lung dose (MLD). Methods: Data came from 82 NSCLC patients, 15 with RP2. Besides MLD, each had 179 predictors including 10 clinical factors (eg, age, gender, KPS), cytokines before (30) and during (30) treatment, microRNAs (49), and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (60). In stage1, cytokines, microRNAs, and SNPs were used to build separate â€œsignaturesâ€ via ridge regression. In stage2, a logistic regression predictive model for RP2 was determined in terms of MLD, the other clinical factors, and the signatures using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Leave-one-out cross-validation was conducted. This was all implemented via â€˜glmnetâ€™ in the R programming environment. Results: For stage1, signatures modifying the effect of MLD for cytokine_pre, cytokine_during, microRNA and SNP included 2, 19, 3, 12 important predictors, respectively. For stage2, only the cytokine_during and SNP signatures remained as important modifying effects to MLD. The cross-validated area under curve (AUC) reaches 0.81 (95% CI 0.70â€“0.89 based on 2000 stratified bootstrap replicates); significantly better than a null value of 0.50 (p<0.01). Conclusions: As implemented here, the two-stage, signature-based data fusion mechanism approach includes many patient specific measurements in generation of the signatures (a characteristic of ridge regression), then only includes important signatures and other clinical factors for RP2 prediction (a characteristic of LASSO). This potentially more intuitive approach to handling high dimensional predictors could be an important component of decision support for personalized adaptive radiation treatment.",2015,Medical Physics
Restricted Eigenvalue Properties for Correlated Gaussian Designs,"Methods based on l1-relaxation, such as basis pursuit and the Lasso, are very popular for sparse regression in high dimensions. The conditions for success of these methods are now well-understood: (1) exact recovery in the noiseless setting is possible if and only if the design matrix X satisfies the restricted nullspace property, and (2) the squared l2-error of a Lasso estimate decays at the minimax optimal rate k log p / n, where k is the sparsity of the p-dimensional regression problem with additive Gaussian noise, whenever the design satisfies a restricted eigenvalue condition. The key issue is thus to determine when the design matrix X satisfies these desirable properties. Thus far, there have been numerous results showing that the restricted isometry property, which implies both the restricted nullspace and eigenvalue conditions, is satisfied when all entries of X are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), or the rows are unitary. This paper proves directly that the restricted nullspace and eigenvalue conditions hold with high probability for quite general classes of Gaussian matrices for which the predictors may be highly dependent, and hence restricted isometry conditions can be violated with high probability. In this way, our results extend the attractive theoretical guarantees on l1-relaxations to a much broader class of problems than the case of completely independent or unitary designs.",2010,J. Mach.

State of the art of the free-living marine Monhysteridae (Nematoda),"The family Monhysteridae is characterized by 17 valid genera, seven of which are known to be free-living, inhabiting marine sediments. In total, 70 valid marine species are ascribed to these seven genera. Overall, the family is characterized by a confused taxonomic history with a large list of synonyms and species inquirendae. The taxonomic problem is not restricted to the old literature, but inconsistencies also appeared in recent studies. The aim of this study is to show the most important diagnostic characters to identify each genus and provide taxonomic tools for species identification. Dichotomous-keys and illustration-guides are attempted for the marine monhysterid species. For the family and each subfamily, tribe and marine genus a brief historical background, diagnosis and a list of valid species is provided. Hereby, we propose to transfer eight species of the genus Thalassomonhystera to the genus Monhystrella.",2008,
Investigation of epizootic papillomatosis in bluegill Lepomis macrochirus (Rafinesque 1810) using next-generation sequencing.,"Orocutaneous neoplasms in fish have been recognized for over a century (Mawdesley-Thomas 1975). Most are benign epidermal hyperplasias and papillomas, with rare squamous cell carcinomas (Groff 2004; Roberts 2012). In the brown bullhead Ameiurus nebulosus (Lesueur), evidence suggests a possible chemical aetiology (Grizzle, Melius & Strength 1984; Pinkney, Harshbarger & Rutter 2014), while virus or virus-like particles have been demonstrated in other species (Coffee, Casey & Bowser 2013). Some sources relate tumour development to potential interactions between environmental contaminants and viruses (Smith, Ferguson & Hayes 1989). Several tumour-associated virus particles have been tentatively identified based on morphology only, including herpesviruses, retroviruses, adenoviruses and others (Anders & Yoshimizu 1994; Coffee et al. 2013). Examples of herpesviral-induced neoplastic conditions include salmonid herpesvirus II and cyprinid herpesvirus I, both of which cause mortalities in young fish and papillomas in some older survivors (Kimura & Yoshimizu 1989; Sano et al. 1991). The genus Epsilonretrovirus contains the complex retroviruses that infect fish (Edien et al. 2010; Goff 2013), several of which have been partially or completely sequenced (Bowser & Casey 1993; Holzschu et al. 1995; Basta et al. 2009; Coffee et al. 2013). The pathology of retroviralassociated tumours in fish has been reviewed by Coffee et al. 2013. While some associations are well supported by sequence data and transmission trials, others are based entirely on electron microscopy and the detection of reverse transcriptase activity. Epithelial hyperplasia, papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas on the skin, fins and lips of bluegill displayed at a public aquarium and from a private pond prompted investigation of a suspected viral aetiology using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Advanced molecular techniques, such as NGS and in situ hybridization, have made it possible to establish more definitive relationships between viruses and neoplasia. Potentially confounding investigations of suspected tumorigenic retroviruses are the presence of fragmented, partial or complete retroviral genomes, representing previous, often ancient, integrations into host germ lines. Endogenous viral element (EVE) is a term used for such endogenous viruses and fragments (Holmes 2011). Retroviruses are common sources of EVEs, as host genome integration is essential to their replication Correspondence A C Camus, Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, 501 DW Brooks, Drive, Athens, GA 30602, USA (e-mail: camus@uga.edu)",2017,Journal of fish diseases
Efficacy of Using Radio Transmitters to Monitor Least Tern Chicks,"Abstract Little is known about Least Tern (Sterna antillarum) chicks from the time they leave the nest until fledging because they are highly mobile and cryptically colored. We evaluated the efficacy of using radio-telemetry to monitor Interior Least Tern (S. a. athalassos) chicks at Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge, Oklahoma. In 1999, we attached radio transmitters to 26 Least Tern chicks and tracked them for 2â€“17 days. No adults abandoned their chicks after transmitters were attached. Transmitters did not appear to alter growth rates of transmittered chicks (P = 0.36) or prevent feather growth, although dermal irritation was observed on one chick. However, without frequent reattachment, transmitters generally did not remain on chicks <1 week old for more than 2 days because of feather growth and transmitter removal, presumably by adult terns. Although the presence of transmitters did not adversely affect Least Tern chicks, future assessments should investigate nonintrusive methods to improve retention of transmitters on young chicks and reduce the number of times that chicks need to be handled.",2005,
Katyusha: Accelerated Variance Reduction for Faster SGD,"We consider minimizing f(x) that is an average of n convex, smooth functions fi(x), and provide the first direct stochastic gradient method Katyusha that has the accelerated convergence rate. It converges to an Îµ-approximate minimizer using O((n + âˆš nÎº) Â· log f(x0)âˆ’f(x âˆ—) Îµ ) stochastic gradients where Îº is the condition number. Katyusha is a primal-only method, supporting proximal updates, non-Euclidean norm smoothness, mini-batch sampling, as well as non-uniform sampling. It also resolves the following open questions in machine learning â€¢ If f(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., Lasso, logistic regression), Katyusha gives the first stochastic method that achieves the optimal 1/ âˆš Îµ rate. â€¢ If f(x) is strongly convex and each fi(x) is â€œrank-oneâ€ (e.g., SVM), Katyusha gives the first stochastic method that achieves the optimal 1/ âˆš Îµ rate. â€¢ If f(x) is not strongly convex and each fi(x) is â€œrank-oneâ€ (e.g., L1SVM), Katyusha gives the first stochastic method that achieves the optimal 1/Îµ rate. The main ingredient in Katyusha is a novel â€œnegative momentum on top of momentumâ€ that can be elegantly coupled with the existing variance reduction trick for stochastic gradient descent. As a result, since variance reduction has been successfully applied to fast growing list of practical problems, our paper implies that one had better hurry up and give Katyusha a hug in each of them, in hoping for a faster running time also in practice.",2016,ArXiv
A bias-variance based heuristic for constructing a hybrid logistic regression-naÃ¯ve Bayes model for classification,"Abstract Discriminative classifiers tend to have lower asymptotic classification errors, while generative classifiers can be more accurate when the training set size is small. In this paper, we examine the construction of hybrid models from categorical data, where we use logistic regression (LR) as a discriminative component, and naive Bayes (NB) as a generative component. We adopt a bias-variance tradeoff based strategy, with the objective of minimizing the sum of these two errors. Specifically, the proposed heuristic consists of functions of training sample size and conditional dependence among features. These functions serve as proxies for model variance and model bias. We implement our method on 25 different classification datasets, and find that the hybrid model does better than pure LR and pure NB. Our proposed method is competitive with random forest. Although the hybrid model fails to beat LASSO in predictive performance, as suggested by the experimental results, the difference appears to be insignificant when the number of features is small. Also, the hybrid model requires less training time than LASSO, which makes it more attractive when the training time is a big concern.",2020,Int. J. Approx. Reason.
Proximal Algorithms in Statistics and Machine Learning,"In this paper we develop proximal methods for statistical learning. Proximal point algorithms are useful in statistics and machine learning for obtaining optimization solutions for composite functions. Our approach exploits closed-form solutions of proximal operators and envelope representations based on the Moreau, Forward-Backward, Douglas-Rachford and Half-Quadratic envelopes. Envelope representations lead to novel proximal algorithms for statistical optimisation of composite objective functions which include both non-smooth and non-convex objectives. We illustrate our methodology with regularized Logistic and Poisson regression and non-convex bridge penalties with a fused lasso norm. We provide a discussion of convergence of non-descent algorithms with acceleration and for non-convex functions. Finally, we provide directions for future research.",2015,ArXiv
Linear Regression Modelling on Epigallocatechin-3-gallate Sensor Data for Green Tea,"In this paper, linear regression machine learning techniques are applied to determine the quality of green tea samples. The data set is obtained by applying Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) on green tea samples using Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specific sensor based on Molecular Imprinted Polymer (MIP) technique. Multiple linear regression models have been developed using this dataset that gives more hidden insight of the dataset and helps to find the input feature importance out of it. Regularization techniques are applied on linear regression like Ridge regression (L2 Penalty), Lasso regression (L1 Penalty) and ElasticNet regression (combination of L1 and L2 Penalty) considered to reduce overfitting of the model and to provide better prediction. The variation of cross validation score vs regularization parameter for different regularized techniques of linear regression are also taken under consideration and best value of the regularization parameter is calculated to develop the model for getting better prediction with high accuracy. From the result obtained from model metrics, a clear picture is portrayed how lasso regression performs better than ridge regression for this dataset and eliminates the less important features to develop the model as sparsity can be useful in practice if we have a high dimensional dataset with many features that are not effective for modelling. The beauty of ElasticNet Regression model is also highlighted how both L1 and L2 penalty go hand in hand to give prediction at a high accuracy.",2018,2018 Fourth International Conference on Research in Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (ICRCICN)
"Continuous selection theorem, coincidence theorem and intersection theorems concerning sets with H -convex sections","A continuous selection and a coincidence theorem are proved in H -spaces which generalize the corresponding results of Ben-El-Mechaiekh-Deguire-Granas, Browder, Ko-Tan, Lassonde, Park, Simon and Takahashi to noncompact and/or nonconvex settings. By applying the two theorems, some intersection theorems concerning sets with H -convex sections are obtained which generalize the corresponding results of Fan, Lassonde and Shih-Tan to H -spaces. Some applications to minimax principle are given.",1992,Journal of The Australian Mathematical Society
"Paleocene Palynoflora from Upper Member of Yuyang Formation,jianghan Basin of Central China","The type section of the Paomagang Formation is located at Dangyang in the western part of the Jianghan Basin, Central China. Geological age of the Paomagang Formation was assigned to Late Cretaceous by most palaeontologists based on their palaeontological studies. According to his detailed study on the charophyte fossils from the type section, Li (1985; 1998) suggests a Paleocene age for the greater part of the Paomagang Formation and believes the Paomagang section of the Jianghan Basin spans the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. Pollen fossils are the key stratigraphic tool in defining the terrestrial Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary in North America. Up to date few fossil pollen grains were obtained from the type section of the formation. The Upper Member of Yuyang Formation is the contemporaneous subsurface sediments of the Paomagang Formation. Its geological age is considered as the same as that of the Paomagang Formation. To ascertain the potential Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary in the basin we processed some drilling core samples for pollen from the Upper Member of the Yuyang Formation. Most of the processed samples do not contain significant amount of fossils except those from Well Qu 3 at the Qujiawan area of the basin.The fossil pollen flora from Well Qu 3 favours Li's argument of potential Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary in the Jianghan Basin. The palynoflora obtained from the Upper Member of the Yuyang Formation is dominated by angiosperm pollen, amounting to about 80% of the total. Gymnosperm pollen occupies some 14% of the total. Ephedripites constitutes the main body of the gymnosperm pollen. Percentage of spores is low (6%), about half of which is Pteridaceoisporites. The palynoflora contains abundant Quercoidites, Ulmoideipites, Salixipollenites, Rhoipites, Sapindaceidites, Nanlingpollis, Rutaceoipollis, Pentapollenites, Tricolporopollenites, with very a few of Cretaceous pollen types. Comparing the pollen sequences of the Jianghan Basin (Wang and Zhao, 1980b) and Sanshui Basin of Guangdong (Song et al., 1986), the present pollen palynoflora bears much more resemblance to the Early Paleogene assemblages, rather than the Late Cretaceous ones. On the other hand, many common members of this pollen flora, e. g. Nanlingpollis, Pentapollenites, Rutaceoipollis, Quercoidites microhenrici, Q. henrici frequently appear in the Paleogene, especially Paleocene pollen floras of southern China. While those Cretaceous types of South and Central China are individual or absent, i. e. Classopollis, Sapindaceidites projectus, Schizaeoisporites, Rugu- bivesiculites , Callistopollenites, Jianghanpollis, Cranwellia, Morinoipollenites, Consoliduspollenites. Therefore, this palynoflora probably belongs to Paleocene in geological age. In other words, the Upper Member of Yuyang Formation probably spans the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary and contains some Paleocene sediments in its upper part.",2006,
High-Dimensional Joint Estimation of Multiple Directed Gaussian Graphical Models,"We consider the problem of jointly estimating multiple related directed acyclic graph (DAG) models based on high-dimensional data from each graph. This problem is motivated by the task of learning gene regulatory networks based on gene expression data from different tissues, developmental stages or disease states. We prove that under certain regularity conditions, the proposed $\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimator converges in Frobenius norm to the adjacency matrices consistent with the data-generating distributions and has the correct sparsity. In particular, we show that this joint estimation procedure leads to a faster convergence rate than estimating each DAG model separately. As a corollary we also obtain high-dimensional consistency results for causal inference from a mix of observational and interventional data. For practical purposes, we propose jointGES consisting of Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) to estimate the union of all DAG models followed by variable selection using lasso to obtain the different DAGs, and we analyze its consistency guarantees. The proposed method is illustrated through an analysis of simulated data as well as epithelial ovarian cancer gene expression data.",2018,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Pabon Lasso and Data Envelopment Analysis: A Complementary Approach to Hospital Performance Measurement,"BACKGROUND
Performance measurement is essential to the management of health care organizations to which efficiency is per se a vital indicator. Present study accordingly aims to measure the efficiency of hospitals employing two distinct methods.


METHODS
Data Envelopment Analysis and Pabon Lasso Model were jointly applied to calculate the efficiency of all general hospitals located in Iranian Eastern Azerbijan Province. Data was collected using hospitals' monthly performance forms and analyzed and displayed by MS Visio and DEAP software.


RESULTS
In accord with Pabon Lasso model, 44.5% of the hospitals were entirely efficient, whilst DEA revealed 61% to be efficient. As such, 39% of the hospitals, by the Pabon Lasso, were wholly inefficient; based on DEA though; the relevant figure was only 22.2%. Finally, 16.5% of hospitals as calculated by Pabon Lasso and 16.7% by DEA were relatively efficient. DEA appeared to show more hospitals as efficient as opposed to the Pabon Lasso model.


CONCLUSION
Simultaneous use of two models rendered complementary and corroborative results as both evidently reveal efficient hospitals. However, their results should be compared with prudence. Whilst the Pabon Lasso inefficient zone is fully clear, DEA does not provide such a crystal clear limit for inefficiency.",2014,Global Journal of Health Science
1 Variable Selection in Restricted Linear Regression Models,"The use of prior information in the linear regression is well known to provide more efficient estimators of regression coefficients. The methods of non-stochastic restricted regression estimation proposed by Theil and Goldberger (1961) are preferred when prior information is available. In this study, we will consider parameter estimation and the variable selection in non-stochastic restricted linear regression model, using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method introduced by Tibshirani (1996). A small simulation study and real data example are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed method for dealing with the variable selection and the parameter estimation in restricted linear regression models.",2017,
Predrag MatvejeviÄ‡â€™s : Nostalgia for an â€œEx-Worldâ€ or Breviary for a New Community?,"In recent years, the declining importance of the nation-state and an increase in globalization have encouraged scholars to move towards the borderless world of seas and oceans, giving special attention to their diasporic movements of people and goods. Lately, this â€œnew thalassologyâ€ has witnessed an outburst of Mediterranean studies. Yet the resurgence of the Mediterranean in the postmodern, anti-nationalistic arena must be critically assessed. The risk in such studies is a reinforcing of old stereotypes, what the anthropologist Michael Herzfeld calls â€œMediterraneism.â€ The present article highlights the work of two scholars and one writer who alert us to the manifold dangers of Mediterraneism and who offer standpoints for launching a serious interrogation of Mediterraneism. Roberto Dainotto points to the asymmetries couched in the alluring metaphors of liquidity and flows. Iain Chambers views the Mediterranean as a space of solid borders that entail the production and consumption of the immigrant as outcast. The writer Predrag Matvejevic shows how Mediterranean identity cannot be understood as an all-encompassing unity, but as a satura, a discrete ensemble made up of differences and conflicts. By constructing a metonymical network of landscapes, things and crafts, and relying on the philological excavation of everyday words, his Mediterranean Breviary succeeds in asserting a humble communal identity against the clamor of wars and the retracing of borders.",2010,California Italian studies
Coding and geometrical shapes in nanostructures: A fractal DNA-assembly,"Fractal patterns represent an important classof aperiodic arrangements. Generating fractalstructures by self-assembly is a majorchallenge for nanotechnology. The specificityof DNA sticky-ended interactions and thewell-behaved structural nature of DNAparallelogram motifs has previously led to aprotocol that appears likely to be capable ofproducing fractal constructions [A. Carbone andN.C. Seeman, A route to fractal DNAassembly, Natural Computing1,469â€“480, 2002]. That protocol dependson gluing the set of tiles with special `gluetiles' to produce the fractal structure. It ispossible to develop a fractal-assembly protocolthat does not require the participation ofgluing components. When designed with similarDNA parallelogram motifs, the protocol involvessixteen specific tiles, sixteen closely relatedtiles, and a series of protecting groups thatare designed to be removed by the introductionof specific strands into the solution. Onenovel aspect of the construction on thetheoretical level is the interplay of bothgeometry and coding in tile design. A secondfeature, related to the implementation, is thenotion of generalized protecting groups.",2004,Natural Computing
"Selected Twentieth Century Works for Soprano and Marimba: An Analytic Exploration, Part 2","(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.) INTRODUCTION SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF THE FIRST COMPOSITION for soprano and marimba in 1976, there has been an increasing interest among composers, as well as percussionists and singers, in compositions for this timbral combination. Two works for soprano and marimba-Five Songs for Voice and Marimba by Lynn Glassock, and She sings . . . by Douglas Ovens-were the subject of a recent comprehensive analysis.1 In a two-part article, key features and outcomes of that analysis are presented; this second installment presents those for She sings . . . by Douglas Ovens. First, traditional compositional elements of formal design were identified through observation of sectional changes; textural changes; harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic design; text painting devices; and text setting methods. Timbral variety, created through changing vocalization types and stroke types, was also observed. The second component of the analysis was an exploration of how composers and performers overcome an additional challenge inherent in works for soprano and marimba. Because there are no pedals to assist in sustaining the sound on the marimba, the marimba lacks sustain that is inherent in other instruments such as the piano, organ, and other wind instruments. The pairing of voice and marimba can lead to performance issues when composers do not address the element of sustain through compositional techniques. Methods for how composers and performers overcome these challenges were explored. SHE SINGS . . . DOUGLAS OVENS, COMPOSER E. E. CUMMINGS, POET Douglas Ovens Biography Douglas Ovens was born in Walla Walla, Washington in 1953. He received a bachelor of music degree in theory and composition at San Francisco State University in 1979 and completed both a master of music degree and a doctor of philosophy degree in composition at the University of California in Santa Barbara. Having taught on the faculties of the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of North Carolina, Asheville, Ovens currently is a Professor of Music at Muhlenberg College, where he served as chair of the music department from 1994-2005.2 As a composer, Ovens has written more than sixty works in various media from orchestral pieces to electronic music for dance, which have been performed in both national and international venues. Ovens has received awards from the Percussive Arts Society and the University of California. Additionally, his compositions were selected for performance at the Charles Ives Center for American Music in 1983, 1984, and 1988.3 Ovens self-publishes She sings . . . , obtainable by contacting him at ovens@muhlenberg.edu. E. E. Cummings Biography Edward Estlin Cummings was born in 1894 in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Edward Cummings, a Harvard professor and Unitarian clergyman, and his wife Rebecca. Jenny Penberthy indicates that the childhood of the young Cummings in Cambridge was happy, protected, and homogenous.4 As Cummings developed as a writer, allusions to idyllic childhood recurred throughout his work. In 1917, Cummings first used the lower-case first-person singular pronoun that was to become his trademark. According to Penberthy, Cummings was one of the first modern poets to use typographic eccentricities in his writing.5 Strong visual character in his poetry and his dismemberment of syntax was borrowed from elements of cubism and other contemporary European visual art.6 Interestingly, especially in view of the poet's idiosyncratic style, some reviewers observe that the style of Cummings neither changed nor developed considerably throughout his career.7 Analysis of She sings . . . The cycle She sings . . . contains three songs: ""dominic has,"" ""at just 5a,"" and ""fearlessandbosomy."" Each can be analyzed as a stand-alone piece; however, unifying motivic elements exist among the pieces. Additionally, specific important intervals appear in each. â€¦",2011,Journal of Singing
Observations on parasitism by Thalassomyces fagei on three euphausiid species in Southern-Atlantic waters,"The inhibiting effects of the parasite Thalassomycesfagei (Ellobiopsidae, Dinophyceae) on gonadic development in euphausiids have already been reported by several authors. Such castrative action reaches significant proportions in these crustaceans, which are important components in the diet of many commercially exploited fishes. In the present work, 2641 furciliae, post-larvae and adults of Euphausia lucens, E. vallentini and Thysanoessagregaria were examined. The samples were taken in Southern Atlantic waters by RjV ""Walther Herwing"" and ""Shinkai Maru"" between May 1978 and February 1979. Increasing incidence of parasitism was found at the end of winter and beginning of spring, the most commonly affected species being E. vallentini (9.9% of the total). Some reduction of secondary sexual characters was typically associated, though its extent was not constant. Oceanol. Acta, 1989, 12, 1, 95-97.",1989,Oceanologica Acta
Bayesian regularized quantile regression,"Regularization, e.g. lasso, has been shown to be effective in quantile regression in improving the prediction accuracy (Li and Zhu 2008; Wu and Liu 2009). This paper studies regularization in quantile regressions from a Bayesian perspective. By proposing a hierarchical model framework, we give a generic treatment to a set of regularization approaches, including lasso, group lasso and elastic net penalties. Gibbs samplers are derived for all cases. This is the first work to discuss regularized quantile regression with the group lasso penalty and the elastic net penalty. Both simulated and real data examples show that Bayesian regularized quantile regression methods often outperform quantile regression without regularization and their non-Bayesian counterparts with regularization.",2010,Bayesian Analysis

Metagenomic Predictions of Growth and Carcass Traits in Pigs with the Use of Bayesian Alphabet and Machine Learning Methods.,"C. Maltecca, D. Lu, F. Tiezzi, C. Schillebeeckx, N.P. McNulty, C. Schwab and C. Shull North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA, Matatu Inc., Saint Louis, MO, USA, The Maschhoffs LLC., Carlyle, IL, USA. Summary In this paper, we evaluated the power of metagenome measures taken at three time points over the growth test period (weaning ,15 weeks and 22 weeks) to predict growth and carcass traits in a line of crossbred pigs. Models from the Bayesian alphabet (Bayesian Lasso) as well as two machine learning approaches (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) were employed to predict weight, backfat, loin depth and loin area at week 15 and 22. Prediction accuracy was measured as correlation between true and predicted phenotypes in cross validation. In addition, a time dependent recurrent neural network using all microbiome measures simultaneously was fitted to classify individuals in 4 groups based on daily gain and backfat at week 22. In most cases prediction accuracy increased with the inclusion of microbiome composition. Accuracy was larger with the inclusion of microbiome composition taken at week 15 and 22, with values ranging from ~.30 for loin traits to > .50 for backfat. Model choice only affected prediction accuracy marginally. Microbiome can be used as an effective tool to predict growth and carcass in swine.",2018,

Risk Factors for Early Mortality on Antiretroviral Treatment of Elderly People Infected with HIV in Burkina Faso,"Background: Age is a key determinant of mortality due to diseases including HIV infection. Methods: A retrospective and descriptive cohort study used a computerized database to compare HIV-infected patients diagnosed in late adulthood to a group of patients diagnosed before their 49 years of age, without matching the characteristics of HIV infection. The study included patients who visited the day hospital (outpatient clinic) of the Sanou Souro Teaching Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso, in Burkina Faso, from January 2007 to December 2011. Older adults were defined as those aged 50 years and more. Results: Participants in the study consisted of 2572 patients (265 older adults and 2307 young patients living with HIV. Based on Markov chain method, 32.1% of the older adults living with HIV were found to be seroconvert at 50 years or older. The median follow-up time on antiretroviral treatment (ART) was 32.7 months (range 0.03-65.4 months). Two hundred and ninety-five (11.5%) patients died, including 21.1% of older adults and 10.4% of young (P < .01). World Health Organization stage 3 or 4 and the lowest CD4 count reached <200 cells/mm3 were the factors associated with early mortality of older adults on ART. Conclusion: Mortality rate of older adult patients living with HIV in Burkina Faso is high. Early diagnosis, early treatment, and primary prevention of HIV infection in the older adults are the main keys that could help reduce such mortality.",2015,Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care (JIAPAC)
Stable isotope ratios of Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) and snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea) bone collagen,"This study investigated the trophic hierarchy status of the Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) and snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea) within the Southern Ocean food-web off Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica. During 1991/92 ten Antarctic petrel and ten snow petrel carcasses were collected from Jekselen (71Â°59â€²S, 02Â°35â€²W) and Robertskollen (71Â°28â€²S, 03Â°15â€²W) respectively, in the northern Ahlmannryggen, Dronning Maud Land. Collagen from the dense bone of the humeri of these carcasses was extracted and the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of these samples determined. The snow petrel bone collagen samples displayed a mean Î´13C value of âˆ’23.9Â±0.7 (range: âˆ’24.7 to âˆ’22.9; n=9) and a mean Î´15N value of 15.2Â±1.6 (range: 12.9 to 18.4; n=10). The corresponding values for Antarctic petrel bone collagen were âˆ’24.8Â±1.0 (range: âˆ’26.2 to âˆ’22.8; n=9) and 13.2Â±0.6 (range: 12.5 to 13.9; n=8) respectively. The difference between the speciesâ€™ Î´13C values may indicate differences in their foraging habitat. It has previously been suggested that the snow petrel has a higher wing loading than other Procellariiforme species, making the snow petrel less adapted to pelagic foraging than related species and more likely to forage close to the sea ice edge. Algae growing under sea ice apparently can have comparatively high Î´13C values, possibly due to growing under carbon dioxide limited conditions. If so, animals foraging close to the sea ice edge might be expected to show higher Î´13C values in their body tissues than animals foraging farther out over the open ocean. However, the high Î´13C of snow petrel collagen is possibly more likely to be related to the correspondingly high Î´15N values found in this tissue, and hence caused by snow petrels including offal from high trophic level Antarctic mammals and birds in their diet.",2005,Polar Biology
"DeterminaciÃ³n del Ã­ndice trÃ³fico de la calidad de agua a partir de la presencia de diatomeas epilÃ­ticas en el rÃ­o Cutuchi, sector Lasso, cantÃ³n Latacunga","The research project aims to determine water quality based on the presence of epilitic diatoms in the Cutuchi River, located in the Lasso sector with UTM coordinates,the latitude: 0765609; length: 9912342; altitude: 2941msnm. There are industries near the Cutuchi River NOVACERO, INDULAC, and SAFESA. It presents good quality land suitable for agriculture and cattle raising. Epithelial diatoms are bioindicator microorganisms that allow the determination of water quality. These provide information on the biological integrity of an aquatic system by its rapid response to changes in environmental conditions. Diatoms are sensitive to the presence of contaminants, so the size of their populations are inversely proportional to the levels of contamination. For the collection of samples of epilitic diatoms were adapted the sampling methodology and observation of Eduardo Lobo. The taxonomic identification of each individual of the species was carried out with the aid of regional and local epilitic diatomic identification guides.

Australian doctors want a register of women buying the emergency pill.,"The proposed sale in Australia of the emergency pill direct to women through pharmacies has sparked more controversy, with the major doctors' group calling for a register of names and addresses. 
 
The Australian Medical Association, which originally opposed the sale of levonorgestrel without a prescription, now wants women to give their names and contact details to pharmacists before getting the drug. 
 
But family planning groups claim that the call is a serious invasion of privacy, which could defeat the purpose and lead to unwanted pregnancies. 
 
The medical association's federal president, Bill Glasson, said it would be trivialising the pill to have women pick it up and disappear without consideration of their total wellbeing. 
 
""I think the issues of the unwanted pregnancy is one issue, but the issues of sexually transmitted diseases, appropriate counselling, the circumstances in which the unprotected intercourse occurred, and obviously ongoing contraception have to be taken into account,"" he said 
 
In June the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee gave first stage approval for levonorgestrel (a hormonal contraceptive that is effective for up to 72 hours after intercourse) to be available over the counter subject to further discussion. 
 
The association fought against the decision, but pressure built up from members supporting early access to emergency contraception. 
 
Dr Glasson said he now supported qualified sale of the emergency pill after a Catholic nun in Brisbane explained the beneficial impact it could have on the scale of teenage pregnancies at her school. But he added: 
 
""If it's been dispensed three weekends in a row then I think we're not being particularly responsible if we continue to use this sort of drug as a form of contraception rather than actually as an emergency hormonal procedure."" 
 
Roberto Rojas-Morales, executive director of Sexual Health and Family Planning Australia, said the group would lobby against the register. 
 
""If that went ahead, you would be on dangerous ground. It would defeat the whole purpose of having emergency contraception over the counter,"" he told the Australian newspaper (5 Sep, 2003:p2). 
 
Lee Fitzroy of Women's Health West in Melbourne said the proposal might prevent women from accessing the pill and increase the risks of unwanted pregnancy. 
 
""We know that often the reasons women don't pick up the normal contraceptive pill is because of privacy issues or confidentiality because they can't get the prescription through their family doctor,"" she said. 
 
The schedule committee is undertaking further public discussion before a decision about sale conditions is made in October. The pill could be available from January in pharmacies that already have registers for certain drugs that are addictive or can be diverted for illicit use.",2003,BMJ
Interaction-Based Feature Selection for Uncovering Cancer Driver Genes Through Copy Number-Driven Expression Level,"Driver gene selection is crucial to understand the heterogeneous system of cancer. To identity cancer driver genes, various statistical strategies have been proposed, especially the L1-type regularization methods have drawn a large amount of attention. However, the statistical approaches have been developed purely from algorithmic and statistical point, and the existing studies have applied the statistical approaches to genomic data analysis without consideration of biological knowledge. We consider a statistical strategy incorporating biological knowledge to identify cancer driver gene. The alterations of copy number have been considered to driver cancer pathogenesis processes, and the region of strong interaction of copy number alterations and expression levels was known as a tumor-related symptom. We incorporate the influence of copy number alterations on expression levels to cancer driver gene-selection processes. To quantify the dependence of copy number alterations on expression levels, we consider [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] effects of copy number alterations on expression levels of genes, and incorporate the symptom of tumor pathogenesis to gene-selection procedures. We then proposed an interaction-based feature-selection strategy based on the adaptive L1-type regularization and random lasso procedures. The proposed method imposes a large amount of penalty on genes corresponding to a low dependency of the two features, thus the coefficients of the genes are estimated to be small or exactly 0. It implies that the proposed method can provide biologically relevant results in cancer driver gene selection. Monte Carlo simulations and analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data show that the proposed strategy is effective for high-dimensional genomic data analysis. Furthermore, the proposed method provides reliable and biologically relevant results for cancer driver gene selection in TCGA data analysis.",2017,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology
Identification and Validation of Tumor Stromal Immunotype in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Background: The immune landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is heterogeneous. This study aims to develop the immune type which could improve predictive value of HCC survival. Methods: A total of 208 HCC patients in the testing cohort, 112 patients in the validation cohort and 365 HCC patients in the TCGA database were included in this study. Immune features were assessed by immunohistochemical staining or CIBERSORT method. We constructed prognostic classifiers by LASSO COX analyses in the TCGA cohort, which identified five features out of the 22 types of immune cells. Results: The formulas based on the immunohistochemical staining are as follows: ISOS = 0.648* Macrophagestromal + 0.444*Neutrophilsstromal + 0.218*Tregsstromal - 0.703*Memory T cellsstromal; ISDFS = 0.285*B cellsstromal + 0.494*Neutrophilsstromal + 0.431*Tregsstromal - 0.736*Memory T cellsstromal. We classified HCC patients into immune type A subgroup (IS-A) and type B subgroup (IS-B) based on immune scores. The immune type was an independent prognostic indicator for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in both testing and validation cohorts. Two nomograms (for OS and DFS) that integrated the immune type and clinicopathologic risk factors also showed good predictive accuracy and discriminatory power. IS-A group was correlated with higher immune checkpoint molecule expression. In addition, patients with IS-A and IS-B had distinct mutation signature. Conclusion: The immune types could predict survival and recurrence of HCC effectively. In addition, the immunosuppressive pathways and mutation signature are distinct between two immune types.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology
On Sparsity Inducing Regularization Methods for Machine Learning,"During the past few years there has been an explosion of interest in learning methods based on sparsity regularization. In this chapter, we discuss a general class of such methods, in which the regularizer can be expressed as the composition of a convex function Ï‰ with a linear function. This setting includes several methods such as the Group Lasso, the Fused Lasso, multi-task learning and many more. We present a general approach for solving regularization problems of this kind, under the assumption that the proximity operator of the function Ï‰ is available. Furthermore, we comment on the application of this approach to support vector machines, a technique pioneered by the groundbreaking work of Vladimir Vapnik.",2013,
Complete pulmonary vein isolation guided by three-dimensional electroanatomical mapping for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.,"AIMS
Evaluation of the clinical outcome of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) treated with complete pulmonary vein (PV) isolation guided by three-dimensional (3-D) electroanatomical (EA) mapping.


METHODS
Circumferential radiofrequency (RF) ablation and continuous circular lesions (CCLs) around the left and right-sided PVs were performed in 4 highly symptomatic patients (2 males; age 57.5 +/- 8.3 years) with HOCM and anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) refractory paroxysmal AF. Ablation was guided by 3-D EA mapping combined with conventional circumferential PV mapping. The endpoints of the ablation were defined as: (1) absence of all PV spikes documented with the two Lasso catheters within the ipsilateral PVs; and (2) no recurrence of the PV spikes within all PVs following intravenous administration of adenosine.


RESULTS
The ablation endpoints were achieved in all patients. A repeat ablation was performed in one patient due to repetitive atrial tachycardia, 1 month after the initial procedure. During a follow-up of 5.8 +/- 2.7 months, all patients are free of AF recurrence. Short episodes of symptomatic AT were documented after the repeat procedure, and were well controlled with oral amiodarone in the patient. No procedure-related complications were observed.


CONCLUSION
The present study demonstrates that complete isolation of ipsilateral PVs guided by 3-D EA mapping is potentially effective for the treatment of highly symptomatic, drug refractory paroxysmal AF in patients with HOCM.",2005,"Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology"
Learning surrogate models for simulationâ€based optimization,"A central problem in modeling, namely that of learning an algebraic model from data obtained from simulations or experiments is addressed. A methodology that uses a small number of simulations or experiments to learn models that are as accurate and as simple as possible is proposed. The approach begins by building a low-complexity surrogate model. The model is built using a best subset technique that leverages an integer programming formulation to allow for the efficient consideration of a large number of possible functional components in the model. The model is then improved systematically through the use of derivative-free optimization solvers to adaptively sample new simulation or experimental points. Automated learning of algebraic models for optimization (ALAMO), the computational implementation of the proposed methodology, along with examples and extensive computational comparisons between ALAMO and a variety of machine learning techniques, including Latin hypercube sampling, simple least-squares regression, and the lasso is described.

Modeling of Pesticide Biodegradation in Soil,"Quantitative Biodegradability-Structure Relationships (QSBRs) are valuable tools for estimating pesticide half-lives in soil. Advance in QSBR modeling is based on several prerequisites: (1) separation of (bio)degradation from formation of non-extractable soil residues (NER), (2) degradation data from a homogeneous soil source, (3) robust predictor selection, (4) proper control of model complexity and (5) validation of model generalization performance on data external to model construction. This study addresses (1) to (5) in two steps. In step one, first order rate constants of both primary degradation and NER formation were calculated from inverse model optimization by Genetic Algorithms, based on 87 Speyer 2.2 soil degradation data sets. Degradation was found to be faster than NER formation for most of the compounds, although both processes were correlated. In a second step, variation in degradation rate constants was modeled by LASSO shrinkage regression and, in addition, by a novel robust filtering technique combined with forward selection, termed Recursive Bootstrap Subsampling (RBS). RBS and shrinkage regression were applied to four predictor sets of increasing complexity and validated by (a) internal crossvalidation (CV), (b) external CV and (c) external CV under proper control of model complexity. As a result, (a) overestimated generalization performance for all models and predictor sets, whereas (b) underestimated the performance achievable with a given data set. (c), on the other hand, gave more reasonable estimates. Moreover, shrinkage regression could outperform RBS under setting (b). However, when (c) control of model complexity was assured and the number p of predictors outnumbered that of the samples n (n << p problem), RBS outperformed shrinkage regression. Therefore, only RBS was utilized to assess the importance of molecular and non-molecular predictors for explaining variation in degradation rates. Of a total of 670 candidate predictors, only few were important. The most relevant ones were: 3 collinear fragments containing sulfur, 2 collinear ester functionalities, 3 collinear N-heteroaromatic moeities, nitrogen with double or triple bonds, a methyl and a methylene descriptor, double bonded oxygen and water-organic carbon partitioning coefficients. It is concluded that a combination of robust predictor selection, external validation and control of model complexity other than internal CV is essential for reliable QSBR modeling.",2010,
The Bayesian lasso for genome-wide association studies,"MOTIVATION
Despite their success in identifying genes that affect complex disease or traits, current genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on a single SNP analysis are too simple to elucidate a comprehensive picture of the genetic architecture of phenotypes. A simultaneous analysis of a large number of SNPs, although statistically challenging, especially with a small number of samples, is crucial for genetic modeling.


METHOD
We propose a two-stage procedure for multi-SNP modeling and analysis in GWASs, by first producing a 'preconditioned' response variable using a supervised principle component analysis and then formulating Bayesian lasso to select a subset of significant SNPs. The Bayesian lasso is implemented with a hierarchical model, in which scale mixtures of normal are used as prior distributions for the genetic effects and exponential priors are considered for their variances, and then solved by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Our approach obviates the choice of the lasso parameter by imposing a diffuse hyperprior on it and estimating it along with other parameters and is particularly powerful for selecting the most relevant SNPs for GWASs, where the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations.


RESULTS
The new approach was examined through a simulation study. By using the approach to analyze a real dataset from the Framingham Heart Study, we detected several significant genes that are associated with body mass index (BMI). Our findings support the previous results about BMI-related SNPs and, meanwhile, gain new insights into the genetic control of this trait.

Classification with Sparse Overlapping Groups,"Classification with a sparsity constraint on the solution plays a central role in many high dimensional machine learning applications. In some cases, the features can be grouped together so that entire subsets of features can be selected or not selected. In many applications, however, this can be too restrictive. In this paper, we are interested in a less restrictive form of structured sparse feature selection: we assume that while features can be grouped according to some notion of similarity, not all features in a group need be selected for the task at hand. When the groups are comprised of disjoint sets of features, this is sometimes referred to as the ""sparse group"" lasso, and it allows for working with a richer class of models than traditional group lasso methods. Our framework generalizes conventional sparse group lasso further by allowing for overlapping groups, an additional flexiblity needed in many applications and one that presents further challenges. The main contribution of this paper is a new procedure called Sparse Overlapping Group (SOG) lasso, a convex optimization program that automatically selects similar features for classification in high dimensions. We establish model selection error bounds for SOGlasso classification problems under a fairly general setting. In particular, the error bounds are the first such results for classification using the sparse group lasso. Furthermore, the general SOGlasso bound specializes to results for the lasso and the group lasso, some known and some new. The SOGlasso is motivated by multi-subject fMRI studies in which functional activity is classified using brain voxels as features, source localization problems in Magnetoencephalography (MEG), and analyzing gene activation patterns in microarray data analysis. Experiments with real and synthetic data demonstrate the advantages of SOGlasso compared to the lasso and group lasso.",2014,arXiv: Learning
Management of foreign bodies in the esophagus.,"To the Editor.â€” I should like to comment on Dr Palmer's discussion of the management of foreign bodies in the esophagus (""Backyard Barbecue Syndrome,"" 235:2637, 1976). As Dr Palmer suggests, we tend to approach the impacted bolus of meat endoscopically with expedition. Contrary to his experience, we have had excellent success using fiberoptic endoscopic equipment in this procedure. We have found that endoscopes used in conjunction with available special service biopsy forceps and polypectomy snares provide an excellent method for removing food that has become impacted in the distal esophagus. In general, a bolus of food can be removed with the polypectomy snare. To do this, one ""lassos"" the bolus and then pulls it and the gastroscope out together, thus removing the food bolus. Since the bolus is liable to fragment, this often takes three to six passages of the gastroscope. Often, the food bolus is sufficiently modified in size",1976,JAMA
"Multi-Resolution Functional ANOVA for Large-Scale, Many-Input Computer Experiments","The Gaussian process is a standard tool for building emulators for both deterministic and stochastic computer experiments. However, application of Gaussian process models is greatly limited in practice, particularly for large-scale and many-input computer experiments that have become typical. We propose a multi-resolution functional ANOVA model as a computationally feasible emulation alternative. More generally, this model can be used for large-scale and many-input non-linear regression problems. An overlapping group lasso approach is used for estimation, ensuring computational feasibility in a large-scale and many-input setting. New results on consistency and inference for the (potentially overlapping) group lasso in a high-dimensional setting are developed and applied to the proposed multi-resolution functional ANOVA model. Importantly, these results allow us to quantify the uncertainty in our predictions. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed model enjoys marked computational advantages. Data capabilities, both in terms of sample size and dimension, meet or exceed best available emulation tools while meeting or exceeding emulation accuracy.",2017,arXiv: Methodology

OBESITY AND SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AS RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES IN CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN MARINGAÌ, PR - BRAZIL","It is estimated that cardiovascular diseases in Brazil are responsible for approximately 20% of deaths. Smoking, high blood pressure, dyslipidemias and diabetes mellitus besides obesity and physical inactivity are among the risk factors that increase the probability to develop such diseases. This study aimed at verifying cardiovascular diseases risk factors in children and teenagers from public schools in MaringÃ¡, PR Brazil, mainly focusing overweight and physical activity through blood pressure evaluation, body composition and physical aptitude. 52% of the evaluated children were boys and 48%, girls. Concerning physical activity, 49% of students affirmed they practice some kind of physical activity and most of them were boys. Concerning body mass index, 67% presented normal results, 12% were overweight and 8% were obese. Blood pressure presented normal values in 85% of the evaluated children. Flexibility, jump and speed tests as well as waist-hip ratio when related to body mass index proved not to have dependence among variables, while blood pressure and the abdominal test presented dependence. Cooper running test values were below expected. Based on the results from this research, we conclude that, though in small scale, there are predisposing factors to the development of cardiovascular diseases among the studied children and teenagers. Therefore, the necessity of programs aiming at preventing these risk factors is evident. People should be involved from childhood so that future consequences might be avoided.

Among 280 adults with clinical diagnosis of severe malaria, only 60 were confirmed to have severe forms of malaria after the laboratory investigations. Most of these patients (49 cases) were living in the city. The average age was 29.2 years +/- 13.1. At hospital admission, the average temperature was 39.1 degrees C +/- 1 and signs of severe malaria were dominated by impaired consciousness (43 cases), multiple convulsions (6 cases) and severe anaemia (6 cases). Two of these signs were associated in the third of patients. The average parasite density at admission was 11,660 parasites per microliter. 85% of patients hospitalized recovered, 8% died and 7% escaped. The control thick smear at day 3 showed that 23% of patients were still positive. At day 7 none of them was positive.

Reply to H. Kehlet,"Dear Sir I regret without prejudice, to point out that after careful re-reading, every single reference of F. Glassow and E. Ryan covers inguinal as well as femoral statistics in women, even when the titles emphasize femoral hernias. It stands to reason and scholarship that when series of 27,000, 28,412, 43,000, 50,000 or 75,000 cases are reported, many additional statistics other than recurrence would invariably be discovered and incorporated. This is the strength of the large volumes of the Shouldice institution which frequently reports on its cumulative total of 300,000 (and mounting) operations. Through either published or inferred statistics from the Shouldice Hospital, I would hasten to disagree with the statement by H. Kehlet and M. Bay-Nielsen that their series is either the first or the largest. Welsh and Alexander reported 9,671 operations on females in 1993, (4.5% of 214,919 operations) [1]. My own results and statistics on female hernias, in absolute and relative terms in comparison to those in men, are in complete agreement with those of Ryan and Glassow, namely that recurrences, whether inguinal or femoral, are seen far less frequently in women than in men.",2005,Hernia

A novel LASSO-based feature weighting selection method for microarray data classification,"The biological data, especially microarray data has become more and more important for medical diagnostics. Microarray data usually has high dimension with small sample size and the positive samples are scarce, which makes the data severely imbalanced. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection model for high dimensions and imbalance data. Firstly, by computing the feature-label correlation we remove the low-score features which we consider are irrelevant. Then, a combined feature selection is employed in which the first stage is to remove the redundant features by using a correlation-based feature selection and then we propose a LASSO-based feature weighting approach to increase the weight of the key data. Finally, considering the imbalance problem, we process the selected data to obtain the balanced one by Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which will be used before classifier training. We use the Ten-fold cross-validationon the datasets. The experimental results on different classifiers show that the proposed method can achieve a higher accuracy and Area Under Curve (AUC) than the traditional feature selection methods.",2015,
"MS-271, a novel inhibitor of calmodulin-activated myosin light chain kinase from Streptomyces sp.--II. Solution structure of MS-271: characteristic features of the ""lasso' structure.","MS-271 is a potent inhibitor of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), obtained from Streptomyces sp. In the previous paper, we reported on the isolation, structural determination and biological properties of MS-271.(1) In this paper, we report on the three-dimensional structure of MS-271 determined by 1H NMR in deuterated dimethyl sulphoxide. MS-271 consists of 21 amino acid residues with a novel internal linkage between the beta-carboxyl group of Asp9 and the alpha-amino group of Cysl, and two disulfide bonds, Cys1-Cys13 and Cys7-Cys19. The internal linkage between the side chain of Asp9 and the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal residue is the same as that of the endothelin B receptor selective antagonist, RES-701-1, that we previously reported. The structural calculations involved the combined use of distance geometry and simulated annealing calculations. The results indicated that MS-271 undergoes extraordinary folding, i.e. the ""tail' (Phe10-dTrp21) passes through the ""ring' region (Cys1-Asp9) (""lasso' structure). This folding of MS-271 turned out to be the same as the ""lasso' structure of RES-701-1.

"Integrated palynological, organic geochemical, and sequence stratigraphic analyses of the middle to upper Cenomanian hydrocarbon reservoir/source Abu Roash â€œGâ€ Member: A depositional model in northwestern Egypt","Abstract The current investigation provides further insight into the petroliferous characteristics of the Abu Roash â€œGâ€ Member, which is regarded as an important rock unit for the Egyptian oil industry. Forty-seven samples covering the â€œGâ€ Member were selected from the BED 14-1 and BED 2-4 wells in the Abu Gharadig Basin and from the Abu Tunis 1X well in the Matruh Basin, both of which are located in the north Western Desert. An independent dating of the â€œGâ€ rocks of BED 2-4 by benthic foraminifera and ostracods, in addition to palynological dating, suggests a middle-late Cenomanian age and provides the biochronostratigraphic framework for the sequence stratigraphic analysis. Analysis of the vertical distribution of particulate organic matter defines three palynofacies types (PF). PF-1 represents the basal â€œGâ€, where shales of the BED wells and calcareous shale of Abu Tunis 1X were deposited during a relative sea level rise in an outer middle shelf environment that experienced a notable high primary productivity. Prevailing reducing (suboxic-anoxic) conditions supported preservation of very high amounts of amorphous organic matter (AOM) in PF-1. PF-2 is equated to shales of the middle â€œGâ€ of BED 14-1 and BED 2-4 and to calcareous shales and limestone of the upper â€œGâ€ in Abu Tunis 1X. PF-2 was deposited during a relative sea level fall in an inner middle shelf setting under better-developed suboxic-anoxic conditions. PF-3 corresponds to the upper â€œGâ€ of BED 14-1 and BED 2-4 and represents the shallowest setting, where sandy and silty shales were deposited during a pronounced sea level fall in an inner shelf environment. The same suboxic-anoxic conditions were prevailing during deposition of PF-3. Three bioevents were recorded, which could be of palaeoecological and/or biostratigraphic significance. These are Senegalinium aenigmaticum-Dinopterygium cladoides peak, Dinopterygium cladoides-Dinopterygium alatum peak, and an acme of Classopollis brasiliensis. Sequence stratigraphy of a transect of the four studied sections was carried out to understand the response of the particulate organic matter distribution and depositional system to the sea level changes. Three third-order, depositional genetic sequences were recognized and correlated with the global sea level curve (KCe 2, KCe 3, and KCe 4). The early highstand systems tract (eHST) of the genetically related KCe 3 in all wells is characterized by relatively rich organic matter, where combined remarkably low water circulation and insignificant dilution of organic matter with coarse terrigenous material probably supported good preservation of organic matter. Spatial distribution of the â€œGâ€ rocks shows lateral facies changes. This was inferred from sedimentation of an organic-poor (avg. 0.8 TOC wt %), coarse clastic (sandy shales) facies in the studied area in Abu Gharadig Basin. Sedimentation changes laterally into a northeast and northwest organic-rich, finer clastic (shale, calcareous shales, and argillaceous limestone) facies in the western Matruh Basin. The robust anoxic conditions and very low dilution of organic matter by terrigenous influx enhanced the organic richness (avg. 2.4 TOC wt %) of these rocks, which resulted in the formation of promising hydrocarbon source rocks. Thus, for a successful hydrocarbon exploration in the north Western Desert, the promising source section of the â€œGâ€ Member would be associated with shales, calcareous shales, and argillaceous limestone lithologies. Its depositional environment is mainly confined to outer middle and inner middle shelf settings that have widespread suboxic-anoxic conditions and show eHST pattern. In contrast, the regressive intervals that are denoted by the lowstand systems tract (LST) and/or the late HST (lHST) typify the relatively coarse clastics as good quality reservoir rocks that are characterized by poor organic richness due to dilution with terrigenous influx.",2017,Marine and Petroleum Geology
Epiphytic seaweeds and invertebrates associated with South African populations of the rocky shore seagrass Thalassodendron leptocaule â€” a hidden wealth of biodiversity,"Seagrasses support a great diversity of epiphytic organisms.

Genomic DNA Methylation-Derived Algorithm Enables Accurate Detection of Malignant Prostate Tissues,"Introduction
The current methodology involving diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) relies on the pathology examination of prostate needle biopsies, a method with high false negative rates partly due to temporospatial, molecular, and morphological heterogeneity of prostate adenocarcinoma. It is postulated that molecular markers have a potential to assign diagnosis to a considerable portion of undetected prostate tumors. This study examines the genome-wide DNA methylation changes in PCa in search of genomic markers for the development of a diagnostic algorithm for PCa screening.


Methods
Archival PCa and normal tissues were assessed using genomic DNA methylation arrays. Differentially methylated sites and regions (DMRs) were used for functional assessment, gene-set enrichment and protein interaction analyses, and examination of transcription factor-binding patterns. Raw signal intensity data were used for identification of recurrent copy number variations (CNVs). Non-redundant fully differentiating cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs), which did not overlap CNV segments, were used in an L1 regularized logistic regression model (LASSO) to train a classification algorithm. Validation of this algorithm was performed using a large external cohort of benign and tumor prostate arrays.


Results
Approximately 6,000 probes and 600 genomic regions showed significant DNA methylation changes, primarily involving hypermethylation. Gene-set enrichment and protein interaction analyses found an overrepresentation of genes related to cell communications, neurogenesis, and proliferation. Motif enrichment analysis demonstrated enrichment of tumor suppressor-binding sites nearby DMRs. Several of these regions were also found to contain copy number amplifications. Using four non-redundant fully differentiating CpGs, we trained a classification model with 100% accuracy in discriminating tumors from benign samples. Validation of this algorithm using an external cohort of 234 tumors and 92 benign samples yielded 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity. The model was found to be highly sensitive to detect metastatic lesions in bone, lymph node, and soft tissue, while being specific enough to differentiate the benign hyperplasia of prostate from tumor.


Conclusion
A considerable component of PCa DNA methylation profile represent driver events potentially established/maintained by disruption of tumor suppressor activity. As few as four CpGs from this profile can be used for screening of PCa.",2018,Frontiers in Oncology
A New Sparse and Robust Adaptive Lasso Estimator for the Independent Contamination Model,"Many problems in signal processing require finding sparse solutions to under-determined, or ill-conditioned, linear systems of equations. When dealing with real-world data, the presence of outliers and impulsive noise must also be accounted for. In past decades, the vast majority of robust linear regression estimators has focused on robustness against rowwise contamination. Even so called `high breakdown' estimators rely on the assumption that a majority of rows of the regression matrix is not affected by outliers. Only very recently, the first cellwise robust regression estimation methods have been developed. In this paper, we define robust oracle properties, which an estimator must have in order to perform robust model selection for under-determined, or ill-conditioned linear regression models that are contaminated by cellwise outliers in the regression matrix. We propose and analyze a robustly weighted and adaptive Lasso type regularization term which takes into account cellwise outliers for model selection. The proposed regularization term is integrated into the objective function of the MM-estimator, which yields the proposed MM-Robust Weighted Adaptive Lasso (MM-RWAL), for which we prove that at least the weak robust oracle properties hold. A performance comparison to existing robust Lasso estimators is provided using Monte Carlo experiments. Further, the MM-RWAL is applied to determine the temporal releases of the European Tracer Experiment (ETEX) at the source location. This ill-conditioned linear inverse problem contains cellwise and rowwise outliers and is sparse both in the regression matrix and the parameter vector. The proposed RWAL penalty is not limited to the MM-estimator but can easily be integrated into the objective function of other robust estimators.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory
"Multispectral Resampling of Seagrass Species Spectra: WorldView-2, Quickbird, Sentinel-2A, ASTER VNIR, and Landsat 8 OLI","Although spectrally different, seagrass species may not be able to be mapped from multispectral remote sensing images due to the limitation of their spectral resolution. Therefore, it is important to quantitatively assess the possibility of mapping seagrass species using multispectral images by resampling seagrass species spectra to multispectral bands. Seagrass species spectra were measured on harvested seagrass leaves. Spectral resolution of multispectral images used in this research was adopted from WorldView-2, Quickbird, Sentinel-2A, ASTER VNIR, and Landsat 8 OLI. These images are widely available and can be a good representative and baseline for previous or future remote sensing images. Seagrass species considered in this research are Enhalus acoroides (Ea), Thalassodendron ciliatum (Tc), Thalassia hemprichii (Th), Cymodocea rotundata (Cr), Cymodocea serrulata (Cs), Halodule uninervis (Hu), Halodule pinifolia (Hp), Syringodum isoetifolium (Si), Halophila ovalis (Ho), and Halophila minor (Hm). Multispectral resampling analysis indicate that the resampled spectra exhibit similar shape and pattern with the original spectra but less precise, and they lose the unique absorption feature of seagrass species. Relying on spectral bands alone, multispectral image is not effective in mapping these seagrass species individually, which is shown by the poor and inconsistent result of Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification technique in classifying seagrass species using seagrass species spectra as pure endmember. Only Sentinel-2A produced acceptable classification result using SAM.",2017,

Covarience Estimation and Performance of Satellite Imaginary Data Using Smt,"Covariance estimation for high dimensional vectors is a classically difficult problem in statistical analysis and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to covariance estimation, which employs a novel sparsity constraint. More specifically, the covariance is constrained to havean Eigen decomposition which can be represented as a sparse matrix transforms (SMT). The SMT is formed by a product of pairwise coordinate rotations knownas Givens rotations. Using this framework, the covariance can be efficiently estimated using greedy minimization of the log likelihood function, and the number of Givens rotations can be efficiently computed using a cross-validation procedure. The resulting estimator is positive definite and well-conditioned even whenthe sample size is limited. Experiments on standard hyper-spectral data sets show that the SMT covariance estimate is consistently more accurate than both traditional shrinkage estimates and recently proposed graphical lasso estimates for a variety of different classes and sample sizes.",2013,
Incorporating correlations between drugs and heterogeneity of multi-omics data in structured penalized regression for drug sensitivity prediction,"Targeted cancer drugs have been developed to interfere with specific molecular targets, which are expected to affect the growth of cancer cells in a way that can be characterized by multi-omics data. The prediction of cancer drug sensitivity simultaneously for multiple drugs based on heterogeneous multi-omics data (e.g., mRNA expression, DNA copy number or DNA mutation) is an important but challenging task. We use joint penalized regression models for multiple cancer drugs rather than a separate model for each drug, thus being able to address the correlation structure between drugs. In addition, we employ integrative penalty factors (IPF) to allow penalizing data from different molecular data sources differently. By integrating IPF with tree-lasso, we create the IPF-tree-lasso method, which can capture the heterogeneity of multi-omics data and the correlation between drugs at the same time. Additionally, we generalize the IPF-lasso to the IPF-elastic-net, which combines $\ell_1$- and $\ell_2$-penalty terms and can lead to improved prediction performance. To make the computation of IPF-type methods more feasible, we present that the IPF-type methods are equivalent to the original lasso-type methods after augmenting the data matrix, and employ the Efficient Parameter Selection via Global Optimization (EPSGO) algorithm for optimizing multiple penalty factors efficiently. Simulation studies show that the new model, IPF-tree-lasso, can improve the prediction performance significantly. We demonstrate the performance of these methods on the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) data.",2019,
Feature extraction of big climate data,"Abstract Variables related to climate change are divided into quantitative variables and qualitative variables. Quantitative variables, such as temperature and precipitation, take on numerical values, whereas qualitative variables, such as land types, take on values in one of different categories or classes. Regression is a process of predicting qualitative response, whereas clustering or classification is a process of predicting qualitative responses. The most widely used regression in the context of big data are Ridge and Lasso regressions. Big climatic data environment can enhance the tendency of classical linear regression model to overfit. Ridge and lasso regressions are more suitable to handle big data environment than classical regression since they can control the size of regression coefficients. The most widely-used classifiers in the context of big data are linear discriminant analysis and K-nearest neighbors. More state-of-the-art classifiers include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and so on. These methods provide managing an efficient exploitation of big data from Earth observation systems.",2020,
The Tracking & Analysis of Cell Movement with Cell-Derived Active Contours & Generative Graphical Models,"There has been a continuous effort (Li et al., 2009; Al-Kofahi and Lassoued, 2010; Al-Kofahi et al., 2011; AmbÃ¼hl et al., 2012; Meijering, 2012; MaÅ¡ka et al., 2014) to provide tools for large-scale automated analysis of live cell morphology in vitro, as this very important for studying biological development and disease. In this thesis, we outline a set of theoretical and practical tools that we have developed for this purpose. In chapters 1-5 we present a new cell-derived active contour (CDAC) method for cell tracking that achieves higher tracking accuracy using knowledge about cell movements. This knowledge consists of the way cells move by adhering to the substrate and propelling their cell membranes in the direction normal to the edge. This allows use of fast optimal search methods. Our method is designed for phase contrast microscopy, which allows access to a wider variety of experimental data. It can operate under conditions of low illumination. This is important for live-cell imaging as high illumination can damage cells. Additionally, our method demonstrates a higher robustness to noise than many previous methods. We then develop a statistical framework for cell shape analysis. Due to the large dimensionality of the space of cell shapes, we first use a neural network model to extract a small set of relevant features. This allows efficient learning and this makes our method distinct from previous methods (such as kernel density estimation). We then develop a rotation-invariant framework a property that has not been incorporated in previous cell shape model studies and is a limitation of other models to construct a hierarchical Bayesian generative model to learn the distribution of cell shapes. We show that this new property allows, for the first time, deriving features such as elongation or cell asymmetry directly from the data without any prior assumptions. In this work we maintain a close relationship between experiment and theory. The problem of calculation of cell movement indices from experiment is studied and related to theoretical models. We also use theoretical models to validate our morphology analysis framework, showing good statistical agreement with natural cells.",2015,
Large-System Estimation Performance in Noisy Compressed Sensing with Random Support-a Bayesian Analysis,"Compressed sensing (CS) enables measurement reconstruction by using sampling rates below the Nyquist rate, as long as the amplitude vector of interest is sparse. In this work, we first derive and analyze the Bayesian CramÃ©r-Rao Bound (BCRB) for the amplitude vector when the set of indices (the support) of its non-zero entries is known. We consider the following context: (i) The dictionary is non-stochastic but randomly generated; (ii) the number of measurements and the support cardinality grow to infinity in a controlled manner, i.e. the ratio of these quantities converges to a constant; (iii) the support is random; and (iv) the vector of non-zero amplitudes follow a multidimensional generalized normal distribution. Using results from random matrix theory, we obtain closed-form approximations of the BCRB. These approximations can be formulated in a very compact form in low and high SNR regimes. Secondly, we provide a statistical analysis of the variance and the statistical efficiency of the oracle linear mean-square-error (LMMSE) estimator. Finally, we present results from numerical investigations in the context of non-bandlimited finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signal sampling. We show that the performance of Bayesian mean square error (BMSE) estimators that are aware of the cardinality of the support, such as OMP and CoSaMP, are in good agreement with the developed lower bounds in the high SNR regime. Conversely, sparse estimators exploiting only the knowledge of the parameter vector and the noise variance in form of a-priori distributions of these parameters, like LASSO and BPDN, are not efficient at high SNR. However, at low SNR their BMSE is lower than that of the former estimators and may be close to the BCRB.",2016,
Automatic regularization of cross-entropy cost for speaker recognition fusion,"In this paper we study automatic regularization techniques for the fusion of automatic speaker recognition systems. Parameter regularization could dramatically reduce the fusion training time. In addition, there will not be any need for splitting the development set into different folds for cross- validation. We utilize majorization-minimization approach to automatic ridge regression learning and design a similar way to learn LASSO regularization parameter automatically. By experiments we show improvement in using automatic regularization.",2013,

The Use of Ozone in a Complex Spa Treatment and Its Effect on Functional Potential of Cardiovascular System and on Specific Resistance in Patients with Ischemic Heart Disease,"The aim of the work is to study the ozonetherapy effect in subtropical conditions of the Caucasian Black Sea coast on adaptive potentials of cardiovascular system in patients with stenocardia of groups I, II and III.There were examined and treated 134 patients with cardio-vascular disorders, 80 having stenocardia.The ozonated saline (0,9%) NaCl) was prepared with â€œMedozonâ€ ozonator. The course of ozonetherapy consisted of 6 sessions of ozonated saline infusions of 200ml (ozone concentration â€“1,0 mgr/l) done every second day. Apart from ozonetherapy, complex spa treatment included thalassotherapy, aerotherapy, heliotherapy, balneotherapy and diet therapy.The received results demonstrated positive dynamics of stroke and minute blood volume and cardiac index, testifying the improvement of blood circulation and of cardiac pump function. These data were confirmed by EKG veloergometry readings. Ozonetherapy proved to increase functional potentials of cardiovascular system, its functional economy and capacity (tolerance to physical loads, the scope of work, etc).",2001,
Biocontrol method in aquaculture for rearing the swimming crab larvae Portunus trituberculatus,"The aim of this work is to control the water environment for culturing larvae of the swimming crab, Portunus trituberculatus, using microorganisms. The bacterial strain PM-4 (Thalassobacter utilis) improved the survival rate of crab larvae and repressed the growth of Vibrio anguillarum (bacterium) and Haliphthoros sp.(fungus) in seawater. PM-4 was cultured and added daily to seawater during the first to third zoean growth stage of the crab with diatoms and rotifers. Numbers of PM-4 decreased in culture water during the first 3 days, because of feeding by the first zoean stage of larvae. The final concentration of PM-4 was 105 to 106 cells m1âˆ’1 according to the plate count method in larval rearing water. During 1989 to 1993, we tried seed productions of a swimming crab in 200 m3 containers at Tamano Station, Japan Sea-Farming Association. In 33 trials of the biocontrol methods, average survival rate of crab larvae was 28.3% when the bacterial strain PM-4 was added. In 42 trials in which the strain PM-4 was not added, average survival rate of crab larvae was 15.6%. We conclude that the bacterial strain PM-4 is effective as a biocontrol agent.",1997,Hydrobiologia
System Analysis of Gene Regulatory Networks,"Experimental innovations starting in the 1990â€™s leading to the advent of high-throughput experiments in cellular biology have made it possible to measure thousands of genes simultaneously at a modest cost. This enables the discovery of new unexpected relationships between genes in addition to the possibility of falsify existing. To benefit as much as possible from these experiments the new inter disciplinary research field of systems biology have materialized. Systems biology goes beyond the conventional reductionist approach and aims at learning the whole system under the assumption that the system is greater than the sum of its parts. One emerging enterprise in systems biology is to use the high-throughput data to reverse engineer the web of gene regulatory interactions governing the cellular dynamics. This relatively new endeavor goes further than clustering genes with similar expression patterns and requires the separation of cause of gene expression from the effect. Despite the rapid data increase we then face the problem of having too few experiments to determine which regulations are active as the number of putative interactions has increased dramatic as the number of units in the system has increased. One possibility to overcome this problem is to impose more biologically motivated constraints. However, what is a biological fact or not is often not obvious and may be condition dependent. Moreover, investigations have suggested several statistical facts about gene regulatory networks, which motivate the development of new reverse engineering algorithms, relying on different model assumptions. As a result numerous new reverse engineering algorithms for gene regulatory networks has been proposed. As a consequent, there has grown an interest in the community to assess the performance of different attempts in fair trials on â€œrealâ€ biological problems. This resulted in the annually held DREAM conference which contains computational challenges that can be solved by the prosing researchers directly, and are evaluated by the chairs of the conference after the submission deadline. This thesis contains the evolution of regularization schemes to reverse engineer gene networks from high-throughput data within the framework of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, to understand gene networks a substantial part of it also concerns statistical analysis of gene networks. First, we reverse engineer a genome-wide regulatory network based solely on microarray data utilizing an extremely simple strategy assuming sparseness (LASSO). To validate and analyze this network we also develop some statistical tools. Then we present a refinement of the initial strategy which is the algorithm for which we achieved best performer at the DREAM2 conference. This strategy is further refined into a reverse engineering scheme which also can include external high-throughput data, which we confirm to be of relevance as we achieved best performer in the DREAM3 conference as well. Finally, the tools we developed to analyze stability and flexibility in linearized ordinary differential equations representing gene regulatory networks is further discussed.",2010,
Evaluation of Ride-Sourcing Search Frictions and Driver Productivity: A Spatial Denoising Approach,"This paper considers the problem of spatial and temporal mispricing of ride-sourcing trips from a driver perspective. Using empirical data from more than 1.1 million rides in Austin, Texas, we explore the spatial structure of ride-sourcing search frictions and driver performance variables as a function of the trip destination. The spatial information is subject to noise and sparsity, and researchers tend to aggregate the data in large areas, which results in the loss of high-resolution insights. We implemented the graph-fused lasso (GFL), a spatial smoothing or denoising methodology that allows for high-definition spatial evaluation. GFL removes noise in discrete areas by emphasizing edges, which is practical for evaluating zones with heterogeneous types of trips, such as airports, without blurring the information to surrounding areas. Principal findings suggest that there are differences in driver productivity depending on trip type and pickup and drop-off location. Therefore, providing spatio-temporal pricing strategies could be one way to balance driver equity across the network.",2018,arXiv: Applications
The PhaseLift for Non-quadratic Gaussian Measurements,"We study the problem of recovering a structured signal $\mathbf{x}_0$ from high-dimensional measurements of the form $y=f(\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{x}_0)$ for some nonlinear function $f$. When the measurement vector $\mathbf a$ is iid Gaussian, Brillinger observed in his 1982 paper that $\mu_\ell\cdot\mathbf{x}_0 = \min_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbb{E}(y - \mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{x})^2$, where $\mu_\ell=\mathbb{E}_{\gamma}[\gamma f(\gamma)]$ with $\gamma$ being a standard Gaussian random variable. Based on this simple observation, he showed that, in the classical statistical setting, the least-squares method is consistent. More recently, Plan \& Vershynin extended this result to the high-dimensional setting and derived error bounds for the generalized Lasso. Unfortunately, both least-squares and the Lasso fail to recover $\mathbf{x}_0$ when $\mu_\ell=0$. For example, this includes all even link functions. We resolve this issue by proposing and analyzing an appropriate generic semidefinite-optimization based method. In a nutshell, our idea is to treat such link functions as if they were linear in a lifted space of higher-dimension. An appealing feature of our error analysis is that it captures the effect of the nonlinearity in a few simple summary parameters, which can be particularly useful in system design.",2017,arXiv: Machine Learning
Filter-Wrapper Combination and Embedded Feature Selection for Gene Expression Data,"Biomedical and bioinformatics datasets are generally large in terms of their number of features and include redundant and irrelevant features, which affect the effectiveness and efficiency of classification of these datasets. Several different features selection methods have been utilised in various fields, including bioinformatics, to reduce the number of features. This study utilised Filter-Wrapper combination and embedded (LASSO) feature selection methods on both high and low dimensional datasets before classification was performed. The results illustrate that the combination of filter and wrapper feature selection to create a hybrid form of feature selection provides better performance than using filter only. In addition, LASSO performed better on high dimensional data.",2018,
Robust Calculation and Parameter Estimation of the Hourly Price Forward Curve,"Deregulated energy market participants mostly mustusetheHourly PriceForward Curves (HPFC)to evaluate their long term energy price contracts. We propose a new framework to estimate hourly, daily and yearly energy price profiles, based on the median estimation, instead of the widely used mean value. Hourly and daily data used for es- timation are normalized in order to minimize the seasonal- ity bias in our predictions. Given the high dimensionality of the problem, we use the LAD-Lasso model selection as a way to prevent data overfitting. To test the proposed frame- work we used the German electricity spot price time-series. We discuss the effects of large negative hourly prices, resid- uals of daily estimation and data outliers. We show that our framework provides significantly improved estimation of the HPFC compared to the simple mean estimators.",2011,
A combined approach for predicting sparse variables such as tips ratio and daily precipitation,"Author(s): Li, Jinshu | Advisor(s): WU, YINGNIAN | Abstract: A sparse variable is a variable whose values are mostly zero. Because of its sparsity, satisfactory prediction results of a sparse variable usually cannot be obtained by either pure (i.e. single) regression or pure classification machine learning methods. Therefore, to resolve this difficulty, this thesis paper proposes a framework that combines a regression model and a classification model. Furthermore, two types of the combined regression and classification framework are discussed, and their differences are illustrated. Two sparse variables are selected as the case studies: taxi tips ratio (i.e. tips amount divided by total fare) and daily precipitation volume (i.e. total rainfall amount in one day). The author first employs Lasso regression to select relevant features for each sparse variable, with the best Lasso parameter determined by cross-validation (CV). Second, the author selects Logistic regression and the AdaBoost method as the classification methods, while the XGBoost method is chosen as the regression method. The hyperparameters are determined by fine-tuning. The author then surveys over the prediction results of the pure classification method, the pure regression method, and the combined method, using root mean square error (RMSE) as the metric. The results show that the pure regression method provides the least RMSE for both variables; however, it does not satisfy the sparsity requirement. On the contrary, the combined method, whose RMSE is close to the RMSE of the pure regression method, can also provide the sparse results, which makes it an efficient way to predict sparse variables like taxi tip ratio and daily precipitation.",2019,
Multi-step ahead time series forecasting via sparse coding and dictionary based techniques,"Abstract Sparse coding is based on the concept of having a large dictionary of candidate basis vectors. Any given vector is expressed as a sparse linear combination of the dictionary vectors. It has been developed in the signal processing field, and has many applications in data compression and image processing. In this paper we propose applying sparse coding to the time series forecasting field. Specifically, the paper investigates different dictionary based local learning techniques for building predictive models for the time series forecasting problem. The proposed methodology is based on a local learning framework whereby the query point is embedded and coded in terms of a sparse combination of the training dictionary atoms (vectors). Then this embedding is used for estimating the target value of the query point, by applying the same embedding to the target vectors of the dictionary training atoms. We present an experimental study of several sparse coding algorithms. Experiments are performed on the large monthly time series benchmark from the M3 competition, and these experiments showed that the sparse methods Lasso and Elastic-Net presented the best results among the sparse coding algorithms. Moreover, they outperformed the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) regression and most of the compared machine learning and statistical forecasting techniques, especially for higher horizons.",2018,Appl.

Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic responses of natural oil degrading bacteria in the presence of dispersants.,"Oil biodegradation has been extensively studied in the wake of the deepwater horizon spill, but the application of dispersant to oil spills in marine environments remains controversial. Here, we report metagenomic (MG) and metatranscriptomic (MT) data mining from microcosm experiments investigating the oil degrading potential of Canadian west and east coasts to estimate the gene abundance and activity of oil degrading bacteria in the presence of dispersant. We found that the addition of dispersant to crude oil mainly favours the abundance of Thalassolituus in the summer and Oleispira in the winter, two key natural oil degrading bacteria. We found a high abundance of genes related not only to n-alkane and aromatics degradation but also associated with transporters, two-component systems, bacterial motility, secretion systems and bacterial chemotaxis.",2019,Environmental microbiology
SI-ADMM: A Stochastic Inexact ADMM Framework for Stochastic Convex Programs,"We consider the structured stochastic convex program requiring the minimization of $\mathbb{E}[\tilde f(x,\xi)]+\mathbb{E}[\tilde g(y,\xi)]$ subject to the constraint $Ax + By = b$. Motivated by the need for decentralized schemes and structure, we propose a stochastic inexact ADMM (SI-ADMM) framework where subproblems are solved inexactly via stochastic approximation schemes. Based on this framework, we prove the following: (i) under suitable assumptions on the associated batch-size of samples utilized at each iteration, the SI-ADMM scheme produces a sequence that converges to the unique solution almost surely; (ii) If the number of gradient steps (or equivalently, the number of sampled gradients) utilized for solving the subproblems in each iteration increases at a geometric rate, the mean-squared error diminishes to zero at a prescribed geometric rate; (iii) The overall iteration complexity in terms of gradient steps (or equivalently samples) is found to be consistent with the canonical level of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$. Preliminary applications on LASSO and distributed regression suggest that the scheme performs well compared to its competitors.",2017,arXiv: Optimization and Control
The Role of Self-Efficacy on Accounting Near-Graduate Studentsâ€™ Employment Outcomes,"Advances in artificial intelligences and robotics have modernized the business environment of the 21st century. It is not enough for graduates to have only the occupation-specific knowledge and transferrable kills for graduates to meet the needs of labour markets. They are also expected to have a number of personal attributes including self-awareness, self-confidence, independence, emotional intelligence, flexibility and adaptability, creativity and initiative, willingness to be lifelong learner. The present research analyses the association between the three self-efficacy factors of the general selfefficacy scale (GSES): initiative, effort and persistence on accounting near-graduate employment outcomes. The study sample consisted of 337 near-graduate accounting students from Victoria University and Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia. The research employed logistic regression, as well as Lasso and R-glmulti statistical techniques, to examine the main research questions. In addition, Mann-Whitney U tests and Pearson chi-square tests were conducted to examine the association between accounting studentsâ€™ individual characteristics and the three factors of GSES.",2020,
To average or not to average: Trade-off in compressed sensing with noisy measurements,"We consider the situation where the total number of measurements is limited in compressed sensing of sparse vectors with noisy measurements. In this situation there is a trade-off between acquiring as many independent observations as possible and performing averaging over several identical measurements in order to improve signal-to-noise ratio. With the help of the approximate message passing algorithm to solve LASSO problems, we have proved, via state evolution, that in order to minimize estimation errors one should perform as many independent linear measurements as possible rather than performing averaging to improve signal-to-noise ratio of the observations. Furthermore, we have confirmed via numerical experiments that the same holds in the case where the measurement matrix is constructed by randomly subsampling rows of a discrete Fourier matrix.",2014,2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory
A Comparison between LARS and LASSO for Initialising the Time-Series Forecasting Auto-Regressive Equationsâ˜†,"Abstract In this paper the LASSO and LARS estimators to fit auto-regressive time series models as well as OLS are compared. LASSO and LARS are two widely used methods to tackle the variable selection problem. To this end we used 4,004 different time series taken from the M1 and M3 time series competition. As expected, the experiments corroborates that LARS and LASSO derive models that outperform OLS models in terms of the mean square error. It is well known that LARS and LASSO behave similarly; however, the results obtained highlight their differences in terms of forecasting accuracy.",2013,Procedia Technology
Potential application of machine learning in health outcomes research and some statistical cautions.,"Traditional analytic methods are often ill-suited to the evolving world of health care big data characterized by massive volume, complexity, and velocity. In particular, methods are needed that can estimate models efficiently using very large datasets containing healthcare utilization data, clinical data, data from personal devices, and many other sources. Although very large, such datasets can also be quite sparse (e.g., device data may only be available for a small subset of individuals), which creates problems for traditional regression models. Many machine learning methods address such limitations effectively but are still subject to the usual sources of bias that commonly arise in observational studies. Researchers using machine learning methods such as lasso or ridge regression should assess these models using conventional specification tests.",2015,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research
Electron detachment/photodetachment dissociation of lasso peptides,"Abstract Lasso peptides are bioactive peptides produced by bacteria, characterized by a mechanically interlocked topology where the C-terminal tail of the peptide is threaded through and trapped within an N-terminal macrolactam ring. The structural characterization of lasso peptides and differentiation from their unthreaded topoisomers by mass spectrometry are challenging tasks. We previously explored the fragmentation mechanisms of lasso peptides in positive ion mode and showed several signatures of the lasso topology under collision induced dissociation (CID) and electron capture dissociation. Here we analyzed the dissociation of the multiply-deprotonated microcin J25 (MccJ25), a 21-residue lasso peptide produced by Escherichia coli, together with its non-lasso topoisomer and several variants generated by site-directed mutagenesis, under different modes of activation. The fragmentation patterns obtained by CID for the threaded and unthreaded structures were very similar. By contrast, electron detachment dissociation (EDD) as well as activated-electron photodetachment dissociation (a-EPD) revealed very different dissociation pathways for the two topoisomers. The doubly deprotonated topoisomers showed a different deprotonation pattern, Tyr20 residue being deprotonated for MccJ25 only, yielding the singly charged [c19âˆ’C2H4O] product ion. MccJ25 also triggered several two-peptide product ions diagnostic of the lasso topology, including the [(c8)*(z2)] species, which could be maintained by either a covalent or a non-covalent linkage.",2015,International Journal of Mass Spectrometry

Esophageal stricture due to magnesium citrate powder ingestion: a unique case.,"University of Ottawa, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario Correspondence: Dr A Assal, c/o Cindy Taylor, The Ottawa Hospital â€“ General Campus â€“ Box 210-Room 7132, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8L6. Telephone 613-722-7000, e-mail aassal@toh.on.ca Received for publication May 15, 2014. Accepted September 17, 2014 CASE PRESENTATION A 40-year-old man presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and chest pain after ingesting one teaspoon of magnesium (Mg) citrate powder (630 mg of elemental Mg) prescribed by his naturopath for constipation. He failed to mix it with 180 mL (6 oz) of fluid as instructed on the product monograph. Potential adverse effects were not listed. He was initially treated for aspiration pneumonia but returned two weeks later with chest pain and dysphagia. Endoscopy demonstrated severe Los Angeles grade D esophagitis from 18 cm to the gastroesophageal junction. He was discharged with a prescription for an oral proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). Twenty-three days postingestion, he presented with progressively worsening dysphagia and odynophagia. A second endoscopy identified a caustic stricture 25 cm from the incisors. A 6 mm controlled radio expansion wire-guided balloon was used to attempt dilation but was stopped due to fresh heme and tearing. He was admitted to hospital for intravenous fluid and PPI therapy. An upper gastrointestinal barium radiograph identified a tapered narrowing initiating at 3 cm below the cricopharyngeus (Figure 1). The first attempt at endoscopic dilation using a 15 Fr Savary bougie was unsuccessful due to significant transmural inflammation. Next, an ultrathin endoscope was used to pass a guidewire into the stomach and a Hurricane biliary balloon (Boston Scientific, USA) was used to sequentially dilate the stricture to 6 mm to 8 mm. An 18 mm Ã— 170 mm FCSEMS (Hanarostent-Esophagus CCC, MI Tech Co Ltd, USA) was advanced via guidewire and deployed using fluoroscopic guidance (Figure 2). The patient could tolerate a full fluid diet. Subsequent endoscopies at two-week intervals identified 5 cm of distal stent migration, for which proximal esophageal dilation and lasso repositioning were required. Two months after initial placement, the stent was removed and the esophagus was dilated to a diameter of 15 mm. At two follow-up endoscopies, stricturing had recurred, indicating a full-thickness stricture (Figure 3). Surgical management was explored because his quality of life was severely affected. The surgeons performed endoscopy using a smalldiameter Savary bougie dilator to determine the suitability of the gastric mucosa for an esophageal replacement conduit. After this, he developed two areas of contained perforation; he was admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotics. Seven months after initial ingestion, he underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit and feeding jejunostomy.",2014,Canadian journal of gastroenterology & hepatology
