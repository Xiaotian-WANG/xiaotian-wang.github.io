Quality Monitoring and Root Cause Diagnosis for Industrial Processes Based on Lasso-SAE-CCA,"This paper is concerned with theoretical and practices approach for overall quality-related fault detection and identification in process industries. Fault detection and fault tracing can help engineers to take corrective actions and recover the process operations. A novel diagnostic method is proposed based on stacked automatic encoderâˆ’canonical correlation analysis (SAEâˆ’CCA) and least absolute shrinkage selection operator (Lasso). First, a quality monitoring scheme based on SAEâˆ’CCA is proposed, which establishes a relationship model among quality and characteristic variables to detect faults. Then, Lasso is used for locating the root causes, according to the process state and fault information. Finally, the experiments are conducted with typical industry process data, i.e., a hot strip mill process (HSMP), in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the whole diagnosis method.",2019,IEEE Access
Sparse Logistic Regression with Logical Features,"Modeling interactions in regression models poses both computational as well as statistical challenges: the computational resources and the amount of data required to solve them increases sharply with the size of the problem. We focus on logistic regression with categorical variables and propose a method for learning dependencies that are expressed as general Boolean formulas. The computational and statistical challenges are solved by applying a technique called transformed Lasso, which involves a matrix transformation of the original covariates. We compare the method to an earlier related method, LogicReg, and show that our method scales better in terms of the number of covariates as well as the order and complexity of the interactions.",2016,
Prognostic miRNA classifier in early-stage mycosis fungoides: development and validation in a Danish nationwide study.,"Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most frequent form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The disease often takes an indolent course, but in approximately one-third of the patients, the disease progresses to an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. At the time of diagnosis, it is impossible to predict which patients develop severe disease and are in need of aggressive treatment. Accordingly, we investigated the prognostic potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) at the time of diagnosis in MF. Using a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction platform, we analyzed miRNA expression in diagnostic skin biopsies from 154 Danish patients with early-stage MF. The patients were subdivided into a discovery cohort (n = 82) and an independent validation cohort (n = 72). The miRNA classifier was built using a LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) Cox regression to predict progression-free survival (PFS). We developed a 3-miRNA classifier, based on miR-106b-5p, miR-148a-3p, and miR-338-3p, which successfully separated patients into high-risk and low-risk groups of disease progression. PFS was significantly different between these groups in both the discovery cohort and the validation cohort. The classifier was stronger than existing clinical prognostic factors and remained a strong independent prognostic tool after stratification and adjustment for these factors. Importantly, patients in the high-risk group had a significantly reduced overall survival. The 3-miRNA classifier is an effective tool to predict disease progression of early-stage MF at the time of diagnosis. The classifier adds significant prognostic value to existing clinical prognostic factors and may facilitate more individualized treatment of these patients.",2018,Blood
Learning the Network Structure of Heterogeneous Data via Pairwise Exponential Markov Random Fields,"Markov random fields (MRFs) are a useful tool for modeling relationships present in large and high-dimensional data. Often, this data comes from various sources and can have diverse distributions, for example a combination of numerical, binary, and categorical variables. Here, we define the pairwise exponential Markov random field (PE-MRF), an approach capable of modeling exponential family distributions in heterogeneous domains. We develop a scalable method of learning the graphical structure across the variables by solving a regularized approximated maximum likelihood problem. Specifically, we first derive a tractable upper bound on the log-partition function. We then use this upper bound to derive the group graphical lasso, a generalization of the classic graphical lasso problem to heterogeneous domains. To solve this problem, we develop a fast algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We also prove that our estimator is sparsistent, with guaranteed recovery of the true underlying graphical structure, and that it has a polynomially faster runtime than the current state-of-the-art method for learning such distributions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world examples demonstrate that our approach is both eï¬ƒcient and accurate at uncovering the structure of heterogeneous data.",2017,Proceedings of machine learning research
Statistical inference in sparse high-dimensional additive models.,"In this paper we discuss the estimation of a nonparametric component $f_1$ of a nonparametric additive model $Y=f_1(X_1) + ...+ f_q(X_q) + \epsilon$. We allow the number $q$ of additive components to grow to infinity and we make sparsity assumptions about the number of nonzero additive components. We compare this estimation problem with that of estimating $f_1$ in the oracle model $Z= f_1(X_1) + \epsilon$, for which the additive components $f_2,\dots,f_q$ are known. We construct a two-step presmoothing-and-resmoothing estimator of $f_1$ and state finite-sample bounds for the difference between our estimator and some smoothing estimators $\hat f_1^{\text{(oracle)}}$ in the oracle model. In an asymptotic setting these bounds can be used to show asymptotic equivalence of our estimator and the oracle estimators; the paper thus shows that, asymptotically, under strong enough sparsity conditions, knowledge of $f_2,\dots,f_q$ has no effect on estimation accuracy. Our first step is to estimate $f_1$ with an undersmoothed estimator based on near-orthogonal projections with a group Lasso bias correction. We then construct pseudo responses $\hat Y$ by evaluating a debiased modification of our undersmoothed estimator of $f_1$ at the design points. In the second step the smoothing method of the oracle estimator $\hat f_1^{\text{(oracle)}}$ is applied to a nonparametric regression problem with responses $\hat Y$ and covariates $X_1$. Our mathematical exposition centers primarily on establishing properties of the presmoothing estimator. We present simulation results demonstrating close-to-oracle performance of our estimator in practical applications.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Establishment of segmentational data set of larynx based on Chinese visible human,"Objective To establish a digital segmentational data set of larynx based on Chinese visible human (CVH). Methods Magnetic lasso and polygon tools of Photoshop were used to segment the small organs and structures of larynx of CVH to establish the segmentational data set of larynx. After conversion of the image format, the segmentational structures were extracted automatically with Thresholding Method and presented 3-D visualized, and then were checked up by its result of 3D reconstruction with Amira 4.1 software. Results Many small structures of larynx were segmentated, such as laryngeal cartilage, laryngeal muscles, vocal cords and so on. Then the segmentational data set of larynx based on CVH was established, which can be used to 3-D reconstruction accurately. Conclusion The segmentational data set of larynx is accurate and integrated, which is helpful to establish the elaborate model of larynx and can provide the method of color image segmentation.",2008,
Forecasting Time Series Water Levels on Mekong River Using Machine Learning Models,"Forecasting water levels on Mekong river is an important problem needed to be studied for flood warning. In this paper, we investigate the application to forecasting of daily water levels at Thakhek station on Mekong river using machine learning models such as LASSO, Random Forests and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Experimental results showed that SVR was able to achieve feasible results, the mean absolute error of SVR is 0.486(m) while the acceptable error of a flood forecast model required by the Mekong River Commission is between 0.5(m) and 0.75(m).",2015,2015 Seventh International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE)
"Prokaryotic diversity in a Tunisian hypersaline lake, Chott El Jerid","AbstractProkaryotic diversity was investigated in a Tunisian salt lake, Chott El Jerid, by quantitative real-time PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting methods targeting the 16S rRNA gene and culture-dependent methods. Two different samples S1-10 and S2-10 were taken from under the salt crust of Chott El Jerid in the dry season. DGGE analysis revealed that bacterial sequences were related to Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, unclassified bacteria, and Deinococcus-Thermus phyla. Anaerobic fermentative and sulfate-reducing bacteria were also detected in this ecosystem. Within the domain archaea, all sequences were affiliated to Euryarchaeota phylum. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of bacteria was 5Â Ã—Â 106 DNA copies gâˆ’1 whereas archaea varied between 5Â Ã—Â 105 and 106 DNA copies gâˆ’1 in these samples. Eight anaerobic halophilic fermentative bacterial strains were isolated and affiliated with the species Halanaerobium alcaliphilum, Halanaerobium saccharolyticum, and Sporohalobacter salinus. These data showed an abundant and diverse microbial community detected in the hypersaline thalassohaline environment of Chott El Jerid.

"Hydrochemistry and hydrogen sulfide generating processes in the Malm aquifer, Bavarian Molasse Basin, Germany","Knowledge about the hydrochemical conditions of deep groundwater is crucial for the design and operation of geothermal facilities. In this study, the hydrochemical heterogeneity of the groundwaters in the Malm aquifer, Germany, is assessed, and reasons for the extraordinarily high H2S concentrations in the central part of the Bavarian Molasse Basin are proposed. Samples were taken at 16 sites, for a total of 37 individual wells, to analyze cations, anions, gas loading and composition. The hydrochemical characteristics of the Malm groundwater in the center of the Molasse Basin are rather heterogeneous. Although the groundwater in the central basin is dominated by meteoric waters, there is a significant infiltration of saline water from higher strata. Care has to be taken in the interpretation of data from geothermal sites, as effects of chemical stimulation of the boreholes may not be fully removed before the final analyses. The distribution of H2S in the gas phase is correlated to the gas loading of the water which increases in the central basin. Temperatures, isotopic data and the sulfur mass balance indicate that H2S in the central basin is related to thermochemical sulfate reduction (south of Munich) and bacterial sulfate reduction (north of Munich).RÃ©sumÃ©La connaissance de lâ€™Ã©tat hydrochimique des eaux souterraines profondes est cruciale pour la conception et lâ€™exploitation des installations gÃ©othermales.

To this end we have substituted the straight running race test and simultaneous filming with a high-speed film camera, the classic procedure for this type of analysis, for a onelegged race on mats filmed with a home video camera. Information is obtained by directly projecting from the video monitor to the digitalizing table. The statiscal analysis of the established standard modifications, the one-iegged race and the video recording has shown their validity. It was concluded that the two standard modifications made, the one-legged race and filming with a video camera, are valid. The average maximum dynamic pronation is 14,8Â° Â± 5,21 in the first contact and 20Â° Â± 6,23 in the second. There is no correlation between the static and dynamic pronation (r = 0,046). However, there is a good correlation between the values measured dynamically in each contact of the test. There is also a correlation (r = 0,51) between the specific training of the action of the foot during the race (race technique) and the degree of pronation found. catalaL'objectiu del nostre treball es avaluar el moviment de pronacio dinamica del turmell en joves escolars de 14 a 18 anys.

"Frequency of methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates in Khartoum State, Sudan","Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have emerged as an important cause of nosocomial and community-acquired infections ranging from mild to severe life-threatening infections. Therefore, a reliable detection of such strains is required for effective treatment. Objectives: To determine the frequency and the antibiogram of MRSA among different clinical isolates. Study Design: A cross-sectional, descriptive study. Materials and Methods: Standard bacteriological methods, disk diffusion and PCR were performed to determine the frequency of MRSA among different clinical isolates. Results: The overall results showed 96/210 (45.7%) of isolates were MRSA mostly recovered from wounds and blood stream. High percentage was detected in hospitalassociated (HA) strains (64.2%) rather than community (CA) (37.1%) ( P -value < 0.001). From the generated Antibiogram, Co-trimoxazole was the most active (80.2%), while Penicillin was the least one (6.2%). Conclusion: As MRSA strains were mostly isolated from Hospitals, clinicians should be aware of such burden strains. Local frequency investigation of MRSA is recommended for perfect diagnosis and treatment. Keywords: MRSA, S. aureus , mecA, Sudan",2018,Sudan journal of medical sciences
"Thalassolituus oleivorans gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel marine bacterium that obligately utilizes hydrocarbons.","An aerobic, heterotrophic, Gram-negative, curved bacterial strain, designated MIL-1T, was isolated by extinction dilution from an n-tetradecane enrichment culture that was established from sea water/sediment samples collected in the harbour of Milazzo, Italy. In the primary enrichment, the isolate formed creamy-white, medium-sized colonies on the surface of the agar. The isolate did not grow in the absence of NaCl; growth was optimal at 2.7% NaCl. Only a narrow spectrum of organic compounds, including aliphatic hydrocarbons (C7-C20), their oxidized derivatives and acetate, were used as growth substrates. The isolate was not able to grow under denitrifying conditions. The DNA G+C content and genome size of strain MIL-1T were estimated to be 53.2 mol% and 2.2 Mbp, respectively. The major cellular and phospholipid fatty acids were palmitoleic, palmitic and oleic acids (33.5, 29.5 and 11.0% and 18, 32 and 31%, respectively). 3-hydroxy lauric acid was the only hydroxy fatty acid detected. Thirteen different compounds that belonged to two types of phospholipid (phosphatidylethylamine and phosphatidylglycerol) were identified. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that this isolate represents a distinct phyletic lineage within the gamma-Proteobacteria and has about 94.4% sequence similarity to Oceanobacter kriegii (the closest bacterial species with a validly published name). The deduced protein sequence of the putative alkane hydrolase, AlkB, of strain MIL-1T is related to the corresponding enzymes of Alcanivorax borkumensis and Pseudomonas oleovorans (81 and 80% similarity, respectively). On the basis of the analyses performed, Thalassolituus oleivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. is described.

Earlier sex change in infected individuals of the protogynous reef fish,"Sex allocation theory for sequential hermaphrodites predicts the size at which an individual should change sex, given the different relationships between individual size and reproductive success in the two sexes. We studied a host-parasite system where the myxozoan Kudoa ovivora infects the ovaries of the reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum, a protogynous sequential hermaphrodite. The parasite sporulates in the hostâ€™s eggs and renders them infertile. It is thus expected to reduce the femaleâ€™s reproductive success, and could thereby influence host sex change. We present data from marked fish we observed in the field over 4 months. The data suggest that females infected with Kudoa ovivora have a lower reproductive success, change sex earlier and at a smaller size than uninfected females. These results are in agreement with predictions from sex allocation theory, and provide the first example of a possible parasitic influence on the sex allocation of its host.",2003,
Multiple Kernel Learning with High Order Kernels,"Previous Multiple Kernel Learning approaches (MKL) employ different kernels by their linear combination. Though some improvements have been achieved over methods using single kernel, the advantages of employing multiple kernels for machine learning are far from being fully developed. In this paper, we propose to use â€œhigh order kernelsâ€ to enhance the learning of MKL when a set of original kernels are given. High order kernels are generated by the products of real power of the original kernels. We incorporate the original kernels and high order kernels into a unified localized kernel logistic regression model. To avoid over-fitting, we apply group LASSO regularization to the kernel coefficients of each training sample. Experiments on image classification prove that our approach outperforms many of the existing MKL approaches.",2010,2010 20th International Conference on Pattern Recognition
Do Local and Global Factors Impact the Emerging Marketsâ€™s Sovereign Yield Curves? Evidence from a Data-Rich Environment,"This paper investigates the relation between yield curve and macroeconomic factors for ten emerging sovereign bond markets using the sample from January 2006 to April 2019. To this end, the diffusion indices obtained under four categories (global variables, inflation, domestic financial variables, and economic activity) are incorporated by estimating dynamic panel data regressions together with the yield curve factors. Besides, in order to capture dynamic interaction between yield curve and macroeconomic/financial factors, a panel VAR analysis based on the system GMM approach is utilized. Empirical results suggest that the level factor responds to shocks originated from inflation, domestic financial variables and global variables. Furthermore, the slope factor is affected by shocks in global variables, and the curvature factor appears to be influenced by domestic financial variables. We also show that macroeconomic/financial factors captures significant predictive information over yield curve factors by running individual country factor-augmented predictive regressions and variable selection algorithms such ridge regression, LASSO and Elastic Net. Our findings have important implications for policymakers and fund managers by explaining the underlying forces of movements in the yield curve and forecasting accurately dynamics of yield curve factors.",2020,

Learning with Data Adaptive Features,"Abstract : It is frequently observed that the dimension of inputs is much larger than the sample size. Examples are image construction, microarray data, data mining etc. In such cases, standard learning methods either are not applicable or perform badly. Also, identifying a small subset of important features, which discriminate outputs, becomes an important subject. Hence, good learning algorithms with high dimensional inputs should provides a classification rule which not only yields high accuracy but also has an ability of identifying few important features. Apparently, there are two popularly used such algorithms. One is decision trees and the other is LASSO. The objective of this research is to develop new algorithms for decision tree and LASSO for improving computational power, prediction accuracy, and ability of detecting significant features.",2006,
Erratum to: Ultrahigh dimensional variable selection through the penalized maximum trimmed likelihood estimator,"The penalized maximum likelihood estimator (PMLE) has been widely used for variable selection in high-dimensional data. Various penalty functions have been employed for this purpose, e.g., Lasso, weighted Lasso, or smoothly clipped absolute deviations. However, the PMLE can be very sensitive to outliers in the data, especially to outliers in the covariates (leverage points). In order to overcome this disadvantage, the usage of the penalized maximum trimmed likelihood estimator (PMTLE) is proposed to estimate the unknown parameters in a robust way. The computation of the PMTLE takes advantage of the same technology as used for PMLE but here the estimation is based on subsamples only. The breakdown point properties of the PMTLE are discussed using the notion of $$d$$ -fullness. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated in a simulation study for the classical multiple linear and Poisson linear regression models.

Feasibility of placing a modified fully covered self-expandable metal stent above the papilla to minimize stent-induced bile duct injury in patients with refractory benign biliary strictures (with videos).,"BACKGROUND
Endoscopic placement of fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMS) has been attempted to manage benign biliary strictures, but currently available FCSEMSs may be associated with unintended complications, including de novo strictures, in patients with normal life expectancy.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the feasibility of an intraductally placed modified FCSEMS to minimize stent-induced bile duct injury in patients with benign biliary strictures.


DESIGN
Prospective observational clinical feasibility study.


SETTING
Tertiary-care academic center.


PATIENTS
This study involved 21 patients with symptomatic benign biliary strictures in whom conventional endoscopic management failed.


INTERVENTION
Strictured segments were 15 mm above the ampulla of Vater. The modified FCSEMS has convex margins, a lasso, and an anti-migrating waist on the central portion. Stents were placed entirely above the papilla and removed after 3 to 5 months.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS
Success, complications, removability, midterm outcome.


RESULTS
FCSEMSs were successfully placed inside the bile duct in all patients. No episodes of pancreatitis, cholangitis, or sepsis were noted during the stenting period. Stent migration occurred in 4 patients (19.0%), but 3 were asymptomatic during follow-up. All stents were removed successfully with rat-tooth forceps without complications. Post-stenting cholangiograms showed improvement of strictures in 20 of 21 patients, without de novo focal stricture. The clinical success rate was 95.2%, with one recurrent stricture.


LIMITATIONS
The small number and lack of comparison with other types of FCSEMSs.


CONCLUSION
Temporary intraductal placement of a newly modified FCSEMS effectively improved strictures and prevented potential stent-induced complications in patients with benign biliary strictures. Controlled large-scale trials are needed to confirm the long-term efficacy.",2012,Gastrointestinal endoscopy
A new SMOS sea surface salinity retrieval method,"Sea surface roughness and foam have great influence on the retrieval accuracy of sea surface salinity (SSS) from satellite measured L-band brightness temperature (TB). A lot of work need to be done to improve the SSS retrieval accuracy especially using the forward model to reduce the error induced by sea surface roughness and foam. In this paper, seven factors, whitecap coverage, significant wave height (SWH), wave steepness, wavelength, sea surface temperature (SST), foam thickness, Water droplets density, their second-order items, and interaction items are selected as our model input candidates, and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operation (LASSO) method is used for critical factor selection. As a result, two factors, SST and SWH, are carefully picked up to establish the new model to calculate the TB variants with quadratic curve regression formulas. The model shows that the mean absolute error (MAE) is 1.09psu and the root mean square (RMSE) is 1.70psu compared with Argo SSS data, in the meanwhile, the MEA of SMOS L2 SSS is 1.69psu and the RMSE is 2.48psu respectively. Results show that the new model can improve the retrieval accuracy for SMOS SSS measurements.",2017,2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
An improved multiple LASSO model for steady-state visual evoked potential detection,"Improving the classification accuracy in brainâ€“computer interface (BCI) with a short data length is important to increase the BCI systemâ€™s information transfer rate. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) has been examined to be an effective way to detect the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) signals with a short time window. In this paper, an improved multiple LASSO model for SSVEP detection is proposed, which can process multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals without electrode selection. EEG data from twelve healthy volunteers were used to test the improved multiple LASSO model. Compared with the traditional LASSO model, the improved multiple LASSO model gives a significantly better performance with multichannel EEG data.",2017,
Engaging needles: a simple technique for arthroscopic side-to-side rotator cuff repair.,"We present a simplified technique for the side-to-side arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. The instruments required for this technique are a 45 degrees Suture Lasso (SL; Arthrex, Naples, FL) and a 17F spinal needle (SN). With the arthroscope in the lateral portal, the SL is inserted through the posterior cannulas to grab healthy tissue at the posterior margin of the cuff. Through the anterior cannulas or through a skin puncture, the SN is inserted to catch healthy tissue at the anterior margin. Once both instruments are through the tissues, we manipulate them to make their tips converge. Because the SN diameter is small, it is very easy to engage its tip into the SL tip. Once engaged, a No. 1 PDS monofilament suture is easily passed through both instruments. When the suture comes out of the SL handle, both instruments can be pulled out, leaving the suture in place. Using a suture retriever clamp, the sutures are retrieved through a cannula for knot tying. This technique can be repeated as many times as necessary to place enough sutures in a side-to-side fashion to achieve the repair.",2006,Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association
Devenir Inmortal. La CrÃ­tica De Quentin Meillassoux a La FilosofÃ­a De La Inmanencia De Gilles Deleuze,"This article makes a brief presentation of the critique of Gilles Deleuzeâ€™s philosophy given by the French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux, initiatior of the so-called speculative realism (one of the names for the new realism that currently spreads over the philosophical scope). The latter critiques the insufficient character of the conception of immanence held by the former. Firstly, I give an account of the arguments offered by Meillassoux, and, then I reflect on the discussion about immanence regarding the problem of meaning and the limits of atheism, as a general feature of modern thought.",2016,
Behaviour of temperate and sub-tropical reef fishes towards a stationary SCUBA diver,"Using remote underwater stereoâ€“video systems we examined fish behaviour towards a stationary SCUBA diver at temperate (Rottnest Island) and sub-tropical (Houtman Abrolhos Islands) reefs in Western Australia. Changes in species richness, relative abundance, fish length, and the mean distance of individual fish from stereoâ€“video cameras, in the presence and absence of a SCUBA diver, were assessed to infer changes in behaviour. Results show that a stationary SCUBA diver may obtain accurate measures of species richness and of the composition of fish assemblages in an area. However, the usefulness of these measures to reflect changes in fish behaviour appears limited as responses of fish towards the stationary SCUBA diver were highly species specific. Several species differed in their mean relative abundance (Heterodontus portusjacksoni, Coris auricularis, Thalassoma lunare), length (Ophthalmolepsis lineolatus, C. auricularis), and the distance to which they would approach the stereoâ€“video systems (Kyphosus sy...",2007,Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology
Quantum annealing versus classical machine learning applied to a simplified computational biology problem,"Transcription factors regulate gene expression, but how these proteins recognize and specifically bind to their DNA targets is still debated. Machine learning models are effective means to reveal interaction mechanisms. Here we studied the ability of a quantum machine learning approach to classify and rank binding affinities. Using simplified data sets of a small number of DNA sequences derived from actual binding affinity experiments, we trained a commercially available quantum annealer to classify and rank transcription factor binding. The results were compared to state-of-the-art classical approaches for the same simplified data sets, including simulated annealing, simulated quantum annealing, multiple linear regression, LASSO, and extreme gradient boosting. Despite technological limitations, we find a slight advantage in classification performance and nearly equal ranking performance using the quantum annealer for these fairly small training data sets. Thus, we propose that quantum annealing might be an effective method to implement machine learning for certain computational biology problems.Quantum annealing: Solving a biological model with quantum machine learningA quantum algorithm has competitive performance with several standard machine learning methods for classifying and ranking binding affinities of gene-regulating molecules to DNA. Transcription factor proteins play a key role in controlling gene expression by attaching to DNA, but constructing a quantitative model to predict the binding strength is difficult. Richard Li and colleagues from the University of Southern California compared the performance of classical machine learning with a quantum learning algorithm implemented on a quantum annealing processor. While traditional classical protocols worked best when large training sets were used, the annealing approach outperformed them with smaller datasets. These results indicate that, even while a general speedup compared to classical computing is yet to be established, quantum annealing processors may help improve machine learning approaches to practical problems where training data are scarce.",2018,npj Quantum Information
Ranking Function Synthesis for Linear Lasso Programs,"The scope of this work is the constraint-based synthesis of termination arguments for the restricted class of programs called linear lasso programs. A termination argument consists of a ranking function as well as a set of supporting invariants. 
We extend existing methods in several ways. First, we use Motzkin's Transposition Theorem instead of Farkas' Lemma. This allows us to consider linear lasso programs that can additionally contain strict inequalities. Existing methods are restricted to non-strict inequalities and equalities. 
Second, we consider several kinds of ranking functions: affine-linear, piecewise and lexicographic ranking functions. Moreover, we present a novel kind of ranking function called multiphase ranking function which proceeds through a fixed number of phases such that for each phase, there is an affine-linear ranking function. As an abstraction to the synthesis of specific ranking functions, we introduce the notion ranking function template. This enables us to handle all ranking functions in a unified way. 
Our method relies on non-linear algebraic constraint solving as a subroutine which is known to scale poorly to large problems. As a mitigation we formalize an assessment of the difficulty of our constraints and present an argument why they are of an easier kind than general non-linear constraints. 
We prove our method to be complete: if there is a termination argument of the form specified by the given ranking function template with a fixed number of affine-linear supporting invariants, then our method will find a termination argument. 
To our knowledge, the approach we propose is the most powerful technique of synthesis-based discovery of termination arguments for linear lasso programs and encompasses and enhances several methods having been proposed thus far.",2014,ArXiv
Generating Probabilities From Numerical Weather Forecasts by Logistic Regression,"Logistic models are studied as a tool to convert output from numerical weather forecasting systems (deterministic and ensemble) into probability forecasts for binary events. A logistic model obtains by putting the logarithmic odds ratio equal to a linear combination of the inputs. As any statistical model, logistic models will suffer from over-fitting if the number of inputs is comparable to the number of forecast instances. Computational approaches to avoid over-fitting by regularisation are discussed, and efficient approaches for model assessment and selection are presented. A logit version of the so called lasso, which is originally a linear tool, is discussed. In lasso models, less important inputs are identified and discarded, thereby providing an efficient and automatic model reduction procedure. For this reason, lasso models are particularly appealing for diagnostic purposes.",2009,arXiv: Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics
Safety of horticultural and livestock products in two medium-sized cities of Mali and Burkina Faso,"Despite their contribution to food security, animal products and vegetables from urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) often raise public health and environmental concerns, given high use of agro-chemicals, organic fertilizers and wastewater. This study exemplarily investigated contamination of selected horticultural and livestock products (milk and irrigated lettuce with a potentially high microbiological contamination; and tomato and cabbage on which various pesticides were used) from Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) and Sikasso (Mali). Samples of irrigation water, organic fertilizer and lettuce were collected from six gardens; cabbage and tomato samples were collected from 15 gardens, and samples of raw and curdled milk were collected from six dairy herds in February, May, and November 2009. Thermo-tolerant coliforms and Escherichia coli in irrigation water significantly exceeded WHO recommendations for unrestricted irrigation of vegetables consumed raw. Microbial contamination of lettuce at garden level and market place in Bobo Dioulasso, and at garden level in Sikasso was higher than at Sikasso market (P<0.05). Pesticide residues were detected in only one cabbage and one tomato sample and were below the maximum residue limit for consumption. Counts of thermo-tolerant coliforms and E. coli were higher in curdled than in raw milk (P<0.05). Given the differences in microbial load between produce of different origin and subsequent stages along value chains, there is scope for low-cost improvement of the safety of UPA smallholdersâ€™ products. However, studies of higher spatial and temporal resolution along all stages of the value chains for these products are needed in order to derive respective recommendations.

Status and Fertility Among Urban Women in Burkina Faso,A study performed in Bobo-Dioulasso a small commerical town in southwest Burkina Faso showed that reproduction dominates womens existence. The sample of women surveyed mostly Moslem with some Christians and animists was drawn from a group sampled in an infant mortality study. Uneducated women showed an almost proud fatalism regarding their own fertility and an ignorance of reproductive physiology. Fewer than 30% of young women have the benefit of any education whatsoever and education is the most negative affector of fertility. Economic roles for women have been essential but never incompatible with raising of children. Rural women farm urban women farm and engage in market activities and even salaried labor thanks to liberal maternity leaves and breastfeeding breaks. Children are introduced to household and other duties early. Fairly universal mothers incomes buy clothing and special foods and medicines for children. Fathers are as autonomous and pay for housing food and schooling. Wives enter a husbands household in subservience and acquire status through children a phenomenon which might counterbalance the long-term physical and nutritional drain of childbearing. Husbands home role is minimal; they have little to contribute that is not economic. The husband is the ultimate household head polygyny is common and relationships between spouses are distant a factor which seems to positively affect fertility. The effect of religion and culture is a situation in which a womans only source of status is through childbearing. For development to have any hope of affecting fertility this situation must be changed. Development in BObo-Dioulasso and similar places will need to be highly female-oriented.,1985,International Family Planning Perspectives
Obervations on the Induction of Position Effect Variegation of Euchromatic Genes in Drosophila melanogaster,"In the T(l;2)d0r""""'~ translocation, the 1A-2B7-8 segment of the X chromosome is brought to the vicinity of 2R-chromosome heterochromatin resulting in position effect variegation of dor, BR-C and more distal genes, as well as compaction of chromatin in this segment. By irradiation of T(I;2)dorUar7, nine reversions (rev) to a normal phenotype were recovered. In two cases (rev27, rev226), the 1A2B7-8 section is relocated to the 19A region of the X chromosome, forming free duplications (1A2B7-8/19A-20F-X-het). Modifiers of position effect do not change the normal expression of the BRC and dor genes in these duplications. In five reversions (rev3, rev40, rev60, revl67, revI75), free duplications have formed from the 1A-2B7-8 fragment and X chromosome heterochromatin. In these rearrangements, modifiers of position effect (low temperature, removal of Y and 2R-chromosome heterochromatin and a genetic enhancer (E-var(3)201) induce position-effect again. Two reversions (rev45 and r e v l l 0 ) are associated with additional inversions in the original dor"""""" chromosomes. The inversions relocate part of the heterochromatin adjacent to the 1A-2B7-8 section into new positions. In T(1;2)d0r'""~', position-effect is seen in the 2B7-8-7A element as compaction spreading from 2B7-8 proximally in some cases as far as the 5D region. Thus, in rev45 the pattern of euchromatin compaction is reciprocal to that of the initial dormr7 strain. Apparently, it is due to the same variegation-evoking center near the 2R centromere in both cases. In all nine revertants, weakening or complete disappearance of the position-effect is observed despite retention of the 20kb heterochromatic segment adjacent to the 1A-2B7-8 region. Thus, a 20-kb heterochromatic sequence does not inactivate euchromatin joined to it. P OSITION effect variegation (PEV) in Drosophila results from inactivation of euchromatic genes placed next to pericentric heterochromatin by chromosome r arrangements (reviews: LEWIS 1950; BAKER 1968; SPOFFORD 1976; HENIKOFF 1990; TARTOF and BREMER 1990; ZHIMULEV 1993). The inactivation is associated with a heterochromatin-like compaction f the adjacent euchromatic segment MULEV et al. 1986, 1988, 1989; BELYAEVA and ZHIMULEV 1991). At present, the data favor the hypothesis that heterochromatization of the euchromatic loci under position effect is caused by heterochromatinspecific proteins. One of the proteins (HPl), encoded by Su-uar(3)205 (EISSENBERG et al. 1990) appears in nuclei during early embryogenesis (JAMES et al. 1989) just at the time when the heterochromatin s forming, as revealed by C-staining (VLASSOVA et al. 1991). In position effect, compaction of euchromatin also occurs during the first hours of embryogenesis, as evidenced by temperature sensitivity studies (HARTMANN-GOLDSTEIN 1967; ZHIMULEV et al. 1988). Recently, the presence of HPl has been demonstrated in compact euchromatic regions inactivated by position effect (BELYAEVA et al. 1993). (SCHULTZ 1965; HARTMANN-GOLDSTEIN 1967; ZHIGenetics 133: 231-242 (May, 1993) I t is well known that not all heterochromatic rearrangements induce PEV (DEMEREC 1 94 1 ; SPOFFORD 1976; ZHIMULEV 1993). In experiments with revertants of PEV, it has been shown that a 3-kb heterochromatic sequence proximal to the euchromatin-heterochromatin junction does not result in inactivation of euchromatin. These data suggest that special compaction domains exist in heterochromatin with centers of inactivation located some distance from the euchromatin-heterochromatin junction (TARTOF, HOBBS and JONES 1984). However, question remains concerning the distance between the eu-heterochromatin junction and heterochromatic sequences inducing inactivation ( i e . , what is the size of the compaction domains?). Moreover, the specificity of the heterochromatic sequences inducing compaction is unknown. In the present study we obtain new information about the heterochromatic regions affecting gene inactivation by analysis of revertants of the position effect for genes in the 2B region associated with T(1;2)dorUar7. T(1;2)dorUar7 is a complex chromosome rearrangement containing many breaks, one of which occurs in the 2B7-8 band (Figure 1) joining the 2B78 region with the most proximal section of 2R-heterochromatin.

Bellezza e UtilitÃ . Prove di integrazione nelle azioni per il paesaggio. Beauty and Utility. Their Integration in the Actions for the Landscape,"Rarities and Beauty are the main criteria for the acknowledgement and the conservation of the heritage and the landscape from the very first Italian protection laws (L.1089/ 39, L.1497/39). Giovannoni and Croce contributed to the affirmation of these interpretative categories of the landscape as an aesthetic good destined to public enjoyment. The utility of the landscape was exclusively connected to visual enjoyment. This interpretation will be extended from the Galasso Law that promotes the utility of the landscape for the conservation of the biodiversity and the ecological functionality of the territory. European Landscape Convention is innovative for the Italian protection of culture because it enforces the role of the landscape as a multidimensional pattern of historical, cultural, ecological, economic values and as an expression of the local identity, diversity and as a resource for development. In this direction, the Italian Heritage and the Landscape Code (2004 and 2006) extends the object of the protection and the landscape planning to the entire territory by introducing a new dimension for the implementation in terms of projects and planning. There are still many differences in the Convention that risks weaking the challenge aimed at promoting the integration of the protection, planning, management and the valorisation of the landscape pattern",2006,
High Dimensional Regression with Binary Coefficients. Estimating Squared Error and a Phase Transtition,"We consider a sparse linear regression model Y=X\beta^{*}+W where X has a Gaussian entries, W is the noise vector with mean zero Gaussian entries, and \beta^{*} is a binary vector with support size (sparsity) k. Using a novel conditional second moment method we obtain a tight up to a multiplicative constant approximation of the optimal squared error \min_{\beta}\|Y-X\beta\|_{2}, where the minimization is over all k-sparse binary vectors \beta. The approximation reveals interesting structural properties of the underlying regression problem. In particular, a) We establish that n^*=2k\log p/\log (2k/\sigma^{2}+1) is a phase transition point with the following ""all-or-nothing"" property. When n exceeds n^{*}, (2k)^{-1}\|\beta_{2}-\beta^*\|_0\approx 0, and when n is below n^{*}, (2k)^{-1}\|\beta_{2}-\beta^*\|_0\approx 1, where \beta_2 is the optimal solution achieving the smallest squared error. With this we prove that n^{*} is the asymptotic threshold for recovering \beta^* information theoretically. b) We compute the squared error for an intermediate problem \min_{\beta}\|Y-X\beta\|_{2} where minimization is restricted to vectors \beta with \|\beta-\beta^{*}\|_0=2k \zeta, for \zeta\in [0,1]. We show that a lower bound part \Gamma(\zeta) of the estimate, which corresponds to the estimate based on the first moment method, undergoes a phase transition at three different thresholds, namely n_{\text{inf,1}}=\sigma^2\log p, which is information theoretic bound for recovering \beta^* when k=1 and \sigma is large, then at n^{*} and finally at n_{\text{LASSO/CS}}. c) We establish a certain Overlap Gap Property (OGP) on the space of all binary vectors \beta when n\le ck\log p for sufficiently small constant c. We conjecture that OGP is the source of algorithmic hardness of solving the minimization problem \min_{\beta}\|Y-X\beta\|_{2} in the regime n",2017,
On the Sample Complexity of Predictive Sparse Coding,"The goal of predictive sparse coding is to learn a representation of examples as sparse linear combinations of elements from a dictionary, such that a learned hypothesis linear in the new representation performs well on a predictive task. Predictive sparse coding algorithms recently have demonstrated impressive performance on a variety of supervised tasks, but their generalization properties have not been studied. We establish the first generalization error bounds for predictive sparse coding, covering two settings: 1) the overcomplete setting, where the number of features k exceeds the original dimensionality d; and 2) the high or infinite-dimensional setting, where only dimension-free bounds are useful. Both learning bounds intimately depend on stability properties of the learned sparse encoder, as measured on the training sample. Consequently, we first present a fundamental stability result for the LASSO, a result characterizing the stability of the sparse codes with respect to perturbations to the dictionary. In the overcomplete setting, we present an estimation error bound that decays as \tilde{O}(sqrt(d k/m)) with respect to d and k. In the high or infinite-dimensional setting, we show a dimension-free bound that is \tilde{O}(sqrt(k^2 s / m)) with respect to k and s, where s is an upper bound on the number of non-zeros in the sparse code for any training data point.",2012,ArXiv
Cluster detection diagnostics for small area health data: with reference to evaluation of local likelihood models.,"The focus of this paper is the development of a range of cluster detection diagnostics that can be used to assess the degree to which a clustering method recovers the true clustering behaviour of small area data. The diagnostics proposed range from individual region specific diagnostics to neighbourhood diagnostics, and assume either individual region risk as focus, or concern areas of maps defined to be clustered and the recovery ability of methods. A simulation-based comparison is made between a small set of count data models: local likelihood, BYM and Lawson and Clark. It is found that local likelihood has good performance across a range of criteria when a CAR prior is assumed for the lasso parameter.",2006,Statistics in medicine
"Re-examination of the palynological content of the Lower Cretaceous deposits of Angeac, Charente, south-west France: Age, palaeoenvironment and taxonomic determinations","Further to the work published by Neraudeau et al. six years ago, palynological matter recovered from the lignitic bone bed of Angeac in Charente (south-west France) has been re-examined in order to provide more evidence of its age, the previous Hauterivianâ€“Barremian interpretation being regarded as controversial. The samples come from four sedimentological units, An2â€“An5, which together yielded an assemblage of 34 species, taxonomically dominated by palaeoecologically significant lygodiaceous verrucate spores, including eight species attributable to the genus Concavissimisporites and three species of Trilobosporites. A few bisaccate pollen grains, including Vitreisporites pallidus, have been recovered, but the gymnospermous pollen spectrum is clearly dominated by the cheirolepidiaceous genus Classopollis, its abundance diminishing progressively upwards from units An4 to An2. The great abundance and diversity of verrucate forms, along with the presence of other spores typical of Lower Cretaceous deposits, such as Aequitriradites verrucosus, and the scarcity of specimens referable to Cicatricosisporites, render this assemblage most similar to those of the Hastings Group of southern England, and the Buckeberg Formation in north-western Germany. The time of deposition is, therefore, more likely to have been Berriasianâ€“Valanginian rather than Hauterivianâ€“Barremian, as previously stated. The associated small assemblage of megaspores is consistent with this determination. Except for Trilobosporites and Concavissimisporites, the use of several other genera commonly applied to Mesozoic verrucate spores, such as Converrucosisporites and Impardecispora, is considered unnecessary. To support this assertion, a Principal Components Analysis has been carried out on 120 verrucate spores from sedimentological units An2â€“4, taking into account ten morphological variables. The results show that specimens attributable to Trilobosporites are well be separated from the main cluster, which corresponds to Concavissimisporites, underlining the futility of using more than two genera for the species concerned.",2018,Cretaceous Research
Radiomic features of pretreatment MRI could identify T stage in patients with rectal cancer: Preliminary findings,"BACKGROUND
Recent studies have shown that magnetic resonance (MR) radiomic analysis is feasible and has some value in identifying tumor characteristics, but there are few data regarding the role of MR-based radiomic features in rectal cancer.


PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to determine whether radiomic features extracted from T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI) can identify pathological features in rectal cancer.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective study.


POPULATION/SUBJECTS
A cohort comprising 119 rectal cancer patients who underwent surgery between January 2015 and November 2016.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
3.0T, axial high-resolution T2 -weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence.


ASSESSMENT
Patients were classified according to pathological features such as T stage, N stage, perineural invasion, histological grade, lymph-vascular invasion, tumor deposits, and circumferential resection margin (CRM). The whole tumor volume (WTV) was distinguished, and segments were quantified on axial high-resolution T2 WI by a radiologist. A total of 256 radiomic features were extracted.


STATISTICAL TESTS
To achieve reliable results, cluster analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were implemented. In the cluster analysis, the patients were divided into two groups, and chi-square tests were performed to investigate the relationship between the pathological features and the radiomic-based clusters. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the predictability of the model in the LASSO analysis.


RESULTS
The cluster results revealed that patients could be stratified into two groups, and the chi-square test results indicated that the pT stage was correlated with the radiomic feature cluster results (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). The prediction model AUC for the diagnostic T stage was 0.852 (95% confidence interval: 0.677-1; sensitivity: 79.0%, specificity: 82.0%).


DATA CONCLUSION
The use of MRI-derived radiomic features to identify the T stage is feasible in rectal cancer.

"Micropaleontological changes at the Cenomanian- Turonian boundary in the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin, Czech Republic","Initial transgressive Cretaceous deposits of the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin are represented by siliciclastic sediments of the Cenomanian age (Peruc-Korycany Formation with tree members: Peruc, Korycany and Pecinov) and hemipelagic marlstones and limestones of the Turonian age (Bila Hora Formation). Transgressive successions include fluvial, marsh, estuarine, inner shelf and open marine facies assemblages (Cech et al., 2005). Generally, character of calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers and palynological assemblages reflects depositional conditions near the Ce-Tu boundary. Biostratigraphically important angiosperm pollen Complexiopollis vulgaris appears in late middle Cenomanian (A. jukes-brownei Zone) (UlicnÃ½ et al. 1997). Halophyte pollen of Classopollis/Corollina is important component of the coastal marshes. Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides, Spiniferites ramosus becomes the most common types and characterize near shore deposition. The first sparce occurrence of agglutinated foraminifers was recognized in the upper part of the Cenomanian sandstones of Korycany Member. In the inner shelf facies of calcareous clayey glauconitic siltstones of the Pecinov Member mostly agglutinated species and calcareous benthos with sporadic representants of planktonic genera Hedbergella and Whiteinella were found. Stratigraphically important species Gavelinella cenomanica indicates Cenomanian stage of sediments which belong to planktonic interval and partial range zone Whiteinella archaeocretacea (upper part of Upper Cenomanian to the lowermost part of Lower Turonian) sensu Robaszynski & Caron (1995). Lithological changes and low oxygen content of the Pecinov Member are reflected in well-pronounced variation within palynological record. Poor dinocyst assemblage, abundant foraminiferal chitinous linings, scolecodonts (jaw apparatus of worms) and amorphous organic matter characterize the uppermost part. Dinocyst species Epelidosphaeridia spinosa was found together with Praeactinocamax plenus (Upper Cenomanian, M. geslinianum Zone). Upper Cenomanian foraminiferal assemblage with rare occurrence of planktonic species, a low diversity of dinocyst species, relatively frequent acritarchs and prasinophytes and poor nannofossils assemblages with higher numbers of Watznaueria barnesae, Broinsonia signata, and strongly etched specimens, indicate shallow marine conditions at the beginning of transgression (upper part of the Peruc-Korycany Fm.). Influx of abundant nannoflora, very rich, highly diversified dinocyst assemblage supports Turonian transgression and change to neritic conditions. More diverse foraminiferal assemblages with abundance of planktonic keeled type of tests and juvenil specimens with calcareous tests give evidence for conditions of the open sea in the Lower Turonian. These foraminiferal assemblages belong to Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica Zone (Robaszynski & Caron 1995) due to the occurrence of H. helvetica. Also the presence of calcareous benthos as Cassidella tegulata, Frondicularia inversa and agglutinated Gaudryina angustata, G. folium is characteristic for the foraminiferal assembalge of this planktonic zone. The lowermost Turonian is well evidenced by FO Eprolithus octopetalus followed by LO Helenea chiastia and FO Eprolithus moratus. First appearance of nannofossil species Eprolithus moratus coincides with first occurrence of foraminiferal planktonic species Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica in hemipelagic sediments of the Bila Hora Formation. Dinocyst assemblage with increasing gonyaulacean types such as Surculosphaeridium? longifurcatum, Oligosphaeridium complex, Achomosphaera ramulifera, Pervosphaeridium pseudhystrichodinium, Hystrichodinium pulchrum and especially open marine form Pterodinium cingulatum are most abundant. Complexiopollis and Atlantopollis are most common angiosperm pollen in Lower Turonian sediments.",2009,
Robust Biomarker Screening Using Spares Learning Approach for Liver Cancer Prognosis,"LncRNAs, miRNAs, mRNAs, methylation, and proteins exert profound biological functions and are widely applied as prognostic features in liver cancer. This study aims to identify prognostic biomarkersâ€™ signature for liver cancer. Samples with inadequate tumor purity were filtered out and the expression data from different resources were retrieved. The Spares learning approach was applied to select lncRNAs, miRNAs, mRNAs, methylation, and proteinsâ€™ features based on their differentially expressed groups. The LASSO boosting technique was employed for the predictive model construction. A total of 200 lncRNAs, 200 miRNAs, 371 mRNAs, 371 methylations, and 184 proteins were observed to be differentially expressed. Five lncRNAs, 11 miRNAs, 30 mRNAs, 4 methylations, and 3 proteins were selected for further evaluation using the feature elimination technique. The highest accuracy of 89.32% is achieved as a result of training and learning by Spares learning methodology. Final outcomes revealed that 5 lncRNA, 11 miRNA, 30 mRNA, 4 methylation, and 3 protein signatures could be potential biomarkers for the prognosis of liver cancer patients.

"LASSO based building thermal model for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning control","Sophisticated controllers using building models and effects of disturbances are required for saving energy in buildings. Occupancy and climate are the disturbances acting on the building thermal model. This investigation presents a procedure for constructing building thermal model using experiments, simple sensor and least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The thermal model so obtained is simple and can be used to construct model based controllers. Further, the methods leads to a linear model as against the non-linear thermal building models making it easier to design model based controllers. The building model is illustrated on a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) test-bed in a laboratory. Our results show that the LASSO based captures the non-linear disturbances and improves the model accuracy. The obtained results are compared with the actual measurements and least-squares to illustrate the accuracy.",2015,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)"

Massry and Glassock's Textbook of Nephrology,"In an age of instant information flow across webs that penetrate to the remotest corners of the earth, elegant traditional textbooks like the third edition of Massry and Glassock's Textbook of Nephrology continue to fill a need. This they achieve by assembling in one easily accessible place the latest advances in medical knowledge and the many changes in what an earlier author called ""the tempestuous winds of medical fashion."" These textbooks in a way resemble businesses in a competitive market. The successful ones survive; the others eventually fall by the wayside. This one would seem to have a good prognosis: it is already in its third edition, it is readable, and it represents a pleasant compromise between the smaller, largely clinical manuals and the more exhaustive (and exhausting) compendia with their long chapters that never seem to end. The chapters in these volumes are of a reasonable length. Instead of",1995,JAMA
Using empirical covariance matrix in enhancing prediction accuracy of linear models with Missing Information,"Inference and Estimation in Missing Information (MI) scenarios are important topics in Statistical Learning Theory and Machine Learning (ML). In ML literature, attempts have been made to enhance prediction through precise feature selection methods. In sparse linear models, LASSO is well-known in extracting the desired support of the signal and resisting against noisy systems. When sparse models are also suffering from MI, the sparse recovery and inference of the missing models are taken into account simultaneously. In this paper, we will introduce an approach which enjoys sparse regression and covariance matrix estimation to improve matrix completion accuracy, and as a result enhancing feature selection preciseness which leads to reduction in prediction Mean Squared Error (MSE). We will compare the effect of employing covariance matrix in enhancing estimation accuracy to the case it is not used in feature selection. Simulations show the improvement in the performance as compared to the case where the covariance matrix estimation is not used.",2017,2017 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)
High-Dimensional Cox Regression Analysis in Genetic Studies with Censored Survival Outcomes,"With the advancement of high-throughput technologies, nowadays high-dimensional genomic and proteomic data are easy to obtain and have become ever increasingly important in unveiling the complex etiology of many diseases. While relating a large number of factors to a survival outcome through the Cox relative risk model, various techniques have been proposed in the literature. We review some recently developed methods for such analysis. For high-dimensional variable selection in the Cox model with parametric relative risk, we consider the univariate shrinkage method (US) using the lasso penalty and the penalized partial likelihood method using the folded penalties (PPL). The penalization methods are not restricted to the finite-dimensional case. For the high-dimensional (ð‘â†’âˆž, ð‘â‰ªð‘›) or ultrahigh-dimensional case (ð‘›â†’âˆž, ð‘›â‰ªð‘), both the sure independence screening (SIS) method and the extended Bayesian information criterion (EBIC) can be further incorporated into the penalization methods for variable selection. We also consider the penalization method for the Cox model with semiparametric relative risk, and the modified partial least squares method for the Cox model. The comparison of different methods is discussed and numerical examples are provided for the illustration. Finally, areas of further research are presented.",2012,Journal of Probability and Statistics
"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among men who have sex with men: results of the first integrated biological and behavioral survey in Burkina Faso, West Africa","BackgroundMany men who have sex with men (MSM) are at significant risk for HIV infection. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and correlates of HIV infection among MSM in Burkina Faso.MethodsA cross-sectional biological and behavioral survey was conducted from January to August 2013 among MSM in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. MSM 18â€‰years old and above were recruited using respondent driven sampling (RDS). A survey was administered to study participants followed by HIV testing. Population prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for the RDS design were produced using the RDS Analysis Tool version 6.0.1 (RDS, Inc., Ithaca, NY).ResultsA total of 662 MSM were enrolled in Ouagadougou (nâ€‰=â€‰333) and Bobo-Dioulasso (nâ€‰=â€‰329). The majority were unmarried, with an average age of 22.1â€‰Â±â€‰4.4â€‰years old in Ouagadougou and 23.1â€‰Â±â€‰4.7â€‰years old in Bobo-Dioulasso. RDS-adjusted HIV prevalence was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.9â€“3.1) in Ouagadougou and 2.7% (95% CI: 1.6â€“4.6) in Bobo-Dioulasso. HIV prevalence among MSM under 25â€‰years old was 1.3% (95% CI: 0.6â€“2.8) and 0.9% (95% CI: 0.4â€“2.5) respectively in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, compared to 5.4% (95% CI: 2.2â€“12.5) and 6.6% (95% CI: 3.4â€“12.3) among those 25â€‰years old or older in these cities (pâ€‰=â€‰0.010 and pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).ConclusionsResults from this first biological and behavioral survey among MSM in Burkina Faso suggest a need for programs to raise awareness among MSM and promote safer sex, particularly for young MSM to prevent HIV transmission. These programs would need support from donors for innovative actions such as promoting and providing pre-exposure prophylaxis, condoms and water-based lubricants, HIV counseling, testing, early treatment initiation and effective involvement of the MSM communities.",2019,BMC Public Health
Treatment of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation with Radiofrequency Ablation of Pulmonary Vein Foci,"Introduction: Pulmonary veins have been found to play an important role in generating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Ablation of arrhythmogenic pulmonary veins appears to be one of the approaches to cure lone atrial fibrillation, when antiarrhythmic drugs have been proven to be ineffective. The purpose of this study was to describe our experience of pulmonary vein ablation in veins where firing foci were found. Patients and method: The study population consisted of 32 consecutive patients with drug refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. All patients were free of structural heart disease and were separated in two groups, according to the mapping and ablation procedure which was applied. Group A included 13 patients (9 men and 4 women, mean age 52.6Â±10.7 years) with a mean of 8.8Â±5.2 episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation per month, and had received a mean number of 3.07Â±1.3 antiarrhythmic drugs. Ablation of pulmonary veins was performed between January 1997 and August 2001. All patients were selected according to existence of frequent atrial ectopic beats in the ECG or 24 hours Holter monitoring. In this group a single mapping and ablation electrode was used and ablation targeted according to the earliest electrical activity originating from within the pulmonary veins. The electrophysiological end point was the disappearance of these ectopic beats. Group B, consisted of 19 patients (16 men and 3 woman, mean age 54.3Â±9.8 year) with a mean of 8.7Â±10.7 episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation per month, who had received a mean number of 2.5Â±0.6 antiarrhythmic drugs. Ablation of pulmonary veins was performed between August 2001 and May 2002. In this group the mapping and ablation was targeted to dissociate or to eliminate pulmonary electrical activity from the atria, using a circumferential 10 pole mapping electrode (Lasso catheter). Results: In group A five patients (38.5%) remained asymptomatic and six patients (46%) had a reduction in the overall number and severity of symptoms during a follow-up period of 27.7Â±16.9 months. In group B, ten patients (52.6%) were asymptomatic and seven patients (36.8%) had a significant reduction in the overall number and severity of symptoms during 4.5Â±3 months of follow-up. The mean procedure time was 25 min shorter in group B (p<0.03). The total number of radiofrequency catheter applications was higher in group B (41Â±25.6 vs 14Â±7.8 applications in group A, p<0.01). One patient from group A developed left inferior pulmonary vein stenosis without any clinical consequences. Conclusion: According to our experience, ablation or isolation of focal foci in pulmonary veins appears to be a safe and effective method of treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but its effectiveness is less compared to other supraventricular arrhythmias.",2003,
Neural networks versus Logistic regression for 30â€‰days all-cause readmission prediction,"Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of hospital admissions in the US. Readmission within 30 days after a HF hospitalization is both a recognized indicator for disease progression and a source of considerable financial burden to the healthcare system. Consequently, the identification of patients at risk for readmission is a key step in improving disease management and patient outcome. In this work, we used a large administrative claims dataset to (1) explore the systematic application of neural network-based models versus logistic regression for predicting 30 days all-cause readmission after discharge from a HF admission, and (2) to examine the additive value of patientsâ€™ hospitalization timelines on prediction performance. Based on data from 272,778 (49% female) patients with a mean (SD) age of 73 years (14) and 343,328 HF admissions (67% of total admissions), we trained and tested our predictive readmission models following a stratified 5-fold cross-validation scheme. Among the deep learning approaches, a recurrent neural network (RNN) combined with conditional random fields (CRF) model (RNNCRF) achieved the best performance in readmission prediction with 0.642 AUC (95% CI, 0.640â€“0.645). Other models, such as those based on RNN, convolutional neural networks and CRF alone had lower performance, with a non-timeline based model (MLP) performing worst. A competitive model based on logistic regression with LASSO achieved a performance of 0.643 AUC (95% CI, 0.640â€“0.646). We conclude that data from patient timelines improve 30 day readmission prediction, that a logistic regression with LASSO has equal performance to the best neural network model and that the use of administrative data result in competitive performance compared to published approaches based on richer clinical datasets.",2019,Scientific Reports

"Morphology of gonoducts and male genital papilla, in the bluehead wrasse: implications and correlates on the control of gamete release","In the coral reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum, males vary the number of sperm they release in successive spawnings with individual females in accordance with female body and clutch size. The morphology and histological structure of the male genital papilla, sperm duct, oviduct and surrounding musculature were examined in an effort to elucidate the mechanism permitting control of the number of gametes released during mating. In males, urinary and genital ducts pass separately through a common urogenital papilla and are associated with a striated sphincter muscle and a pair of thin, smooth ligament muscles arising from the first proximal anal fin radial and passing laterally around the sperm duct and oviduct. Within the papilla, the sperm duct resembles a narrow funnel whose inner walls contain longitudinal folds or septa protruding into the lumen of the duct. Dorsal to the papilla, the sperm duct enlarges and is divided into numerous, open chambers by irregular, longitudinal trabeculae. The wall of the duct and the trabeculae contain flat epithelium, smooth muscle and loose connective tissue. In females, the oviduct contains no trabeculae and is not divided into chambers. The ligament muscles are more thoroughly embedded in the sphincter muscle of the rectum than in males. Some ways in which these structures might control gamete release are suggested.",1998,Journal of Fish Biology

LESS: a model-based classifier for sparse subspaces,"In this paper, we specifically focus on high-dimensional data sets for which the number of dimensions is an order of magnitude higher than the number of objects. From a classifier design standpoint, such small sample size problems have some interesting challenges. The first challenge is to find, from all hyperplanes that separate the classes, a separating hyperplane which generalizes well for future data. A second important task is to determine which features are required to distinguish the classes. To attack these problems, we propose the LESS (lowest error in a sparse subspace) classifier that efficiently finds linear discriminants in a sparse subspace. In contrast with most classifiers for high-dimensional data sets, the LESS classifier incorporates a (simple) data model. Further, by means of a regularization parameter, the classifier establishes a suitable trade-off between subspace sparseness and classification accuracy. In the experiments, we show how LESS performs on several high-dimensional data sets and compare its performance to related state-of-the-art classifiers like, among others, linear ridge regression with the LASSO and the support vector machine. It turns out that LESS performs competitively while using fewer dimensions.",2005,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
Comparing performance of Tabriz obstetrics and gynaecology hospitals managed as autonomous and budgetary units using Pabon Lasso method.,"BACKGROUND
Considering governmental scrutiny and financial constraints in medicine, the need for improved performance, which can provide acceptable care for medical consumers, leads to the conduct of new managerial methods to improve effectiveness.


AIMS
This study aimed to compare performance indicators of obstetrics and gynaecology teaching hospitals in Tabriz.


METHOD
A longitudinal, retrospective study was conducted to compare performance indexes of Tabriz obstetrics and gynaecology teaching hospitals during 2010-2012. Al-Zahra is Tabriz's central teaching hospital in obstetrics and gynaecology that is authorised under a board of trustees as an autonomous hospital and Taleghani hospital is managed under centralised administration. Study variables included: Average Length of Stay (ALOS), Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR), and Bed Turnover Ratio (BTR). The data was extracted via the Hospital Information Systems (HIS) within the hospitals' admission and discharge units. Pabon Lasso model was used to assess hospital performance. Data was analysed and graphs were plotted using the SPSS-17 software package.


RESULTS
According to study findings, overall ALOS in Al-Zahra hospital is 3.15 (2.15) days (1.88 (0.97) days for prenatal wards and 6.13 (0.97) days for neonatal wards) and ALOS in Taleghani Hospital is 3.37 (3.09) days (1.74 (0.14) days for perinatal wards and 5.96 (3.55) days for neonatal wards). In this regard, Al-Zahra hospital holds the maximum BOR with 86.92 per cent and the minimum BOR was attributed to Taleghani hospital at 68.44 per cent (P<0.001). Study findings indicate that BOR in neonatal wards is greater than prenatal wards. On the other hand, BOR in Al-Zahra is greater than Taleghani (P<0.001), whereas BOR trend shows an increasing pattern in both hospitals.


CONCLUSION
Results of this study showed that the performance of Al- Zahra Hospital is better than Taleghani Hospital. These two hospitals are similar in different aspects except Al-Zahra is under a board of trustees and Taleghani is not. We should also consider that Al-Zahra Hospital has more facilities than Taleghani.",2013,The Australasian medical journal
Blood-based multi-tissue gene expression inference with Bayesian ridge regression.,"MOTIVATION
Gene expression profiling is widely used in basic and cancer research but still not feasible in many clinical applications because tissues such as brain samples are difficult and not ethnical to collect. Gene expression in uncollected tissues can be computationally inferred using genotype and eQTLs. No methods can infer unmeasured gene expression of multiple tissues with single tissue gene expression profile as input.


RESULTS
We here present a Bayesian ridge regression based method (B-GEX) to infer gene expression profiles of multiple tissues from blood gene expression profile. For each gene in a tissue, a low dimensional feature vector was extracted from whole blood gene expression profile by feature selection. We used GTEx RNAseq data of16 tissues to train inference models to capture the cross-tissue expression correlations between each target gene in a tissue and its preselected feature genes in peripheral blood. We compared B-GEX with Least Square Regression, LASSO Regression and Ridge Regression. B-GEX outperforms the other three models in most tissues in terms of Mean Absolute Error, Pearson correlation coefficient and Root Mean Squared Error. Moreover, B-GEX infers expression level of tissue-specific genes as well as those of non-tissue-specific genes in all tissues. Unlike previous methods which require genomic features or gene expression profiles of multiple tissues, our model only requires whole blood expression profile as input. B-GEX helps gain insights into gene expressions of uncollected tissues from more accessible data of blood.

Volatile organic compounds increase the likelihood of detecting malignant pleural mesothelioma,"Background: Globally, 125 million people are still exposed to asbestos and at risk for developing malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Since MPM is diagnosed at advanced stage due to non-specific symptoms and investigations, it is thought that only an early diagnosis will improve patient9s outcome (van Meerbeeck et al, 2011). Breathomics has emerged as a new research field, allowing to detect breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which can be used as non-invasive markers for MPM (Lamote et al, 2014). Aim: We investigated the effect of breath analysis added to clinical variables for MPM diagnosis. Methods: Alveolar air was sampled from 23 MPM patients, 10 healthy asbestos-exposed individuals and 12 healthy non-exposed persons after fasting for 2 hours using the BioScout Multicapillary Column/Ion Mobility Spectrometer (MCC/IMS, B&S Analytik, Germany). VOCs were visually selected and their analysis was done by LASSO regression in R. The added value of these VOCs on the diagnostic performance of clinical variables for MPM was compared by ROC-analysis. Results: Modeling smoking status, asbestos exposure and gender did not result in discriminating MPM patients from controls. Adding VOCs to the model increased the AUCROC from 0.52 to 0.71, the diagnostic accuracy from 58% to 71%, the sensitivity from 65% to 87% and the specificity from 50% to 55%. Positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) increased from 0.58 to 0.67 and from 0.58 to 0.80 respectively. Conclusion: The large increase in accuracy, sensitivity and NPV of the diagnostic model when including VOCs suggests the possibility to use breath analysis as a step up tool in order to rule out MPM.",2015,European Respiratory Journal
Efficient methods for estimating constrained parameters with applications to lasso logistic regression.,"Fitting logistic regression models is challenging when their parameters are restricted. In this article, we first develop a quadratic lower-bound (QLB) algorithm for optimization with box or linear inequality constraints and derive the fastest QLB algorithm corresponding to the smallest global majorization matrix. The proposed QLB algorithm is particularly suited to problems to which EM-type algorithms are not applicable (e.g., logistic, multinomial logistic, and Cox's proportional hazards models) while it retains the same EM ascent property and thus assures the monotonic convergence. Secondly, we generalize the QLB algorithm to penalized problems in which the penalty functions may not be totally differentiable. The proposed method thus provides an alternative algorithm for estimation in lasso logistic regression, where the convergence of the existing lasso algorithm is not generally ensured. Finally, by relaxing the ascent requirement, convergence speed can be further accelerated. We introduce a pseudo-Newton method that retains the simplicity of the QLB algorithm and the fast convergence of the Newton method. Theoretical justification and numerical examples show that the pseudo-Newton method is up to 71 (in terms of CPU time) or 107 (in terms of number of iterations) times faster than the fastest QLB algorithm and thus makes bootstrap variance estimation feasible. Simulations and comparisons are performed and three real examples (Down syndrome data, kyphosis data, and colon microarray data) are analyzed to illustrate the proposed methods.",2008,Computational statistics & data analysis
4. The Kingdom of Man and the Earldom of Orkneyâ€”Some Comparisons,The Kingdom of Man and the Earldom of Orkney are the only two medieval thalassocracies in the British Isles. They are also the political heirs of Viking settlement in Scotland as well as being unique phenomena of the Norse colonial world. The kingdom and earldom were rather different in terms of their maritime geography. They had separate historical development in the post-Viking Age and historians of Orkney and Man have very rarely had any specific reason to look to the history of the other dynasty. This chapter looks at some of the sources to see what they reveal about the different status of Manx king and Orkney earl in their relationship with Norway. Despite their royal status it was clearly expected that the kings of Man as well as the earls of Orkney would make a tributary payment to each new king in Norway.

National Kidney Foundation report on dialyzer reuse.,"Numerous organizations have presented their views previously on the reprocessing of hemodialyzers. These were well summarized by Easterling (Easterling, RE: Regulations and Standards, in Deane, Wineman, Bemis [eds]: Guide to Reprocessing of Hemodialyzers. Martinus Nijhoff, 1986, pp 183-197). The publication of the Recommended Practice by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) on the reprocessing of dialyzers, coupled with the announcement of the Federal Government to accept these as the basis for Regulations administered by HCFA (now published as ""Standards for the Reuse of Hemodialyzer Filters and Other Dialysis Supplies,"" Federal Register, Oct. 2, 1987), prompted the President of The National Kidney Foundation, Dr Richard Glassock, to appoint a Task Force to formulate the Foundation's position on the above. The members of the Task Force were: Michael J. Fisher, Raymond Hakim, MD, Nathan W. Levin, MD, Chairperson, John M. Newmann, PhD, David A. Ogden, MD, and Vincent Pizziconi, PhD. After having reviewed the previous NKF report on the issue of dialyzer reuse (American Journal of Kidney Diseases 3:466, 1984), the Task Force resolved that the principles of patient consent to dialyzer reuse and right to refuse a reused dialyzer as presented in the report be reaffirmed. While accepting the AAMI Recommended Practice as the basis for its recommendations, the Task Force recognized that the concerns of some patients were not met by the document. In addition to a number of technical amendments that were proposed, the Task Force, acting in the interest of patients, felt that it was essential to add information concerning the potential advantages and disadvantages of reuse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1988,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation
Prevention and social constructivism.,"Humans of the communism future ought to be healthy, happy and by a high birth rate assure expanding reproduction. So, the idea of prevention was very natural to communist physicians. In 1923, the Moscow health care department led by Vladimir Obukh (physician to Vladimir Lenin's family), initiated health check-ups for workers. Physicians promised communist leadership that after the check-ups, the need for drugs would expire. In the next decade, millions of workers went through check-ups and were registered for â€˜dispanserizationâ€™ in big cities.1 The mass health check-ups were not the worst things in their time: in some countries, the mass sterilization and killing of â€˜not worthy to liveâ€™ were initiated.

Since these times, the primordiality of prevention in the health care system was put in the legal base of Soviet and post-Soviet Russia. Nevertheless, after 1964, the length of life in USSR started to decline. In the 1970s, communist leadership classified the data on mortality and in 1980s tried the old recipeâ€”the all-nation dispanserization. Of course, it failed again, because the enormously â€¦

Genome-Wide Mapping of Geneâ€“Phenotype Relationships in Experimentally Evolved Populations,"Model organisms subjected to sustained experimental evolution often show levels of phenotypic differentiation that dramatically exceed the phenotypic differences observed in natural populations. Genome-wide sequencing of pooled populations then offers the opportunity to make inferences about the genes that are the cause of these phenotypic differences. We tested, through computer simulations, the efficacy of a statistical learning technique called the ""fused lasso additive model"" (FLAM). We focused on the ability of FLAM to distinguish between genes which are differentiated and directly affect a phenotype from differentiated genes which have no effect on the phenotype. FLAM can separate these two classes of genes even with relatively small samples (10 populations, in total). The efficacy of FLAM is improved with increased number of populations, reduced environmental phenotypic variation, and increased within-treatment among-replicate variation. FLAM was applied to SNP variation measured in both twenty-population and thirty-population studies of Drosophila subjected to selection for age-at-reproduction, to illustrate the application of the method.",2018,Molecular Biology and Evolution
Essays in Behavioral Economics and Innovation,"This dissertation consists of three essays, two in behavioral economics and one on the economics of innovation. The first essay, which is joint work with Emily Glassberg Sands, exploits the randomness of weather and the relationship between weather and movie-going to quantify network externalities (i.e., a preference for shared experience) in movie consumption. Instrumenting for early viewership with unanticipated and plausibly exogenous weather shocks captured in LASSO-chosen instrument sets, we find that a shock to opening weekend viewership is doubled over the following five weekends. Our estimated momentum arises almost exclusively at the local level, and varies neither with ex-post movie quality nor with the precision of ex-ante information about movie quality, suggesting the observed momentum is unrelated to learning. The second essay, which is joint work with Michael Luca and Deepak Malhotra, asks whether higher wages elicit reciprocity and hence higher productivity. In a field experiment with 266 employees, we find that paying above-market wages, per se, does not have an effect on productivity relative to paying market wages (in a one-time job with no future employment opportunities). However, structuring a portion of the wage as a clear and unexpected giftâ€“by offering a raise (with no additional conditions) after the employee has accepted the contractâ€“does lead to higher productivity for the duration of the job. Targeted gifts are more efficient than hiring more workers. However, the mechanism underlying our effect makes this unlikely to explain persistent above-market wages.",2015,
A Prototype Knockoff Filter for Group Selection with FDR Control,"In many applications, we need to study a linear regression model that consists of a response variable and a large number of potential explanatory variables and determine which variables are truly associated with the response. In 2015, Barber and Candes introduced a new variable selection procedure called the knockoff filter to control the false discovery rate (FDR) and proved that this method achieves exact FDR control. In this paper, we propose a prototype knockoff filter for group selection by extending the Reid-Tibshirani prototype method. Our prototype knockoff filter improves the computational efficiency and statistical power of the Reid-Tibshirani prototype method when it is applied for group selection. In some cases when the group features are spanned by one or a few hidden factors, we demonstrate that the PCA prototype knockoff filter outperforms the Dai-Barber group knockoff filter. We present several numerical experiments to compare our prototype knockoff filter with the Reid-Tibshirani prototype method and the group knockoff filter. We have also conducted some analysis of the knockoff filter. Our analysis reveals that some knockoff path method statistics, including the Lasso path statistic, may lead to loss of power for certain design matrices and a specially designed response even if their signal strengths are still relatively strong.",2019,Information and Inference: A Journal of the IMA
Oracle model selection for nonlinear models based on weighted composite quantile regression accelerated failure time model,"In this paper we propose a weighted composite quantile regression (WCQR) estimation approach and study model selection for nonlinear models with a diverging number of parameters. The WCQR is augmented using a data-driven weighting scheme. With the error distribution unspecified, the proposed estimators share robustness from quantile regression and achieve nearly the same efficiency as the oracle maximum likelihood estimator for a variety of error distributions including the normal, mixed-normal, Student's t, Cauchy distributions, etc. Based on the proposed WCQR, we use the adaptive-LASSO and SCAD regularization to simultaneously estimate parameters and select models. Under regularity conditions, we establish asymptotic equivalency of the two model selection methods and show that they perform as well as if the correct submodels are known in advance. We also suggest an algorithm for fast implementation of the proposed methodology. Simulations are conducted to compare different estimators, and an example is used to illustrate their performance.",2012,Statistica Sinica
Positive graphical lasso estimation of sparse inverse covariance matrices,"We explore the possibility of estimating sparse inverse covariance matrices when for scientific reasons the covariance matrix is restricted to be a non-negative matrix. The process mirrors the graphical lasso process developed by Friedman and others (2008) that did not have this additional constraint. Accordingly, the Lasso procedure is done through coordinate descent. To easily add the constraint, we modified the LARS function created by Efron and others (2004) to perform positive Lasso (pLasso) estimation. The process is demonstrated on several time series generated datasets to clearly show the effectiveness and limitations. Introduction Recent work into mapping gene regulatory networks has led to the use of Fortuinâ€“Kasteleynâ€“ Ginibre (FKG) inequalities to identify unexpected correlations. These correlations can be unexpected for various scientific reasons. However, advancing technology combined with practical/financial constraints gives rise to systems with n (~40) â‰ª p (~10,000). For example, n could be the number of gene expression samples, and p could be the number of genes for which gene expression is measured. Additionally, most of these genes will be conditionally uncorrelated. The graphical Lasso algorithm developed by Friedman and others (2008) was made to deal with this estimation of sparse inverse covariance matrices. However, the desire to eliminate the unexpected correlations from networks results in a simple constraint on this estimation problem. We develop a similar and easy to implement algorithm, utilizing previous work, for performing estimation under these conditions. Estimation of Î£ Let Î˜ = Î£ and S be the sample covariance matrix. The penalized log-likelihood is then ln|Î˜| âˆ’ tr(SÎ˜) âˆ’ Ïâ€–Î˜â€–1 (1) Paul Logan Masters Project Oregon State University 2 where â€–Î˜â€–1 = âˆ‘ |Î˜ij| i,j . We wish to find the positive semi-definite matrix Î˜ that maximizes this function. Banerjee and others (2007) showed that this is convex and instead outlined a method for estimating Î£. It is shown that the problem can be solved in block coordinate descent fashion. If W = Î˜ is the estimate of Î£, then we can partition W and S. W = ( W11 w12 w12 T w22 ) , S = ( S11 s12 s12 T s22 ) (2) Then the solution for each row and column is w12 = argminy{y W11 y âˆ¶ â€–y âˆ’ s12â€–âˆž â‰¤ Ï} . (3) By convex duality, this is equivalent to solving min Î² { 1 2 â€–W11 1 2 â„ Î² âˆ’ bâ€– 2 + Ïâ€–Î²â€–1} (4) with b = W11 âˆ’1/2 s12. Then, w12 = W11Î² is the solution to equation (3), where Î² is the solution to equation (4). Equivalence Verification To maximize the log-likelihood, we take a matrix derivative with respect to Î˜ and set equal to zero. We get W âˆ’ S âˆ’ ÏÎ“ = 0 , (5) with Î“ij = sign(Î˜ij) if Î˜ij â‰  0 and Î“ij âˆˆ [âˆ’1, 1] if Î˜ij = 0. The upper right component of this equation gives w12 âˆ’ s12 âˆ’ ÏÎ³12 = 0 . (6) To perform the minimization in equation (4), first note that 1 2 â€–W11 1 2 â„ Î² âˆ’ bâ€– 2 + Ïâ€–Î²â€–1 = 1 2 Î²W11Î² âˆ’ Î² W11 1 2 b + 1 2 bb + Ï âˆ‘ |Î²i| i (7) Therefore, taking the derivative of equation (7) with respect to Î² and setting equal to zero gives W11Î² âˆ’ s12 + ÏÎ½ = 0 , (8) with Î½ = sign(Î²). Since WÎ˜ = I, we know that W11Î¸12 + w12Î¸22 = 0, and thus Î¸12 = âˆ’Î¸22W11 w12. Then, Î³12 = sign(Î¸12) = âˆ’sign(Î¸22W11 w12) = âˆ’sign(W11 w12) = âˆ’sign(Î²) = âˆ’Î½, since Î¸22 > 0. Also, we know w12 = W11Î², thus equations (6) and (8) are equivalent. Algorithm From equation (5) it can be seen that wii = sii + Ï since Î¸ii > 0 âˆ€ i. Equation (4) is effectively Lasso regression with X = W11 1/2 and y = b = W11 âˆ’1/2 s12. Starting with W = S + ÏI, recursively solve Paul Logan Masters Project Oregon State University 3 for and replace each row/column of W, w12, by inputting the rest of W, W11, and the corresponding row/column of S, s12, through Lasso regression until convergence. FKG Inequality and MTP2 There are many biological contexts, particularly in genetics, where certain types of correlation cannot be physically possible. In these situations, if the data suggests a physically inconsistent correlation, we know it is due to noise. These occurrences are referred to as unexpected correlations. Mathematically, these are any correlations that do not satisfy the Fortuinâ€“Kasteleynâ€“Ginibre (FKG) inequalities. Fortuin and others (1971) state that if the FKG condition, Î¼(x âˆ§ y)Î¼(x âˆ¨ y) â‰¥ Î¼(x)Î¼(y), is met for some non-negative function Î¼ and x, y in a finite distributive lattice X, then if f and g are monotonically increasing functions the FKG inequality states [âˆ‘ f(x)g(x)Î¼(x) xâˆˆX ][âˆ‘ Î¼(x) xâˆˆX ] â‰¥ [âˆ‘ f(x)Î¼(x) xâˆˆX ][âˆ‘ g(x)Î¼(x) xâˆˆX ]. (9) If Î¼(x) is a probability measure, this simply becomes Cov(f(x), g(x)) â‰¥ 0. (10) Rinott and Scarsini (2006) state that a distribution whose probability measure fulfills the FKG condition is equivalently Multivariate Totally Positive of order 2 (MTP2). This is important because Karlin and Rinott (1980) showed that when a density is MTP2, then all off-diagonal elements of Î˜ = Î£ are non-positive. This then implies that all elements of W are non-negative. Estimation of positive Î£ The construction of the previous algorithm does not break down with the additional condition that w12 â‰¥ 0, since convexity remains. The only change that must be made is that the solution to the Lasso regression must be non-negative, Î² â‰¥ 0. Augmentation of the Lasso algorithm into a Positive Lasso (pLasso) regression is not simple. However, both Lasso and pLasso are specific examples of Least Angle Regression (LAR). Efron and others (2004) describe the method by which LAR is used to calculate Lasso estimates and list the few changes necessary to instead calculate pLasso estimates. New Algorithm The LAR function in R was edited so that the Lasso option instead calculated pLasso estimates. The previous algorithm was then followed with a pLasso solution instead of a Lasso solution for Î². To remove bias in particular locations in Î£ that may arise from the order in which rows/columns are updated, the order is randomly selected. This new algorithm is named pLarso. Paul Logan Masters Project Oregon State University 4 Example 1 n = 1000, p = 10, yt = 0.6ytâˆ’1 + Îµt , Îµt âˆ¼ N (0, 1 4 ) Î£1âˆ’2,1âˆ’2 âˆ’1 = 1 1âˆ’Ï2 ( 1 âˆ’Ï âˆ’Ï 1 + Ï ) = ( 1.5625 âˆ’0.9375 âˆ’0.9375 2.1250 ) The above AR(1) time series was simulated using arima.sim, where n is the number of times series simulated and p is the length of each time series. Estimates of Î£ are found in Tables 1-3 in the Appendix. While gLasso results in some sparsity, the pLarso algorithm results in the sparsest estimate. The LAR algorithm results in no sparsity, but slightly better (less biased) estimates on the tri-diagonal. Example 2 n = 10, p = 20, yt = 0.6ytâˆ’1 + Îµt, Îµt âˆ¼ N (0, 1 4 ) Î£1âˆ’2,1âˆ’2 âˆ’1 = 1 1 âˆ’ Ï2 ( 1 âˆ’Ï âˆ’Ï 1 + Ï ) = ( 1.5625 âˆ’0.9375 âˆ’0.9375 2.1250 ) The same series is simulated in Example 2, but longer and with fewer replications. In this case S is not full rank and thus not invertible. Left half of estimates of Î£ are found in Tables 4-6 in the Appendix. In terms of sparsity, the results roughly match Example 1. However, actual estimates are now all inflated. Of course, for model selection (or network mapping) this is not a concern. Example 3 n = 1000, p = 10, yt = 0.6ytâˆ’1 âˆ’ 0.2ytâˆ’2 + Îµt , Îµt âˆ¼ N (0, 1 4 ) Î£1âˆ’3,1âˆ’3 âˆ’1 = ( 1.3889 âˆ’0.8333 0.2778 âˆ’0.8333 1.8889 âˆ’1.0000 0.2778 âˆ’1.0000 1.9444 ) An AR(2) time series was chosen for Example 3 to specifically have positive off-diagonal elements in Î£. Estimates of Î£ are found in Tables 7-9 in the Appendix. Relative sparsity among the methods is similar to Example 1. However, the elements that should be equal to 0.2778 have been suppressed to zero by the pLarso algorithm.

Ã–kologische Untersuchungen Ã¼ber die Terrestrische Arthropodenfauna im Anwurf Mariner Algen,"ZusammenfassungIn kÃ¼nstlichem Strandanwurf wurde wÃ¤hrend vier jeweils ein Jahr lang laufenden Versuchsserien die Arthropodenbesiedlung verfolgt. Jeweils zwei Serien begannen im FrÃ¼hsommer und im FrÃ¼hwinter. In 791 Terminproben (in zweiwÃ¶chigen AbstÃ¤nden) wurden 68000 Diptera, 122000 Collembola und 161000 Acari gesammelt. Die Collembolen und Dipteren konnten fast sÃ¤mtlich bis zur Art bestimmt werden, wÃ¤hrend die Milben leider nur in ihrer Gesamtheit zahlenmÃ¤ÃŸig erfaÃŸt werden konnten.AuÃŸer der faunistischen Bearbeitung werden die VerÃ¤nderungen verschiedener Umweltfaktoren beschrieben: Lufttemperatur, Niederschlagsmenge, Sonnenscheindauer, Substrattemperatur, Wassergehalt des Anwurfmaterials, pH, NaCl-Gehalt und Zersetzungsgrad.Durch Versuchsbeginn in verschiedenen Jahreszeiten konnte gezeigt werden, daÃŸ die sich regelmÃ¤ÃŸig einstellenden Arten und ArtenverbÃ¤nde im allgemeinen nicht von sukzessiv im Substrat ablaufenden VerÃ¤nde rungen abhÃ¤ngig sind, sondern daÃŸ hier in erster Linie jahreszeitliche Bindungen vorliegen. Eine eindeutige â€žSukzessionâ€ bestoht jedoch insgesamt gesehen fÃ¼r die groÃŸen â€žGruppenâ€ der Saprobionten und der Bodentiere.Einige jeweils im Litoral des Hafenbeckens aufgestellte VersuchskÃ¶rbe wurden in etwas stÃ¤rkerem MaÃŸe von halobionten Dipteren (z. B. Fucellia intermedia) besiedelt als die 110 m vom Wasser entfernt stehenden StandardkÃ¶rbe. DafÃ¼r waren in den wasserfernen StandardkÃ¶rben die thalassoxenen Saprobionten (wie Syritta pipiens) hÃ¤ufiger.Die Temperatur hat eine groÃŸe Ã¶kologische Bedeutung. Collembolen erreichten ihre grÃ¶ÃŸte Besiedlungsdichte stets in den Wintermonaten. Adulte Tiere ertrugen Werte bis â€” 13Â° C im Substrat. In Laborzuchten vermehrten sich mehrere Arten bei Zimmertemperatur nicht, dagegen gut bei + 10Â° C. Die Larven mehrerer Dipterenarten (Fucellia, Scatomyza u. a.) tolerierten die in einer Erhitzungsphase zu Beginn der Verrottung der Algen auftretenden Temperaturen von + 40Â° C. Im strengen Winter 1962/63 war die Anzahl besonders der Dipterenlarven deutlich geringer als in den anderen Wintern.Ein EinfluÃŸ der in den Versuchen oft kurzfristigen Schwankungen des Wassergehaltes wurde nicht beobachtet. Das Verhalten der Collembolen Hypogastrura viatica und Isotoma viridis in einer einfachen Feuchtigkeitsorgel wurde geprÃ¼ft; dabei zeigte sich, daÃŸ bei der letzteren Art die Form riparia hÃ¶here Luftfeuchtigkeiten bevorzugt als die Form principalis. Dieser Befund entspricht der Ã¶kologischen Verbreitung beider Formen.Ein direkter EinfluÃŸ verschiedener pH-Werte wurde nicht nachgewiesen.Der Salzgehalt ist als Ã¶kologischer Faktor von groÃŸer Bedeutung. ParallelkÃ¶rbe wurden mit See- und Regenwasser behandelt; im ersten Fall zeigte sich eine ErhÃ¶hung der NaCl-Werte, deren AusmaÃŸ aber stark witterungsabhÃ¤ngig war, im zweiten Fall war das gesamte Salz schon nach zwei bis drei Monaten ausgewaschen. Eine deutliche Bevorzugung der SalzwasserkÃ¶rbe war bei keiner Art, auch nicht bei den Halobionten, festzustellen. Dagegen bildeten z. B. die Psychoda- und Scatopse-Arten unter den Dipteren nur in den RegenwasserkÃ¶rben dichte Populationen. Collembolen waren insgesamt in den RegenwasserkÃ¶rben bedeutend hÃ¤ufiger.Die Bedeutung des Zersetzungsgrades fÃ¼r die tierische Besiedlung bleibt offenbar hinter der anderer Faktoren zurÃ¼ck. Zumindest war die Zusammensetzung der Fauna in einigen erst nach einem halben Jahr zur Besiedlung freigegebenen KÃ¶rben nicht grundsÃ¤tzlich anders als in den zu derselben Zeit neu aufgestellten KÃ¶rben. Direkte Bodenformen traten stets erst gegen Ende der Versuchsserien auf.AutÃ¶kologische Daten der auftretenden Arten werden mitgeteilt und durch Literaturangaben ergÃ¤nzt.SynÃ¶kologische Beziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Arten lieÃŸen sich nur in sehr beschrÃ¤nktem Umfang nachweisen (RÃ¤uber-Beute, Phoresie). Die Frage, ob damit ein Beweis gegen das Bestehen von BiocÃ¶nosen erbracht ist, wird verneint.SummaryThe arthropod fauna in seaweed wrack was observed in four experimental series, each extending over one year. The different series were started in December 1961, June 1962, December 1962, and June 1963. On the whole 68000 specimens of the Diptera, 122000 of the Collembola, and 161000 of the Acari were found in 791 samples, taken at intervals of about fourteen days. Collembola and Diptera â€” with few exceptions â€”were exactly determined while mites could only be delt with statistically. The changes in the single ecological factors â€” such as temperature of air, rainfall, insolation, temperature and water content of the wrack, pH, salinity, and degree of decomposition â€” are described.By starting our experiments in different seasons we were able to show that the appearance of species is not exclusively connected with the successive changes in the condition of the wrack; but it is mainly due to the seasons. An unmistakable succession only exists for the large groups of â€œsaprobionticsâ€ and the â€œsoil animalsâ€ on the whole.Several Fucus-filled baskets installed in the litoral of a basin were frequented on a larger scale by halobiontic Diptera (e.g. Fucellia intermedia) than baskets which were placed at a greater distance (110 m) from the shore of the â€œJadebusenâ€. In the latter baskets more thalassoxenic saprobiontic Diptera (e.g. Syritta pipiens) were found.The temperature is of great ecological importance. Collembola reached their greatest abundance in winter. Adults tolerated temperatures of substratum to â€” 13Â° C. Experiments in our laboratory showed that several species which did not propagate at room temperature bred well at a temperature of + 10Â° C. Several larvae of flies even tolerated the temperatures of + 40Â° C occuring in the initial phase of decomposition. In the severe winter of 1962/63 the abundance of Diptera larvae was obviously diminished, compared with other years.The often short termed changes in the water content of the wrack did not show any obvious influence on the fauna. The behaviour of Hypogastrura viatica and Isotoma viridis (Collembola) was observed at different degrees of atmospheric humidity. Isotoma viridis forma riparia prefered a higher atmospheric humidity than forma principalis, what was to be expected as f. riparia lives in moister habitats.The pH did not directly influence the fauna.Salinity had a great ecological importance. In our experiments several baskets were regularly showered with freshwater every third day, while other baskets were wetted with saltwater. In the â€œfreshwater-basketsâ€ the NaCl-concentration sank below 2% after two months, whereas the salinity of the â€œsaltwater-basketsâ€ was eminently increased. The results, however, proofed that the halobiontic Diptera did not clearly prefer the â€œsaltwater-basketsâ€. On the other hand various species of Diptera (e.g. Psychoda spp., Scatopse spp.) and all the Collembola had their greatest abundances in the â€œfreshwater-basketsâ€.The degree of decomposition apparently was of lesser importance than the other ecological factors. In baskets, which were settled by the arthropods only after a six months' decomposition of the algae, the fauna was nearly the same as in those filled with fresh algae at the same time. Genuine â€œsoil animalsâ€ were exclusively found ten to twelve months later than the series were started.Autecological facts of the species are given and completed by references.Only few synecological connections between different species were found (predator-prey-behaviour; phoresy). This, however, is not an evidence that biocoenoses do not exist at all.",2004,Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Morphologie und Ã–kologie der Tiere
"Preliminary results of official influenza and acute respiratory infection surveillance in two towns of Burkina Faso, 2013â€“2015","BackgroundIn 2010, influenza, influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) surveillance was established by the government of Burkina Faso. We provide preliminary descriptive results from this surveillance activity.MethodsThe study period was 2013 through 2015. Two primary healthcare facilities in Bobo-Dioulasso district reported ILI in outpatients. Influenza virology, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), was available for a proportion of ILI patients. One hospital, in the capital Ouagadougou, reported ARI in both outpatients and inpatients (hospitalized). Inpatients admitted with ARI were considered severe ARI (SARI). We estimated the proportion of primary care outpatient visits that were ILI, and the proportion of those that were due to influenza, by age. We estimated the proportion of hospital outpatient visits that were ARI and the proportion of those that were SARI, by age.ResultsAmong combined outpatient visits in the Bobo-Dioulasso facilities, 19.6% were for ILI. One half (49.9%) of outpatient visits in infants and 30.9% in 1â€“4Â year-olds were ILI. Among ILI outpatient visits 14.8% were due to influenza virus and, of these, 58.5% were type A and 41.5% type B. At the Ouagadougou hospital, 6.7% of outpatient visits were ARI, and 22.3% of those were SARI. The highest proportions of ARI were among infants (19.8%) and 1â€“4Â year-olds (16.0%). The proportion of ARI that was SARI was highest among â‰¥15Â year-olds (31.5%) followed by 1â€“4Â year-olds (22.4%). Overall, 4.1% of SARI patients died.ConclusionsThese preliminary data indicate the importance of respiratory infections among health care attendances in Burkina Faso, and influenza may be an important contributor to these.",2018,BMC Infectious Diseases
Textual Cultures 12.2,"Lâ€™articolo riflette sui modi di produzione delle edizioni scientifiche digitali, lamentandone i costi eccessivi che di fatto escludono i giovani ricercatori dalla loro produzione. Utilizzando una metafora presa in prestito dal mondo della moda, le edizioni scientifiche digitali esistenti sono paragonate allâ€™haute couture e al prÃªt-Ã -porter: lâ€™autrice distingue infatti le edizioni specializzate, caratterizzate dai costi elevati e dallâ€™essere costruite â€œsu misuraâ€ (haute couture) da quelle seriali, caratterizzate da una certa uniformitÃ  e dai costi ridotti (prÃªt-Ã porter), auspicando una piÃ¹ generale diffusione di questâ€™ultimo modello. La seconda parte dellâ€™articolo riflette sulle caratteristiche delle edizioni seriali e loro relazioni con le edizioni specializzate. This article reflects on current ways of producing digital scholarly editions, noting that they typically involve excessive costs that effectively exclude young or independent scholars from undertaking their production. Using a metaphor borrowed from the world of fashion, existing digital scholarly editions are described as either â€˜haute coutureâ€™ or â€˜prÃªt-Ã -porterâ€™: that is, either specialized editions characterized by high costs and by production â€˜to measureâ€™ (haute couture), or those that use existing frameworks and so are characterized by a certain uniformity and reduced costs (prÃªt-Ã -porter). The article argues for a wider diffusion of the latter model, but the second part presents a reflection on the characteristics of these editions and their productive interactions with the more specialized type of edition. La creazione di edizioni digitali scientifiche altamente sofisticate e su misura ha caratterizzato la fase â€œpionieristicaâ€ della filologia digitale; tuttavia, nonostante lâ€™eccellenza dei risultati scientifici prodotti da molte di quelle edizioni, ci sono diversi motivi per considerare le edizioni prodotte finora come meno che soddisfacenti da molti punti di vista. Il problema principale consiste nel fatto che ogni edizione digitale presenta il testo in modi diversi, a volte riconducibili a tipi di edizioni tradizionali come le edizioni diplomatiche o critiche, a volte seguendo modelli innoTextual Cultures 12.2 (2019): 5â€“17. DOI: 10.14434/textual.v12i2.27685 6 | Textual Cultures 12.2 (2019) vativi e senza precedenti che offrono diversi tipi di testualitÃ  e interazioni ai loro utenti spesso disorientati dalle troppe scelte disponibili; tali diversitÃ  sono presenti nonostante (e forse grazie a) una forte uniformitÃ  dei dati, visto che la maggior parte delle edizioni utilizza il formato sviluppato dalla Text Encoding Initiative (TEI Consortium 2018). Inoltre, da un punto di vista tecnico le edizioni sono offerte da una sconcertante gamma di piattaforme diverse, la maggior parte delle quali sono prodotte ad hoc per un progetto specifico, per lo piÃ¹ elaborate da una squadra di sviluppatori specializzati e che quindi risultano difficilmente generalizzabili. CiÃ² significa che queste edizioni sono risorse molto costose, producibili solo grazie a finanziamenti generosi. Inoltre, le edizioni digitali devono essere necessariamente e ogni volta innovative e diverse, altrimenti potrebbero non ottenere quei finanziamenti che sono necessari alla loro stessa esistenza (Causer, Tonra e Wallace 2012), un requisito che impedisce ulteriormente lo sviluppo di modelli e strumenti stabili e riusabili. Questi fatti hanno diverse conseguenze: in primo luogo, la loro varietÃ  produce unâ€™oggettiva difficoltÃ  di valutazione da parte della comunitÃ  scientifica, con il risultato che le edizioni digitali mancano spesso di riconoscimento come espressioni autorevoli della ricerca ecdotica; in secondo luogo, la creazione di edizioni digitali Ã¨ possibile solo per quegli studiosi che possono assicurarsi grandi quantitÃ  di finanziamenti, escludendo cosÃ¬ un gran numero di potenziali ricercatori, soprattutto quelli allâ€™inizio della carriera; in terzo luogo, lâ€™alto livello di variazione di queste risorse, da un lato Ã¨ causato dalla mancanza di strumenti prontamente disponibili, ma dallâ€™altro ha impedito lo sviluppo di tali strumenti, un fatto che perpetua quindi il problema; infine, la specializzazione di tali edizioni rende la loro conservazione a lungo termine particolarmente complessa e costosa, con il risultato che le edizioni digitali sono percepite come instabili e non degne di investimento e di considerazione accademica. Questi inconvenienti possono aiutare a spiegare perchÃ© cosÃ¬ tante edizioni scientifiche sono ancora pubblicate solo su carta, con la conseguenza che i filologi, che sono stati tra i primi e piÃ¹ fini adottatori di metodi digitali, sono ancora oggi combattuti tra il desiderio di sfruttare le opportunitÃ  offerte dal supporto digitale e la sicurezza offerta da una pubblicazione cartacea. Questâ€™ultima, tuttavia, non Ã¨ esente da problemi, come, per esempio, (1) la comprovata limitazione della pagina rettangolare e la finitezza di ciÃ² che puÃ² essere incluso allâ€™interno delle copertine, entrambi fattori non triviali per rappresentare adeguatamente la complessitÃ  dei manoscritti dâ€™autore, dei testi modernisti o di grandi tradizioni testuali con centinaia di testimoni; (2) la scarsa circolazione delle edizioni scientifiche al di lÃ  del cirE. Pierazzo : Quale infrastruttura per le edizioni digitali? | 7 colo ristretto che le produce, una scarsitÃ  derivante anche dal costo molto alto di tali volumi, spesso accessibili solo dalle biblioteche; (3) la posizione di forza delle case editrici che spesso determinano cosa deve essere pubblicato e come, il che porta a escludere testi di nicchia o percepiti come poco vendibili; (4) la generale mancanza di interesse della comunitÃ  scientifica storico-letteraria per la critica testuale. La filologia digitale Ã¨ stata vista come un modo per superare questi problemi (Robinson 2003 e 2005), ma mentre alcuni di essi sono stati effettivamente affrontati adeguatamente, altri restano da risolvere. Il problema dei costi sembra il piÃ¹ pressante e quello che ha tenuto lontani molti studiosi, data la mancanza endemica di finanziamenti per le discipline umanistiche (Robinson 2016). Il contrasto tra il modello finanziario di unâ€™edizione basata sulla stampa e uno digitale Ã¨ alquanto eloquente: i costi di produzione delle edizioni a stampa sono relativamente bassi, o, piÃ¹ precisamente, i loro modelli finanziari e di lavoro sono integrati nellâ€™infrastruttura di finanziamento della maggior parte delle istituzioni accademiche. Le edizioni a stampa sono spesso prodotte durante il tempo di ricerca â€œnormaleâ€ degli studiosi e come tali sono preparate in tempi lunghi: non Ã¨ insolito che unâ€™edizione richieda dieci o piÃ¹ anni per essere pubblicata; i finanziamenti sono normalmente richiesti per andare in biblioteca, ma ancora una volta, poichÃ© il calendario dellâ€™edizione Ã¨ abbastanza diffuso, in molti casi questi costi possono essere coperti da indennitÃ  di ricerca regolari. In effetti, per gli studiosi Ã¨ di solito molto piÃ¹ facile accedere a piccole somme di denaro ogni anno, piuttosto che a una grande quantitÃ  tutta in una volta. Infine, il sostegno per coprire i costi di pubblicazione puÃ² spesso essere ottenuto grazie a specifici fondi universitari o facendo ricorso a fondazioni e/o finanziatori privati. Al contrario, le edizioni digitali hanno normalmente un modello finanziario e lavorativo simile al progetto (Burdick et al. 2012, 130): poichÃ© lo sviluppo tecnico richiede in genere lâ€™assunzione di una forza lavoro specializzata, il lavoro non puÃ² essere distribuito come per le edizioni stampate e deve essere concentrato in un tempo relativamente breve (il tempo della disponibilitÃ  dei fondi). Questo fatto richiede ai filologi di dedicare una notevole quantitÃ  di tempo in modo mirato, e questo a sua volta richiede spesso ulteriori finanziamenti specifici per poter acquistare tale tempo. Mentre questa nuova cronologia potrebbe essere vista per molti aspetti come un miglioramento (con le edizioni che diventano disponibili in modo tempestivo), il lavoro editoriale, tuttavia, non puÃ² essere facilmente compresso in questo modo: lâ€™attenzione ai dettagli richiesta per operazioni come trascrizione, collazione e edizione Ã¨ raggiunta meglio se eseguita in piccole dosi. Inoltre, il brevissimo lasso di 8 | Textual Cultures 12.2 (2019) tempo consentito dalla maggior parte dei sistemi di finanziamento (comunemente da due a tre anni) non consente scoperte di nuovi materiali e/o di gestire le complicazioni che si incontrano spesso mentre si maneggiano manoscritti e altri tipi di fonti primarie; il risultato Ã¨ che alla fine del finanziamento molte edizioni non sono ancora pronte per il pubblico o non soddisfano gli standard esigenti dei filologi; tuttavia, pubblicate devono essere, poichÃ© i fondi finiscono e ai finanziatori deve essere mostrato che qualcosa Ã¨ stato fatto con il loro denaro. Il risultato Ã¨ che molte edizioni sono pubblicate sul web con una dichiarazione di non responsabilitÃ  di â€œBetaâ€ o â€œLavori in corsoâ€, ad esempio il progetto LangScape (http://www.langscape. org.uk/index.html), sul quale si puÃ² vedere Stokes e Pierazzo 2009, e il Vercelli Book (http://vbd.humnet.unipi.it/beta2/). In un articolo precedente (Pierazzo e Leclerc 2015) questo tipo di edizioni Ã¨ stato definito come edizioni haute couture, con una metafora che viene qui riproposta.1 Edizioni haute couture e edizioni prÃªt-Ã -porter Lâ€™industria della moda distingue chiaramente tra due linee di prodotti: lâ€™haute couture, lâ€™alta moda, e il prÃªt-Ã -porter. La prima Ã¨ caratterizzata dal fatto che ogni pezzo Ã¨ unico e viene spesso creato per una sola persona da indossare per unâ€™occasione speciale, sul tappeto rosso. Lâ€™alta moda puÃ² e di solito deve essere innovativa e creativa e ha piÃ¹ a che fare con lâ€™arte e lâ€™innovazione che con il produrre articoli indossabili; inoltre lâ€™alta moda produce oggetti di lusso molto costosi e fuori dalla portata della maggior parte di noi.

The EDGE-CALIFA Survey: Exploring the Star Formation Law through Variable Selection.,"We present a multilinear analysis to determine the significant predictors of star formation in galaxies using the combined EDGE-CALIFA sample of galaxies. We analyze 1845 kpc-scale lines of sight across 39 galaxies with molecular line emission measurements from EDGE combined with optical IFU data drawn from CALIFA. We use the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to identify significant factors in predicting star formation rates. We find that the local star formation rate surface density is increased by higher molecular gas surface densities and stellar surface densities. In contrast, we see lower star formation rates in systems with older stellar populations, higher gas- and stellar-phase metallicities and larger galaxy masses. We also find a significant increase in star formation rate with galactocentric radius normalized by the disk scale length, which suggests additional parameters regulating star formation rate not explored in this study.",2019,arXiv: Astrophysics of Galaxies
"Petrography and metamorphism of the SÃ¤Ã¤ksjÃ¤rvi ultramafic body, Southwest Finland","SummaryThe 1.89 Ga SÃ¤Ã¤ksjÃ¤rvi ultramafic body, comprising metaperidotite and subordinate amphibolite, is hosted by multiply deformed upper amphibolite to granulite facies rocks. Prograde peak metamorphic (M2) mineral assemblages in the metaperidotite comprise olivine + Ca-amphibole Â± orthopyroxene Â± Cr-spinel. Ca-amphibole exists as porphyroblastic, finer grained sub-idioblastic, and nematoblastic forms, the latter two overprinting and partly replacing the former. The porphyroblasts crystallized under P-T conditions of at least 650 Â°C and 5 Â± 1 kb, based on solvus-closing in the Ca-amphibole system. On textural evidence, peak metamorphism crossed the Ca-amphibole + olivine (Fo76 â€“ 82) = orthopyroxene (En77 â€“ 81) + water reaction isograd at 700 Â°C and 4.5 to 5 kb. Metamorphism peaked between the â€œMg-chlorite-outâ€ reaction isograd at 720 Â°C and 5 kb and the slightly higher thermal stability limit of Al-rich â€œblack-wallâ€ chlorite. This accords with the absence of prograde Mg-chlorite and the presence of Al-rich chrome spinel (Al2O3 = 21 to 30 wt%) in the metaperidotite.The amphibolite comprises calcic amphibole with cummingtonite exsolution lamellae, minor plagioclase, quartz, albite and Fe-Mg cummingtonite. Upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies retrograde conditions (M3) are recorded in amphibolite by: i) re-equilibration of plagioclase to quartz and albite (600 to 620 Â°C derived from the amphibole-plagioclase geothermometer); ii) 580 to 600 Â°C obtained from the phase relations of coexisting actinolitic hornblende and cummingtonite; and iii) 610 to 640 Â°C obtained from spinel-olivine Fe-Mg exchange data in metaperidotite. The range of temperatures is equally consistent with protracted reequilibration of the high-temperature M2, or with a discrete M3 event. In the metaperidotite, porphyroblastic amphibole (M2) partly recrystallized to matrix-grains and nematoblastic amphibole under â€œpeakâ€ retrograde conditions (M3).ZusammenfassungDer 1.89 Ga alte SÃ¤Ã¤ksjÃ¤rvi Ultramafit umfaÃŸt Metaperidotite und untergeordnet Amphibolite in vielfach deformierten Metamorphiten der oberen Amphibolit- bis Granulit-Fazies. Prograde Mineralassoziationen des Metamorphose-Peaks M2 in den Metaperidotiten umfassen Olivin + Ca-Amphibol Â± Orthopyroxen Â± Cr-Spinel. Ca-Amphibole kommen als porphyroblastische, feinerkÃ¶rnige subidioblastische und als nematoblastische Kristalle vor; die letzten beiden Ã¼berprÃ¤gen und verdrÃ¤ngen zum Teil die ersteren. Die Porphyroblasten kristallisierten bei P-T Bedingungen von mind. 650 Â°C und 5 Â± 1 Kbar; diese Daten basieren auf der SchlieÃŸung des Solvus im Ca-Amphibol-System. Texturelle Beobachtungen zeigen, daÃŸ die Peak-Metamorphose die Reaktionsisograde Ca-Amphibol + Olivin (Fo76 â€“ 82) Orthopyroxen plus Wasser bei 700 Â°C und 4.5â€“5 Kbar Ã¼berschritten hat. Der HÃ¶hepunkt der Metamorphose war zwischen der â€žMg-Chlorit-Outâ€ Reaktionsisograde bei 720 Â°C und 5 Kbar und der etwas hÃ¶heren thermalen StabilitÃ¤tsgrenze von aluminiumreichen â€žblack-wallâ€ Chloriten erreicht. Dies stimmt gut mit dem Fehlen von Mg-Chlorit und der Anwesenheit von Al-reichem Chromspinell (Al2O3 = 21 bis 30 Gew.%) im Metaperidotit Ã¼berein.Der Amphibolit umfaÃŸt Ca-Amphibole mit Entmischungen von Cummingtonitlamellen, etwas Plagioklas, Quarz, Albit und Fe-Mg Cummingtonit. Hinweise auf retrograde Metamorphose (M3) in der oberen GrÃ¼nschiefer- bis zur unteren Amphibolit-Fazies werden gegeben durch i) Reequilibrierung von Plagioklas zu Quarz und Albit (600â€“620 Â°C, auf Basis des Amphibol-Plagioklas Geothermometers) ii) 580â€“600 Â°C auf Basis der Phasenbeziehungen koexistierender Hornblende und Cummingtonit und iii) 610â€“640 Â°C auf Basis des Fe-Mg Austausches von Spinel und Olivin im Metaperidotit. Die Temperaturen stimmen entweder mit einer ausgedehnten Reequilibrierung des Hochtemperaturereignisses M2 oder mit einem selbststÃ¤ndigen M3 Metamorphoseereignis Ã¼berein. Im Metaperidotit rekristallisierte porphyroblastischer Amphibol (M2) teilweise zu MatrixkÃ¶rnern und zu nematoblastischem Amphibol unter â€žPeakâ€ retrograden Bedingungen.",1996,Mineralogy and Petrology
Germ Cell-Specific Gene 1-Like Protein Regulated by Splicing Factor CUGBP Elav-Like Family Member 5 and Primary Bile Acid Biosynthesis are Prognostic in Glioblastoma Multiforme,"Background Alternative splicing (AS) modifies 92-94% human genes, abnormal splicing events might relate to tumor development and invasion. Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a fatal, invasive, and malignant tumor in nervous system. The recurrence and development leads to poor prognosis. However, few studies have focused on AS in GBM. Methods RNA-seq and Alternative splicing events (ASEs) data of GBM samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and TCGASpliceSeq databases, respectively. Firstly, the Cox regression analysis was utilized to identify the overall survival splicing events (OS-SEs). Secondly, a multivariable model was applied to access the prognostic value of risk score. Then, we constructed a co-expressed network between splicing factors (SFs) and overall survival alternative splicing events (OS-SEs). Additionally, to explore the relationship between the potential prognostic signaling pathways and OS-SEs, we constructed a network between these pathways and OS-SEs. Ultimately, to better explain the results, validations from multi-dimension platforms were applied. Results In the first step, 1,062 OS-SEs were selected by Cox regression. Then, 11 OS-SEs were integrated in a multivariate model by Lasso regression. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.861. In addition, the risk score generated from the multivariate model was confirmed to be an independent prognostic factor (P < 0.001). What's more, in the network of SFs and ASEs, CELF5 significantly regulated GSG1L|35696|AP and GSG1L|35698|AP (P < 0.001, R = 0.511 and = -0.492). Additionally, GSG1L|35696|AP (P = 0.006) and GSG1L|35698|AP (P = 0.007) showed a significant relationship with cancer status. Eventually, KEGG pathways related to prognosis of GBM were selected by GSVA. The primary bile acid synthesis (P < 0.001, R = 0.420) was the significant pathway co-expressed with Germ Cell-Specific Gene 1-Like Protein (GSG1L). Conclusions Based on the comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, we proposed that aberrant splicing factor CUGBP Elav-like family member 5 (CELF5) significantly, positively and negatively, regulated ASE of GSG1L, and the primary bile acid synthesis pathway might play an important role in tumorigenesis and prognosis of GBM.",2019,Frontiers in Genetics
Copula-Based Multi-Dimensional Crowdsourced Data Synthesis and Release with Local Privacy,"Various paradigms, based on differential privacy, have been proposed to release a privacy-preserving dataset with statistical approximation. Nonetheless, most existing schemes are limited when facing highly correlated attributes, and cannot prevent privacy threats from untrusted servers. In this paper, we propose a novel Copula- based scheme to efficiently synthesize and release multi-dimensional crowdsourced data with local differential privacy. In our scheme, each participant's (or user's) data is locally transformed into bit strings based on a randomized response technique, which guarantees a participant's privacy on the participant (user) side. Then, Copula theory is leveraged to synthesize multi-dimensional crowdsourced data based on univariate marginal distribution and attribute dependence. Univariate marginal distribution is estimated by the Lasso-based regression algorithm from the aggregated privacy- preserving bit strings. Dependencies among attributes are modeled as multivariate Gaussian Copula, of which parameter is estimated by Pearson correlation coefficients. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our scheme. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is effective for the release of multi-dimensional data with local differential privacy guaranteed to distributed participants.",2017,GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference
Robust Group Fused Lasso for Multisample CNV Detection under Uncertainty,"One of the most important needs in the post-genome era is providing the researchers with reliable and efficient computational tools to extract and analyze this huge amount of biological data, in which DNA copy number variation (CNV) is a vitally important one. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a common approach in order to detect CNVs. Most of methods for this purpose were proposed for one-dimensional profile. However, slightly this focus has moved from one- to multi-dimensional signals. In addition, since contamination of these profiles with noise is always an issue, it is highly important to have a robust method for analyzing multi-sample aCGH data. In this paper, we propose Robust Grouped Fused Lasso (RGFL) which utilizes the Robust Group Total Variations (RGTV). Instead of l2,1 norm, the l1-l2 M-estimator is used which is more robust in dealing with non-Gaussian noise and high corruption. More importantly, Correntropy (Welsch M-estimator) is also applied for fitting error. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the art algorithms and techniques under a wide range of scenarios with diverse noises.",2015,bioRxiv

Don't Fall for Tuning Parameters: Tuning-Free Variable Selection in High Dimensions With the TREX,"Lasso is a popular method for high-dimensional variable selection, but it hinges on a tuning parameter that is difficult to calibrate in practice. In this study, we introduce TREX, an alternative to Lasso with an inherent calibration to all aspects of the model. This adaptation to the entire model renders TREX an estimator that does not require any calibration of tuning parameters. We show that TREX can outperform cross-validated Lasso in terms of variable selection and computational efficiency. We also introduce a bootstrapped version of TREX that can further improve variable selection. We illustrate the promising performance of TREX both on synthetic data and on two biological data sets from the fields of genomics and proteomics.",2015,
Regression techniques employing feature selection to predict clinical outcomes in stroke,"It is not fully clear which measurable factors can reliably predict chronic stroke patients' recovery of motor ability. In this analysis, we investigate the impact of patient demographic characteristics, movement features, and a three-week upper-extremity intervention on the post-treatment change in two widely used clinical outcomes-the Upper Extremity portion of the Fugl-Meyer and the Wolf Motor Function Test. Models based on LASSO, which in validation tests account for 65% and 86% of the variability in Fugl-Meyer and Wolf, respectively, were used to identify the set of salient demographic and movement features. We found that age, affected limb, and several measures describing the patient's ability to efficiently direct motions with a single burst of speed were the most consequential in predicting clinical recovery. On the other hand, the upper-extremity intervention was not a significant predictor of recovery. Beyond a simple prognostic tool, these results suggest that focusing therapy on the more important features is likely to improve recovery. Such validation-intensive methods are a novel approach to determining the relative importance of patient-specific metrics and may help guide the design of customized therapy.",2018,PLoS ONE

As compared to previous computational designs, ourapproach is truly 2-D and yields more orientation selective detectors.We then address the estimation of the global shape from an image. Specif-ically, we propose to use cubic-spline-based parametric active contour modelsto solve two shape-extraction problems: (i) the segmentation of closed objectsand (ii) the 3-D reconstruction of DNA ï¬laments from their stereo cryo-electronmicrographs. We present several enhancements of existing snake algorithms forsegmentation. For the detection of 3-D DNA ï¬laments from their orthogonalprojections, we introduce the concept of projection-steerable matched ï¬ltering.We then use a 3-D snake algorithm to reconstruct the shape.Next, we analyze the eï¬ƒciency of curve representations using reï¬nable basisfunctions for the description of shape boundaries. We derive an exact expressionfor the error when we approximate a periodic signal in a scaling-function basis.Finally, we present a method for the exact computation of the area moments ofsuch shapes.i",2003,
"Prevalence and distribution of the dinoflagellate Thalassomyces californiensis Collard, 1966 (Ellobiopsidae) on Pasiphaea emarginata Rathbun, 1902 (Decapoda, Caridea, Pasiphaeidae), off western Mexico","A large series of 96 specimens (79 females, 13 ovigerous females, and 3 males; 1 unsexed specimen) of Pasiphaea emarginata Rathbun, 1902, was collected off western Mexico, mostly during the TALUD project aimed at the study of deep-water benthic and pelagic species. The external dinoflagellate parasite Thalassomyces californiensis Collard, 1966 (Ellobiopsidae) was observed on the eyes of 41 specimens, but was notably absent in ovigerous females (13 specimens), while it infested 45.2% of the non-ovigerous females. Two of the three males captured were infested (one with the parasite on both eyes, the other only on the left eye). In non-gravid females, the parasite was located either on the left eye (16 cases), on the right eye (18 cases) or on both eyes (4 cases). Based on the material examined, the number of known localities for Pasiphaea emarginata is increased from three to 24 and to a new southernmost limit off SW Mexico, while the records for T. californiensis are the first for the entire Gulf of California.",2013,Crustaceana
"Convex Regression: Theory, Practice, and Applications","This thesis explores theoretical, computational, and practical aspects of convex (shape-constrained) regression, providing new excess risk upper bounds, a comparison of convex regression techniques with theoretical guarantee, a novel heuristic training algorithm for max-affine representations, and applications in convex stochastic programming. The new excess risk upper bound is developed for the general empirical risk minimization setting without any shape constraints, and provides a probabilistic guarantee for cases with unbounded hypothesis classes, targets, and noise models. The strength of the general result is demonstrated by applying it to linear regression under the squared loss both for lasso and ridge regression, as well as for convex nonparametric least squares estimation, in each case allowing one to obtain near-minimax upper bounds on the risk. Next, cutting plane and alternating direction method of multipliers algorithms are compared for training the max-affine least squares estimators; estimators for which we provide explicit excess risk bounds. These techniques are also extended for the partitioned convex formulation (which is shown to enjoy optimal minimax rates). We also provide an empirical study of various heuristics for solving the non-convex optimization problem underlying the partitioned convex formulation. A novel max-affine estimator is designed, which scales well for large sample sizes and improves the generalization error of current techniques in many cases. Its training time is proportional to the adaptively set model size, making it computationally attractive for estimation problems where the target can be efficiently approximated by max-affine functions. Realistic convex regression applications are synthetized for the convex stochastic programming framework such as an energy storage optimization using a solar source with an Economy 7 tariff pricing model, as well as a multi-product assembly problem of operating a beer brewery.",2016,
A survey of ocular ultrasound abnormalities in horse: 145 cases,"PurposeTo describe the association of clinical and ultrasonographic (US) findings in horses affected by visual impairments, to estimate the most frequent ultrasonographic alteration as well importance and limits of US as a part of ophthalmic evaluation in equine patients.MethodsOne-hundred-forty-five horses referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospitals of the University of Perugia and Camerino for ocular problems were submitted to ophthalmic examination and ocular ultrasound. The following group of abnormalities was established: corneal alteration, cataract, synechiae, iris prolapse, anterior chamber alterations, vitreous opacities, globe reduction, globe enlargement, retinal detachment, lens subluxation/luxation, lens rupture, intraocular masses, retrobulbar masses. Specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive value and related 95% confidence interval were calculated. Kappa value was estimated for concordance evaluation.ResultsA total of 384 clinical alterations were observed during ophthalmological examination, while 357 were found by ultrasound investigation. A very good agreement was found for lens subluxation/luxation, intraocular masses, iris prolapse, globe enlargement, lens rupture, vitreous opacities and cataract. Moderate agreement was found for retinal detachment, anterior chamber alterations and synechiae. Corneal alteration and globe reduction resulted in a fair and poor agreement, respectively.ConclusionsUltrasonography affords the benefit of providing a complete cross-sectional view of the eyeball, facilitating the identification of ocular diseases in cases of loss of transparency of ocular media. It also represents an indispensable aid whenever anterior opacification precludes the use of ophthalmoscopic or biomicroscopic examination techniques.SommarioObiettiviDescrivere lâ€™associazione tra reperti clinici ed ultrasonografici in cavalli affetti da alterazioni della visione, valutare i piÃ¹ frequenti reperti ultrasonografici e lâ€™importanza ed i limiti dellâ€™ultrasonografia come parte della valutazione oftalmologica nel cavallo.MetodiCentoquarantacinque cavalli riferiti allâ€™ospedale Veterinario Didattico dellâ€™UniversitÃ  di Perugia e di Camerino per patologie oculari sono stati sottoposti a valutazione clinica e a ultrasonografia oculare. Le alterazioni sono state suddivise nelle seguenti categorie: lesioni corneali, cataratta, sinechie, prolasso dellâ€™iride, alterazioni della camera anteriore, opacitÃ  vitreali, riduzione dimensioni globo, aumento dimensioni globo, distacco retinico, lussazione/sublussazione del cristallino, rottura della lente, masse intraoculari, masse retrobulbari.

The metabolites urobilin and sphingomyelin (30:1) are associated with incident heart failure in the general population,"AIMS
We aimed to investigate whether metabolomic profiling of blood can lead to novel insights into heart failure pathogenesis or improved risk prediction.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling was performed in plasma or serum samples from three community-based cohorts without heart failure at baseline (total nÂ =Â 3924; 341 incident heart failure events; median follow-up ranging from 4.6 to 13.9Â years). Cox proportional hazard models were applied to assess the association of each of the 206 identified metabolites with incident heart failure in the discovery cohorts Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) (nÂ =Â 920) and Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) (nÂ =Â 1121). Replication was undertaken in the independent cohort TwinGene (nÂ =Â 1797). We also assessed whether metabolites could improve the prediction of heart failure beyond established risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, lipid medication, diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood pressure medication, glomerular filtration rate, smoking status, and myocardial infarction prior to or during follow-up). Higher circulating urobilin and lower sphingomyelin (30:1) were associated with incident heart failure in age-adjusted and sex-adjusted models in the discovery and replication sample. The hazard ratio for urobilin in the replication cohort was estimated to 1.29 per standard deviation unit, 95% confidence interval (CI 1.03-1.63), and for sphingomyelin (30:1) to 0.72 (95% CI 0.58-0.89). Results remained similar after further adjustment for established heart failure risk factors in meta-analyses of all three cohorts. Urobilin concentrations were inversely associated with left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline in the PIVUS cohort (Î²Â =Â -0.70, 95% CI -1.03 to -0.38). No major improvement in risk prediction was observed when adding the top 2 metabolites (C-index 0.787, 95% CI 0.752-0.823) or nine Lasso-selected metabolites (0.790, 95% CI 0.754-0.826) to a modified Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities heart failure risk score model (0.780, 95% CI 0.745-0.816).


CONCLUSIONS
Our metabolomic profiling of three community-based cohorts study identified associations of circulating levels of the haem breakdown product urobilin, and sphingomyelin (30:1), a cell membrane component involved in signal transduction and apoptosis, with incident heart failure.",2019,ESC Heart Failure
CCLasso: correlation inference for compositional data through Lasso,"MOTIVATION
Direct analysis of microbial communities in the environment and human body has become more convenient and reliable owing to the advancements of high-throughput sequencing techniques for 16S rRNA gene profiling. Inferring the correlation relationship among members of microbial communities is of fundamental importance for genomic survey study. Traditional Pearson correlation analysis treating the observed data as absolute abundances of the microbes may lead to spurious results because the data only represent relative abundances. Special care and appropriate methods are required prior to correlation analysis for these compositional data.


RESULTS
In this article, we first discuss the correlation definition of latent variables for compositional data. We then propose a novel method called CCLasso based on least squares with [Formula: see text] penalty to infer the correlation network for latent variables of compositional data from metagenomic data. An effective alternating direction algorithm from augmented Lagrangian method is used to solve the optimization problem. The simulation results show that CCLasso outperforms existing methods, e.g. SparCC, in edge recovery for compositional data. It also compares well with SparCC in estimating correlation network of microbe species from the Human Microbiome Project.

"Recursive â„“1, âˆž Group Lasso","We introduce a recursive adaptive group lasso algorithm for real-time penalized least squares prediction that produces a time sequence of optimal sparse predictor coefficient vectors. At each time index the proposed algorithm computes an exact update of the optimal `1,âˆž-penalized recursive least squares (RLS) predictor. Each update minimizes a convex but nondifferentiable function optimization problem. We develop an online homotopy method to reduce the computational complexity. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the `1 regularized RLS algorithm for a group sparse system identification problem and has lower implementation complexity than direct group lasso solvers.",2012,IEEE Trans.

Machine-learning to characterise neonatal functional connectivity in the preterm brain,"Brain development is adversely affected by preterm birth. Magnetic resonance image analysis has revealed a complex fusion of structural alterations across all tissue compartments that are apparent by term-equivalent age, persistent into adolescence and adulthood, and associated with wide-ranging neurodevelopment disorders. Although functional MRI has revealed the relatively advanced organisational state of the neonatal brain, the full extent and nature of functional disruptions following preterm birth remain unclear. In this study, we apply machine-learning methods to compare whole-brain functional connectivity in preterm infants at term-equivalent age and healthy term-born neonates in order to test the hypothesis that preterm birth results in specific alterations to functional connectivity by term-equivalent age. Functional connectivity networks were estimated in 105 preterm infants and 26 term controls using group-independent component analysis and a graphical lasso model. A random forest-based feature selection method was used to identify discriminative edges within each network and a nonlinear support vector machine was used to classify subjects based on functional connectivity alone. We achieved 80% cross-validated classification accuracy informed by a small set of discriminative edges. These edges connected a number of functional nodes in subcortical and cortical grey matter, and most were stronger in term neonates compared to those born preterm. Half of the discriminative edges connected one or more nodes within the basal ganglia. These results demonstrate that functional connectivity in the preterm brain is significantly altered by term-equivalent age, confirming previous reports of altered connectivity between subcortical structures and higher-level association cortex following preterm birth.",2016,Neuroimage
Local modeling approaches for estimating soil properties in selected Indian soils using diffuse reflectance data over visible to near-infrared region,"Abstract Robust calibration algorithms are needed for the accurate assessment of soil properties in the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) approach. Despite several studies on different calibration algorithms, the prediction accuracy of soil properties using DRS need to be improved. Specifically, the utility of local modeling approaches for small spectral libraries is less examined compared with global modeling approaches. In this study, we compared global modeling approaches such as partial-least-squares regression (PLSR), lasso, ridge regression with several locally-weighted PLSR (PLSR LW ) approaches. We also examined seven different distance measures: Euclidean distance, covariance-based distance, correlation-based distance, surface difference spectrum, information-based distance, optimized principal component Mahalanobis, and locally-linear embeddings used in the PLSR LW approach for their effectiveness in modeling soil properties using DRS. A total of 954 soil samples were collected from three different states of India: West Bengal, Odisha, and Karnataka. Five soil properties such as sand content, clay content, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, extractable iron (Fe) content and extractable zinc (Zn) content were predicted using reflectance spectra over 350â€“2500â€¯nm. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) were used as performance statistics. Among the global modeling approaches, lasso performed better than the PLSR although it is computationally more intensive than the PLSR. In general, the correlation-based PLSR LW performed significantly better than the global approaches. Specifically, the test R 2 values increased from 0.66 to 0.72 for prediction of sand content, from 0.59 to 0.70 for prediction of SOC content, and from 0.70 to 0.74 for prediction of Fe content by using the PLSR LW over PLSR. We also used depth of absorption peak of spectra at approximately 1400, 1900 and 2200â€¯nm for mineralogical characterization of soil samples. The results suggested that the improvement in prediction accuracy of soil properties using the PLSR LW was achieved because calibration samples which had same mineralogy as the test sample were given higher weights. These results suggest that the prediction accuracy of soil properties may also be improved in small spectral libraries if an appropriate local modeling scheme is selected.",2018,Geoderma
"Captives or Slaves and Masters in Eivissa (Ibiza), 1235â€“1600","This article concerns captivity or slavery on the island of Eivissa (Ibiza) from the time of its conquest by Christians until the end of the sixteenth century. Captives were used to cultivate and harvest vineyards and to labor on public building works in accordance to the strict calendar for agricultural and salt production. The sources have been examined for quantitative data and for the identity of their masters. They contain valuable information on the characteristics of these captives (sex, origins) and on their mode of arrival to the island. Slave masters have also been evaluated in search of common features, such as economic position, political offices held, and properties owned. These data have been used to test Claude Meillassouxâ€™s (1986) definition of slavery. Simultaneously, Charles Verlindenâ€™s work has also been analyzed, with special regard to the motivation behind his turning of what the medieval sources referred to as â€œcaptivesâ€ into â€œslaves.â€",2016,Medieval Encounters
Population Persistence and Reproductive Ecology of a Forest Herb: Aster Acuminatus,"Aster acuminatus Michaux, a patchily distributed herb of eastem forests, is commonly represented in all stages of forest succession. To determine its mechanisms of persistence, we carefully examined the distribution pattems ofthis species as affected by its reproductive ecology and demography. Using A. acuminatus as a model, we hypothesized that 1) availability of propagules and location of adequate recruitment sites impose first-order control over plant distributions in stands of all ages by determining where plants might be found and 2) light and other resources exert a second-order control over herb distributions by determining where established plants cannot persist. Results from our study at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire demonstrated this species' ability to exploit resource-rich disturbances through immediate and profuse ramet and seed production. This ensured rapid colonization of new sites and provided genetic exchange for longer-term survival. Relict colonies which survived the disturbance served as the sole propagule-producing loci for the first year of colonization. After several years, resources became more limiting and the aster shifted to a more conservative asexual reproduction strategy which provided population stability until the next disturbance. The clumped distribution of A. acuminatus in mature forests is explained by strict adherence to asexual ramet replacement in which there is no year-to-year change in aster importance. Location of persistent colonies probably is dictated by location of suitable seedbeds during the first few years of recovery after disturbance. Whereas numerous sites may be colonized initially, timing of colonization and quality of site impose constraints on which colonies persist. IN THE UNDERSTORY of temperate forests, herbs generally are distributed in sparse clumps and patches (Watt, 1947), and species often are represented in all stages of forest succession (Grime, 1979). Herbs growing in mature forests exhibit life history traits and resource allocation patterns that are quite different from those of herbs inhabiting less stable environments (Struik, 1965; Kawano and Nagai, 1975). Most notably, forest herbs usually are smaller in size, rarely establish from seed, and generally make little investment in sexual reproduction (Tamm, 1956). These distinctive life history traits may favor their persistence in the resource-poor understory of a mature forest. Although most studies of plant distributions in the forest understory have focussed on the role of specific environmental variables in regulating patterns (e.g., light and water, Anderson, Loucks, and Swain, 1969; microtopog' Received for publication 26 February 1987; revision accepted 7 October 1987. We thank the following individuals for field assistance: Steve Compton, Tom Kowalski, Mou Pu, Scott Shipley, and Zhihua Xu. Drs. James P. Lassoie, Peter L. Marks, and two anonymous reviewers provided helpful comments on earlier versions of the manuscript. This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (BSR 83-16953). raphy, Bratton, 1976), we suspected that the reproductive ecology of forest herbs may be equally critical in determining herb distribution, abundance and long-term persistence. Through careful examination of the distribution patterns of a forest herb, as affected by its reproductive ecology and demography, we sought a better understanding of the factors which 1) cause clumped distributions of forest herbs, 2) limit their use of unoccupied sites, and 3) permit their persistence in many stages of forest succession. We used as a test species Aster acuminatus Michaux, the whorled wood aster, because it has been much discussed in the literature (e.g., Pitelka, Stanton, and Peckenham, 1980; Pitelka and Curtis, 1986) and has distribution patterns characteristic of other forest herbs (Siccama, Bormann, and Likens, 1970). In this paper we show how life history traits and population dynamics ofA. acuminatus are directed by the interaction of resource and propagule availability and how distribution patterns ultimately are determined by the predisturbance patterns of distribution within the forest. We hypothesize that light and other resources are of second-order importance in that they do not determine the location of patches, but rather where they cannot be located.

Thinking the Earth: Critical Reflections on Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s and Heideggerâ€™s Concept of the Earth,"Quentin Meillassoux's call for realism is a call for a new interest in the Earth as un-correlated being in philosophy. Unlike Meillassoux, Martin Heidegger has not been criticized for being a correlationist. To the contrary, his concept of the Earth has to be understood as un-correlated being, as it is opposed to the world as correlated being. First, this interpretation of Heidegger's concept of the Earth solves various problems of interpretation that are present in the secondary literature. Second, Heidegger's characterization of the Earth in the end remains unthought in his work. Third, in the age of global warming Meillassoux's call for realism can help to conceive planet Earth as the ontic-ontological origin of the Heideggerian strife between Earth and world.",2016,Environmental Ethics
Feedforward Control of Fan Noise in Ducts using Multichannel Order-reduced Inverse Filters,"Single-channel feedforward control is a commonly used approach for active noise control (ANC). In this paper, a time-domain underdetermined multichannel inverse filtering technique is proposed for the feedforward active control (ANC) of duct noise. In the commonly used filtered-x least-mean-square (FXLMS) algorithm, the feedforward control problem is formulated as an overdetermined inverse filtering problem which generally results in non-zero residual noise. By introducing multiple secondary sources, the problem can be reformulated into an underdetermined system, which admits infinite number of exact solutions with zero residual noise. Linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) method is employed in the controller design. However, as a major shortcoming of the time-domain approach, the length of the filters tends to be too long to admit digital signal processor (DSP) implementation. To address the problem, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, is exploited to effectively reduce the controller orders. A two-channel system is implemented to suppress the fan noise of an air-cleaner. Simulation and experiment results have demonstrated that the proposed approach has achieved significantly higher noise reduction than the conventional FXLMS algorithm.",2019,
Genomic Prediction Accuracy for Resistance Against Piscirickettsia salmonis in Farmed Rainbow Trout,"Salmonid rickettsial syndrome (SRS), caused by the intracellular bacterium Piscirickettsia salmonis, is one of the main diseases affecting rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farming. To accelerate genetic progress, genomic selection methods can be used as an effective approach to control the disease. The aims of this study were: (i) to compare the accuracy of estimated breeding values using pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (PBLUP) with genomic BLUP (GBLUP), single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP), Bayes C, and Bayesian Lasso (LASSO); and (ii) to test the accuracy of genomic prediction and PBLUP using different marker densities (0.5, 3, 10, 20, and 27 K) for resistance against P. salmonis in rainbow trout. Phenotypes were recorded as number of days to death (DD) and binary survival (BS) from 2416 fish challenged with P. salmonis A total of 1934 fish were genotyped using a 57 K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. All genomic prediction methods achieved higher accuracies than PBLUP. The relative increase in accuracy for different genomic models ranged from 28 to 41% for both DD and BS at 27 K SNP. Between different genomic models, the highest relative increase in accuracy was obtained with Bayes C (âˆ¼40%), where 3 K SNP was enough to achieve a similar accuracy to that of the 27 K SNP for both traits. For resistance against P. salmonis in rainbow trout, we showed that genomic predictions using GBLUP, ssGBLUP, Bayes C, and LASSO can increase accuracy compared with PBLUP. Moreover, it is possible to use relatively low-density SNP panels for genomic prediction without compromising accuracy predictions for resistance against P. salmonis in rainbow trout.",2018,G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics
A novel epigenetic signature for overall survival prediction in patients with breast cancer,"BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in female patients worldwide. Because of its heterogeneity in terms of prognosis and therapeutic response, biomarkers with the potential to predict survival or assist in making treatment decisions in breast cancer patients are essential for an individualised therapy. Epigenetic alterations in the genome of the cancer cells, such as changes in DNA methylation pattern, could be a novel marker with an important role in the initiation and progression of breast cancer.MethodDNA methylation and RNA-seq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox model. Applying gene ontology (GO) and single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) an epigenetic signature associated with the survival of breast cancer patients was constructed that yields the best discrimination between tumour and normal breast tissue. A predictive nomogram was built for the optimal strategy to distinguish between high- and low-risk cases.ResultsThe combination of mRNA-expression and of DNA methylation datasets yielded a 13-gene epigenetic signature that identified subset of breast cancer patients with low overall survival. This high-risk group of tumor cases was marked by upregulation of known cancer-related pathways (e.g. mTOR signalling). Subgroup analysis indicated that this epigenetic signature could distinguish high and low-risk patients also in different molecular or histological tumour subtypes (by Her2-, EGFR- or ER expression or different tumour grades). Using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) the 13-gene signature was confirmed in four external breast cancer cohorts.ConclusionAn epigenetic signature was discovered that effectively stratifies breast cancer patients into low and high-risk groups. Since its efficiency appears independent of other known classifiers (such as staging, histology, metastasis status, receptor status), it has a high potential to further improve likely individualised therapy in breast cancer.",2019,Journal of Translational Medicine
Variable Selection and Spatial Models for Identifying Chemical Plumes in Hyperspectral Imagery,"Author(s): Mendoza, Nicole Andree | Advisor(s): Rodriguez, Abel | Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging is a remote sensing technique widely used in a variety of military and environmental applications. For example, hyperspectral images can be used to detect chemical plumes invisible to the human eye, and to identify their chemical structure. A hyperspectral image is a massive cube of data consisting of thousands of pixels each with dozens of observations over a range of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum. Algorithms that use hypothesis testing and assume independence over pixels have shown success in detecting gas clouds, but often fail in identifying chemical components. We approach identification problems in hyperspectral imaging as a variable selection problem, which can be solved robustly by taking advantage of spatial information in the image. For this purpose we develop Bayesian spatial model selection algorithms which use mixtures of g-priors, Gaussian Markov Random Fields, and Gaussian Process Priors to account for correlation among chemicals, to induce spatial dependence among pixels, and to account for nonlinearities in pixel signals. To illustrate the performance of the models we apply them to several partially synthesized hyperspectral images and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, such as the LASSO and Fused LASSO.",2018,
Bayesian Hyperâ€lassos with Nonâ€convex Penalization,"Summary 
 
The Lasso has sparked interest in the use of penalization of the log-likelihood for variable selection, as well as for shrinkage. We are particularly interested in the more-variables-than-observations case of characteristic importance for modern data. The Bayesian interpretation of the Lasso as the maximum a posteriori estimate of the regression coefficients, which have been given independent, double exponential prior distributions, is adopted. Generalizing this prior provides a family of hyper-Lasso penalty functions, which includes the quasi-Cauchy distribution of Johnstone and Silverman as a special case. The properties of this approach, including the oracle property, are explored, and an EM algorithm for inference in regression problems is described. The posterior is multi-modal, and we suggest a strategy of using a set of perfectly fitting random starting values to explore modes in different regions of the parameter space. Simulations show that our procedure provides significant improvements on a range of established procedures, and we provide an example from chemometrics.",2011,Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics
Plastic deformation in nanoindentation of tantalum: A new mechanism for prismatic loop formation,"Abstract The mechanisms of deformation under a nanoindentation in tantalum, chosen as a model body-centered cubic (bcc) metal, are identified and quantified. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and indentation experiments are conducted for [1Â 0Â 0], [1Â 1Â 0] and [1Â 1Â 1] normals to surface orientations. The simulated plastic deformation proceeds by the formation of nanotwins, which rapidly evolve into shear dislocation loops. It is shown through a dislocation analysis that an elementary twin (three layers) is energetically favorable for a diameter below âˆ¼7Â nm, at which point a shear loop comprising a perfect dislocation is formed. MD simulations show that shear loops expand into the material by the advancement of their edge components. Simultaneously with this advancement, screw components of the loop cross-slip and generate a cylindrical surface. When opposite segments approach, they eventually cancel by virtue of the attraction between them, forming a quasi-circular prismatic loop composed of edge dislocation segments. This â€œlassoâ€-like mechanism by which a shear loop transitions to a prismatic loop is identified for both [0Â 0Â 1] and [1Â 1Â 1] indentations. The prismatic loops advance into the material along ã€ˆ1Â 1Â 1ã€‰ directions, transporting material away from the nucleation site. Analytical calculations supplement MD and experimental observations, and provide a framework for the improved understanding of the evolution of plastic deformation under a nanoindenter. Dislocation densities under the indenter are estimated experimentally (âˆ¼1.2Â Ã—Â 1015Â mâˆ’2), by MD (âˆ¼7Â Ã—Â 1015Â mâˆ’2) and through an analytical calculation (2.6â€“19Â Ã—Â 1015Â mâˆ’2). Considering the assumptions and simplifications, this agreement is considered satisfactory. MD simulations also show expected changes in pile-up symmetry after unloading, compatible with crystal plasticity.",2014,Acta Materialia
Predictive value of angiogenesis-related gene profiling in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treated with bevacizumab and weekly paclitaxel (Bev-Pac).,"564 Background: The combination of Bev-Pac significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), compared with Pac alone in first-line treatment of HER2-negative MBC. To date only a few biomarkers relating to bevacizumab efficacy have been published, and none of them have been validated in prospective studies. The aim of this study is to build a profile predicting PFS in patients treated with Bev-Pac. Methods: 60 patients with Her2-negative MBC treated with Bev-Pac were included. RNAs were collected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary breast samples. Expression levels of 170 angiogenesis related genes were measured using quantitative real time PCR.

Optimal risk minimization of Australian energy and mining portfolios of stocks under multiple measures of risk,"Australiaâ€™s 2000â€™s decade saw the sharpest rise in mining investments arising from developing Asian emerging economiesâ€™ high demand for commodities like coal, iron ore, nickel, oil and gas which drove up prices to a historic level (Connolly & Orsmond, 2011). As of December 2012, 39 % and 9 % of the Australian Securities Exchangeâ€™s stocks were of the mining (coal and uranium stocks are included in this category) and energy (e.g. oil, gas and renewable energy stocks) sectors respectively, and investors recently have been considering separate portfolio positions in energy and mining stocks (Jennings, 2010). Facts of these nature set the stage for the task of selecting an optimal portfolio of stock securities where the fundamental questions faced by every investor, individual or institutional, are: a) what is the optimal point in time to go long in the investment position?, b) what are the optimal amounts to invest in every asset of a portfolio? and, c) when is the optimal time to short the portfolio investment position? The focus of the present study is on b) within a one period ahead forecast scenario. Understanding the price and volatility movements of stock securities taking as a basis of study their own dynamics and co-dynamics is a complex task that may be better addressed through a multilateral modelling approach. This paper, in this regard, departs from a single model application by fitting multiple risk measures to the optimization of four portfolios each consisting of 20 ASXâ€™s stocks from the gold, iron ore-nickel, uranium-coal and oil-gas sectors. The five risk measures compared are: the variance, mean absolute deviation (MAD), minimizing regret (Minimax), conditional value at risk (CVaR), and conditional drawdown at risk (CDaR), where the last two are threshold based measures. The risk measure parameters are input into meanvariance quadratic (QP) and differential evolution (DE) portfolio problem specifications. Accurate estimations of the underlying interaction of stocks return series is a crucial element in portfolio allocation and portfolio risk management and frequentist traditional measures of dependence are rather inadequate. Here, with the objective of achieving more accuracy in the estimation of the dependence matrix, a Gaussian pair c-vine copula (PC), the regular graphical lasso (RL) and adaptive graphical lasso (AL) are fitted. Possible advantages from using these recently proposed and sophisticated techniques under model specifications where the covariance matrix is the measure of risk are indicated. The main objectives of the present study are to calculate the optimal weights to be invested in every stock of the portfolios making use of linear and nonlinear model specifications and the risk measures suggested, analyse the weight allocation differences and seek portfolio optimization advantages from using pair vine copulas and the graphical lasso in the estimation of dependence. The present multimodal approach is, therefore, expected to be more robust and as a consequence, provide more complete information that could serve for improved decision making on portfolio selection, allocation and rebalancing. Research questions are answered based on the analysis of gold portfolio outcome values, only. Findings indicate that CDaR is an important risk measure to be considered, along with other measures of risk when optimizing portfolios of stocks and no single measure of risk is suggested alone. The Gaussian pair cvine copula through the use of one different parameter in the modelling of every pair of variablesâ€™ joint distribution appears to be more sensitive in capturing dataâ€™s distribution characteristics. The adaptive graphical lasso also appears to be more perceptive when grasping the signal of the underlying interaction of the stocks. Therefore, valuable information could be drawn and inferred from applying multiple risk measures and sophisticated statistical techniques for their estimation. The weight allocation from threshold risk measures such as CVar and DaR and Minimax clearly differs from the rest. The models identified stocks with high return relative to risk and vice versa. The originality of the present study lies on the sectors of application and its multi-model nature.",2013,
Hyperspectral Leaf Reflectance as Proxy for Photosynthetic Capacities: An Ensemble Approach Based on Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms,"Global agriculture production is challenged by increasing demands from rising population and a changing climate, which may be alleviated through development of genetically improved crop cultivars. Research into increasing photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency has proposed many strategies to improve production but have yet to yield real-world solutions, largely because of a phenotyping bottleneck. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is a statistical technique that is increasingly used to relate hyperspectral reflectance to key photosynthetic capacities associated with carbon uptake (maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco, Vc,max ) and conversion of light energy (maximum electron transport rate supporting RuBP regeneration, Jmax ) to alleviate this bottleneck. However, its performance varies significantly across different plant species, regions, and growth environments. Thus, to cope with the heterogeneous performances of PLSR, this study aims to develop a new approach to estimate photosynthetic capacities. A framework was developed that combines six machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest (RF), Gaussian process (GP), and PLSR to optimize high-throughput analysis of the two photosynthetic variables. Six tobacco genotypes, including both transgenic and wild-type lines, with a range of photosynthetic capacities were used to test the framework. Leaf reflectance spectra were measured from 400 to 2500 nm using a high-spectral-resolution spectroradiometer. Corresponding photosynthesis vs. intercellular CO2 concentration response curves were measured for each leaf using a leaf gas-exchange system. Results suggested that the mean R 2 value of the six regression techniques for predicting Vc,max (Jmax ) ranged from 0.60 (0.45) to 0.65 (0.56) with the mean RMSE value varying from 47.1 (40.1) to 54.0 (44.7) Î¼mol m-2 s-1. Regression stacking for Vc,max (Jmax ) performed better than the individual regression techniques with increases in R 2 of 0.1 (0.08) and decreases in RMSE by 4.1 (6.6) Î¼mol m-2 s-1, equal to 8% (15%) reduction in RMSE. Better predictive performance of the regression stacking is likely attributed to the varying coefficients (or weights) in the level-2 model (the LASSO model) and the diverse ability of each individual regression technique to utilize spectral information for the best modeling performance. Further refinements can be made to apply this stacked regression technique to other plant phenotypic traits.",2019,Frontiers in Plant Science
Sparse pairwise Markov model learning for anomaly detection in heterogeneous data,"An important challenge in the aeronautic industry is to cope with maintenance issues of the products , notably detection and localization of components breakdowns. Modern equipments enjoy better recording and processing capacities, allowing the storage of a large amount of data, on which better maintenance systems are expected to be built. Efficient probabilistic models able to represent the statistic distribution of the collected variables in the "" normal state "" of the system are needed in order to derive anomaly detection algorithms. Graphical models constitute a rich class of models and are natural candidates to address this task. This article proposes a method for learning undirected hybrid graphical models from heterogeneous data. The data are heterogeneous as they include physical (quantitative) measures as well as a collection of inherently discrete variables for instance describing the state of electronic devices. The model we propose is adapted from the Ising and Gaussian models so that the data don't require to be translated from their original space, allowing the user to easily interpret the dependency graph learned from data. The learning step is carried out by minimizing the negative pseudo-log-likelihood using a proximal gradient algorithm with Lasso and group Lasso penalization for addressing the high dimension of variables. Once the model is learned, we use the penalized negative pseudo-log likelihood as a test statistics for detecting anomalous events.",2015,
Interpretable regularized class association rules algorithm for classification in a categorical data space,"Abstract Using association rules in classification is a great success which produces high accuracy classifiers. Even so, the principal advantage of the associative classifiers lies in interpretation. However, pruning the useless rules among the huge set of the mined rules as well as combining them to build a classifier remains a subject for improvement and further research. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm to build a classifier based on Regularized Class Association Rules in a categorical data space called RCAR. The characteristic of this algorithm is, therefore, threefold: First, mining an exhaustive set of Class Association Rules (CARs) according to a predefined values of support and confidence thresholds. Second, applying a regularized logistic regression algorithm with Lasso penalty on the rules space to build a model that predicts the conditional probability of the existence of the outcome. Useless rules are pruned thanks to the selective nature of Lasso regularization. Third, organizing and visualizing the CARs which survive the first step of pruning by Lasso regularization using metarules. An optional step of pruning could be undertaken on the basis of the metarules and subject knowledge. Likewise, the empirical results indicate that RCAR gives comparable accuracy against Random Forest and GBM.",2019,Inf. Sci.
Identifying Urban Areas by Combining Human Judgment and Machine Learning : An Application to India,"Abstract We propose a methodology for identifying urban areas that combines subjective assessments with machine learning, and we apply it to India, a country where several studies see the official urbanization rate as an under-estimate. For a representative sample of cities, towns and villages, as administratively defined, we rely on human judgment of Google images to determine whether they are urban or rural in practice. We collect judgments across four groups of assessors, differing in their familiarity with India and with urban issues, following two different protocols. We then combine the judgment-based classification with data from the population census and from satellite imagery to predict the urban status of the sample. The Logit model, and LASSO and random forests methods, are applied. These approaches are then used to decide whether each of the out-of-sample administrative units in India is urban or rural in practice. We do not find that India is substantially more urban than officially claimed. However, there are important differences at more disaggregated levels, with â€œother townsâ€ and â€œcensus townsâ€ being more rural, and some southern states more urban, than is officially claimed. The consistency of human judgment across assessors and protocols, the easy availability of crowd-sourcing, and the stability of predictions across approaches, suggest that the proposed methodology is a promising avenue for studying urban issues.",2019,Journal of Urban Economics
A Prevalent Peptide-Binding Domain Guides Ribosomal Natural Product Biosynthesis,"Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a rapidly growing class of natural products. RiPP precursor peptides can undergo extensive enzymatic tailoring to yield structurally and functionally diverse products, and their biosynthetic logic makes them attractive bioengineering targets. Recent work suggests that unrelated RiPP-modifying enzymes contain structurally similar precursor peptide-binding domains. Using profile hidden Markov model comparisons, we discovered related and previously unrecognized peptide-binding domains in proteins spanning the majority of known prokaryotic RiPP classes, and we named this conserved domain the RiPP precursor peptide recognition element (RRE). Through binding studies we verified RRE's roles for three distinct RiPP classes: linear azole-containing peptides, thiopeptides and lasso peptides. Because numerous RiPP biosynthetic enzymes act on peptide substrates, our findings have powerful predictive value as to which protein(s) drive substrate binding, thereby laying a foundation for further characterization of RiPP biosynthetic pathways and the rational engineering of new peptide-binding activities.",2015,Nature chemical biology

Platelet Rich Plasma for Traumatic Non-Union Fractures: A Novel butControversial Bone Regeneration Strategy.,"TheÂ Â Â  boneÂ Â  Â skeletonÂ  Â isÂ  Â theÂ Â  Â mainÂ Â  Â partÂ Â  Â of musculoskeletal system which serves as the basis of the loco-motor system. Although stubborn and stiff, the bony skeleton is the most vulnerable part of the loco-motor system to the trauma and high energy shuts. The ultimate result of the trauma to bones is the fracture or deformity. The bones have the Â potential Â of Â healing Â without Â scar Â formation; however Â the Â regenerative Â capacity Â of Â the Â bones is limited. The regeneration of large bone defects without intervention is a rare phenomenon, although some scientists have reported spontaneous healing of extensive bone defects [1]. Currently several strategies are available for treatment of large bone defects. The most recommended method for filling the small bone defects in those with appropriate soft tissue coverage is using bone substitutes or conventional cancellous autologous bone grafting [2-4]. For large bone defects exceeding 5 cm of diameter, the conventional methods are associated with high rate of failure and thus more advanced and specialized methods are required [5]. Large bone Â defects after traumatic Â fractures may lead Â to Â non-unionÂ  Â fractures Â which Â is Â devastating entity Â in Â orthopedicÂ  Â surgery. Â The Â prevalence Â of non-unionÂ  Â fractures is readily low being reported to be 2-6%, 2-8% and Â 3-6.4% in humerus, femur and tibia respectively [6,7]. Although they have low prevalence rate, however they are of matter of interest and research because of tremendousÂ  Â social and economical burden. It was reported that mean expense for treatment of non-union of humerus, femur and tibia is 31132, 34400 and 32660 USD respectively [8]. The risk factors of non-union fractures are primary injury, surrounding soft tissue injuries, inappropriate primary reduction technique, inappropriateÂ surgical technique, infection and osteomyelitis, concomitant vascular injuries, nicotine abuse, old age and presence of co-morbidities (peripheral vascular disease, cardiovascular disease, collagen-vascular disease, etc.) [6]. Thus prevention of non-unions Â via appropriate aligning the fracture site using internal or external fixators is the main strategy for management of this entity [9,10]. DebridementÂ of necrotic tissue along with intramedullary nailing has also been successfully used for preventions and treatment of non-union of the femoral bone [11]. Several other strategies have also been introduced and usedÂ withÂ controversial results. Among these are electromagnetic fields [12], biodegradable implants [13], recombinant bone morphogenetic protein 7 (rhBMP-7) [14] and Platelet rich plasma (PRP) [15]. 
 
PRP is an autologous blood product with high activated platelet concentrations (approximately 1 million per each micro-liters) containing considerable amountsÂ  of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and transforming Â growth factor (TGF-Î²1, TGF-Î²2) which are responsible for repair and granulation tissue formation in human body [15]. PRP has been successfully usedÂ  in Â treatment Â of Â musculoskeletal injuries [16]. Several studies have investigated the role of local PRP application in treatment of non-union fractures with conflicting results [17-24]. Although some studies have shown that this therapy increases the healing rate of the non-union fractures in animal models [17-20] and humanÂ subjects [21,22], some others found that PRP poses no advantage over placebo or rhBMP-7 [23,24]. A recent meta-analysis indicated that there is lack of standard randomized clinical trials to shed light on effectiveness of PRP application on healing rateÂ of non-union of long bones [25]. 
 
This application has been the subject of interest in several animal studies. Hakimi and co-workers [12] demonstrated thatÂ PRP combined with autologous cancellous bone leads to a significantly better bone regeneration compared to isolated application of autologous cancellous bone in an in vivo critical size defect on load-bearing long bones of mini-pigs during a time period of 6 weeks. Gerard and colleagues [18] also studied the effects of PRP onÂ healing rate of maxillary non-unions in animal model of dog. They demonstrated that PRP enhances the early healing rate of autologous bone grafts in maxillary bone. However the PRP healing rate enhancement was notÂ found significant after 2 months. This could be explained due to the fact that PRP enhances the removal of non- viable grafted autologous bones, but does not affect the regeneration and formation of new bone. Thus PRP has been concluded to affect the early healing rate. They also demonstrate that PRP administration does not increase the trabecular density in the bone graftsÂ  [18]. Â Kanthan and co-workers [19] found that application of PRP in combinationÂ with bone rafting improved the bone healing rate of rabbit tibial fractures when compared to bone graft alone. They also demonstrated that use of PRP alone (without bone grafting) does not affect the outcome and healing rate and provides limited advantage over placebo [19]. The result of these experimental studies was further supported by a clinical study that reported the results of successful treatment of 17 patients with persistent non-unionÂ  Â of long bones using combinationÂ Â  of PRPÂ and autologous bone grafting [12]. Â Galasso and colleagues [21] also used a combination of self locking intramedullary nailing and PRP for treatment of atrophic diaphyseal long bone non-unions.Â  They reported a healing rate of 91% which is comparable with previous reports. In contrast these studies, Aghaloo and co-workers [26] did notÂ observe any additive effects of PRP and autologous bone grafting for treatment of bone defects of rabbit animal model. This could be explained due to the methodology of this single experimental study. The platelet concentration used in this study was 7.3 times higher than the native blood which is higher compared to other studies and ours [17-24]. It is postulated that therapeutic effects of PRP occurs in a narrow platelet concentration,Â  probably 3-5 times higher than Â the native blood. Higher concentrations leads to platelet aggregation and the effects are limited; in the same way, low concentrations do not provide appropriate amounts of platelet derived growth factors needed for enhancing the healing environment [27]. 
 
Taking all these together it should be indicated that there is lack of appropriate clinical trials and evidence for using the PRP in treatment of non-union fractures.Â  But the results of several experimental studies indicate that PRP increases the early healing rate and alleviates the final outcome especially when used in combination with autologous bone graft. Currently several clinical trials are being performed addressing this issue (based on a search in Clinical Trial Registries). Thus the future of this method of treating non-unionÂ  Â fracturesÂ  is shinny Â and Â might change the current management.",2013,Bulletin of emergency and trauma
