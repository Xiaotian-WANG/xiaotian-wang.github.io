Hierarchical Total Variations and Doubly Penalized ANOVA Modeling for Multivariate Nonparametric Regression,"For multivariate nonparametric regression, functional analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) modeling aims to capture the relationship between a response and covariates by decomposing the unknown function into various components, representing main effects, two-way interactions, etc. Such an approach has been pursued explicitly in smoothing spline ANOVA modeling and implicitly in various greedy methods such as MARS. We develop a new method for functional ANOVA modeling, based on doubly penalized estimation using total-variation and empirical-norm penalties, to achieve sparse selection of component functions and their knots. For this purpose, we formulate a new class of hierarchical total variations, which measures total variations at different levels including main effects and multi-way interactions, possibly after some order of differentiation. Furthermore, we derive suitable basis functions for multivariate splines such that the hierarchical total variation can be represented as a regular Lasso penalty, and hence we extend a previous backfitting algorithm to handle doubly penalized estimation for ANOVA modeling. We present extensive numerical experiments on simulations and real data to compare our method with existing methods including MARS, tree boosting, and random forest. The results are very encouraging and demonstrate considerable gains from our method in both prediction or classification accuracy and simplicity of the fitted functions.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Accelerated proximal gradient method for elastoplastic analysis with von Mises yield criterion,"It is known that, under certain conditions, the quasi-static incremental analysis problem of elastoplastic structures with the von Mises yield criterion can be formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem, which can be solved with a primal-dual interior-point method. Alternatively, this paper proposes to solve an equivalent unconstrained nonsmooth convex optimization problem, which has a form similar to a class of regularized least-square problems, known as group LASSO. We propose an accelerated proximal gradient method with an adaptive restart scheme for solving this unconstrained optimization problem. The algorithm is easy to implement, and free from numerical solution of linear equations unlike conventional methods in computational mechanics. Numerical experiments suggest that the presented algorithm outperforms a standard solver that implements a primal-dual interior-point method for conic optimization.",2018,Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics
Learning Some Popular Gaussian Graphical Models without Condition Number Bounds,"Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) have wide-ranging applications in machine learning and the natural and social sciences. In most of the settings in which they are applied, the number of observed samples is much smaller than the dimension and they are assumed to be sparse. While there are a variety of algorithms (e.g. Graphical Lasso, CLIME) that provably recover the graph structure with a logarithmic number of samples, they assume various conditions that require the precision matrix to be in some sense well-conditioned. 
Here we give the first polynomial-time algorithms for learning attractive GGMs and walk-summable GGMs with a logarithmic number of samples without any such assumptions. In particular, our algorithms can tolerate strong dependencies among the variables. Our result for structure recovery in walk-summable GGMs is derived from a more general result for efficient sparse linear regression in walk-summable models without any norm dependencies. We complement our results with experiments showing that many existing algorithms fail even in some simple settings where there are long dependency chains, whereas ours do not.",2019,ArXiv
"Sugars, Cyclitols and Seagrass Phylogeny","Abstract Seagrasses of the Zannichelliaceae accumulate larger amounts and a greater range of cyclitols than do other seagrasses. Amphibolis, Cymodocea, Syringodium and Thalassodendron contained up to 10% dry weight of compounds identified as 1- chiro -inositol, muco -inositol and a methyl-O- muco -inositol, in addition to traces of myo -inositol. These compounds were not utilised as carbohydrate reserves and there is some evidence that they accumulated as by-products of an unusual glucose cyclisation mechanism. Sucrose can accumulate to more than 50% of dry weight in underground rhizomes and roots of these and other seagrasses and it was also the major initial product of photosynthesis in most seagrasses leaves. A distinct phylogenetic trend, based on their cyclitols, can be distinguished within the seagrass. This is discussed in terms of seagrass origins and biogeography.",1983,Aquatic Botany
Results of thumb correction in leprosy using different techniques.,"Forty-four hands of 42 leprosy patients with paralysis of intrinsic muscles of the hand were treated by opponensplasty using ring finger superficialis (FDS4) or extensor indicis proprius (EIP). Superficialis tendon of middle finger was also used in these hands for lumbrical replacement by ""direct lasso"" operation. Low ulnar paralysis with Froment's sign was corrected by transfer of radial half of flexor pollicis longus (FPL) to extensor pollicis longus (EPL). Results of thumb correction were assessed and analysed in 37 hands of 35 patients. The mean follow-up period was 19 months. Best results were found with transfer of half FPL to EPL. Results of FDS transfer was good in 12 out of 16 manual workers. EIP transfer worked well, but the power of the thumb and patients' satisfaction was less.",1999,Indian journal of leprosy
FamLBL: detecting rare haplotype disease association based on common SNPs using case-parent triads,"MOTIVATION
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) amassed in genome-wide association studies to investigate rare haplotype effects on complex diseases. Evidence has suggested that rare haplotypes may tag rare causal single-nucleotide variants, making SNP-based rare haplotype analysis not only cost effective, but also more valuable for detecting causal variants. Although a number of methods for detecting rare haplotype association have been proposed in recent years, they are population based and thus susceptible to population stratification.


RESULTS
We propose family-triad-based logistic Bayesian Lasso (famLBL) for estimating effects of haplotypes on complex diseases using SNP data. By choosing appropriate prior distribution, effect sizes of unassociated haplotypes can be shrunk toward zero, allowing for more precise estimation of associated haplotypes, especially those that are rare, thereby achieving greater detection power. We evaluate famLBL using simulation to gauge its type I error and power. Compared with its population counterpart, LBL, highlights famLBL's robustness property in the presence of population substructure. Further investigation by comparing famLBL with Family-Based Association Test (FBAT) reveals its advantage for detecting rare haplotype association.


AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION

Accelerating Bayesian synthetic likelihood with the graphical lasso,"Simulation-based Bayesian inference methods are useful when the statistical model of interest does not possess a computationally tractable likelihood function. One such likelihood-free method is approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), which approximates the likelihood of a carefully chosen summary statistic via model simulation and non-parametric density estimation. ABC is known to suer a curse of dimensionality with the size of the summary statistic. When the model summary statistic is roughly normally distributed in regions of the parameter space of interest, Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL), which uses a normal likelihood approximation for a summary statistic, is a useful method that can be more computationally efficient than ABC. However, BSL requires estimation of the covariance matrix of the summary statistic for each proposed parameter, which requires a large number of simulations to estimate precisely using the sample covariance matrix when the summary statistic is high dimensional. In this paper we propose to use the graphical lasso to provide a sparse estimate of the precision matrix. This approach can estimate the covariance matrix accurately with significantly fewer model simulations. We discuss the non-trivial issue of tuning parameter choice in the context of BSL and demonstrate on several complex applications that our method, which we call BSLasso, provides significant improvements in computational efficiency whilst maintaining the ability to produce similar posterior distributions to BSL. The BSL and BSLasso methods applied to the examples of this paper are implemented in the BSL package in R, which is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).",2018,Science & Engineering Faculty

A multi-label classification approach for Facial Expression Recognition,"Facial Expression Recognition (FER) techniques have already been adopted in numerous multimedia systems. Plenty of previous research assumes that each facial picture should be linked to only one of the predefined affective labels. Nevertheless, in practical applications, few of the expressions are exactly one of the predefined affective states. Therefore, to depict the facial expressions more accurately, this paper proposes a multi-label classification approach for FER and each facial expression would be labeled with one or multiple affective states. Meanwhile, by modeling the relationship between labels via Group Lasso regularization term, a maximum margin multi-label classifier is presented and the convex optimization formulation guarantees a global optimal solution. To evaluate the performance of our classifier, the JAFFE dataset is extended into a multi-label facial expression dataset by setting threshold to its continuous labels marked in the original dataset and the labeling results have shown that multiple labels can output a far more accurate description of facial expression. At the same time, the classification results have verified the superior performance of our algorithm.",2013,2013 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)
"Juvenile Thalassoma amblycephalum Bleeker (Labridae, Teleostei) dwelling among the tentacles of sea anemones: A cleanerfish with an unusual client?","At least 51 species of fishes are facultative symbionts of sea anemones. Most of the behavioural, ecological and physiological aspects of these associations including their costs and benefits are unknown. We recorded the behaviour and the habitat use of eight assemblages (three or ten specimens each) of the juvenile wrasse Thalassoma amblycephalum dwelling among the tentacles of the two sea anemones Entacmaea quadricolor (clonal type), and Heteractis magnifica at a coral reef in southern Japan during 16 months in daylight hours. There are only two past records of this facultative association, one from east Africa and one from Indonesia. The wrasse remained close to and was occasionally in physical contact with the host when foraging amongst the tentacles. When frightened, they took shelter among corals, away from the host anemone. The wrasse co-existed with the anemonefishes Amphiprion frenatus in E. quadricolor and A. ocellaris in H. magnifica. By using forced host contact tests ex situ and scanning electron microscopy examination of the fish epidermis, we show that juveniles of this wrasse are protected from E. quadricolor, but possibly not from H. magnifica. We suggest that juvenile T. amblycephalum dwelling among the tentacles of sea anemones are cleanerfish with an unusual client, in that they appear to clean mucus and, or, necrotic tissue from the sea anemone host.",2006,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology
"Pyronaridineâ€“artesunate or dihydroartemisininâ€“piperaquine versus current first-line therapies for repeated treatment of uncomplicated malaria: a randomised, multicentre, open-label, longitudinal, controlled, phase 3b/4 trial","BACKGROUND
Artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine are used as first-line artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in west Africa. Pyronaridine-artesunate and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine are potentially useful for diversification of ACTs in this region, but further safety and efficacy data are required on malaria retreatment.


METHODS
We did a randomised, multicentre, open-label, longitudinal, controlled phase 3b/4 clinical trial at seven tertiary centres in Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Mali. Eligible participants for first malaria episode and all retreatment episodes were adults and children aged 6 months and older with microscopically confirmed Plasmodium spp malaria (>0 to <200â€ˆ000 parasites per Î¼L of blood) and fever or history of fever in the previous 24 h. Individuals with severe or complicated malaria, an alanine aminotransferase concentration of more than twice the upper limit of normal, or a QTc greater than 450 ms were excluded. Using a randomisation list for each site, masked using sealed envelopes, participants were assigned to either pyronaridine-artesunate or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus either artesunate-amodiaquine or artemether-lumefantrine. Block sizes were two or four if two treatments were allocated, and three or six if three treatments were allocated. Microscopists doing the parasitological assessments were masked to treatment allocation. All treatments were once-daily or twice-daily tablets or granules given orally and dosed by bodyweight over 3 days at the study centre. Patients were followed up as outpatients up to day 42, receiving clinical assessments on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Two primary outcomes were compared for non-inferiority: the 2-year incidence rate of all microscopically confirmed, complicated and uncomplicated malaria episodes in patients in the intention-to-treat population (ITT; non-inferiority margin 20%); and adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) in uncomplicated malaria across all episodes (unadjusted and PCR-adjusted for Plasmodium falciparum and unadjusted for other Plasmodium spp) in the per-protocol population on days 28 and 42 (non-inferiority margin 5%). Safety was assessed in all participants who received one dose of study drug. This study is registered at the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR201105000286876).


FINDINGS
Between Oct 24, 2011, and Feb 1, 2016, we assigned 4710 eligible participants to the different treatment strategies: 1342 to pyronaridine-artesunate, 967 to artemether-lumefantrine, 1061 to artesunate-amodiaquine, and 1340 to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The 2-year malaria incidence rate in the ITT population was non-inferior for pyronaridine-artesunate versus artemether-lumefantrine (1Â·77, 95% CI 1Â·63-1Â·93 vs 1Â·87, 1Â·72-2Â·03; rate ratio [RR] 1Â·05, 95% CI 0Â·94-1Â·17); and versus artesunate-amodiaquine (1Â·39, 95% CI 1Â·22-1Â·59 vs 1Â·35, 1Â·18-1Â·54; RR 0Â·97, 0Â·87-1Â·07). Similarly, this endpoint was non-inferior for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus artemether-lumefantrine (1Â·16, 95% CI 1Â·01-1Â·34 vs 1Â·42 1Â·25-1Â·62; RR 1Â·22, 95% CI 1Â·06-1Â·41) and versus artesunate-amodiaquine (1Â·35, 1Â·21-1Â·51 vs 1Â·68, 1Â·51-1Â·88; RR 1Â·25, 1Â·02-1Â·50). For uncomplicated P falciparum malaria, PCR-adjusted ACPR was greater than 99Â·5% at day 28 and greater than 98Â·6% at day 42 for all ACTs; unadjusted ACPR was higher for pyronaridine-artesunate versus comparators at day 28 (96Â·9% vs 82Â·3% for artemether-lumefantrine and 95Â·6% vs 89Â·0% for artesunate-amodiaquine) and for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus comparators (99Â·5% vs 81Â·6% for artemether-lumefantrine and 99Â·0% vs 89Â·0% for artesunate-amodiaquine). For non-falciparum species, unadjusted ACPR was greater than 98% for all study drugs at day 28 and at day 42 was greater than 83% except for artemether-lumefantrine against Plasmodium ovale (in ten [62Â·5%] of 16 patients) and against Plasmodium malariae (in nine [75Â·0%] of 12 patients). Nine deaths occurred during the study, none of which were related to the study treatment. Mostly mild transient elevations in transaminases occurred with pyronaridine-artesunate versus comparators, and mild QTcF prolongation with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus comparators.


INTERPRETATION
Pyronaridine-artesunate and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment and retreatment of malaria were well tolerated with efficacy that was non-inferior to first-line ACTs. Greater access to these efficacious treatments in west Africa is justified.

Adaptive piecewise polynomial estimation via trend filtering,"We study trend filtering, a recently proposed tool of Kim et al. [SIAM Rev. 51 (2009) 339-360] for nonparametric regression. The trend filtering estimate is defined as the minimizer of a penalized least squares criterion, in which the penalty term sums the absolute $k$th order discrete derivatives over the input points. Perhaps not surprisingly, trend filtering estimates appear to have the structure of $k$th degree spline functions, with adaptively chosen knot points (we say ``appear'' here as trend filtering estimates are not really functions over continuous domains, and are only defined over the discrete set of inputs). This brings to mind comparisons to other nonparametric regression tools that also produce adaptive splines; in particular, we compare trend filtering to smoothing splines, which penalize the sum of squared derivatives across input points, and to locally adaptive regression splines [Ann. Statist. 25 (1997) 387-413], which penalize the total variation of the $k$th derivative. Empirically, we discover that trend filtering estimates adapt to the local level of smoothness much better than smoothing splines, and further, they exhibit a remarkable similarity to locally adaptive regression splines. We also provide theoretical support for these empirical findings; most notably, we prove that (with the right choice of tuning parameter) the trend filtering estimate converges to the true underlying function at the minimax rate for functions whose $k$th derivative is of bounded variation. This is done via an asymptotic pairing of trend filtering and locally adaptive regression splines, which have already been shown to converge at the minimax rate [Ann. Statist. 25 (1997) 387-413]. At the core of this argument is a new result tying together the fitted values of two lasso problems that share the same outcome vector, but have different predictor matrices.",2014,Annals of Statistics
Bayesian and LASSO Regressions for Comparative Permeability Modeling of Sandstone Reservoirs,"In this research, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) algorithms were adopted for the core permeability modeling as a function of well log and core measurements. More specifically, the core permeability (dependent factor) was modeled given the well log and core data (independent variables) and then predicted in non-cored intervals of a well in a sandstone formation. The BMA is a stochastic linear modeling and a Bayesian parameter selection. Among 50 linear models generated as a function of the independent variables and depicted in Occamâ€™s window, the best model of the highest posterior probability is determined. The best model has the optimal subset parameters that most influences the response factor. The core permeability modeling was again conducted using the LASSO algorithm, which adopts a completely different way of modeling and subset selection by using the penalized least-squared equation. Both BMA and LASSO resulted in a very accurate prediction of the core permeability by achieving perfect measured and calculated permeability matching. Matches for the two algorithms were quantified by computing the adjusted R-squared and root-mean-squared prediction error. In addition, results of the BMA and LASSO were compared to the conventional multiple linear regression (LM). The LASSO algorithm led to an accurate matching similar to LM, but slightly better than BMA. Therefore, both BMA and LASSO represent integrated procedures for accurate permeability estimation similar to conventional regression analysis.",2018,Natural Resources Research
Breeding strategies of Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica and Southern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides in the high Antarctic and implications for reproductive success,"Breeding strategies of two closely related fulmarine petrels were studied on Ardery Island, on the continental coast of East Antarctica, where short summers are expected to narrow the time-window for reproduction. Both species had a similar breeding period (97 days from laying to fledging) but Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica bred up to 16 days earlier than Southern Fulmars. During the pre-laying exodus, all Antarctic Petrels deserted the colony, whereas some Southern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides remained. Antarctic Petrels exhibited stronger synchronization in breeding, made longer foraging trips and spent less time guarding their chicks than Southern Fulmars. Overall breeding success of both species was similar but failures of Antarctic Petrels were concentrated in the early egg-phase and after hatching, when parents ceased guarding. Southern Fulmars lost eggs and chicks later in the breeding cycle and so wasted more parental investment in failed breeding attempts. Different breeding strategies may be imposed by flight characteristics; Southern Fulmars are less capable of crossing large expanses of pack ice and need to delay breeding until the sea ice retreats and breaks up. However, due to the short summer they risk chick failure when weather conditions deteriorate late in the season.",2007,Ibis
Thresholded Lasso for high dimensional variable selection and statistical estimation,"Given $n$ noisy samples with $p$ dimensions, where $n \ll p$, we show that the multi-step thresholding procedure based on the Lasso -- we call it the {\it Thresholded Lasso}, can accurately estimate a sparse vector $\beta \in \R^p$ in a linear model $Y = X \beta + \epsilon$, where $X_{n \times p}$ is a design matrix normalized to have column $\ell_2$ norm $\sqrt{n}$, and $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2 I_n)$. We show that under the restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition (Bickel-Ritov-Tsybakov 09), it is possible to achieve the $\ell_2$ loss within a logarithmic factor of the ideal mean square error one would achieve with an {\em oracle} while selecting a sufficiently sparse model -- hence achieving {\it sparse oracle inequalities}; the oracle would supply perfect information about which coordinates are non-zero and which are above the noise level. In some sense, the Thresholded Lasso recovers the choices that would have been made by the $\ell_0$ penalized least squares estimators, in that it selects a sufficiently sparse model without sacrificing the accuracy in estimating $\beta$ and in predicting $X \beta$. We also show for the Gauss-Dantzig selector (Cand\`{e}s-Tao 07), if $X$ obeys a uniform uncertainty principle and if the true parameter is sufficiently sparse, one will achieve the sparse oracle inequalities as above, while allowing at most $s_0$ irrelevant variables in the model in the worst case, where $s_0 \leq s$ is the smallest integer such that for $\lambda = \sqrt{2 \log p/n}$, $\sum_{i=1}^p \min(\beta_i^2, \lambda^2 \sigma^2) \leq s_0 \lambda^2 \sigma^2$. Our simulation results on the Thresholded Lasso match our theoretical analysis excellently.",2010,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Prediction of risk scores for colorectal cancer patients from the concentration of proteins involved in mitochondrial apoptotic pathway,"One of the major challenges in managing the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is to predict risk scores or level of risk for CRC patients. In past, several biomarkers, based on concentration of proteins involved in type-2/intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, have been identified for prognosis of colorectal cancer patients. Recently, a prognostic tool DR MOMP has been developed that can discriminate high and low risk CRC patients with reasonably high accuracy (Hazard Ratio, HR = 5.24 and p-value = 0.0031). This prognostic tool showed an accuracy of 59.7% when used to predict favorable/unfavorable survival outcomes. In this study, we developed knowledge based models for predicting risk scores of CRC patients. Models were trained and evaluated on 134 stage III CRC patients. Firstly, we developed multiple linear regression based models using different techniques and achieved a maximum HR value of 6.34 with p-value = 0.0032 for a model developed using LassoLars technique. Secondly, models were developed using a parameter optimization technique and achieved a maximum HR value of 38.13 with p-value 0.0006. We also predicted favorable/unfavorable survival outcomes and achieved maximum prediction accuracy value of 71.64%. The performance of our models were evaluated using five-fold cross-validation technique.

2007 Guideline for the management of ureteral calculi.,"TheAmericanUrologicalAssociationNephrolithiasis Clinical Guideline Panel was established in 1991. Since that time, the Panel has developed three guidelines on the management of nephrolithiasis, the most recent being a 2005 update of the original 1994 Report on the Management of Staghorn Calculi [1]. The European Association of Urology began their nephrolithiasis guideline project in 2000, yielding the publication of Guidelines on Urolithiasis, with updates in 2001 and 2006 [2]. While both documents provide useful recommendations on the management of ureteral calculi, changes in shock-wave lithotripsy technology, endoscope design, intracorporeal lithotripsy techniques, and laparoscopic expertise have burgeoned over the past five to ten years. Under the sage leadership of the late Dr. JosephW. Segura, the AUA Practice Guidelines Committee suggested to both the AUA and the EAU that they join efforts in developing the first set of internationally endorsed guidelines focusing on the changes introduced in ureteral stone management over the last decade. We therefore dedicate this report to the memory of Dr. Joseph W. Segura whose vision, integrity, and perseverance led to the establishment of the first international guideline project. This joint EAU/AUA Nephrolithiasis Guideline Panel (hereinafter the Panel) performed a systematic review of the English language literature published since 1997 and a comprehensively analyzed outcomes data from the identified studies. Based on their findings, the Panel concluded that when removal becomes necessary, SWL and ureteroscopy remain the two primary treatment modalities for the management of symptomatic ureteral calculi. Other treatments were reviewed, including medical expulsive therapy to facilitate spontaneous stone passage, percutaneous antegrade ureteroscopy, and laparoscopic and open surgical ureterolithotomy. In concurrence with the previously published guidelines of both organizations, open stone surgery is still considered a secondary treatment option. Blind basketing of ureteral calculi is not recommended.

"New data on Callovian (Middle Jurassic) belemnites and palynomorphs from the Northern Caucasus, southwest Russia","Abstract Palaeontological data on the Caucasus are highly important for large-scale stratigraphical and palaeobiogeographical assessment of the northern Tethyan margin, but this information is often scarce and not available in English. Field studies in the Northern Caucasus have now permitted to amass some new data. Two belemnite species are described from the stratotype section of the Kamennomostskaja Formation (Callovian, Middle Jurassic) near the town of Kamennomostskij in Adygeja (Northern Caucasus). These are Belemnopsis subhastata (von Zieten, 1831) and Rhopaloteuthis ominosa Gustomesov, 1968. The latter is a rare species, and the present find allows new insights into its taxonomy. A palyno-logical analysis of the belemnite-bearing sample was carried out, and a diverse assemblage of dinocysts, acritarchs and prasinophytes, plus pollen and spores recognised. The most abundant palynomorphs are Micrhystridium and Classopollis. Data on belemnites coupled with those on palynomorphs indicate the early Callovian age of the sample level. This interpretation differs slightly from previous conclusions based on ammonites and dinocysts. If this age is correct, the degree of condensation of Callovian deposits in the section studied was lesser than previously assumed.",2016,Geologos
Discriminative sparse representation for face recognition,"Recently Sparse Representation (or coding) based Classification (SRC) has gained great success in face recognition. In SRC, the testing image is expected to be best represented as a sparse linear combination of training images from the same class, and the representation fidelity is measured by the â„“2-norm or â„“1-norm of the coding residual. However, SRC emphasizes the sparsity too much and overlooks the spatial information during local feature encoding process which has been demonstrated to be critical in real-world face recognition problems. Besides, some work considers the spatial information but overlooks the different discriminative ability in different face regions. In this paper, we propose to weight spatial locations based on their discriminative abilities in sparse coding for robust face recognition. Specifically, we learn the weights at face locations according to the information entropy in each face region, so as to highlight locations in face images that are important for classification. Furthermore, in order to construct a robust weights to fully exploit structure information of each face region, we employed external data to learn the weights, which can cover all possible face image variants of different persons, so the robustness of obtained weights can be guaranteed. Finally, we consider the group structure of training images (i.e. those from the same subject) and added an â„“2,1-norm (group Lasso) constraint upon the formulation, which enforcing the sparsity at the group level. Extensive experiments on three benchmark face datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is much more robust and effective than baseline methods in dealing with face occlusion, corruption, lighting and expression changes, etc.",2015,Multimedia Tools and Applications

Generalizing the idea of the Lasso, we consider the problem of estimating the coefficients by minimizing the sum of squares with the constraint that the coefficients belong to a closed convex set. Based on a differential geometric approach, we derive an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom for this estimation method, under a smoothness assumption on the boundary of the closed convex set. The result presented in this paper is applicable to estimation with a wide class of constraints. As an application, we obtain a C""p type criterion and AIC for selecting tuning parameters.",2009,J.

Si mettono inoltre in risalto due aspetti singolari del problema: uno riguardante il cosidetto fenomeno dell'emigrazione delle cerniere plastiche in dipendenza del ritorno elastico della materia, l'altro riguardante il successivo propagarsi della plasticizzazione nel suolo che, connesso al movimento delle cerniere nella trave, fa individuare lo schema di collasso del sistema.SummaryThe behavior of the beam-soil system is examined within the scope of the bilateral schematization of ideal elastoplastic bodies, in the following work stages; the expression for the limit load is supplied for each stage:-elastic beam in an elastoplastic medium-elastoplastic beam in an elastic medium-beam and soil in an elastoplastic condition.
Two peculiar features of the problem are highlighted:1) the â€œplastic hinge migrationâ€ phenomenon, due to the elastic unloading of the material, and2) the successive propagation of plastification in the soil which, being related to the displacement of the hinges in the beam, leads to the identification of the collapse mechanism of the systme.",1968,Meccanica
The Inheritance of the Naval Officer,"IT seems good sense to say that a man who dislikes the sea and all that therein is, who has no spirit of adventure, who is, in short, a low-spirited land-lubber, is not in the least likely to make a distinguished naval officer. You never can tell, of course, for Nelson was always seasick and often pessimistic, but the chances are against a man such as we have pictured becoming a bright and shining light in the Navy. And that is what Dr. Davenport and his assistant have said, only they have said it very learnedly with a lot of technicalities about â€œthalassophilia,â€ â€œhyperkinetism,â€ â€œnomadism,â€ and â€œreces-sives.â€ The study of heredity does not foster a sense of humour, and we cannot wonder.

"Using machine learning to estimate atmospheric pollen concentrations in Tulsa, OK","This article describes an example of using machine learning to estimate the abundance of airborne Ambrosia pollen for Tulsa, OK. Twenty-seven years of historical pollen observations were used. These pollen observations were combined with machine learning and a very complete meteorological and land surface context of 85 variables to estimate the daily Ambrosia abundance. The machine learning algorithms employed were Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), neural networks, and random forests. The best performance was obtained using random forests. The physical insights provided by the random forest are also discussed.",2017,Environmental health insights
Haptic Feedback in Room-Scale VR,"Virtual reality (VR) is now becoming a mainstream medium. Current systems like the HTC Vive offer accurate tracking of the HMD and controllers, which allows for highly immersive interactions with the virtual environment. The interactions can be further enhanced by adding feedback. As an example, a controller can vibrate when it is close to a grabbable ball. As such interactions are not exhaustingly researched, we conducted a user study. Specifically, we examine: 1. grabbing and throwing with controllers in a simple basketball game. 2. the influence of haptic and optical feedback on performance, presence, task load, and usability. 3. the advantages of VR over desktop for point-cloud editing. Several new techniques emerged from the point-cloud editor for VR. The bi-manual pinch gesture, which extends the handlebar metaphor, is a novel viewing method used to translate, rotate, and scale the point-cloud. Our new rendering technique uses the geometry shader to draw sparse point clouds quickly. The selection volumes at the controllers are our new technique to efficiently select points in point clouds. The resulting selection is visualized in real time. The results of the user study show that: 1. grabbing with a controller button is intuitive but throwing is not. Releasing a button is a bad metaphor for releasing a grabbed virtual object in order to throw it. 2. any feedback is better than none. Adding haptic, optical, or both feedback types to the grabbing improves the user performance and presence. However, only sub-scores like accuracy and predictability are significantly improved. Usability and task load are mostly unaffected by feedback. 3. the point-cloud editing is significantly better in VR with the bi-manual pinch gesture and selection volumes than on the desktop with the orbiting camera and lasso selections.",2017,
Resource translocation within seagrass clones: allometric scaling to plant size and productivity,"The allometric scaling of resource demand and translocation within seagrass clones to plant size (i.e. shoot mass and rhizome diameter), shoot production and leaf turnover was examined in situ in eight seagrass species (Cymodocea nodosa, Cymodocea serrulata, Halophila stipulacea, Halodule uninervis, Posidonia oceanica, Thalassodendron ciliatum, Thalassia hemprichii and Zostera noltii), encompassing most of the size range present in seagrass flora. One fully developed shoot on each experimental rhizome was incubated for 2â€“3Â h with a pulse of NaH13CO3 (235Â Î¼mol) and 15NH4Cl (40Â Î¼mol). The mobilisation of incorporated tracers across the clone was examined 4Â days later. Carbon and nitrogen demand for shoot production across seagrass species scaled at half of the shoot mass, whereas seagrass leaves incorporated tracers (13C and 15N) at rates proportional to the shoot mass. The shoots of all seagrass species shared resources with neighbours, particularly with younger ones. The time scales of physiological integration and the absolute amount of resources shared by seagrass ramets scaled at 2.5 power of the rhizome diameter. Hence, the ramets of larger species were physiologically connected for longer time scales and share larger absolute amounts of resources with neighbours than those of smaller species. The different pattern of resource translocation exhibited by seagrasses helps explain the ecological role displayed by these species and the success of large seagrasses colonising nutrient-poor coastal areas, where they often dominate.",2006,Oecologia
"Multi-â€˜omicâ€™ analyses of the dynamics, mechanisms, and pathways for carbon turnover in grassland soil under two climate regimes","In this project, we will investigate how different rainfall impacts the dynamics of carbon stored in grassland soil, and the potential consequences for release of carbon and other nutrients from soils to streams. However, little is known of the microorganisms that play vital roles in the processing of this largely vegetation-derived soil carbon and how the metabolic activities that occur at different soil depths ultimately impact DOC discharged into streams. We are studying the period around the first Fall rainfall event, when soilassociated carbon fixed during Spring growth is rapidly metabolized, focusing on climate manipulations that differ 1) in the amount of Spring rainfall (above-ground carbon stocks) and 2) on the period of time following the first Fall rain events (soil microbial communities) and 3) soil depth. Genomic information was obtained for ten soil samples from two sites at 1020 cm and 3040 cm depth, two of which were collected before the first rainfall and the rest after. Metagenomic data were assembled and draft genomes, including dozens of partial to near complete genomes, were binned and reconstructed based on time series coverage analysis and tetranucleotide frequency using ggKbase and emergent self-organizing maps. While present in most samples, many microbes were more abundant (estimated by coverage) at certain depths. Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were more abundant in the 1020 cm sample than 3040 cm while the Archaea domain, Methylomirabilis, GAL15, and NC10 were more abundant at 3040 cm than the 1020 cm depth. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the soil is dominated by Archaea and several phyla of Bacteria. Most of the organisms clustered with closely related species, creating a dandelion-like structure at the branchesâ€™ termini. In many cases there were no reference sequences of considerable similarity, representing new phyla and many novel classes and orders within the Gemmatimonadetes, Verrucomicrobia, Deltaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria (most novelty here), and Chloroflexi phyla. Polar metabolites were extracted from selected preand post-rain soil samples using an aqueous extraction method and detected on an Agilent 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF LC/MS system following separation on a zwitterionic stationary phase column. Approximately 140 putative compounds were tracked across soil depth profiles and preliminary analysis of the metabolite composition indicated that carbon and nitrogen sources (simple sugars and quaternary ammonium compounds) clustered with depth, decreasing from 10 cm to 40 cm. Total protein samples were extracted from soils using a modified MoBio NoviPure protocol and cleaned up and digested using the Filter-Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) method. The proteome digest samples were analyzed using 2-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry on a LTQOrbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. The mass spectral data were searched using the Sipros algorithm on the Titan supercomputer against a combined soil metagenome database constructed above. On average approximately two thousand proteins or protein groups were identified per soil sample with a peptide-level false discovery rate at 1% and a protein-level false discovery rate at ~2%. Proteomics analysis revealed that corresponding sugar transporters are present and that there are abundant proteins in all samples are those involved in methanotrophy and ammonification. The results from these â€œomicsâ€ methods are quickly coming together to form a narrative about the dynamic microbial community and its processes below the grass root zone with respect to carbon flow during the Fall rainfall event. We anticipate these below ground terrestrial system feedbacks will impact the grassland ecosystem and the global carbon cycle.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for adults with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma: can we successfully step into the era of precision medicine?,"Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is a relatively rare but highly aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), most of which have T-cell origin (T-LBL) [1]. Due to the rarity of T-LBL, no well-designed prospective clinical trials have been conducted to establish the optimal treatment regimens. It is generally recognized that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-like intensive chemotherapies can acheive more favorable prognosis in T-LBL than NHL-like regimens [1â€“3]. Though the prognosis of pediatric T-LBL has been improved significantly, unmet clinical needs exist in the treatment of adult T-LBL [2]. Although ALL-like intensive induction chemotherapies could induce high remission rate, the relapse rate remains high (40â€“50%). Currently, intensive consolidation chemotherapies followed by maintenance treatment or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are used to reduce the relapse rate although the role of HSCT consolidation has not been defined [1]. In addition, no reliable prognostic factors have been defined in adult T-LBL as in T-ALL [4]. Commonly used risk factors, such as bone marrow and central nervous system involvement, advanced stage, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level showed prognostic value [5] which is yet to be validated in the era of ALL-like treatment. Recently the GRAALL-LYSA LL03 study has proposed a four-gene oncogenetic classifier (NOTCH1/ FBXW7/RAS/PTEN) [6]. Cortelazzo et al. suggested that minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow, based on analysis of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement in a small number (n = 11) of patients, was a useful index to assign adult patients with T-LBL to HSCT [7]. MRD monitoring may be combined with PET-CT scan for selection of HSCT and maintenance therapy. However, several studies found that PET-CT findings did not predict clinical outcome in T-LBL [6, 8], and the incidence of false-positive PET-CT scan for mediastinum lesions can be high [9]. Thus, it is critical to develop a reliable prognostic model to both predict outcomes of ALL-like treatment and facilitate precision medicine for choice of HSCT in T-LBL. In a study recently published in Leukemia [10], titled â€œPrognostic and predictive value of a microRNA signature in adults with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomaâ€, Tian et al. developed a five-miRNA-based classifier in a largest-ever cohort of T-LBL, and validated it to be a valuable biomarker to identify patients who could benefit from HSCT in first complete remission (CR1). In this multicenter study, 517 patients with T-LBL treated with ALL-like regimens were included, and all patients achieved CR1 after relatively uniform treatments (365 patients were treated according to BFM protocol and 152 patients according to hyperCVAD protocol). Using microarray, 35 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between 75 T-LBL tissue samples and 20 fetal thymus tissues, which were further analyzed for 213 T-LBL patients using qRT-PCR. A five-miRNA-based classifier, a risk estimator based on expression status of five miRNAs (including miR-21-5p, miR-513a-5p, miR-19b3p, miR-26a-5p, and miR-638) and their LASSO Cox regression coefficents in the training set, was constructed and validated to be an independent prognostic factor at diagnosis for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in 213 T-LBL and the entire cohort (DFS: hazard ratio [HR] 3.427, 95% CI 2.586â€“4.540, p < 0.001; OS: HR 3.142, 95% CI 2.332â€“4.234, p < 0.001). HSCT was given to 145 patients at CR1 at the discretion of their treating physicians. No benefit of HSCT consolidation was shown in the entire cohort. Moreover, HSCT did not show benefit in high-risk patients according to clinical or genetic * Ken H. Young ken.young@duke.edu",2019,Leukemia
A nested case-control study of 277 prediagnostic serum cytokines and glioma,"Recent research shows bidirectional communication between the normal brain and the peripheral immune system. Glioma is a primary brain tumor characterized by systemic immunosuppression. To better understand gliomagenesis, we evaluated associations between 277 prediagnostic serum cytokines and glioma. We used glioma (n = 487) and matched control (n = 487) specimens from the Janus Serum Bank Cohort in Oslo, Norway. Conditional logistic regression allowed us to identify those cytokines that were individually associated with glioma. Next, we used heat maps to compare case to control Pearson correlation matrices of 12 cytokines modeled in an in silico study of the interaction between the microenvironment and the tumor. We did the same for case-control correlation matrices of lasso-selected cytokines and all 277 cytokines in the data set. Cytokines related to glioma risk (P â‰¤ .05) more than 10 years before diagnosis are sIL10RB, VEGF, beta-Catenin and CCL22. LIF was associated with decreased glioma risk within five years before glioma diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23, 0.94). After adjustment for cytokines above, the previously observed interaction between IL4 and sIL4RA persisted (> 20 years before diagnosis, OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.20, 2.47). In addition, during this period, case correlations among 12 cytokines were weaker than were those among controls. This pattern was also observed among 30 lasso- selected cytokines and all 277 cytokines. We identified four cytokines and one interaction term that were independently related to glioma risk. We have documented prediagnostic changes in serum cytokine levels that may reflect the presence of a preclinical tumor.",2017,PLoS ONE
Stable Recovery with Analysis Decomposable Priors,"In this paper, we investigate in a unified way the structural properties of solutions to inverse problems. These solutions are regularized by the generic class of semi-norms defined as a decomposable norm composed with a linear operator, the so-called analysis type decomposable prior. This encompasses several well-known analysis-type regularizations such as the discrete total variation (in any dimension), analysis group-Lasso or the nuclear norm. Our main results establish sufficient conditions under which uniqueness and stability to a bounded noise of the regularized solution are guaranteed. Along the way, we also provide a strong sufficient uniqueness result that is of independent interest and goes beyond the case of decomposable norms.",2013,ArXiv
Neurocognitive Graphs of First-Episode Schizophrenia and Major Depression Based on Cognitive Features,"Neurocognitive deficits are frequently observed in patients with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD). The relations between cognitive features may be represented by neurocognitive graphs based on cognitive features, modeled as Gaussian Markov random fields. However, it is unclear whether it is possible to differentiate between phenotypic patterns associated with the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia and depression using this neurocognitive graph approach. In this study, we enrolled 215 first-episode patients with schizophrenia (FES), 125 with MDD, and 237 demographically-matched healthy controls (HCs). The cognitive performance of all participants was evaluated using a battery of neurocognitive tests. The graphical LASSO model was trained with a one-vs-one scenario to learn the conditional independent structure of neurocognitive features of each group. Participants in the holdout dataset were classified into different groups with the highest likelihood. A partial correlation matrix was transformed from the graphical model to further explore the neurocognitive graph for each group. The classification approach identified the diagnostic class for individuals with an average accuracy of 73.41% for FES vs HC, 67.07% for MDD vs HC, and 59.48% for FES vs MDD. Both of the neurocognitive graphs for FES and MDD had more connections and higher node centrality than those for HC. The neurocognitive graph for FES was less sparse and had more connections than that for MDD. Thus, neurocognitive graphs based on cognitive features are promising for describing endophenotypes that may discriminate schizophrenia from depression.",2017,Neuroscience Bulletin
The Personal Networks of Entrepreneurs in an Informal African Urban Economy: Does the â€˜Strength of Tiesâ€™ Matter?,"This paper investigates Granovetter's â€œstrength of weak tiesâ€ hypothesis in an informal African urban economy. It outlines an approach articulated around the reticular embeddedness conceptual framework associated with the notion of â€œego-centred network.â€ The content of ties in an entrepreneur's network is described by three salient dimensions: strength, social role and exchanged resources. We use an original dataset collected in the informal economy of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) to evaluate how the content and strength of ties influence entrepreneurs' economic outcomes. The instrument of multiple name generators provides a vast amount of information that can be used to compute quantitative measures of the composition of networks. We show that both strength of ties and proportion of business ties have a significant positive impact on economic outcomes. It reveals the importance for small urban informal entrepreneurs to draw on both embedded social relations and more autonomous ones.",2012,Review of Social Economy
Sieve likelihood ratio statistics and Wilks phenomenon - eScholarship,"Variable Selection v i a Penalized Likelihood* JIANQING FAN RUNZE Li Department of Statistics University of California Los Angeles, CA 90095 Department of Statistics University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3260 June 14, 1999 Abstract Variable selection is vital to statistical data analyses. Many of procedures in use are ad hoc stepwise selection procedures, which are computationally expensive and ignore stochastic errors in the variable selection process of previous steps. An automatic and simultaneous variable selection procedure can be obtained by using a penalized likelihood method. In traditional linear models, the best subset selection and stepwise deletion methods coincide with a penalized least- squares method when design matrices are orthonormal. In this paper, we propose a few new approaches to selecting variables for linear models, robust regression models and generalized linear models based on a penalized likelihood approach. A family of thresholding functions are proposed. The LASSO proposed by Tibshirani (1996) is a member of the penalized least- squares with the Li-penalty. A smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty function is introduced to ameliorate the properties of Li-penalty. A unified algorithm is introduced, which is backed up by statistical theory. The new approaches are compared with the ordinary least- squares methods, the garrote method by Breiman (1995) and the LASSO method by Tibshirani (1996). Our simulation results show that the newly proposed methods compare favorably with other approaches as an automatic variable selection technique. Because of simultaneous selection of variables and estimation of parameters, we are able to give a simple estimated standard error formula, which is tested to be accurate enough for practical applications. Two real data examples illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches. K e y Words: Hard thresholding, LASSO, nonnegative garrote, SCAD, soft thresholding.

Beamforming of the Residuals is the LASSO's Dual,"Waves hidden in additive noise are observed by a sensor array. The waves are assumed to originate from a sparse set of sources. We treat the estimation of the sparse set of sources as a generalized complex-valued LASSO problem. The generalized complex-valued LASSO problem is strictly convex and strong duality holds. The corresponding dual problem is interpretable as a weighted conventional beamformer acting on the residuals of the LASSO. Moreover, this establishes a simple linear-affine relation between the dual and primal vectors. The solution path of the complex-valued LASSO is analyzed and three procedures for signal processing are proposed and evaluated which are based on the generalized LASSO and its dual: An order-recursive procedure and two iterative procedures which are based on a further approximation.",2015,ArXiv
The bridge between cognition and behavior in acquired brain injury: A graph theoretical approach,"BACKGROUND
The assumption is that executive dysfunctions (EF), associated with frontal lobe injury, are responsible for behavioral disturbances. Some studies do not find a relationship between EF and behavior following frontal lobe lesions. Our main goal of this study was to use a novel statistical method, graph theory, to analyze this relationship in different brain injury groups; frontal lobe damage, non-frontal lobe damage, and controls. Within the frontal group, we expect to find a pattern of executive nodes that are highly interconnected.


METHODS
For each group, we modeled the relationship between executive functions and behavior as a network of interdependent variables. The cognitive tests and the behavioral questionnaire are the ""nodes"" in the network, while the relationships between the nodes were modeled as the correlations between two nodes corrected for the correlation with all other nodes in the network. Sparse networks were estimated within each group using graphical LASSO. We analyzed the relative importance of the nodes within a network (centrality) and the clustering (modularity) of the different nodes.


RESULTS
Network analysis showed distinct patterns of relationships between EF and behavior in the three subgroups. The performance on the verbal learning test is the most central node in all the networks. In the frontal group, verbal memory forms a community with working memory and fluency. The behavioral nodes do not differentiate between groups or form clusters with cognitive nodes. No other communities were found for cognitive and behavioral nodes.


CONCLUSION
The cognitive phenotype of the frontal lobe damaged group, with its stability and proportion, might be theoretically interpreted as a potential ""buffer"" for possible cognitive executive deficits. This might explain some of the ambiguity found in the literature. This alternative approach on cognitive test scores provides a different and possibly complimentary perspective of the neuropsychology of brain-injured patients.",2019,Brain and Behavior
Thalassotaleaprofundi sp. nov. isolated from a deep-sea seamount.,"The Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, strictly aerobic, motile bacterial strain, designated YM155T, was isolated from a seamount near the Yap Trench in the tropical western Pacific. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain YM155T was related to the genus Thalassotalea and had highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with the type strains of Thalassotalea piscium T202T (97.2â€Š%) and Thalassotalea agariperforans M-M1T (97.2â€Š%). The predominant cellular fatty acids were C17â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰8c, summed feature 3 (composed of iso-C15â€Š:â€Š0 2-OH and/or C16â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰7c) and iso-C16â€Š:â€Š0. Ubiquinone 8 (Q-8) was the respiratory quinone. The polar lipid profile contained phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified phospholipids and one unidentified lipid. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain YM155T was 36.1â€‰mol%. On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain YM155T represents a novel species of the genus Thalassotalea, for which we propose the name Thalassotalea profundi sp. nov.

A Unified Framework for Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression: SR3,"Regularized regression problems are ubiquitous in statistical modeling, signal processing, and machine learning. Sparse regression, in particular, has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: 1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning; 2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations; and 3) the methods apply to composite regularizers, essential for total variation (TV) as well as sparsity-promoting formulations using tight frames. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, and greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity. Following standards of reproducible research, we also provide a companion MATLAB package that implements these examples.",2019,IEEE Access
Antimicrobial Central Venous Catheters: A Qualitative Review of the Literature and Economic Assessment,"â€¢ Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of antimicrobialassociated central venous catheters (CVCs) and to estimate costs related to their use. â€¢ Method: Review of the literature. The clinical database from the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) was used to conduct a retrospective analysis of clinical and economic outcomes in adult patients who had a CVC placed while in the intensive care unit (ICU). â€¢ Outcome measures: For the literature review, catheter colonization and CVC-related blood stream infection. For the UHC analysis, inhospital mortality, length of stay, number of ICU days, and cost of hospitalization. â€¢ Results: A total of 13 trials were included in the review. Eight showed that rate of catheter colonization was significantly reduced in recipients of antimicrobial catheters, while 2 demonstrated significant reductions in the incidence of bacteremia or septicemia compared with those who had standard devices inserted. In the UHC analysis, length of total hospital stay and length of ICU stay for infected patients (28.8 Â± 32.2 days and 14.6 Â± 17.1 days, respectively) was significantly longer compared with noninfected patients (18.5 Â± 19.7 days and 9 Â± 12. days, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). â€¢ Conclusion: Antimicrobial-associated CVCs are an effective approach to reducing the incidence of catheter colonization when they are inserted under full barrier precautions and are maintained using scrupulous infection control procedures. Some data indicate that these devices also reduce the incidence of CVCassociated bacteremia or septicemia, although the evidence for this conclusion is not as strong.",2000,
On compatible finite element models for elastic plastic analysis,"SommarioVengono analizzate alcune ipotesi esplicitmente o implicitamente assunte per la formulazione di elementi finiti usati nell'analisi elasto-plastica. Si mostra come l'assunzione indipendente di funzioni di interpolazione che governano i campi di spostamento e di deformazioni plastiche permetta di formulare legami costitutivi elasto-plastici globali per l'elemento. Vengono anche discusse alcune condizioni che devono essere rispettate per non irrigidire artificialmente l'elemento o non introdurvi una iperstaticitÃ  fittizia. Queste condizioni portano a definire elementi Â«consistentiÂ», le cui proprietÃ  vengono analizzate. Si fa anche notare come, nonostante l'uso di modelli congruenti, non vi sia sempre la garanzia di ottenere delimitazioni superiori al carico di collasso per problemi perfettamente plastici.Per semplicitÃ , la trattazione viene svolta con riferimento ad elementi di trave. La possibilitÃ  di estensione al continuo Ã¨ messa in luce nell'ultimo paragrafo.SummarySome implicit or explicit assumptions on which the formulation of compatible finite element models for elastic plastic analysis is based are considered. It is shown that it is possible to formulate global elastic plastic element laws by independently assuming interpolation functions governing the displacement and the plastic strain fields. Some consistency requirements are discussed, which must be enforced in order to avoid artificial stiffening or fictitious redundancy. When these requirements are met, a Â«consistentÂ» element is produced, whose properties are analyzed. It is also emphasized that, in spite of the use of compatible models, upper bounds to the collapse load are not always obtained for the limit analysis problem.For simplicity, beam elements are considered.

"LaSSO, a strategy for genome-wide mapping of intronic lariats and branch points using RNA-seq.","Both canonical and alternative splicing of RNAs are governed by intronic sequence elements and produce transient lariat structures fastened by branch points within introns. To map precisely the location of branch points on a genomic scale, we developed LaSSO (Lariat Sequence Site Origin), a data-driven algorithm which utilizes RNA-seq data. Using fission yeast cells lacking the debranching enzyme Dbr1, LaSSO not only accurately identified canonical splicing events, but also pinpointed novel, but rare, exon-skipping events, which may reflect aberrantly spliced transcripts. Compromised intron turnover perturbed gene regulation at multiple levels, including splicing and protein translation. Notably, Dbr1 function was also critical for the expression of mitochondrial genes and for the processing of self-spliced mitochondrial introns. LaSSO showed better sensitivity and accuracy than algorithms used for computational branch-point prediction or for empirical branch-point determination. Even when applied to a human data set acquired in the presence of debranching activity, LaSSO identified both canonical and exon-skipping branch points. LaSSO thus provides an effective approach for defining high-resolution maps of branch-site sequences and intronic elements on a genomic scale. LaSSO should be useful to validate introns and uncover branch-point sequences in any eukaryote, and it could be integrated into RNA-seq pipelines.",2014,Genome research
"Thalassobius aestuarii sp. nov., isolated from tidal flat sediment.","A strictly aerobic, non-motile, ovoid-shaped Alphaproteobacteria, designated strain JC2049(T), was isolated from a tidal flat sediment sample. The results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that this isolate belonged to the genus Thalassobius, with a sequence similarity of 96.9-97.3% to other valid Thalassobius spp. The cells required 1-7% NaCl for growth (optimum 2%) and accumulated poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate. Nitrite was reduced to nitrogen, but nitrate was not reduced to nitrite. No genetic potential for aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis was detected. The primary isoprenoid quinone (Ubiquinone-10), predominant cellular fatty acids (C(18:1)omega7c, 11 methyl C(18:1)omega7c and C(16:0)) and DNA G+C content (61 mol%) were all consistent with the assignment of this isolate to the genus Thalassobius. Several phenotypic characteristics clearly distinguished our isolate from other Thalassobius species. The degree of genomic relatedness between strain JC2049(T) and other Thalassobius species was in a range of 20-43%. The polyphasic data presented in this study indicates that our isolate should be classified as a novel species within the genus Thalassobius. The name Thalassobius aestuarii sp. nov. is therefore proposed for this isolate; the type strain is JC2049(T) (= IMSNU 14011(T) = KCTC 12049(T) = DSM 15283(T)).",2006,Journal of microbiology
Evaluating Effects of Tuition Fees: Lasso for the Case of Germany,"We study the effect of the introduction of university tuition fees on the enrollment behavior of students in Germany. For this, an appropriate Lasso-technique is crucial in order to identify the magnitude and significance of the effect due to potentially many relevant controlling factors and only a short time frame where fees existed. We show that a post-double selection strategy combined with stability selection determines a significant negative impact of fees on student enrollment and identifies relevant variables. This is in contrast to previous empirical studies and a plain linear panel regression which cannot detect any effect of tuition fees in this case. In our study, we explicitly deal with data challenges in the response variable in a transparent way and provide respective robust results. Moreover, we control for spatial cross-effects capturing the heterogeneity in the introduction scheme of fees across federal states (""Bundesl\""ander""), which can set their own educational policy. We also confirm the validity of our Lasso approach in a comprehensive simulation study.",2019,arXiv: Applications
"Megatherium, the stabber","The traditional point of view that fossil ground sloths (Xenarthra) were a relatively uniform, ecologically little diverse group has been recently challenged. Marine habits have been ascribed to Thalassocnus natans of the Pliocene of Peru. Also, a more diverse diet has been proposed by one of us (R. A. F.) for some Lujanian (late Pleistocene-early Holocene of South America) genera of ground sloths. In this paper, an aspect of this latter hypothesis is tested, i. e. that Megatherium americanum had morphological features that are better explained by its having had carnivorous habits rather than by solely herbivorous ones. Specifically, the question of its forearms having been designed for optimizing speed rather than strength of extension is addressed. Such a trait might have been associated with a potentially aggressive use of the animalâ€™s large claws, whereas a strong extension would be more proper for tearing branches out. On the other hand, the high mechanical advantage of the biceps might have made it possible for the animal to have lifted and carried heavy weights. This, in turn, suggests the possibility that the animal could have manipulated large prey (for instance, turning dorsally armoured preys or (for instance, turning dorsally armoured preys or carcasses upside down to expose softer parts) and cached large food pieces in a safer place. By this view, Megatherium americanum would be the largest land mammal hunter to have existed.",1996,Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences
On the Complexity of the Weighted Fused Lasso,"The solution path of the one-dimensional fused lasso for an <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-dimensional input is piecewise linear with at most <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX""> $\mathcal {O}(n)$</tex-math></inline-formula> segments.

Sponge symbioses between Xestospongia deweerdtae and Plakortis spp. are not motivated by shared chemical defense against predators,"The recently described epizoic sponge-sponge symbioses between Xestospongia deweerdtae and two species of Plakortis present an unusual series of sponge interactions. Sponges from the genus Plakortis are fierce allelopathic competitors, rich in cytotoxic secondary metabolites, and yet X. deweerdtae flourishes as an epizoic encrustation on Plakortis deweerdtaephila and Plakortis symbiotica. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that X. deweerdtae grows epizoic to these two species of Plakortis due to a shared chemical defense against predators. We collected free-living individuals of X. deweerdtae and symbiotic pairs from a wide geographical range to generate crude organic extracts and a series of polarity fractions from sponge extract. We tested the deterrency of these extracts against three common coral reef predators: the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, the Caribbean sharpnose puffer, Canthigaster rostrata, and the white spotwrist hermit crab, Pagurus criniticornis. While the chemical defenses of P. deweerdtaephila and P. symbiotica are more potent than those of X. deweerdtae, all of the sponge species we tested significantly deterred feeding in all three generalist predators. The free-living form of X. deweerdtae is mostly defended across the region, with a few exceptions. The associated form of X. deweerdtae is always defended, and both species of Plakortis are very strongly defended, with puffers refusing to consume extract-treated pellets until the extract was diluted to 1/256Ã— concentration. Using diode-array high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/IT-TOF), we found two secondary metabolites from P. deweerdtaephila, probably the cyclic endoperoxides plakinic acid I and plakinic acid K, in low concentrations in the associated-but not the free-living-form of X. deweerdtae, suggesting a possible translocation of defensive chemicals from the basibiont to the epibiont. Comparing the immense deterrency of Plakortis spp. extracts to the extracts of X. deweerdtae gives the impression that there may be some sharing of chemical defenses: one partner in the symbiosis is clearly more defended than the other and a small amount of its defensive chemistry may translocate to the partner. However, X. deweerdtae effectively deters predators with its own defensive chemistry. Multiple lines of evidence provide no support for the shared chemical defense hypothesis. Given the diversity of other potential food resources available to predators on coral reefs, it is improbable that the evolution of these specialized sponge-sponge symbioses has been driven by predation pressure.",2017,PLoS ONE
Network Lasso: Clustering and Optimization in Large Graphs,"Convex optimization is an essential tool for modern data analysis, as it provides a framework to formulate and solve many problems in machine learning and data mining. However, general convex optimization solvers do not scale well, and scalable solvers are often specialized to only work on a narrow class of problems. Therefore, there is a need for simple, scalable algorithms that can solve many common optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce the network lasso, a generalization of the group lasso to a network setting that allows for simultaneous clustering and optimization on graphs. We develop an algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve this problem in a distributed and scalable manner, which allows for guaranteed global convergence even on large graphs. We also examine a non-convex extension of this approach. We then demonstrate that many types of problems can be expressed in our framework. We focus on three in particular --- binary classification, predicting housing prices, and event detection in time series data --- comparing the network lasso to baseline approaches and showing that it is both a fast and accurate method of solving large optimization problems.",2015,KDD : proceedings.

[Arthroscopic refixation of acute proximal anterior cruciate ligament rupture using suture anchors].,"OBJECTIVE
Arthroscopic assisted suture anchor refixation combined with microfracturing of the femoral ACL insertion zone in cases of acute proximal anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture to restore anatomical and biomechanical properties of the native ACL.


INDICATIONS
Acute proximal ACL rupture/avulsion, multiligament injury of the knee CONTRAINDICATIONS: Chronic (>6Â weeks) proximal ACL rupture, intraligamentary rupture, as well as previous ACL surgery.


SURGICAL TECHNIQUE
Arthroscopic examination of the knee joint, debridement of the femoral insertion zone, examination of the ligament quality by aÂ probe, insertion of aÂ curved lasso through the ACL to place the sutures and use of aÂ drill guide to place the anchor in the middle of the femoral ACL insertion. Microfracturing holes around the femoral footprint were made by an awl to enhance healing properties of the ACL.


POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT
Partial weight bearing was permitted and crutches were used for 6Â weeks, knee brace limited for the first 2Â weeks 0â€‘0-0Â°, then 0â€‘0-90Â° for the following 4Â weeks.


RESULTS
AÂ total of 20Â patients who underwent acute proximal ACL suture anchor refixation were evaluated after aÂ mean follow-up of 28Â months. Regarding stability, mean values of the KT-1000 arthrometer indicated stable results (<3Â mm), 3Â patients had aÂ 1+ Lachman and 4Â patients had aÂ 1+ pivot shift. IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) score indicated that 17 cases were very good to good (12A, 4B) and in 3 cases the results were satisfactory (3C). Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the ALC was found to be intact in 17Â cases. The total rate of revision was 15â€‰% (3/20) because of recurrent instability.",2017,Operative Orthopadie und Traumatologie
Robust and Sparse Estimation of the Inverse Covariance Matrix Using Rank Correlation Measures,"Spearman's rank correlation is a robust alternative for the standard correlation coefficient. By using ranks instead of the actual values of the observations, the impact of outliers remains limited. In this paper, we study an estimator based on this rank correlation measure for estimating covariance matrices and their inverses. The resulting estimator is robust and consistent at the normal distribution. By applying the graphical lasso, the inverse covariance matrix estimator is positive definite if more variables than observations are available in the data set. Moreover, it will contain many zeros, and is therefore said to be sparse. Instead of Spearman's rank correlation, one can use the Quadrant correlation or Gaussian rank scores. A simulation study compares the different estimators. This type of estimator is particularly useful for estimating (inverse) covariance matrices in high dimensions, when the data may contain several outliers in many cells of the data matrix. More traditional robust estimators are not well defined or computable in this setting. An important feature of the proposed estimators is their simplicity and easiness to compute using existing software.",2015,
Penalized methods and algorithms for high-dimensional regression in the presence of heterogeneity,"In fields such as statistics, economics and biology, heterogeneity is an important topic concerning validity of data inference and discovery of hidden patterns. This thesis focuses on penalized methods for regression analysis with the presence of heterogeneity in a potentially high-dimensional setting. Two possible strategies to deal with heterogeneity are: robust regression methods that provide heterogeneity-resistant coefficient estimation, and direct detection of heterogeneity while estimating coefficients accurately in the meantime. We consider the first strategy for two robust regression methods, Huber loss regression and quantile regression with Lasso or Elastic-Net penalties, which have been studied theoretically but lack efficient algorithms. We propose a new algorithm Semismooth Newton Coordinate Descent to solve them. The algorithm is a novel combination of Semismooth Newton Algorithm and Coordinate Descent that applies to penalized optimization problems with both nonsmooth loss and nonsmooth penalty. We prove its convergence properties, and show its computational efficiency through numerical studies. We also propose a nonconvex penalized regression method, Heterogeneity Discovery Regression (HDR) , as a realization of the second idea. We establish theoretical results that guarantees statistical precision for any local optimum of the objective function with high probability. We also compare the numerical performances of HDR with competitors including Huber loss regression, quantile regression and least squares through simulation studies and a real data example. In these experiments, HDR methods are able to detect heterogeneity accurately, and also largely outperform the competitors in terms of coefficient estimation and variable selection.",2016,
Forecasting Bitcoin Returns: Is there a Role for the U.S. â€“ China Trade War?,"Previous studies provide evidence that trade related uncertainty tends to predict an increase in Bitcoin returns. In this paper, we extend the related literature by examining whether the information on the U.S. â€“ China trade war can be used to forecast the future path of Bitcoin returns controlling for various explanatory variables. We apply ordinary least square (OLS) regression, support vector regression (SVR), and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) techniques that stem from the field of machine learning, and find weak evidence of the role of the trade war in forecasting Bitcoin returns. Given that out-of-sample tests are more reliable than in-sample tests, our results tend to suggest that future Bitcoin returns are unaffected by trade related uncertainties, and investors can use Bitcoin as a safe haven in this context.",2019,
Strategies for the Mitigation of Oxysterol-Induced Cytotoxicity,"Strategies for the Mitigation of OxysterolInduced Cytotoxicity By Jacques M. Mathieu Chronic exposure to some oxysterols might contribute to deterioration of human or environmental health. Oxysterols are both biomarkers of oxidative stress as well as mediators of its damage, and play a central role in many independent, but converging, disease processes, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to identify enzymes capable of transforming oxysterols to either reduce their toxicity or facilitate their metabolism or excretion. 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), being amongst the most cytotoxic and recalcitrant of these compounds, was the main focus of this work. We isolated various bacteria capable of utilizing 7KC as a sole carbon and energy source. One of these, Rhodococcus jostii RHA 1, was subjected to rigorous transcriptomic and mutational analysis to elucidate its 7KC degradation pathway, which was similar, but not identical, to that of cholesterol. Metabolite screening revealed the reduction and subsequent removal of the 7 -keto moiety prior to the step catalyzed by HsaC, the enzyme responsible for cleavage of sterol ring A. Furthermore, cloning and expression of a number of reductases from two gene clusters that were highly up-regulated during growth on 7KC identified three reductases that are active against several closely related structural analogs, though not 7KC itself. 7KC and a number of analogs were assayed for toxicity against human fibroblasts. Several enzymes were overexpressed in these fibroblasts by transient transfection with mammalian expression vectors to screen for their ability to mitigate 7KC-induced cytotoxicity. A LAMP1/choiesteroi oxidase chimera was found to be significantly cytoprotective to exposure to up to 50 IJM 7KC compared to mock transfection as well as 7KC-transforming enzymes targeted to either the mitochondria or cytosol. Additionally, transfection with LAMP1 alone and treatment with 0.9% hydroxypropyl ~-cyclodextrin also reduced toxicity. Therefore, it seems likely that addressing 7KC toxicity within the lysosome is critical for cytoprotection. This work provides preliminary evidence to support this approach, and may have implications for the treatment of oxysterolassociated diseases. However, further research is needed to evaluate the effects and safety of heterologous gene expression within the lysosome, both in vitro and in vivo.",2011,
Testing Shape Constraints in Lasso Regularized Joinpoint Regression,"Joinpoint regression models are very popular in some practical areas mainly due to a very simple interpretation which they offer. In some situations, moreover, it turns out to be also useful to require some additional qualitative properties for the final model to be satisfied. Especially properties related to the monotonicity of the fit are of the main interest in this paper. We propose a LASSO regularized approach to estimate these types of models where the optional shape constraints can be implemented in a straightforward way as a set of linear inequalities and they are considered simultaneously within the estimation process itself. As the main result we derive a testing approach which can be effectively used to statistically verify the validity of the imposed shape restrictions in piecewise linear continuous models. We also investigate some finite sample properties via a simulation study.",2015,
Online Group Feature Selection,"Online feature selection with dynamic features has become an active research area in recent years. However, in some real-world applications such as image analysis and email spam filtering, features may arrive by groups. Existing online feature selection methods evaluate features individually, while existing group feature selection methods cannot handle online processing. Motivated by this, we formulate the online group feature selection problem, and propose a novel selection approach for this problem. Our proposed approach consists of two stages: online intra-group selection and online inter-group selection. In the intra-group selection, we use spectral analysis to select discriminative features in each group when it arrives. In the inter-group selection, we use Lasso to select a globally optimal subset of features. This 2-stage procedure continues until there are no more features to come or some predefined stopping conditions are met. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark and real-world data sets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art online feature selection methods.",2013,
Computational studies of protein interactions and genetic regulation,"The work in this thesis is split into two parts. The introduction and following two chapters pertain to the investigation of gene regulation using Chip-seq data and linear modelling. The final chapter pertains to the prediction of hot-spot residues in protein-protein interactions. 
 
The rapid escalation in the speed and quality of DNA sequencing has lead to a wealth of data for the location of transcription factor binding and histone modifications across the genomes. Using Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, we have generated a new binding metric based on the enrichment of the read-counts for each gene. 
 
Eight datasets from mouse macrophage cells (two histone modifications, five transcription factors, DNase I hypersensitivity) were used to model the binding of RNA polymerase II. It was found that a linear model just using the DNase I hypersensitivity and histone modification data 
was better than any of the models containing the transcription factor data. Investigation of the outlying genes for the model revealed no pattern in their Gene Ontology terms or macrophagespecific genes. 
 
Human embryonic stem cell data (23 transcription factor and 24 histone modification datasets) were used in combination with LASSO regression to model the binding of RNA polymerase II. The resultant models contrasted with the results from the mouse macrophage linear models in 
that using the histone modifications data in combination with the transcription factor data lead to the best models. A much more complicated picture of the regulation of RNA polymerase II binding was produced using the LASSO models. 
 
Protein-protein interactions are essential for every function within a cell and being able to predict them has large consequences for drug discovery and understanding the vast proteininteraction networks that occur within cells. Predicting protein-protein interactions is difficult 
due to the large number of possible conformations; predicting hot-spot residues can greatly reduce this. InterBasePro was compared with experimental data and subsequently adaptation was done to assess its usefulness for predicting hot-spot residues. An alternative approach 
was also made into classifying hot-spot residues based on atomic contacts.",2013,
An effective seven-CpG-based signature to predict survival in renal clear cell carcinoma by integrating DNA methylation and gene expression.,"AIMS
Currently, using clinicopathological risk factors only is not far from effective to evaluate the risk of disease progression in renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) patients. Molecular biomarkers might improve risk stratification of KIRC. DNA methylation occurs the whole process of tumor development and transcriptional disorders are also one of the important characteristics of tumor. Hence, this study aims to develop an effective and independent prognostic signature for KIRC patients by Integrating DNA methylation and gene expression.


MAIN METHODS
Difference analysis was conducted on DNA methylation sites and gene expression data. The Spearman's rank correlation and univariate Cox regression analysis were used to screen out the CpG sites that related with RNAs' expression and KIRC patients' overall survival. Then, a five-CpG-based prognostic classifier was established using LASSO Cox regression method.


KEY FINDINGS
The seven-CpG-based classifier can successfully divide KIRC patients into high-risk from low-risk groups, even after adjustment for standard clinical prognostic factors, such as age, stage, gender and grade. Moreover, the seven-CpG-based signature was more effective as independent prognostic factors than the combined model of these clinical factors. Six differential mRNA genes corresponding to the seven CpG sites are all related to human cancers by functional exploration. The gene functional and pathway enrichment analysis found that genes in immune-related pathways were remarkably different in high and low-risk groups.


SIGNIFICANCE
The new seven-CpG-based signature could helpfully provide insights into the underlying mechanism of KIRC and may be a powerful independent biomarker for predicting of the survival of KIRC patients.",2020,Life sciences
High Dimensional Nonstationary Time Series Modelling with Generalized Dynamic Semiparametric Factor Model,"(High dimensional) time series which reveal nonstationary and possibly periodic behavior occur frequently in many fields of science. In this article, we separate the modeling of high dimensional time series to time propagation of low dimensional time series and high dimensional time invariant functions via functional factor analysis. We propose a two-step estimation procedure. At the first step, we detect the deterministic trends of the time series by incorporating time basis selected by the group Lasso-type technique and choose the space basis based on smoothed functional principal component analysis. We show properties of this estimator under various situations extending current variable selection studies. At the second step, we obtain the detrended low dimensional stochastic process, but it also poses an important question: is it justified, from an inferential point of view, to base further statistical inference on the estimated stochastic time series? We show that the difference of the inference based on the estimated time series and ""true"" unobserved time series is asymptotically negligible, which finally allows one to study the dynamics of the whole high-dimensional system with a low dimensional representation together with the deterministic trend. We apply the method to our motivating empirical problems: studies of the dynamic behavior of temperatures (further used for pricing weather derivatives), implied volatilities and risk patterns and correlated brain activities (neuro-economics related) using fMRI data, where a panel version model is also presented.",2010,
Data-driven modeling of sleep EEG and EOG reveals characteristics indicative of pre-Parkinson's and Parkinson's disease,"BACKGROUND
Manual scoring of sleep relies on identifying certain characteristics in polysomnograph (PSG) signals. However, these characteristics are disrupted in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.


NEW METHOD
This study evaluates sleep using a topic modeling and unsupervised learning approach to identify sleep topics directly from electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG). PSG data from control subjects were used to develop an EOG and an EEG topic model. The models were applied to PSG data from 23 control subjects, 25 patients with periodic leg movements (PLMs), 31 patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and 36 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The data were divided into training and validation datasets and features reflecting EEG and EOG characteristics based on topics were computed. The most discriminative feature subset for separating iRBD/PD and PLM/controls was estimated using a Lasso-regularized regression model.


RESULTS
The features with highest discriminability were the number and stability of EEG topics linked to REM and N3, respectively. Validation of the model indicated a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 68.8% when classifying iRBD/PD patients.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD
The topics showed visual accordance with the manually scored sleep stages, and the features revealed sleep characteristics containing information indicative of neurodegeneration.


CONCLUSIONS
This study suggests that the amount of N3 and the ability to maintain NREM and REM sleep have potential as early PD biomarkers. Data-driven analysis of sleep may contribute to the evaluation of neurodegenerative patients.",2014,Journal of Neuroscience Methods
The selective cleaning behaviour of juvenile blue-headed wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) in the Caribbean,"Through the removal of parasites, dead skin and mucus from the bodies of visiting reef fish (clients), cleaner fish have a significant ecosystem function in the ecology of coral reefs. Cleaners gain nutrition from these interactions and through offering a 'service' are afforded protection from predators. Given these benefits, it is unclear why more fish do not engage in cleaning, and why part-time cleaning strategies exist. On coral reefs, dedicated species clean throughout their life, whereas some species are facultative, employing opportunistic and/or temporary cleaning strategies. Here, we investigate the cleaning behaviour of a facultative species to assess the relative importance of this interaction to the cleaner. Using a combination of focal and event sampling from a coral reef in Tobago, we show that cleaning is not an essential food source for facultative juvenile blue-headed wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), as cleaning rate was unrelated to their foraging rate on the substrate. These wrasse displayed two cleaning strategies: stationary versus wandering cleaning, with cleaning frequency being highest for stationary cleaners. A specific cleaning location facilitated increased cleaning frequency, and wrasse cleaning rate decreased as cleaner or client abundance increased. We also compared juvenile blue-headed wrasse cleaning behaviour to a resident dedicated cleaner, the sharknose goby (Elacatinus evelynae), and showed that, in comparison, juvenile wrasse clean a narrower client range, predominately cleaning three species of gregarious free-ranging surgeonfish (Acanthurus spp.). The wrasse, however, frequently approached these clients without cleaning, which suggests that their selective cleaning strategy may be driven by the acquisition of a particular parasitic food source. Juvenile blue-headed wrasse are generalist foragers, and may thus be limited in their cleaning behaviour by their nutritional requirements, the availability of a suitable cleaning site, and fish density, which ultimately means that they do not adopt more dedicated cleaning roles within the reef community.",2018,Behavioural Processes
"First census of breeding seabirds between Cap Bienvenue (Terre AdÃ©lie) and Moyes Islands (King George V Land), Antarctica: new records for Antarctic seabird populations","Abstract Breeding population sizes of penguins, fulmarine etrels and skuas were estimated for the first time on a major part of the Terre AdÃ©lie coast and a section of the King George V Land coast during the 1997/1998 austral summer. We counted 106,400 breeding pairs and 12,400 AdÃ©lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks by direct counts, and 6960 breeding pairs from aerial photographs. Minimum breeding populations for other species are (direct counts): Antarctic fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides) 6861 pairs, Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) 4574 pairs, cape petrel (Daption capense) 194 pairs, snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea) 767 pairs, south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki) 129 pairs and subantarctic skua (Catharacta lonnbergi) 1 breeding bird. We discovered 29 new seabird breeding locations in King George V Land, including 6 Antarctic fulmar, 4 Antarctic petrel, 3 cape petrel, 6 snow petrel and 10 south polar skua colonies. The largest colonies found contained up to 4205 breeding pairs of Antarctic fulmars. Population sizes of all species obtained in this study are higher than those found during previous partial surveys. Although these differences are in great part due to differences in survey methods, they also reflect real population changes. Our minimum population sizes obtained for a small portion of the Antarctic coast (<2%) suggest an underestimation of the estimated world breeding populations for several species of Antarctic seabirds.",1999,Polar Biology
"Very Low Phytoplankton Diversity in a Tropical Saline-Alkaline Lake, with Co-dominance of Arthrospira fusiformis (Cyanobacteria) and Picocystis salinarum (Chlorophyta)","Lake Dziani Dzaha (Mayotte Island, Indian Ocean) is a tropical thalassohaline lake which geochemical and biological conditions make it a unique aquatic ecosystem considered as a modern analogue of Precambrian environments. In the present study, we focused on the diversity of phytoplanktonic communities, which produce very high and stable biomass (mean2014â€“2015â€‰=â€‰652â€‰Â±â€‰179Â Î¼gÂ chlorophyll aÂ Lâˆ’1). As predicted by classical community ecology paradigms, and as observed in similar environments, a single species is expected to dominate the phytoplanktonic communities. To test this hypothesis, we sampled water column in the deepest part of the lake (18Â m) during rainy and dry seasons for two consecutive years. Phytoplanktonic communities were characterized using a combination of metagenomic, microscopy-based and flow cytometry approaches, and we used statistical modeling to identify the environmental factors determining the abundance of dominant organisms. As hypothesized, the overall diversity of the phytoplanktonic communities was very low (15 OTUs), but we observed a co-dominance of two, and not only one, OTUs, viz., Arthrospira fusiformis (Cyanobacteria) and Picocystis salinarum (Chlorophyta). We observed a decrease in the abundance of these co-dominant taxa along the depth profile and identified the adverse environmental factors driving this decline. The functional traits measured on isolated strains of these two taxa (i.e., size, pigment composition, and concentration) are then compared and discussed to explain their capacity to cope with the extreme environmental conditions encountered in the aphotic, anoxic, and sulfidic layers of the water column of Lake Dziani Dzaha.",2019,Microbial Ecology
A joint convex penalty for inverse covariance matrix estimation,The paper proposes a joint convex penalty for estimating the Gaussian inverse covariance matrix. A proximal gradient method is developed to solve the resulting optimization problem with more than one penalty constraints. The analysis shows that imposing a single constraint is not enough and the estimator can be improved by a trade-off between two convex penalties. The developed framework can be extended to solve wide arrays of constrained convex optimization problems. A simulation study is carried out to compare the performance of the proposed method to graphical lasso and the SPICE estimate of the inverse covariance matrix.,2014,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
"sGnRHâ€A [(dâ€Arg6, Pro9, NEtâ€)LHRH] in combination with domperidone induces gonad reversal in a protogynous fish, the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum","The effects of thrice weekly injections of Ovaprim (sGnRH-A in combination with domperidone) on the ovary of Thalassoma bifasciatum, a protogynous marine fish, after 4 and 6 weeks are described. At the end of 4 weeks of treatment, 72% (n=13) of the original females showed signs of reversal. The majority of these were deemed early stage although mid- (n=2) and late (n=1) stage reversals were present. At 6 weeks, 92% of the females had ovaries that were undergoing transformation. None of these, however, progressed beyond the early stage. Only 3.8% of the control fish showed signs of reversal over the same periods. The blue head colour pattern, typical of the terminal phase, did not appear in any of the fish.

Disconnection Syndrome in Callosal Agenesis,"The previous chapters have confirmed the notion that callosal agenesis may be considered as a natural model of hemispheric disconnection. In fact, this observation initially prompted several investigators to evaluate acallosal subjects in a number of tasks requiring interhemispheric communication (for reviews, see Milner and Jeeves, 1979; Chiarello, 1980; Jeeves, this volume; Milner, this volume). Most of the early work, however, emphasized the fact that callosal agenesis did not produce the disconnection syndrome observed after surgical section of the callosal commissure. Typically, acallosal subjects were reported to have no difficulties cross-matching objects, shapes or other stimuli placed in each hand out of view and they showed no impairments in tachistoscopic tasks requiring half-field comparisons. A similar pattern of results has been reported for tasks involving recognition of material presented unilaterally. With a few exceptions (e.g. Ettlinger et al., 1972; Donoso and Santander, 1982), acallosals, unlike callosotomized patients, did not show hemialexia for letters or words tachistoscopically projected to the left visual hemifield nor did they display anomia for objects palpated by the left hand (e.g. Milner and Jeeves, 1979; Sauerwein et al., 1981; Sauerwein and Lassonde, 1983).",1994,
Sequence diversity in the lasso peptide framework: discovery of functional microcin J25 variants with multiple amino acid substitutions.,"Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is a ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptide that has an unusual threaded lasso structure in which the C-terminal ""tail"" of the peptide is fed through a macrocyclic ""ring"" formed by the N-terminal residues. Production of MccJ25 in Escherichia coli is dependent upon a four-gene cluster encoding the structural gene mcjA, two maturation enzymes mcjB and mcjC, and an immunity factor, mcjD, in the form of an MccJ25 export pump. Here we have developed a system for orthogonal control of the expression of mcjA and mcjD, thus permitting independent control of MccJ25 production and export/immunity in E. coli. We used this system to screen saturation mutagenesis libraries targeted to either the ring or tail portions of MccJ25 and discovered nearly 100 new MccJ25 variants that retain antimicrobial function. While multiple amino acid substitutions in the tail portion of the peptide are well-tolerated, mutagenesis of the ring portion of the peptide is detrimental to the antimicrobial function of MccJ25. We demonstrated that the decreased function of the ring variants is due to the inability of these variants to be transported to the cytoplasm of susceptible strains. Additionally, we found several MccJ25 variants from the tail library with improved efficacy toward the MccJ25-sensitive strains E. coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Newport with the best variants exhibiting a nearly 5-fold increase in potency. The results described here provide further evidence that diverse amino acid sequences can be tolerated by the rigid lasso peptide fold.",2011,Journal of the American Chemical Society
The population-environment nexus and vulnerability assessment in Africa,"Rapid population growth and associated negative settlement changes, eg hyper-urbanization, as well as environmental degradation have been frequently cited as inextricably linked phenomena which should be of grave concern to natural scientists and sociopolitical policymakers alike. Examples abound from both the popular press as well as serious scientific fields (Repetto and Holmes 1983; Pingali and Biswanger 1984; Blaikie and Unwin 1988; Wisner 1988; Brown 1989; Cleaver and Schreiber 1993 ; Hardin 1993 ; Jazairy et al. 1993 ; White 1993 ; King 1993; Kaplan 1994). In some of this literature, cases from Africa are frequently cited as ""worst-case scenarios"" that prove the ultimate validity of the ""Malthusian nightmare"" as a fundamental demographic and consequent environmental security reality that should transcend every analysis of sustainable development or international security trends in the region (Meillassoux et al. 1991; Shaikh and Snrech 1993). Negative events or conditions evident in countries such as Rwanda, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Liberia, Guinea, Angola, and elsewhere are most frequently cited. The Rwandan case is the most vivid as of summer 1994 (Pagni 1982; Futures Group 1990; Falloux and Talbot 1993; Charlery 1993; Clay 1993; Bart 1993; Clay and Reardon 1994; Honadle et al. 1994). The question I want to explore is the following: Are current situations of political or environmental vulnerability and chaos in Africa better explained by population pressure on resources or are other explanations, or combinations of explanations, equally or more satisfying, eg technology, politics, culture, social disorganization, and so on?

Bayesian Nonparametric Sparse Vector Autoregressive Models,"Seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models are useful in studying the interactions among economic variables. In a high dimensional setting, these models require a large number of parameters to be estimated and suffer of inferential problems. To avoid overparametrization issues, we propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process prior (DPP) for SUR models, which allows shrinkage of coefficients toward multiple locations. We propose a two-stage hierarchical prior distribution, where the first stage of the hierarchy consists in a lasso conditionally independent prior of the Normal-Gamma family for the coefficients. The second stage is given by a random mixture distribution, which allows for parameter parsimony through two components: the first is a random Dirac point-mass distribution, which induces sparsity in the coefficients; the second is a DPP, which allows for clustering of the coefficients.",2018,
Sa38: Gwas-based Machine Learning Approach to Predict Duloxetine Response and Remission in Major Depressive Disorder,"Background Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and is commonly treated with antidepressant drugs. However, large variability is observed in terms of response to antidepressants. GWAS based Machine Learning (ML) models may be useful to predict treatment response, thus improving antidepressant treatment. Methods A sample of 186 MDD patients received treatment with duloxetine for up to 8 weeks were categorized as â€œrespondersâ€ based on a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) change >50% from baseline; or â€œremittersâ€ based on a MADRS score of 10 or lower at end point. The initial dataset (N=186) was randomly divided into training and test sets (70% and 30%, or 130 and 56 individuals respectively), resulting in ten different training and test set pairs. A genome-wide logistic regression was performed to identify potentially significant variants related to duloxetine response/remission and extracted the most promising predictors using LASSO regression. Subsequently, Classification-Regression Trees (CRT) and support vector machines (SVM) were applied to construct models, using ten-fold, repeated cross-validation. Results For the response phenotype, LASSO regression suggested twenty SNPs to be entered in prediction models. Calculated models for response achieved accuracy of 63.43% for CRT and 78.93% for SVM. For the remission phenotype, LASSO filtering suggested five SNPs. Best models were characterized by an accuracy of 65.45% with a sensitivity of 69.31% and specificity of 61.43%. Discussion In this study, the potential of using GWAS data to predict duloxetine response was examined using ML models. These models managed to capture a fraction of responders and remitters (i.e. moderate sensitivity), but failed to filter out non-responders and non-remitters (i.e. low specificity). Inclusion of additional non-genetic variables to create integrated models may help improve prediction results.",2019,European Neuropsychopharmacology
Regression Approaches for Microarray Data Analysis,"A variety of new procedures have been devised to handle the two-sample comparison (e.g., tumor versus normal tissue) of gene expression values as measured with microarrays. Such new methods are required in part because of some defining characteristics of microarray-based studies: (i) the very large number of genes contributing expression measures which far exceeds the number of samples (observations) available and (ii) the fact that by virtue of pathway/network relationships, the gene expression measures tend to be highly correlated. These concerns are exacerbated in the regression setting, where the objective is to relate gene expression, simultaneously for multiple genes, to some external outcome or phenotype. Correspondingly, several methods have been recently proposed for addressing these issues. We briefly critique some of these methods prior to a detailed evaluation of gene harvesting. This reveals that gene harvesting, without additional constraints, can yield artifactual solutions. Results obtained employing such constraints motivate the use of regularized regression procedures such as the lasso, least angle regression, and support vector machines. Model selection and solution multiplicity issues are also discussed. The methods are evaluated using a microarray-based study of cardiomyopathy in transgenic mice.",2003,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology
Why a Eurozone Collapse should not be a Surprise: The Role of Germany and Greece,"The US subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-2009 spread to Europe, where it morphed into the Eurocrisis, or the European Sovereign Debt Crisis. Total recovery from the Eurocrisis is still not imminent, and a collapse of the Eurozone and even the EU is possible. Austerity is widely accepted as a major reason for prolonging the financial crisis in the Eurozone. Such austerity was primarily imposed on the Eurozone members by Germany and its northern allies. In addition to the financial crisis, a geopolitical crisis has also emerged. Much dissent towards the handling of both of these crises exists in the EU, leading to a rise of Euroscepticism, nationalism, and anti-EU populist political parties. This paper explores how different scenarios could evolve into the breakup of the EMU or a possible recovery from the Eurocrisis. Perche il collasso dellâ€™Eurozona non sarebbe una sorpresa: il ruolo della Germania e della Grecia La crisi dei mutui bancari negli USA del 2007-2009 si e propagata in Europa sfociando nella crisi dellâ€™Euro e nella crisi del debito sovrano europeo.

Contributo alla conoscenza dei fenomeni carsici di collasso in zone costiere del Salento jonico (Puglia): La spunnulata della Pajara,"It Spunnulata, inteso nel significato di rottura di una superfice topografica, e un termine dialettale usato nella Penisola Salentina (Nardo, Sud Italia) per descrivere un elemento geomorfologico del paesaggio costiero che si manifesta come uno sprofondamento in genere ampio, ma non particolarmente profondo. Le ""spunnulate"", che hanno dimensioni variabili da poche a diverse decine di metri, sono forme che possono essere ascritte alla categoria delle doline di crollo. Molte di esse non raggiungono il livello di falda, altre creano bacini e laghetti salmastri, poche sono direttamente collegate col mare aperto attraverso gallerie sommerse. L'area in esame e circoscritta a una piccola striscia allungata della costa di Sant'Isidoro (Nardo), dove la piana costiera e interpretabile come il risultato morfologico di un'azione combinata di fattori carsico-marini. La struttura geologica dell'area in esame e rappresentata alla base da calcari e da dolomie del Cretaceo superiore, ricoperti da sottili depositi trasgressivi di calcareniti del Pleistocene inferiore. Nella depressione morfologica della ""Palude del Capitano"", la sequenza geologica e chiusa in cima da depositi colluviali recenti dell'Olocene, quali argille, limi, sabbie e ""terre rosse"". L'esame dei macro-elementi morfologici di questa porzione di territorio rivela essenzialmente che le forme carsiche profonde devono essere interpretate geneticamente nella relazione di contatto delle due unita litologiche con l'azione combinata esercitata dall'acquifero carsico che fluisce verso il mare e da quella d'ingressione marina continentale nel basamento roccioso fratturato. Il processo carsico nelle rocce carbonatiche di un ambiente costiero produce un'esaltazione della dissoluzione a causa delle caratteristiche chimiche e fisiche delle acque salmastre che sviluppano le condizioni di un processo ipercarsico. La Spunnulata della Pajara e una cavita sommersa di collasso che e stata esplorata recentemente. Essa si apre in superficie nelle calcareniti e si sviluppa in profondita nei sottostanti calcari. L'ambiente subacqueo e ingombro nella sua parte occidentale dai resti del collasso della superficie topografica. La parte orientale e composta da una bassa caverna articolata da stretti passaggi di difficile percorrenza. Le pareti e la volta mostrano forme erosive di flusso e alveoli e canalicoli carsici che evidenziano un esteso sistema, dall'aspetto spugnoso, creato dall'azione ipercarsica della miscela delle acque di base con quelle di ingressione marina continentale. In diversi punti della volta si conservano tasche di terre gialle che inglobano frammenti calcarei a spigoli vivi. Le immersioni subacquee in questa cavita presentano un'alta pericolosita a causa del facile distacco di detriti dalle tasche terrose della volta, che rendono nulla la visibilita alla progressione. En A Spunnulata â€“ meaning a break in a surface - is a dialectal word used in the Salento Peninsula (Apulia, South Italy) to describe a coastal landform. Typically, a spunnulata is a wide sinkhole, not particularly deep, varying in size from a few to several meters, and may be classified as a collapse doline. Many of these sinkholes do not reach the water table, others form small brackish pools, while a few others are connected directly to the open sea through submerged tunnels. The area studied refers to a stretch of the Ionian coast south of Sant'Isidoro (Nardo, Lecce province) where the coastal plain is the morphological result of the combined action of karst and marine processes. The geological bedrock is represented by Upper Cretaceous limestone and dolomites, overlaid by thin transgressive Lower Pleistocene calcarenites. In the Palude del Capitano swamp land, the geological sequence is closed at the top by recent Holocene deposits of clays, silts, sands and ""terre rosse"". A study of the morphological macro-elements in this area reveals that the deep karstic forms should genetically be linked to the contact of two lithological units with the combined action of the karst aquifer downflowing to the sea and marine water intrusion in the fractured bedrock. Karst processes in coastal carbonate rocks enhance dissolution because of the chemical and physical characteristics of the brackish water fostering the conditions for a hyperkarstic process. The Spunnulata della Pajara is a submerged collapse cave that has been recently explored. It opens up at the surface in calcarenites and continues down into the underlying limestones. The underwater room is cluttered by collapse blocks in the western side, while on the opposite a complex large and low room makes difficult the exploration, due to narrow section of the passages. Along the walls and the ceiling are widespread erosive forms (scallops), as well as a large distribution of cells and fine channels (sponge-works) testifying the hyperkarstic action of the mixing waters. In various points of the ceiling are preserved pockets of yellow soils which include sharp-edged limestone debris. The scuba diving in this cave has a hazardous profile due to the frequent detachment of debris from the ceiling pockets containing yellow soils.",2018,
The adaptive pattern of growth and reproduction of the colonial hydroid Clavopsella michaeli,"Istituto Sperimentale Talassografico C.N.R. 'A. Cerruti' via Roma 3, 74100 Taranto, ItalyKey words: Hydroids, growth, reproduction, control mechanismsAbstractThe effects of variations in temperature, salinity and water movement on the laboratory growth andreproduction of a single clone of the bougainvilliid hydroid Clavopsella michaeli were examined. Unfavour-able conditions resulted in reproducible oscillations of growth rate. They ranged from overall stimulatoryeffects (hormesis) to irreversible inhibition and shrinkage of colonies. Exposure to low concentrations(0.1-5 jug 1- ') of copper and mercury ions produced similar responses, which were therefore regardedas non-specific. A control mechanism, dampening these growth rate oscillations, supported highercolonial tolerance, that is adaptation, to environmental stresses of low intensity. When the counteractivecapacity of the control mechanism was exceeded, inhibition occurred. Higher frequencies of gonozooidswere observed in stressed colonies and were interpreted as an adaptive response.IntroductionColonial hydroids usually show high plasticity ofdevelopment. Morphogenesis depends upon mul-tiple interactions between different cell compart-ments and proclivities (Braverman, 1974). Butepigenetic influences, such as changes in environ-mental variables, have been shown to be relevantin affecting the kinetics and patterns of colonialgrowth (Berrill, 1949; Braverman, 1963; Crowell,1957; Fulton, 1962; Kinne, 1956, 1958; Kinne P Loomis, 1954).Neither hydranth formation nor stolon elon-gation occur at regular rates, but exhibit recurrentoscillations (Braverman, 1974; Kinne & Paffen-h6fer, 1966; Piraino & De Nicola, in press) andmay reflect the separation of the growing pointsand the cell proliferation sites (Hale, 1964;Wyttenbach, 1968), and a hydranth-mediatedfeedback control of new hydranth formation(Braverman, 1974).Stebbing (1976, 1981, 1982) emphasized thecharacteristically higher oscillatory growth ofLaomedeaflexuosa colonies exposed to subinhibi-tory levels of pollutants. By lowering stress-induced oscillations of growth rate, adaptationof colonies to unfavourable conditions was en-hanced.Besides undergoing growth rate fluctuations,hydroids may shift more energy into sexual repro-duction when fitness to environmental conditionsbecomes reduced (Braverman, 1962, 1963;Loomis, 1957; Muller, 1965; Stebbing, 1980)which is reflected by the relative proportion ofsexual polyps and gastrozooids.This paper reports experimental growth datafor a single clone of Clavopsella michaeli undercontrolled laboratory conditions.

From Common to Special: When Multi-Attribute Learning Meets Personalized Opinions,"Visual attributes, which refer to human-labeled semantic annotations, have gained increasing popularity in a wide range of real world applications. Generally, the existing attribute learning methods fall into two categories: one focuses on learning user-specific labels separately for different attributes, while the other one focuses on learning crowd-sourced global labels jointly for multiple attributes. However, both categories ignore the joint effect of the two mentioned factors: the personal diversity with respect to the global consensus; and the intrinsic correlation among multiple attributes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel model to learn user-specific predictors across multiple attributes. In our proposed model, the diversity of personalized opinions and the intrinsic relationship among multiple attributes are unified in a common-to-special manner. To this end, we adopt a three-component decomposition. Specifically, our model integrates a common cognition factor, an attribute-specific bias factor and a user-specific bias factor. Meanwhile Lasso and group Lasso penalties are adopted to leverage efficient feature selection. Furthermore, theoretical analysis is conducted to show that our proposed method could reach reasonable performance. Eventually, the empirical study carried out in this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.",2018,

Variable Selection in General Frailty Models using Penalized H-likelihood,"Variable selection methods using a penalized likelihood have been widely studied in various statistical models. However, in semiparametric frailty models, these methods have been relatively less studied because the marginal likelihood function involves analytically intractable integrals, particularly when modeling multicomponent or correlated frailties. In this article, we propose a simple but unified procedure via a penalized h-likelihood (HL) for variable selection of fixed effects in a general class of semiparametric frailty models, in which random effects may be shared, nested, or correlated. We consider three penalty functions (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO], smoothly clipped absolute deviation [SCAD], and HL) in our variable selection procedure. We show that the proposed method can be easily implemented via a slight modification to existing HL estimation approaches. Simulation studies also show that the procedure using the SCAD or HL penalty performs well. The usefulness of ...",2014,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
Prioritizing genetic variants in GWAS with lasso using permutation-assisted tuning.,"MOTIVATION
Large scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have resulted in the identification of a wide range of genetic variants related to a host of complex traits and disorders. Despite their success, the individual-SNP analysis approach adopted in most current GWAS can be limited in that it is usually biologically simple to elucidate a comprehensive genetic architecture of phenotypes and statistically underpowered due to heavy multiple testing correction burden. On the other hand, multiple-SNP analyses (e.g., gene-based or region-based SNP-set analysis) are usually more powerful to examine the joint effects of a set of SNPs on the phenotype of interest. However, current multiple-SNP approaches can only draw an overall conclusion at the SNP-set level and does not directly inform which SNPs in the SNP-set are driving the overall genotype-phenotype association.


RESULTS
In this paper, we propose a new permutation-assisted tuning procedure in lasso (plasso) to identify phenotype-associated SNPs in a joint multiple-SNP regression model in GWAS. The tuning parameter of lasso determines the amount of shrinkage and is essential to the performance of variable selection. In the proposed plasso procedure, we first generate permutations as pseudo-SNPs that are not associated with the phenotype. Then, the lasso tuning parameter is delicately chosen to separate true signal SNPs and noninformative pseudo-SNPs. We illustrate plasso using simulations to demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods, and application of plasso to a real GWAS data set gains new additional insights into the genetic control of complex traits.

Contributions of advanced techniques to the success and safety of transvenous leads extraction.,"PURPOSE
We measured the proportion of intravascular leads, which can be extracted by simple traction versus with newer techniques, and examined the overall safety and success rate of lead extractions.


METHODS
Between January 2005 and December 2007, 311 consecutive patients (mean age = 70 +/- 14 years, 79% men) underwent extractions of 250 atrial, 318 ventricular, and 22 coronary sinus leads, in the surgical facilities of two experienced medical centers, under general anesthesia, at a mean of 7.2 +/- 5.1 years (range 0.1-27.0) after lead implantation. Infection was the indication for extraction in 67.5% of cases. Complementary techniques were used when simple extraction with a locking stylet was unsuccessful.


RESULTS
Simple traction, with or without a locking stylet, allowed the complete removal in 27.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.1-31.9) of patients. A mechanical sheath, laser sheath, and/or lasso catheter were used in the remaining patients. The overall extraction success rate was 89.7% (95% CI 86.3-93.1). There was one procedure-related death (0.3%; 95% CI 0.0-1.0). Among five other deaths occurring within 10 days after the procedure, four were due to septic shock. Duration of lead implantation was the strongest independent predictor of major adverse events (P = 0.002) and incomplete lead extraction (P = 0.005).


CONCLUSION
In contrast with simple traction, advanced techniques allowed the complete extraction of nearly 90% of leads. In experienced hands and with surgical back-up, these techniques were safe. Patients presenting with infected implanted cardiac devices suffered a high rate of major adverse despite complete extraction of the lead(s).",2009,Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE
Predicting drug-target interaction network using deep learning model,"BACKGROUND
Traditional methods for drug discovery are time-consuming and expensive, so efforts are being made to repurpose existing drugs. To find new ways for drug repurposing, many computational approaches have been proposed to predict drug-target interactions (DTIs). However, due to the high-dimensional nature of the data sets extracted from drugs and targets, traditional machine learning approaches, such as logistic regression analysis, cannot analyze these data sets efficiently. To overcome this issue, we propose LASSO (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)-based regularized linear classification models and a LASSO-DNN (Deep Neural Network) model based on LASSO feature selection to predict DTIs. These methods are demonstrated for repurposing drugs for breast cancer treatment.


METHODS
We collected drug descriptors, protein sequence data from Drugbank and protein domain information from NCBI. Validated DTIs were downloaded from Drugbank. A new similarity-based approach was developed to build the negative DTIs. We proposed multiple LASSO models to integrate different combinations of feature sets to explore the prediction power and predict DTIs. Furthermore, building on the features extracted from the LASSO models with the best performance, we also introduced a LASSO-DNN model to predict DTIs. The performance of our newly proposed DNN model (LASSO-DNN) was compared with the LASSO, standard logistic (SLG) regression, support vector machine (SVM), and standard DNN models.


RESULTS
Experimental results showed that the LASSO-DNN over performed the SLG, LASSO, SVM and standard DNN models. In particular, the LASSO models with protein tripeptide composition (TC) features and domain features were superior to those that contained other protein information, which may imply that TC and domain information could be better representations of proteins. Furthermore, we showed that the top ranked DTIs predicted using the LASSO-DNN model can potentially be used for repurposing existing drugs for breast cancer based on risk gene information.


CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we demonstrated that the efficient representations of drug and target features are key for building learning models for predicting DTIs. The disease-associated risk genes identified from large-scale genomic studies are the potential drug targets, which can be used for drug repurposing.",2019,Computational biology and chemistry
3032 MKit: Pilot Results of Primary Prevention Sexual Violence WebApp,"charged without an operation or patients who had an operation, but nothing was found. The distribution of data samples for prediction task 2 is 37 operation not needed cases and 38 operation of benefit cases. An experienced surgical resident from UPMC manually segmented 3D PI ROIs from the CT scans (5 mm Axial cut) for each case. The most concerning ~10-15 cm segment of bowel for necrosis with a 1 cm margin was selected. A total of 7 slices per patient were segmented for consistency. For both prediction task 1 and prediction task 2, we independently completed the following procedure for testing and training: 1.) Extracted radiomic features from the 3D PI ROIs that resulted in 99 total features. 2.) Used LASSO feature selection to determine the subset of the original 99 features that are most significant for performance of the prediction task. 3.) Used leave-one-out cross-validation for testing and training to account for the small dataset size in our preliminary analysis. Implemented and trained several machine learning models (AdaBoost, SVM, and Naive Bayes). 4.) Evaluated the trained models in terms of AUC and Accuracy and determined the ideal model structure based on these performance metrics. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Prediction Task 1: The top-performing model for this task was an SVM model trained using 19 features. This model had an AUC of 0.79 and an accuracy of 75%. Prediction Task 2: The top-performing model for this task was an SVM model trained using 28 features. This model had an AUC of 0.74 and an accuracy of 64%. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use radiomic-based machine learning models for the prediction of tissue ischemia, specifically intestinal ischemia in the setting of PI. In this preliminary study, which serves as a proof of concept, the performance of our models has demonstrated the potential of machine learning based only on radiomic imaging features to have discriminative power for surgical decision-making problems. While many non-imaging-related clinical factors play a role in the gestalt of clinical decision making when PI presents, we have presented radiomic-basedmodels that may augment this decision-making process, especially for more difficult cases when clinical features indicating acute abdomen are absent. It should be noted that prediction task 2, whether or not a patient presenting with PI would benefit from an operation, has lower performance than prediction task 1 and is also a more challenging task for physicians in real clinical environments. While our results are promising and demonstrate potential, we are currently working to increase our dataset to 300 patients to further train and assess our models.

Quantifying local tumor morphological changes with Jacobian map for prediction of pathologic tumor response to chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancer.,"We proposed a framework to detect and quantify local tumor morphological changes due to chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) using a Jacobian map and to extract quantitative radiomic features from the Jacobian map to predict the pathologic tumor response in locally advanced esophageal cancer patients. In 20 patients who underwent CRT, a multi-resolution BSpline deformable registration was performed to register the follow-up (post-CRT) CT to the baseline CT image. The Jacobian map (J) was computed as the determinant of the gradient of the deformation vector field. The Jacobian map measured the ratio of local tumor volume change where Jâ€‰â€‰<â€‰â€‰1 indicated tumor shrinkage and Jâ€‰â€‰>â€‰â€‰1 denoted expansion. The tumor was manually delineated and corresponding anatomical landmarks were generated on the baseline and follow-up images. Intensity, texture and geometry features were then extracted from the Jacobian map of the tumor to quantify tumor morphological changes. The importance of each Jacobian feature in predicting pathologic tumor response was evaluated by both univariate and multivariate analysis. We constructed a multivariate prediction model by using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier coupled with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for feature selection. The SVM-LASSO model was evaluated using ten-times repeated 10-fold cross-validation (10â€‰â€‰Ã—â€‰â€‰10-fold CV). After registration, the average target registration error was 4.30â€‰â€‰Â±â€‰â€‰1.09â€‰mm (LR:1.63â€‰mm AP:1.59â€‰mm SI:3.05â€‰mm) indicating registration error was within two voxels and close to 4â€‰mm slice thickness. Visually, the Jacobian map showed smoothly-varying local shrinkage and expansion regions in a tumor. Quantitatively, the average median Jacobian was 0.80â€‰â€‰Â±â€‰â€‰0.10 and 1.05â€‰â€‰Â±â€‰â€‰0.15 for responder and non-responder tumors, respectively. These indicated that on average responder tumors had 20% median volume shrinkage while non-responder tumors had 5% median volume expansion. In univariate analysis, the minimum Jacobian (pâ€‰â€‰=â€‰â€‰0.009, AUCâ€‰â€‰=â€‰â€‰0.98) and median Jacobian (pâ€‰â€‰=â€‰â€‰0.004, AUCâ€‰â€‰=â€‰â€‰0.95) were the most significant predictors. The SVM-LASSO model achieved the highest accuracy when these two features were selected (sensitivityâ€‰â€‰=â€‰â€‰94.4%, specificityâ€‰â€‰=â€‰â€‰91.8%, AUCâ€‰â€‰=â€‰â€‰0.94). Novel features extracted from the Jacobian map quantified local tumor morphological changes using only baseline tumor contour without post-treatment tumor segmentation. The SVM-LASSO model using the median Jacobian and minimum Jacobian achieved high accuracy in predicting pathologic tumor response. The Jacobian map showed great potential for longitudinal evaluation of tumor response.",2018,Physics in medicine and biology
Detection of Independent Associations of Plasma Lipidomic Parameters with Insulin Sensitivity Indices Using Data Mining Methodology,"OBJECTIVE
Glucolipotoxicity is a major pathophysiological mechanism in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). We aimed to detect subtle changes in the circulating lipid profile by shotgun lipidomics analyses and to associate them with four different insulin sensitivity indices.


METHODS
The cross-sectional study comprised 90 men with a broad range of insulin sensitivity including normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 33), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n = 32) and newly detected T2D (n = 25). Prior to oral glucose challenge plasma was obtained and quantitatively analyzed for 198 lipid molecular species from 13 different lipid classes including triacylglycerls (TAGs), phosphatidylcholine plasmalogen/ether (PC O-s), sphingomyelins (SMs), and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). To identify a lipidomic signature of individual insulin sensitivity we applied three data mining approaches, namely least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forests (RF) for the following insulin sensitivity indices: homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glucose insulin sensitivity index (GSI), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), and disposition index (DI). The LASSO procedure offers a high prediction accuracy and and an easier interpretability than SVR and RF.


RESULTS
After LASSO selection, the plasma lipidome explained 3% (DI) to maximal 53% (HOMA-IR) variability of the sensitivity indexes. Among the lipid species with the highest positive LASSO regression coefficient were TAG 54:2 (HOMA-IR), PC O- 32:0 (GSI), and SM 40:3:1 (ISI). The highest negative regression coefficient was obtained for LPC 22:5 (HOMA-IR), TAG 51:1 (GSI), and TAG 58:6 (ISI).


CONCLUSION
Although a substantial part of lipid molecular species showed a significant correlation with insulin sensitivity indices we were able to identify a limited number of lipid metabolites of particular importance based on the LASSO approach. These few selected lipids with the closest connection to sensitivity indices may help to further improve disease risk prediction and disease and therapy monitoring.",2016,PLoS ONE
"Litoribacillus peritrichatus gen. nov. sp. nov., isolated from coastal sediment of an amphioxus breeding zone in Qingdao, China","A Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, motile, short rod-shaped bacterium with peritrichous flagella, designated JYr12T, was isolated from sediment of an amphioxus breeding zone in the coastal region of Qingdao, China. Strain JYr12T was found to grow optimally at 28Â Â°C, at pH 7.0 and in the presence of 2â€“3Â % (w/v) NaCl. The organism was determined to contain C16:0 (28.3Â %) and C16:1Ï‰7c and/or C16:1Ï‰6c (34.8Â %) as the major fatty acids and ubiquinone-8 (90Â %) as the predominant isoprenoid ubiquinone. The polar lipids were found to consist of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol and an unknown glycolipid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 42.3Â molÂ %. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain JYr12T was placed in the class Gammaproteobacteria and shared ~91.20, 91.18, 91.01, 90.95, 90.80 and 90.40Â % sequence similarities with representatives of the genus Thalassolituus, Nitrincola, Oceanospirillum, Marinobacterium,Marinomonas and Microbulbifer, respectively. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic data, strain JYr12T is considered to represent a novel species in a new genus within the Gammaproteobacteria, for which the name Litoribacillus peritrichatus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Litoribacillus peritrichatus is JYr12T (=CGMCC 1.10796TÂ =Â JCM17551T).",2012,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek

Morphology of Halophila ovalis ( R . Bi \ ) Hook . / . from Peninsular and East Malaysia,"Halophila ovalis plants were collected from six locations with different habitat characteristics; Merambong, fohore of Peninsular Malaysia (sub-tidal shoal), Teluk Sepinong of Sabah (sub-tidal estuary), Pulau Gaya, Sabah (subtidal degraded coral), Merchang, Terengganu (inter-tidal lagoon), Teluk Kemang, Negeri Sembilan (inter-tidal degraded coral platform) and Punang, Sarawak (inter-tidal beach front). Based on the leaf dimensions (length and width) and number of paired cross-veins, three Halophila ovalis variants can be distinguished; big, intermediate and small-leaved. The big-leaved H. ovalis are found at sub-tidal areas e.g. Merambong, Teluk Sepinong, while intermediate' and small-leaved variants are from inter-tidal areas that are exposed to air for 3 to 4 hours during low tides e.g. Punang, Merchang, Teluk Kemang and Pulau Gaya. The salinity and depth in a particular habitat contribute to the variability in shapes and dimension of leaf sizes. Halophila ovalis leaves showed diverse shapes from ovate, obovate, oblong to spathulate. At deeper depths, turbid water and muddy substrate, leaves of H. ovalis are elongated in shape and with longer petiole length. Halophila ovalis in Malaysia exhibit morphological variability particularly in the leaves in response to the different environmental factors in the various habitats. INTRODUCTION C. serrulata, Halodule uninervis, H. pinifolia, Malaysia has a total of 14 species seagrasses Syringodium isoetifolium, Thalassodendron ciliatum belonging to 8 genera: Enhalus acoroides, Halophila a n d Rupfna maritima (Japar Sidik et al 2001; beccarii, H dedpiens, H. ovalis, H minor, H J a P a r S i d i k a n d M u t a Harah 2003). Amongst spinulosa, Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea rotundata, t h e s e species, H. ovalis exhibits morphology ANNALETCHUMY, L., JAPAR SIDIK, B., MUTA HARAH, Z. & ARSHAD A. variability in response to different environmental factors at various habitats (den Hartog 1970; McMillan et al 1983; Japar Sidik et al 2001). According to den Hartog (1970), H. ovalis is a 'collective species' consisting of a large array of uncertain taxa. Examples of this are subspecies australis (Doty and Stone 1966) den Hartog of South Australia, subspecies bullosa (Setchell) den Hartog of Samoa, Tonga and Fiji, subspecies hawaiiana (Doty and Stone 1966) den Hartog of Hawaii and subspecies linearis (den Hartog) den Hartog of Mozambique. Den Hartog (1970) categorised H ovalis into subspecies based on the leaf sizes and pairs of cross veins. Halophila ovalis has 12-25 pairs of cross veins, while H minor has 4-12 pairs of cross veins. Observations on H. ovalis indicate that they have a wide range of leaf shapes and sizes, pairs of cross veins and pigmentation (Japar Sidik et al 2001; Muta Harah et al 2003). In addition, it was also reported that H. ovalis has long petioles due to heavy sedimentation and large shifts of sand by water movements to obtain maximum sunlight and big leaf blade due to less surface irradiance reaching the bottom of deeper depth, shading or water turbidity reported at Merambong, Johore (Japar Sidik et al 1999; Japar Sidik et al 2001). These are some responses of H ovalis towards the ever changing and unstable environment. Other morphological variabilities related to environmental factors are also reported by various researchers. Halophila ovalis with big leaf blades are found under shaded environment (Duarte 1991), in brackish water (low salinity compared to high salinity in marine waters) (Benjamin et al 1999), low light due to depth (Beer and Waisel 1982; Longstaff and Dennison 1999; Short et al 2001; Ralph 1999) and muddy substrate (Young and Kirkman 1975). Halophila ovalis with small leaves and short petioles are found in habitats with hard carbonate substrate (coralline sand less in free nutrient, Short 1987). Changes in plant morphology and natural habits in H. ovalis that is locally common certainly warrant investigation. This paper reports on the distribution, habitat characteristics and morphology of H ovalis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Halophila ovalis-were collected from six locations, comprising Merambong, Johore (01Â° 19' 00"" N, 103Â° 36' 45"" E), Merchang, Terengganu (05Â° 02' 15.0"" N, 103Â° 17' 53.0"" E), Teluk Kemang, Negeri Sembilan (02Â° 31' 00"" N, 101Â° 47' 00"" E), Teluk Sepinong, Sabah (05Â° 49' 3.42"" N, 118Â° 09' 14.28"" E), Punang, Sarawak (104Â° 54' 23.6"" N, 115Â° 22' 36.3"" E) and Pulau Gaya, Sabah (06Â° 00' 11.0"" N, 116Â° 02' 30.4"" E) (Fig. / ) . At each location, the environmental parameters were recorded, e.g. substrate type, salinity, water temperature and depth. In the laboratory, the collected plants were cleaned of debris and sorted, e.g. vegetative structures comprising the length and diameter of rhizome internode, length and width of leaf blades and petiole length were measured using Mitotoyo Digital Vernier Caliper. Reproductive structures were recorded digitally and measured: male flowerpedicel length, tepal length and width, and anther length and width; female flower-style length, ovary length and width and hypanthium length and length and width of fruit were measured using UTHSCSA Image Tool for Windows software (Wilcox et al 1996). The whole strand of the plants was recorded as digital images by using Nikon CoolPix. The mature leaves were recorded as digital images and pairs of cross veins were counted from the recorded images. The existing plant materials were processed for herbarium specimens as described by Menez et al (1983) and some were preserved as wet specimens in 4% formalin in saline water. Leaf dimension data were analysed for various habitats and compared for differences or similarities by using Cluster Analysis using SPSS Program version 12.0. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Distributions and Habitat Characteristics ofH. ovalis The distribution of H. ovalis is shown in Fig. 1. Details of the habitat characteristics of H ovalis are illustrated in Fig. 2 a g showing; (i) intertidal degraded coral reef platform, e.g. Teluk Kemang (Japar Sidik and Muta Harah 2003; (ii) sub-tidal shoal e.g. Merambong; (iii) intertidal lagoon, e.g. Merchang; (iv) inter-tidal beach front, e.g. Punang; (v) sub-tidal degraded coral reef flat, e.g. Pulau Gaya; and (vi) sub-tidal estuary, e.g. Teluk Sepinong. In the above habitats the waters depth varied from -1.0 to -5.0 m MSL, temperatures between 25-34 C and salinity ranging between 29-31 psu (practical salinity unit). However, at the inter-tidal lagoon of Merchang, salinity fluctuated widely between 9.41-34.41 psu. In addition, H. ovalis plants in Merchang can tolerate a wide fluctuation in PERTANIKAJ. TROP.

Inflammatory bowel disease and patterns of volatile organic compounds in the exhaled breath of children: A case-control study using Ion Molecule Reaction-Mass Spectrometry,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) profoundly affect quality of life and have been gradually increasing in incidence, prevalence and severity in many areas of the world, and in children in particular. Patients with suspected IBD require careful history and clinical examination, while definitive diagnosis relies on endoscopic and histological findings. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the alveolar air of pediatric patients with IBD presents a specific volatile organic compounds' (VOCs) pattern when compared to controls. Patients 10-17 years of age, were divided into four groups: Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), controls with gastrointestinal symptomatology, and surgical controls with no evidence of gastrointestinal problems. Alveolar breath was analyzed by ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry. Four models were built starting from 81 molecules plus the age of subjects as independent variables, adopting a penalizing LASSO logistic regression approach: 1) IBDs vs. controls, finally based on 18 VOCs plus age (sensitivity = 95%, specificity = 69%, AUC = 0.925); 2) CD vs. UC, finally based on 13 VOCs plus age (sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 76%, AUC = 0.934); 3) IBDs vs. gastroenterological controls, finally based on 15 VOCs plus age (sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 65%, AUC = 0.918); 4) IBDs vs. controls, built starting from the 21 directly or indirectly calibrated molecules only, and finally based on 12 VOCs plus age (sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 71%, AUC = 0.888). The molecules identified by the models were carefully studied in relation to the concerned outcomes. This study, with the creation of models based on VOCs profiles, precise instrumentation and advanced statistical methods, can contribute to the development of new non-invasive, fast and relatively inexpensive diagnostic tools, with high sensitivity and specificity. It also represents a crucial step towards gaining further insights on the etiology of IBD through the analysis of specific molecules which are the expression of the particular metabolism that characterizes these patients.",2017,PLoS ONE
Integrated transcriptomic analysis reveals hub genes involved in diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer,"BackgroundThe hunt for the molecular markers with specificity and sensitivity has been a hot area for the tumor treatment. Due to the poor diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC), the excision rate is often low, which makes it more urgent to find the ideal tumor markers.MethodsRobust Rank Aggreg (RRA) methods was firstly applied to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PC tissues and normal tissues from GSE28735, GSE15471, GSE16515, and GSE101448. Among these DEGs, the highly correlated genes were clustered using WGCNA analysis. The co-expression networks and molecular complex detection (MCODE) Cytoscape app were then performed to find the sub-clusters and confirm 35 candidate genes. For these genes, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression model was applied and validated to build a diagnostic risk score model. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used and validated to build a prognostic model.ResultsBased on integrated transcriptomic analysis, we identified a 19 gene module (SYCN, PNLIPRP1, CAP2, GNMT, MAT1A, ABAT, GPT2, ADHFE1, PHGDH, PSAT1, ERP27, PDIA2, MT1H, COMP, COL5A2, FN1, COL1A2, FAP and POSTN) as a specific predictive signature for the diagnosis of PC. Based on the two consideration, accuracy and feasibility, we simplified the diagnostic risk model as a four-gene model: 0.3034*log2(MAT1A)-0.1526*log2(MT1H)â€‰+â€‰0.4645*log2(FN1) -0.2244*log2(FAP), log2(gene count).

Variable Selection Via Penalized Regression,"In this paper, we review the variable-selection properties of LASSO and SCAD in penalized regression. To improve the weakness of SCAD for high noise level, we propose a new penalty function called MSCAD which relaxes the unbiasedness condition of SCAD. In order to compare MSCAD with LASSO and SCAD, comparative studies are performed on simulated datasets and also on a real dataset. The performances of penalized regression methods are compared in terms of relative model error and the estimates of coefficients. The results of experiments show that the performance of MSCAD is between those of LASSO and SCAD as expected.",2005,Communications for Statistical Applications and Methods
Maternal vitamin A status and mother-to-child transmission of HIV in West Africa. DITRAME Study Group.,"Observational studies in Malawi [1] and the United States [2] have shown an association between low plasma vitamin A status during pregnancy and an increased risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. However, this observation was not confirmed in more recent American studies [3,4]. Trials evaluating the efficacy of retinol and carotene supplementation in reducing MTCT have been initiated in Africa. According to the currently available results, vitamin A supplementation does not seem to have any significant effect in reducing MTCT [5,6]. A biased estimation of the effect of vitamin A supplementation, if any, should not be ruled out in those studies. Also, vitamin A deficit in HIV-infected women is multifactorial: intake reduction; impaired release of retinol binding protein (RBP); and excess urinary loss of retinol [7]. These factors could act differently according to the background of endemic vitamin A deficit and the stage of HIV disease. Observations in different settings could therefore be useful to obtain a better understanding of the relationship between vitamin A and MTCT of HIV. 
 
This study was performed within the DITRAME ANRS 049a trial, which was placebo-controlled and evaluated the efficacy of a short regimen of zidovudine (ZDV) in reducing MTCT in breastfed children in Abidjan (Cote dâ€™Ivoire) and Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) [8]. At inclusion in the trial, i.e. at 36â€“38 weeks of gestation, a sample of maternal blood was collected protected from light and serum samples were frozen at âˆ’80Â°C at the CeDReS (Abidjan) and Centre Muraz (Bobo-Dioulasso) laboratories until testing. Samples were shipped for analysis at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Bordeaux (France); retinol by high phase liquid chromatography and RBP by nephelometry. Vitamin A status was evaluated by the retinol level and the retinol : RBP equimolar ratio. Moderate deficit was defined by retinol of less than 30 Î¼g/dl or retinol : RBP of less than 1.3, and severe deficit by retinol of less than 20 Î¼g/dl or retinol : RBP of less than 0.8. Paediatric HIV infection was defined by a positive polymerase chain reaction test at day 180 after birth or earlier. In the present analysis, we considered the cases of paediatric infection up to 90 days after birth. Maternal HIV viral load was assessed by a RNA technique (Bayer-Chiron, Quantiplex 340â„¢, Version 3.0, E. Walpole, MA, USA) with a threshold level of 50 copies/ml. Comparisons of mean maternal vitamin A level and deficit proportions between infected and uninfected children used Studentâ€™s t test and the chi-squared test, respectively. 
 
The collection of samples for vitamin A analysis was initiated in May 1996 in Bobo-Dioulasso and March 1997 in Abidjan. Among the 280 maternal samples expected up to the end of the trial (February 1998), 241 could be analysed for vitamin A status (86%), the rest being inadequately collected or not properly stored. The HIV infection status was known in 234 children, equally distributed between ZDV (118) and placebo (116). At 3 months of life, 54 children (23%) were infected. Levels of retinol, RBP and retinol : RBP were comparable between transmitting and non-transmitting mothers (Table 1). Similarly, the proportions of women with moderate and severe vitamin A deficits were comparable according to the HIV infection status of their children (Table 1). Among the maternal or birth factors studied, only maternal CD4 lymphocytes and viral load at inclusion were significantly and independently associated with MTCT: odds ratios were1.28 (95% confidence interval 1.02â€“1.61) for a decrease of 100 CD4 lymphocytes/mm3 and 5.7 (1.8â€“17.7) for maternal viral load above the median (20 000 copies/ml). These results were not modified when adjusting for the site (Abidjan and Bobo-Dioulasso) and the treatment (ZDV and placebo).

Maternal vitamin A status during pregnancy (36â€“38 weeks of gestation) and paediatric HIV infection at 3 months of life in the DITRAME ANRS 049a trial in Abidjan (Cote dâ€™Ivoire) and Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). 
 
 
 
The observed frequencies of moderate and severe vitamin A deficit based on the serum retinol level in HIV-positive pregnant women were compatible with those of other African studies, one-third of HIV-positive women presenting with moderate deficit [1,6]. However, a statistical relationship between the retinol level and MTCT risk was not found. In the most recently published randomized trial [6], vitamin A supplementation reduced prematurity overall but MTCT was reduced among premature infants only. In the Tanzanian trial [9], vitamin A supplementation alone did not show any benefit for maternal and neonatal indicators, whereas it was the case for supplementation with multiple vitamins. In our study, statistical power could not explain the absence of statistical association between vitamin A deficiency and MTCT because the sample size allowed us a power of 95% to detect a difference of moderate retinol deficit such as 30% among non-transmitting mothers and 60% among transmitters, as in the Malawi cohort [1]. We chose to measure RBP in order to determine whether its depletion could explain retinol deficits and be a marker of advanced HIV disease. No association was found between RBP and the risk of MTCT. Furthermore, the retinol : RBP ratio, which reflects low dietary intakes of retinol and carotene, was also not associated with MTCT. These in-depth biological observations could partly explain the poor benefits obtained in retinol and carotene supplementation trials [6,9]. The mechanisms by which retinol deficit could be modulated in HIV-positive women and therefore supplementation could be efficacious for the reduction of MTCT seem to be complex. Supplementation by itself may thus not provide systematic benefits, especially because the association of maternal vitamin A status and MTCT risk is not universally observed.",2000,AIDS
"Oblique-Slip Sedimentation and Deformation in Nonacho Basin (Early Proterozoic), Northwest Territories, Canada: ABSTRACT","The Nonacho basin shares several traits with molassoid basins formed in oblique-slip settings: (1) great thicknesses (about 9 km, 6 mi) of siliciclastic sediments deposited in alluvial fan, fan-delta, braided stream, beach, deltaic, and lacustrine environments; (2) synsedimentary faults which activated nearby sources; (3) rapid sedimentation and subsidence; (4) telescoped facies transitions, particularly adjacent to active faults; (5) extremely variable thicknesses of lithostratigraphic units; (6) diachronous sedimentation resulting from the migration of source areas and sites of sedimentation along deformation fronts; (7) mobility of deposition and deformation such that early sediments were uplifted, cannibalized, and redeposited; (8) paleocurrents directed basinward nea basin margins, and longitudinally in axial regions; (9) lower greenschist facies metamorphism; (10) paucity of volcanic rocks; and (11) complicated structural geometries. However, these features alone are not diagnostic of oblique-slip origin; all are compatible with rift, aulacogen, impactogen, retroarc, peripheral, intramontane, and broken foreland settings. More reliable indicators of an oblique-slip tectonic setting for the Nonacho basin are: (1) anastomosing pattern of near-vertical, en echelon faults which delineate rhomb-, wedge-, and rectangular-shaped semi-independent subbasins and basement uplifts; (2) stretching lineations of shallow to moderate plunge along shear zones; (3) folds and near-vertical penetrative fabrics, related to shear zones, but at angles of 20Â°-30Â° to these zones. The Nonacho basin fill is interpreted as a foreland molasse of the Trans-Hudson orogene. Deposition and deformation probably occurred in response to convergence accommodated by oblique slip, analogous to the Tarim and Tsaidam basins of China, which developed in the late stages of India-Eurasia collision, north of the Tibetan Plateau.

Weighted Fused Pathway Graphical Lasso for Joint Estimation of Multiple Gene Networks,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are often inferred based on Gaussian graphical models that could identify the conditional dependence among genes by estimating the corresponding precision matrix. Classical Gaussian graphical models are usually designed for single network estimation and ignore existing knowledge such as pathway information. Therefore, they can neither make use of the common information shared by multiple networks, nor can they utilize useful prior information to guide the estimation. In this paper, we propose a new weighted fused pathway graphical lasso (WFPGL) to jointly estimate multiple networks by incorporating prior knowledge derived from known pathways and gene interactions. Based on the assumption that two genes are less likely to be connected if they do not participate together in any pathways, a pathway-based constraint is considered in our model. Moreover, we introduce a weighted fused lasso penalty in our model to take into account prior gene interaction data and common information shared by multiple networks. Our model is optimized based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that our method outperforms other five state-of-the-art graphical models. We then apply our model to two real datasets. Hub genes in our identified state-specific networks show some shared and specific patterns, which indicates the efficiency of our model in revealing the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases.",2019,Frontiers in Genetics
Anomalous midline common ostium of the left and right inferior pulmonary veins: implications for pulmonary vein isolation in atrial fibrillation.,"A 41-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal symptomatic atrial fibrillation refractory to antiarrhythmic drug therapy was referred for pulmonary vein (PV) isolation. Before the procedure, he underwent standard cardiac computed tomographic angiography to evaluate left atrium and PV anatomy, which revealed single right and left superior PVs, each with a moderate-sized ostium. However, the right and left inferior PVs originated from a common and unusually large ostium in the midpostero-inferior left atrium (Figure).

In the vegetation period yield and quality of four sugar beet varieties were assessed under reinfed conditions and in the irrigated plots. Drought caused the decrease both in yield and technical quality of beet roots, mainly due to the accumulation of melassogenic compounds: sodium, Î±-amino N, betaine and inverted sugar. The varieties responded in a similar way to changes in soil water content. There were no interactions between beet genotypes and irrigation in relation to yield or the analyzed constituents. Thus, no genotypic differences were found to exist in the response of sugar beet to water supply.",2004,
Building Energy Use Prediction Owing to Climate Change: A Case Study of a University Campus,"Global warming is expected to increase of 1.5Â°C between 2030 and 2052. This may lead to an increase in building energy consumption. With the changing climate, cities, communities, and university campuses need a more dynamic forecasting model to predict their future energy demands to mitigate risks. Although many building energy prediction models have been developed, only a few have focused on climate change and its impacts. This paper discusses the development of a regression-based forecasting model for a university campus energy use under changing climate. The forecasting model development follows a four-step process: (1) data frame setting, (2) descriptive statistics, (3) statistical regression modeling, and (4) validation and prediction. The independent numeric variables used as inputs are building characteristics (gross square feet, lighting power density, equipment power density; U factor of roof, wall, and windows; building age; years after building renovation; and window-to-wall ratio) and weather data (temperature and humidity). The outputs are electricity and chilled water for 2054. Prior to modeling, matrix plots and histograms are used to identify correlations between variables. This step is followed by normalization of independent variables to check their impact. Finally, multiple linear regression model for electricity and Lasso regression models for chilled water estimations are developed. For the purpose of predicting energy consumption owing to climate change, we used weather data that represents 2054. The equipment power density was the most important factor for electricity consumption and temperature was the most important one for chilled water consumption. The prediction models give an insight of which factors remain essential and applicable to campus building policy to prevent wasting energy in buildings, as a result of climate change.",2019,"Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Workshop on Urban Building Energy Sensing, Controls, Big Data Analysis, and Visualization"
"Abstract A83: Nuclear morphometry differentiates chronic pancreatitis, IPMN, and pancreatic carcinoma","Background: It can be difficult to distinguish between chronic pancreatitis (CP), IPMN, and pancreatic carcinoma (PC) on tissue biopsy. Nuclear morphometry can measure up to 93 unique nuclear features based on standard histopathology. The goal of this work is to build novel, objective, and accurate prediction tools, based on nuclear morphometric signatures in high resolution images of nuclei of histologic sections, for classifying pancreatic tissues into three distinct groups. Materials & Methods: 44 patients who underwent pancreatic resections were identified. 12 cases of CP, 16 cases of IPMN, and 16 cases of PC were utilized in this pilot study. 180 Â± 22 nuclei from each lesion were imaged with high resolution microscopy. Clincodemographic data was obtained retrospectively from the medical record. Statistically significant nuclear features were determined by a fully automated penalized multinomial regression algorithm in order to determine a multi-class classifier and simultaneously identify important nuclear features. The LASSO penalty function, and associated regularization parameter, is adaptively chosen by cross validation to prevent over-fitting. In order to test the veracity of the automated algorithm, we randomly removed 25% of the cases as a training set and utilized the remaining cases as a test set; this was repeated 10 times. Results: The average age was 64 Â± 15 years, with patients in the CP being slightly younger; 63% were male. Median follow-up time was 3 years in the CP group, 3 years in the IPMN group, and 5 years in PC group. The method described automatically identified 6 unique and statistically significant nuclear features (corrected overall P Conclusions: Nuclear morphometry classifies pancreatic lesions into CP, IPMN, and PC with 84.5% accuracy using a fully automated algorithm to determine statistically significant and unique nuclear features. Since the incorrectly classified lesions had a larger proportion of mixed nuclei, diagnostic uncertainty may be determined in a quantitative manner allowing for a confidence probability estimation of whether a given lesions should be classified as a CP, IPMN, or PC. Further studies will validate these results in a resected cohort as well as a cohort based on biopsied specimens alone. Citation Format: Evan S. Glazer, Hao Zhang, Kimberly A.
