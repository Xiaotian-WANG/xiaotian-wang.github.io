On die swell: Some theoretical results,"Abstract Tanner's (1970) theory of capillary die swell is amended, taking account of a suggestion of Graessley, Glassock and Crawley (1970). The calculations for a Maxwell fluid show no significant changes in predictions. The calculations are also carried out for a long annular die, the results being new. An alternative theory based on affine recovery from entry flow for short capillaries is developed. Surprisingly for spherically symmetric sink flow, the predictions are barely distinguishable from the Tanner, or modified Tanner, theories. Comparison with experiment and further discussion are given in a companion paper.",1979,Journal of Non-newtonian Fluid Mechanics
Estimating dynamic brain functional networks using multi-subject fMRI data,"&NA; A common assumption in the study of brain functional connectivity is that the brain network is stationary. However it is increasingly recognized that the brain organization is prone to variations across the scanning session, fueling the need for dynamic connectivity approaches. One of the main challenges in developing such approaches is that the frequency and change points for the brain organization are unknown, with these changes potentially occurring frequently during the scanning session. In order to provide greater power to detect rapid connectivity changes, we propose a fully automated twoâ€stage approach which pools information across multiple subjects to estimate change points in functional connectivity, and subsequently estimates the brain networks within each state phase lying between consecutive change points. The number and positioning of the change points are unknown and learned from the data in the first stage, by modeling a timeâ€dependent connectivity metric under a fused lasso approach. In the second stage, the brain functional network for each state phase is inferred via sparse inverse covariance matrices. We compare the performance of the method with existing dynamic connectivity approaches via extensive simulation studies, and apply the proposed approach to a saccade block task fMRI data.",2018,NeuroImage
Fixation of Regan-Morrey Type II Coronoid Fractures: A Comparison of Screws and Suture Lasso Technique for Resistance to Displacement.,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to compare the load to failure and stiffness achieved in coronoid fractures treated with a posterior-to-anterior screw versus a suture lasso technique.


METHODS
We performed a biomechanical study using 10 pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric elbows. AÂ transverse osteotomy at the midpoint of the coronoid height was created to simulate a Regan-Morrey type II coronoid fracture. The specimens were randomized to screw fixation or suture lasso fixation. The load to failure and stiffness were then measured using a materials testing machine.


RESULTS
Screw fixation provided greater strength and stiffness than suture lasso fixation. Mean load to failure was 405 N in the screw fixation group compared with a load to failure of 207 N for suture fixation. Screw fixation resulted in a mean stiffness of 284 kPa/mm compared with 119 kPa/mm after suture fixation.


CONCLUSIONS
Screw fixation was biomechanically superior to fixation using a suture lasso technique. For coronoid fractures in which screw or suture fixation is feasible, screw fixation may provide greater resistance to displacement of the coronoid compared with a suture lasso technique.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Clinical studies have reported a higher rate of failure after screw fixation compared with suture lasso fixation; however, this study demonstrated a greater stiffness and load to failure after screw fixation of type II coronoid fractures. Screw fixation may provide a stronger fixation construct for fractures of adequate size to support a screw. Further studies may be warranted to assess the importance of securing the anterior capsule to the coronoid tip when using a suture lasso construct because this may affect the stability of the elbow after fixation.",2017,The Journal of hand surgery
Predator density and competition modify the benefits of group formation in a shoaling reef fish,"Synthesis 
 
 
 
Predation risk experienced by individuals living in groups depends on the balance between predator dilution, competition for refuges, and predator interference or synergy. These interactions operate between prey species as well: the benefits of group living decline in the presence of an alternative prey species. We apply a novel model-fitting approach to data from field experiments to distinguish among competing hypotheses about shifts in predator foraging behavior across a range of predator and prey densities. Our study provides novel analytical tools for analyzing predator foraging behavior and offers insight into the processes driving the dynamics of coral reef fish. 
 
 
 
Studies of predator foraging behavior typically focus on single prey species and fixed predator densities, ignoring the potential importance of complexities such as predator dilution; predator-mediated effects of alternative prey; heterospecific competition; or predatorâ€“predator interactions. Neglecting the effects of prey density is particularly problematic for prey species that live in mixed species groups, where the beneficial effects of predator dilution may swamp the negative effects of heterospecific competition. Here we use field experiments to investigate how the mortality rates of a shoaling coral reef fish (a wrasse: Thalassoma amblycephalum), change as a result of variation in: 1) conspecific density, 2) density of a predator (a hawkfish: Paracirrhites arcatus), and 3) presence of an alternative prey species that competes for space (a damselfish: Pomacentrus pavo). We quantify changes in prey mortality rates from the predator's perspective, examining the effects of added predators or a second prey species on the predator's functional response. Our analysis highlights a model-fitting approach that discriminates amongst multiple hypotheses about predator foraging in a community context. Wrasse mortality decreased with increasing conspecific density (i.e. mortality was inversely density-dependent). The addition of a second predator doubled prey mortality rates, without significantly changing attack rate or handling time â€“ i.e. there was no evidence for predator interference. The presence of a second prey species increased wrasse mortality by 95%; we attribute this increase either to short-term apparent competition (predator aggregation) or to a decrease in handling time of the predator (e.g. through decreased wrasse vigilance). In this system, 1) prey benefit from intraspecific group living though a reduced predation risk, and 2) the benefit of group living is reduced in the presence of an alternative prey species.",2013,Oikos
Sparse inverse covariance estimation in Gaussian graphical models,"One of the fundamental tasks in science is to find explainable relationships between observed phenomena. Recent work has addressed this problem by attempting to learn the structure of graphical models especially Gaussian models by the imposition of sparsity constraints. The graphical lasso is a popular method for learning the structure of a Gaussian model. It uses regularisation to impose sparsity. In real-world problems, there may be latent variables that confound the relationships between the observed variables. Ignoring these latents, and imposing sparsity in the space of the visibles, may lead to the pruning of important structural relationships. We address this problem by introducing an expectation maximisation (EM) method for learning a Gaussian model that is sparse in the joint space of visible and latent variables. By extending this to a conditional mixture, we introduce multiple structures, and allow side information to be used to predict which structure is most appropriate for each data point. Finally, we handle non-Gaussian data by extending each sparse latent Gaussian to a Gaussian copula. We train these models on a financial data set; we find the structures to be interpretable, and the new models to perform better than their existing competitors. A potential problem with the mixture model is that it does not require the structure to persist in time, whereas this may be expected in practice. So we construct an inputoutput HMM with sparse Gaussian emissions. But the main result is that, provided the side information is rich enough, the temporal component of the model provides little benefit, and reduces efficiency considerably. The GWishart distribution may be used as the basis for a Bayesian approach to learning a sparse Gaussian. However, sampling from this distribution often limits the efficiency of inference in these models. We make a small change to the state-of-theart block Gibbs sampler to improve its efficiency. We then introduce a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler that is much more efficient than block Gibbs, especially in high dimensions. We use these samplers to compare a Bayesian approach to learning a sparse Gaussian with the (non-Bayesian) graphical lasso. We find that, even when limited to the same time budget, the Bayesian method can perform better. In summary, this thesis introduces practically useful advances in structure learning for Gaussian graphical models and their extensions. The contributions include the addition of latent variables, a non-Gaussian extension, (temporal) conditional mixtures, and methods for efficient inference in a Bayesian formulation.",2014,
Equivalence between adaptive Lasso and generalized ridge estimators in linear regression with orthogonal explanatory variables after optimizing regularization parameters,"In this paper, we deal with a penalized least-squares (PLS) method for a linear regression model with orthogonal explanatory variables. The used penalties are an adaptive Lasso (AL)-type $$\ell _1$$
 penalty (AL penalty) and a generalized ridge (GR)-type $$\ell _2$$
 penalty (GR penalty). Since the estimators obtained by minimizing the PLS methods strongly depend on the regularization parameters, we optimize them by a model selection criterion (MSC) minimization method. The estimators based on the AL penalty and the GR penalty have different properties, and it is universally recognized that these are completely different estimators. However, in this paper, we show an interesting result that the two estimators are exactly equal when the explanatory variables are orthogonal after optimizing the regularization parameters by the MSC minimization method.",2019,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
Die Messen im Tabulaturbuch von Johann Plotz und ihre Verwendung in der Liturgie des evangelischen Gottesdienstes,"According to the specification on the binding of the manuscript, the Tablature Book of Johann Plotz is a â€œMissalâ€, and the majority of its repertoire, recorded in new German organ tablature notation, corresponds to this designation. Based on its paper, the Tablature Book of Johann Plotz can be dated to the turn of the 16th and the 17th century, and its provenance is probably the geographical region of Silesia-SpiÅ¡. The masses recorded here come from the authorial prints of musicians living in the latter half of the 16th century. Side by side, there are masses which originated in a Catholic (Orlando di Lasso, Jacob Handl-Gallus) and in an Evangelical (Johann KnÃ¶fel, Leonhard Lechner, Georg Lange, BartholomÃ¤us Gesius) environment. The adoption of Catholic masses into the liturgy of the Evangelical service was a common practice. The mass cycle was shortened to Kyrie and Gloria (Missa brevis) Ì§ so it could be adjusted to the requirements of the Evangelical service. In its text, the use of the Latin language persisted. In composing masses, the Evangelical musicians followed the liturgical order established by Martin Luther (Deutsche Messe und Ordnung des Gottesdiensts, Wittenberg 1526).",2016,
Adaptive Lasso in high-dimensional settings,"Huang et al. [J. Huang, S. Ma, and C.-H. Zhang, Adaptive Lasso for sparse high-dimensional regression models, Statist. Sinica 18 (2008), pp. 1603â€“1618] have studied the asymptotic properties of the adaptive Lasso estimators in sparse, high-dimensional, linear regression models when the number of covariates may increase with the sample size. They proved that the adaptive Lasso has an oracle property in the sense of Fan and Li [J. Fan and R. Li, Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties, J. Am. Statist. Assoc. 96 (2001), pp. 1348â€“1360] and Fan and Peng [J. Fan and H. Peng, Nonconcave penalized likelihood with a diverging number of parameters, Ann. Statist. 32 (2004), pp. 928â€“961] under appropriate conditions. Particularly, they assumed that the errors of the linear regression model have Gaussian tails. In this paper, we relax this condition and assume that the errors have the finite 2kth moment for an integer k>0. With this assumption, we prove that the adaptive Lasso also has the oracle property under some appropriate conditions. Simulations are carried out to provide understanding of our result.",2009,Journal of Nonparametric Statistics
Signature of survival: a 18F-FDG PET based whole-liver radiomic analysis predicts survival after 90Y-TARE for hepatocellular carcinoma,"Purpose
To generate a predictive whole-liver radiomics scoring system for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing transarterial radioembolization using Yttrium-90 (90Y-TARE) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC).


Results
The generated pPET-RadScores were significantly correlated with survival for PFS (median of 11.4 mo [95% confidence interval CI: 6.3-16.5 mo] in low-risk group [PFS-pPET-RadScore < 0.09] vs. 4.0 mo [95% CI: 2.3-5.7 mo] in high-risk group [PFS-pPET-RadScore > 0.09]; P = 0.0004) and OS (median of 20.3 mo [95% CI: 5.7-35 mo] in low-risk group [OS-pPET-RadScore < 0.11] vs. 7.7 mo [95% CI: 6.0-9.5 mo] in high-risk group [OS-pPET-RadScore > 0.11]; P = 0.007). The multivariate analysis confirmed PFS-pPET-RadScore (P = 0.006) and OS-pPET-RadScore (P = 0.001) as independent negative predictors.


Conclusion
Pretreatment 18F-FDG PET whole-liver radiomics signature appears as an independent negative predictor for PFS and OS in patients undergoing 90Y-TARE for uHCC.


Methods
Pretreatment 18F-FDG PET of 47 consecutive patients undergoing 90Y-TARE for uHCC (31 resin spheres, 16 glass spheres) were retrospectively analyzed. For each patient, based on PET radiomics signature from whole-liver semi-automatic segmentation, PFS and OS predictive PET-radiomics scores (pPET-RadScores) were obtained using LASSO Cox regression. Using X-tile software, the optimal score to predict PFS (PFS-pPET-RadScore) and OS (OS-pPET-RadScore) served as cutoff to separate high and low-risk patients. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The prognostic value of PFS and OS-pPET-RadScore, Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer staging system and serum alpha-fetoprotein level was analyzed to predict PFS and OS in multivariate analysis.",2018,Oncotarget
"Innate Immune Signalling Genetics of Pain, Cognitive Dysfunction and Sickness Symptoms in Cancer Pain Patients Treated with Transdermal Fentanyl","Common adverse symptoms of cancer and chemotherapy are a major health burden; chief among these is pain, with opioids including transdermal fentanyl the mainstay of treatment. Innate immune activation has been implicated generally in pain, opioid analgesia, cognitive dysfunction, and sickness type symptoms reported by cancer patients. We aimed to determine if genetic polymorphisms in neuroimmune activation pathways alter the serum fentanyl concentration-response relationships for pain control, cognitive dysfunction, and other adverse symptoms, in cancer pain patients. Cancer pain patients (468) receiving transdermal fentanyl were genotyped for 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 19 genes: CASP1, BDNF, CRP, LY96, IL6, IL1B, TGFB1, TNF, IL10, IL2, TLR2, TLR4, MYD88, IL6R, OPRM1, ARRB2, COMT, STAT6 and ABCB1. Lasso and backward stepwise generalised linear regression were used to identify non-genetic and genetic predictors, respectively, of pain control (average Brief Pain Inventory < 4), cognitive dysfunction (Mini-Mental State Examination â‰¤ 23), sickness response and opioid adverse event complaint. Serum fentanyl concentrations did not predict between-patient variability in these outcomes, nor did genetic factors predict pain control, sickness response or opioid adverse event complaint. Carriers of the MYD88 rs6853 variant were half as likely to have cognitive dysfunction (11/111) than wild-type patients (69/325), with a relative risk of 0.45 (95% CI: 0.27 to 0.76) when accounting for major non-genetic predictors (age, Karnofsky functional score). This supports the involvement of innate immune signalling in cognitive dysfunction, and identifies MyD88 signalling pathways as a potential focus for predicting and reducing the burden of cognitive dysfunction in cancer pain patients.",2015,PLoS ONE
Decentralised Sparse Multi-Task Regression.,"We consider a sparse multi-task regression framework for fitting a collection of related sparse models. Representing models as nodes in a graph with edges between related models, a framework that fuses lasso regressions with the total variation penalty is investigated. Under a form of restricted eigenvalue assumption, bounds on prediction and squared error are given that depend upon the sparsity of each model and the differences between related models. This assumption relates to the smallest eigenvalue restricted to the intersection of two cone sets of the covariance matrix constructed from each of the agents' covariances. We show that this assumption can be satisfied if the constructed covariance matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property. In the case of a grid topology high-probability bounds are given that match, up to log factors, the no-communication setting of fitting a lasso on each model, divided by the number of agents. A decentralised dual method that exploits a convex-concave formulation of the penalised problem is proposed to fit the models and its effectiveness demonstrated on simulations against the group lasso and variants.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory
A Near Minimax Risk Bound: Adaptive Lasso with Heteroskedastic Data In Instrumental Variable Selection,"In this paper we use adaptive lasso estimator select between relevant and irrelevant instruments in heteroskedastic and non Gaussian data. To do so limit theory of Zou (2006) is extended from univariate iid case. Next, it is shown that adaptive lasso estimator can achieve near minimax risk bound even in the case of heteroskedastic data. To achieve that a new proof is used that benefits from Steinâ€™s Lemma. This is a new result and extends the iid Gaussian case. It is also shown in the paper that Lasso estimators are not model selection consistent whereas adaptive lasso can select the correct model in fixed number of instruments case. The case of weak versus strong instruments are also handled by adaptive lasso. Simulations show that compared to alternatives in econometrics it does well in terms of bias.",2011,
Pileup attenuation for spectroscopic signals using a sparse reconstruction,"In the field of Gamma spectroscopy, the energy spectrum is a histogram of particle energies which is of interest in order to identify an unknown radioactive source. These energies are typically computed as the integral of electrical pulses generated the interaction of Gamma photons with a known semiconductor detector. Due to the finite resolution of the detector, close electrical pulses tend to overlap; this phenomenon, known by the practitioner as pileup effect, yields a severe distortion of the energy spectrum. We present in this contribution a method for pileup attenuation, in order to correct the main distortions caused by the pileup effect. This method can be decomposed in two steps. First, we compute a sparse representation of the signal by means of LASSO in order to estimate the arrival times of each individual electrical pulse and the radioactive source activity. The second step consists in estimating the pulse individual energies by means of another iteration of LASSO, with a smaller value of its sparsity parameter, and plug the obtained values into a standard nonparametric kernel estimator to obtain a corrected energy spectrum. We illustrate the performances of the suggested approach on signals stemming from a High Purity Germanium detector, with a medium activity.",2012,2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel

The results of Classonâ€™s search revealed a striking homology between the antisense of a consensus sequence of Ly6d-L and the hypothetical human homolog of the yeast GTPase activator protein, GYP-7 (accession number AL157464). We did not report this homology as the sequence was deposited after our manuscript was in press; however, the nucleotide sequence we reported has been verified from several clones and does not contain additional nucleotides used by Classon to arrive at the consensus sequence. Classonâ€™s assertion is that our published data must be incorrect and that the cDNA insert is transcribed in the reverse orientation and that mouse GYP-7 translated in our reported experiments. We can state that this is not the case for the following reasons:",2000,Immunity
Essays on human capital interventions in developing countries,"In the first chapter, co-authored with Emanuela Galasso, we evaluate an original large-scale intervention in Madagascar (SEECALINE) that focuses on promoting correct breast-feeding, complementary feeding and hygiene practices. We find that the program helped 0-5 year old children, in the participating communities to bridge their gap in weight-for-age z-score and the incidence of underweight. The program also had significant effects in protecting height-for-age and reducing the incidence of stunting. We also show that SEECALINE can have very different effects on the anthropometric status of children, depending on the educational level of the mother. We find that the program improved height-for-age only for children whose mothers had at least secondary level education. We propose an explanation based on interaction effects between proxies of birth conditions and maternal education. More educated mothers meet the necessary conditions that reinforce the behavioral change enabling program effects. We provide evidence that access to public health facilities during birth and early childhood is necessary for translating behavioral change into improvements in childrenâ€Ÿs health status. 
Chapter 1 leaves the question of differential take-up by maternal education unanswered. The heterogeneous effects could be due to lack of adoption of practices by the least educated mothers. In the second chapter I apply difference-in-difference and propensity score weighting techniques to identify causal impact of the program availability on behavioral change and show that least educated mothers adopted the recommended practices. This complements the evidence presented in chapter 1 that although improved knowledge of child-care may be necessary it is not sufficient to translate into improvements in nutritional outcomes. 
In the third chapter co-authored with Emanuela Galasso and Jeffrey Yau, we estimate the returns to differential lengths of exposure to SEECALINE. We address this question using information available only on program participants. To that end, we develop a methodology that circumvents this data hurdle and estimate returns to differential lengths of exposure using administrative data. We find that the differential returns are decreasing over time, though they do not dissipate to zero. These results provide suggestive evidence that the returns to the program reflect learning effects from the intervention.",2009,
The Inspherical Gergonne Center of a Tetrahedron,"With the traditional deflnition of the Gergonne center of a triangle in mind, it is natural to consider, for a given tetrahedron, the intersection of the cevians that join the vertices to the points where the insphere touches the faces.

Diffusion of green building technologies in new housing construction,"Abstract We analyze the selection of high efficiency windows by builders of new housing units in the United States from 2000 to 2010. Windows are among the five most important technologies impacting energy use in structures. Focusing on windows provides insights into the decisions that result in energy efficient houses and the factors affecting those decisions, which can be muted or completely missed when looking at building ratings or other aggregated estimates. The study analyzes a large data set for the continental United States, applying the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) model selection and cross validation of the training set model with a randomly selected validation data set. Our findings strongly support the importance of climate and energy costs in decisions on energy efficient housing, with important but smaller effects for public policies and incentives. We also find that taxing and insurance policies that increase the overall costs of construction can have negative impacts on the diffusion of energy efficient products.",2015,Energy and Buildings
Assessing the Driverâ€™s Current Level of Working Memory Load with High Density Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy: A Realistic Driving Simulator Study,"Cognitive overload or underload results in a decrease in human performance which may result in fatal incidents while driving. We envision that driver assistive systems which adapt their functionality to the driver's cognitive state could be a promising approach to reduce road accidents due to human errors. This research attempts to predict variations of cognitive working memory load levels in a natural driving scenario with multiple parallel tasks and to reveal predictive brain areas. We used a modified version of the n-back task to induce five different working memory load levels (from 0-back up to 4-back) forcing the participants to continuously update, memorize, and recall the previous 'n' speed sequences and adjust their speed accordingly while they drove for approximately 60 min on a highway with concurrent traffic in a virtual reality driving simulator. We measured brain activation using multichannel whole head, high density functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and predicted working memory load level from the fNIRS data by combining multivariate lasso regression and cross-validation. This allowed us to predict variations in working memory load in a continuous time-resolved manner with mean Pearson correlations between induced and predicted working memory load over 15 participants of 0.61 [standard error (SE) 0.04] and a maximum of 0.8. Restricting the analysis to prefrontal sensors placed over the forehead reduced the mean correlation to 0.38 (SE 0.04), indicating additional information gained through whole head coverage. Moreover, working memory load predictions derived from peripheral heart rate parameters achieved much lower correlations (mean 0.21, SE 0.1). Importantly, whole head fNIRS sampling revealed increasing brain activation in bilateral inferior frontal and bilateral temporo-occipital brain areas with increasing working memory load levels suggesting that these areas are specifically involved in workload-related processing.",2017,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience
"A model for social control of sex change: interactions of behavior, neuropeptides, glucocorticoids, and sex steroids","The optimal regulation of vertebrate sexual development and reproductive function involves integration of internal physiological signals, indicative of an individual's sexual status and capability for reproduction, with signals from the external environment. While these environmental cues are diverse, and oftentimes species-specific, the induction of sexual readiness is typically carried out through the same basic components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis conserved among vertebrates. Therefore, species exhibiting diverse patterns of reproduction can contribute to the understanding of the general mechanisms underlying the expression of adult sexual phenotypes. The bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, is a tropical coral reef fish that displays social control of sex change, whereby dominant males inhibit sex change in other members of the social group using aggressive interactions. In many fish species and vertebrates in general, individuals that lose these interactions often experience increased serum glucocorticoids, which can have a subsequent impact on their physiology and behavior. We discuss glucocorticoid regulation of both neuropeptide gene transcription and the major steroid biosynthetic pathways as potential mechanisms involved in the regulation of sex change in the bluehead wrasse. We present a model describing behavioral regulation of sex change in the bluehead wrasse and then describe the potential mechanistic roles of glucocorticoids, gonadal steroids, and neuropeptides in generating the changes predicted by the model. Through the use of alternative model systems it is possible to observe novel interactions among the neuroendocrine axes that regulate major life history events, like reproduction. These insights may then shed light on similar functional mechanisms underlying behavioral regulation of reproduction in all vertebrates.",2003,Hormones and Behavior
A Natural Language Processing Pipeline of Chinese Free-text Radiology Reports for Liver Cancer Diagnosis,"Background Despite the rapid development of natural language processing (NLP) implementation in electronic medical records (EMRs), Chinese EMRs processing remains challenging due to the limited corpus and specific grammatical characteristics, especially for radiology reports. This study sought to design an NLP pipeline for the direct extraction of clinically relevant features from Chinese radiology reports, which is the first key step in computer-aided radiologic diagnosis. Methods We implemented the NLP pipeline on abdominal computed tomography (CT) radiology reports written in Chinese. The pipeline was comprised of word segmentation, entity annotation, coreference resolution, and relationship extraction to finally derive the symptom features composed of one or more terms. The whole pipeline was based on a lexicon that was constructed manually according to Chinese grammatical characteristics. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and machine learning methods were used to build the classifiers for liver cancer prediction. Random forest model was also used to calculate the Gini impurity for identifying the most important features in liver cancer diagnosis. Results The lexicon finally contained 831 words. The features extracted by the NLP pipeline conformed to the original meaning of the radiology reports. SVM had a higher predictive performance in liver cancer diagnosis (F1 score 90.23%, precision 92.51%, and recall 88.05%). Conclusions Our study was a comprehensive NLP study focusing on Chinese radiology reports and the application of NLP in cancer risk prediction. The proposed method for the radiological feature extraction could be easily implemented in other kinds of Chinese clinical texts and other disease predictive tasks.",2020,ArXiv
Variable selection in model-based clustering and discriminant analysis with a regularization approach,"Several methods for variable selection have been proposed in model-based clustering and classification. These make use of backward or forward procedures to define the roles of the variables. Unfortunately, such stepwise procedures are slow and the resulting algorithms inefficient when analyzing large data sets with many variables. In this paper, we propose an alternative regularization approach for variable selection in model-based clustering and classification. In our approach the variables are first ranked using a lasso-like procedure in order to avoid slow stepwise algorithms. Thus, the variable selection methodology of Maugis et al. (Comput Stat Data Anal 53:3872â€“3882, 2000b) can be efficiently applied to high-dimensional data sets.",2019,Advances in Data Analysis and Classification
Subsampling Winner Algorithm for Feature Selection in Large Regression Data,"Feature selection from a large number of covariates (aka features) in a regression analysis remains a challenge in data science, especially in terms of its potential of scaling to ever-enlarging data and finding a group of scientifically meaningful features. For example, to develop new, responsive drug targets for ovarian cancer, the actual false discovery rate (FDR) of a practical feature selection procedure must also match the target FDR. The popular approach to feature selection, when true features are sparse, is to use a penalized likelihood or a shrinkage estimation, such as a LASSO, SCAD, Elastic Net, or MCP procedure (call them benchmark procedures). We present a different approach using a new subsampling method, called the Subsampling Winner algorithm (SWA). The central idea of SWA is analogous to that used for the selection of US national merit scholars. SWA uses a ""base procedure"" to analyze each of the subsamples, computes the scores of all features according to the performance of each feature from all subsample analyses, obtains the ""semifinalist"" based on the resulting scores, and then determines the ""finalists,"" i.e., the most important features. Due to its subsampling nature, SWA can scale to data of any dimension in principle. The SWA also has the best-controlled actual FDR in comparison with the benchmark procedures and the randomForest, while having a competitive true-feature discovery rate. We also suggest practical add-on strategies to SWA with or without a penalized benchmark procedure to further assure the chance of ""true"" discovery. Our application of SWA to the ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma specimens from the Broad Institute revealed functionally important genes and pathways, which we verified by additional genomics tools. This second-stage investigation is essential in the current discussion of the proper use of P-values.",2020,ArXiv
Network Inference via the Time-Varying Graphical Lasso,"Many important problems can be modeled as a system of interconnected entities, where each entity is recording time-dependent observations or measurements. In order to spot trends, detect anomalies, and interpret the temporal dynamics of such data, it is essential to understand the relationships between the different entities and how these relationships evolve over time. In this paper, we introduce the time-varying graphical lasso (TVGL), a method of inferring time-varying networks from raw time series data. We cast the problem in terms of estimating a sparse time-varying inverse covariance matrix, which reveals a dynamic network of interdependencies between the entities. Since dynamic network inference is a computationally expensive task, we derive a scalable message-passing algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve this problem in an efficient way. We also discuss several extensions, including a streaming algorithm to update the model and incorporate new observations in real time. Finally, we evaluate our TVGL algorithm on both real and synthetic datasets, obtaining interpretable results and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both accuracy and scalability.",2017,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
"Structured Input-Output Lasso, with Application to eQTL Mapping, and a Thresholding Algorithm for Fast Estimation","We consider the problem of learning a high-dimensional multi-task regression model, under sparsity constraints induced by presence of grouping structures on the input covariates and on the output predictors. This problem is primarily motivated by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, of which the goal is to discover genetic variations in the genome (inputs) that influence the expression levels of multiple co-expressed genes (outputs), either epistatically, or pleiotropically, or both. A structured input-output lasso (SIOL) model based on an intricate l1/l2-norm penalty over the regression coefficient matrix is employed to enable discovery of complex sparse input/output relationships; and a highly efficient new optimization algorithm called hierarchical group thresholding (HiGT) is developed to solve the resultant non-differentiable, non-separable, and ultra high-dimensional optimization problem. We show on both simulation and on a yeast eQTL dataset that our model leads to significantly better recovery of the structured sparse relationships between the inputs and the outputs, and our algorithm significantly outperforms other optimization techniques under the same model. Additionally, we propose a novel approach for efficiently and effectively detecting input interactions by exploiting the prior knowledge available from biological experiments.",2012,arXiv: Machine Learning

On Model Selection Consistency of Lasso,"Sparsity or parsimony of statistical models is crucial for their proper interpretations, as in sciences and social sciences. Model selection is a commonly used method to find such models, but usually involves a computationally heavy combinatorial search. Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) is now being used as a computationally feasible alternative to model selection. Therefore it is important to study Lasso for model selection purposes. 
 
In this paper, we prove that a single condition, which we call the Irrepresentable Condition, is almost necessary and sufficient for Lasso to select the true model both in the classical fixed p setting and in the large p setting as the sample size n gets large. Based on these results, sufficient conditions that are verifiable in practice are given to relate to previous works and help applications of Lasso for feature selection and sparse representation. 
 
This Irrepresentable Condition, which depends mainly on the covariance of the predictor variables, states that Lasso selects the true model consistently if and (almost) only if the predictors that are not in the true model are ""irrepresentable"" (in a sense to be clarified) by predictors that are in the true model. Furthermore, simulations are carried out to provide insights and understanding of this result.",2006,J. Mach. Learn. Res.
"Discovery and Predictive Modeling of Urine Microbiome, Metabolite and Cytokine Biomarkers in Hospitalized Patients with Community Acquired Pneumonia","Pneumonia is the leading cause of infectious related death costing 12 billion dollars annually in the United States alone. Despite improvements in clinical care, total mortality remains around 4%, with inpatient mortality reaching 5-10%. For unknown reasons, mortality risk remains high even after hospital discharge and there is a need to identify those patients most at risk. Also of importance, clinical symptoms alone do not distinguish viral from bacterial infection which may delay appropriate treatment and may contribute to short-term and long-term mortality. Biomarkers have the potential to provide point of care diagnosis, identify high-risk patients, and increase our understanding of the biology of disease. However, there have been mixed results on the diagnostic performance of many of the analytes tested to date. Urine represents a largely untapped source for biomarker discovery and is highly accessible. To test this hypothesis, we collected urine from hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and performed a comprehensive screen for urinary tract microbiota signatures, metabolite, and cytokine profiles. CAP patients were diagnosed with influenza or bacterial (S. aureus and S. pneumoniae) etiologies and compared with healthy volunteers. Microbiome signatures showed marked shifts in taxonomic levels in patients with bacterial etiology versus influenza and CAP versus normal. Predictive modeling of 291 microbial and metabolite values achieved a +90% accuracy with LASSO in predicting specific pneumonia etiology. This study demonstrates that urine from patients hospitalized with pneumonia may serve as a reliable and accessible sample to evaluate biomarkers that may diagnose etiology and predict clinical outcomes. Author Summary Urine has been classically considered sterile since most microorganisms are not readily culturable under healthy circumstances. Further, many pneumonia patients are immediately placed on antibiotics rendering culture-based techniques useless. However, the advent of next generation sequencing has enabled unprecedented analysis of the microbial communities â€“ living or detected as free DNA â€“ found in many niches of the human body. Here, we describe a urine microbiome as well as metabolites and cytokines measured in patients newly admitted to the hospital diagnosed with influenza or bacterial (S. aureus and S. pneumoniae) infection pneumonia, compared with healthy controls. Using these parameters alone, we were able to achieve high success in predicting patient pneumonia. This study provides a proof of concept that urine samples, which are easily accessible in outpatient and inpatient settings, could provide additional diagnostic insights to patient infectious status and future risk factor for complication.",2020,bioRxiv
High evolutionary rates and the origin of the Rosso Ammonitico Veronese Formation (Middle-Upper Jurassic of Italy) reptiles,"Abstract The fossil record of metriorhynchids and plesiosaurians from the Rosso Ammonitico Veronese Formation (RAVFm, Middleâ€“Upper Jurassic, Italy) is represented by elements collected between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. All the metriorhynchid material is referred to the genus Neptunidraco. The first RAVFm plesiosaurian material was collected in the nineteenth century and referred to Plesiosaurus: elements are here described and interpreted as a chimerical association of crocodylomorph and plesiosaurian bones, providing the first co-occurrence of these clades in the RAVFm. The second plesiosaurian is the associated skeleton that we refer to Anguanax zignoi gen. et sp. nov. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis confirms the basal geosaurine affinities of Neptunidraco resulted by parsimony analysis. Using both methods, Anguanax was recovered as a basal pliosaurid, sister group of the clade including Marmornectes and Thalassophonea. Bayesian inference methods indicate that both Italian lineages diverged from other known lineages between 176 and 171 Mya, also showing divergence rates significantly higher than any other representative of their respective clades. We suggest a phase of rapid evolutionary adaptation to deeper marine environments in the ancestors of the Rosso Ammonitico Veronese reptiles as a response to the latest Liassic regressive regime in Northern Tethys.",2016,Historical Biology
Asymptotic derivation of a general linear model for thin-walled elastic rodsâ˜†,In this work we derive from three-dimensional elasticity a general mathematically justified theory for thin-walled elastic rods. This theory is obtained as an asymptotic approximation of the three-dimensional linear model as the area and the thickness of the cross-section becomes successively small. It constitutes an extension of the classical Vlassov's theory for thin-walled beams (the most complete among models currently used in engineering).,1997,Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering
Prediction of Cardiovascular Risk in Hemodialysis: a Challenging Healthcare and Machine Learning Problem,"End stage renal disease (ESRD) condition increases the risk of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and sudden death; mortality rates among hemodialysis patients are 20% higher than the general population. Thus in recent years the understanding and proper management of the determinants of cardiovascular disease have become a major focus of nephrology care in order to prevent sudden cardiovascular events (CVEs). 
Aim of this study is to develop forecast models able to predict cardiovascular outcome of patients incidenting (i.e. starting) hemodialysis (HD) treatment. 
Data used in this study was collected in Fresenius Medical Care clinics through the Clinical Management System EuCliD, a system used to handle hemodialysis processes and related information in 626 clinics belonging to 25 countries all over the world since 1999. Data relating to the treatment methods and the physiological condition of patients was collected during the first 12 months of renal replacement therapy and then used to predict the insurgence of CVEs within a 6-month time window. Information regarding 4246 incident hemodialysis patients was extracted and processed. 39 physiological and treatment features were extracted from the temporal series of the variables of interest and used to train predictive models. 
A non-linear Random Forest (RF) predictive model was developed and compared to a Lasso logistic regression model and to a linear kernel SVM model. Every forecast model was tested on 20% of the data. 5-fold cross validation approach was used to validate SVM and RF models. For every patient an estimated probability of having a cardiovascular event was extracted from the random forest with an innovative approach. Every patient was classified in each tree as belonging to the cardiovascular group (patients having a CVE in the next temporal window) or as belonging to the control group (patients not having a cardiovascular event in the next 6 months) and for each patient the mean of the trees votes was used as a probability estimate of cardiovascular risk. ROC curves were built on the probability values obtained using RF model as well as on probability values obtained using linear SVM and logistic regression models. 
Random forest showed higher performance in terms of AUC and ROC values than the other models and sensitivity higher than 73% proving that random forests are able to exploit non-linear patterns retrieved in the feature space. To our knowledge, RF classifier showed a better performance than any other classifier used in previous works in literature for CV risk stratification in ESRD incident patients. 
Moreover out of bag estimates of variable importance in RF and regression coefficients were used to gain insight into the implemented models. It turns out that malnutrition and an inflammatory condition strongly influence cardiovascular outcome in incident HD patients. The results are encouraging and of high importance in nephrology, since a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in the insurgence of cardiovascular events in HD patients can ensure physicians to promptly intervene to prevent a worsening of CV condition.",2013,

High incidence of focal and macro-reentrant arrythmias during repeat procedures after paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation using second-generation cryoballoon with no â€œbonus freezeâ€ application,"Introduction The second-generation cryoballoon (CB2) is effective in achieving pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), however some repeat procedures (RP) were necessary. Purpose Describing clinical arrythmias during radiofrequency-based RP after PVI using CB2. Methods Data from all consecutive patients requiring RP for symptomatic left atrial arrhythmias after PVI using CB2 28Â mm with no â€œbonus freezeâ€ application were analysed. A lasso catheter was used to check pulmonary veinsâ€™ (PV) electrical dissociation and map the clinical arrhythmia with a 3D mapping system, followed by ablation using radiofrequency (RF) energy. Results From January 2014 to December 2016, 31/270 patients (11.5%), mean age 56Â Â±Â 10 years, had RP for paroxysmal AF (24/31; 77.4%), persistent AF (1/31; 3.2%), atypical flutter (4/31; 12.9%) or left atrial tachycardia (2/31; 6.4%) after a median of 8Â Â±Â 8 months following PVI using CB2. Among them, 25 (80.6%) had at least one reconnected PV, but only 46/124 PVs (37.1%) were reconnected. Focal arrythmias was targeted in 12/31 (38.7%) patients, whereas left reentrant arryhthmias were found in 4/31 (12.9%) patients. Cavotricuspid isthmus ablation was performed in 7/31 (22.6%) patients due to induction of typical atrial flutter, typical atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia was induced in one case (3,2%). The superior vena cava was isolated in 5/31 (16.1%) patients. Taking these complementary ablations into consideration, only 17/31 patients (54.8%) had PVI alone during those redo procedures using RF. After a 4-month follow-up, 14/24 (58.3%) patients were free from any symptom or recorded AF, reaching an overall 96.2% success rate after 2 or 3 procedures (only 4 patients). Conclusion Atrial arrythmiasâ€™ recurrence can be related not only to PVsâ€™ reconnection, but also to focal or reentrant atrial arrythmias. It supports the use of 3D-mapping-guided RF ablation for repeat procedures after CB2 ablation.",2018,Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases Supplements
Proposal : Graph Structured Statistical Inference,"This thesis addresses statistical estimation and testing of signals over a grap h when measurements are noisy and high-dimensional. Graph structured patterns appear in applications as di ver e as sensor networks, virology in human networks, congestion in internet routers, and advertising in social netwo rks. We will develop asymptotic guarantees of the performance of statistical estimators and tests, by stating conditions f or consistency by properties of the graph (e.g. graph spectra). The goal of this thesis is to demonstrate theoretica lly that by exploiting the graph structure one can achieve statistical consistency in extremely noisy conditions. We begin with the study of a projection estimator called laplacian eigenmaps , and find that eigenvalue concentration plays a central role in the ability to estimate graph structured patterns. W e continue with the study of the edge lasso, a least squares procedure with total variation penalty, and determine co mbinatorial conditions under which changepoints (edges across which the underlying signal changes) on the graph are recovered. We will shift focus to testing for anomalous activations in the graph, using a scan statistic relaxationand through the construction of a spanning tree wavelet basis . Finally, we study the consistency of kernel density estimation for vertex valued random variables with densities that are Lipschitz with respect to graph metrics.",2012,
Informality and bank stability,"Abstract While financial development (FD) has been widely studied in the literature as a determinant of informal sector size, there has been no focus on the role of financial stability. We find that the stability of the banking sector has a significant and robust negative effect on informality across countries. Using a recently available testing methodology based on a heteroskedasticity-robust Lasso we also find strong support for Rule of Law as a key determinant of informal sector size, and some evidence for the effect of FD.",2019,Economics Letters
Cholesterol-lowering effect of astringent persimmon fruits (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) extracts,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of ethanol extract of astringent persimmon on antioxidant activity, cholesterol, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase activity, and mRNA expression of cholesterol metabolism-related genes in human hepatoma cell line (HepG2 cells). In the results, DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity showed that the different types cultivars of astringent persimmon was similar to Vitamin C as positive control. However, there are not significant differences among samples. In addition, our results showed that cholesterol amounts and HMG-CoA reductase activity were inhibited by astringent persimmon in HepG2 cells. Further, treatment with astringent persimmon upregulated the expression of LDL receptor and SREBP-2, and also increased the level of HDL-associated ABCA1. Taken together, our results indicate that astringent persimmon regulate cholesterol accumulation by inhibiting the oxidative stress and controlling the levels of LDL & HDLassociated gene.",2017,Food Science and Biotechnology
Separating and Recognizing Gestural Strokes for Sketch-Based Interfaces,"Gestures are widely used as shortcuts to invoke commands in pen-enabled systems. The pen mode problem needs to be addressed when integrating gestures into sketching applications. Traditionally, explicit mode switching methods are widely employed to separate gestural strokes from normal inking strokes. However, explicit methods may have availability constraints or be inefficient under many circumstances. In this work, a new gesture interaction paradigm for sketch-based interfaces was proposed. The lasso stroke, which is widely used for selection, was modified and used to indicate the entrance of gesture mode. Our approach is intuitive and efficient; it could be a useful addition to pen-based user interfaces.",2014,
Language at the Elementary School.,"While numerous studies on bilingual education have looked at student test scores, drop-out rates, and parental responses, this study looks at the attitudes of the students directly affected by bilingual education. Interviews with a representative sample of 132 elementary school students (grades 4-6) in El Paso, Texas were conducted for this study. Investigating the behaviors and attitudes of children with respect to language use should provide insight into changing linguistic norms of this border community. Questions were designed to elicit students' attitudes toward Spanish and English as well as determine-their public and private use of these languages for a variety of purposes and contexts, in addition to eliciting information concerning their sociodemographic and academic background. The bulk of this paper consists of reporting the statistical details of how the students answered numerous questions about their language use preferences, level of proficiency, and feelings about the Spanish language.

Note for Alan â€™ s Class,"Wavelets have proven to be immensely useful for signal analysis and representation [7]. Various dictionaries of wavelets have been designed for different types of signals or function spaces [3, 13]. Two key factors underlying the successes of wavelets are the sparsity of the representation and the efficiency of the analysis. Specifically, a signal can typically be represented by a linear superposition of a small number of wavelet elements selected from an appropriate dictionary. The selection can be accomplished by efficient algorithms such as matching pursuit [10] and basis pursuit [4]. From a linear regression perspective, a signal can be considered a response variable, and the wavelet elements in the dictionary can be considered the predictor variables or regressors. The number of elements in a dictionary can often be much greater than the dimensionality of the signal, so this is the so-called â€œp > nâ€ problem. The selection of the wavelet elements is the variable selection problem in linear regression. The matching pursuit algorithm [10] is the forward selection method, and the basis pursuit [4] is the lasso method [14].",2009,
Sleep quality and nocturnal pain in patients with femoroacetabular impingement and acetabular dysplasia,"Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome and acetabular dysplasia (AD) are common pathologies that lead to pain in the young adult hip. Nocturnal pain in these patients is often reported, yet little is known regarding the effect of these hip pathologies on overall sleep quality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate sleep quality in patients with AD and FAI syndrome. This cross-sectional study consisted of 115 patients who complained of hip pain secondary to either FAI syndrome or AD. One hundred fifteen patients with hip pain secondary to FAI syndrome and AD were assessed using the Hip Outcome Score (HOS), Modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), and then Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS). Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Multiple linear regression, with adaptive LASSO variable selection, was used to assess factors associated with sleep quality. Of the 115 patients, 62 had a diagnosis of FAI syndrome and 53 with AD. The mean age was 34.55â€‰Â±â€‰11.66 (age range: 14 to 58â€‰years), 76.52% had an ASA classification of 1 (ASA range: 1 to 3), and all Tonnis grades were either 0 or 1. The mean PSQI global score for all patients was 8.46â€‰Â±â€‰4.35 (PSQI range: 0 to 21), indicating poor sleep quality. The adaptive LASSO-penalized least squares multiple linear regression revealed that HOOS Pain, SF-12 Role Emotional, and SF-12 Mental Health significantly predicted Sleep Quality (Adjusted R2â€‰=â€‰0.4041). Sleep quality improved as pain, emotional problems, and mental health improved. Patients with symptomatic FAI syndrome and AD have poor sleep quality. Worsening pain from a patientâ€™s hip pathology is associated with poor sleep, even prior to the onset of osteoarthrosis of the hip. Patients presenting with hip pain from FAI syndrome and AD should be screened for sleep disturbance and may benefit from a multidisciplinary treatment approach.",2020,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders
A partial least squares-based stimulus frequency recognition model for steady-state visual evoked potentials detection,"With shorter calibration times and higher information transfer rates, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been studied most activity in recent years. Target identification is the ongoing core task in BCI researches, and plays a significant role in practical applications. In order to improve the performance of SSVEP-based BCI system, we proposed a partial least squares (PLS)-based stimulus frequency recognition model for SSVEP detection. Moreover, we compared the proposed method with canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, respectively. The experiment results showed that PLS can not only extract the SSVEP features effectively, but also can increase the classification accuracies of SSVEP-based BCI systems.",2014,2014 7th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics
Iteratively Reweighted $\ell_1$ Approaches to $\ell_2$-Constrained Sparse Composite Regularization,"Motivated by the observation that a given signalx admits sparse representations in multiple dictionariesÎ¨d but with varying levels of sparsity across dictionaries, we propose two new algorithms for the reconstruction of (approximately) sparse signals from noisy linear measurements. Our first alg orithm, Co-L1, extends the well-known lasso algorithm from the L1 regularizer â€–Î¨xâ€–1 to composite regularizers of the form âˆ‘ d Î»dâ€–Î¨dxâ€–1 while self-adjusting the regularization weights Î»d. Our second algorithm, Co-IRW-L1, extends the well-known iteratively reweighted L1 algorithm to the same family of composite regularizers. We provide several interpretations of both algorithms: i) majorization-minimization (MM) appli ed to a non-convex log-sum-type penalty, ii) MM applied to an approximate l0-type penalty, iii) MM applied to Bayesian MAP inference under a particular hierarchical prior, and iv) va riational expectation-maximization (VEM) under a particular prior with deterministic unknown parameters. A detailed numerical study suggests that our proposed algorithms yield significa ntly improved recovery SNR when compared to their non-composite L1 and IRW-L1 counterparts. I. I NTRODUCTION We consider the problem of recovering the signal (or image) x âˆˆ C from noisy linear measurements of the form y = Î¦x+w âˆˆ C , (1) whereÎ¦ âˆˆ C is a known measurement operator and w âˆˆ C is additive noise. We are particularly interested in the case thatM â‰ª N , where x cannot be uniquely determined from the measurements y, even in the absence of noise. Such problems arise in imaging, communications, speech, radar, machine learning, and many other applicatio ns, and are sometimes collectively referred to as compressive sensing(CS) [1,2]. A. l2-Constrained Regularization By incorporating (partial) prior knowledge about the signa l and noise power, it may be possible to accurately recover x from M â‰ª N measurementsy. In this work, we consider signal recovery based on optimization problems of the form argmin x R(x) s.t. â€–y âˆ’Î¦xâ€–2 â‰¤ Î´, (2) The authors are with the Department of Electrical and Comput er Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. âˆ— Please direct all correspondence to Prof. Philip Schniter, Dept.

We briefly summarize several common instances of R(x) below. 1) If x is known to besparse(i.e., contains sufficiently few non-zero coefficients) or approximately sparse, then one would ideally like to use thel0 penalty (i.e., counting â€œnormâ€) R(x) = â€–xâ€–0 , âˆ‘N n=1 1|xn|>0, where1{Â·} is the indicator function. However, since this choice makes (2) NP-hard, it is not often used in practice. 2) The l1 penalty,R(x) = â€–xâ€–1 = âˆ‘N n=1 |xn|, is a wellknown surrogate to the l0 penalty that renders (2) convex, and thus amenable to polynomial-time solution. In this case, (2) is known as basis pursuit denoising[4] or the lasso[5], which is commonly used insynthesis-based CS [1,2]. 3) Iteratively reweightedl1 minimization (IRW-L1) [6] solves (2) repeatedly under R(x) = âˆ‘N n=1 w (t) n |xn|, with the iterationt weightw n =(Ç« + |x n |)âˆ’1 computed from the previous estimate x n and smallÇ« â‰¥ 0. Various empirical and theoretical studies have shown that IRW-L1 performance surpasses that of standard l1 [6]â€“ [8]. The IRW-L11 algorithm can be interpreted [6] as a majorization-minimization (MM) [9] approach to (2) under thelog-sumpenaltyR(x) = âˆ‘N n=1 log(Ç« + |xn|), which can be considered as a non-convex surrogate to the l0 penalty. 4) The choiceR(x) = â€–Î¨xâ€–1, with known matrixÎ¨ âˆˆ C , leads toanalysis-basedCS [10] and thegeneralized lasso[11]. Penalties of this form are appropriate when prior knowledge suggests that the transform coefficients Î¨x are (approximately) sparse, as opposed to the signalx itself being sparse. WhenÎ¨ is a finitedifference operator, â€–Î¨xâ€–1 is known astotal variation regularization [12]. 5) The IRW-L1 algorithm can also be applied to analysisCS by iteratively solving (2) underR(x) = âˆ‘L l=1 w (t) l |Ïˆ T l x|, wherew (t) n = (Ç« + |Ïˆl x(tâˆ’1)|)âˆ’1 and Ïˆ T l is the lth row of Î¨ [6]. Of course, many other penalties R(x) have been considered in the literature, such as R(x) = â€–Î¨xâ€–p with p > 0. In this latter case, the choice of p âˆˆ (0, 1) promotes sparsity inx but yields a non-convex penalty [13]â€“[15], the choice p = 2 yields the well-known case of Tikhonov regularization [16] , and the choicep =âˆž promotes anti-sparsity inx [17]. 1Iteratively reweightedl2 algorithms have also been formulated to minimize the log-sum penalty [7].",2015,
A new random subspace method incorporating sentiment and textual information for financial distress prediction,"Abstract Financial distress prediction aims to provide the early warning signals for corporate governance, which has been widely recognized as a promising way to reduce financial losses. However, non-financial predictive information, such as sentiment and textual information, and the class-imbalance problem were often neglected in previous research. Therefore, incorporating sentiment and textual information into a random subspace method (IST-RS), is proposed for financial distress prediction. Sentiment and textual features are extracted as non-financial features and further integrated with the conventional financial features. To deal with the high-dimension and class-imbalance problems, the ensemble random subspace method is adopted and improved by fusing the lasso regularized sparse method. Experiments on the dataset derived from the China Security Market Accounting Research Database (CSMAR) were conducted to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of IST-RS. The results indicate that the proposed approach enables the performance of financial distress prediction to be significantly improved. Moreover, the proposed approach has outperformed the benchmark methods on high-dimensional datasets, which demonstrates that is suitable for simultaneously solving the high-dimensionality and class-imbalance problems in financial distress prediction.",2018,Electron.

Self-Assembly of Catenanes from Lasso Peptides.,"Lasso peptides exist naturally in a threaded state as [1]rotaxanes, and we reasoned that lasso peptides cleaved in their loop region could serve as building blocks for catenanes. Mutagenesis of the lasso peptide microcin J25 (MccJ25) with two cysteine residues followed by cleavage of the peptide with trypsin led to a [2]rotaxane structure that self-assembled into a [3]catenane and [4]catenanes at room temperature in aqueous solution. The [3]catenane represents the smallest ring size of a catenane composed solely of polypeptide segments. The NMR structure of the [3]catenane was determined, suggesting that burial of hydrophobic residues may be a driving force for assembly of the catenane structure.",2016,Journal of the American Chemical Society
An Efficient Genome-Wide Multilocus Epistasis Search.,"There has been a continuing interest in approaches that analyze pairwise locus-by-locus (epistasis) interactions using multilocus association models in genome-wide data sets. In this paper, we suggest an approach that uses sure independence screening to first lower the dimension of the problem by considering the marginal importance of each interaction term within the huge loop. Subsequent multilocus association steps are executed using an extended Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model and fast generalized expectation-maximization estimation algorithms. The potential of this approach is illustrated and compared with PLINK software using data examples where phenotypes have been simulated conditionally on marker data from the Quantitative Trait Loci Mapping and Marker Assisted Selection (QTLMAS) Workshop 2008 and real pig data sets.",2015,Genetics
Utilisation inappropriÃ©e des mÃ©dicaments chez des personnes Ã¢gÃ©es avec des multimorbiditÃ©s : traceur utile pour lâ€™analyse du systÃ¨me de soins au Burkina Faso,"Inappropriate use of medication which occurs from the care of the persons with multimorbidity is recognized as a public health issue for the northern countries. This is stressed by the ageing of their population. In sub-Saharan Africa and more specifically in Burkina Faso, the care of the people with multimorbidity, in particular at the older adults, still seems little taken into account in the health care systems organization. This system is still health problems-centered and acute diseases- centered. The aim of this thesis was to analysis the health care system by a tracer Â«Inappropriate use of medication in older adults with multimorbidityÂ». The three questions of research were 1) what are the characteristics of the older adults with multimorbidity which could influence the inappropriate use of medication? 2) What are the characteristics of the health care system which influence the care of older adults with multimorbidity? 3) How the characteristics of health care system influence the care of older adults with multimorbidity? The research was carried out at Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso. We conducted an analysis based-system centered on the care of older adults with multimorbidity. For their care, the older adults are in interaction with the care providers, the organization of health facilities and the social-family network. This system was analyzed through different methods using various sources of data. This analysis had for starting point the older adults at home. This first step was carried out in 2012. This first step consisted of a household survey to understand health problems (chronic diseases) and the problems of the older adults care (potentially inappropriate medication). In a second step (2013-2014), we carried out, in a logical way, sub-studies in the health facilities 1) the health care system dysfunctions, 2) the factors of heath care organization associated with the inappropriate use of medication according to the older adultâ€™s perspective and 3) the reasons of the inappropriate use of medication during the care of older adults. Our sample was constituted by older adults with a mean age of 69 years. Among the older adults, 55.3% were men, 54.1% illiteracy 58.7%, married, 58% without retirement incomes and 59.1% having already used a health facility during the last six months. We found older adults with polypharmacy (39%), multimorbidity (65 %), having used at least one inappropriate medication (59%), having used the formal and informal care (self-medication by informal market, the traditional medication) for the same episode of disease. These older adults were affected by the following main chronic diseases: arterial hypertension (82.3%), malnutrition (39.2%), visual impairment (28.3%), and diabetes mellitus (26.5%). About their care, our research showed an acute management of the chronic diseases, a lack of coordination with others care providers in the private and traditional sector, a weak implementation of the activities of information, educational and communication to strengthen patients empowerment, a weakness in the in-house training of the care providers, an insufficiency of the teamwork, a lack of standards and protocols for the care of the older adults with multimorbidity. The main prescribers of inappropriate medication were the paramedical in the first line. The characteristics of care providers who can contribute to explain the use of the inappropriate medication are: their missing work, their initial training, the lack of their work follow-up (assessment), their relation with the older adult during the consultation (paternalist), their low feeling of non-accountability to the patients and to their peers. To improve the use of inappropriate medication at the older adults with multimorbidity, we propose track at various levels and by priority, which should bring a profit beyond this target group. At macro level, the current dynamic in Burkina Faso about the development of an universal health insurance (UHI) and as well as the discussions about the financing based-result (FBR) could be taken as opportunities. In the first place, the identification of a basket of care for the UHI is an opportunity to include the necessary services for the rational care of the older adults with multimorbidity. Secondly, the inclusion of the private care providers in the system of UHI could allow the improvement of the health care system compartmentalization. Thirdly, the opportunity offered by the UHI and the FBR to include private and public care providers in the care is a track to introduce a process of accreditation for these providers in the rational prescription. Fourthly, to support this rational care, the implementation of consensus experts' committee could allow the producing of pharmaceutical and therapeutic directives centered on the care of the older adults with multimorbidity. This committee can be constituted by the experts of the learned societies and by the general practitioners of hospitals. At meso level: in the first place, a committee of regional experts constituted by specialists and general practitioners of hospitals can design therapeutic and pharmaceutical protocols and insure their application for the care of older adults with multimorbidity. This committee offers an opportunity to work on the conception of a medical record in hospitals. Secondly, the implementation of this committee is an opportunity to ensure the in-house training of the care providers. This in-house training could join the logic of the accreditation of the care providers in the rational prescription. At micro level: in the first place, the implementation of the pharmaceutical and therapeutic committees in the district hospitals could allow a rational prescription for the older adults with multimorbidity. These committees can consist of doctors, pharmacists, nurses and of social workers. Secondly, these committees can promote the use of the therapeutic and pharmaceutical protocols, the test of a medical shared tool (medical record). Thirdly these committees can be an opportunity to develop a local multidisciplinary team of care, to think about forms of information, educational and communication to strengthen patientâ€™s empowerment and to define the role of a home-care coordinator.",2015,
Characteristics and associated factors of physical activity-related injuries among university students in southern China,"This cross-sectional study aimed to describe the characteristics of physical activity-related injury (PARI) and to explore its associated factors among university students in Chaoshan district. Selected from the baseline survey in March and April, 434 students graded 1â€“3 from two universities were interviewed face-to-face in April and May 2017. Socio-demographics, physical activity (PA) participation, risk-taking behaviors, and PARI occurrences in the past 12 months were collected. Group Lasso logistic regression was applied to identify the risk factors of PARI. Totally, 317 PARI episodes were reported by 184 subjects with an overall injury risk of 0.73 injuries/student/year (males: 1.00, females: 0.63) and an injury incidence density of 0.81 injuries per 1000 PA exposure hours (males: 1.13, females: 0.69). Most injuries involved the lower extremities and were sprains and strains. Males, sports team members, and those with high-risk rebellious and anti-social behaviors were more likely to sustain PARI compared to their counterparts. Those who participated in vigorous-intensity PA with longer duration (particularlyâ€‰â‰¥â€‰150â€‰min/week) were at a higher risk for PARI. This study indicates that PARI is a health concern among university students and great efforts should be taken to prevent them from PARI when promoting a physically active lifestyle.",2020,Scientific Reports
Esicm Lives 2018,"INTRODUCTION. Pulmonary aspiration syndrome is the principal cause of ARDS and nosocomial pneumonia, which increase hospital morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Previous attempts to identify the risk factors for overt nosocomial aspiration were not systematic. OBJECTIVES. To derive and validate comprehensive prediction model for overt nosocomial pulmonary aspiration. We hypothesized that such prediction model will show adequate discrimination and calibration in historical patient cohorts. METHODS. A retrospective case-control study of consecutive adults admitted to Mayo Clinic hospital in Rochester, MN from 2006 through 2015. Nosocomial aspiration was defined using a novel electronic medical record-based diagnostic algorithm (termed â€œaspiration snifferâ€) based on natural language processing of clinical notes. The patients who screened positive for aspiration and who were either in the ICU within 48 hours before aspiration or required ICU care within 48 hours after aspiration, were enrolled and split into the derivation and the validation cohorts. An equal number of controls were selected from among those who screened negative for aspiration, matching for age, sex, and year of hospitalization. A blinded manual chart review was performed on a random sample to assess the sniffer's accuracy for aspiration/non-aspiration. Predictor variables included a comprehensive list of demographic characteristics, comorbidities, prognostic scores (Charlson, SOFA, APACHE), and clinical variables (all present or have occurred before aspiration). We performed LASSO regression analysis to select the variables for the model. All variables with P< 0.15 contributed to the final multivariable conditional logistic regression model. The model's discrimination was assessed with the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS. Out of 45,115 patients, 917 fulfilled the aspiration enrollment criteria and after adding matched controls were split into the derivation (458 pairs) and validation (459 pairs) datasets. The random-sample manual chart review showed 100% accuracy of the sniffer-based aspiration/non-aspiration assignment. Variables selected for the final model are presented in Table 1. This aspiration prediction model showed very good discrimination. The concordance statistic using the point score for the derivation and validation models were 0.777 (95% CI 0.74, 0.82) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.74, 0.82). Using the best discrimination cutoff of 4.5, sensitivity and specificity were 71.2/72.3 and 72.5/69.9 in the derivation/validation models, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. We derived and validated electronic prediction model for overt nosocomial pulmonary aspiration, programmable for automated identification of hospitalized patients' at risk, in whom potential prevention strategies can be developed and tested.",2018,Intensive Care Medicine Experimental
Event-related Potential analysis using elastic net logistic regression,"The objective of the thesis is to explore whether regularization techniques can be applied to ERP analysis, and which type of regularization is adequate. This thesis proposes elastic net regularization logistic regression as a good candidate of data analytic method for Event-Related Potential analysis (ERP). Specifically, regularization techniques are used to identify latency in ERP. Study 1 tested whether regularization logistic regression can classify latency using simulated ERP data. It showed that ridge and lasso could identify latency information. In study 2, the same analyses were applied to actual ERP data. Ridge regression can identify latency information wheras lasso cannot.",2016,

Variaciones sobre un episodio de la ""Eneida"" en la Ã©pica cortesiana del Quinientos","Among the literary models that, in fifteenth-century epics on the conquest of Mexico, help to set into epic form the historical matter taken from the chronicles, Virgilâ€™s Aeneid plays a fundamental role. This paper is aimed at showing how the identification between Jeronimo de Aguilar and the Virgilian Achaemenides, found for the first time in Luis Zapataâ€™s Carlo famoso , reappears in Francisco de Terrazas, Gabriel Lobo Lasso de la Vega and Antonio de Saavedra Guzman, as well as at proposing some considerations on possible links between their works.",2016,
An algorithm for the estimation of regularization paths of generalized linear models with group LASSO penalty,"Computing the regularization paths of generalized linear models (GLM) with group LASSO penalty can be decomposed into two problems: Selecting the path parameter and computing group LASSO solution ???1705-01??? (Î») given Î». In practice, grid method is usually used to solve the first one and coordinate descent algorithm based on the first order Taylor expansion of loss function of GLM is then used to solve the second. This paper aims at proposing algorithms that solve these two problems more efficiently. Firstly, we give a path following algorithm that attempts to find the Î»s that correspond to the change of active set. Secondly, we take advantage of the properties of GLM, and use second-order, instead of first-order, Taylor approximation of the loss function of GLM in coordinate descent method to achieve better precision in less time. Simulated and real data sets show that our algorithm is capable of efficiently pinpointing the critical Î»s that pair with changes of active set and that our proposed coordinate descent algorithm based on second-order approximation is competitive in speed compared with that based on second-order approximation.",2015,
"Visualizing large-scale RDF data using Subsets, Summaries, and Sampling in Oracle","The paper addresses the problem of visualizing large scale RDF data via a 3-S approach, namely, by using, 1) Subsets: to present only relevant data for visualisation; both static and dynamic subsets can be specified, 2) Summaries: to capture the essence of RDF data being viewed; summarized data can be expanded on demand thereby allowing users to create hybrid (summary-detail) fisheye views of RDF data, and 3) Sampling: to further optimize visualization of large-scale data where a representative sample suffices. The visualization scheme works with both asserted and inferred triples (generated using RDF(S) and OWL semantics). This scheme is implemented in Oracle by developing a plug-in for the Cytoscape graph visualization tool, which uses functions defined in a Oracle PL/SQL package, to provide fast and optimized access to Oracle Semantic Store containing RDF data. Interactive visualization of a synthesized RDF data set (LUBM 1 million triples), two native RDF datasets (Wikipedia 47 million triples and UniProt 700 million triples), and an OWL ontology (eClassOwl with a large class hierarchy including over 25,000 OWL classes, 5,000 properties, and 400,000 class-properties) demonstrates the effectiveness of our visualization scheme.",2010,2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2010)
"Marine reptiles from the Jurassic/Cretaceous transition at the High Andes, Mendoza, Argentina","Abstract Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous deposits of the Vaca Muerta Formation (Neuquen Basin, central-west Argentina) have yielded abundant marine reptile remains. Most of them correspond to faunal assemblages recovered from outcrops in the Neuquen Province (Argentina). Herein we report two new marine reptile-bearing localities documenting the Tithonianâ€“Berriasian transition at the High Andes (Mendoza Province, Argentina). Marine reptiles have been mapped and/or collected in connection with an accurate ammonoid-based biostratigraphic control. All the skeletons have been found preserved in, or associated with, calcareous nodules. At both localities they are frequent in beds assigned to the upper Tithonian Corongoceras alternans ammonite Zone (Microcanthum to â€œDurangitesâ€ Standard Zones), and are rare to common in beds assigned to the upper Tithonianâ€“lower Berriasian Substeueroceras koeneni Zone (â€œDurangitesâ€ to Jacobi Standard Zones). Newly discovered assemblages depict a similar pattern characterized by the lack of plesiosaurs (plesiosauroids and pliosaurids), and by the abundance of mesoconsumers represented by ophthalmosaurids and metriorhynchine metriorhynchids. Macropredator geosaurines, apex metriorhynchids predators, and thalassochelydian turtles are rare components of these assemblages.",2019,Journal of South American Earth Sciences
Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks with Sparse Structural Equation Models Exploiting Genetic Perturbations,"Integrating genetic perturbations with gene expression data not only improves accuracy of regulatory network topology inference, but also enables learning of causal regulatory relations between genes. Although a number of methods have been developed to integrate both types of data, the desiderata of efficient and powerful algorithms still remains. In this paper, sparse structural equation models (SEMs) are employed to integrate both gene expression data and cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL), for modeling gene regulatory networks in accordance with biological evidence about genes regulating or being regulated by a small number of genes. A systematic inference method named sparsity-aware maximum likelihood (SML) is developed for SEM estimation. Using simulated directed acyclic or cyclic networks, the SML performance is compared with that of two state-of-the-art algorithms: the adaptive Lasso (AL) based scheme, and the QTL-directed dependency graph (QDG) method. Computer simulations demonstrate that the novel SML algorithm offers significantly better performance than the AL-based and QDG algorithms across all sample sizes from 100 to 1,000, in terms of detection power and false discovery rate, in all the cases tested that include acyclic or cyclic networks of 10, 30 and 300 genes. The SML method is further applied to infer a network of 39 human genes that are related to the immune function and are chosen to have a reliable eQTL per gene. The resulting network consists of 9 genes and 13 edges. Most of the edges represent interactions reasonably expected from experimental evidence, while the remaining may just indicate the emergence of new interactions. The sparse SEM and efficient SML algorithm provide an effective means of exploiting both gene expression and perturbation data to infer gene regulatory networks. An open-source computer program implementing the SML algorithm is freely available upon request.",2013,PLoS Computational Biology
Thermoregulation in Antarctic fulmarine petrels,"Abstract We measured resting metabolic rates at air temperatures between ca. âˆ’5 and 30â€‰Â°C in snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea), cape petrels (Daption capense), Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica), and Antarctic fulmars (Fulmarus glacialoides). We measured seven age classes for each species: adults, and nestlings that were 3, 8, 15, 28, 35, and 42â€‰days old. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) and thermal conductance (C) of adults averaged, respectively, 140% and 100% of values predicted allometrically for nonpasserine birds. Minimum metabolic rates of unfasted nestlings aged 15â€“42â€‰days averaged, respectively, 97% and 98% of predicted adult BMR in Antarctic petrels and snow petrels, versus 119% and 126% of predicted in Antarctic fulmars and cape petrels. Nestlings of the southerly breeding snow petrel and Antarctic petrel were relatively well insulated compared with nestlings of other high-latitude seabirds. Adult lower critical temperature (Tlc) was inversely related to body mass and averaged 9â€‰Â°C lower than predicted allometrically. As nestlings grew, their Tlc decreased with increasing body mass from ca. 14 to 22â€‰Â°C (depending upon species) at 3â€‰days of age, to âˆ’4 to 8â€‰Â°C when nestlings attained peak mass. Nestling Tlc subsequently increased as body mass decreased during pre-fledging weight recession. Nestling Tlc was close to mean air temperature from the end of brooding until fledging in the three surface nesting species.",2000,Journal of Comparative Physiology B
The influence of soil biotic factors on the ecology of two Trichoderma biocontrol agents,"only Development, stability and biocontrol activity of a formulation based on Pseudomonas fluorescens Ps06 Jenny Carolina RuÃ­z, Luisa Fernanda Izquierdo, Carlos AndrÃ©s Moreno, Martha Isabel GÃ³mez, Laura Fernanda Villamizar .................................................. 25-30 Abstract: A Colombian strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens Ps06 was formulated as a powder which stabilized cells viability during six months at 8Â°C Â± 2. This formulation significantly reduced (P < 0.05) incidence and severity of first symptoms of tomato crown rot in 86% and 50%, respectively. Developed biopesticide could be a useful tool to control F. oxysporum in tomato crop. Dynamics of yeasts in the phylloplane of strawberry Jane Debode, Wendy Van Hemelrijck, Piet Creemers, Martine Maes .................... 31-32 Abstract: Examination of the dynamics of the phylloplane yeast populations revealed immature fruits showed significantly larger populations than mature fruits or leaves. The dominant yeasts belong to the genera Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, as well as Sporobolomyces and showed resistance to the two major fungicides applied to strawberry cultures. This suggests potential use of phylloplane yeasts in the integrated control of fungal diseases in strawberry. Characterization of an alkaline serine protease of Aureobasidium pullulans involved in the biocontrol of postharvest diseases Davide Spadaro, Dianpeng Zhang, Angelo Garibaldi, Maria Lodovica Gullino ....... 33-35 Abstract: An alkaline protease gene was amplified and characterized from genomic DNA and cDNA of Aureobasidium pullulans PL5. Expression of ALP5 in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) yielded an homogeneous recombinant ALP5 which hydrolysed the substrate casein and inhibited the mycelial growth of the pathogens. This study provided the direct evidence that extracellular proteases secreted by the antagonist A. pullulans PL5 played a role in the biocontrol activities against some postharvest pathogens of apple and peach. What if it doesn't work? An example for a promising biological control agent that negatively influence the plant instead of helping it Tami Gat, Beni Kirshner, David Ezra ...................................................................... 37-38 Abstract: Plants were inoculated with the endophytic Penicillium sp. and then appeared to be over sensitive to phytopathogens, which is quite original in terms of biocontrol. In this case the inoculated plants displayed stronger symptoms than the control. On the other hand an extraction of the growth medium was found to be active and provided protection to plants against pathogens. It is likely that the benefit coming from the described endophyte will not be due to introduction of the endophyte into the plant rather using its secondary metabolites as ""natural pesticides"". Effectiveness of beneficial bacteria-mediated ISR against Botrytis cinerea in relation to priming of defense responses in grapevine Patricia Trotel-Aziz, Bas Verhagen, Charlotte Gruau, Maryline Magnin-Robert, Michel Couderchet, Christophe ClÃ©ment, Fabienne Baillieul, Aziz Aziz .................. 39-43 Abstract: Plants have evolved the ability to enhance their basal resistance after perception of specific stimuli, such as root colonization by selective rhizobacteria or derived microbialassociated molecular patterns. In this study, we examined the differences and similarities in term of the effectiveness of various bacteria with different origins to trigger ISR and to induce or prime some defence responses in grapevine. We especially focused on oxidative burst in grapevine cell suspensions and systemic production of stilbenic phytoalexins, trans-resveratrol and its dehydrodimer Îµ-viniferin in plants. First evidence of a Lysobacter member as a biological control agent of Plasmopara viticola Gerardo Puopolo, Emmanuel Jourdan, Marc Ongena, Ilaria Pertot ........................ 45-48 Abstract: With the climate change, the temperature is going to play a key role in the effectiveness of microbial biocontrol agents. The influence of this environmental factor on the ecology and biocontrol activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain S499 has been investigated in this work. On this purpose, the effect of temperature on the ability to move onto solid surface, to form biofilm, to persist onto plant rhizosphere and to induce systemic resistance in plants have been evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Biocontrol of fruit postharvest diseases by Aureobasidium pullulans Marta Mari, Wafa Rouissi, Camilla Martini, Alice Spadoni ....................................... 49-54 Abstract: The activity of a biological control agent, strain LL, previously identified as Aureobasidium pullulans, was tested for the first time on peach, apple and orange artificially inoculated with Monilinia laxa, M. fructicola, M. fructigena (peach) and Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum acutatum, Penicillium expansum (apple) and P. digitatum, P. italicum (orange). The washed cells of the antagonist were effective against all eight pathogens, inhibiting decay by over 94%; in particular the antagonist completely controlled M. laxa, M. fructicola, C. acutatum, P. digitatum and P. italicum. To our knowledge this is the first study considering the biocontrol of eight postharvest fruit pathogens with an A. pullulans strain in the same experimental conditions. Under postharvest conditions, in peaches inoculated with Monilinia spp., treated with the antagonist and stored at 0Â°C for 21 days plus 7 days of shelf-life, the antagonist was able to completely inhibit M. laxa and M. fructicola. In the same way, blue mould caused by P. expansum was significantly reduced on apple, after 120 days at 0Â°C, plus 7 days at 20Â°C. In in vitro trials, the VOCs released by the antagonist significantly inhibited the growth of all seven tested pathogens compared to the control, although with a different rate depending on the pathogen. These preliminary data, showing the efficacy of the A. pullulans LL strain in the control of the main postharvest fruit diseases, are promising for the development of a biofungicide for postharvest applications on a wide range of species and pathogens. Efficacy of a biological control agent and four fungicides in the control of postharvest decay in the pear cultivar Forelle Pieter Janse van Rensberg, Cheryl Lennox ........................................................... 55-57 Abstract: Main pathogens isolated from symptomatic Forelle pears were Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium expansum and Alternaria spp. Iprodione and pyrimethanil significantly reduced total decay in 2010. In 2011 fludioxonil, iprodione, pyrimethanil and pyrimethanil plus imazalil were also efficient. These fungicides decreased Penicillium expansum, Alternaria spp. effects and secondary decay caused by Botrytis cinerea. The biological control agent Cryptococcus albidus significantly reduced decay associated with a combined group of minor pathogens in 2011but was not efficient against the major pathogens in either year, indicating that postharvest fungicides tested are effective in controlling postharvest decay of pear fruit surface. However, these fungicides do not control calyx end decay caused by latent infections of Botrytis cinerea. In this context Cryptococcus albidus does not appear as an effective biological control agent for postharvest decay of Forelle pear. Induced systemic resistance in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) by biochar soil amendment Yael Meller Harel, Zeraye Haile Mehari, Yigal Elad, Dalia Rav-David, Menahem Borenstein, Ran Shulchani, Ellen R. Graber .......................................... 59-64 Abstract: Grey mould, caused by Botrytis cinerea, is a major fungal disease of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) world-wide. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular pathways involved in the induced resistance against B. cinerea in tomato plants grown on biochar amended medium. We observed that similar pathways of induction of defence-related gene expression take place in leaves of plants grown in biochar-amended medium independently of the biochar type and that the effect of biochar on gene expression increases with incubation time. In addition, a mutant def1, deficient in jasmonic acid lost its induced resistance ability when grown in a greenhouse biochar amended soil. This correlated with a loss of induction of expression of the genes belonging to the salicylic and jasmonic acid pathways. We conclude that Induced resistance by biochar amendment in tomato against grey mould depends on jasmonic acid synthesis. Genomic/transcriptomic studies to optimize the biocontrol effect of Stenotrophomonas rhizophila Mohammadali Alavi, Christin Zachow, Henry MÃ¼ller, Gabriele Berg ....................... 65-69 Abstract: The genus Stenotrophomonas is of high medical, ecological and biotechnological interest due to the versatility of the different species. For example, Stenotrophomonas rhizophila is a model for a rhizosphereand phylloplanecompetent, salt-tolerant biocontrol agent. One of the most effective strains S. rhizophila DSM 14405 T showed biocontrol activity on various crops (e.g. pepper, oilseed rape, cucumber) under salinated conditions in greenhouse and field trials. Strain DSM 14405 T does not only show rhizosphere competence and antagonistic activity; it also produces high amounts of osmoprotective substances allowing it to survive under saline conditions. New insights into its mode of action are presented from transcriptomic studies based on the genome. Furthermore, this information will be used to optimise the fermentation, formulation and efficiency of the biocontrol agent.

First order expansion of convex regularized estimators,"We consider first order expansions of convex penalized estimators in high-dimensional regression problems with random designs. Our setting includes linear regression and logistic regression as special cases. For a given penalty function $h$ and the corresponding penalized estimator $\hbeta$, we construct a quantity $\eta$, the first order expansion of $\hbeta$, such that the distance between $\hbeta$ and $\eta$ is an order of magnitude smaller than the estimation error $\|\hat{\beta} - \beta^*\|$. In this sense, the first order expansion $\eta$ can be thought of as a generalization of influence functions from the mathematical statistics literature to regularized estimators in high-dimensions. Such first order expansion implies that the risk of $\hat{\beta}$ is asymptotically the same as the risk of $\eta$ which leads to a precise characterization of the MSE of $\hbeta$; this characterization takes a particularly simple form for isotropic design. Such first order expansion also leads to inference results based on $\hat{\beta}$. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of such first order expansion for three regularizers: the Lasso in its constrained form, the lasso in its penalized form, and the Group-Lasso. The results apply to general loss functions under some conditions and those conditions are satisfied for the squared loss in linear regression and for the logistic loss in the logistic model.",2019,
"Slow skeletal muscle troponin T, titin and myosin light chain 3 are candidate prognostic biomarkers for Ewing's sarcoma","Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is a common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. Although great efforts have been made to understand the pathogenesis and development of ES, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The present study aimed to identify new key genes as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis, targeted therapy or prognosis of ES. mRNA expression profile chip data sets GSE17674, GSE17679 and GSE45544 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using the R software limma package, and functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the enrichplot package and GSEA software. The NetworkAnalyst online tool, as well as Cytoscape and its plug-ins cytoHubba and NetworkAnalyzer, were used to construct a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) and conduct module analysis to screen key (hub) genes. LABSO COX regression and overall survival (OS) analysis of the Hub genes were performed. A total of 211 DEGs were obtained by integrating and analyzing the three data sets. The functions and pathways of the DEGs were mainly associated with the regulation of small-molecule metabolic processes, cofactor-binding, amino acid, proteasome and ribosome biosynthesis in eukaryotes, as well as the Rac1, cell cycle and P53 signaling pathways. A total of one important module and 20 hub genes were screened from the PPI network using the Maximum Correlation Criteria algorithm of cytoHubba. LASSO COX regression results revealed that titin (TTN), fast skeletal muscle troponin T, skeletal muscle actin Î±-actin, nebulin, troponin C type 2 (fast), myosin light-chain 3 (MYL3), slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TNNT1), myosin-binding protein C1 slow-type, tropomyosin 3 and myosin heavy-chain 7 were associated with prognosis in patients with ES. The Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that high mRNA expression levels of TNNT1 (P<0.001), TTN (P=0.049), titin-cap (P=0.04), tropomodulin 1 (P=0.011), troponin I2 fast skeletal type (P=0.021) and MYL3 (P=0.017) were associated with poor OS in patients with ES. In conclusion, the DEGs identified in the present study may be key genes in the pathogenesis of ES, three of which, namely TNNT1, TTN and MYL3, may be potential prognostic biomarkers for ES.",2019,Oncology Letters
Parallel Sparse Subspace Clustering via Joint Sample and Parameter Blockwise Partition,"Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) is a classical method to cluster data with specific subspace structure for each group. It has many desirable theoretical properties and has been shown to be effective in various applications. However, under the condition of a large-scale dataset, learning the sparse sample affinity graph is computationally expensive. To tackle the computation time cost challenge, we develop a memory-efficient parallel framework for computing SSC via an alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) algorithm. The proposed framework partitions the data matrix into column blocks and then decomposes the original problem into parallel multivariate Lasso regression subproblems and samplewise operations. The proposed method allows us to allocate multiple cores/machines for the processing of individual column blocks. We propose a stochastic optimization algorithm to minimize the objective function. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed blockwise ADMM framework is substantially more efficient than its matrix counterpart used by SSC, without sacrificing performance in applications. Moreover, our approach is directly applicable to parallel neighborhood selection for Gaussian graphical models structure estimation.",2017,ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS)
Union of Intersections (UoI) for Interpretable Data Driven Discovery and Prediction,"The increasing size and complexity of scientific data could dramatically enhance discovery and prediction for basic scientific applications. Realizing this potential, however, requires novel statistical analysis methods that are both interpretable and predictive. We introduce Union of Intersections (UoI), a flexible, modular, and scalable framework for enhanced model selection and estimation. Methods based on UoI perform model selection and model estimation through intersection and union operations, respectively. We show that UoI-based methods achieve low-variance and nearly unbiased estimation of a small number of interpretable features, while maintaining high-quality prediction accuracy. We perform extensive numerical investigation to evaluate a UoI algorithm ($UoI_{Lasso}$) on synthetic and real data. In doing so, we demonstrate the extraction of interpretable functional networks from human electrophysiology recordings as well as accurate prediction of phenotypes from genotype-phenotype data with reduced features. We also show (with the $UoI_{L1Logistic}$ and $UoI_{CUR}$ variants of the basic framework) improved prediction parsimony for classification and matrix factorization on several benchmark biomedical data sets. These results suggest that methods based on the UoI framework could improve interpretation and prediction in data-driven discovery across scientific fields.",2017,
A systematic comparison of statistical methods to detect interactions in exposome-health associations,"BackgroundThere is growing interest in examining the simultaneous effects of multiple exposures and, more generally, the effects of mixtures of exposures, as part of the exposome concept (being defined as the totality of human environmental exposures from conception onwards). Uncovering such combined effects is challenging owing to the large number of exposures, several of them being highly correlated. We performed a simulation study in an exposome context to compare the performance of several statistical methods that have been proposed to detect statistical interactions.MethodsSimulations were based on an exposome including 237 exposures with a realistic correlation structure. We considered several statistical regression-based methods, including two-step Environment-Wide Association Study (EWAS2), the Deletion/Substitution/Addition (DSA) algorithm, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Group-Lasso INTERaction-NET (GLINTERNET), a three-step method based on regression trees and finally Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). We assessed the performance of each method in terms of model size, predictive ability, sensitivity and false discovery rate.ResultsGLINTERNET and DSA had better overall performance than the other methods, with GLINTERNET having better properties in terms of selecting the true predictors (sensitivity) and of predictive ability, while DSA had a lower number of false positives. In terms of ability to capture interaction terms, GLINTERNET and DSA had again the best performances, with the same trade-off between sensitivity and false discovery proportion. When GLINTERNET and DSA failed to select an exposure truly associated with the outcome, they tended to select a highly correlated one. When interactions were not present in the data, using variable selection methods that allowed for interactions had only slight costs in performance compared to methods that only searched for main effects.ConclusionsGLINTERNET and DSA provided better performance in detecting two-way interactions, compared to other existing methods.",2017,Environmental Health
Sea State Bias Estimation with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO),"With the sea-level rising, the measurement of sea surface height (SSH) is attracting more and more attention in the area of oceanography. Satellite radar altimeter is usually used to measure the SSH. However, deviation between the measured value and the actual one always exists. Among others, the sea state bias (SSB) is a main reason to cause the deviation. In general, one needs to estimate SSB first to correct the measured SSH. Currently, existing SSB estimation methods more or less have shortcomings, such as with many parameters, high prediction error and long training time. In this paper, we introduce an effective and efficient linear model called LASSO to the SSB estimation. The LASSO algorithm minimizes the residual sum of squares under the condition that the sum of the absolute values of each coefficient is less than a certain constant. In the implementation of LASSO, we use the significant wave height and wind speed to fit the LASSO model. Hence, the applied model has only 3 parameters, corresponding to the two inputs and a bias. Experimental results on the data of JASON-2, JASON-3, T/P and HY-2 radar altimetry show that LASSO performs better than geophysical data records (GDR) and ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. Moreover, from the running time, we can see that LASSO is very efficient.",2018,Journal of Ocean University of China
Introduction to Sankara & Burkina Faso,"In late 1982 Captain Blaise Compaore waited on the tiny airstrip of Bobo Dioulasso for a quick word during a stop-over of the internal flight which Captain Thomas Sankara was taking to Upper Volta's capital Ouagadougou. Captain Sankara was secretely carrying a draft document of the ideological basis for a new regime which he was to discuss on behalf of their group with various other political and military groupings opposed to the repressive military regime of Colonel Saye Zerbo. (Extracts follow from that document, which now, revised, forms the ideological background to the Sankara regime the Political Orientation speech of October 1983.) Captain Compaore had one question for his friend, 'what is this coup you are organising tomorrow?' It was the first Sankara had heard of the military coup which was to result within six months in, first, his being appointed Prime Minister, and, second, his arrest. On 4 August 1983 in another coup, the group themselves seized power and proclaimed an ambitious revolutionary break from the past.",1985,Review of African Political Economy
Metabolomic Profiling of Longâ€Term Weight Change: Role of Oxidative Stress and Urate Levels in Weight Gain,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the association between long-term weight change and blood metabolites.


METHODS
Change in BMI over 8.6â€‰Â±â€‰3.79 years was assessed in 3,176 females from the TwinsUK cohort (age range: 18.3-79.6, baseline BMI: 25.11â€‰Â±â€‰4.35) measured for 280 metabolites at follow-up. Statistically significant metabolites (adjusting for covariates) were included in a multivariable least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model. Findings were replicated in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) study (nâ€‰=â€‰1,760; age range: 25-70, baseline BMI: 27.72â€‰Â±â€‰4.53). The study examined whether the metabolites identified could prospectively predict weight change in KORA and in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) study (nâ€‰=â€‰471; age range: 55-74, baseline BMI:â€‰27.24â€‰Â±â€‰5.37).


RESULTS
Thirty metabolites were significantly associated with change in BMI per year in TwinsUK using Bonferroni correction. Four were independently associated with weight change in the multivariable LASSO model and replicated in KORA: namely, urate (meta-analysis Î² [95% CI]â€‰=â€‰0.05 [0.040 to 0.063]; Pâ€‰=â€‰1.37â€‰Ã—â€‰10-19 ), gamma-glutamyl valine (Î² [95% CI]â€‰=â€‰0.06 [0.046 to 0.070]; Pâ€‰=â€‰1.23â€‰Ã—â€‰10-20 ), butyrylcarnitine (Î² [95% CI]â€‰=â€‰0.04 [0.028 to 0.051]; Pâ€‰=â€‰6.72â€‰Ã—â€‰10-12 ), and 3-phenylpropionate (Î² [95% CI]â€‰=â€‰-0.03 [-0.041 to -0.019]; Pâ€‰=â€‰9.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8 ), all involved in oxidative stress. Higher levels of urate at baseline were associated with weight gain in KORA and PLCO.


CONCLUSIONS
Metabolites linked to higher oxidative stress are associated with increased long-term weight gain.",2017,"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)"
Quantitative Model checking,"We present QMC, a one-sided error Monte Carlo decision procedure for the LTL model-checking problem S |= Ï†. Besides serving as a randomized algorithm for LTL model checking, QMC delivers quantitative information about the likelihood that S |= Ï†. In particular, given a specification S of a finite-state system, an LTL formula Ï†, and parameters and Î´, QMC performs random sampling to compute an estimate e pZ of the expectation pZ that the language L(B) of the Buchi automaton B = BS Ã— BÂ¬Ï† is empty; B is such that L(B) = âˆ… iff S |= Ï†. A random sample in our case is a lasso, i.e. an initialized random walk through B ending in a cycle. The estimate e pZ output by QMC is an ( , Î´)approximation of pZâ€”one that is within a factor of 1Â± with probability at least 1âˆ’Î´â€”and is computed using a number of samples N that is optimal to within a constant factor, in expected time O(N Â·D) and expected space O(D), where D is Bâ€™s recurrence diameter. Experimental results demonstrate that QMC is fast, memory-efficient, and scales extremely well.",2004,
Non-convex penalized multitask regression using data depth-based penalties,"We propose a new class of nonconvex penalty functions, based on data depth functions, for multitask sparse penalized regression. These penalties quantify the relative position of rows of the coefficient matrix from a fixed distribution centered at the origin. We derive the theoretical properties of an approximate one-step sparse estimator of the coefficient matrix using local linear approximation of the penalty function, and provide algorithm for its computation. For orthogonal design and independent responses, the resulting thresholding rule enjoys near-minimax optimal risk performance, similar to the adaptive lasso (Zou, 2006). A simulation study and real data analysis demonstrate its effectiveness compared to some of the present methods that provide sparse solutions in multivariate regression.",2016,
De novo identification of differentially methylated regions in the human genome,"BackgroundThe identification and characterisation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between phenotypes in the human genome is of prime interest in epigenetics. We present a novel method, DMRcate, that fits replicated methylation measurements from the Illumina HM450K BeadChip (or 450K array) spatially across the genome using a Gaussian kernel. DMRcate identifies and ranks the most differentially methylated regions across the genome based on tunable kernel smoothing of the differential methylation (DM) signal. The method is agnostic to both genomic annotation and local change in the direction of the DM signal, removes the bias incurred from irregularly spaced methylation sites, and assigns significance to each DMR called via comparison to a null model.ResultsWe show that, for both simulated and real data, the predictive performance of DMRcate is superior to those of Bumphunter and Probe Lasso, and commensurate with that of comb-p. For the real data, we validate all array-derived DMRs from the candidate methods on a suite of DMRs derived from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing called from the same DNA samples, using two separate phenotype comparisons.ConclusionsThe agglomeration of genomically localised individual methylation sites into discrete DMRs is currently best served by a combination of DM-signal smoothing and subsequent threshold specification. The findings also suggest the design of the 450K array shows preference for CpG sites that are more likely to be differentially methylated, but its overall coverage does not adequately reflect the depth and complexity of methylation signatures afforded by sequencing.For the convenience of the research community we have created a user-friendly R software package called DMRcate, downloadable from Bioconductor and compatible with existing preprocessing packages, which allows others to apply the same DMR-finding method on 450K array data.",2014,Epigenetics & Chromatin
Assessing the robustness of sisVIVE in a Mendelian randomization study to estimate the causal effect of body mass index on income using multiple SNPs from understanding society,"The ""some invalid, some valid instrumental variable estimator"" (sisVIVE) is a lasso-based method for instrumental variables (IVs) regression of outcome on an exposure. In principle, sisVIVE is robust to some of the IVs in the analysis being invalid, in the sense of being related to the outcome variable through pathways not mediated by the exposure. In this paper, we consider the application of sisVIVE to a Mendelian randomization study in which multiple genetic variants are used as IVs to estimate the causal effect of body mass index on personal income in the presence of unobserved confounding. In addition to analyzing data from the large-scale longitudinal household survey Understanding Society, we conduct a simulation study to (a) assess the performance of sisVIVE in relation to that of competing robust methods like ""MR-Egger"" and ""MR-Median"" and (b) identify scenarios under which its absolute performance is poor. We find that sisVIVE outperforms alternative robust methods, in terms of mean-square error, across a wide range of scenarios, but that its performance is poor in absolute terms when the presence of indirect pleiotropy leads to failure of the ""InSIDE"" condition, which is not explicitly required for identification. We argue that this is because the consistency criterion for sisVIVE does not identify the true causal effect when InSIDE fails.",2019,Statistics in Medicine
New Skeletal Material of Thalassoleon (otariidae: Pinnipedia) from the Late Miocene-early Pliocene (hemphillian) of California,"New crania, dentitions, and postcrania of the fossil otariid Thalassoleon mexicanus are described from the latest Mioceneâ€early Pliocene Capistrano Formation of southern California. Previous morphological evidence for age variation and sexual dimorphism in this taxon is confirmed. Analysis of the dentition and postcrania of Thalassoleon mexicanus provides evidence of adaptations for pierce feeding, ambulatory terrestrial locomotion, and forelimb swimming in this basal otariid pinniped. Cladistic analysi s supports recognition of Thalassoleon as monophyletic and distinct from other basal otariids (i.e., Pithanotaria, Hydrarctos, and Callorhinus). Re-evaluation of the status of Thalassoleon supports recognition of two species, Thalassoleon mexicanus and Thalassoleon macnallyae, distributed in the eastern North Pacific. Recognition of a third species, Thalassoleon inouei from the western North Pacific, is questioned.",2005,
Developing a multivariable normal tissue complication probability model to predict late rectal bleeding following intensity-modulated radiation therapy,"Purpose: To develop a multivariable normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model to predict moderate to severe late rectal bleeding following intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Methods and materials: Sixty-eight patients with localized prostate cancer treated by IMRT from 2008 to 2011 were enrolled. The median follow-up time was 56 months. According to the criteria of D'Amico risk classifications, there were 9, 20 and 39 patients in low, intermediate and high-risk groups, respectively. Forty-two patients were combined with androgen deprivation therapy. Fifteen patients had suffered from grade 2 or more (grade 2+) late rectal bleeding. The numbers of predictors for a multivariable logistic regression NTCP model were determined by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Results: The most important predictors for late rectal bleeding ranked by LASSO were platelet count, risk group and the relative volume of rectum receiving at least 65 Gy (V65). The NTCP model of grade 2+ rectal bleeding was as follows: S = -17.49 + Platelets (1000/Î¼L) * (-0.025) + Risk group * Corresponding coefficient (low-risk group = 0; intermediate-risk group = 19.07; high-risk group = 20.41) + V65 * 0.045. Conclusions: A LASSO-based multivariable NTCP model comprising three important predictors (platelet count, risk group and V65) was established to predict the incidence of grade 2+ late rectal bleeding after IMRT.",2019,Journal of Cancer

Postinfectious Versus Infection-Related Glomerulonephritis.,"To the Editor: The article on infection-related glomerulonephritis (GN) by Glassock et al emphasizes the important differences between true â€œpostinfectious GN,â€ such as poststreptococcal GN, and infectionassociated GN, such as the IgA-dominant lesion associated with ongoing staphylococcal infection. There is another category of GN that we believe should also be included in the domain of â€œpostinfectious GN,â€ which is defined by the authors as including a latent period following an infection â€œlasting more than several days and up to a few weeks, during which the patient returns to or toward his or her usual state of health; and.ends with the acute onset of features of glomerulonephritis.and often some decrease in kidney functionâ€. Recent studies suggest that infections have a much wider role in GN, not only through the serum sicknessâ€“like mechanisms reviewed in the article from Glassock et al, but also because they initiate an autoimmune response. We have recently reviewed the multiple mechanisms by which infections likely initiate many common types of autoimmune GN, including ANCA-associated vasculitis, IgA nephropathy, membranoproliferative GN type 1, and lupus nephritis. Thus, the domain of postinfectious GN extends well beyond classical poststreptococcal disease or entities such as IgA-dominant staphylococcus-associated GN. We strongly endorse the goal of better understanding and treating infection-related GN that is stated in the title of the article by Glassock et al, but to achieve this, we need to extend our thinking about postinfectious GN beyond the traditional concepts of serum sickness due to bovine serum albumin to include the role of infections initiating GN through autoimmune mechanisms.",2015,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation
Correlated variables in regression: Clustering and sparse estimation,"We consider estimation in a high-dimensional linear model with strongly correlated variables. We propose to cluster the variables first and do subsequent sparse estimation such as the Lasso for cluster-representatives or the group Lasso based on the structure from the clusters. Regarding the first step, we present a novel and bottom-up agglomerative clustering algorithm based on canonical correlations, and we show that it finds an optimal solution and is statistically consistent. We also present some theoretical arguments that canonical correlation based clustering leads to a better-posed compatibility constant for the design matrix which ensures identifiability and an oracle inequality for the group Lasso. Furthermore, we discuss circumstances where cluster-representatives and using the Lasso as subsequent estimator leads to improved results for prediction and detection of variables. We complement the theoretical analysis with various empirical results.",2013,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference
An immune relevant signature for predicting prognoses and immunotherapeutic responses in patients with muscleâ€invasive bladder cancer (MIBC),"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are novel treatments that significantly improve the survival time of MIBC patients, but immunotherapeutic responses are different among MIBC patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find predictive biomarkers that can accurately identify MIBC patients who are sensitive to ICIs. In this study, we computed the relative abundances of 24 immune cells based on the expression profiles of MIBC patients using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Unsupervised clustering analysis of the 24 immune cells was performed to classify MIBC patients into different immune-infiltrating groups. Genome (gene mutation and copy number variation), transcriptome (mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA), and functional enrichment were found to be heterogeneous among different immune-infiltrating groups. We identified 282 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with immune infiltration by comparing the expression profiles of patients with different immune infiltration profiles, and 20 core prognostic DEGs were identified by univariate Cox regression analysis. An immune-relevant gene signature (TIM signature) consisting of nine key prognostic DEGs (CCDC80, CD3D, CIITA, FN1, GBP4, GNLY, SPINK1, UBD, and VIM) was constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and subgroup analysis confirmed that the TIM signature was an ideal biomarker for predicting the prognosis of MIBC patients. Its value in predicting immunotherapeutic responses was also validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (AUCÂ =Â 0.69, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.63-0.74) and the IMvigor210 cohort (AUCÂ =Â 0.64, 95%Â =Â 0.55-0.74). The TIM signature demonstrates a powerful ability to distinguish MIBC patients with different prognoses and immunotherapeutic responses, but more prospective studies are needed to assess its reliability in the future.",2020,Cancer Medicine
The ovary organization in the marine limnodriloidin Thalassodrilides cf. briani (Annelida: Clitellata: Naididae) resembles the ovary of freshwater tubificins.,"In Thalassodrilides cf. briani, the paired ovaries are inconspicuous and polarized structures with developmental gradient of germ cells along their long axis. The about 300 germ cells in the ovary are consolidated into one syncytial cyst and each cell is connected to a common and branched mass of cytoplasm via one stable cytoplasmic bridge. The germ cells differentiate their fate into nurse cells and oocytes. Only one oocyte grows in a given time; it gathers cell organelles and yolk and then it detaches from the gonad. Nurse cells appear to support oocytes development by providing with at least cell organelles. Such observations suggest ovary meroism. T. cf. briani, belonging to limnodriloidin naidids, has the same ovary organization as the representatives of tubificin naidids studied to date. This supports the concept of sister-group relations between Limnodriloidinae and Tubificinae. A similar ovary morphology is also known in several other groups of ""microdrile"" oligochaetes, which shows that this ovary type is the most widespread among this taxa. Moreover, living in marine or brackish-water sediments, T. cf. briani do not show any significant differences in their ovary structure and oogenesis with freshwater tubificins. This indicates its conservative character independent of the animal life environment.",2018,Zoology
Predicting Fluid Intelligence Using Anatomical Measures Within Functionally Defined Brain Networks,"The ABCD Neurocognitive Prediction Challenge (ABCD-NP-Challenge 2019) made available T1-weighted structural scans for children alongside their fluid intelligence scores. The goal of the challenge was to use this anatomical brain data to train a model that could be successful in predicting fluid intelligence scores from held-out T1-weighted structural scans taken of other children. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been moderately successful at identifying neural correlates of cognitive functioning, including intelligence. This study sought to leverage anatomical metrics within functionally defined regions, convolutional neural networks, and regression models to predict fluid intelligence. The proposed model performed competitively on the ABCD-NP-Challenge, and significantly outperformed a non deep-learning approach for behavior prediction based on the LASSO.",2019,
Feature Selection Bias in Assessing the Predictivity of SNPs for Alzheimer's Disease,"In the context of identifying related SNPs for a phenotype of interest (e.g., a disease status), we consider the problem of assessing the predictivity of SNPs that are selected by performing genome-wide association studies. Internal cross-validation (ICV) is a wrong but often used method for this assessment. With ICV, a subset of SNPs are pre-selected based on all samples then cross-validation (CV) is applied to assess the predictivity of the preselected SNPs. The predictivity estimate of the selected SNPs given by ICV is upwardly biased. This is often called the feature selection bias problem. The cause of this bias is that the feature selection procedure, which is a part of training procedure, is not external to the test samples in ICV. A correct method, called external cross-validation (ECV), is to re-select features based on only the training samples in each fold of CV such that the feature selection is external to test samples. The feature selection bias of ICV has been discussed by a few articles in the context of cancer diagnosis with microarray data. However, this problem has not received sufficient attention in the literature, especially in the context of predicting with SNP data. Many articles in the literature use ICV or do not state explicitly that their feature selection is external to test samples. In this thesis, we use an example of predicting late-onset Alzheimerâ€™s disease (LOAD) from selected SNPs to demonstrate that ICV could lead to severe false discovery. We use a real SNP dataset related to LOAD and two synthetic datasets (simulated response with real SNPs) for this demonstration. For the prediction, we compare the performances of three regularized logistic regression methods: LASSO, elasticnet, and a fully Bayesian hyper-LASSO method. For the LOAD dataset, we see that, except for APOE, no other SNPs can improve the prediction of LOAD using ECV method; however, the predictivity estimate of selected SNPs given by ICV can reach an R as high as 80%. For the synthetic datasets, we obtain the similar results as in the real dataset; additionally we see that the predictivity estimate of selected SNPs obtained with ICV can be even higher than the oracle predictivity of the truly related SNPs used to generate the response. In this study, we also find that the hyper-LASSO method can achieve better predictive performance than the LASSO and elastic-net. We recommend that ICV should not be used to measure the predictivity of selected SNPs and this statement should be made clear in research articles.",2019,
A Refinement of Lasso Regression Applied to Temperature Forecasting,"Abstract Model predictive controllers use accurate temperature forecasts to save energy by optimally controlling heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment while achieving comfort for occupants. In a â€œsmartâ€ building, i.e. one that is outfitted with sensors, temperature forecasts are computed from data gathered by these sensors. Recently, accurate temperature forecasts have been generated using relatively few observations from each sensor. However, long sensor histories are available in smart houses. In this paper we consider improving forecast accuracy by using up to 24 hours of quarter-hourly readings. In particular, we overcome forecast inaccuracy that arises from the â€œone standard errorâ€ heuristic (1SE) in lasso regression. When there are many historical observations, low variance in the error estimations can result in excessively high values for the lasso hyperparameter Î». We propose the midfel refinement of lasso regression, which adjusts Î» based on the shape of the error curve, resulting in improved forecast accuracy. We illustrate its effect in a setting where lasso regression is used to select sensors based on forecast accuracy. In this setting, midfel lasso regression using many historical observations has two effects: its improves accuracy and uses fewer sensors. Thus it potentially reduces costs arising both from energy usage and from sensor installation.",2018,
Shrinkage and LASSO strategies in high-dimensional heteroscedastic models,"ABSTRACT In this paper, we consider the estimation problem of the parameter vector in the linear regression model with heteroscedastic errors. First, under heteroscedastic errors, we study the performance of shrinkage-type estimators and their performance as compared to theunrestricted and restricted least squares estimators. In order to accommodate the heteroscedastic structure, we generalize an identity which is useful in deriving the risk function. Thanks to the established identity, we prove that shrinkage estimators dominate the unrestricted estimator. Finally, we explore the performance of high-dimensional heteroscedastic regression estimator as compared to classical LASSO and shrinkage estimators.",2016,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
Abstract 1387: Development of novel antiangiogenic biologics: multifunctional VEGF traps,"Current anti-VEGF biologics have been successfully used as therapeutic agents for cancer and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Since these strategies target VEGF systemically, side effects, long-term toxicities, such as proteinuria and thromboembolic events, and need for frequent eye injections in AMD treatment, prevail. Therefore, the aim of this study was to generate novel anti-VEGF biologics that inhibit VEGF activity specifically at the desired target site. Two classes of antibody-based recombinant proteins were engineered that simultaneously bind VEGF and either: 1) the extracellular matrix (ECM) or 2) target-site specific antigens. The first subgroup of proteins, â€œshV-H trapsâ€, is comprised of a Fc domain shortened form of VEGF-trap linked to a sequence of hydrophobic amino acids, with various affinities for heparin sulfate proteoglycans of the ECM, designed to have a short systemic half-life. The second subgroup of molecules, â€œV-lassosâ€, is composed of a C-terminus positioned form of VEGF-trap linked to single-chain variable domain antibodies specific for either HER-2 or fibronectin extra domain B (EDB), expressed on tumour cell surfaces or in the vascular bed of solid tumours, respectively. Recombinant proteins were expressed in transgenic cancer cell lines in a doxycycline inducible manner and were shown to inhibit VEGF activity and also retain the native function of their constituent domains. Specifically, the shV-H traps adhered to the ECM and the HER-2 V-lasso inhibited the proliferation of HER-2 positive cancer cell lines. Xenograft studies were performed using the aforementioned transgenic cancer cell lines in order to determine the efficacy of shV-H traps and Vlasso. shV-H traps were able to inhibit or delay tumour growth of A-673, Pc-3 and HT-29 xenografts. In contrast to soluble VEGF-trap, sh-VH traps were retained at the tumour site and were undetectable in the circulation. Moreover, sh-VH traps did not cause any of the side-effects observed with soluble VEGF-trap, such as delay of wound healing and regression of trachea blood vessels. Both Vlassos were able to inhibit or delay the tumour growth of SKOV-3 and A-673 xenografts. Furthermore, the transgenic approach for inducible expression indicated that HER-2 Vlasso is more effective compared to anti-HER-2 Ab and VEGF-trap used alone or in combination. Preliminary results suggest that high recombinant protein levels can be generated via large-scale production in 293F cells, indicating that the new multifunctional VEGF-traps can be produced in large amounts for clinical studies. These novel classes of anti-angiogenic molecules could potentially be advantageous in a clinical setting. Furthermore, they can be useful in order to further study and understand the mechanisms involved in VEGF inhibition. Finally, similar dual function proteins can be designed for inhibition of other molecules with disease relevance. Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

Returning to School after a Concussion: Facilitating Problem Solving through Effective Communication.,"Concussions are a major public health concern in the United States, especially among children and adolescents. Although there is a growing body of literature regarding the underlying physiologic processes that occur after a concussion, there is no consensus regarding the risk factors for a concussion or the reasons for significant differences in recovery. There is a paucity of research on the educational outcomes of students who sustain concussions because much of the current literature is based on adults and/or athletes. Researchers and practitioners are beginning to focus on youth with concussions with the goal of reducing incidence through prevention and facilitating recovery through accurate assessment and effective treatment. School psychologists can play a key role in prevention, assessment, and intervention through the implementation of a school-based concussion protocol. Effective communication between stakeholders is an essential component to this protocol, and is critical to the support and management of students who have sustained a concussion. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the current literature on concussions in youth and present a school-based protocol that includes a stepwise progression for assisting a student to â€œreturn to learnâ€ (Baker et al., 2014), integrated within a problem-solving model. The importance of effective interdisciplinary communication is emphasized throughout, and suggestions to enhance communication across stakeholders are presented. Concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) represents approximately 70â€“90% of all traumatic brain injuries (Cassidy et al., 2004), which is a significant proportion as it is estimated that 1.7â€“3.8 million traumatic brain injuries (TBI) occur in the United States annually (Langlois, Rutland-Brown, & Wald, 2006). This annual estimate should be considered conservative as many concussions suffered by individuals are not treated and therefore go undocumented (Reddy, Collins, & Gioia, 2008). When compared to adults, children and adolescents appear to be more susceptible and slower to recover from a concussion possibly due to differences in brain tissue maturation (Foley, Gregory, & Solomon, 2014; Mayer et al., 2012). The high nationwide prevalence of concussion, coupled with evidence that youth are disproportionately affected, positions school professionals in the critical role of supporting students who have sustained a concussion.

Fowler Avenue EDU 105, Tampa, FL 33620; kbradley@usf.edu. Copyright 2015 by the National Association of School Psychologists, ISSN 1938-2243 One way to support these students is through the implementation of a multitiered system of support. After discussing concussion-related terminology, symptoms, and risk factors, we present a tiered system that utilizes a ""return-to-learn"" (Baker et al., 2014) protocol consisting of prevention, assessment, intervention development, and progress monitoring. This framework not only focuses on the steps to take once a student has incurred a concussion, but also highlights preventative measures. An important aspect of this multitiered system of support is communication. For students who have experienced a concussion, communication of information across stakeholders (e.g., student, caregivers, educators, medical professionals) is critical. This article will discuss the importance of communication and ways to enhance partnerships across systems. The article concludes with a case study illustrating the recommended procedures to provide services to a student who sustained a concussion. CONCUSSION DEFINITION AND LANGUAGE One of the major barriers in applied practice and concussion research is the current lack of agreement on how to define a concussion, with some researchers arguing that concussion should be completely differentiated from other forms of mTBI (Bodin, Yeates, & Klamar, 2012). Despite the absence of diagnostic consensus, concussion is widely considered a significant public health concern about which we know very little (Graham, Rivara, Ford, & Spicer, 2014; Virji-Babul et al., 2013). For the purpose of this article, concussion will be referred to as a subset of mTBI defined by movement of the brain inside of the skull resulting in a disturbance of brain function (McCrory et al., 2013). In the concussion literature researchers often use the terms concussion and mTBI interchangeably. When we reference the literature, we will utilize the original authorsâ€™ verbiage if a single term is used consistently. If the researchers use the terms interchangeably, then we will use the term concussion. OVERVIEW OF POSTCONCUSSION SYMPTOMS The disruption of brain function after sustaining a concussion is thought to result in a constellation of cognitive, somatic, physical, affective, and sleep symptomatology known as postconcussion symptoms (Centers for Disease Control, 2014; McCrory et al., 2013). Although symptom presentation, onset, and duration are variable, familiarity with typical symptoms and their progression can help guide school personnel in their assessment and monitoring of children who have suffered a concussion. In many cases symptoms are often brief in duration with 80â€“90% of individuals experiencing concussion symptoms for only 7â€“10 days (McCrory et al., 2013). Although in most cases symptoms resolve quickly, there is evidence that in some populations, including children and adolescents, these symptoms are slower to resolve (Field, Collins, Lovell, & Maroon, 2003; Pellman, Lovell, Viano, & Casson, 2006). Acute physical symptoms may be present directly after the injury and can include loss of consciousness and posttraumatic amnesia. Somatic symptoms typically occur within 7 days of the concussion and include headache, fatigue, visual/auditory impairment, dizziness, and sleep disturbance (Eisenberg, Meehan, & Mannix, 2014). Cognitive symptoms are common in the first week after a concussion and may include impairments in concentration, processing, and working memory (Lundin, de Boussard, Edman, & Borg, 2006). Affective symptoms, including irritability, depression, and anxiety are also common and tend to appear, as well as persist, later into recovery (Eisenberg et al., 2014). When examining the presence of concussion symptoms over time, Eisenberg and colleagues (2014) found that 77% of youth reported symptoms 1 week post injury, 32% at 1 month, and 15% at 3 months. Symptoms lasting longer than 3 months are not typical, but do occur, and will be discussed in the upcoming section. Overall, the impact of concussion-related impairment (e.g., symptom, onset, duration) on student functioning can be significant (Parsons, Bay, & Valovich-McLeod, 2013; Vaughan, Gioia, & Sady, 2013). Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is needed in order to best facilitate a studentâ€™s complete recovery (e.g., physical, emotional, sleep) and a successful return to the learning environment. A basic NASP | School Psychology Forum: Research in Practice Returning to School After a Concussion | 185 understanding of symptoms and their progression will likely be an asset for school psychologists and other personnel as it may help inform assessment procedures following a concussion. PERSISTENT POSTCONCUSSION SYNDROME The term persistent postconcussion syndrome (PPCS) is often used to describe the prolonged recovery experienced by a subset of individuals who report three or more symptoms 3 months after the initial injury (Krause, Hsu, Schafer, & Afifi, 2014). Krause and colleagues examined the course of PPCS experienced by patients recruited from five southern Californian emergency departments who sustained an mTBI and compared them to a control group of patients with extracranial (non head) injuries. Results indicated that 32% of mTBI patients reported PPCS at 3 months (n 5 1129) and 28% at 6 months (n 5 995), while controls reported rates of 19% and 17% at the same time points. In addition to higher rates of reported PPCS, patients with an mTBI also indicated more severe symptomatology, as well as higher health service utilization and social disruption when compared to controls. For example, 8.9% of patients with an mTBI received medical outpatient care at 3 months compared to only 5.8% of the comparison group, though no tests of significance were reported. In a similar study utilizing a pediatric concussion sample (n 5 670) from a tertiary referral emergency department in Alberta, Canada, Barlow and colleagues (2010) observed that 13% of children were symptomatic at 3 months postinjury (0.5% reported by controls) and 2% continued to be symptomatic at 1 year postinjury (0.01% reported by controls). Individuals suffering from PPCS are of significant concern to educators, as their symptoms may have an impact on academic functioning and ability to learn for months to possibly years after the initial injury. CONCUSSION PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND OBSERVABLE SYMPTOMATOLOGY When the brain moves inside the skull during a concussion, it is thought to result in complex brain fluctuations often referred to as a neurometabolic cascade (Giza & Hovda, 2001). These acute changes in neurochemistry include rapid increases in calcium, potassium, glucose, glutamate, and a decrease in cerebral blood flow. In the post-acute phase, cerebral blood flow continues to be depressed with a concurrent decrease in brain glucose metabolism. Acute neurometabolic changes after a concussion have been positively correlated with the severity of self-reported symptoms, thus substantiating the clinical significance of this complex process (Henry, Tremblay, Boulanger, Ellemberg, & Lassonde, 2010). In addition to neurometabolic changes, there is growing evidence indicating the occurrence of microstructural brain injury, such as diffuse axonal injury among those who have susta",2015,
Variation in larval life-history traits among reef fishes across the Isthmus of Panama,"Abstract We tested the hypothesis that regional differences in oceanic productivity have led to the evolution of predictable patterns of regional variation in life-history traits of pelagic larvae of tropical reef fishes. To do so we compared larval traits (egg and hatchling size, larval growth rate and duration, and size at settlement) among closely related reef fishes from the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the Isthmus of Panama. This comparison provides a control for phylogenetic effects because those regions shared a common fauna prior to the rise of the Isthmus Ëœ3.5â€‰million years ago, subsequent to which each fauna evolved independently under a very different productivity regime. We measured larval traits of 12 benthic-spawning damselfishes (Pomacentridae: Abudefduf, Chromis and Stegastes) and 13 pelagic-spawning wrasses (Labridae: Bodianus, Halichoeres and Thalassoma). These included members of each genus on each side of the Isthmus and four sets of transisthmian sister species of pomacentrids. Among the pomacentrids we found consistent transisthmian differences in hatchling size, but not in other larval traits. Essentially the reverse pattern occurred among the labrids â€“ larval growth and duration differed consistently among congeners in the two regions, but without consistent differences in hatchling size or size at settlement. Neither relationship is predicted by the regional-productivity hypothesis. Most of the differences were quite small. Stronger phylogenetic effects on larval traits (inter- and intrageneric variation within regions) occur in both families and evidently overwhelm any effect of regional variation in productivity. Reassessment of data that takes into account such phylogenetic effects questions previous conclusions about the existence of regional differences in larval traits among damselfishes in the West Pacific and the Caribbean.",2001,Marine Biology
Modified Colon Leakage Score to Predict Anastomotic Leakage in Patients Who Underwent Left-Sided Colorectal Surgery,"Colon leakage score (CLS) was introduced as a clinical tool to predict anastomotic leakage (AL) in patients who underwent left-sided colorectal surgery, but its clinical validity has not been widely studied. We evaluated the clinical utility of CLS and developed a modified CLS (m-CLS). In total, 566 patients who underwent left-sided colorectal surgery were enrolled and categorized into training (n = 396) and validation (n = 170) sets via random sampling. Using CLS variables, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was applied for variable selection and predictive signature building in the training set. The model's performance was validated in the validation set. The predictive powers of m-CLS and CLS were compared by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve in the overall group. Twenty-three AL events (4.1%) were noted. The AL group had a significantly higher mean CLS than the No Leakage group (12.5 vs. 9.6, p = 0.001). Five clinical variables were selected and used to generate m-CLS. The predictive performance of m-CLS was similar in training and validation sets (AUROC 0.838 vs. 0.803, p = 0.724). In the overall set, m-CLS was significantly predictive of AL and performed better than CLS (AUROC 0.831 vs. 0.701, p = 0.008). In conclusion, LASSO-model-generated m-CLS could predict AL more accurately than CLS.",2019,Journal of Clinical Medicine
Low-Latency Service Schedule Orchestration in NFV-based Networks,"The Fifth Generation (5G) era is bringing tremendous new network capabilities enabling diverse services belonging to different business verticals (i.e., manufacturing, automotive, etc.) and provided with top-notch Quality of Service (QoS) (i.e., ultra-low latency, ultra-reliability, etc.). Empowered by soft-warization technologies such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV), 5G networks are envisioned to be agile, sustainable and self-organized. NFV promotes the automated provisioning of Network Services (NSs) through processing their traffic by a chain of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). As VNFs are shared between multiple NSs, a clear approach to map and schedule the carried traffic of these services is required. Hence, in this paper, we solve the Latency-Aware Service Schedule Orchestration problem (LASSO) that jointly addresses the mapping and scheduling of services to VNFs. We formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and we present ENCHAIN, a novel game-theoretic approach exploiting a scalable solution for the LASSO problem while providing each NS the freedom to decide on its own mapping and scheduling solution.",2019,2019 IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization (NetSoft)
Simplified Control for Complex IT Systems Using Dimension Reduction,"management of comp lex information technology (IT) applications and systems require dynamic configuration of both application-level and system-level parameters. The existence of large number of tunable paramete rs makes it difficult to design a feedback controller that adjusts these parameters effectively in order to achieve application-level quality of service (QoS) targets. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for simplified control of complex IT systems based on dimension reduction techniques. It combines online selection of critical control knobs through Lasso â€” a powerful L1-constrained fitting methods, and adaptive control of the identified knobs. The latter relies on the online estimation of the input-output m odel with the selected control knobs using the recursive least s quare (RLS) method and a self- tuning linear quadratic (LQ) optimal controller for output regulation. The results of a simulation study in Matlab are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",2008,
"Thalassomonas actiniarum sp. nov. and Thalassomonas haliotis sp. nov., isolated from marine animals.","Two marine heterotrophic bacteria, A5K-61(T) and A5K-106(T), were isolated from marine animals. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis data showed that the isolates were affiliated with the genus Thalassomonas; highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values were found with Thalassomonas viridans DSM 13754(T) (97.5 and 98.1 %, respectively). DNA-DNA hybridization values of strains A5K-61(T) and A5K-106(T) with T. viridans DSM 13754(T) (22.2-49.1 %) were clearly below 70 %, the generally accepted limit for species delineation. The isolates produced a brown diffusible pigment. The major respiratory quinone was Q-8 and the predominant cellular fatty acids were C(16 : 1)omega7c and C(16 : 0). Based on DNA-DNA hybridization data, some biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison, the isolates represent two novel species of the genus Thalassomonas, for which the names Thalassomonas actiniarum sp. nov.

An E-Government Service as PaaS Application to Serve Switzerland's Municipalities,"Municipalities seek a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that allows the integration and interoperability of e-governmental services with their own IT systems. Municipalities benefit from computational insights such as the quantification of the unicipalities' business landscape. This enables them to calculate the number of businesses they need to attract in a sector and in which ones they are positioned at or above average. We refer to this variable as market saturation. To the best of our knowledge nobody has yet tried to evaluate or build a platform independent service which allows municipalities to answer this question. We provide a solution to this problem and suggest a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) architecture, which can assess the number of suitable businesses for a municipality. We calculate these numbers by applying a LASSO regression and are able to predict the amount of businesses with a high degree of precision. Based on our previous findings about the non-linear distribution ofbusinesses in municipalities, we believe we can thus model thenumber of businesses in Switzerland's municipalities and founda way to distribute this knowledge through a hybrid IT architecture.",2016,2016 IEEE World Congress on Services (SERVICES)
Neutrophil chemiluminescence in response to Fusobacterium nucleatum.,"During the interaction of bacteria or other particles with neutrophils, oxygen consumption is increased, and unstable reduction products are produced. Chemiluminescence is the light energy produced in the neutrophil by the generation of unstable oxygen radicals. These oxygen radicals are thought to be important in the destruction of bacteria as well as host tissues. Therefore, we wanted to investigate the ability of Gram-negative plaque bacteria to stimulate neutrophil chemiluminescence in vitro. 
 
 
 
The major groups of bacteria examined were Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Capnocytophaga. Selenomonas. and Trcponema. Of these bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum had by far the greatest ability to stimulate neuirophil chemiluminescence in the absence of serum. Our results suggest that stimulation of neutrophil chemiluminescence by F. nucleatum is mediated by a protein moiety on the bacterial cell surface. This conclusion is supponed by experiments demonstrating significant inhibition of neuirophil chemiluminescence by heat, 2% formalin, or trypsin pre-treatment of F nucleatum. Also, neutrophil chemiluminescence was stimulated in a similar fashion with intact F. nucleatum only by the cellassociation centrifugation pellet of sonicated F. nucleatum. The monosaccharide D-galactose. which is a component of erythrocyte glycoproteins and F. nucleatum lipopolysaccharide. caused significant inhibition of neutrophil chemiluminescence at 100 mM final concentration. The unusual and pronounced ability of Fusobacterium nucleatum to stimulate neuirophil chemituminescence in the absence of serum might be important in the pathogenicity and/or host defense in periodontal disease.",1982,Journal of periodontal research
Novel machine learning and correlation network methods for genomic data,"Author(s): Song, Lin | Advisor(s): Horvath, Stefan | Abstract: Both correlation and mutual information (MI) are common co-expression measures. MI has a major advantage to measure non-linear relationships. However, it is not clear how much MI adds beyond standard (robust) correlation measures or regression model based association measures. We provided a comprehensive comparison between mutual information and correlation in 8 empirical data sets and in simulations. We confirmed close relationships between MI and correlation in all data sets. The biweight midcorrelation, a robust form of correlation, outperformed MI in terms of elucidating gene pairwise relationships. Coupled with the topological overlap matrix transformation, it often led to modules superior to MI and maximal information coefficient (MIC) in terms of gene ontology enrichment. In addition, we proposed the use of polynomial or spline regression models as an alternative to MI for capturing non-linear relationships between quantitative variables. Overall, our results indicated that MI networks could be safely replaced by correlation networks for stationary co-expression data.Sample classification, especially disease status prediction, is an important area of investigation for gene expression studies. Many machine learning methods, i.e. predictors, have been developed to tackle this problem. We proposed a novel bootstrap aggregated (bagged) GLM predictor randomGLM (RGLM) that shares superior accuracy and good interpretability. RGLM incorporates several elements of randomness and instability, such as random subspace method, optional interaction terms and forward feature selection. The prediction performances of various predictors were evaluated on hundreds of genomic data sets, the UCI machine learning benchmark data and simulations. RGLM often outperformed alternative methods including random forests and penalized regression models (ridge regression, elastic net, lasso) in both binary and continuous outcome predictions. Further, RGLM provides variable importance measures that can be used to define a ``thinned"" ensemble predictor (involving few features) retaining excellent predictive accuracy.RGLM has won the 2012 COPD Improver Challenge, in which we aimed to predict the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status based on gene expression data. We outlined how RGLM compared with random forest on the COPD data set, and discussed potential reasons for the superior performance of RGLM in this sub-challenge.",2013,
Editorial,"This issue of JET opens with Maria AssunÃ§Ã£o Flores from Portugal and Laila Niklasson from Sweden addressing the problem in their respective countries of falling recruitment to initial teacher education programmes. They do this by examining in some detail the studentsâ€™ perceptions of the recruitment process so as to clarify the reasons students choose an ITE programme and also how the findings from the research might be used to improve recruitment to ITE courses. It is worth noting that, despite the problems they identify with, amongst other factors, the status and salary of the teaching profession, in some countries recruitment seems not to be a problem, so it would be of interest to produce a comparative study which compared the findings from their research with those countries blessed with an oversupply of applicants to the profession. Another possible area of research suggested by the paper is how students perceive the different recruitment processes in those countries which have a number of distinctive routes into the profession. Either of these developments would be of interest to JET. Whereas Flores and Niklasson are concerned with the initial recruitment process, Siebrich de Vries, Ellen P.W.A. Jansen, Michelle Helms-Lorenz and Wim J.C.M. van de Grift address the next stage of preparing teachers, namely student teachersâ€™ initial perceptions of pedagogy and how these might influence their participation in classroom activities via a school-based practicum. Working with a large data-set which is part of a longitudinal study in the Netherlands they are able to show, amongst other findings, that student teachers with a pupil-oriented profile (as opposed to those with a subject-matter oriented profile) are more likely to be involved with learning activities in the classroom and, interestingly, with their own professional development. This group was a significant minority in the sample that was the focus of the research, which has implications that the paper discusses for initial teacher education programmes, in particular that these programmes are where a commitment to continued professional development can first be developed. Student teachersâ€™ perceptions of difference is the issue addressed by the next paper. Inclusion is a delicate subject and is rarely examined with reference to children of Roma descent, recognised as being one of the largest ethnic minorities in Europe. This omission is corrected in the study presented by Mojca PeÄek, SunÄica Macura-MilovanoviÄ‡ and NataÅ¡a VujisiÄ‡-Å½ivkoviÄ‡. Their research indicates, unfortunately, that the â€˜not in my backyardâ€™ (NIMBY) phenomenon seems to be prevalent with a significant number of the student teachers they researched, where the contradiction apparent in students accepting that Roma children should be taught in mainstream schools, but not in the classroom of the students themselves, seems to have passed unnoticed. Perhaps, a sympathetic explanation of this NIMBYism",2014,Journal of Education for Teaching
Logics of Action and Associative Experiences in Public Action for HIV/AIDS Control: Case of AAS and REVS+ in Burkina Faso,"The late 1990s was a significant landmark in HIV control all over the world and more particularly in Africa and Burkina Faso. Right from the outset in this country, the critical measures that public authorities and their international partners took against HIV, indeed encompassed associations which became the mainspring in the national incentive. Hence, the emergence of associations in the bid to contain AIDS which was initiated and gathered momentum in the decade from 1990 to 2000. The key target of these NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and associations was to attend to HIV patients considered as being most vulnerable to this infection. As a consequence, their main challenge was to put forth specific initiatives to meet their numerous needs. The manifold implications stemming from assisting infected people (prophylaxis, treatment, psychological counselling and so on) alongside collective management in an environment streamlined by the government and international financial backers are indications of an ever-growing complexification of public action requiring from the associations an adaption to the process as well as seasonable responses. Being the much sought-after health partners, the social organizations display their social efficiency in the general interest. This research deals with the experience of two pioneering health partners (AAS and REVS+) that, as early as 1998, broke grounds in treating HIV patients long before the government made the move to use ARV and many other methods. It hinges upon field observation and sound interviews with the staff and members of these associations in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.",2018,
"Living with HIV: Women's experience in Burkina Faso, West Africa","Our study aimed at studying HIV-infected women's experience with sharing serostatus with their partner and their group support. A survey was carried out among 79 seropositive women involved in a therapeutic trial in Bobo-Dioulasso, following freely consented prenatal HIV testing. The study revealed that women are reluctant to inform their partners and fear being stigmatized by relatives and friends. The major concern reported was health consequences and most women wished to receive care. The non-governmental organizations supporting people living with HIV were not known by these women, but providing this information raised a high interest and many women considered joining them soon and getting themselves involved. These community-based organizations, lead by qualified and highly motivated volunteers, could facilitate a better social integration of HIV infected women in Burkina Faso.",2001,AIDS Care

"The mineralogy of the Golden Sunlight gold-silver telluride deposit, Whitehall, Montana, U.S.A.","SummaryThe Golden Sunlight gold-silver telluride deposit, hosted primarily within the Mineral Hill breccia pipe (MHBP), is spatially related to a high-level, Late Cretaceous multiple intrusive, alkaline to subalkaline porphyry system. Base metal veins and manganese (rhodochrosite) mineralization occur up to 2km from the MHBP and form part of a regional mineral zonation pattern genetically related to a low-grade porphyry molybdenum system. Proterozoic rocks of the LaHood Formation and the informally named Bull Mountain Group host the MHBP and contain stratabound sulphides/ sulphosalts (up to 50% pyrite with minor to trace amounts of chalcopyrite, tennantite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, galena, and molybdenite). Four periods of hypogene mineralization occur in the breccia pipe. Stages I and IV constitute ,â‰ˆ99% of the mineralization; native gold (4â€“11 wt.% Ag), calaverite, tetradymite, tellurobismuthite, Se-bearing Bi sulphosalts (aikinite, lindstrÃ¶mite, krupkaite, gladite, bismuthinite, and ?benjaminite), tennantite (Zn, Fe, Te, and Bi varieties), coloradoite, melonite, galena (up to 6.7 wt.% Bi and 6.4 wt.% Se), stannite, chalcocite, and the rare mineral buckhornite are included in stage Ib. Minor amounts of base metals are present in stage II. Gold-silver tellurides (krennerite, petzite, sylvanite, and possibly the rare â€œx-phaseâ€) developed in stage III whereas barite, fluorite, dolomite, magnesite, trace kaolinite, and sericite formed during stage IV. Utilizing the mineral assemblages in stage Ib, calculated values of logf Te2 and logf S2 range from -10.5 to -9.7, and -12.6 to -5.5, respectively.Ore forming components (e.g., Au, Ag, Te, Cu, Bi, Mo, and much of the S) were likely derived from the Late Cretaceous intrusive system with possible contributions from the Proterozoic host rocks.ZusammenfassungDie Golden Sunlight Gold-Silber-Tellurid-LagerstÃ¤tte, die hauptsÃ¤chlich im Brekzienschlot von Mineral Hill (Mineral Hill breccia pipe, MHBP) eingelagert ist, steht rÃ¤umlich mit einem erzreichen, multi-intrusiven, alkalischen bis sub-alkalischen Porphyritsystem aus der Oberkreide in Beziehung.

Cartilage Framework Fixation with 2-Octyl Cyanoacrylate in a Prelaminated Radial Forearm Free Flap Total Auricular Reconstruction,"Autologous total auricular reconstruction requires an intricately sculpted, curved, and stacked cartilaginous framework implanted under healthy vascularized tissue. The ideal fixation technique would be readily available, easy to deploy, and free of complications. Commonly used sutures can fracture fragile pieces, inadequately maintain shape, or migrate. Steel wire can erode through soft tissues, extrude, fracture, or become infected. We successfully used 2-octyl cyanoacrylate alone to fixate an autologous costal cartilage framework designed for a total auricular reconstruction in an adult trauma patient. We had no sutures or wires in the final construct. The key aspects of our technique included the following: use of small aliquots, application only at cartilage-to-cartilage interfaces, use of temporary shaping (needles and lasso sutures), and avoidance of excess spillage of adhesive on any portion that would directly contact soft tissue. The framework was implanted into a prelaminated radial forearm free flap, which was then transferred to the head and neck region at a second stage. At two-year follow-up, the framework held satisfactory shape without any complications such as resorption, exposure, or infection.",2019,Cureus
Parallel Lasso Screening for Big Data Optimization,"Lasso regression is a widely used technique in data mining for model selection and feature extraction. In many applications, it remains challenging to apply the regression model to large-scale problems that have massive data samples with high-dimensional features. One popular and promising strategy is to solve the Lasso problem in parallel. Parallel solvers run multiple cores in parallel on a shared memory system to speedup the computation, while the practical usage is limited by the huge dimension in the feature space. Screening is a promising method to solve the problem of high dimensionality by discarding the inactive features and removing them from optimization. However, when integrating screening methods with parallel solvers, most of solvers cannot guarantee the convergence on the reduced feature matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel framework by parallelizing screening methods and integrating it with our proposed parallel solver. We propose two parallel screening algorithms: Parallel Strong Rule (PSR) and Parallel Dual Polytope Projection (PDPP). For the parallel solver, we proposed an Asynchronous Grouped Coordinate Descent method (AGCD) to optimize the regression problem in parallel on the reduced feature matrix. AGCD is based on a grouped selection strategy to select the coordinate that has the maximum descent for the objective function in a group of candidates. Empirical studies on the real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed parallel framework has a superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art parallel solvers.",2016,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
Further progress for a fast scanning of nuclear emulsions with Large Angle Scanning System,"The LASSO (Large Angle Scanning System for OPERA) is a scanning system designed in the framework of the OPERA experiment as a result of several R&Ds aimed to improve the performance of the European Scanning System (ESS) by increasing the scanning speed, the angular acceptance and the efficiency in microtrack reconstruction. The novel Continuous Motion (CM) scanning approach allows to double the ESS nominal speed without any changes in the hardware set-up. The LASSO modular design makes the system easily adaptable to new hardware. The novel microtrack reconstruction algorithm has been developed to be efficient in both standard Stop&Go (SG) and CM modes, performing a number of corrections during the processing like corrections for vibrations, optical distortions, field of view curvature. As an intermediate step it reconstructs silver grains positions inside emulsion layer to make a transition from 2D images to real 3D traces of a charged particle. This allows the algorithm to have no internal limits on the slope of microtracks being equally efficient on all angles. The LASSO has been used for about one year for mass production scanning of emulsion films of OPERA, Muon Radiography and also of films employed to study nuclear fragmentation of ion beams used in medical physics. More than 50000 cm2 of the emulsion surface have been analyzed during this period.",2014,Journal of Instrumentation
Quality Management in Spanish Thalassotherapy Centers,"This article sets forth results from an empirical study to discover the level of implementation and degree of maturity of critical quality factors in Spanish thalassotherapy centers.

The method consisted of, first, using descriptive analysis to analyze the level of implementation of critical factors and secondly, applying exploratory factor analysis to validate the scale. The target population comprised 31 thalassotherapy centers out of a total of 44 identified nationwide in 2011. Results indicate that the level of implementation of critical factors is greater than 69 %.",2015,
A Dimension Reduction for Cluster Analysis using ODC and SODC,"Drawing scatter plots is usually the first step when conducting a cluster analysis. For high-dimensional data, scatter plots are usually drawn on the first few principal components. However, principal component analysis doesn't take into account the clustering structure and therefore such scatter plots may be misleading. In this manuscript, we reinvestigate an existing method, optimal discriminant clustering and propose to use it as a dimension reduction tool for cluster analysis. Furthermore, because in high-dimensional data many of the features may be noninformative for clustering, we propose sparse optimal discriminant clustering (SODC) by adding a variation of group-lasso penalty to ODC.",2014,
Counting pedestrians in crowded scenes with efficient sparse learning,"Counting pedestrians in crowded scenes provides powerful cues for several applications such as traffic, safety, and advertising analysis in urban areas. Recent research progress has shown that direct mapping from image statistics (e.g. area or texture histograms of people regions) to the number of pedestrians, also known as counting by regression, is a promise way of robust pedestrian counting. While leveraging arbitrary image features is encouraged in the counting by regression to improve the accuracy, this leads to risk of over-fitting issue. Furthermore, the most image statistics are sensitive to the way of foreground region segmentation. Hence, careful selection process on both segmentation and feature levels is needed. This paper presents an efficient sparse training method via LARS (Least Angle Regression) to achieve the selection process on both levels, which provides the both sparsity of Lasso and Group Lasso. The experimental results using synthetic and pedestrian counting dataset show that our method provides robust performance with reasonable training cost among the state of the art pedestrian counting methods.",2011,The First Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition
Data driven modeling and estimation of accumulated damage in mining vehicles using on-board sensors,"The life and condition of a MT65 mine truck frame is to a large extent related to how the machine is used. Damage from different stress cycles in the frame are accumulated over time, and measurements throughout the life of the machine are needed to monitor the condition. This results in high demands on the durability of sensors used. To make a monitoring system cheap and robust enough for a mining application, a small number of robust sensors are preferred rather than a multitude of local sensors such as strain gauges. The main question to be answered is whether a low number of robust on-board sensors can give the required information to recreate stress signals at various locations of the frame. Also the choice of sensors among many different locations and kinds are considered. A final question is whether the data could also be used to estimate road condition. By using accelerometer, gyroscope and strain gauge data from field tests of an Atlas Copco MT65 mine truck, coherence and Lassoregression were evaluated as means to select which signals to use. ARX-models for stress estimation were created using the same data. By simulating stress signals using the models, rain flow counting and damage accumulation calculations were performed. The results showed that a low number of on-board sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes could give enough information to recreate some of the stress signals measured. Together with a linear model, the estimated stress was accurate enough to evaluate the accumulated fatigue damage in a mining truck. The accumulated damage was also used to estimate the condition of the road on which the truck was traveling. To make a useful road monitoring Erik Jakobsson et al.

Structural and parametric uncertainties in full Bayesian and graphical lasso based approaches: Beyond edge weights in psychological networks,"Uncertainty over model structures poses a challenge for many approaches exploring effect strength parameters at system-level. Monte Carlo methods for full Bayesian model averaging over model structures require considerable computational resources, whereas bootstrapped graphical lasso and its approximations offer scalable alternatives with lower complexity. Although the computational efficiency of graphical lasso based approaches has prompted growing number of applications, the restrictive assumptions of this approach are frequently ignored. We demonstrate using an artificial and a real-world example that full Bayesian averaging using Bayesian networks provides detailed estimates through posterior distributions for structural and parametric uncertainties and it is a feasible alternative, which is routinely applicable in mid-sized biomedical problems with hundreds of variables. We compare Bayesian estimates with corresponding frequentist quantities from bootstrapped graphical lasso using pairwise Markov Random Fields, discussing also their different interpretations. We present results using synthetic data from an artificial model and using the UK Biobank data set to construct a psychopathological network centered around depression (this research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under Application Number 1602).",2017,2017 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)
A Semi-automatic Method to Guide the Choice of Ridge Parameter in Ridge Regression,"We consider the application of a popular penalised regression method, Ridge Regression, to data with very high dimensions and many more covariates than observations. Our motivation is the problem of out-of-sample prediction and the setting is high-density genotype data from a genome-wide association or resequencing study. Ridge regression has previously been shown to offer improved performance for prediction when compared with other penalised regression methods. One problem with ridge regression is the choice of an appropriate parameter for controlling the amount of shrinkage of the coefficient estimates. Here we propose a method for choosing the ridge parameter based on controlling the variance of the predicted observations in the model. 
Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our method outperforms subset selection based on univariate tests of association and another penalised regression method, HyperLasso regression, in terms of improved prediction error. We extend our approach to regression problems when the outcomes are binary (representing cases and controls, as is typically the setting for genome-wide association studies) and demonstrate the method on a real data example consisting of case-control and genotype data on Bipolar Disorder, taken from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and the Genetic Association Information Network.",2012,arXiv: Applications
"A Sporeâ€Pollen Assemblage from the Damoguaihe Formation in the Tamutsag Basin, Mongolia and Its Geological Implication","Based on the palynological data from Well Ta-19â€“36 and Well Ta-19â€“37 in the Ta'nan Sag, and Well Ta-22â€“1 and Well Ta-21â€“1 in the Bayin Gobi Sag, a spore-pollen assemblage from the Damoguaihe Formation is named as Cicatricosisporites minutaestriatus â€“ Aequitriradites spinulosus â€“ Protopinus sp. assemblage in the Tamutsag Basin, Mongolia. The assemblage is characterized by abundant gymnosperm pollen and diverse fern spores, counted 46.35%-65.57% and 34.43%-52.58% in percentage respectively. Among the gymnosperm pollen, Pinuspollenites sp. (2.66%-16.94%), Protopinus sp. (0â€“11.38%) and Protopicea sp. (0â€“10.81%) are dominant; and Alisporites sp., Cerebropollenites sp., Podocarpidites sp., and Abietineaepollenites sp. are common. Some important elements, such as Chasmatosporites sp., Callialasporites prominulus, Parvisaccites sp., Parcisporites sp., Jiaohepollis cf. annulatus, J. bellus, J. verus, Polycingulatisporites sp., Schizaeoisporites certus, Classopollis annulatus are seen. Within the fern spores, Osmundacidites wellamanii (0.85%-4.93%), Appendicisporites sp. (0â€“4.45%), Baculatisporites comaumensis (0.80%-2.87%), Cicatricosisporites sp. (0.51%-2.66%), C. minor (0â€“2.14%), Foraminisporis asymmetricus (0â€“2.40%), Aequitriradites sp. (0â€“2,19%) and Cyathidites minor (0â€“2.13%) are dominant; and some specie of Densoisporites, Cooksonites, Impardecispora, Pilosisporites, Schizaeosprites, Fixisporites, Leptolepidites, Trilobosporites, Kuylisporites, Klukisporites, Hsuisporites, Couperisporites, Maculatisporites are seen. The angiosperm pollen are rare in the assemblage, characterized by Clavatipollenites sp. (0â€“0.80%) and Songipollis sp. (0â€“0.27%). The geological age of the Damoguaihe Formation is assigned to Hauterivian â€“ Barremian of Early Cretaceous according to the palynological data, due to the fact that there existed a lot of diverse spores of the family Schizaeaceae and prosperous gymnosperm saccat pollen which the corpus and sacci are differentiated completely, and the presence of early angiosperm pollen of Clavatipollenites. However, the zircon U-Pb isotopic dating of the volcanic rocks in the Nantun Formation indicated that the overlying strata of the Nantun Formation, i.e. the Damoguaihe Formation must be younger than 127.0Â±2,0â€“137.9Â±1.5 Ma. This is consistent with the palynological data. Furthermore, the vegetation reconstructed on the palynological data of the Damoguaihe Formation is conifer forest with shrubs and grassland, belonging to the semi-humid or humid middle to south subtropical climate. Moreover, three new species, namely Biretisporites punctatus sp. nov., Chasmatosporites reticulates sp. nov. and Concentrisporites contractus sp. nov. are described here.",2014,Acta Geologica Sinica-english Edition
VariaciÃ³ molecular en les sintases d'Ã²xid nÃ­tric en poblacions humanes i susceptibilitat cardiovascular,"Les malalties complexes conformen en lactualitat la principal causa de mortalitat en les societats occidentals. Dentre elles, destaquen les malalties cardiovasculars per la seva elevada incidencia tot i mostrar diferencies poblacionals, com a la Mediterrania, on la mortalitat es inferior a la daltres paisos europeus. Els factors genetics semblen jugar un paper important en la predisposicio a patir aquestes malalties, actuant a diferents nivells i sobre diferents mecanismes de regulacio fisiologica. Loxid nitric (NO) es un dels elements implicats en aquesta regulacio mitjancant els seus efectes tan directes com indirectes. El present treball ha analitzat la variacio de 14 polimorfismes de DNA en els gens de les sintases doxid nitric NOS1, NOS2 i NOS3 en 9 poblacions humanes de la Peninsula Iberica, Sardenya, Sud de Franca, berbers del Nord dAfrica i Alemanya, per avaluar-ne la seva variabilitat a la Mediterrania i la seva utilitat per reconstruir la historia de les poblacions humanes. Alhora, sha analitzat la implicacio daquests polimorfismes en la predisposicio a la cardiopatia isquemica (CAI) mitjancant el test de desequilibri de la transmissio (TDT) en una mostra de 101 families nuclears (n=302) amb un fill afectat per CAI. Per tal destablir un significat funcional de les possibles associacions detectades shan analitzat els nivells de nitrats i nitrits (NOx), indicadors de la produccio doxid nitric. Totes tres regions geniques han presentat un elevat grau de desequilibri de lligament al llarg de tota la sequencia, inclus entre parelles de polimorfismes separats mes de 140 Kb. La variacio observada a nivell poblacional evidencia una variabilitat interpoblacional significativa estructurada en tres grups (Europa continental, Sardenya i Berbers del Marroc) amb una variabilitat mes gran entre els grups que dins dels grups. Aquesta variabilitat sha mostrat equivalent a la daltres polimorfismes en regions no funcionals que sutilitzen en estudis de genetics de poblacions, tot i que la variabilitat al gen NOS3 semblaria menys adequada per detectar relacions interpoblacionals. Les poblacions sardes analitzades es mostren com les mes diferenciades de la resta i les de menor variabilitat. Daltra banda, les poblacions berbers mostren la major variabilitat del conjunt i una relativa heterogeneitat entre si, diferenciant-se de la resta de poblacions analitzades. Lallel T del polimorfisme C3391T del gen NOS1 sha associat, sol o en haplotips que linclouen, amb un risc incrementat per la CAI (RR=1.8-2.0), aixi com tambe amb nivells disminuits de nitrats i nitrits en plasma en els fills amb hipertensio. La manca de funcionalitat daquest polimorfisme fa suposar que un altre polimorfisme (possiblement a la regio codificant pel domini reductasa de la proteina) sigui el veritable causant daquesta associacio. Lallel de 9 repeticions del pentanucleotid (CCTTT)n de la regio promotora del gen NOS2 ha presentat associacio significativa amb la malaltia (p=0.008) conferint un risc menor per la CAI (RR=0.027). Lestudi de la regio promotora daquest gen podria proporcionar informacio important sobre la implicacio del gen NOS2 en la malaltia cardiovascular. Al gen NOS3, els allels de =38 repeticions del dinucleotid (CA)n de lintro 13 es mostren significativament associats a un menor risc (RR=0.17) per la CAI. Estudis in vivo i in vitro indiquen que lassociacio podria estar relacionada amb una major eficiencia en els processos de splicing, tot i que els resultats discrepen totalment amb els dalguns treballs previs.
"" EXTRACTE EN ANGLES - SUMMARY:
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality in western countries, although their incidence is not equally distributed among them, showing Mediterranean countries the lowest mortalities in Europe. Genetic risk factors play an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disorders, where nitric oxide (NO) mediates vasoprotective processes through reactions with its target molecules. The present work has analyzed the variation of 14 polymorphisms in the nitric oxide synthase (NOS1, NOS2 and NOS3) in 9 human populations from Iberian Peninsula, Sardinia, South France, berbers from North Africa, and Germany in order to evaluate their variation and their usefulness to reconstruct human populations history. Furthermore, an association study between these markers and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) has been performed in a 101 families sample (n=302) through transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). Aditionally, nitrate and nitrite (NOx) levels (indicators of NO production) have been quantified in the families sample to stablish a functional explanation for the detected associations. NOS variability has been useful to assess population relationships, being the most reliable estructuration that constituted by three groups: continental Europe, Sardinia, and North-Africa. Sardinian samples have shown the lower levels of intrapopulation variation and the Berber samples the highest heterogeneity. The T-allele of C3391T polymorphism in NOS1 gene has been associated with a lower risk for IHD (RR=1.8-2.0) together with lower NOx levels among hypertensive affected offspring. This polymorphism has not a functional role, and the association is probably related with an unidentified polymorphism in the NOS1 sequence. 9-repeats allele of the pentanucleotide (CCTTT)n in NOS2 promoter region plays a protective role (RR=0.27) in IHD, and the analysis of this promoter region could provide information on NOS2 implication in cardiovascular disease. In NOS3 gene, =38-repeats alleles of intron 13 (CA)n dinucleotide show a reduced risk (RR=0.17) for IHD. In vivo and in vitro models indicate that this association could be related to a greater efficacy in splicing processes, although there are discrepancies with previous association studies. """,2006,
Approximate Bayesian neural networks in genomic prediction,"BackgroundGenome-wide marker data are used both in phenotypic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genome-wide prediction (GWP). Typically, such studies include high-dimensional data with thousands to millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) recorded in hundreds to a few thousands individuals. Different machine-learning approaches have been used in GWAS and GWP effectively, but the use of neural networks (NN) and deep-learning is still scarce. This study presents a NN model for genomic SNP data.ResultsWe show, using both simulated and real pig data, that regularization is obtained using weight decay and dropout, and results in an approximate Bayesian (ABNN) model that can be used to obtain model averaged posterior predictions. The ABNN model is implemented in mxnet and shown to yield better prediction accuracy than genomic best linear unbiased prediction and Bayesian LASSO. The mean squared error was reduced by at least 6.5% in the simulated data and by at least 1% in the real data. Moreover, by comparing NN of different complexities, our results confirm that a shallow model with one layer, one neuron, one-hot encoding and a linear activation function performs better than more complex models.ConclusionsThe ABNN model provides a computationally efficient approach with good prediction performance and in which the weight components can also provide information on the importance of the SNPs. Hence, ABNN is suitable for both GWP and GWAS.",2018,"Genetics, Selection, Evolution : GSE"

Integrating spatial-anatomical regularization and structure sparsity into SVM: Improving interpretation of Alzheimer's disease classification,"Abstract In recent years, machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to the field of neuroimaging for classification and regression tasks. However, many approaches do not give an intuitive relation between the raw features and the diagnosis. Therefore, they are difficult for clinicians to interpret. Moreover, most approaches treat the features extracted from the brain (for example, voxelwise gray matter concentration maps from brain MRI) as independent variables and ignore their spatial and anatomical relations. In this paper, we present a new Support Vector Machine (SVM)â€based learning method for the classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which integrates spatialâ€anatomical information. In this way, spatialâ€neighbor features in the same anatomical region are encouraged to have similar weights in the SVM model. Secondly, we introduce a group lasso penalty to induce structure sparsity, which may help clinicians to assess the key regions involved in the disease. For solving this learning problem, we use an accelerated proximal gradient descent approach. We tested our method on the subset of ADNI data selected by Cuingnet et al. (2011) for Alzheimer's disease classification, as well as on an independent larger dataset from ADNI. Good classification performance is obtained for distinguishing cognitive normals (CN) vs. AD, as well as on distinguishing between various subâ€types (e.g. CN vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment). The model trained on Cuignet's dataset for AD vs. CN classification was directly used without reâ€training to the independent larger dataset. Good performance was achieved, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed methods. For all experiments, the classification results are comparable or better than the stateâ€ofâ€theâ€art, while the weight map more clearly indicates the key regions related to Alzheimer's disease.

The predictive value of CT-based radiomics in differentiating indolent from invasive lung adenocarcinoma in patients with pulmonary nodules,"ObjectivesAdenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) are assumed to be indolent lung adenocarcinoma with excellent prognosis. We aim to identify these lesions from invasive adenocarcinoma (IA) by a radiomics approach.MethodsThis retrospective study was approved by institutional review board with a waiver of informed consent. Pathologically confirmed lung adenocarcinomas manifested as lung nodules less than 3 cm were retrospectively identified. In-house software was used to quantitatively extract 60 CT-based radiomics features quantifying noduleâ€™s volume, intensity and texture property through manual segmentation. In order to differentiate AIS/MIA from IA, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was used for feature selection and developing radiomics signatures. The predictive performance of the signature was evaluated via receiver operating curve (ROC) and calibration curve, and validated using an independent cohort.Results402 eligible patients were included and divided into the primary cohort (n = 207) and the validation cohort (n = 195). Using the primary cohort, we developed a radiomics signature based on five radiomics features. The signature showed good discrimination between MIA/AIS and IA in both the primary and validation cohort, with AUCs of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91â€“0.98) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84â€“0.93), respectively. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that the signature (OR, 13.3; 95% CI, 6.2â€“28.5; p < 0.001) and gender (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2â€“10.9; p = 0.03) were independent predictors of indolent lung adenocarcinoma.ConclusionThe signature based on radiomics features helps to differentiate indolent from invasive lung adenocarcinoma, which might be useful in guiding the intervention choice for patients with pulmonary nodules.Key pointsâ€¢ Based on radiomics features, a signature is established to differentiate adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma from invasive lung adenocarcinoma.",2018,European Radiology
Linear regression analysis for interval-valued data based on the Lasso technique,"A new method for linear regression analysis of interval-valued data is proposed. In particular, the linear relationship between an interval-valued response variable and a set of interval-valued explanatory variables is investigated by considering two regression models, one for the midpoints (the locations of the intervals) of the response and explanatory variables and the other one for the radii (the imprecision). The regression coefficients of the two models are estimated in such a way that those for the midpoints are close to the corresponding ones for the radii as much as possible. Taking inspiration from the Lasso technique this is done by fixing a threshold expressing the maximum allowed level of diversity between the two sets of regression coefficients. The results of a simulation experiment and some applications to real data are reported in order to show the usefulness of the proposed method, called Lasso-IR (Lasso-based Interval-valued Regression).",2011,
"â€œAesthetics, Ecology and Google AI: A Preliminary Inquiry into Xenorationalityâ€ â€žEstetika, ekologie a Google AI","This paper presents a blueprint for a new aesthetic theory which is informed by recent developments in the philosophy of speculative realism on the one hand, and capable of addressing issues arising from the ecological crisis and the emergence of artificial intelligence on the other. The primary point of departure here is the philosophy of Quentin Meillassoux and Immanuel Kant. Aesthetics is understood as a speculative investigation of the realm of possible assemblages (or compositions) of entities. Such assemblages manifest xenorationality â€“ that is, non-human principles of association and composition. Drawing on the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Steven Shaviro, I define rationality as the investment of external objects into the human mind, rather than an autonomous subjective faculty. General genetics of xenorationality uncovers the original exteriority and ancestrality of rational principles vis-Ã -vis the human subject. Furthermore, xenorational aesthetics is demonstrated on the example of Google AI AlphaGo programâ€™s surprising move in the 2nd match against the worldâ€™s top Go player, Lee Sedol. This move was described by viewers as â€œinhumanâ€ yet â€œbeautifulâ€, and it will be argued that it was a manifestation of AlphaGoâ€™s xenorationality. Lastly, the argument can be generalised to planetary ecosystem processes, leading to an assessment of the aesthetic experience of xenorationality in the process of cognitive mapping as the major driver of socio-political practices in the",2018,
Occurrence of phlebitis related to peripheral venous catheterization in the emergency services of the Souro Sanou National Teaching Hospital in Burkina Faso.,"Patients must receive high-quality and safe health care. Peripheral venous catheterization (PVC) exposes patients to complications, mostly phlebitis. This study investigated the incidence of phlebitis and its PVC-related risk factors among patients in the medical and surgical emergency departments of the Souro Sanou University Hospital Center (CHUSS) in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. This prospective cross-sectional study took place from July 4 to August 3, 2018. The incidence of PVC-related phlebitis was calculated and its risk factors were identified by logistic regression, with SPSS software version 20 (entry option), with significance set at 5%. The 511 patients included in the study had a mean age of 44.7 (95% CI 43.1-46.3) years. The mean duration of PVC was 3.1 days. Of these patients, 149 developed phlebitis, for an incidence of 29.2% (95% CI 25.0%-33.0%). There was no statistically significant difference between the two emergency (medical and surgical) departments. Second-degree phlebitis accounted for slightly more than half the cases (53%). Risk factors associated with the occurrence of PVC-related phlebitis were female gender, catheterization duration more than 3 days, small size of the catheter, and the healthcare worker's failure to use friction in washing with a hydroalcoholic hand solution. Preventive measures are essential.",2019,Medecine et sante tropicales
Machine learning modeling of plant phenology based on coupling satellite and gridded meteorological dataset,"Changes in the timing of plant phenological phases are important proxies in contemporary climate research. However, most of the commonly used traditional phenological observations do not give any coherent spatial information. While consistent spatial data can be obtained from airborne sensors and preprocessed gridded meteorological data, not many studies robustly benefit from these data sources. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to create and evaluate different statistical models for reconstructing, predicting, and improving quality of phenological phases monitoring with the use of satellite and meteorological products. A quality-controlled dataset of the 13 BBCH plant phenophases in Poland was collected for the period 2007â€“2014. For each phenophase, statistical models were built using the most commonly applied regression-based machine learning techniques, such as multiple linear regression, lasso, principal component regression, generalized boosted models, and random forest. The quality of the models was estimated using a k-fold cross-validation. The obtained results showed varying potential for coupling meteorological derived indices with remote sensing products in terms of phenological modeling; however, application of both data sources improves modelsâ€™ accuracy from 0.6 to 4.6 day in terms of obtained RMSE. It is shown that a robust prediction of early phenological phases is mostly related to meteorological indices, whereas for autumn phenophases, there is a stronger information signal provided by satellite-derived vegetation metrics. Choosing a specific set of predictors and applying a robust preprocessing procedures is more important for final results than the selection of a particular statistical model. The average RMSE for the best models of all phenophases is 6.3, while the individual RMSE vary seasonally from 3.5 to 10 days. Models give reliable proxy for ground observations with RMSE below 5 days for early spring and late spring phenophases. For other phenophases, RMSE are higher and rise up to 9â€“10 days in the case of the earliest spring phenophases.",2018,International Journal of Biometeorology
A sufficient condition on monotonic increase of the number of nonzero entry in the optimizer of L1 norm penalized least-square problem,"The $\ell$-1 norm based optimization is widely used in signal processing, especially in recent compressed sensing theory. This paper studies the solution path of the $\ell$-1 norm penalized least-square problem, whose constrained form is known as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). A solution path is the set of all the optimizers with respect to the evolution of the hyperparameter (Lagrange multiplier). The study of the solution path is of great significance in viewing and understanding the profile of the tradeoff between the approximation and regularization terms. If the solution path of a given problem is known, it can help us to find the optimal hyperparameter under a given criterion such as the Akaike Information Criterion. In this paper we present a sufficient condition on $\ell$-1 norm penalized least-square problem. Under this sufficient condition, the number of nonzero entries in the optimizer or solution vector increases monotonically when the hyperparameter decreases. We also generalize the result to the often used total variation case, where the $\ell$-1 norm is taken over the first order derivative of the solution vector. We prove that the proposed condition has intrinsic connections with the condition given by Donoho, et al \cite{Donoho08} and the positive cone condition by Efron {\it el al} \cite{Efron04}. However, the proposed condition does not need to assume the sparsity level of the signal as required by Donoho et al's condition, and is easier to verify than Efron, et al's positive cone condition when being used for practical applications.",2011,ArXiv
More is better: Activators and repressors from the same gene,"Nicholas S. Foulkes and Paolo Sassone-Corsi Laboratoire de Genetique Moleculaire des Eucaryotes CNRS U184 INSERM Faculte de Medecine 67085 Strasbourg France The initiation of transcription in eukaryotes is an intricately controlled process. Short sequence motifs in the promoter regions of genes interact in a specific manner with DNA- binding transcription factors. These bound factors interact directly or indirectly with components of the general tran- scription machinery and thereby recruit RNA polymerases to transcribe the gene. For a given gene, the combination of cis control elements and the availability of transcription factors are major determinants of transcriptional activity. In turn, protein-protein interactions and posttranslational modifications of these factors are also important control points. A multitude of factors that activate and down- regulate transcription have been identified and character- ized in great detail. The presence of negative control in gene regulation has a number of advantages: for example, the silencing of genes whose expression is inappropriate and the down- regulation of induced gene expression (reviewed by Mitch- ell and Tjian, 1989; Lewin, 1990). Transcriptional down- regulators seem to work in different ways. Some factors possess DNA-binding domains but lack functional activa- tion domains; they compete with activators for binding to the same sites and thereby block activation. Alternatively, they can heterodimerize with activators, thereby reducing either their DNA-binding affinity or their ability to activate transcription. In addition, there are reports of repressors that interact with activator factors when they are bound to DNA and block their transactivation function. Another classof down-regulatorscomprises inhibitory proteins that sequester the activator in a complex that is unable to bind DNA (reviewed by Jackson, 1991; Jones, 1991). A recent twist in our understanding of transcription regu- lation has come with the discovery that activators and re- pressors can be encoded by the same gene. This finding has important implications for how positive and negative",1992,Cell
Livestock organic residue management in the urban and suburban area of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso).,"This study done in urban and suburban zone of BoboDioulasso was conducted by 233 breed farms. Results show that the breeders have some inadequate infrastructures for the manure collection. Indeed, 83.69% of the farmers abandon manure in the open air and 16.31% have some built excrement tanks with an evacuation frequency of 12Â± 20. In the relation witch the types of improving the im age of manure, four types of improving manure were identified. They are fertilizing fields (53%), selling (25%) to market gardeners, to cereal gardeners and to tree nursery men, exchanging again st the agricultural products and some agricultural sub products(18%) and producing biogas (4%). The management of the organic residues causes some environmental and sanitary problems to the farms residents who dread the smelling, the noise a nd the mosquitoes increasing. Introduction The breeding system nowadays enables to the develop ing countries to have low cost access to animal protein. Indeed, many recent publications insisted on the key roles that are supposed to be under the responsibility of husbandry for developing agricult ure in the Third-World countries [1; 2]. At that respect, even talk about revolution within the livestock sector particularly at citiesâ€™ border s to support population growth and moreover urbanization [1]. Indeed, in the context of the growing urbanization, two main issues emerge: food supply t o urban people and create employment opportunities. The suburban livestock contributes to address these major issues [3; 4]. In general, the option favoring the semi-intensive systems require to guarantee an annual growth of these systems that are less realistic. Despite the important roles urban livestock is play ing, its practice in urban and suburban areas is raising many concerns about nature [5; 6]. These c oncerns are on one hand nuisance (bad smelling, noise, dirtiness, etc.) and on the other hand, wate r and air pollution. The present study focused on the environmental and health problems caused by manure management in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso. Material and methods Study area This study is carried out in the area of Bobo-Dioul asso, located at 365 km far from Ouagadougou (capital city of Burkina Faso). Benefiting from cl imate of Sudanian type characterized by annual rainfall ranging between 800mm and 1,100mm, the sit e temperature is between 25 Â° C and 30 Â° C [7]. In the area, 457 cattle farms and approximately 623 of pigs were identified including 15% of intensified farms [8]. . Data collection and analysis Data were collected in 2011 thanks to an explorator y su vey in 233 urban and suburban farms (cattle, pigs, sheep, and poultry) in order to make the diag nosis (Table 1). The survey was done in one time and the interest points retained kept with the stud y objective. In total, 192 urban farms and 41 suburban farms have been diagnosed.

Predicting enrollment performance of investigational centers in phase III multi-center clinical trials,"Failure to meet subject recruitment targets in clinical trials continues to be a widespread problem with potentially serious scientific, logistical, financial and ethical consequences. On the operational level, enrollment-related issues may be mitigated by careful site selection and by allocating monitoring or training resources proportionally to the anticipated risk of poor enrollment. Such procedures require estimates of the expected recruitment performance that are sufficiently reliable to allow centers to be sensibly categorized. In this study, we investigate whether information obtained from feasibility questionnaires can potentially be used to predict which centers will and which centers will not meet their enrollment targets by means of multivariable logistic regression analysis. From a large set of 59 candidate predictors, we determined the subset that is optimal for predictive purposes using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularization. Although the extent to which the results are generalizable remains to be determined, they indicate that the prediction accuracy of the optimal model is only a marginal improvement over the intercept-only model, illustrating the difficulty of prediction in this setting.",2017,Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications
"Relationships among patient characteristics, irradiation treatment planning parameters, and treatment toxicity of acute radiation dermatitis after breast hybrid intensity modulation radiation therapy","To evaluate the relationships among patient characteristics, irradiation treatment planning parameters, and treatment toxicity of acute radiation dermatitis (RD) after breast hybrid intensity modulation radiation therapy (IMRT). The study cohort consisted of 95 breast cancer patients treated with hybrid IMRT. RD grade â‰¥2 (2+) toxicity was defined as clinically significant. Patient characteristics and the irradiation treatment planning parameters were used as the initial candidate factors. Prognostic factors were identified using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-based normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model. A univariate cut-off dose NTCP model was developed to find the dose-volume limitation. Fifty-two (54.7%) of ninety-five patients experienced acute RD grade 2+ toxicity. The volume of skin receiving a dose >35 Gy (V35) was the most significant dosimetric predictor associated with RD grade 2+ toxicity. The NTCP model parameters for V35Gy were TV50 = 85.7 mL and Î³50 = 0.77, where TV50 was defined as the volume corresponding to a 50% incidence of complications, and Î³50 was the normalized slope of the volume-response curve. Additional potential predictive patient characteristics were energy and surgery, but the results were not statistically significant. To ensure a better quality of life and compliance for breast hybrid IMRT patients, the skin volume receiving a dose >35 Gy should be limited to <85.7 mL to keep the incidence of RD grade 2+ toxicities below 50%. To avoid RD toxicity, the volume of skin receiving a dose >35 Gy should follow sparing tolerance and the inherent patient characteristics should be considered.",2018,PLoS ONE
Regularization and Estimation in Regression with Cluster Variables,"Clustering Lasso, a new regularization method for linear regressions is proposed in the paper. The Clustering Lasso can select variable while keeping the correlation structures among variables. In addition, Clustering Lasso encourages selection of clusters of variables, so that variables having the same mechanism of predicting the response variable will be selected together in the regression model. A real microarray data example and simulation studies show that Clustering Lasso outperforms Lasso in terms of prediction performance, particularly when there is collinearity among variables and/or when the number of predictors is larger than the number of observations. The Clustering Lasso paths can be obtained using any established algorithm for Lasso solution. An algorithm is proposed to construct variable correlation structures and to compute Clustering Lasso paths efficiently.",2014,Open Journal of Statistics
Global-Local Mixtures: A Unifying Framework,"Global-local mixtures, including Gaussian scale mixtures, have gained prominence in recent times, both as a sparsity inducing prior in p â‰« n problems as well as default priors for non-linear many-to-one functionals of high-dimensional parameters. Here we propose a unifying framework for global-local scale mixtures using the Cauchy-Schlomilch and Liouville integral transformation identities, and use the framework to build a new Bayesian sparse signal recovery method. This new method is a Bayesian counterpart of the $\sqrt {\text {Lasso}}$ (Belloni et al., Biometrika 98, 4, 791â€“806, 2011) that adapts to unknown error variance. Our framework also characterizes well-known scale mixture distributions including the Laplace density used in Bayesian Lasso, logit and quantile via a single integral identity. Finally, we derive a few convolutions that commonly arise in Bayesian inference and posit a conjecture concerning bridge and uniform correlation mixtures.",2020,
