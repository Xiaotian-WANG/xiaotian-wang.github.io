Incidence of and causes for all-cause hospitalizations in patients with atrial fibrillation,"Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice, and its prevalence is expected to further increase in the future. AF patients not only have a high number of comorbidities, but they also have an increased risk of hospital admissions compared to individuals without AF. Nevertheless, predicting hospital admission risk among patients with AF remains difficult, and possible preventive strategies unclear. 
Based on these gaps in knowledge, the overall goal of this PhD thesis was to investigate the incidence of and causes for all-cause hospital admission in patients with AF. The specific aims were (1) to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the current evidence of the incidence of and associated risk factors for hospital admissions in AF patients; (2) to identify risk factors for hospital admissions in our own cohorts and subsequently use this knowledge to develop and validate a risk score for predicting hospital admissions; (3) to identify psychosocial factors associated with hospital admissions in patients with AF. 
Methods: For the meta-analysis, we performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL, and pooled incidence rates for hospital admissions using random-effects models. Factors associated with observed between-study heterogeneity were identified using meta-regression analysis. 
For the second and third study, we used data of two ongoing, prospective observational cohort studies, the Basel Atrial Fibrillation Cohort Study (BEAT-AF) and the Swiss Atrial Fibrillation Cohort Study (Swiss-AF) in which 3,968 patients with diagnosed AF were enrolled. Unplanned hospital admissions were defined as any unpredicted admission leading to at least one overnight stay. For the second study, we used the Swiss-AF data set as the derivation cohort and performed a variable selection using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. Multivariable adjusted Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the effect of the selected variables on all-cause hospitalization. Based on regression coefficients we constructed a risk score and subsequently validated the score in the external validation cohort (BEAT-AF). 
For the third study, we used psychosocial factors, such as marital status, education, level of depression and health perception, and investigated their effects on risk of hospital admission. Cox regression analyses adjusted for conventional risk factors for hospital admission were performed to calculate hazard ratio (HR). 
Results: We included 35 studies of 311â€™314 AF patients in the meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of all-cause hospital admissions was 43.7 per 100 person-years. AF patients were more often admitted for cardiovascular causes (26.3 per 100 person-years), but the risk of non-cardiovascular hospitalizations was substantial (15.7 per 100 person-years). Associated factors for hospital admission were older age, longer follow-up time and prevalent chronic pulmonary disease or cancer. 
In the second study we found that the most important predictors for all-cause hospital admission were age (75-79 years: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.00-1.77; 80-84 years: aHR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.12-2.03; ï‚³85 years: aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.35-2.61), prior pulmonary vein isolation (aHR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.90), hypertension (aHR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.99-1.36), diabetes (aHR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.17-1.62), coronary heart disease (aHR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.37), prior stroke/TIA (aHR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10-1.50), heart failure (aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.41), peripheral artery disease (aHR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.63), cancer (aHR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.13-1.57), renal failure (aHR, 1.18, 95% CI, 1.01-1.38), and previous falls (aHR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.16-1.78). A risk score with these variables was well calibrated, and achieved a C statistic of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.66) in the derivation and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56-0.63) in the external validation cohort. 
In the third study including patients from Swiss-AF, 1582 (67.1%) were married, 156 (6.6%) were single, 287 (12.2%) were divorced, and 333 (14.1%) were widowed. Two hundred and seventy six patients (11.7%) had at most a primary education, 1171 (49.7) had secondary education, and 911 (38.6%) had a college or university degree. Depression or depressive symptoms was present in 99 (4.2%) patients. Median health perception was 75 (interquartile range [IQR], 60-85) on a scale ranging from 0-100, with higher scores indicated better health perception. The highest risk of all-cause hospital admission was observed in single (aHR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05-1.75) or divorced patients (aHR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.03-1.54), and in those who reported low health perception (aHR for <75 points, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21-1.61). 
Conclusions: The overall incidence of hospital admissions in patients with AF is high. The risk of hospital admissions is related to multiple cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular risk factors, including several psychosocial factors and subjective health perception. 
Outlook: Given the high risk among AF patients of being admitted to the hospital and the high burden of associated risk factors, new multidisciplinary preventive strategies are needed with the goal to reduce hospital admissions, unfavorable patient outcomes and healthcare costs.",2019,

Moment and IV Selection Approaches: A Comparative Simulation Study,"We compare three moment selection approaches, followed by post-selection estimation strategies. The first is adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (ALASSO) of Zou (2006), recently extended by Liao (2013) to possibly invalid moments in GMM. In this method, we select the valid instruments with ALASSO. The second method is based on the J test, as in Andrews and Lu (2001). The third one is using a Continuous Updating Objective (CUE) function. This last approach is based on Hong et al. (2003), who propose a penalized generalized empirical likelihood-based function to pick up valid moments. They use empirical likelihood, and exponential tilting in their simulations. However, the J-test-based approach of Andrews and Lu (2001) provides generally better moment selection results than the empirical likelihood and exponential tilting as can be seen in Hong et al. (2003). In this article, we examine penalized CUE as a third way of selecting valid moments. Following a determination of valid moments, we run unpenalized generalized method of moments (GMM) and CUE and model averaging technique of Okui (2011) to see which one has better postselection estimator performance for structural parameters. The simulations are aimed at the following questions: Which moment selection criterion can better select the valid ones and eliminate the invalid ones? Given the chosen instruments in the first stage, which strategy delivers the best finite sample performance? We find that the ALASSO in the model selection stage, coupled with either unpenalized GMM or moment averaging of Okui delivers generally the smallest root mean square error (RMSE) for the second stage coefficient estimators.",2016,Econometric Reviews
LARS: Stata module to perform least angle regression,"Least Angle Regression is a model-building algorithm that considers parsimony as well as prediction accuracy. This method is covered in detail by the paper Efron, Hastie, Johnstone and Tibshirani (2004), published in The Annals of Statistics. Their motivation for this method was a computationally simpler algorithm for the Lasso and Forward Stagewise regression. There are many criticisms of stepwise regression, one of which is that it is a ""greedy"" algorithm and that the regression coefficients are too large. Ridge regression is one method of model-building that shrinks the coefficients by making the sum of the squared coefficients less than some constant. The Lasso is similar but the constaint is that the sum of the ""mod"" coefficients is less than a constant. One implication of this will be that the solution will contain coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence have the property of parsimony i.e. a simpler model.",2006,Statistical Software Components

"Meillassoux and film : correlation, unreason and hyperchaos in French contemporary cinema","This thesis explores how some recent French films engage with the problem of correlation in their post-cinematic context. Drawing on the philosophy of Quentin Meillassoux, I argue that film reflects and reflects on the way it correlates both with the world, and with the Other of correlation, i.e. the humans involved at the various levels of the cinematographic experience. In order to theorize and analyse the affects emerging from the possible assemblages of these two distinct correlating correlates at work in the making of the post-cinematic real, I focus on a selection of contemporary French digital cinema (2009-2014). I analyse how these films reflect on their relation to consciousness, time, space and causality, and on their ability to produce novelty. 
 
I first discuss Enter the Void (Gaspard Noe, France/Germany/Italy/Canada/Japan, 2009) and Vous nâ€™Avez Encore Rien Vu/You Ainâ€™t Seen Nothinâ€™Yet (Alain Resnais, France/Germany, 2012) as two films that assume that consciousness is necessary and explore the impossibility for cinematic thought to think what is out of thought. I analyse how these films suggest that the world is unthinkable if not experienced by a consciousness with which it correlates, and that novelty is necessarily relative and develops in a closed system as the eternal return of affects. Chapter 2 focuses on films that suggest that this correlation is, however, not an absolute and that the way human consciousness processes the real could be radically other. The chapter focuses on Les Garcons et Guillaume, a Table/Me, Myself and Mum, (Guillaume Galienne, France/Belgium, 2013) and Ne Te Retourne Pas/Donâ€™t Look Back (Marina de Van, France/Luxemburg/Italy/Belgium, 2009), two films that play with the facticity of correlates, i.e. the fact that the laws according to which the real (time, space, bodies, affects) emerge can vary, and novelty can be produced. 
 
Chapters 3 and 4 radicalize facticity further by exploring the possibility of the facticity of becoming, i.e. a time without becoming, and engaging with filmic times that resonate with Meillassouxâ€™s concept of Hyperchaos. Chapter 3 discusses Rubber (Quentin Dupieux, France/Angola/USA, 2010) and Bird People (Pascale Ferrand, France, 2014) and develops the principle of unreason â€“ i.e. Meillassouxâ€™s concept according to which only contingency is necessary â€“ and its ethics. Finally, Chapter 4 explores Hyperchaos further, as a time without becoming that develops as a non-whole, by drawing on scenes from Holy Motors (Leos Carax, France/Germany, 2012) and Realite/Reality (Quentin Dupieux, France/Belgium/USA, 2014).",2019,
A deep learning approach to real-time parking occupancy prediction in spatio-termporal networks incorporating multiple spatio-temporal data sources,"A deep learning model is applied for predicting block-level parking occupancy in real time. The model leverages Graph-Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) to extract the spatial relations of traffic flow in large-scale networks, and utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) to capture the temporal features. In addition, the model is capable of taking multiple heterogeneously structured traffic data sources as input, such as parking meter transactions, traffic speed, and weather conditions. The model performance is evaluated through a case study in Pittsburgh downtown area. The proposed model outperforms other baseline methods including multi-layer LSTM and Lasso with an average testing MAPE of 10.6\% when predicting block-level parking occupancies 30 minutes in advance. The case study also shows that, in generally, the prediction model works better for business areas than for recreational locations. We found that incorporating traffic speed and weather information can significantly improve the prediction performance. Weather data is particularly useful for improving predicting accuracy in recreational areas.",2019,ArXiv

Factors affecting genomic selection revealed by empirical evidence in maize,"Abstract Genomic selection (GS) as a promising molecular breeding strategy has been widely implemented and evaluated for plant breeding, because it has remarkable superiority in enhancing genetic gain, reducing breeding time and expenditure, and accelerating the breeding process. In this study the factors affecting prediction accuracy (rMG) in GS were evaluated systematically, using six agronomic traits (plant height, ear height, ear length, ear diameter, grain yield per plant and hundred-kernel weight) evaluated in one natural and two biparental populations. The factors examined included marker density, population size, heritability, statistical model, population relationships and the ratio of population size between the training and testing sets, the last being revealed by resampling individuals in different proportions from a population. Prediction accuracy continuously increased as marker density and population size increased and was positively correlated with heritability; rMG showed a slight gain when the training set increased to three times as large as the testing set. Low predictive performance between unrelated populations could be attributed to different allele frequencies, and predictive ability and prediction accuracy could be improved by including more related lines in the training population. Among the seven statistical models examined, including ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), genomic BLUP (GBLUP), BayesA, BayesB, BayesC, Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Bayesian LASSO), and reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), the RKHS and additive-dominance model (Addâ€¯+â€¯Dom model) showed credible ability for capturing non-additive effects, particularly for complex traits with low heritability. Empirical evidence generated in this study for GS-relevant factors will help plant breeders to develop GS-assisted breeding strategies for more efficient development of varieties.",2018,Crop Journal
Estimation bounds and sharp oracle inequalities of regularized procedures with Lipschitz loss functions,"We obtain estimation error rates and sharp oracle inequalities for regularization procedures of the form [See the abstract on the paper for the formula] when ||.|| is any norm, F is a convex class of functions and l is a Lipschitz loss function satisfying a Bernstein condition over F. We explore both the bounded and subgaussian stochastic frameworks for the distribution of the f(Xi)'s, with no assumption on the distribution of the Yi's. The general results rely on two main objects: a complexity function, and a sparsity equation, that depend on the specific setting in hand (loss l and norm ||.||). As a proof of concept, we obtain minimax rates of convergence in the following problems: 1) matrix completion with any Lipschitz loss function, including the hinge and logistic loss for the so-called 1-bit matrix completion instance of the problem, and quantile losses for the general case, which enables to estimate any quantile on the entries of the matrix; 2) logistic LASSO and variants such as the logistic SLOPE; 3) kernel methods, where the loss is the hinge loss, and the regularization function is the RKHS norm.",2017,Annals of Statistics
Building and validating a predictive model for DVM academic performance,"Background: Predicting success in the veterinary curriculum with admissions variables is a longstanding interest of veterinary faculty. As linear models have consistently outperformed experts' opinions when making quantitative estimates, integrating them into admissions could both improve the outcome and reduce the burden of the admissions process. Aims and Objectives: To build and test linear models for predicting first year grade point average (GPA) and practice readiness in the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) program. Materials and Methods: The authors built and validated models for predicting first year GPA and clinical rotation performance using data from the college's application management system and internal records. Lasso regression was used to select the subset of variables that best predicted both first year GPA and clinical faculty's ratings of practice readiness. Results: Validated models indicated no application variables reliably predicted practice readiness. Only total undergraduate GPA, GRE verbal/quantitate score, reference letter positivity, and number of unexplained course withdrawals reliably predicted first year GPA. Conclusion: Selecting applicants who will be successful in the first year of the veterinary curriculum is an important objective, particularly given the challenges many students face during this part of the veterinary curriculum. The overarching goal of a veterinary curriculum, however, is to produce practice ready veterinarians, thus additional work must be done to improve our ability to identify applicants who will be poised for success upon graduation.",2019,Education in the Health Professions
"Pollen and Spores from the Tendaguru Beds, Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous of Southeast Tanzania: Palynostratigraphical and Paleoecological Implications","Two informal sporomorph assemblage zones can be distinguished in the dinosaur-bearing Tendaguru Beds of southeast Tanzanian. The first zone, the Classopollisâ€”Araucariacitesâ€”Shanbeipollenites Assemblage Zone, ranges from the Lower to the Upper Saurian Bed, and a mid-Oxfordian to Tithonian age is suggested based on the presence of Shanbeipollenites quadratus. The second zone, the Classopollisâ€”Cicatricosisporitesâ€”Ruffordiaspora Assemblage Zone, is restricted in the Trigonia schwarzi Bed, which overlies the Upper Saurian Bed. The combined ranges of Cicatricosisporites hughesii, Ruffordiaspora australiensis and Trilobosporites obsitus would be consistent with a late Berriasian to Hauterivian age of this zone. This is refined further to late Valanginian to Hauterivian on the basis of already existing evidence from fauna and dinoflagellate cysts. From a phytogeographic point of view the Tendaguru locality belongs to the southern Gondwana Trisaccates Province because of the presence of trisaccate podocarpaceous pollen. The quantitative composition of the palynofloras is characterized by the dominance or abundance of pollen produced by the two conifer families Cheirolepidiaceae (Classopollis) and Araucariaceae (mainly Araucariacites). Pollen of Cheirolepidiaceae, typically xerophytic, drought-resistant, thermophilic plants, is dominant throughout the Tendaguru Beds except in parts of the Middle Saurian Bed where pollen of Araucariaceae, a presumably mesic group, becomes most abundant. Classopollis attains the highest degree of dominance in the shallow marine deposits associated with the saurian beds. This may be related to paleoecological and taphonomic factors, namely abundance of Classopollis-producing plants in low-lying coastal environments close to the lagoonlike depositional sites and transportational sorting of sporomorphs leading to a relative enrichment of small and/or anemophilous pollen. The abundance of Araucariacites in the Middle Saurian Bed suggests that araucarians existed in coastal plain environments that were stable enough to allow the growth of large trees. This open araucarian forest, which may have been a source of food for high-browsing dinosaurs, was situated landward of the cheirolepidiacean belt not far from the depositional sites. Pteridophytes and bryophytes were concentrated at moist places and around water bodies. Podocarpaceous conifers producing bisaccate and trisaccate pollen grew in local uplands, while gnetaleans related to Ephedra and Welwitschia may have been present in dry places. The palynological evidence is consistent with a seasonally dry, tropical to sub-tropical paleoclimate. Three new combinations, Equisetosporites certus (Bolkhovitina), Jugella caichigÃ¼ensis (Volkheimer and Quattrocchio) and Trichotomosulcites microsaccatus (Couper), are proposed, and Jugella semistriata is described as a new species.",2010,
Fecal pollution source tracking and thalassogenic diseases: The temporal-spatial concordance between maximum concentrations of human mitochondrial DNA in seawater and Hepatitis A outbreaks among a coastal population.,"Fecal pollution source tracking (FST) studies the origin of fecal contamination and promotes action to eliminate it to improve human health and environmental sustainability. This work presents the temporal and spatial relations of human mitochondrial DNA (HmtDNA), fecal coliforms (FC) and live microbial biomass (ATP) in seawater during a hepatitis A outbreak among a human coastal population. The study area is approximately 100â€¯km along the coastline of the BiobÃ­o Region in the southeastern Pacific (Humboldt Current System, Chile). Total data from the swash zone from summer 2015 to autumn 2016 show there were significant positive log-log correlations between FC and HmtDNA (Râ€¯=â€¯0.32) and ATP (Râ€¯=â€¯0.31). These correlations were highest during the austral spring of 2015 (Râ€¯=â€¯0.53 and 0.58 respectively), when HmtDNA also correlated significantly with ATP (Râ€¯=â€¯0.86). Maximum average values of the parameters measured in this season showed a temporal-spatial concordance with the peak in the number of hepatitis A cases among the nearby coastal population. FC correlated significantly with HmtDNA (Râ€¯=â€¯0.98) in the water column of the coastal zone close to ConcepciÃ³n Bay during the austral summer of 2016 and in the swash zone of the bay (Râ€¯=â€¯0.68) throughout the study period. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) has also been detected in organisms and seawater in ConcepciÃ³n Bay, which is consistent with the high incidence of hepatitis A among the coastal population. The concordance between human fecal pollution in the study area and a seasonal hepatitis A outbreak strongly suggests that HmtDNA and its relation with FC and ATP in the coastal zone of marine environments can be used as a proxy to evaluate the risk of outbreaks of thalassogenic diseases.",2019,The Science of the total environment

Guideline for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia.,"Nosocomial pneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection that develops during a patient's hospitalization. It is neither present nor incubating at the time of admission and usually does not become manifest in the first 48-72 hours after admission. Diagnosing pneumonia may be difficult but generally depends on a combination of radiographic and clinical features such as a pulmonary infiltrates, fever, cough, and production of characteristic sputum.' In this guideline, no distinction is made between pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections, such as purulent bronchitis or lung abscess. Further, isolation techniques used to prevent transmission of microorganisms involved in pneumonia are mentioned only briefly, and prevention of tuberculosis is not discussed. Pneumonia accounts for 10% to 20% of all hospitalassociated infections and is the third most common nosocomial infection after urinary tract and surgical wound infections. In addition, pneumonia is the nosocomial infection most frequently related to death.2 Because of its frequency and high case-fatality rate, up to 50% in some reports,3"" nosocomial pneumonia constitutes a major infection control problem.",1983,Respiratory care
Economic Stimulus from Public Health Programs: Externalities from Mass AIDS Treatment Provision in South Africa,"Return on investment in international development assistance has attracted greater focus in recent years. Government programs, particularly public health programs, are likely to indirectly affect community members beyond the intended direct beneficiaries via externalities that could be many times larger than the direct benefits. This study evaluates the direct and indirect impact of the provision of mass AIDS treatment on labor market outcomes, using biomarker data to separately identify the impact by HIV status. We used rich data from a demographic surveillance site in rural South Africa with a 99% survey response rate. We leveraged differences in access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) that are uncorrelated with unobservables, and we used a set of rigorous causal inference methods, including machine learning (lasso), to estimate a plausibly causal impact. As ART access scaled up between 2004 and 2011, employment increased by 8.5 percentage points for HIV-infected individuals who were within 2 km from the nearest ART clinic compared to those more than 5 km away. We found sizable increases of 6.3 percentage points (22%) among HIV-uninfected individuals who had no HIV-infected household members. Labor force participation decreased over this period, which suggests that labor demand plays an important role in driving the observed employment increases. Our results demonstrate that the economic benefits of ART are broadly distributed, operate via channels outside the household, and have properties of a public good. Investments in health-related human capital may have important stimulus effects on local economies that should be considered alongside conventional economic policy. received from the Wellcome Trust.

For numerical analysis, we used relative efficiency and mean prediction error to compare the estimators which resulted in the shrinkage estimators to have better performance compared to the LASSO.",2018,Sort-statistics and Operations Research Transactions
Penetration and development of Allassogonoporus vespertilionis and Acanthatrium oregonense (Trematoda: Lecithodendriidae) cercariae in caddis fly larvae.,"Knight and Pratt (1955) described the life histories of Allassogonoporus vespertilionis Macy and Acanthatrium oregonense Macy, two lecithodendriid trematodes of bats. They reported that sporocysts of both flukes produced virgulate xiphidio-cercariae that developed into metacercariae in caddis fly larve. The metacercariae of A. vespertilionis encysted in the insect host whereas those of A. oregonense existed as unencysted, motile larvae. Adults of both species developed in hamsters which were fed metacercariae from naturally infected Limnophilus sp. larvae. While re-examining the life histories of these trematodes I have observed certain aspects of their development which were not reported by Knight and Pratt. These observations are presented in this report.

"Safety nets and safety ropes : comparing the dynamic benefit incidence of two Indonesian ""JPS"" programs","We examine the targeting performance of two programs created to respond to the social impacts of Indonesian crisis. We find strong evidence that subsidized sale of rice program was targeted to the â€œpermanentlyâ€ poor, while employment creation program was more responsive to expenditure shocks. A household which began in the third quintile of expenditures pre-crisis but was in the worst quintile by expenditure shock was four times more likely to have participated in the employment creation program than household which experienced the most positive shock. In contrast, the same household was only 50 percent more likely to receive subsidized rice (JEL I38). Imagine a number of mountain climbers scaling a sheer cliff face who, understandably, want protection from falling. One method would be to place a net at the bottom of the cliff to catch any falling climber just before they hit the ground. Another method is to provide a rope and a set of movable devices that can be attached to the cliff, so that as the climber scales the cliff they attach the rope at higher and higher levels, so that a climber falls only by the length of the rope. The â€œsafety netâ€ is a guarantee against a fall past an absolute level, while the â€œsafety ropeâ€ is a guarantee against a fall of more than a given distance. For climbers very near the bottom the safety net provides reassurance, but falling climbers who have made substantial progress will lose all of their progress only to be caught at the very bottom. While the metaphor of the â€œsocial safety netâ€ has become common, it actually conflates two distinct issues. One is a concern about increases in poverty which, as typically measured, is the extent to which people are currently below a given level of standard of living. The other is a concern for the mitigation of risk through â€œsocial insuranceâ€ or â€œsocial protectionâ€ to reduce households vulnerability to the wide variety of shocks they face. This mitigation is potentially important whether or not shocks push households below some absolute level. This confusion within â€œsocial safety netsâ€ also extends to the economics and political economy of â€œsafety netâ€ programs.2 The reasons why a government, either as a normative or positive matter, might want to implement these two types of programs are completely different.3 In Indonesia, as the result of the â€œkrismonâ€ (krisis moneter or monetary crisis 4) in the late 1990â€™s, there were several new programs launched, widely known as â€œJPSâ€ (Jaring Pengaman Sosial or social safety net). The programs were intended to help protect the traditionally poor and newly poor suffering from the crisis in four areas: (a) ensuring the availability of food at affordable prices for the poor, (b) supplementing purchasing power among poor households through employment creation, (c) preserving access of the poor to critical social services such as health and education, and (d) sustaining local economic activity through regional block grant programs and extension of small scale credit.5 This note is not a comprehensive evaluation of the entire range of programs or even a comprehensive picture of the implementation of the two programs we focus on. In this paper, we only examine the dynamic targeting of two of these JPS programs, i.e. the â€œOPKâ€ (Operasi Pasar Khusus or special market operation) a program of selling subsidized rice to targeted households and the â€œemployment creation programsâ€ (which were a collection of many different programs operated by different ministries). The remainder of this note is organized as follows. The first section discusses the programs and their methods of targeting. Section two briefly explains the source of the data, the â€œ100 Village Survey,â€ carried out by BPS and UNICEF. Section three discusses method used in evaluating the targeting effectiveness and the main empirical findings. Section four uses the results on the patterns of targeting of the two programs to examine the relative â€œtransferâ€ versus â€œinsuranceâ€ value of the patterns of pay off across shocks for households from various quintiles and highlights the issue of the positive political economy of targeting. Finally, section five provides conclusions. I. The Programs and Their Methods of Targeting The two key social safety net programs analyzed in this study use different targeting methods. Household eligibility for the OPK (cheap rice) program was based on the family planning agency (BKKBN) list of households by â€œwelfareâ€ status. In this classification, households are grouped into four levels of socioeconomic status: â€œpre-prosperous familiesâ€ (â€œkeluarga pra-sejahteraâ€ or KPS), â€œprosperous families levels I, II, and IIIâ€ (â€œkeluarga sejahteraâ€ or KS I, KS II, and KS III) based on a range of variables (food consumption, material of the house floor, type of health care services, ownership of changes of clothing, religious practices, etc.) as assessed by local BKKBN workers (kader).6 The KS I to KS III categories are often lumped together as KS (or â€œprosperous familiesâ€) category. The OPK program began in August 1998 and was brought up to roughly full scale in terms of household coverage (which included KPS and KS I) by the time of the December 1998 round of the survey.7 During the period covered by the data (August December 1998) each eligible household was entitled to purchase 10 kg at Rp. 1000/kg, while the market price for medium quality rice in October November 1998 period was around Rp. 2,500/kg.8 The magnitude of the subsidy was therefore roughly Rp. 15,000/household/month (compared to the total household expenditures at the 20th percentile in this sample of Rp. 232,000/month). The four major criticisms of using BKKBN list for targeting the OPK rice are that (a) it does not capture transitory shocks to income as it is based on relatively fixed assets (like not having a floor made of improved materials, owning changes of clothing); (b) it includes non-economic criteria (e.g. family able to meet religious obligations); (c) the list is compiled by relatively low trained workers at the village level so consistency across regions is not assured; and (d) the list is susceptible to changes by local government officials.9 Of course in practice the targeting mechanism was not always implemented as specified in the rules.10 BULOG (the National Logistics Agency) made the amounts of rice available to villages at the Dolog (Logistics Depot) and Sub-Dolog offices based on the eligibility lists, but the actual distribution of the rice to households was carried out by village level officials. Numerous field visits found that in some areas local decision-makers felt pressure from communities to change the distribution of rice from the designated â€œeligibleâ€ household to include other household which were deemed equally deserving, or even to extend coverage to the entire community (SMERU, 1998). A commonly heard argument was that since all the community was expected to contribute to community endeavors (e.g. gotong royong or â€œself-helpâ€) that all should benefit equally from the â€œwindfallâ€ assistance from the central government. In many cases the rice was divided up equally among all households, so that KPS and KS I households received less rice and some was also received by households with higher living standards.11 The impact of the use of community targeting and its impact on decisions is a new area of research (Galasso and Ravallion, 2000). The other JPS â€œprogramâ€ we examine was not a single program but a large set of activities under the name of padat karya (which in Bahasa Indonesia is an adjective meaning â€œlabor intensiveâ€). These programs were created as a response to the threat of burgeoning unemployment because of economic contraction during the crisis which had forced many firms to either lay off workers or shutdown completely. In accordance with the urban nature of the crisis, the initial geographical targets for the first round of these â€œcrashâ€ programs in fiscal year 1997/98 were directed to urban areas plus some rural areas which experienced harvest failures. Following on these â€œcrashâ€ programs in FY 1998/99, there was a proliferation of padat karya programs and there were more than a dozen different programs which fell into the â€œemployment creationâ€ category. These can be classified into four types. First, some programs were a redesigning of on-going investment and infrastructure projects into more labor intensive type projects and modes of contracts. Second, other programs gave block grants to local communities (such as the Kecamatan Development Project, Village Infrastructure Project, and PDM-DKE Program). These funds were directed to poorer areas, and had â€œmenusâ€ for the utilization of the funds that included the possibility of public works with a labor creating effect. A third set were special labor intensive works carried out by sectoral ministries (e.g. retraining of laid off workers carried out by the manpower ministry). A fourth type of program were â€œfood for workâ€ programs, typically launched by international donors and NGOs in the drought stricken areas. Unlike the OPK, the collection of padat karya programs were quite diverse and although specific programs were targeted to areas (e.g. drought), the lack of coordination meant there was little or no systematic geographic targeting of the set of programs overall. Within programs there were a variety of disagreements about desired characteristics of intended participants but typically the beneficiaries were not chosen according to any fixed administrative criteria. Hence, to the extent there was targeting, it was primarily through self-selection. Only those who were willing to work should have been able to receive the benefit. This self-selection mechanism has the advantage over administrative criteria of allowing individuals to choose to participate or not and creates the possibility of being more flexible to unobserved household shocks than administrative criteria (Jyotsn",2000,
Mineralogy and petrology of the Polino Monticellite Calciocarbonatite (Central Italy),"SummaryTwo small diatremes, about 0.25 my old, cut through Liassic limestones about 1 km NNE of the village of Polino (Long. 12Â°50'54â€³E-Lat. 42Â°35'34â€³N; Central Italy).The material filling the larger diatreme is mainly composed of a tuffisite with abundant lapilli showing concentric structure. Both unaltered country-rocks and massive hypabyssal carbonatite occur in the tuffisite as angular clasts and blocks, from a few mm up to more than 1 m in diameter.The Polino rock occurs in a strongly-potassic igneous district (Umbria Latium Ultra-alkaline District) which comprises phonolitic pyroclastic rocks and very rare kamafugitic lavas.Massive carbonatite blocks have an average mode of 53% Sr-Ba-rich calcite, 23% Fe-monticellite, 9% Th-perovskite plus Ti-magnetite, 6% Cr-phlogopite, 6% forsteritic olivine, about 2% Zr-schorlomite and ca. 1% Si-CO-OH apatite. Perovskite, schorlom ite, and apatite form cognate phases, whereas olivine and phlogopite, often replaced by monticellite, occur as nodules and as discrete grains with compositions and deformation features typical of mantle xenocrysts found in alkali basalts and ultramafic rocks.High modal content of Ca-carbonate, high Sr, Ba and LREE contents of calcite, the presence of rare minerals peculiar to carbonatitic rocks and an essential amount of monticellite indicate classification of the Polino rock as a monticellite calciocarbonatite.The Polino rock represents a carbonatitic melt strongly contaminated by mantle-crystal debris. It displays unusual geochemical features having trace elements closer to those of the regional-associated kamafugitic rocks rather than to those of common carbonatites.ZusammenfassungZwei kleine, um 0.25 Millionen Jahre alte Diatreme durchschlugen liassische Kalkgesteine, ungefdhr 1 km NNE des Dorfes Polino (Long. 12Â°50'54â€³E-Lat. 42Â°35'34â€³N; Mittelitalien). Das Material, aus dem das grÃ¶ÃŸere Diatrem besteht, ist Ã¼berwiegend Tuffisit mit hÃ¤ufigen Lapilli, die eine konzentrische Struktur zeigen. Sowohl nichtalterierte Nebengesteine, wie auch massive, hypabyssale Karbonatite treten im Tuffisit als eckige Klasten und BlÃ¶cke auf, mit einem Durchmesser von wenigen mm bis 1 m.Das Polino-Gestein tritt in einem sehr Kalium-reichen Vulkan-Distrikt (der Umbria-Latium Ultraalkaline Distrikt) auf, der aus phonolitischen Pyroklastika und untergeordnet aus kamafugitischen Laven aufgebaut ist.Massive Karbonatite bestehen im Durchschnitt aus 53% Sr-Ba-reichem Calcit, 23% Fe-Monticellit, 9% Th-Perovskit und Ti-Magnetit, 6% Cr-Phlogopit, 6% Fo-reichem Olivin, ungefdhr 2% Zr-Schorlomit und ca. 1 % Si-CO-OH-Apatit. Perovskit, Schorlo mit und Apatit bilden eine Mineralassoziation, wÃ¤hrend Olivin und Phlogopit, die hÃ¤ufig durch Monticellit verdrdngt sind, als Nodulen und Einzelkbrner auftreten.

Model order reduction of nonlinear parabolic PDE systems with moving boundaries using sparse proper orthogonal decomposition: Application to hydraulic fracturing,"Abstract Developing reduced-order models for nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems with time-varying spatial domains remains a key challenge as the dominant spatial patterns of the system change with time. To address this issue, there have been several studies where the time-varying spatial domain is transformed to the time-invariant spatial domain by using an analytical expression that describes how the spatial domain changes with time. However, this information is not available in many real-world applications, and therefore, the approach is not generally applicable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce sparse proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD)-Galerkin methodology that exploits the key features of ridge and lasso regularization techniques for the model order reduction of such systems. This methodology is successfully applied to a hydraulic fracturing process, and a series of simulation results indicates that it is more accurate in approximating the original nonlinear system than the standard POD-Galerkin methodology.",2018,Computers & Chemical Engineering
Model selection consistency from the perspective of generalization ability and VC theory with an application to Lasso,"Model selection is difficult to analyse yet theoretically and empirically important, especially for high-dimensional data analysis. Recently the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) has been applied in the statistical and econometric literature. Consis- tency of Lasso has been established under various conditions, some of which are difficult to verify in practice. In this paper, we study model selection from the perspective of generalization ability, under the framework of structural risk minimization (SRM) and Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory. The approach emphasizes the balance between the in-sample and out-of-sample fit, which can be achieved by using cross-validation to select a penalty on model complexity. We show that an exact relationship exists between the generalization ability of a model and model selection consistency. By implementing SRM and the VC inequality, we show that Lasso is L2-consistent for model selection under assumptions similar to those imposed on OLS. Furthermore, we derive a probabilistic bound for the distance between the penalized extremum estimator and the extremum estimator without penalty, which is dominated by overfitting. We also propose a new measurement of overfitting, GR2, based on generalization ability, that converges to zero if model selection is consistent. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed CV-Lasso algorithm performs well in terms of model selection and overfitting control.",2016,arXiv: Machine Learning
"Seagrass community-level controls over organic carbon storage are constrained by geophysical attributes within meadows of Zanzibar, Tanzania","Abstract. The aim of this work was to explore the feasibility of using plant functional
traits to identify differences in sediment organic carbon (OC) storage within
seagrass meadows. At 19 sites within three seagrass meadows in the coastal
waters of Zanzibar, Tanzania, species cover was estimated along with three
community traits hypothesized to influence sediment OC storage (above and
belowground biomass, seagrass tissue nitrogen content, and shoot density).
Sediments within four biogeographic zones (fore reef, reef flat, tidal
channel, and seagrass meadow) of the landscape were characterized, and
sediment cores were collected within seagrass meadows to quantify OC storage
in the top 25â€‰cm and top meter of the sediment. We identified five distinct
seagrass communities that had notable differences in the plant traits, which
were all residing within a thin veneer (ranging from 19 to 78â€‰cm thick) of
poorly sorted, medium to coarsely grained carbonate sands on top of carbonate
rock. One community (B), dominated by Thalassodendron ciliatum,
contained high amounts of above ( 972Â±74 â€‰gâ€‰DWâ€‰m âˆ’2 ) and
belowground ( 682Â±392 â€‰gâ€‰DWâ€‰m âˆ’2 ) biomass composed of low-elemental-quality tissues (leaf Câ€‰:â€‰Nâ€‰ = â€‰24.5; rhizome Câ€‰:â€‰Nâ€‰ = â€‰97). While
another community (C), dominated by small-bodied ephemeral seagrass species,
had significantly higher shoot density (4178Â shootsâ€‰m âˆ’2 ). However,
these traits did not translate into differences in sediment OC storage and
across all communities the percentage of OC within sediments was similar and
low (ranging from 0.15â€‰% to 0.75â€‰%), as was the estimated OC storage
in the top 25â€‰cm ( 14.1Â±2.2 â€‰MgÂ Câ€‰ha âˆ’1 ) and top meter ( 33.9Â±7.7 â€‰MgÂ Câ€‰ha âˆ’1 ) of sediment. These stock estimates are considerably
lower than the global average ( 194.2Â±20.2 â€‰MgÂ Câ€‰ha âˆ’1 ) reported for
other seagrass ecosystems and are on the lower end of the range of estimates
reported for the tropical Indo-Pacific bioregion (1.9 to
293â€‰MgÂ Câ€‰ha âˆ’1 ). The uniformly low OC storage across communities,
despite large inputs of low-quality belowground tissues in community B,
indicates that the geophysical conditions of the coarse, shallow sediments at
our sites were not conducive to OC stabilization and outweighed any
variation in the quantity or quality of seagrass litter inputs. These results
add to a growing body of evidence showing that geophysical conditions of the
sediment modulate the importance of plant traits in regards to retention of
OC within blue carbon ecosystems and cautions against the use of plant
traits as a proxy for sediment OC storage across all seagrass ecosystems.",2017,Biogeosciences

"Determinants of dividend payout and dividend propensity in an emerging market, Iran: an application of the LASSO","Accurate prediction of dividends is important for market participants such as investors, firm managers, and monitoring authorities, as they can, respectively, invest, manage dividend decisions, and monitor dividend policies more effectively. We identify the most relevant variables for predicting the dividend payout of the firms in an emerging market, Iran, using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The advantages of the LASSO include: enhancing the prediction accuracy of the dividend model, improving interpretation of the results, and applicability to high-dimensional data. We obtain several results. First, some fundamental determinants of dividends in the industrialized economies such as market-to-book ratio and current ratio, do not play a role in deciding dividends in Iran. Second, LASSO-selected variables outperform the variables commonly used in the literature in terms of model fit and prediction accuracy. Third, business risk, leverage, return on assets and effective tax rate are the most important predictors of dividend propensity of the Iranian firms. Fourth, if the support vector machine algorithm, an often-used classification method, is combined with LASSO-selected variables, it can better discriminate between dividend-paying and dividend non-paying firms than other methods such as logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis.Abbreviations: LASSO: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator; TSE: Tehran Stock Exchange; RMSE: Root Mean Squared Errors; MAE: Mean Absolute Errors; ROC: Receiver Operating Characteristics; GMM: Generalized Method of Moments; MENA: Middle East and North Africa region; AIC: Akaike Information Criterion; BIC: Bayesian Information Criterion; LARS: Least Angel Regression; OLS: Ordinary Least Squares; AUC: Area Under Curve; BS: Brier Score ; OA: Overall Accuracy; LDA: Linear Discriminant Analysis; SVM: Support Vector Machine algorithm; LR: Logistic Regression.",2019,Applied Economics
Tansillo in musica: il caso delle Â«Lagrime di san PietroÂ»,"Tansillo set to music: the case of Â«Le lagrime di SanÂ PietroÂ» There is no doubt that the fame of the poet Luigi TansilloÂ (1510-1568) with his contemporaries was widespread both inÂ Italy and abroad in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries;Â this is evidenced by the countless editions (frequentlyÂ posthumous) of excerpts from his canzoniere and of hisÂ poems, more or less authorized (either monographic orÂ included in miscellanies). The poetry of Luigi Tansillo wasÂ also much in demand with the musicians of his time (whoÂ were considerably attracted by Petrachism); only occasionallyÂ however has the musical success of his poems been theÂ subject of study on the part of current musicology. Compared to the immense literary success of Tansilloâ€™s LeÂ lagrime di San Pietro (which gave rise to an authentic schoolÂ of spiritual poetry), the scarce exploitation by musicians ofÂ this poem is extremely puzzling. As far as we know, only twoÂ composers in the late sixteenth century (who were moreoverÂ practically contemporaries), the little known Antonio DuetoÂ and the famous Orlando di Lasso, made use of the octavesÂ of this immense unfinished poem, dedicating them to twoÂ important members of the Aldobrandini family, Pope ClementÂ VIII and his cardinal nephew Pietro Aldobrandini. A clear picture of the relationship poetry-music in theÂ second half of the sixteenth century can be gathered from aÂ comparative examination of the diffusion of the literaryÂ editions and the consequent fortune in music of the publishedÂ texts. Tansilloâ€™s Le lagrime di San Pietro is a typical example. In the second half of the sixteenth century, some of the firstÂ partial editions of Le lagrime di San Pietro appeared inÂ Genoa, which then became a centre for the publication andÂ diffusion of Tansilloâ€™s poem. It is not therefore surprising toÂ find in this city a composer, Antonio Dueto, dynamic maestroÂ di cappella and canon of the Cathedral of San Lorenzo,Â absorbed in setting to music eight of the numerous octavesÂ of Le lagrime - and thereby incidentally proving the successÂ of the genre of devout poetry at the height of the Counter-Reformation. The edition of Duetoâ€™s cycle is reproduced atÂ the end of this paper.",2015,
A New Perspective on Boosting in Linear Regression via Subgradient Optimization and Relatives,"In this paper we analyze boosting algorithms in linear regression from a new perspective: that of modern first-order methods in convex optimization. We show that classic boosting algorithms in linear regression, namely the incremental forward stagewise algorithm (FS$_\varepsilon$) and least squares boosting (LS-Boost($\varepsilon$)), can be viewed as subgradient descent to minimize the loss function defined as the maximum absolute correlation between the features and residuals. We also propose a modification of FS$_\varepsilon$ that yields an algorithm for the Lasso, and that may be easily extended to an algorithm that computes the Lasso path for different values of the regularization parameter. Furthermore, we show that these new algorithms for the Lasso may also be interpreted as the same master algorithm (subgradient descent), applied to a regularized version of the maximum absolute correlation loss function. We derive novel, comprehensive computational guarantees for several boosting algorithms in linear regression (including LS-Boost($\varepsilon$) and FS$_\varepsilon$) by using techniques of modern first-order methods in convex optimization. Our computational guarantees inform us about the statistical properties of boosting algorithms. In particular they provide, for the first time, a precise theoretical description of the amount of data-fidelity and regularization imparted by running a boosting algorithm with a prespecified learning rate for a fixed but arbitrary number of iterations, for any dataset.",2015,ArXiv
"The network structure of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and somatic symptomatology.","BACKGROUND
Major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often co-occur with somatic symptomatology. Little is known about the contributions of individual symptoms to this association and more insight into their relationships could help to identify symptoms that are central in the processes behind the co-occurrence. This study explores associations between individual MDD/GAD symptoms and somatic symptoms by using the network approach.


METHOD
MDD/GAD symptoms were assessed in 2704 participants (mean age 41.7 years, 66.1% female) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Somatic symptoms were assessed with the somatization scale of the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire. The technique eLasso was used to estimate the network of MDD/GAD and somatic symptoms.


RESULTS
The network structure showed numerous associations between MDD/GAD and somatic symptoms. In general, neurovegetative and cognitive/affective MDD/GAD symptoms showed a similar strength of connections to the somatic domain. However, associations varied substantially across individual symptoms. MDD/GAD symptoms with many and strong associations to the somatic domain included anxiety and fatigue, whereas hypersomnia and insomnia showed no connections to somatic symptoms. Among somatic symptoms, excessive perspiration and pressure/tight feeling in chest were associated with the MDD/GAD domain, while muscle pain and tingling in fingers showed only a few weak associations.


CONCLUSIONS
Individual symptoms show differential associations in the co-occurrence of MDD/GAD with somatic symptomatology. Strongly interconnected symptoms are important in furthering our understanding of the interaction between the symptom domains, and may be valuable targets for future research and treatment.",2016,Psychological medicine
Comparison of regression techniques to predict response of oilseed rape yield to variation in climatic conditions in Denmark,"Abstract Statistical regression models represent alternatives to process-based dynamic models for predicting the response of crop yields to variation in climatic conditions. Regression models can be used to quantify the effect of change in temperature and precipitation on yields. However, it is difficult to identify the most relevant input variables that should be included in regression models due to the high number of candidate variables and to their correlations. This paper compares several regression techniques for modeling response of winter oilseed rape yield to a high number of correlated input variables. Several statistical regression methods were fitted to a dataset including 689 observations of winter oilseed rape yield from replicated field experiments conducted in 239 sites in Denmark, covering nearly all regions of the country from 1992 to 2013. Regression methods were compared by cross-validation. The regression methods leading to the most accurate yield predictions were Lasso and Elastic Net, and the least accurate methods were ordinary least squares and stepwise regression. Partial least squares and ridge regression methods gave intermediate results. The estimated relative yield change for a +1Â°C temperature increase during flowering was estimated to range between 0 and +6 %, depending on choice of regression method. Precipitation was found to have an adverse effect on yield during autumn and winter. It was estimated that an increase in precipitation of +1 mm/day would result in a relative yield change ranging from 0 to âˆ’4 %. Soil type was also important for crop yields with lower yields on sandy soils compared to loamy soils. Later sowing was found to result in increased crop yield. The estimated effect of climate on yield was highly sensitive to the chosen regression method. Regression models showing similar performance led in some cases to different conclusions with respect to effect of temperature and precipitation. Hence, it is recommended to apply an ensemble of regression models, in order to account for the sensitivity of the data driven models for projecting crop yield under climate change.",2017,European Journal of Agronomy
"Thalassorheology, organic matter and plankton: towards a more viscous approach in plankton ecology","Rheology is the study of how materials deform, particularly those materials not conforming to ideal solid or ideal liquid models. This is the case for much ocean water, due largely to the presence of organic exopolymeric substances, including mucilage, derived mostly from phytoplankton and bacterioplankton. This material makes the water more viscous and gives it elasticity. Thalassorheology concerns the rheology of seawater and other natural waters. Ocean scientists and rheologists generally know little of each other's work. The aim of this paper is to show that collaboration would be beneficial to modelling the oceans, and to guide the formation of interdisciplinary teams, and a working has been formed for this purpose.",2015,Journal of Plankton Research

Sparsity Controlled Random Multiple Access With Compressed Sensing,"This paper considers random multiple access in a network where only a small portion of users have data to forward and transmit packets in each time slot because the user activity ratio is not high in practice. For this reason, the access point (AP) has to not only identify the users who transmitted but also decode the received data codewords. Exploiting the sparsity of transmitting users, Lasso, which is a well-known practical compressed sensing algorithm, is applied for efficient user identification. The compressed sensing algorithm enables the AP to handle more users than the conventional random multiple access schemes do. We develop distributed scheduling methods for maximizing the system sum throughput, and we analyze the corresponding optimal throughput for three different cases of channel knowledge, i.e., the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), the channel state information at the receiver (CSIR), and the imperfect channel state information at the receiver (ImCSIR). We also derive the closed-form expressions of asymptotically optimal scheduling parameters and the corresponding maximum sum throughput for each CSI assumption. The results show the effects of system parameters on the sum throughput and provide useful insights on using compressed sensing for throughput maximization in random multiple access schemes.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications
[The percutaneous treatment of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum].,"OBJECTIVE
Describe a mechanical method of perforation-dilatation of the pulmonary valve in pulmonary atresia with intact interventricular septum (PA-IVS), with or without stenting the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and medium-term results.


METHOD
Since 2007, all patients with PA-IVS and a right ventricle adequate for biventricular repair, benefited from a transcatheter attempt to perforate-dilate the valve with or without stenting the PDA, and were included in this retrospective study.


TECHNIQUE
A catheter was percutaneously introduced through the femoral vein and positionned in front of the atretic pulmonary valve. A lasso catheter was introduced through the femoral artery to the other side of the pulmonary valve. The tip of a rigid guidewire was then pushed through the atretic valve and taken with the lasso, creating a loop that allowed for balloon valvuloplasty. If the child remained ductal dependant following PGE1 withdrawal, a stent is placed in the ductus arteriosus.


RESULTS
Five patients were included in this series. Four patients were successfully dilated, and two patients necessitated stents. The procedure had to be interrupted in one patient.

One patient with a patent stent was operated at the age of one year and died in the postoperative period. The other patient with a stent is now 16 months old with a patent stent and an oxygen saturation of 98%. The two remaining patients without stent are now 3- and 18-month-old with oxygen saturation of 85% and 96% respectively.


CONCLUSION
The percutaneous treatment of PA-IVS is feasible and avoids early high risk surgery. Stenting the ductus arteriosus may replace a Blalock shunt. However, the prognosis is still related to the severity of the anomaly.",2012,Le Journal medical libanais. The Lebanese medical journal
Perturbation Bootstrap in Adaptive Lasso,"The Adaptive Lasso(Alasso) was proposed by Zou [\textit{J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. \textbf{101} (2006) 1418-1429}] as a modification of the Lasso for the purpose of simultaneous variable selection and estimation of the parameters in a linear regression model. Zou (2006) established that the Alasso estimator is variable-selection consistent as well as asymptotically Normal in the indices corresponding to the nonzero regression coefficients in certain fixed-dimensional settings. In an influential paper, Minnier, Tian and Cai [\textit{J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. \textbf{106} (2011) 1371-1382}] proposed a perturbation bootstrap method and established its distributional consistency for the Alasso estimator in the fixed-dimensional setting. In this paper, however, we show that this (naive) perturbation bootstrap fails to achieve second order correctness in approximating the distribution of the Alasso estimator. We propose a modification to the perturbation bootstrap objective function and show that a suitably studentized version of our modified perturbation bootstrap Alasso estimator achieves second-order correctness even when the dimension of the model is allowed to grow to infinity with the sample size. As a consequence, inferences based on the modified perturbation bootstrap will be more accurate than the inferences based on the oracle Normal approximation. We give simulation studies demonstrating good finite-sample properties of our modified perturbation bootstrap method as well as an illustration of our method on a real data set.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
ASSOCIATION FOR ACADEMIC SURGERY Treadmill Injuries in the Pediatric Population,"Background. Exercise equipment such as treadmills are becoming commonplace in residential homes, placing small children at risk for injury. These injuries can be severe and may require surgical intervention. While it is our clinical perception that these injuries are on the rise, they remain largely unreported in the literature. Therefore, we reviewed our experience to evaluate the incidence and outcomes of treadmillassociated injuries in children. Methods. After receiving exempt IRB approval, we retrospectively reviewed all patients who sustained treadmill-related injuries that required evaluation by a surgeon from July 2005 to February 2010. Data collected included patient demographics, injury details, injury management, and outcomes. Results. We identified 19 children who required treatment for treadmill-related injuries. Mean age at injury was 4.1 y (1.3â€10.5 y), and 63% were male. The treadmill was in use by another person in 17 cases (89%). The hand was involved in 79%. All burns were <10% body surface area and 18 (90%) were <5 %. Admission was required in two cases, and four (21%) children required skin grafting. Healing was complicated by hypertrophic scarring in four patients (21%). Mean length of active therapy was 9.2 Â± 7.0 d and involved a mean of 6.0 Â± 3.5 healthcare visits. Mean hospital charges were $5700. Conclusion. Treadmill-related burn injuries in children are preventable injuries that can pose a substantial burden on patients and families. Supervision is paramount in prevention of these injuries, and strategies should include child safety features in equipment designs along with consumer awareness. 2011 Elsevier",2011,
Phylogenetic and ecological inference of three Halichoeres (Perciformes: Labridae) species through geometric morphometrics,"A study of geometric morphometrics was carried out based on 109 specimens of four Labridae species captured in north-eastern Brazil. The canonical variable analysis applied on the W Matrix discriminated the species, and the partial warps analysis located the morphological variations. According to analysis, the Halichoeres species constitute a monophyletic group, with H. poeyi as the sister-group of the clade H. brasiliensis + H. dimidiatus. The cladogram of these species was estimated using Bodianus rufus as outgroup. The Halichoeres species share shorter head lengths and deeper heads in relation to the outgroup. Within Halichoeres, the more basal taxon (H. poeyi) can be characterized by autapomorphies such as short snout and deeper head. in the clade H. brasiliensis + H. dimidiatus, the snout is longer and the caudal peduncle is deeper than in H. poeyi. The results obtained from the geometric morphometry are consistent with works of functional morphology and their applications for the testing of phylogenetic hypotheses are equally satisfactory. However, caution is necessary because the similarities in morphometric data can reflect non-homologous and convergent features due to ecological roles, without representing kinships. RÃ‰SUMÃ‰. infÃ©rence phylogÃ©nÃ©tique et Ã©cologique de trois Halichoeres (Perciformes : Labridae) par morphomÃ©trie gÃ©omÃ©trique. une Ã©tude de morphomÃ©trie gÃ©omÃ©trique a Ã©tÃ© conduite sur 109 spÃ©cimens de 4 espÃ¨ces de Labridae capturÃ©s dans le nord-est du BrÃ©sil. Lâ€™analyse variable canonique appliquÃ©e sur la matrice W a discriminÃ© les espÃ¨ces et les analyses des flexions partielles ont mis en Ã©vidence les variations morphologiques. Dâ€™aprÃ¨s les analyses, les espÃ¨ces dâ€™Halichoeres forment un groupe monophylÃ©tique, H. poeyi Ã©tant le groupe sÅ“ur du clade H. brasiliensis + H. dimidiatus. Le cladogramme de ces espÃ¨ces a Ã©tÃ© construit en utilisant Bodianus rufus comme groupe externe. Les espÃ¨ces dâ€™Halichoeres se diffÃ©rencient par des tÃªtes Ã  la fois plus courtes et plus hautes par rapport au groupe externe. Au sein des Halichoeres, le taxon le plus basal (H. poeyi) peut Ãªtre (grossiÃ¨rement) dÃ©fini par des autapomorphies telles un museau court et une tÃªte plus haute.

[betharau@terra.com.br] Fourteen Labridae species divided into six genera, namely Bodianus, Clepticus, Doratonotus, Halichoeres, Thalassoma and Xyrichtys (Floeter et al., 2003), occur in Brazil, with Bodianus comprising three species and Halichoeres six species (Moura et al., 2003). Halichoeres is the most species-rich genus in the family Labridae, with nearly 75 species (Parenti and randall, 2000). Although usually considered as polyphyletic (Gomon, 1997; Westneat and Alfaro, 2005; Barber and Bellwood, 2005), this genus comprises lineages found in the Caribbean, South America and east Pacific that form monophyletic groups (Westneat and Alfaro, 2005; Barber and Bellwood, 2005). The use of genetic tools associated with ecological and/ or biomechanical information has increased the knowledge of relationships into the family (rocha, 2004; Westneat et al., 2005). Furthermore, ecological investigations concerning behavioural patterns may be used as a source of important information for the establishment of the phylogenetic relationships of fish, as is the case for studies performed with the wrasse tribe Labrini involving parental care analysis (Hanel et al., 2002) and with the colour pattern in cleaning behaviour (Arnal et al., 2006). in the same way, information generated by morphometric studies may be used in the elaboration of phylogenetic hypotheses (rohlf, 1990; Peres-Neto, 1995) through the interpretation of ecological aspects of the organisms and their characteristics concerning feeding biology, habitat use, selective pressure and competition (Peres-Neto, 1995). Geometric morphometrics of Halichoeres NuNes et al. 166 Cybium 2008, 32(2) Many devices have been created from computational increments and the raise of mathematical applications in biological studies (molecular biology, embryology and phylogeny) (rohlf and Marcus, 1993; Monteiro and reis, 1999), spreading the use of morphometric data. Geometric morphometry consists of a descriptive tool that reveals with greater detail and precision the changes and variations in body shape based on homologous anatomical markings, generally used in evolutionary and ontogenetic development studies (Strauss and Bookstein, 1982; Cavalcanti et al., 1999; Monteiro and reis, 1999; roth and Mercer, 2000). opinions among researchers are divided concerning the validity of application of data resultant from morphometric techniques in phylogenetical studies. Those that believe in the validity of this application defend the use of the ThinPlate Splines (TPS) method, which possesses mechanisms that allow the definition of anatomical markings as homologous characters. even admitting that the greatest challenge would be the codification of the quantitative data, Fink and zelditch (1995) and Swiderski et al. (1998, 2000) consider that the TPS method can overcome this difficulty. The party contrary to the use of geometric morphometric techniques in phylogenetical issues presents the theoretical problems in mathematical bases as the greatest impediment (Adams and rosenberg, 1998; rohlf, 1998a), besides the real problem of the tridimensionality of the animals (Monteiro, 2000). recently, Acero et al. (2005) applied the geometric morphometric techniques using the TPS method to infer the phylogenetic relationships of Siluriformes from both American coasts; the morphometric data sustained the phylogenetic relationships between the four Bagre species. Therefore, the present work studies three species morphologically, namely Halichoeres brasiliensis (Bloch, 1791), H. dimidiatus (Agassiz, in Spix and Agassiz, 1831) and H. poeyi (Steindachner, 1867), using geometric morphometric techniques, and analyses the use of these techniques in the inference of phylogenetic relationships and in the ecology of these species, using Bodianus rufus (Linnaeus, 1758) as extra group. MATERIAL AND METHODS The studied specimens were collected in the beaches and coastal reefs of itamaracÃ¡, Serrambi and TamandarÃ©, all municipalities of the State of Pernambuco, Brazil. A total of 109 individuals belonging to family Labridae were measured. The number of individuals (n) and variation in standard length for each collected species were: Bodianus rufus, n = 27, 174.3-257.8 mm; Halichoeres brasiliensis, n = 22, 120.0-222.8 mm; Halichoeres dimidiatus , n = 32, 190.7-232.4 mm; Halichoeres poeyi, n = 28, 54.0-106.0 mm. The examined specimens were selected according to size in order to avoid problems with ontogenetic dimorphisms, and were deposited in the Necton Collection of the oceanography department of the Federal university of Pernambuco. The morphometric data were obtained from 13 anatomical markings fixed upon the left side of the animals, based on homologous points (Strauss and Bookstein, 1982; Cavalcanti et al., 1999; Piorski and Nunes, 2001). The adopted anatomical markings correspond to the following structures: 1) snout tip; 2) left orbit; 3) superior portion of skull vertically aligned with the orbit; 4) inferior portion of the skull vertically aligned with the orbit; 5) origin of the pectoral fin; 6) origin of the dorsal fin; 7) base of pelvic fin; 8); base of the first ray of the anal fin; 9) posterior base of the anal fin; 10) posterior base of the dorsal fin; 11) base of the first ray of the superior lobe of the caudal fin; 12) inferior portion of the caudal peduncle vertically aligned with marking 11; 13) point in the base of the dorsal fin vertically aligned with the point in the base of the dorsal fin, vertically aligned with the origin of the anal fin (Fig. 1). The specimens were photographed individually using a Sony Cyber-shot dSC-S40 digital camera, and the photographs were stored in Jpeg format with the same 1.0 Megapixel resolution and resized to 640X480 in the program Adobe Photoshop. each anatomical marking was transformed into Cartesian coordinates using the program TPSdigit v.2.04, in order to establish a numerical matrix (rohlf, 1998b, 2005; Piorski and Nunes, 2001). The study of the geometric morphometrics of Labridae began with the alignment of all anatomical landmarks in order to produce a reference configuration (rohlf et al., 1996), which represents the average of the coordinates from these landmarks (Piorski and Nunes, 2001; Moraes, 2003). From this point on, the iMP (integraded Morphometrics Package) software was used for the warp analyses, since it is a program that gathers all the TPS warp analyses (Sheets, 2002). Next, a matrix was constructed with all the distances between the original coordinates and those generat",2008,

"The Taxonomic Status of Fig Shells, with Notes on Ficus Variegata (rÃ¶ding, 1798) (mollusca: Gastropoda: Ficoidea: Ficidae)","The family Ficidae (fig shells) is the only known member in the superfamily Ficoidea (Meek, 1864). Although fig shells are closely related to the Tonnidae (tun shells), their shell shape distinguishes them apart (Verhaeghe & Poppe, 2000), hence they are placed in a separate superfamily Ficoidea. To date, there are 12 known species of Ficus (Roding, 1798) and one species of Thalassocyon (Barnard, 1960) within the Ficidae (Beesley et al., 1998; Liu & Wang, 1999). With numerous synonyms created for this genus (Table 1), the nomenclatural history of the Ficidae has been complex (Boss, 1982; Verhaeghe & Poppe, 2000). In earlier literature such as Rogers (1908), and Thiele (1935), the oldest available synonym for fig shells was Pyrulidae (Swainson, 1840). However, the valid name used in this paper is Ficidae, as suggested by Verhaeghe & Poppe (2000) citing the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) Article 40b as reference. According to Chuang (1973: 191, 196), an occasional Ficus ficus (Lamarck, 1758) could be found in the deep sand off the southeast part of Singapore. There were also recent local sightings of live Ficus variegata (Roding, 1798) on the shores of Singapore. Upon examination of the fig shell collections from the Zoological Reference Collection (ZRC) of the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity and Research (RMBR), National University of Singapore, together with further reading of the literature, taxonomic information of fig shells was generally disorganised and ambiguous. Hence, the current state of taxonomic nomenclature among some of the Ficus species is discussed in this paper.",2010,
Multi-view Clustering with Incomplete Views,"In this paper, we propose an online multi-view clustering algorithm, OMVC, which deals with large-scale incomplete views. We model the multi-view clustering problem as a joint weighted NMF problem and process the multi-view data chunk by chunk to reduce the memory requirement. OMVC learns the latent feature matrices for all the views and pushes them towards a consensus. We further increase the robustness of the learned latent feature matrices in OMVC via lasso regularization. To minimize the influence of incompleteness, dynamic weight setting is introduced to give lower weights to the incoming missing instances in different views. More importantly, to reduce the computational time, we incorporate a faster projected gradient descent by utilizing the Hessian matrices in OMVC. Extensive experiments conducted on four real data demonstrate the effectiveness of OMVC. Keywords-Multi-view clustering; Online algorithm; Incomplete views; Nonnegative matrix factorization",2016,
Development and reliability of metrics to characterize types and sources of stigma among men who have sex with men and female sex workers in Togo and Burkina Faso,"BackgroundStigma is a multifaceted concept that potentiates Human Immunodeficiency Virus and sexually transmitted infection acquisition and transmission risks among key populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM) and female sex workers (FSW). Despite extensive stigma literature, limited research has characterized the types and sources of stigma reported by key populations in Sub-Saharan Africa.MethodsThis study leveraged data collected from 1356 MSM and 1383 FSW in Togo and Burkina Faso, recruited via respondent-driven sampling. Participants completed a survey instrument including stigma items developed through systematic reviews and synthesis of existing metrics. Using exploratory factor analysis with promax oblique rotation, 16 items were retained in a stigma metric for MSM and 20 in an FSW stigma metric. To assess the measuresâ€™ convergent validity, their correlations with expected variables were examined through bivariate logistic regression models.ResultsOne factor, experienced stigma, included actions that were carried out by multiple types of perpetrators and included being arrested, verbally harassed, blackmailed, physically abused, tortured, or forced to have sex. Other factors were differentiated by source of stigma including healthcare workers, family and friends, or police. Specifically, stigma from healthcare workers loaded on two factors: experienced healthcare stigma included being denied care, not treated well, or gossiped about by healthcare workers and anticipated healthcare stigma included fear of or avoiding seeking healthcare. Stigma from family and friends included feeling excluded from family gatherings, gossiped about by family, or rejected by friends. Stigma from police included being refused police protection and items related to police confiscation of condoms. The Cronbachâ€™s alpha ranged from 0.71â€“0.82. Median stigma scores, created for each participant by summing the number of affirmative responses to each stigma item, among MSM were highest in Ouagadougou and among FSW were highest in both Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. Validation analyses demonstrated higher stigma was generally significantly associated with suicidal ideation, disclosure of involvement in sex work or same-sex practices, and involvement in organizations for MSM or FSW.ConclusionsTaken together, these data suggest promising reliability and validity of metrics for measuring stigma affecting MSM and FSW in multiple urban centers across West Africa.",2019,BMC Infectious Diseases
Hybrid graphical least square estimation and its application in portfolio selection,"This paper proposes a new regression method based on the idea of graphical models to deal with regression problems with the number of covariates v larger than the sample size N. Unlike the regularization methods such as ridge regression, LASSO and LARS, which always give biased estimates for all parameters, the proposed method can give unbiased estimates for important parameters (a certain subset of all parameters). The new method is applied to a portfolio selection problem under the linear regression framework and, compared to other existing methods, it can assist in improving the portfolio performance by increasing its expected return and decreasing its risk. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it constructs a non-sparse (saturated) portfolio, which is more diversiï¬ed in terms of stocks and reduces the stock-speciï¬c risk. Overall, four simulation studies and a real data analysis from London Stock Exchange showed that our method outperforms other existing regression methods when N < v.",2019,Statistics and Its Interface
Statistical Analyses of High Dimensional MicroRNA Data in Relation to Incidence and Survival After Cancer,"Pancreatic cancer is globally the 4 most common cause of cancer death and the overall 5-year survival rate among patients is less than 5%. Often the pancreatic cancer is already at advance stages when discovered, so the difficulties of an early diagnosis makes the life prognosis for these patients very dismal. Part of the problem with detecting this type of cancer in time, is that there are no typical symptoms. Incidence and prognosis prediction from high dimensional gene expression data have been subject to much research during recent years. This thesis examines the relationship between microRNA expression profiles and their ability to predict correct diagnostics and expected survival from time of operation. This research area can hopefully reform future courses of treatment by providing patients with pancreatic cancer earlier diagnosis, and thus improve their prognosis. This thesis deals with the statistical modelling of microRNA measurements from serum samples of both pancreatic patients and healthy controls. The analyses are divided into two parts. The incidence part focuses on the logistic model for predicting a binary outcome and the prognostic part considers Coxâ€™s proportional hazards model in order to handle censored survival times. However since parsimonious models are of clinical relevance, these models are used in combination with coefficient shrinkage techniques, where the shrinkage methods used here are univariate selection, backwards stepwise selection, Ridge regression, Lasso regression and nÃ¤Ä±ve elastic net regression. These shrinkage methods require estimation of penalty parameters for which cross-validation have served as an excellent tool.",2012,
Online Hyperparameter-Free Sparse Estimation Method,"In this paper, we derive an online estimator for sparse parameter vectors which, unlike the LASSO approach, does not require the tuning of any hyperparameters. The algorithm is based on a covariance matching approach and is equivalent to a weighted version of the square-root LASSO. The computational complexity of the estimator is of the same order as that of the online versions of regularized least-squares (RLS) and LASSO. We provide a numerical comparison with feasible and infeasible implementations of the LASSO and RLS to illustrate the advantage of the proposed online hyperparameter-free estimator.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
The demography and life history strategies of timber elephants in Myanmar.,"Although the Union of Myanmar is home to the second largest population of Asian elephants {lcub}Elephas maximus) in the world, the demography of its captive elephant population has never been studied before in any detail. Life history data analyzed in this thesis are taken from the records and reports archived and maintained by Myanma Timber Enterprise, which is under the charge of the Ministry of Forestry, the Government of the Union of Myanmar. The study population contains 5292 individually identified captive timber elephants, which were born or captured between 1952 and 2000. In this thesis, birth origins of timber elephants are referred to as wild-caught and captive-born. Life-table analysis indicates that the captive-born section of the population should be self-sustaining, but that the demographic rates seen in the wild-caught section would not be sufficient to maintain a stable a population. I extend my analysis by conducting detailed survival analyses. Males have a higher mortality than females throughout the age range. In adults, wild-caught elephants suffered significantly higher mortality than captive- bom elephants, and their mortality differed by capture methods. Elephants captured by immobilization showed the lowest survival rate when compared with elephants captured by either milarshikar (lasso or noose) or stockade. Regarding the causes of mortality. I document that accidents and agalactia of mothers were the primary causes of death in calves, while malnutrition and accidents were the main causes in adults. Exploring reproductive patterns and maternal investment. I find that elephant mothers do not adapt their offspring sex ratio, and that reproductive fitness is lower in wild-caught females than captive-born females. Lastly. I explore how the process of increasing time in captivity influences survival probabilities and reproductive potential in captive elephants, both within individuals and between generations. I report that capture stress causes measurable reductions in survival and fecundity rates up to 12 years after capture, as well as reducing the survivorship of calves born to captured females. To achieve a self-sustaining population of captive timber elephants in Myanmar without the need for further capture from the wild. I recommended that Myanma Timber Enterprise re-evaluates elephant management strategies, aiming to improving both the fecundity and surv ival of captive elephants in all age groups.",2002,
DNA methylation levels in candidate genes associated with chronological age in mammals are not conserved in a long-lived seabird,"Most seabirds do not have any outward identifiers of their chronological age, so estimation of seabird population age structure generally requires expensive, long-term banding studies. We investigated the potential to use a molecular age biomarker to estimate age in short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris). We quantified DNA methylation in several A. tenuirostris genes that have shown age-related methylation changes in mammals. In birds ranging from chicks to 21 years of age, bisulphite treated blood and feather DNA was sequenced and methylation levels analysed in 67 CpG sites in 13 target gene regions. From blood samples, five of the top relationships with age were identified in KCNC3 loci (CpG66: R2 = 0.325, p = 0.019). In feather samples ELOVL2 (CpG42: R2 = 0.285, p = 0.00048) and EDARADD (CpG46: R2 = 0.168, p = 0.0067) were also weakly correlated with age. However, the majority of markers had no clear association with age (of 131 comparisons only 12 had a p-value < 0.05) and statistical analysis using a penalised lasso approach did not produce an accurate ageing model. Our data indicate that some age-related signatures identified in orthologous mammalian genes are not conserved in the long-lived short tailed shearwater. Alternative molecular approaches will be required to identify a reliable biomarker of chronological age in these seabirds.",2017,PLoS ONE
Zum systematischen erbe der klassischen deutschen philosophie in der transzendentalen phÃ¤nomenologie (unter besonderer berÃ¼cksichtigung des realitÃ¤tsbegriffs,"In this paper, I focus on the link between Husserl and Classical German Philosophy on the concept of reality. The aim of my study is this: explore the phenomenological concept of reality and strengthen the phenomenological standpoint within the contemporary discussion about Â«realismÂ». After trying to outline a general characterization of Â«realityÂ», I extract the core question of Kantâ€™s approach of this perspective, namely: how is it possible to legitimate the possibility of reality thanks to a priori forms of understanding? The phenomenological answer is prepared by developing the very essence of Fichteâ€™s and Schellingâ€™s discussion on transcendental idealism, on the one hand, and a response to Meillassouxâ€™s critique of Â«correlationismÂ», on the other. The heart of my demonstration consists then in the attempt to show that the transcendental constitution of reality â€” that entails a Â«new ontologyÂ» (Levinas), characterized both by the Â«constitution of consciousnessÂ» and the Â«foundation of beingÂ» â€” leans on Husserlâ€™s conception of truth, and especially on the link between the determination of reality and the apprehension of truth. Furthermore, it brings into play a mediation in which the real determinations of the constituted being have themselves an effect on this transcendental constitution; and it implies that the legitimation of this mediation is based on a transcendental (Â«reflexibleÂ») reduplication that makes the possibilisation itself possible. Thus, the concept of reality contains a legitimation of necessity that recurs both to Schelling and to Fichte (whose influences on Husserlâ€™s phenomenology are obviously systematical rather than historical).",2015,
"Sporopollen Assemblage from the Totohe Formation and Its Stratigraphic Significance in the Tanggula Mountains,Northern Tibet","The Cenozoic fluvial redbeds are widely exposed in the Tanggula mountains. Dating these!redbeds can provide very important data for understanding the geological history of the Tibetan plateau. The sporopollen assemblage found from the upper part of the Totohe formation are characterized by the dominace of angiospermous pollen,most of the sporopollens being the common elements of Paleogene. Among the angiospermous pollen, there are plenty of tricolpate and tricolporate pollen grains of various kind, mainly including Quercoidites(especially Q. minutus, Q. microhenrici), Meliaceoidites, Pokrovskaja, and Tricolporopollenites, etc., and the porate pollen is very low in quantity. There is a small amount of herbaceous pollen, such as Scabiosapollis, Labitricolpites, Randiapollis, and Tubulifloridites, as well as sporadic old pollen in these assemblages, such as Classopollis, Pentapollenites, and Jianghanpollis. The quantity of gymnospermous pollen is not high, and the pteridophyte spore is sporadic in the assemblage. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of the sporopollen assemblages, we conclude that the geological age of the upper part of the Totohe Formation is middle and late Eocene, which can provide new basis for further improvement of the Cenozoic stratigraphic system in the Tanggula mountains, northern Tibet.",2007,
Fused Lasso Additive Model.,"We consider the problem of predicting an outcome variable using p covariates that are measured on n independent observations, in a setting in which additive, flexible, and interpretable fits are desired. We propose the fused lasso additive model (FLAM), in which each additive function is estimated to be piecewise constant with a small number of adaptively-chosen knots. FLAM is the solution to a convex optimization problem, for which a simple algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a global optimum is provided. FLAM is shown to be consistent in high dimensions, and an unbiased estimator of its degrees of freedom is proposed. We evaluate the performance of FLAM in a simulation study and on two data sets.

Evaluation of Lymph Node Metastasis in Advanced Gastric Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Radiomics,"Objective: To develop and evaluate a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-based radiomic nomogram for lymph node metastasis (LNM) prediction in advanced gastric cancer (AGC) patients. Overall Study: This retrospective study was conducted with 146 consecutively included pathologically confirmed AGC patients from two centers. All patients underwent preoperative 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. The dataset was allocated to a training cohort (n = 71) and an internal validation cohort (n = 47) from one center along with an external validation cohort (n = 28) from another. A summary of 1,305 radiomic features were extracted per patient. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression and learning vector quantization (LVQ) methods with cross-validations were adopted to select significant features in a radiomic signature. Combining the radiomic signature and independent clinical factors, a radiomic nomogram was established. The MRI-reported N staging and the MRI-derived model were built for comparison. Model performance was evaluated considering receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: A two-feature radiomic signature was found significantly associated with LNM (p < 0.01, training and internal validation cohorts). A radiomic nomogram was established by incorporating the clinical minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and MRI-reported N staging. The radiomic nomogram showed a favorable classification ability with an area under ROC curve of 0.850 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.758-0.942] in the training cohort, which was then confirmed with an AUC of 0.857 (95% CI, 0.714-1.000) in internal validation cohort and 0.878 (95% CI, 0.696-1.000) in external validation cohort. Meanwhile, the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy were 0.846, 0.853, and 0.851 in internal validation cohort, and 0.714, 0.952, and 0.893 in external validation cohort, compensating for the MRI-reported N staging and MRI-derived model. DCA demonstrated good clinical use of radiomic nomogram.

Safe optimization algorithms for variable selection and hyperparameter tuning,"Massive and automatic data processing requires the development of techniques able to filter the most important information. Among these methods, those with sparse structures have been shown to improve the statistical and computational efficiency of estimators in a context of large dimension. They can often be expressed as a solution of regularized empirical risk minimization and generally lead to non differentiable optimization problems in the form of a sum of a smooth term, measuring the quality of the fit, and a non-smooth term, penalizing complex solutions. Although it has considerable advantages, such a way of including prior information, unfortunately introduces many numerical difficulties both for solving the underlying optimization problem and to calibrate the level of regularization. Solving these issues has been at the heart of this thesis. A recently introduced technique, called ""Screening Rules"", proposes to ignore some variables during the optimization process by benefiting from the expected sparsity of the solutions. These elimination rules are said to be safe when the procedure guarantees to not reject any variable wrongly. In this work, we propose a unified framework for identifying important structures in these convex optimization problems and we introduce the ""Gap Safe Screening Rules"". They allows to obtain significant gains in computational time thanks to the dimensionality reduction induced by this method. In addition, they can be easily inserted into iterative algorithms and apply to a large number of problems.To find a good compromise between minimizing risk and introducing a learning bias, (exact) homotopy continuation algorithms offer the possibility of tracking the curve of the solutions as a function of the regularization parameters. However, they exhibit numerical instabilities due to several matrix inversions and are often expensive in large dimension. Another weakness is that a worst-case analysis shows that they have exact complexities that are exponential in the dimension of the model parameter. Allowing approximated solutions makes possible to circumvent the aforementioned drawbacks by approximating the curve of the solutions. In this thesis, we revisit the approximation techniques of the regularization paths given a predefined tolerance and we propose an in-depth analysis of their complexity w.r.t. the regularity of the loss functions involved. Hence, we propose optimal algorithms as well as various strategies for exploring the parameters space. We also provide calibration method (for the regularization parameter) that enjoys globalconvergence guarantees for the minimization of the empirical risk on the validation data.Among sparse regularization methods, the Lasso is one of the most celebrated and studied. Its statistical theory suggests choosing the level of regularization according to the amount of variance in the observations, which is difficult to use in practice because the variance of the model is oftenan unknown quantity. In such case, it is possible to jointly optimize the regression parameter as well as the level of noise. These concomitant estimates, appeared in the literature under the names of Scaled Lasso or Square-Root Lasso, and provide theoretical results as sharp as that of theLasso while being independent of the actual noise level of the observations. Although presenting important advances, these methods are numerically unstable and the currently available algorithms are expensive in computation time. We illustrate these difficulties and we propose modifications based on smoothing techniques to increase stability of these estimators as well as to introduce a faster algorithm.",2018,
Novel potential peptide therapeutics for tuberculosis therapy,"Despite the existence of vaccinations, diagnostic tools and treatments, tuberculosis 
(TB) prevalence is increasing because of the circulation of people and misuse of 
antibiotics, giving rise to growing numbers of drug resistant strains of 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There is therefore a pressing need to look for new 
strategies against TB, in the hope of finding new drugs with novel mechanisms of 
anti-tubercular action or ways to potentiate the activity of already existing drugs and 
reduce treatment duration. 
This thesis explores the employment of peptides in anti-tuberculosis therapy. The 
project was initiated by the identification of a novel therapeutic target in M. 
tuberculosis: murein peptide ligase (Mpl, Rv3712), an enzyme involved in the 
bacterial peptidoglycan recycling process. The aim is to synthesise its putative 
natural substrates (peptidoglycan peptide fragments) to characterise its activity and 
synthesise sequence analogues. These analogues were tested on the whole-cell 
and will be evaluated for inhibitory activity on the recombinant Mpl enzyme and 
eventually could be used in combination with existing or new drugs to see whether 
they increase anti-tubercular potency and thus combat resistance. Attainment of the 
putative substrate required the synthesis of mDAP, an unusual amino acid unique to 
peptidoglycan. Its synthesis was successfully completed and it was incorporated in 
the tripeptide Mpl putative substrate. 
Solid-phase synthesis has been used successfully and proved effective for rapid 
synthesis of multiple short peptide analogues in parallel. In addition it was used to 
synthesise anti-tuberculosis lasso peptides, lariatins A and B, lassomycin and 
analogues, to evaluate the structural requirements for biological activity. 
The method for the heterologous expression and purification of recombinant Mpl 
from M. tuberculosis has been confirmed as successful, and the enzyme is available 
for future target-based evaluation using the synthesised mDAP-containing tripeptide 
and eventually for other mDAP-containing PG fragments and analogues.",2017,

The existence of solutions of quasilinear elliptic equations with change of sign,"Abstract This paper considers the following quasilinear elliptic problem
 { âˆ’ div ( | âˆ‡ u | p âˆ’ 2 âˆ‡ u ) = a ( x ) g ( u ) in Î© u = 0 on âˆ‚ Î© where Î© is a bounded regular domain in R N ( N â‰¥ 3 ) , N > p > 1 .

The authors prove the existence of a nonnegative nontrivial solution for N > p > 1 , in particular, the existence of a positive solution to the problem for N > pâ‰¥ 2. Our main theorem generalizes a recent result of Samia Khanfir and Leila Lassoued (see [1]) concerning the case where p = 2.

Robust variable selection in modal varying-coefficient models with longitudinal,"In this article we present a robust and efficient variable selection procedure by using modal regression for varying-coefficient models with longitudinal data. The new method is proposed based on basis function approximations and a group version of the adaptive LASSO penalty, which can select significant variables and estimate the non-zero smooth coefficient functions simultaneously. Under suitable conditions, we establish the consistency in variable selection and the oracle property in estimation. A simulation study and two real data examples are undertaken to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed variable selection procedure.",2015,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation
On Mixture Regression Shrinkage and Selection Via the MR-Lasso,"In finite mixture regression models, we generalize the application of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to obtain MR-Lasso, which incorporates both mixture and regression penalties. Because MR-Lasso jointly penalizes both regression coeficients and mixture components, it enables simultaneous identification of significant variables and determination of important mixture components. Simulation studies indicate that MR-Lasso outperforms LASSO. Extensions to mixture non-Gaussian and mixture time series models are briefly described.",2008,
"Chance Correlation in Variable Subset Regression: Influence of the Objective Function, the Selection Mechanism, and Ensemble Averaging","Cross-validation is often used to guide variable selection algorithms. While cross-validation almost unbiasedly estimates the prediction error when no model selection (such as variable selection) is involved, it is heavily biased when a large amount of model selection is applied (i.e. sifting through thousands of models). In the latter case, the internal figures of merit such as R 2 C V or RMSEP C V can be deceptively overoptimistic. The extent of this inflation (overoptimism) and the influence factors for the degree of inflation are studied here. It turns out, that the extent of inflation is extremely large for small data sets. The main influence factors for the degree of inflation are data set size, the size of the variable pool, the allowed object variable ratio, the objective function for guiding an stepwise selection technique, and the correlation structure of the data matrix. Moreover, changing the selection mechanism from the commonly applied stepwise procedures to the more stable shrinking and selection technique LASSO eliminates the inflation largely. No inflation is observed when ensemble averaging is used to estimate the prediction error. The latter property combined with the potential of ensemble averaging to improve the predictivity and the possibility to use the information of the single models of the ensemble for validation tasks, renders ensemble averaging an attractive tool if prediction is the primary goal of the analysis.",2005,Qsar & Combinatorial Science
Mechanical modelling of ductile fracture,"Mechanical models of material failure by void growth to coalescence are described to give a brief overview of methods applied in the analysis of ductile fracture. Approximate constitutive relations for porous ductile materials are discussed, modelling both the nucleation and growth of voids. The application of the material models is illustrated by numerical analyses for a tensile test specimen and for dynamic, ductile crack growth. Unstable void growth is a relevant mechanism in ductile materials subject to a high level of triaxial tension. The analysis of such cavitation instabilities in elastic-perfectly plastic materials is discussed for axisymmetric stress states, and the relevance to metal/ceramic components is emphasized.SommarioVengono descritti i modelli meccanici di collasso dei materiali a cause di coalescenza per crescita dei vuoti e si passano brevemente in rassegna i metodi applicati all'analisi della frattura duttile.

L'applicazione dei modelli di materiale viene illustrata mediante analisi numerica di una prova di trazione e di una crescita dinamica di una cricca duttile. La crescita instabile dei vuoti Ã© un significativo meccanismo nei materiali duttili soggetti ad un alto livello di tensione triassiale: si discute di queste instabilitÃ  di cavitazione in materiali elasticiperfettamente plastici per stati tensionali assial-simmetrici e se ne sottolinea la rilevanza per componenti metalloceramici.",1991,Meccanica
Visualizing Endocrinology in the Classroom,"As science educators, we are continually searching for new, innovative experiments that foster the development of critical thinking skills. The literature indicates that inquiry-based learning via hands-on experimentation motivates students in the sciences to think more critically and this results in improved comprehension (George et al. 1996; Glasson & McKenzie 1997). In the field of endocrinology, there appears to be a real need for experiments that involve critical and analytical thinking through hands-on experimentation to illustrate important aspects of hormone action. This report describes an inquiry-based laboratory experiment that examines the effects of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (aMSH) on skin pigmentation in Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog). This laboratory experiment is unique because students are able to observe oLMSH stimulating the darkening of skin pigmentation in the classroom. In addition, the experiment can be completed in one laboratory period with minimal equipment and setup, is inexpensive, and requires no animal sacrifice. There are five objectives to the experiment.",2000,
A machine learning approach for the prediction of pulmonary hypertension,"BACKGROUND
Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for identifying and structuring several informative variables for predictive tasks. Here, we investigated how ML algorithms may assist in echocardiographic pulmonary hypertension (PH) prediction, where current guidelines recommend integrating several echocardiographic parameters.


METHODS
In our database of 90 patients with invasively determined pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) with corresponding echocardiographic estimations of PAP obtained within 24 hours, we trained and applied five ML algorithms (random forest of classification trees, random forest of regression trees, lasso penalized logistic regression, boosted classification trees, support vector machines) using a 10 times 3-fold cross-validation (CV) scheme.


RESULTS
ML algorithms achieved high prediction accuracies: support vector machines (AUC 0.83; 95% CI 0.73-0.93), boosted classification trees (AUC 0.80; 95% CI 0.68-0.92), lasso penalized logistic regression (AUC 0.78; 95% CI 0.67-0.89), random forest of classification trees (AUC 0.85; 95% CI 0.75-0.95), random forest of regression trees (AUC 0.87; 95% CI 0.78-0.96). In contrast to the best of several conventional formulae (by Aduen et al.), this ML algorithm is based on several echocardiographic signs and feature selection, with estimated right atrial pressure (RAP) being of minor importance.


CONCLUSIONS
Using ML, we were able to predict pulmonary hypertension based on a broader set of echocardiographic data with little reliance on estimated RAP compared to an existing formula with non-inferior performance. With the conceptual advantages of a broader and unbiased selection and weighting of data our ML approach is suited for high level assistance in PH prediction.",2019,PLoS ONE

No treatment was decided to face these skin lesions given the very young age of the patient. Psychological support is planned in the long run.",2017,Pediatric Reports
EPSâ€LASSO: test for highâ€dimensional regression under extreme phenotype sampling of continuous traits,"Motivation: Extreme phenotype sampling (EPS) is a broadlyâ€used design to identify candidate genetic factors contributing to the variation of quantitative traits. By enriching the signals in extreme phenotypic samples, EPS can boost the association power compared to random sampling. Most existing statistical methods for EPS examine the genetic factors individually, despite many quantitative traits have multiple genetic factors underlying their variation. It is desirable to model the joint effects of genetic factors, which may increase the power and identify novel quantitative trait loci under EPS. The joint analysis of genetic data in highâ€dimensional situations requires specialized techniques, e.g. the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Although there are extensive research and application related to LASSO, the statistical inference and testing for the sparse model under EPS remain unknown. Results: We propose a novel sparse model (EPSâ€LASSO) with hypothesis test for highâ€dimensional regression under EPS based on a decorrelated score function. The comprehensive simulation shows EPSâ€LASSO outperforms existing methods with stable type I error and FDR control. EPSâ€LASSO can provide a consistent power for both lowâ€ and highâ€dimensional situations compared with the other methods dealing with highâ€dimensional situations. The power of EPSâ€LASSO is close to other lowâ€dimensional methods when the causal effect sizes are small and is superior when the effects are large. Applying EPSâ€LASSO to a transcriptomeâ€wide gene expression study for obesity reveals 10 significant body mass index associated genes. Our results indicate that EPSâ€LASSO is an effective method for EPS data analysis, which can account for correlated predictors.

Association mapping identified novel candidate loci affecting wood formation in Norway spruce,"âž¢ Norway spruce (Picea abies) is an important boreal forest tree species of significant ecological and economic importance. Hence there is a strong imperative to dissect the genetics controlling important wood quality traits in Norway spruce. âž¢ We performed a functional genome-wide association mapping of 17 wood quality traits in Norway spruce using 178101 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated from exome genotyping of 517 mother trees. The wood quality traits were defined using functional modelling of wood properties across annual growth rings. âž¢ Association mapping was performed using a multilocus LASSO penalized regression method and we detected a total of 51 significant SNPs from 39 candidate genes that are involved in wood formation. âž¢ Our study represents the first functional multi-locus genome-wide association mapping (AM) in Norway spruce. The results advance our understanding of the genetics influencing wood traits, identify novel candidate genes for further functional studies and support current Norway spruce breeding efforts.",2018,bioRxiv
Essays on identification and estimation of networks,"This thesis consists of three chapters that explore the estimation and identification of networks from observable outcomes and covariates only. This problem is equivalent to estimating the spatial neighbouring matrix from a spatial econometric model. Under three settings, I show how the networks can be recovered entirely from observable non-network data. 
In the first chapter, networks are treated as a source of unobserved heterogeneity and dealt with data collected from observing many groups in one period of time. The proposed method estimates the probability that pairs of individuals form connections, which may depend on exogenous factors such as common gender. I derive a maximum likelihood estimator for network effects that is not conditional on network observation, accomplished with recourse to a spatial econometric model with unobserved and stochastic networks. I apply the model to estimate network effects in the context of a program evaluation. 
The second chapter assumes the observation of one group over many periods of time and estimates the networks as a collection of pairwise links. We estimate the spatial neighbouring matrix with recourse to the Adaptive Lasso. Non-asymptotic Oracle inequalities, together with the asymptotic sign consistency of the estimators, are presented and proved. 
The third chapter shows how the procedure developed in the preceding paper can be used to classify individuals into groups based on similarity of observed behavior. We propose a Lasso estimator that captures the block structure of the spatial neighboring matrix. The main results show that off-diagonal block elements are estimated as zeros with high probability. We correctly identified US Senateâ€™s blocks based on party affiliation using only voting data. 
Empirical research on social and economic networks has been constrained by the limited availability of data regarding such networks. This collection of papers may therefore provide an useful tool for applied research.",2015,
Bending Analysis of Parabolic Velaroidal Shells,"This paper deals with the linear analysis of parabolic velaroidal shell on rectangular base subjected to a uniform normal pressure. Vlassov's governing differential equations for thin shallow shells with variable curvatures in terms of displacements have been employed for the analysis. The integral equation technique is used for the numerical solution of these differential equations. A computer program has been developed for the analysis of the shell. This program gives deflections and stress resultants at various points in the shell under uniformly distributed loads. The present results are compared with Brebbia's experimental data and with other available numerical results. In all these comparisons, a good agreement is achieved.",1980,Journal of the Structural Division
High Dimensional Mediation Analysis with Applications to Causal Gene Identification,"Mediation analysis has been a popular framework for elucidating the mediating mechanism of the exposure effect on the outcome. Previous literature in causal mediation primarily focused on the classical settings with univariate exposure and univariate mediator, with recent growing interests in high dimensional mediator. In this paper, we study the mediation model with high dimensional exposure and high dimensional mediator, and introduce two procedures for mediator selection, MedFix and MedMix. MedFix is our new application of adaptive lasso with one additional tuning parameter. MedMix is a novel mediation model based on high dimensional linear mixed model, for which we also develop a new variable selection algorithm. Our study is motivated by the causal gene identification problem, where causal genes are defined as the genes that mediate the genetic effect. For this problem, the genetic variants are the high dimensional exposure, the gene expressions the high dimensional mediator, and the phenotype of interest the outcome. We evaluate the proposed methods using a mouse f2 dataset for diabetes study, and extensive real data driven simulations. We show that the mixed model based approach leads to higher accuracy in mediator selection and mediation effect size estimation, and is more reproducible across independent measurements of the response and more robust against model misspecification.

Genome prediction accuracy of common bean via Bayesian models,"EnglishWe aimed to apply genomic information based on SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) markers for the genetic evaluation of the traits â€œstay-greenâ€ (SG), plant architecture (PA), grain aspect (GA) and grain yield (GY) in common bean through Bayesian models. These models were compared in terms of prediction accuracy and ability for heritability estimation for each one of the mentioned traits. A total of 80 cultivars were genotyped for 377 SNP markers, whose effects were estimated by five different Bayesian models: Bayes A (BA), B (BB), C (BC), LASSO (BL) e Ridge regression (BRR). Although, prediction accuracies calculated by means of cross-validation have been similar within each trait, the BB model stood out for the trait SG, whereas the BRR was indicated for the remaining traits. The heritability estimates for the traits SG, PA, GA and GY were 0.61, 0.28, 0.32 and 0.29, respectively. In summary, the Bayesian methods applied here were effective and ease to be implemented. The used SNP markers can help in the early selection of promising genotypes, since incorporating genomic information increase the prediction accuracy of the estimated genetic merit.

Analysis of temporal-length limitations in XeCl lasers,"SummaryExperimental observations of the development of constrictions in rare-gas halide laser discharges are reported.

We provide here Lasso and Dantzig learners of the RR and corresponding learners of affine and other nonlinear functionals. We give an asymptotic variance estimator for DML.

A total of 386 hospitals, of which 98 hospitals (25.4%) had a poor performance in the first zone, 79 hospitals (20.4%) had moderate performance in the second zone, 123 hospitals (32.1%) had a great performance in the third zone, and 86 hospitals (22.1%) were relatively modest performance in the fourth zone. Given that the most of the hospitals have above average performance, it is necessary to perform detailed plans for the optimal use of human and material resources in hospitals.",2017,Annals of Tropical Medicine and Public Health
Efficient Regularization Parameter Selection for Latent Variable Graphical Models via Bi-Level Optimization,"Latent variable graphical models are an extension of Gaussian graphical models that decompose the precision matrix into a sparse and a low-rank component. These models can be learned with theoretical guarantees from data via a semidefinite program. This program features two regularization terms, one for promoting sparsity and one for promoting a low rank. In practice, however, it is not straightforward to learn a good model since the model highly depends on the regularization parameters that control the relative weight of the loss function and the two regularization terms. Selecting good regularization parameters can be modeled as a bi-level optimization problem, where the upper level optimizes some form of generalization error and the lower level provides a description of the solution gamut. The solution gamut is the set of feasible solutions for all possible values of the regularization parameters. In practice, it is often not feasible to describe the solution gamut efficiently. Hence, algorithmic schemes for approximating solution gamuts have been devised. One such scheme is Bensonâ€™s generic vector optimization algorithm that comes with approximation guarantees. So far Bensonâ€™s algorithm has not been used in conjunction with semidefinite programs like the latent variable graphical Lasso. Here, we develop an adaptive variant of Bensonâ€™s algorithm for the semidefinite case and show that it keeps the known approximation and run time guarantees. Furthermore, Bensonâ€™s algorithm turns out to be practically more efficient for the latent variable graphical model than the existing solution gamut approximation scheme on a wide range of data sets.",2019,

Exploiting Covariate Similarity in Sparse Regression via the Pairwise Elastic Net,"A new approach to regression regularization called the Pairwise Elastic Net is proposed. Like the Elastic Net, it simultaneously performs automatic variable selection and continuous shrinkage. In addition, the Pairwise Elastic Net encourages the grouping of strongly correlated predictors based on a pairwise similarity measure. We give examples of how the approach can be used to achieve the objectives of Ridge regression, the Lasso, the Elastic Net, and Group Lasso. Finally, we present a coordinate descent algorithm to solve the Pairwise Elastic Net.",2010,
A Note on the SPICE Method,"In this article, we analyze the SPICE method developed in , and establish its connections with other standard sparse estimation methods such as the Lasso and the LAD-Lasso. This result positions SPICE as a computationally efficient technique for the calculation of Lasso-type estimators. Conversely, this connection is very useful for establishing the asymptotic properties of SPICE under several problem scenarios and for suggesting suitable modifications in cases where the naive version of SPICE would not work.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Proximal gradient method with automatic selection of the parameter by automatic differentiation,"A class of non-smooth convex optimization problems which arise naturally from applications in sparse group Lasso, have attracted significant research efforts for parameters selection. For given parameters of the problem, proximal gradient method (PGM) is effective to solve it with linear convergence rate and the closed form solution can be obtained at each iteration. However, in many practical applications, the selection of the parameters not only affects the quality of solution, but also even determines whether the solution is right or not. In this paper, we study a new method to analyse the impact of the parameters on PGM algorithm to solve the non-smooth convex optimization problem. We present the sensitivity analysis on the output of an optimization algorithm over parameter, and show the advantage of the technique using automatic differentiation. Then, we propose a hybrid algorithm for selecting the optimal parameter based on the method of PGM. The numerical results show that the proposed method is ef...",2018,Optimization Methods and Software
Predicting the Internet â€™ s Evolution with Decision Trees and Lasso Logistic Regression Models,"The Internet self-evolves rapidly and its dynamic structure poses many interesting questions for researchers in network analysis. In this paper I show how we can simplify the entire Internet as a mathematical graph and then extract its structural characteristics; these characteristics in turn help us build statistical models that can predict how the Internet will evolve. The data describing the Internet structure are both clustered and unbalanced. I hence test various models, including lasso logistic regression, gradient-boosted decision trees and random forest decision trees, to see how well they cope with unbalanced and clustered data. The best performing model was created through a gradient-boosted decision tree that balances flexibility in fitting with robustness in prediction. I show that we can achieve good predicting power using fairly simple explanatory variables, but I also discuss how we can extract more sophisticated variables to improve the modelsâ€™ performance.",2014,
"Can Urbanization, Social and Spatial Disparities Help to Understand the Rise of Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Bobo-Dioulasso? A Study in a Secondary City of Burkina Faso, West Africa","Background: Unplanned urbanization plays a key role in chronic disease growth. This population-based cross-sectional study assessed the occurrence of cardiometabolic risk factors in Bobo-Dioulasso and their association with urbanization conditions. Methods: Through spatial sampling, four Bobo-Dioulasso sub-spaces were selected for a population survey to measure the adult health status. YÃ©guÃ©rÃ©, Dogona, Tounouma and Secteur 25 had very different urbanization conditions (position within the city; time of creation and healthcare structure access). The sample size was estimated at 1000 households (250 for each sub-space) in which one adult (35 to 59-year-old) was randomly selected. Finally, 860 adults were surveyed. Anthropometric, socioeconomic and clinical data were collected. Arterial blood pressure was measured and blood samples were collected to assess glycemia. Results: Weight, body mass index and waist circumference (mean values) and serum glycemia (83.4 mg/dL Â± 4.62 mmol/L) were significantly higher in Tounouma, Dogona, and Secteur 25 than in YÃ©guÃ©rÃ©; the poorest and most rural-like sub-space (p = 0.001). Overall, 43.2%, 40.5%, 5.3% and 60.9% of participants had overweight, hypertension, hyperglycemia and one or more cardiometabolic risk markers, respectively. Conclusions: Bobo-Dioulasso is unprepared to face this public health issue and urgent responses are needed to reduce the health risks associated with unplanned urbanization.",2017,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
Grating-based 40-Gbit/s optical code-division multiplexing system incorporating a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror,"Abstract. A seven-chip, 280-Gchip/s OCDM system incorporating qua-ternary phase coding and decoding is experimentally demonstrated. Theencoder and decoder, consisting of superstructured ï¬ber Bragg gratings,are fabricated using the equivalent-phase-shift method; only ordinaryphase masks and submicrometer precision in control are required. Inter-channel interference noise is also considered and evaluated; 40-Gbit/s2-channel multiplexing is demonstrated. In addition, a nonlinear ampli-fying loop mirror NALM within the receiver is introduced to improve thesystem performance under two-channel operation.

Response of pulmonary vein potentials to premature stimulation.,"INTRODUCTION
Pulmonary vein potentials reflect depolarization of muscle fascicles within the myocardial sleeves that surround the pulmonary veins. The response of pulmonary vein potentials to premature stimulation has not been described.


METHODS AND RESULTS
In 31 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation referred for segmental isolation of the pulmonary veins, programmed stimulation with a single atrial extrastimulus was performed from the coronary sinus. Bipolar and unipolar electrograms were recorded with a decapolar Lasso catheter positioned sequentially within the left superior, left inferior, and right superior pulmonary veins, near the ostium. Premature stimulation often resulted in greater separation of the atrial and pulmonary vein potentials recorded within the pulmonary veins, fractionation of the pulmonary vein potentials, a change in the circumferential activation sequence of the pulmonary vein potentials, and dropout of pulmonary vein potentials.


CONCLUSION
In response to premature stimulation, the muscle fascicles within the myocardial sleeves that surround the pulmonary veins display a greater degree of decremental conduction than do the myocardial fibers in the adjacent left atrium, and they display heterogeneity in conduction properties and refractoriness. Discrimination of pulmonary vein potentials from atrial electrograms is facilitated by premature stimulation.",2002,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology
Triangular-Cell Elastic Lattice,"Analytical solutions for crack propagation in a plane triangular-cell lattice were derived for the uniform straight line crack growth, that is, these solutions correspond to cutting of the crack-path bonds with a given speed. The first work in this topic was published by Kulakhmetova et al [131] where the total dissipation was found for the case of the sub-Rayleigh macrolevelassociated solution. Recently the complete set of the macrolevel-associated and microlevel solutions for all crack speed regimes, sub-Rayleigh, superRayleigh, intersonic and supersonic, was examined by Slepyan [223] . The latter paper is followed below. Stability of the crack propagation in the triangular lattice was examined by Marder and Xiangming Liu [145], Marder and Gross [144] and Fineberg and Marder [67].",2002,

On the LASSO and Dantzig selector equivalence,"Recovery of sparse signals from noisy observations is a problem that arises in many information processing contexts. LASSO and the Dantzig selector (DS) are two well-known schemes used to recover high-dimensional sparse signals from linear observations. This paper presents some results on the equivalence between LASSO and DS. We discuss a set of conditions under which the solutions of LASSO and DS are same. With these conditions in place, we formulate a shrinkage procedure for which LASSO and DS follow the same solution path. Furthermore, we show that under these shrinkage conditions the solution to LASSO and DS can be attained in at most S homotopy steps, where S is the number of nonzero elements in the final solution. Thus the computational cost for finding complete homotopy path for an M Ã— N system is merely O(SMN).",2010,2010 44th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)

Numerical modeling of flow and solute transport phenomena in subsurface and coupled surface-subsurface hydrology,"The overall aim of the work described in this thesis is to bring a number of contributions to hydrology and hydrological modeling in the framework of a specific physically-based numerical model for integrated surface subsurface and flow-transport processes, the CATchment-HYdrology Flow-Transport (CATHY_FT) model. These contributions revolve around three main themes: the enhancement of the numerical performance of hydrological models for flow and transport phenomena, the improvement of our current understanding of complex boundary conditions in order to reduce the errors associated with their modeling, and the testing and benchmarking of distributed physically-based models for groundwater flow and transport processes. The work to achieve the general objective is elaborated into four stages. First, the Larson-Niklasson post-processing algorithm is implemented in CATHY_FT to reconstruct mass-conservative velocities from a linear, or P1, Galerkin solution of Richards' equation. This is done to improve the accuracy and mass balance properties of the companion advective transport model (finite volume-based), which rely on accurate velocity fields as input. Through a comparison between the results from the reconstructed velocities and the P1 Galerkin velocities, it is shown that a locally mass-conservative velocity field is necessary to obtain accurate transport results. Second, a detailed and novel analysis of the behavior of seepage face boundaries is performed with the flow model of CATHY_FT. The numerical simulations examine the model's performance under complex conditions such as heterogeneity and coupled surface/subsurface flow. It is shown that the overall numerical solution can be greatly affected by the way seepage face boundaries are handled in hydrological models and that careful considerations are required when using simple approximations, in the presence of heterogeneous slopes, and for seepage faces forming on a portion of the land surface. Third, CATHY_FT is implemented and run at the Landscape Evolution Observatory of the Biosphere 2 facility, Arizona. A detailed modeling analysis is performed of the experimental data collected during an isotope tracer experiment and from an intensively-measured hillslope, including quantity and quality of groundwater discharge and point-scale flow and transport data. This flow and tracer data is used to incrementally explore complex phenomena and associated hypotheses (e.g., heterogeneity, fractionation, and dispersion), progressing from flow to transport and from integrated to point-scale response analysis. This incremental approach highlights the challenges in testing and validating the new generation of integrated hydrological models when considering many types and levels of observation data. Finally, a concluding analysis is performed that relates to all three themes of the thesis, describing some of the features of the CATHY_FT model, discussing key issues associated to its further development, and testing its physical and numerical behavior for both real and synthetic scenarios. This final stage of the thesis addresses the myriad challenges faced in accurately and efficiently resolving the difficult behavior of the advection-dispersion equation for subsurface solute transport, in properly handling the complex boundary conditions for solute interactions across the land surface, and generally in capturing process interactions and feedbacks between flow and transport phenomena in surface and subsurface environments.",2016,
Electronic communication and the future of international public health surveillance.,"Recent developments in electronic communication have enhanced national public health surveillance systems and facilitated progress in establishing surveillance that crosses national boundaries. The international foodborne outbreak of Shigella sonnei described by Frost and colleagues was first reported through Salmnet (1), a laboratorybased surveillance system designed to include an on-line network database. Salmnet was established in 1994 to improve the prevention and control of human salmonellosis and other foodborne infections in the countries of the European Union and the European Cooperation in Science and Technology. Epidemiologists who have national surveillance responsibilities and heads of reference laboratories in 13 countries currently collaborate in the Salmnet project under the joint leadership of the Directors of the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens and the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) at the Public Health Laboratory Service campus at Colindale, London. During the course of two workshops, the collaborators agreed to a) develop and apply standardized phage typing for the most common salmonella serotypes within Europe, b) introduce an international quality assurance scheme for laboratory performance of Salmonella phage typing, c) establish a core set of data on each laboratory-confirmed and typed human salmonella isolate for rapid transfer into a shared nonaggregated dataset, and d) develop statistical analysis programs to facilitate the early recognition of international outbreaks. The collaborators also agreed to rapidly report any clusters detected and to exchange information concerning other infections, including those caused by Shigella, Listeria, and vero-cytotoxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli. Currently six countries share data through the Internet, while the other seven countries rely on faxing material or sending diskettes through the mail. All collaborating countries plan to join the on-line network by the end of 1995. The opportunities offered by electronic communication have encouraged a remarkable degree of international cooperation in surveillance, as is evident in the far reaching objectives agreed upon for Salmnet. The Salmnet collaboration was already in place when the S. sonnei outbreak in Sweden was reported to Colindale. CDSC responded by sending an electronic message throughout England and Wales by Epinet, an electronic system for the rapid transfer of vital public health information developed by the CDSC Welsh Unit in Cardiff (2). The message was sent to consultants in communicable disease control in each district health authority, to the 53 public health laboratories, and to other agencies in England and Wales involved in infectious disease control. Further information from Norway, Scotland, and Sweden reinforced and stimulated the ongoing investigation in England and Wales. Since its inception, Salmnet has also contributed information with potential international implications concerning several Salmonella serotypes ( 3,4). The signing of the Treaty of Maastricht (1992) was an important milestone for international cooperation in public health surveillance. The treaty established a basis for European Community action in the field of public health and enjoined cooperation between member states, third countries, and international public health organizations to protect human health. Sufficient evidence has accrued on the added value of international surveillance of infectious diseases, and it is generally accepted that the potential for major public health hazards is amplified as a consequence of the increasing volume of international travel and the global extension of food distribution networks (5). Surveillance systems such as Salmnet and the European Surveillance of TravelAssociated Legionnairesâ€™ Disease (6) will pave the way for international surveillance by providing a communications network that will facilitate the rapid collection and analysis of data using standard case definitions, transmission of information for the prevention of communicable diseases, and the promotion of effective public health practice. Parallel electronic surveillance systems in the United States offer equal opportunity for international collaboration. For example, since 1985, data on notifiable diseases have been transmitted electronically each week to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from state health departments by the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS) (7). NETSS was developed by CDC and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists for electronically collecting, transmitting, analyzing, and publishing weekly reports of notifiable diseases and injuries from 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (8). The operation of NETSS is based on agreements on reporting conditions, standard case definitions, and protocols for formatting and transmitting data, rather than prescribed software or systems. A second CDC electronic reporting system, the Public Health Laboratory Information System (PHLIS), is used by public health department laboratories in all states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and Guam to report laboratory isolatebased surveillance data to CDC. The PC-based system was developed jointly by the National Center for Commentary",1995,Emerging Infectious Diseases
Machine Learning for Pavement Friction Prediction Using Scikit-Learn,"During the last decades, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been taking place in several technical and scientific areas. Despite its success, AI applications to solve real-life problems in pavement engineering are far from reaching its potential. In this paper, a Python machine learning library, scikit-learn, is used to predict asphalt pavement friction. Using data from the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database, 113 different sections of asphalt concrete pavement, spread all over the United States, were selected. Two machine learning models were built from these data to predict friction, one based on linear regression and the other on regularized regression with lasso. Both models showed to be feasible and perform similarly. According to the results, initial friction plays an essential role in the way friction evolves over time. The results of this study also showed that scikit-learn can be a versatile tool to solve pavement engineering problems. By applying machine learning methods to predict asphalt pavements friction, this paper emphasizes how theory and practice can be effectively coupled to solve real-life problems in contemporary transportation.",2017,
Wisdom of artificial crowds feature selection in untargeted metabolomics: An application to the development of a blood-based diagnostic test for thrombotic myocardial infarction,"Introduction Heart disease remains a leading cause of global mortality. While acute myocardial infarction (colloquially: heart attack), has multiple proximate causes, proximate etiology cannot be determined by a blood-based diagnostic test. We enrolled a suitable patient cohort and conducted an untargeted quantification of plasma metabolites by mass spectrometry for developing a test that can differentiate between thrombotic MI, non-thrombotic MI, and stable disease. A significant challenge in developing such a diagnostic test is solving the NP-hard problem of feature selection for constructing an optimal statistical classifier. Objective We employed a Wisdom of Artificial Crowds (WoAC) strategy for solving the feature selection problem and evaluated the accuracy and parsimony of downstream classifiers in comparison with embedded feature selection via the Lasso and Elastic Net. Materials and Methods Artificial Crowd Wisdom was generated via aggregation of the best solutions from independent and diverse genetic algorithm populations that were initialized with bootstrapping and a random subspaces constraint. Results / Conclusions WoAC feature selection performed favorably compared to Lasso and Elastic Net solutions. The classifier constructed following WoAC feature selection had a cross-validation estimated misclassification rate of 2.6% as compared to 26.3% via the Lasso and 18.5% via an Elastic Net. The classifier warrants further evaluation as a diagnostic test in an independent cohort.",2017,bioRxiv
Integrating biomarkers across omic platforms: an approach to improve stratification of patients with indolent and aggressive prostate cancer,"Classifying indolent prostate cancer represents a significant clinical challenge. We investigated whether integrating data from different omic platforms could identify a biomarker panel with improved performance compared to individual platforms alone. DNA methylation, transcripts, protein and glycosylation biomarkers were assessed in a single cohort of patients treated by radical prostatectomy. Novel multiblock statistical data integration approaches were used to deal with missing data and modelled via stepwise multinomial logistic regression, or LASSO. After applying leave-one-out cross-validation to each model, the probabilistic predictions of disease type for each individual panel were aggregated to improve prediction accuracy using all available information for a given patient. Through assessment of three performance parameters of area under the curve (AUC) values, calibration and decision curve analysis, the study identified an integrated biomarker panel which predicts disease type with a high level of accuracy, with Multi AUC value of 0.91 (0.89, 0.94) and Ordinal C-Index (ORC) value of 0.94 (0.91, 0.96), which was significantly improved compared to the values for the clinical panel alone of 0.67 (0.62, 0.72) Multi AUC and 0.72 (0.67, 0.78) ORC. Biomarker integration across different omic platforms significantly improves prediction accuracy. We provide a novel multiplatform approach for the analysis, determination and performance assessment of novel panels which can be applied to other diseases. With further refinement and validation, this panel could form a tool to help inform appropriate treatment strategies impacting on patient outcome in early stage prostate cancer.",2018,Molecular Oncology
Protein Structure Prediction by Protein Alignments,"Proteins are the basic building blocks of life. They usually perform functions by folding to a particular structure. Understanding the folding process could help the researchers to understand the functions of proteins and could also help to develop supplemental proteins for people with deficiencies and gain more insight into diseases associated with troublesome folding proteins. Experimental methods are both expensive and time consuming. In this thesis I introduce a new machine learning based method to predict the protein structure. The new method improves the performance from two directions: creating accurate protein alignments and predicting accurate protein contacts. First, I present an alignment framework MRFalign which goes beyond state-of-the-art methods and uses Markov Random Fields to model a protein family and align two proteins by aligning two MRFs together. Compared to other methods, that can only model local-range residue correlation, MRFs can model long-range residue interactions and thus, encodes global information in a protein. Secondly, I present a Group Graphical Lasso method for contact prediction that integrates joint multi-family Evolutionary Coupling analysis and supervised learning to improve accuracy on proteins without many sequence homologs. Different from single-family EC analysis that uses residue co-evolution information in only the target protein family, our joint EC analysis uses residue co-evolution in both the target family and its related families, which may have divergent sequences but similar folds. Our method can also integrate supervised learning methods to further improve accuracy. We evaluate the performance of both methods including each of its components on large public benchmarks. Experiments show that our methods can achieve better accuracy than existing state-of-the-art methods under all the measurements on most of the protein classes.",2015,ArXiv
Modeling of various biological networks via LCMARS,"Abstract In system biology, the interactions between components such as genes, proteins, can be represented by a network. To understand the molecular mechanism of complex biological systems, construction of their networks plays a crucial role. However, estimation of these biological networks is a challenging problem because of their high dimensional and sparse structures. Several statistical methods are proposed to overcome this issue. The Conic Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (CMARS) is one of the recent nonparametric methods developed for high dimensional and correlated data. This model is suggested to improve the performance of the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) approach which is a complex model under the generalized additive models. From previous studies, it has been shown that MARS can be a promising model for the description of steady-state activations of biological networks if it is modified as a lasso-type regression via the main effects. In this study, we convert the full description of CMARS as a loop-based approach, so-called LCMARS, by including both main and second-order interaction effects since this description has performed better in benchmark real datasets. Here, we generate various scenarios based on distinct distributions and dimensions to compare the performance of LCMARS with MARS and Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) in terms of accuracy measures via Monte Carlo runs. Additionally, different real biological datasets are used to observe the performance of underlying methods.",2018,J. Comput. Sci.
Prokaryotic microbiota in the digestive cavity of the jellyfish Cotylorhiza tuberculata.,"The microbiota associated to the gastric cavity of four exemplars of the jellyfish Cotylorhiza tuberculata has been studied by means of cultured-dependent and -independent methods. The pyrosequencing approach rendered a very reduced diversity of Bacteria with four major groups shared by the four exemplars that made up to 95% of the total diversity. The culturing approach recovered low abundant organisms and some of them also detected by the pyrosequencing approach. The major key organisms were related to the genera Spiroplasma, Thalassospira, Tenacibaculum (from the pyrosequencing data), and Vibrio (from the cultivable fraction). Altogether the results indicate that C. tuberculata harbors an associated microbiota of very reduced diversity. On the other hand, some of the major key players may be potential pathogens and the host may serve as dispersal mechanism.",2015,Systematic and applied microbiology
The Prognostic Value of m6A RNA Methylation Regulators in Colon Adenocarcinoma,"BACKGROUND The RNA-seq FPKM data of 331 colorectal adenocarcinoma samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas database with matching clinical data were analyzed in order to reveal the prognostic value of m6A RNA methylation regulators in colon adenocarcinoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression of 13 m6A RNA methylated regulators in samples were analyzed. The samples were classified into Cluster I and II by consistent clustering. The gene distribution was analyzed by principal component analysis. Further functional analysis of selected m6A RNA genes was performed and potential risk characteristics was developed using Lasso Cox regression algorithm. Using minimum criteria, the risk coefficients of YTHDF1 and HNRNPC were detected for Cluster II. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk subgroups based on the risk characteristics. The clinical data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS Expression of the detected m6A RNA methylated regulators except YTHDC2 in tumors were significantly different from their adjacent mucosa. Among them, only ALKBH5 and METTL4 were downregulated in tumors. The gene distribution between the 2 subgroups were different. The expression of m6A RNA methylation regulators including YTHDF1, HNRNPC, YTHDC2, YTHDC1, ZC3H13, and RBM15 were different between the 2 groups (P<0.05). The prognostic characteristics between the high-risk and low-risk groups were significant different (P<0.05), which had a good predictive significance of prognosis area under the curve (AUC)=0.62). Risk scores were less than 0.05, suggesting risk score was an independent prognostic factor for colon adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS m6A RNA methylation regulators YTHDF1 and HNRNPC can be used as prognostic factors of colon cancer, which has potential value for colon cancer treatment.",2019,Medical Science Monitor : International Medical Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research
Rethinking health care commercialization: evidence from Malaysia,"BackgroundAgainst the backdrop of systemic inefficiency in the public health care system and the theoretical claims that markets result in performance and efficiency improvement, developing countriesâ€™ governments have been rapidly commercializing health care delivery. This paper seeks to determine whether commercialization through an expansion in private hospitals has led to performance improvements in public hospitals.MethodsInpatient utilization records of all public hospitals in Peninsular Malaysia over the period 2006â€“2010 were used in this study. These records were obtained from the Ministry of Health. The study relied on utilization ratios, bed occupancy rates (BOR), bed turnover rates (BTR) and average length of stay (ALOS). The data were analyzed using SPSS 22 Statistical Software and the Pabon Lasso technique.ResultsOver 60Â % of public hospitals in Malaysia are inefficient and perform sub-optimally. Average BOR among the public hospitals was 56Â % in 2006 and 61Â % in 2010. There was excessive BTR of 65 and 73 times within the period. Overall, the ALOS was low, falling from 3.4Â days in 2006 to 3.1Â days in 2010.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that commercialization has not led to performance improvements in the public health care sector in Malaysia. The evidence suggests that efforts to improve performance will require a focus directly on public hospitals.",2015,Globalization and Health
L'histoire et l'oeuvre de L'O.C.C.G.E. en afrique occidentale francophone,"Resume From the early days of French colonization in West Africa, it became obvious that mass diseases were attacking whole populations in remote rural areas. Ordinary health services were not capable of coping with these, and under Colonel Jamot in Cameroun an entirely new system of mobile survey and treatment, at first of sleeping sickness, was devised. This system was later put into action in West Africa also. From 1944 it was made polyvalent, the S.G.H.M.P., with headquarters (the Centre Muraz) and a training school of medical auxiliaries (Ecole Jamot) at Bobo-Dioulasso. 3 other research institutes were created; the Institut Marchoux (leprosy) and the Institut d'Ophtalmologie Tropicale at Bamako, and the Office de Recherche sur l'Alimentation et la Nutrition en Afrique at Dakar. When the West African colonies became independent, each of these institutions was nationalized according to its geographical locality, and the general epidemiological work formerly directed from Bobo-Dioulasso was carved up between the various states. However, the loss of efficiency due to lack of co-ordination was soon recognized by the states themselves, and in 1960, they decided to re-form an organization with responsibility for research into, and control of, mass diseases throughout the whole area. This organization was named the Organization de Coordination et Cooperation pour la lutte contre les Grandes Endemies (O.C.C.G.E.). It has an administrative council consisting of the ministers of health, with one of them as president. The Secretary-General has his headquarters at the Centre Muraz, where there are also sections devoted to most of the major endemic diseases. The other institutes, and the sections for field control work, come under its administration. Uniformity of purpose and methods is ensured by frequent conferences held at one or other capital. Moreover, these conferences are attended more and more by observers from non-member states. States other than the 7 original members (France herself making an eighth) are invited to join; 2 have already done so. The general budget of the O.C.C.G.E. is voted by the administrative council, but considerable additional funds are supplied from French sources for specific campaigns, for example against onchocerciasis. Financial aid is received also from WHO, UNICEF, AID and other services. Actually, the French government not only bears half the financial cost of running the 4 institutions of the O.C.C.G.E., but also provides gratis all their technical staff, and the staff in the headquarters and field sections of the member states. These amount to 101 highly qualified men. The Ecole Jamot's student capacity has been increased from 42 to 76, and it is hoped to reach 100 in a few years. Results of O.C.C.G.E. work include the following: Trypanosomiasis incidence is now 0.034% and it is hoped to bring it down even lower. Improved diagnosis, pentamidine prophylaxis and tsetse control by insecticides, all contribute to the improvement. Some 500,000 leprosy patients have been diagnosed, and already systematic treatment has arrested the disease in about half of these. A pilot project on malaria control failed to arrest the transmission cycle, but some very promising results were obtained by chemoprophylaxis. Research into the control of Simulium damnosum and therapeutic trials with a single dose of Mel W for onchocerciasis, are giving promising results. Yaws and endemic syphilis have at least been greatly reduced. Cerebrospinal meningitis is the subject of intense epidemiological and bacteriological study. Vaccination against yellow fever and smallpox has been carried out for many years; 800,000 children have been vaccinated against measles, and another million are at present being vaccinated. Tributes to the work of the old services, which the O.C.C.G.E. has replaced, have been paid by many distinguished Frenchmen and foreigners, including Dr. E. J.

Africa in Motion (AiM) Film Festival 2011: Children and Youth in Africa,"Africa in Motion (AiM) is an annual African film festival taking place in Edinburgh, primarily at Filmhouse Cinema, Edinburghâ€™s premiere independent and arthouse cinema. The sixth edition of Africa in Motion, which took place from 2â€“6 November 2011, took as its main theme â€˜Children and Youth in Africaâ€™. The festival endeavoured to offer a positive and constructive outlook onto the future of the continent, its young nations, and the challenges they face, with a focus on cinematic representations for, by, and about children and young people both in the rural areas and the urban centres of Africa. The programme of film screenings consisted of 30 films from 16 African countries, including feature fiction films, documentaries and shorts, animation, and experimental films. Twenty films had their UK premiere at the festival. All film screenings and complementary events were designed around the overall theme of â€˜Children and Youth in Africaâ€™. The festival opened with Babâ€™Aziz: The Prince Who Contemplated His Soul (Tunisia/Iran, 2005), the last film in the Desert Trilogy by Tunisian director Nacer Khemir. The film is set in the expansive sandscapes of Tunisia and Iran and presents a multi-layered impression of Sufism, through an oral, fairytale structure with many interwoven narratives. The story centres around Babâ€™Aziz, a blind dervish who is travelling with his young granddaughter, Ishtar, to a great reunion of dervishes that takes place every 30 years. Several other feature fiction films also incorporated themes of childhood, parentâ€“child relationships and youth: Notre Ã©trangÃ¨re (The Place in Between, Sarah Bouyain, France/Burkina Faso, 2010) tells the story of a young mixed-race woman, Amy, who leaves Paris to go to Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso to find her mother, from whom she was separated at the age of eight. Also from Burkina Faso, famous director Idrissa Ouedraogoâ€™s La colÃ¨re des dieux (Anger of the Gods, Burkina Faso, 2003) is set in pre-colonial Africa and deals with the struggle between two brothers who vie for power when their father dies after ruling for 20 years. It is an epic tale imbued with ancient cultural beliefs and principles reminiscent of a Greek tragedy. Ali Zaoua, prince de la rue (Ali Zaoua: Prince of the Streets, Morocco, 2000) is Moroccan director Nabil Ayouchâ€™s multi award-winning magic realist portrait of the lives of street children living in Casablanca, depicting their desperation, fears, hopes, and dreams. The festival hosted the UK premiere of another Moroccan film, Pegase (Pegasus, Mohamed Mouftakir, 2011), a surreal coming-ofage drama told through dreamscapes and flashbacks about a young girl growing up in an oppressive patriarchal Islamic society. Pegase won the Golden Stallion at the FESPACO film festival in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in 2011, and AiM hosted its UK premiere. The festival closed",2012,Journal of African Cultural Studies
Anti-predatory chemical defenses of ascidians: secondary metabolites or inorganic acids?,"Both secondary metabolites and inorganic acids have been hypothesized to protect adult ascidians from predation, raising the possibility of alternative defensive strategies in these sessile, soft-bodied, benthic invertebrates. The objective of this investigation was to determine if ascidian species from the Western Atlantic have these chemical defenses against fish predators, and if so, to determine their location within the body of the ascidian. The palatability of crude organic extracts of whole ascidians, as well as the dissected tunics, viscera, and gonads (when possible) were determined at natural volumetric concentrations using laboratory feeding assays with the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum. Acidified food pellets were also assayed to determine the effect of lowered pH on predation. Sixteen of the 17 species tested had deterrent organic extracts from some region of the body (Aplidium constellatum, Aplidium stellatum, Ascidia interrupta, Ascidia nigra, Botrylloides sp., Clavellina picta, Didemnum candidum, Didemnum vanderhosti, Diplosoma listerianum, Ecteinascidia turbinata, Eudistoma capsulatum, Eudistoma hepaticum, Rhopalaea abdominalis, Styela plicata, Symplegma rubra, and Trididemnum solidum). The location of the deterrent secondary metabolites was isolated in the gonad in all three solitary species, raising the possibility that these defenses are passed on to eggs or larvae. Nine ascidian species sequestered acid in their tunics (A. interrupta, A. nigra, A. stellatum, D. candidum, D. vanderhosti, E. capsulatum, E. hepaticum, R. abdominalis, and T. solidum) at levels that were effective in deterring fish predation (pHâ‰¤3.0). Only one species (Botrylloides nigrum) had neither chemical defense. Results of this study indicate that there is not a clear trade-off between the presence of secondary metabolites and inorganic acid defenses in ascidians, suggesting that these defenses are redundant, or that alternative chemical defenses may have evolved for different predators or for different stages in the life history of the ascidians producing them.",2002,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology
Elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of vitamin B groups and potential secondary metabolite gene clusters via genome analysis of a marine bacterium Pseudoruegeria sp. M32A2M.,"The symbiotic nature of the relationship between algae and marine bacteria is well-studied among the complex microbial interactions. The mutual profit between algae and bacteria occurs via nutrient and vitamin exchange. It is necessary to analyze the genome sequence of a bacterium to predict its symbiotic relationships. In this study, the genome of a marine bacterium, Pseudoruegeria sp. M32A2M, isolated from the south-eastern isles (GeoJe-Do) of South Korea, was sequenced and analyzed. A draft genome (91 scaffolds) of 5.5 Mb with a DNA G+C content of 62.4% was obtained. In total, 5,101 features were identified from gene annotation, and 4,927 genes were assigned to functional proteins. We also identified transcription core proteins, RNA polymerase subunits, and sigma factors. In addition, full flagella-related gene clusters involving the flagellar body, motor, regulator, and other accessory compartments were detected even though the genus Pseudoruegeria is known to comprise non-motile bacteria. Examination of annotated KEGG pathways revealed that Pseudoruegeria sp. M32A2M has the metabolic pathways for all seven vitamin Bs, including thiamin (vitamin B1), biotin (vitamin B7), and cobalamin (vitamin B12), which are necessary for symbiosis with vitamin B auxotroph algae. We also identified gene clusters for seven secondary metabolites including ectoine, homoserine lactone, beta-lactone, terpene, lasso peptide, bacteriocin, and non-ribosomal proteins.",2020,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology
GWAS-based machine learning approach to predict duloxetine response in major depressive disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and is commonly treated with antidepressant drugs. However, large variability is observed in terms of response to antidepressants. Machine learning (ML) models may be useful to predict treatment outcomes. A sample of 186 MDD patients received treatment with duloxetine for up to 8 weeks were categorized as ""responders"" based on a MADRS change >50% from baseline; or ""remitters"" based on a MADRS score â‰¤10â€¯at end point. The initial dataset (Nâ€¯=â€¯186) was randomly divided into training and test sets in a nested 5-fold cross-validation, where 80% was used as a training set and 20% made up five independent test sets. We performed genome-wide logistic regression to identify potentially significant variants related to duloxetine response/remission and extracted the most promising predictors using LASSO regression. Subsequently, classification-regression trees (CRT) and support vector machines (SVM) were applied to construct models, using ten-fold cross-validation. With regards to response, none of the pairs performed significantly better than chance (accuracy pâ€¯>â€¯.1). For remission, SVM achieved moderate performance with an accuracyâ€¯=â€¯0.52, a sensitivityâ€¯=â€¯0.58, and a specificityâ€¯=â€¯0.46, and 0.51 for all coefficients for CRT. The best performing SVM fold was characterized by an accuracyâ€¯=â€¯0.66 (pâ€¯=â€¯.071), sensitivityâ€¯=â€¯0.70 and a sensitivityâ€¯=â€¯0.61. In this study, the potential of using GWAS data to predict duloxetine outcomes was examined using ML models. The models were characterized by a promising sensitivity, but specificity remained moderate at best. The inclusion of additional non-genetic variables to create integrated models may improve prediction.",2018,Journal of psychiatric research
Projection-based Inference for High-dimensional Linear Models,"We develop a new method to estimate the projection direction in the debiased Lasso estimator. The basic idea is to decompose the overall bias into two terms corresponding to strong and weak signals respectively. We propose to estimate the projection direction by balancing the squared biases associated with the strong and weak signals as well as the variance of the projection-based estimator. Standard quadratic programming solver can efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem. In theory, we show that the unknown set of strong signals can be consistently estimated and the projection-based estimator enjoys the asymptotic normality under suitable assumptions. A slight modification of our procedure leads to an estimator with a potentially smaller order of bias comparing to the original debiased Lasso. We further generalize our method to conduct inference for a sparse linear combination of the regression coefficients. Numerical studies demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach concerning coverage accuracy over some existing alternatives.",2019,

We qualitatively unify several results related to the Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss lemma, subspace embeddings, and Fourier-based restricted isometries.

Incorporating diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI into a radiomics model improves diagnostic performance for pseudoprogression in glioblastoma patients,"BACKGROUND
Pseudoprogression is a diagnostic challenge in early posttreatment glioblastoma. We therefore developed and validated a radiomics model using multiparametric MRI to differentiate pseudoprogression from early tumor progression in patients with glioblastoma.


METHODS
The model was developed from the enlarging contrast-enhancing portions of 61 glioblastomas within 3 months after standard treatment with 6472 radiomic features being obtained from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps. Imaging features were selected using a LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) logistic regression model with 10-fold cross-validation. Diagnostic performance for pseudoprogression was compared with that for single parameters (mean and minimum ADC and mean and maximum CBV) and single imaging radiomics models using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). The model was validated with an external cohort (n = 34) imaged on a different scanner and internal prospective registry data (n = 23).


RESULTS
Twelve significant radiomic features (3 from conventional, 2 from diffusion, and 7 from perfusion MRI) were selected for model construction. The multiparametric radiomics model (AUC, 0.90) showed significantly better performance than any single ADC or CBV parameter (AUC, 0.57-0.79, P < 0.05), and better than a single radiomics model using conventional MRI (AUC, 0.76, P = 0.012), ADC (AUC, 0.78, P = 0.014), or CBV (AUC, 0.80, P = 0.43). The multiparametric radiomics showed higher performance in the external validation (AUC, 0.85) and internal validation (AUC, 0.96) than any single approach, thus demonstrating robustness.


CONCLUSIONS
Incorporating diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI into a radiomics model improved diagnostic performance for identifying pseudoprogression and showed robustness in a multicenter setting.",2019,Neuro-Oncology
"Dynamics, biomass and total rhizome length of the seagrass Thalassodendron ciliatum at Inhaca Island, Mozambique","Dynamic and structural aspects of Thalassodendron ciliatum were studied in the intertidal zones around Inhaca Island during the rainy seasons 1991 to 1993. Measurements comprised leaf growth rate, leaf detachment rate, biomass, above-ground to below-ground biomass ratios and total rhizome length. On average, three leaves were, at the same time, formed and detached from a shoot during 15 day periods and five leaves from a shoot during 30 day periods. Mean leaf growth rate varied from 101.2 to 159.5 mm, 313.2 to 366.9 mm and 540 to 583.0 mm for 15, 30 and 45 days of measurements respectively. Differences between locations (Banco Sidzanye, Barreira Vermelha and Portinho-EBM/BV) were not statistically significant for the 30 and the 45 day period, but significant for the 15-day period. The average leaf growth rate per day was between 14.1 to 18.3 mm day-1 shoot-1, and the average time for leaf turnover (6 to 9 leaves) on one shoot was four successive spring tides (around 45 days). The average above-ground to below-ground biomass ratio was 1: 1.5 (61% in below-ground biomass) and leaf biomass varied between 45.1 and 211.7 g DW m-2. Total rhizome length varied between 960.0 to 6641.6 cm m-2. A positive correlation was observed between this variable with rhizomes and roots and between rhizomes and roots.",2004,Plant Ecology
Penalized Regression for Genome-Wide Association Screening of Sequence Data,"Whole exome and whole genome sequencing are likely to be potent tools in the study of common diseases and complex traits. Despite this promise, some very difficult issues in data management and statistical analysis must be squarely faced. The number of rare variants identified by sequencing is apt to be much larger than the number of common variants encountered in current association studies. The low frequencies of rare variants alone will make association testing difficult. This article extends the penalized regression framework for model selection in genome-wide association data to sequencing data with both common and rare variants. Previous research has shown that lasso penalties discourage irrelevant predictors from entering a model. The Euclidean penalties dealt with here group variants by gene or pathway. Pertinent biological information can be incorporated by calibrating penalties by weights. The current paper examines some of the tradeoffs in using pure lasso penalties, pure group penalties, and mixtures of the two types of penalty. All of the computational and statistical advantages of lasso penalized estimation are retained in this richer setting. The overall strategy is implemented in the free statistical genetics analysis software MENDEL and illustrated on both simulated and real data.",2011,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

Arab-Byzantine seafaring in the Balkans and Eastern Mediterranean: the portrait of Leo of Tripoli and Damian of Tyre through primary sources,"This paper aims at a re-examination of primary source material in order to unveil a clearer and more comprehensive framework concerning the Arab-Byzantine seafaring and warfare in the Medieval Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean especially in Thessaloniki the largest Balkan city of the Byzantine Empire. Leo of Tripoli and Damian of Tyre, two well-educated and experts in naval tactics converted from Christianity to Islam and initiated massive campaigns â€“ and not piratical assaults â€“ in the Balkans due to the huge antagonism for thalassocracy in the Mediterranean Sea. In this study I argue that the Arabs as well as the Byzantines were acting with fairly lawful practices during their campaigns and the Muslim fleet has been on an equal footing with the Byzantine fleet only after the 3rdâ€“4th AH (9thâ€“10th AD) centuries. It is thus impossible to construe historical events related to the Arab-Byzantine seafaring without researching and analyzing Arabic sources.",2019,
Development and validation of a radiomics signature on differentially expressed features of 18F-FDG PET to predict treatment response of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in thoracic esophagus squamous cell carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
To investigate potential image markers for early prediction of treatment response on thoracic esophagus squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
159 thoracic ESCC patients enrolled from two institutions were divided into training and validation sets. A total of 944 radiomics features were extracted from pretreatment 18F-FDG PET images. We first performed the inter-observer reproducibility test in 10 pairs of patients (responders vs. nonresponders), and the limma package was used to identify differentially expressed features (DEFs). Then the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model with 10-fold cross-validation was used to construct a treatment response related radiomics signature. Finally, the performance was assessed in both sets with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Kaplan-Meier analysis.


RESULTS
After the inter-observer test, 691 features were considered reproducible and been retained (ICCÂ >Â 0.9). 61 DEFs were selected from limma and entered into the LASSO logistic regression model. The radiomics signature was significantly associated with treatment response in the training (pÂ <Â 0.001) and validation set (pÂ =Â 0.026), which achieved area under curve (AUC) values of 0.844 and 0.835, respectively. Delong test results of two ROCs showed no significant difference (pÂ =Â 0.918). The cut-off value of the radiomics signature could successfully divide patients into high-risk and low-risk groups in both sets.


CONCLUSION
This study indicated that the proposed radiomics signature could be a useful image marker to predict the therapeutic response of thoracic ESCC patients treated with CCRT.",2020,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology
Bootstrapping Lasso Estimators,"In this article, we consider bootstrapping the Lasso estimator of the regression parameter in a multiple linear regression model. It is known that the standard bootstrap method fails to be consistent. Here, we propose a modified bootstrap method, and show that it provides valid approximation to the distribution of the Lasso estimator, for all possible values of the unknown regression parameter vector, including the case where some of the components are zero. Further, we establish consistency of the modified bootstrap method for estimating the asymptotic bias and variance of the Lasso estimator. We also show that the residual bootstrap can be used to consistently estimate the distribution and variance of the adaptive Lasso estimator. Using the former result, we formulate a novel data-based method for choosing the optimal penalizing parameter for the Lasso using the modified bootstrap. A numerical study is performed to investigate the finite sample performance of the modified bootstrap. The methodology prop...",2011,Journal of the American Statistical Association
