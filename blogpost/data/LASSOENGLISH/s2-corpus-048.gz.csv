Support recovery without incoherence: A case for nonconvex regularization,"We demonstrate that the primal-dual witness proof method may be used to establish variable selection consistency and $\ell_\infty$-bounds for sparse regression problems, even when the loss function and/or regularizer are nonconvex. Using this method, we derive two theorems concerning support recovery and $\ell_\infty$-guarantees for the regression estimator in a general setting. Our results provide rigorous theoretical justification for the use of nonconvex regularization: For certain nonconvex regularizers with vanishing derivative away from the origin, support recovery consistency may be guaranteed without requiring the typical incoherence conditions present in $\ell_1$-based methods. We then derive several corollaries that illustrate the wide applicability of our method to analyzing composite objective functions involving losses such as least squares, nonconvex modified least squares for errors-in variables linear regression, the negative log likelihood for generalized linear models, and the graphical Lasso. We conclude with empirical studies to corroborate our theoretical predictions.",2014,ArXiv
"ThalassoChip, an array mutation and single nucleotide polymorphism detection tool for the diagnosis of Î²-thalassaemia","Abstract Background: The detection and diagnosis of Î²-thalassaemia for populations with molecular heterogeneity, or diverse ethnic groups, has increased the need for the development of an array high-throughput diagnostic tool that can deliver large scale genetic detection. We report on the update and validation of the ThalassoChip, a Î²-thalassaemia genetic diagnostic tool which is based on arrayed primer extension (APEX) technology. Methods: ThalassoChip slides with new and redesigned probes were prepared for testing the microarray. Six hundred and sixty DNA samples collected from eight Mediterranean countries were used for standardisation, optimisation and validation of the ThalassoChip. The Î²-globin gene region was amplified by PCR, the products were hybridised to the probes after fragmentation and the APEX reaction followed. Results: The ThalassoChip was updated with new probes and now has the ability to detect 57 Î²-globin gene mutations and three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a single test. The ThalassoChip as well as the PCR and APEX reactions were standardised and optimised using 500 DNA samples that were previously genotyped using conventional diagnostic techniques. Some probes were redesigned in order to improve the specificity and sensitivity of the test. Validation of the ThalassoChip performed using 160 samples analysed in blinded fashion showed no error. Conclusions: The updated version of the ThalassoChip is versatile, robust, cost-effective and easily adaptable, but most notably can provide comprehensive genetic diagnosis for Î²-thalassaemia and other haemoglobinopathies.

Effects of sea level rise in the United States and climate change perception in the United Kingdom,"This thesis has three separate parts. In the first part I report the first ex post study of the economic impact of sea level rise. I apply two econometric approaches to estimate the past effects of sea level rise on the economy of the USA, viz. Barro type growth regressions adjusted for spatial patterns and a matching estimator. The unit of analysis is 3063 counties of the USA. I fit growth regressions for 13 time periods and I estimate numerous varieties for both growth regressions and matching estimator. Although there is some evidence that sea level rise has a positive effect on economic growth, in most specifications the estimated effects are insignificant. Therefore, I cannot confirm the implicit assumption of previous ex-ante studies, in particular that sea level rise has in general negative effect on economies. 
 
In the second part I fit Ricardian regressions of agricultural land values for 2830 counties of the USA on past sea level rise, taking account of spatial autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity. I find a significant, hill-shaped relationship. Hence, the outcomes are mixed. Mild sea level rise increases, while more pronounced sea level rise causes land values to fall. The results are robust to a set of variations. 
 
In the third part I explore an unprecedented dataset of almost 6,000 observations to identify main predictors of climate knowledge, climate risk perception and willingness to pay (WTP) for climate change mitigation. Among nearly 70 potential explanatory variables I detect the most important ones using a multisplit lasso estimator. Importantly, I test significance of individuals' preferences about time, risk and equity. The study is innovative as these behavioural characteristics were recorded by including experimental methods into a live sample survey. This unique way of data collection combines advantages of surveys and experiments. The most important predictors of environmental attitudes are numeracy, cognitive ability, inequity aversion and political and ideological world-view.",2018,
"A simple, modified arthroscopic suture fixation of avulsion fracture of the tibial intercondylar eminence in children.","The purpose of this study was to describe a simple and modified technique for arthroscopic suture fixation in a 12-year-old boy who sustained a displaced type III intercondylar eminence of the tibial. The arthroscopic fixation was modified by using the Arthrex suture lasso device to place two nonabsorbable sutures into the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). However, the procedure became simple with the help of the Acufex ACL guide to reduce the avulsed tibial spine fragment and to place an appropriate tibial tunnel. Sutures were then passed through the tibial tunnel and secured over a bony bridge with the knee at 20Â° of flexion. At 6 months, the patient had a full range of motion with normal Lachman and anterior drawer testing, and he had returned to his daily activities. Radiographs showed complete fracture healing. Repair using the Arthrex suture lasso device provides a significant advantage in the treatment of type III and IV fractures of the tibial eminence by obtaining arthroscopic fixation with the substance of the ACL, thus eliminating the risks of comminution of the fracture fragment and hardware removal. This arthroscopic technique restores the length and integrity of the ACL, and provides a simplified, reproducible method of treatment for this injury.",2011,Journal of pediatric orthopedics. Part B
Quentin Meillassoux & de contingentie van de noodzakelijkheid van de contingentie,"Meillassouxs After Finitude, as commendable and praiseworthy this work may be, indeed escapes the correlational circle by absolutizing â€˜facticityâ€™ into â€˜factualityâ€™, but also falls into the trap of the onto-theo-logical structure of metaphysics. Non-contradiction, as speculative essence of the super-chaos, becomes the ultimate principle in Meillassouxs thought, as it constitutes the contingency of being and nothingness as contingent states within the super-chaos, and negates the possibility of a necessary being. However, we find that non-contradiction itself becomes necessary, because the super-chaos can only be contingent, by the grace of the principle of non-contradiction. 
Whereas in Heideggers thought being is â€˜transcendens schlechthinâ€™, for Meillassoux logic becomes fundamental and the principle of non-contradiction â€˜transcendens schlechthinâ€™. The principle of non-contradiction is claimed to be valid, whether reality exists, or not. Meillassoux fails to realize that being itself has to be fundamental, because the contingency of every possible being cannot be anything whatsoever, without being something, even in nothingness, because every contingent state can only be contingent because of radical contingency, which according to Meillassoux absolutely â€˜isâ€™, as only contingency itself can be called necessary. The ontic possibilities in the super-chaos: capacity-to-be, capacity-not-to-be and capacity-to-be-other, always entail being. It remains to be seen whether Speculative Materialism is capable of a noncorrelational approach of what is and must be, without ushering in a new dawn of the onto-theo-logical pitfalls of metaphysics.",2013,
Inventing the Business of Opera: The Impresario and His World in Seventeenth-Century Venice (review),"unconventional (thus, potentially confusing) policy of making editorial accidentals valid throughout the measure in which they occur, rather than applying them only to individual notes. The poetic texts are edited separately. They are accompanied by metric analyses and brief comments, but not translations. PedersÃ¸nâ€™s first madrigal book was edited by Knud Jeppesen (Dania sonans, Samfundet til udgivelse af dansk musik, ser. 4, no. 1 [Copenhagen: Levin & Munksgaard, 1933]). Another edition, edited by Jens Peter Jacobsen, includes all of PedersÃ¸nâ€™s secular vocal music (Madrigaler fra Christian IVâ€™s tid, Dania sonans 2â€“3 [Egtved: MusikhÃ¸jskolens Forlag, 1966â€“67]). The second edition was motivated both by the discovery of the Egerton manuscript in 1950 and by changes in editorial practice between 1933 and 1966. (Critical editions of music from the first half of the twentieth century retain the original clefs, while more recent editions use modern clefs.) Though it may seem uncharitable to ask why yet another edition of this music is needed, the question is unavoidable. The music presents few editorial problems, and the differences between the present edition and the edition of 1966â€“67 are slight. This edition includes a few improvements in readings, such as the emendation of the opening words of â€œLasso io prima morireâ€ to the more plausible â€œPossâ€™io prima morire.â€ The earlier edition places many editorial accidentals on the staff, rather than above the notes, and lacks separate editions of the poetic texts. The nine supplementary pieces in the present edition are not in the earlier edition; those by Di Gregorii and Franzoni are edited here for the first time. Most of the information in the introduction is readily available elsewhere, though the comparisons of PedersÃ¸nâ€™s settings with those of other composers are new. The edition is of good quality and in some ways an improvement on the earlier one, but given the high cost of critical editions of this type, and the limited budgets of research libraries (for which such editions are primarily intended), it might be wise for publishers to invest in editions of music that are not otherwise available, rather than redoing the work of the previous generation without changing it significantly.

Woman-to-Woman Marriage: Practices and Benefits in Sub-Saharan Africa,"INTRODUCTION Ethnographic studies reveal that many African societies have practiced woman-towoman marriage, and some still do (Herskovits, 1937; Krige, 1974; Obbo, 1976; O'Brien, 1977; Oboler, 1980).' Woman-to-woman marriage, also known as woman marriage or marriage involving a ""female husband,"" refers to the institution whereby a woman marries another woman and assumes control over her and her offspring (Krige, 1974:11). In most cases, the wife will bear children for the female husband. All ceremonial aspects of these marriages are observed, bridewealth is paid to the girl's father, and all rules of divorce in the society apply (Herskovits,1937:335). Despite the fact that woman-to-woman marriage has existed or exists in many societies, this institution has often been overlooked by researchers studying such topics as marriage, the family, gender relations, and the position of women in African societies. However, it is important to realize that woman-to-woman marriage has great relevance to these subjects. The theory of male dominance and female oppression in terms of gender relations has long been discussed in the literature. Claude Meillassoux (1981) claims that senior men control the labor and produce of women through their control of the marriage (see also Potash,1989:190). Such theories virtually ignore woman-to-woman marriage because the concept does not concur with the ideology of male dominance. However, another approach to the study of gender relations views both women and men as social actors who use various systems and their positions in society to achieve maximum personal benefits (Obbo, 1976:371; Potash, 1989:191). This article examines the relevance of woman-to-woman marriage as a strategy that women use to further their social and economic positions in society. Cross-culturally, women take wives under three circumstances, all of which increase the status of the female husband: ) barren women and widows take wives to obtain rights over children produced; 2) rich women accumulate wives to gain prestige and wealth in the same way men do through polygyny; and 3) in some societies where women have the right to have a daughter-in-law, women without sons can exercise their right to a daughterin-law by marrying a woman and giving her to a non-existent son (see Huber, 1969; Krige, 1974). In each of these situations, African women are able to manipulate the existing system through woman-to-woman marriage in order to achieve higher social and economic status. Woman-to-woman marriage can also be beneficial to persons other than the female husband. Woman-to-woman marriage involves the following persons: ) the female husband herself; 2) if the female husband is already married, her own husband (the female husband's husband); 3) the woman who is married by the female husband-the wife; and 4) the lover(s) of the wife who may father her children. To obtain a full understanding of the topic, it is important to examine the motivations not only of the wife, but also those of the wife's lover(s) and the husband (if any) of the female husband. This article will examine the various forms of woman-to-woman marriage in subSaharan Africa, discussing how each form can or could have been utilized by the female husband in order to advance her social and economic status in society. In addition, the benefits of woman-to-woman marriage to the other players involved will be examined. BACKGROUND ON WOMAN-TO-WOMAN MARRIAGE The institution of woman-to-woman marriage, which has existed at least as early as the eighteenth century (O'Brien, 1977:109), still exists in some societies today. However, as the Christian church banned polygamists (male and female) from taking communion during colonial times and Western influences have emphasized that girls have the right to choose their own husbands, woman-to-woman marriage may be dying out (Krige,1974:17; Amadiume,1987:132). For example, a recent study of the Western Igbo shows that women are becoming less tolerant of woman-to-woman marriage. â€¦",1998,Journal of Comparative Family Studies
"Los peces del arrecife de Cabo Pulmo, Golfo de California, MÃ©xico: Lista sistemÃ¡tica y aspectos de abundancia y biogeografÃ­a","The Cabo Pulmo reef is the most important coral formation of the Gulf of California; however, its ichthyological fauna has been poorly studied. To produce a systematic list with data on relative abundance and frequency, and biogeographical affinities, we relied on visual census, field observations, analysis of commercial and sport fisheries (from 1986 to 1998), and the literature. A total of 236 species have been recorded at Cabo Pulmo (155 genera and 60 families). This number doubles previous compilations and represents 65.1 % of aH reef fishes known from the Gulf of California, and about 35% of its entire shallow-water fishes. Of the total species number, 68.3% are from the Panamic Province, 11.0% Indo Pacific colonizers and the same percentage gulf endemics, 7.6% are circumtropical, 1.7% Atlantic and 0.5% cosmopolitan; none are endemic to the reef. The most abundant taxa are the Jabrids Thalassoma lucasanum , T grammaticum and the pomacentrid Chromis atrilobata . Only eleven species (4.7% of total) appeared in 75% to 100% of census, and 36 (15.3% oi"" total) had high levels of both abundance and frequency, evidencing that the community is dominated by few taxa. Local species richness exceeds the number reported for most rocky or coral reefs of the Pacific coast of Mexico. and indicates that Cabo Pulmo is a key area in the gulf and the entire Mexican Pacific, from the ichthyolC1gical point of view.",2000,Revista De Biologia Tropical
Regularization and Noise Injection for Improving Genetic Network Models,"The most fundamental problem in genetic network modeling is generally known as the dimensionality problem. Typical time-course gene expression data sets contain measurements of thousands of genes taken over fewer than twenty time-steps. A large dynamic network cannot be learned from data with such a limited number of time-steps without the use of additional constraints, preferably derived from biological knowledge. In this chapter, we present an approach that can nd rough estimates of the underlying genetic network based on limited time-course gene expression data by employing the fact that gene expression measurements are relatively noisy and genetic networks are thought to be robust. The method expands the data set by adding noisy duplicates, thereby simultaneously tackling the dimensionality problem and making the solutions more robust against (the already large) noise in the data. For linear models, this concept is strongly related to shrinkage methods, such as ridge regression and lasso regression, and in the limiting case equivalent to the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. The strength of the proposed concept of noise injection lies, however, in the fact that it can be employed to any modelling approach, including non-linear models.",2006,
[Peritoneal tuberculosis and HIV infection. Reflection apropos of 22 cases at the National Hospital of Bobo Dioulasso].,"Peritonitis tuberculosis is still a frequently encountered pathology in our hospital. Since the AIDS pandemic, cases of peritonitis tuberculosis present increasingly atypical characteristics, largely diverging from classical descriptions. The authors report on 22 cases of peritonitis tuberculosis associated with HIV infection. The study was carried out from June 1997 to December 1999 in the National Hospital Centre Souro SANOU of the Bobo Dioulasso internal office. It concerned 10 women and 12 men of a mean age of 37.9 years. The sex-ratio was 1.2 in favour of men. Diagnosis was established by laparoscopy. Peritonitis tuberculosis associated with HIV accounted for 78.5% of peritonitis tuberculosis cases. The clinical picture was dominated by isolated ascite (100%) associated with an oscillating high fever in 68.2% of cases. Negative results for IDR seemed to reflect poor prognosis. Response to treatment was slow but acceptable. The general prognosis was poor with a mortality rate of 18%.",2001,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique
P2YACâˆ’-receptor agonists enhance the proliferation of rat C6 glioma cells through activation of the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase,"Extracellularly added P1,P3-di(adenosine-5â€²) triphosphate (Ap3A), P1,P4-di(adenosine-5â€²) tetraphosphate (Ap4A), ATP, ADP, AMP and adenosine are growth inhibitory for rat C6 glioma cells. Analysis of nucleotide hydrolysis and the use of nucleotidase inhibitors demonstrated that the latter inhibition is due to hydrolysis of the nucleotides to adenosine. 
 
 
Agonists of the P2YACâˆ’-receptor enhance the growth of C6 cells if their hydrolysis to adenosine is inhibited by pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2â€²,4â€²-disulfonic acid (PPADS). In these conditions, the potency to stimulate cell growth parallels the ranking of the receptor agonists, i.e. 2-methylthioadenosine-5â€²-diphosphate (2MeSADP)>Ap3A>Ap4A. ATP and ADP are still hydrolysed in the presence of PPADS and have no proliferative effect on C6 cells. 
 
 
The enhanced growth is due to a P2YACâˆ’-receptor-mediated activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as shown by immunoblotting and protein kinase assays for active MAPK and the use of the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059. 
 
 
The UTP-induced enhancement of the growth of C6 cells is due to activation of MAPK by a PPADS sensitive nucleotide receptor. 
 
 
In conclusion, the effect of nucleotides on the growth of C6 cells is determined by ecto-nucleotidases and by activation of nucleotide receptors. Hydrolysis of nucleotides to adenosine induces growth inhibition while inhibition of the hydrolysis of agonists of the P2YACâˆ’-receptor enhances cell growth by activation of MAPK.

Introduction 
Nucleotides, and in particular ATP and adenosine, have been reported to affect the proliferation of different cell types. The effects are not always unequivocal, e.g. ATP stimulates the proliferation of primary cultures of astrocytes and rat aortic smooth muscle cells (Abbracchio et al., 1994; Harper et al., 1998), is ineffective on the growth of transformed mouse fibroblasts (Weisman et al., 1988) and has an inhibitory effect on the growth of several human tumour cell lines (Seetulsingh-Goorah & Stewart, 1998; Rapaport et al., 1983). Adenosine has a growth inhibitory effect on most of the examined cell types (Seetulsingh-Goorah & Stewart, 1998; Fishman et al., 1998), although a growth stimulation is also reported (Lelievre et al., 1998). This apparent discrepancy may be explained by the existence of several mechanisms that take place at the cell surface: firstly, extracellular nucleotides are degraded by a cascade of cell surface-bound enzymes, i.e. ecto-ATPase, ecto-apyrase, ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase I (NPPase) and ecto-5â€²-nucleotidase, hydrolysing ATP into ADP, AMP and adenosine (Zimmermann, 1996). Cellular uptake of the latter by adenosine transporters can induce an adenosine-dependent pyrimidine starvation resulting in inhibition of proliferation (Lasso de la Vega et al., 1994). Secondly, the added nucleotides and their breakdown products affect cell proliferation by activation of nucleotide receptors, coupled to phospolipase C (PLC) or adenylate cyclase (AC). In addition, ATP may activate ecto-protein kinases that modulate the activity of autocrine growth factors and growth inhibitors (Vilgrain & Baird, 1991; Friedberg et al., 1995). The inhibitory effect of ATP and other adenosine phosphates on cell proliferation may be explained by one or a combination of these mechanisms. 
 
Two main classes of nucleotide receptors, P1 and P2, have been described (Burnstock, 1978). The P1-receptors are mainly responsive to adenosine. The P1-receptor subtypes A1 and A3 are negatively, and A2 is positively coupled to AC. The P2-receptors, activated by ATP/ADP or UTP/UDP, are subdivided in metabotropic P2Y- and ionotropic P2X- receptors. P2Y-receptors are coupled to a PLC-dependent Ca2+ mobilization and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or to AC (P2Y11, P2Y12), while activation of the P2X-receptors, ligand gated ion-channels, generate a Ca2+-influx (Fredholm et al., 1994; Communi et al., 1997; Boeynaems et al., 2000; Hollopeter et al., 2001). 
 
We investigated the effect of adenosine and its mono- and dinucleotides on the proliferation of rat C6 glioma cells. The latter is a bipotential cell line often used as a model system for astrocytes. Several purinergic receptors are reported to be present on C6 cells: an A2b-receptor, a â€˜nucleotide receptor' coupled to PLC and activated by all nucleoside triphosphates, a PLC-coupled P2Y6-receptor activated by UDP, and a P2Y-receptor negatively coupled to AC presumed to be the P2Y12-receptor (Ohkubo et al., 2001; Lin & Chuang, 1994; Nicholas et al., 1996; Boyer et al., 1993; Hollopeter et al., 2001). The agonist potency of the latter AC-coupled receptor is more or less the same as that of the P2Y1-receptor and has hitherto been called the P2Y1-like receptor (Albert et al., 1997; Grobben et al., 2000). However, in contrast to the P2Y1-receptor, this receptor is not coupled to PLC and it is not sensitive to the antagonists PPADS (pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2â€²,4â€²-disulfonic acid) and 5â€²-phosphoadenosine 3â€²-phosphate (Boyer et al., 1994). Although Webb et al. (1996) concluded that the P2Y1-like- and the P2Y1-receptor are identical but coupled to a different second messenger system, Schachter et al. (1997) disproved this finding. To describe more accurately the pharmacological properties of the P2Y1-like receptor we propose the name P2YACâˆ’ for future reference to this receptor. The recently cloned P2Y12-receptor has been proposed to be present on C6 glioma cells (Hollopeter et al., 2001). However, ATP, an antagonist for the P2Y12-receptor, is an agonist for the P2YACâˆ’-receptor (Grobben et al., 2000), suggesting that P2Y12 and P2YACâˆ’ are different receptors. When the P2YACâˆ’-receptor is cloned and appears to be a unique receptor, and not the P2Y1-receptor coupled to a different second messenger system, the P2Yn nomenclature can be used. 
 
In this study we examined the effect of adenosine nucleotides on the growth of C6 cells. Both growth inhibitory and proliferative effects were observed, depending on whether the added adenosine nucleotides were hydrolysed by ecto-nucleotidases or not. Hydrolysis to adenosine proved to be essential for growth inhibition. We previously studied the hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides, and identified NPPase as the main ATP hydrolysing ecto-enzyme of C6 cells (Grobben et al., 1999). When nucleotide hydrolysis was inhibited by PPADS, an enhanced proliferation was observed for all potent agonists of the P2YACâˆ’-receptor, except for ADP and to a lesser extent ATP, which are hydrolysed even in the presence of PPADS. The enhanced proliferation is due to a P2YACâˆ’-receptor-mediated activation of p42/44 MAPK.",2001,British Journal of Pharmacology
"Racial Violence, ""Primitive"" Music, and the Blues Entrepreneur: W. C. Handy's Mississippi Problem","Composer of the best-selling ""Memphis Blues"" and ""St. Louis Blues,"" author of an autobiography titled Father of the Blues (1941), W. C. Handy (1873-1958) has a curious place in the history of American blues music. He was not, after all, a bluesman; he was a pre-jazz cornetist and bandleader, a skilled sight-reader and arranger who plied his trade on the black minstrel-show circuit of the 1890s. Educated to be a schoolteacher, a member of Florence, Alabama's, black elite, Handy scandalized his family, at least at first, with his willful class descent into show business. ""A box,"" his father famously gasped when young William showed him a guitar he'd purchased with saved-up pennies. ""A guitar! One of the devil's playthings. Take it away. Take it away, I tell you. Get it out of your hands. Whatever possessed you to bring a sinful thing like that into our Christian home?"" But scandalizing one's family with socially retrograde behavior and earning professional and scholarly respect as a foundational blues figure are two different things. The black press may have crowned Handy ""Daddy of the Blues"" as early as 1919, but his reputation has long been shadowed by the parallel charge that Handy was a Great Imposter. ""Mr. Handy cannot prove anything in music that he has created,"" fumed New Orleans jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton in an infamous open letter to Downbeat magazine after hearing Handy described in a 1938 Ripley's Believe It or Not! radio broadcast as ""the father of Jazz"" as well as blues. ""He has possibly taken advantage of some unprotected material that floats around.... [T]hese untruthful statements Mr. Handy has made, or caused you to make, will maybe cause him to be branded the most dastardly imposter in the history of music."" ""Even to claim, or accept, the title Father of the Blues, as Handy has done,"" wrote jazz historian Rudi Blesh in Shining Trumpets (1946), ""is as absurd as it is presumptuous.... [Handy,] from the time of his youth [seems] to have been in the un-Negroid tradition ... a tradition that has always aimed at `disinfecting' Afro-American music by `Europeanizing' it."" Literary critics, too, have had their dismissive say. Father of the Blues, argues Houston A. Baker, is ""only a simplistic detailing of a progress, describing, as it were, the elevation of a `primitive' folk ditty to the status of `art' in America."" (1) W. C. Handy as an absurd, presumptuous, simplistic, dastardly impostor? Not since Papa Hemingway, perhaps, has an acknowledged cultural father-figure accumulated such a body of parricidal commentary. Mistaken as Morton, Blesh, and Baker are about Handy's true status as the pivotal first textual consolidator of an emergent blues form, their charges nevertheless contain a grain of truth. Handy's claim on blues music does, in fact, rest on a kind of cultural appropriation, what might be called his ""Mississippi problem."" But it also rests--and this is poorly understood--on a familiarity with, and felt subjection to, racist southern violence and demagoguery of much the same sort that marked the lives of the ""real"" bluesmen whose music he appropriated. Before coming to Mississippi in 1903, Handy had spent most of the preceding seven years on the road with Mahara's Minstrels, a white-owned black troupe. He and his fellow professionals had come into repeated contact with lynch mobs (in Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee) and other racial violence, deadly or merely humiliating: white men who shot at the black minstrels and their private Pullman coach, white boys who lassoed them and threw rocks at their drums and tubas while they were parading through small southern towns. In Tyler, Texas, where the minstrels and their female associates were quarantined on threat of mass lynching during a smallpox scare, Handy and trombonist Will Garland opposed their guards with rifles to ensure that the women would be allowed to walk the railroad tracks down to the nearby woods and relieve themselves unaccosted. â€¦",2002,Southern Cultures
Home range areas and activity centres in six species of Caribbean wrasses (Labridae),"In six Caribbean wrasse (Labridae) species: Halichoeres bivittatus, Halichoeres garnoti, Halichoeres maculipinna, Halichoeres poeyi, Halichoeres radiatus and Thalassoma bifasciatum, home range area (A HR ) was positively correlated with fish total length (L T ) and this relationship was not significantly different among H. bivittatus, H. garnoti, H. radiatus and T. bifasciatum. The data for three of these species (H. radiatus was excluded because only juveniles were investigated) were pooled and the relationship between L T and A HR was analysed for juveniles and initial phase (IP) adults separately. This analysis found that once individuals of these two species become IP adults, the A HR reached a plateau, despite continued fish growth. In a separate analysis including all six wrasse species, after accounting for differences in L T using ANOVA, it was found that IP adults required larger areas than juveniles, and terminal phase (TP) adults required larger A HR than IP adults. Upon analysis of the distribution of activity throughout A HR for all species studied, it was found that 50% of the observation points (defined as the activity centre) were found in 13 to 24% of the A HR .",2005,Journal of Fish Biology
Principles of the structure-metabolism model for calculating the internal exposure of thyroid irradiated by iodine radioisotopes,"Modification to the traditional model for calculation of internal doses of human thyroid exposure is suggested. The modification is based on using autoradiographic data on spatial distribution of some iodine radioisotopes incorporated into thyroid cellular structures of test amimals, the data having been obtained by Dr.Yuri A.Classovsky. It's supposed, that during thyroid irradiation the radiological effect is defined not by ""average dose for organ"" but by ""dose for parenchyma"". In new dose model it 's suggested to consider two periods of iodine radioisotope metabolism in thyroid: (1) iodine transportation into follicular colloid; (2) iodine concentration in follicular colloid. Duration of iodine radioisotopes transportation through parenchyma till maximum accumulation in colloid may be evaluated by 24 hours. At this period the main share of energy emission in thyroid (more then 85%) occurs for short-lived iodine radioisotopes 132I) 134^ I35j) a D O U t half of energy emission for I and only 10% for I. The distribution of iodine radioisotopes in thyroid structure (colloid, parenchyma) may be considered uniform as average for this period. The uniform distribution causes uniform structure irradiation and, consequently, dose for parenchyma may be characterized by average dose for organ. Second period is characterized by nonuniform distribution of iodine radioisotopes. This causes microgradients of dose field in thyroid structure. Doses are higher in colloid, where iodine radioisotopes concentrate, then in parenchyma. I.e., average dose for parenchyma is less then average dose for organ in second period. Nonuniformity of dose field and dose reduction for parenchyma as comparison with average dose for organ are depended on iodine radioisotope physics characters and on thyroid structure-anatomical parameters determined particularly by age. Numeric values of dose coefficients for relative effectiveness of iodine radioisotopes with mass numbers of 132, 133, 134 and 135 as compared to iodine-131 incorporated into human thyroid have been determined.",1997,

A novel Bayesian lasso model based on spatial-correlated sparsity for semisupervised hyperspectral unmixing,"This paper proposes a novel Bayesian Lasso model with spatially related sparsity for hyperspectral linear unmixing. Based on the sparsity hypothesis and the spatial correlation between pixels, we introduce Lasso penalty and spatially constrained prior distributions to the original Beyesian model. This prior information takes into consideration that different regions in the hyperspectral possess various sparse level and the pixels in a same region tends to share a similar mixed level. We assign relatively slighter constraint to the transition areas which generally have higher mixed levels, by measuring spatial correlation adapting to the prior of abundance vector. Empirical experiments show attractive results of the proposed method via extensive simulation studies and comparisons with other algorithms.",2017,2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
Improved Support Recovery Guarantees for the Group Lasso With Applications to Structural Health Monitoring,"This paper considers the problem of estimating an unknown high dimensional signal from noisy linear measurements, {when} the signal is assumed to possess a \emph{group-sparse} structure in a {known,} fixed dictionary. We consider signals generated according to a natural probabilistic model, and establish new conditions under which the set of indices of the non-zero groups of the signal (called the group-level support) may be accurately estimated via the group Lasso. Our results strengthen existing coherence-based analyses that exhibit the well-known ""square root"" bottleneck, allowing for the number of recoverable nonzero groups to be nearly as large as the total number of groups. We also establish a sufficient recovery condition relating the number of nonzero groups and the signal to noise ratio (quantified in terms of the ratio of the squared Euclidean norms of nonzero groups and the variance of the random additive {measurement} noise), and validate this trend empirically. Finally, we examine the implications of our results in the context of a structural health monitoring application, where the group Lasso approach facilitates demixing of a propagating acoustic wavefield, acquired on the material surface by a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, into antithetical components, one of which indicates the locations of internal material defects.",2017,ArXiv
American Original: A Life of Will Rogers,"Hailed by The New York Times as ""America's Aristophanes,"" Will Rogers was one of this century's most astute and beloved humorists. If as he often remarked, he never met a man he didn't like, it is also true that Rogers never met a man he didn't like to make fun of. Everyone from congressmen and Presidents to Hollywood movie moguls and wealthy industrialists bore the brunt of his gently lacerating wit-and seemed, mostly, to be charmed in the process. So popular did Rogers become-through dozens of films, a daily column that ran for nine years in newspapers across the country, and countless lectures and stage performances-that he was often urged to run for Congress and even the Presidency. Upon receiving a mock appointment as Congressman-at-Large for the whole United States, Rogers protested, ""I regret the disgrace that's been thrust upon me here tonight. I've tried to live my whole life so that I would never become a congressman."" In American Original, Ray Robinson chronicles the trajectory of Will Rogers' remarkable life. Written with engaging immediacy and filled with a wealth of delightful anecdotes, this lively portrait follows Rogers from his childhood in the Indian Territory of what is now Oklahoma, to his first spellbinding lariat performances in the Wild West shows (where he would often lasso prominent audience members and drag them on stage), to his stardom in vaudeville and the Ziegfeld Follies, to his early silent movies and the later ""talkies,"" and finally to his astonishing influence as a ""cowboy philosopher"" columnist read by over 40 million Americans. Far more than other biographers, Robinson excels at conveying Rogers' impact as a political commentator (""I belong to no organized political party. I am a Democrat."") and his great success as an actor in Hollywood, where he was the leading star of Fox Films. And along the way, Robinson paints a vibrant portrait of one of America's most colorful eras. We follow the early evolution of modern entertainment, enjoy vivid snapshots of W.C. Fields, Charlie Chaplin, Florenz Ziegfeld, Eddie Cantor, Samuel Goldwyn, Shirley Temple, and John Ford, and, perhaps most important, witness the major political events of the era through Will Rogers' uniquely perceptive eyes. American Original succeeds most appealingly in bringing Will Rogers before us with all the spontaneity, intimacy, and honesty of a live performance. In it we are given front row seats to the life of a character unabashedly American and unforgettably original.",1996,
Detecting single-nucleotide polymorphism by single-nucleotide polymorphism interactions in rheumatoid arthritis using a two-step approach with machine learning and a Bayesian threshold least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model,"The objective of this study was to detect interactions between relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Data from Problem 1 of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 were used. These data consisted of 868 cases and 1,194 controls genotyped with the 500 k Illumina chip. First, machine learning methods were applied for preselecting SNPs. One hundred SNPs outside the HLA region and 1,500 SNPs in the HLA region were preselected using information-gain theory. The software weka was used to reduce colinearity and redundancy in the HLA region, resulting in a subset of 6 SNPs out of 1,500. In a second step, a parametric approach to account for interactions between SNPs in the HLA region, as well as HLA-nonHLA interactions was conducted using a Bayesian threshold least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model incorporating 2,560 covariates. This approach detected some main and interaction effects for SNPs in genes that have previously been associated with RA (e.g., rs2395175, rs660895, rs10484560, and rs2476601). Further, some other SNPs detected in this study may be considered in candidate gene studies.",2009,BMC Proceedings
Conveyer-Belt Tectonics and Geologic Evolution of Alaska's Eastern Interior: ABSTRACT,"From the Coleen-Old Crow highlands south to the Yukon River, Alaska's eastern interior is a geologic collage of northeast-trending slivers which have been displaced in conveyer-belt fashion since the Jurassic along a trans-Arctic shear system which extends to the eastern end of the Arctic archipelago. Rock sequences of the region have remarkable affinities with the North Slope and Arctic island assemblages, suggesting a common origin in the Arctic Ocean region. Pre-Cretaceous rocks can be attributed to four successive paleotectonic phases: (1) Cambrian through Lower Devonian carbonate rocks and shales are shelf-slope-basin sequences recording passive subsidence of an Atlantic-type shelf margin; (2) Middle through Upper Devonian siliceous black shales and turbidites document trench development and associated folding, uplift, and reworking of deep-sea sediments, a dramatic change ascribed to oceanic plate subduction; (3) Upper Paleozoic rocks are extremely varied and include acid intrusives and metamorphic rocks, as well as a spectrum of sedimentary deposits ranging from deep marine to fluvial. Collectively, they are attributed to a major period of orogenic uplift; and (4) early Mesozoic rocks are dominantly post-orogenic molassoid clastics. > End_Page 743------------------------------ The transcurrent movements which transported these sequences into Alaska and contiguous Yukon probably began in the Cretaceous as a result of southwesterly Arctic plate motion. Simultaneously, however, northwesterly translation of cordilleran elements interfered with this movement, causing complex dovetailing of geologic blocks and the evolution of a curious, but systematic pattern of orogenic uplifts. Thermal activity associated with these uplifts has locally reduced the originally high petroleum potential of the region. End_of_Article - Last_Page 744------------",1980,AAPG Bulletin
Development and validation of a predictive model of acute glucose response to exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes,"BackgroundOur purpose was to develop and test a predictive model of the acute glucose response to exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes.Design and methodsData from three previous exercise studies (56 subjects, 488 exercise sessions) were combined and used as a development dataset. A mixed-effects Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO) was used to select predictors among 12 potential predictors. Tests of the relative importance of each predictor were conducted using the Lindemann Merenda and Gold (LMG) algorithm. Model structure was tested using likelihood ratio tests. Model accuracy in the development dataset was assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation.Prospectively captured data (47 individuals, 436 sessions) was used as a test dataset. Model accuracy was calculated as the percentage of predictions within measurement error. Overall model utility was assessed as the number of subjects with â‰¤1 model error after the third exercise session. Model accuracy across individuals was assessed graphically. In a post-hoc analysis, a mixed-effects logistic regression tested the association of individualsâ€™ attributes with model error.ResultsMinutes since eating, a non-linear transformation of minutes since eating, post-prandial state, hemoglobin A1c, sulfonylurea status, age, and exercise session number were identified as novel predictors. Minutes since eating, its transformations, and hemoglobin A1c combined to account for 19.6% of the variance in glucose response. Sulfonylurea status, age, and exercise session each accounted for <1.0% of the variance. In the development dataset, a model with random slopes for pre-exercise glucose improved fit over a model with random intercepts only (likelihood ratio 34.5, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Cross-validated model accuracy was 83.3%.In the test dataset, overall accuracy was 80.2%. The model was more accurate in pre-prandial than postprandial exercise (83.6% vs. 74.5% accuracy respectively). 31/47 subjects had â‰¤1 model error after the third exercise session. Model error varied across individuals and was weakly associated with within-subject variability in pre-exercise glucose (Odds ratio 1.49, 95% Confidence interval 1.23-1.75).ConclusionsThe preliminary development and test of a predictive model of acute glucose response to exercise is presented. Further work to improve this model is discussed.",2013,Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome
Fishing Practices of Early Holocene Coastal California : Preliminary Evidence from Daisy Cave ( Ca-smi-261 ),"Native peoples of coastal California were highly skilled at fishing in numerous marine habitats, and for many historic and Late Holocene people fish were a focal point of the subsistence economy. The dietary significance of fish varied considerably both spatially and temporally throughout the region, however, a product of the wide variety of ecological niches, differential availability of subsistence resources, and changes in demography, technology, and food preferences. A large body of data on native California fishing practices has been assembled, but we still know relatively little about Early and Middle Holocene fishing. Forthcoming works by Erlandson et al. (1999), Rick (1999), Rick and Erlandson (1 999), Rick and Glassow (1999), Vellanoweth and Erlandson (1999), and Vellanoweth et al. (1999) should help fill this gap. However, the lack of data on early fishing practices still presents a significant limitation on discussions of the evolution of maritime adaptations in the region. In this paper, we present data on a collection of over 3000 fish remains from a 1 x 0.5 m test unit (E7) excavated in Early Holocene deposits at CA-SMI-261 (Daisy Cave) on San Miguel Island (Figure 1). We describe the assemblage, assess the technology used in fishing, season of capture, and habitats exploited, then briefly compare the Daisy Cave fishery with other Early Holocene sites from the Santa Barbara Channel region. We begin with a brief discussion of previous models of the evolution of native California fisheries.",2011,
On the MSE Properties of Empirical Bayes Methods for Sparse Estimation,"Abstract Popular convex approaches for sparse estimation such as Lasso and Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) can be derived in a Bayesian setting, starting from a particular stochastic model. In problems where groups of variables have to be estimated, we show that the same probabilistic model, under a suitable marginalization, leads to a different non-convex estimator where hyperparameters are optimized. Theoretical arguments, independent of the correctness of the priors entering the sparse model, are included to clarify the advantages of our non-convex technique in comparison with MKL and the group version of Lasso under assumption of orthogonal regressors.",2012,IFAC Proceedings Volumes
"Karoo thorn, 'Vachellia (Acacia) karroo': A state prohibited weed close to eradication","Karoo thorn, 'Vachellia (Acacia) karroo' (Hayne) Banfi and Galasso, a thorny tree from Africa, was declared a State prohibited weed in Victoria under the 'Catchment and Land Protection Act 1994' in May 2003. State prohibited weeds are to be targeted with eradication from Victoria by the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (DEDJTR). In Victoria, Karoo thorn has only been detected as a very rarely planted tree in botanic gardens, zoos, parks, and a few other situations. The species has not been recorded as naturalised in Victoria, nor has it been recorded as being traded in the state. With nearly all known sites considered eradicated in recent years by DEDJTR, there are now only two known infested sites left in Victoria, and each of these has a 'monitoring-only' status. Further, no new sites have been detected in Victoria since 2004, despite this species having been targeted for detection by the Weed Spotters network for the last 10 years. The two remaining 'monitoring-only' sites are likely to be progressively deemed eradicated as their 'monitoring-only' period ends over the next few years. In Victoria, this species shows a very promising trend towards eradication, a target that is considered easier to achieve in this case than with many other weeds due to the favourable characteristics of the species and the nature of its incursion.",2015,Plant protection quarterly
Community-Based Group Graphical Lasso,"A new strategy for probabilistic graphical modeling is developed that draws parallels to community detection analysis. The method jointly estimates an undirected graph and homogenous communities of nodes. The structure of the communities is taken into account when estimating the graph and at the same time, the structure of the graph is accounted for when estimating communities of nodes. The procedure uses a joint group graphical lasso approach with community detection-based grouping, such that some groups of edges cooccur in the estimated graph. The grouping structure is unknown and is estimated based on community detection algorithms. Theoretical derivations regarding graph convergence and sparsistency, as well as accuracy of community recovery are included, while the methodâ€™s empirical performance is illustrated in an fMRI context, as well as with simulated examples.",2020,
"Metopelloides paguri sp. nov., a new species of symbiotic stenothoid amphipod (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Stenothoidae) associated with sublittoral hermit crabs from the Russian coasts of the Sea of Japan","A new species of amphipod from the genus Metopelloides Gurjanova, 1938 (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Stenothoidae) asso-ciated with two species of sublittoral hermit crab species, Pagurus pectinatus (Stimpson, 1858) and Elassochirus cavi- manus (Miers, 1879) (Crustacea: Decapoda: Paguridae), is described from the Russian coasts of the Sea of Japan. The newspecies clearly differs from the congeners by the combination of morphological features such as telson without lateralspines, an elongated mandibular palp with single apical setae, the structures of distoventral palmar margins of subchelaon gnathopods I and II in females, bright white-red body coloration.

Grouped Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for Variable Selection and Prediction,"We consider the problem of variable group selection for least squares regression, namely, that of selecting groups of variables for best regression performance, leveraging and adhering to a natural grouping structure within the explanatory variables. We show that this problem can be efficiently addressed by using a certain greedy style algorithm. More precisely, we propose the Group Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm (Group-OMP), which extends the standard OMP procedure (also referred to as ""forward greedy feature selection algorithm"" for least squares regression) to perform stage-wise group variable selection. We prove that under certain conditions Group-OMP can identify the correct (groups of) variables. We also provide an upperbound on the lâˆž norm of the difference between the estimated regression coefficients and the true coefficients. Experimental results on simulated and real world datasets indicate that Group-OMP compares favorably to Group Lasso, OMP and Lasso, both in terms of variable selection and prediction accuracy.",2009,

"Stratigraphic palynology of Obi (Lafia), Plateau State of Nigeria","Abstract The Obiâ€”Lafia area is part of the Benue Valley where the Nigerian Steel Development Authority is currently involved in exploration for coal. Boreholes in the area range between 200â€“500 m. The rock units are mainly shales, sandstones, limestones and coal with transitional zones in between. The stratigraphy of this area is based on palynological studies using the constituent miospores. Quantitative analysis of the miospores shows that the total number of species per sample is less than 100. However, the following have been identified in this area: Araucariacites, Classopollis classoides, Tricolpites, Tricolpoporopollenites, Matonisporites, Syncolporites form A, Monocolpopollenites, Triorites, Ephedripites, Granulatisporites, Droseridites senonicus, Cicatricosisporites . Marine palynomorphs (dinoflagellates and microforaminifera) are also present, but the stratigraphic zonation and age determination are based on miospores. Three assemblage zones based on some index miospores have been established. Also recognised are the three Senonian substages, (1) Coniacian (2) Santonian (3) Campanian.",1982,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
Exploiting Joint Array and Spatial Sparsity for Broadband Source Localisation with Fisher Information Matrix Constraints,"Source localisation, such as direction of arrival (DoA) estimation, is an important issue in a number of applications such as underwater acoustic detection, target tracking and environmental monitoring [1] [2]. The key to successful source localisation lies in the reliable extraction of useful information about the states of targets from the observations, which are collected by acoustic transducers, often operated in a noisy environment [2] [3]. Due to the constraints on computation resources, sensing range, communication bandwidth, and energy consumption, it is usually desirable not to use all the sensors in the array to report their measurements at all the time instants [4] [5] [6] [7]. This leads to the problem of sparse array optimisation and sensor selection, which seeks to activate a subset of sensors at different time to optimize the tracking performance under the given constraints. In this paper, we focus on the problem of using as few sensors as possible to achieve DoA estimation at each sampling time. Traditionally, DoA estimation is addressed by methods, such as Capon beamformer, high-resolution and multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm [8] [9] [10]. Recently, spatial sparsity based optimisation, which aims at extracting meaningful lower-dimensional information from high-dimensional data [11], has attracted great interests. Based on compressive sensing (CS) theory [12], the DoAs can be estimated by solving an optimisation problem constrained with the l1 norm of a vector of the coefficients corresponding to the source activities in the spatial domain [13], which is assumed to be sparse, implying that only a few sources are active simultaneously. In these existing works, a full array has been used. However, as pointed out earlier, it would be desirable if the spatial sparsity can be used jointly with the array sparsity so that the sources can be localised with as few sensors from the array as possible. In our previous work [14], we have proposed an optimisation method to exploit jointly the array and spatial sparsity, to achieve source detection in a subset of space using as few sensors as possible at each time instant. The method is operated in a twostep iterative process, where the first step is to find the minimum number of sensors to be used in array and the second step is to perform source localisation based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm using the selected sensors. Both stationary and moving sources are considered. The approach can be initialised at a random location and eventually finds the DoA after it converges. Figure 1 and 2 show the DoA estimations for both stationary source and moving source with noises. Although the results demonstrate satisfatory performances of the joint approach, there are still estimation noise which happen at both ends of the DoA range (+90 degrees, -90 degrees). To further improve the DoA estimation results, we consider the use of statistical information based on Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) in this joint array and spatial sparsity based optimisation framework. The FIM, which is used to calculate the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), can be defined as E{( âˆ‚logy(x) âˆ‚x )( âˆ‚logy(x) âˆ‚x ) }, where y is the received signal and x is the source direction, and (Â·) denotes the transpose of a matrix [15] [16]. The proposed algorithm is still a two-step method. In the first step, a FIM constraint here is used to limit the difference between the MLE of the received signal y and the scaled version diag(w)y where w is the sparse complex vector weight coefficient for each sensor, so that in the following stage y can be replaced by diag(w)y more strictly. The constrained l1 norm is written as â€–f(x) âˆ’ diag(w)yâ€–1 â‰¤ Î²N , where Î² âˆˆ < is a threshold to reduce the error before the observed signal is scaled by the weight coefficients, N is the number of potential sensors, f(x) is the N dimensional vector holding the values of each element in the column of F(x) and the expectation is obtained as the average values. In the second step, to improve the DoA reconstruction, a constraint is added to the LASSO function as â€–f(x)Aâˆ’ (Ax)Aâ€–1 â‰¤ Î³M , where the value of FIM is used to constrain the similarity between the DoA reconstruction and the expression of the MLE of y mapped onto the possible global source directions matrix A, Î³ âˆˆ < is a constrained parameter and M is the number of potential source directions, and (Â·) is a Hermitian operator. As a result, the DoA estimation becomes more robust. Figure 3 and 4 are the results of the narrowband DoA estimations with the FIM constrained joint approach for the moving sources without and with noise. An example of tracking from 50 degrees to -50 degrees is shown to demonstrate the preformance of the proposed joint approach, where 21 of 100 sensors are used at every sampling instant. It can be seen that the estimation errors as happened in the previous results have been reduced. We also extend this method from the narrowband to the broadband scenario. For the wideband case, the DoA estimation can be done in a similar way for J frequency bands. In the first step, the desired beam response matrix P âˆˆ CMÃ—J can be reshaped to an MJ dimensional vector, preshape âˆˆ C1Ã—(MJ). Accordingly, the dictionary matrix A is modified to Aarray âˆˆ CNÃ—(MJ). In the second step, the dictionary matrix becomes Aspatial âˆˆ C(NJ)Ã—M . Through these reshaping operations, the joint approach can be performed in a narrowband-like manner, with the FIM constraints added into the optimisation process. More results for DoA estimations for both stationary source and moving source, in both noiseless and noisy cases, will be presented in this workshop. A more detailed discussion for using the FIM will be presented, including the process to calculate the MLE via the FIM, the possible convex optimization problem, and the problem of computing the expectation.

Incorporating predictor network in penalized regression with application to microarray data.,"We consider penalized linear regression, especially for ""large p, small n"" problems, for which the relationships among predictors are described a priori by a network. A class of motivating examples includes modeling a phenotype through gene expression profiles while accounting for coordinated functioning of genes in the form of biological pathways or networks. To incorporate the prior knowledge of the similar effect sizes of neighboring predictors in a network, we propose a grouped penalty based on the L(gamma)-norm that smoothes the regression coefficients of the predictors over the network. The main feature of the proposed method is its ability to automatically realize grouped variable selection and exploit grouping effects. We also discuss effects of the choices of the gamma and some weights inside the L(gamma)-norm. Simulation studies demonstrate the superior finite-sample performance of the proposed method as compared to Lasso, elastic net, and a recently proposed network-based method. The new method performs best in variable selection across all simulation set-ups considered. For illustration, the method is applied to a microarray dataset to predict survival times for some glioblastoma patients using a gene expression dataset and a gene network compiled from some Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways.",2010,Biometrics

Three-Month Real-Time Dengue Forecast Models: An Early Warning System for Outbreak Alerts and Policy Decision Support in Singapore,"BACKGROUND
With its tropical rainforest climate, rapid urbanization, and changing demography and ecology, Singapore experiences endemic dengue; the last large outbreak in 2013 culminated in 22,170 cases. In the absence of a vaccine on the market, vector control is the key approach for prevention.


OBJECTIVES
We sought to forecast the evolution of dengue epidemics in Singapore to provide early warning of outbreaks and to facilitate the public health response to moderate an impending outbreak.


METHODS
We developed a set of statistical models using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods to forecast the weekly incidence of dengue notifications over a 3-month time horizon. This forecasting tool used a variety of data streams and was updated weekly, including recent case data, meteorological data, vector surveillance data, and population-based national statistics. The forecasting methodology was compared with alternative approaches that have been proposed to model dengue case data (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average and step-down linear regression) by fielding them on the 2013 dengue epidemic, the largest on record in Singapore.


RESULTS
Operationally useful forecasts were obtained at a 3-month lag using the LASSO-derived models. Based on the mean average percentage error, the LASSO approach provided more accurate forecasts than the other methods we assessed. We demonstrate its utility in Singapore's dengue control program by providing a forecast of the 2013 outbreak for advance preparation of outbreak response.


CONCLUSIONS
Statistical models built using machine learning methods such as LASSO have the potential to markedly improve forecasting techniques for recurrent infectious disease outbreaks such as dengue.

Genetic parameters of growth traits of D'man sheep in Tunisia.,"INTRODUCTION The Dâ€™man breed originates from the oasis in the south of Morocco and is well known for its high prolificacy and its accelerated lambing rhythm (Lahlou-Kassi et al., 1989). Introduced in Tunisia in 1994, the Dâ€™man is being diffused in the south as pure breed and is a potential candidate for cross breeding with local breeds in other favorable areas (Lassoued and Rekik, 2001). In either case, the genetic characterization of the breed is a prerequisite step and this work addresses the main environmental factors affecting growth performances and the estimation of the genetic parameters of growth traits.",2002,
Biodiversity and biotechnological applications of halophilic microbes for sustainable agriculture,"Extreme saline environments represent unique ecosystems for novel microbial biodiversity. The salt tolerant microbiomes have been reported from diverse saline habitat. The biodiversity of salt tolerant microbes showed the presence of different groups of microbes including Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes. The salt tolerant plant growth promoting microbes such as Ammoniphilus, Arthrobacter, Azospirillum, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Brevibacterium, Haloarcula, Halobacillus, Halococcus, Haloferax, Halolamina, Halomonas, Halorubrum, Haloterrigena, Lysinibacillus, Marinobacter, Marinospirillum, Oceanobacillus, Paenibacillus, Penicillium, Pontibacillus, Pseudomonas, Sediminibacillus, Sporosarcina, Streptomyces, Thalassobacillus and Thermonema have been isolated and characterized for plant growth under the salinity stress. The halophilic microbes have ability to produce phytohormones (Indole acetic acids, gibberellic acids and cytokinin), solubilize and bind nutrients (Phosphorus, potassium, zinc and Siderophores), besides eliciting plant defense reactions against pathogens, also help in plant growth under harsh saline environments. The halophilic plant growth promoting (PGP) microbes increase the plant growth, yields and nutrient uptake under the saline condition. 
In present review the biodiversity of halophilic microbes from diverse ecosystems, its functional PGP attributes and mechanisms of action for amelioration of salt stress, plant growth and soil health for sustainable agriculture have been discussed. The salt tolerant microbes with multifarious PGP attributes could be applied for plant growth and ameliorations of salt stress.",2018,Journal of Applied Biology and Biotechnology
Heuristics as a special case of Bayesian Inference,"Heuristics as a special case of Bayesian Inference Paula Parpart University College London Matt Jones University of Colorado Boulder Brad Love University College London Keywords: ; ; ; ; ; ; ; Abstract: Probabilistic inference models (e.g. Bayesian models) are often cast as being rational and at odds with simple heuristic approaches. We show that prominent decision heuristics, take-the-best and tallying, are special cases of Bayesian inference. We developed two Bayesian learning models by extending two popular regularized regression approaches, lasso and ridge regression. The priors of these Bayesian models match the environmental structures necessary for tallying and take-the- best to succeed. Provably, the Bayesian models become equivalent to the heuristics as their priors become more extreme; hence they subsume heuristics and standard linear regression. In a re-analysis of datasets favouring heuristic approaches, we show that our Bayesian extension of ridge regression outperforms tallying and linear regression. A similar result holds for our Bayesian extension of lasso regression and the take-the-best heuristic. This indicates that true environmental structure and potentially psychological processing often lie somewhere between the assumptions of heuristic and standard regression approaches.",2014,Cognitive Science
Time Varying Quantile Lasso,"In the present chapter we study the dynamics of penalization parameter \(\lambda \) of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method proposed by Tibshirani (J Roy Stat Soc Series B 58:267â€“288, 1996) and extended into quantile regression context by Li and Zhu (J Comput Graph Stat 17:1â€“23, 2008). The dynamic behaviour of the parameter \(\lambda \) can be observed when the model is assumed to vary over time and therefore the fitting is performed with the use of moving windows. The proposal of investigating time series of \(\lambda \) and its dependency on model characteristics was brought into focus by Hardle et al. (J Econom 192:499â€“513, 2016), which was a foundation of FinancialRiskMeter. Following the ideas behind the two aforementioned projects, we use the derivation of the formula for the penalization parameter \(\lambda \) as a result of the optimization problem. This reveals three possible effects driving \(\lambda \); variance of the error term, correlation structure of the covariates and number of nonzero coefficients of the model. Our aim is to disentangle these three effects and investigate their relationship with the tuning parameter \(\lambda \), which is conducted by a simulation study. After dealing with the theoretical impact of the three model characteristics on \(\lambda \), empirical application is performed and the idea of implementing the parameter \(\lambda \) into a systemic risk measure is presented.",2016,
"Recursive <formula formulatype=""inline""><tex Notation=""TeX"">$\ell_{1,\infty}$</tex> </formula> Group Lasso","We introduce a recursive adaptive group lasso algorithm for real-time penalized least squares prediction that produces a time sequence of optimal sparse predictor coefficient vectors. At each time index the proposed algorithm computes an exact update of the optimal â„“1,âˆž-penalized recursive least squares (RLS) predictor. Each update minimizes a convex but nondifferentiable function optimization problem. We develop an on-line homotopy method to reduce the computational complexity. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the â„“1 regularized RLS algorithm for a group sparse system identification problem and has lower implementation complexity than direct group lasso solvers.",2012,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
On the Use of the Lasso for Instrumental Variables Estimation with Some Invalid Instruments,"We investigate the behavior of the Lasso for selecting invalid instruments in linear instrumental variables models for estimating causal effects of exposures on outcomes, as proposed recently by Kang etÂ al. Invalid instruments are such that they fail the exclusion restriction and enter the model as explanatory variables. We show that for this setup, the Lasso may not consistently select the invalid instruments if these are relatively strong. We propose a median estimator that is consistent when less than 50% of the instruments are invalid, and its consistency does not depend on the relative strength of the instruments, or their correlation structure. We show that this estimator can be used for adaptive Lasso estimation, with the resulting estimator having oracle properties. The methods are applied to a Mendelian randomization study to estimate the causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on diastolic blood pressure, using data on individuals from the UK Biobank, with 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms as potential instruments for BMI.

Impact of Improved Technologies on Productivity Enhancement of Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.),"Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is one of the important oilseed crops in India. The major constraint of its low productivity is non-adoption of improved technologies by the farmers. Frontline demonstrations were conducted at 45 farmersâ€™ field during 2011, 2012 and 2013, to demonstrate production potential and economic benefit of improved technologies comprising sowing method, nutrient management and chemical weed control and adoption of whole package of practices for the crop. Pre-emergence application (within two days of sowing) of weedicide Lasso 50 EC (Alachlor) at 3 litres/ha in 500 litres of water used for effective control of the weeds during kharif season in rainfed condition. The technologies improved the yield attributing traits as well as seed yield of the crop. The improved technology recorded a mean yield of 468 kg/ha which was 32% higher than that obtained with farmersâ€™ practice (355 kg/ha). Higher mean net income of 31,391/ha with a benefit: cost ratio of 2.65 was obtained with improved technologies in comparison to farmersâ€™ practice ( 23,323/ha, 2.37).",2014,Indian Journal of Dryland Agricultural Research and Development
The smooth brachiopods of the Mediterranean Jurassic: Refugees or invaders?,"Abstract The Jurassic brachiopod fauna of the Alpineâ€“Mediterranean region is dominated by smooth rhynchonellids and spiriferinids and sulcate or perforate terebratulids, in contrast to the typical coarsely ribbed brachiopods of the contemporaneous European and African epicontinental areas. The best studied example of the Mediterranean brachiopod province is the Pliensbachian fauna of the Bakony Mountains (Hungary). There the five most abundant genera are all smooth (Linguithyris, Securithyris, Apringia, Bakonyithyris, Pisirhynchia). These smooth genera represent different morphological types (sulcate, axiniform, uniplicate). Phylogenetically related forms are known from several evolutionary lineages of discontinuous record ranging from the Triassic to the Recent. The Triassicâ€“Jurassic and the Neogeneâ€“Recent parts of these evolutionary lineages are represented by several genera, while in the Late Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene interval they seemingly disappear, at least they have no record. The Recent relatives of the above Pliensbachian genera live mostly in the deep sea: three are shallow bathyal (200â€“400 m), three deep bathyal (800â€“1200 m) and three abyssal (2000â€“4500 m). The abyssal genera occur mainly in the East Pacific. The geographical distribution of the bathyal genera shows peculiar features: they are more or less confined to the western sides of the great ocean basins (West Pacific, West Indian Ocean, Caribbean region) and they are â€œthalassobathyalâ€, i.e., they are living on submarine plateaus, seamounts or island aprons and not on the continental slopes. This pattern, extrapolated to the past, shows good analogy with the Jurassic palaeogeographical model developed for the western part of the Tethys Ocean. It is hypothesized that smooth, mainly sulcate, articulate brachiopods flourished in the bathyal or even abyssal zones during the Palaeozoic; they were not refugees but formed well-adapted communities. This stable, conservative fauna may have survived the crises manifested in the shelf seas and, in cases of appropriate palaeogeographical situations, may have implanted its descendants to the shallow bathyal or even sublittoral regions of the western margins of the ocean basins. The Mediterranean microcontinent system at the western part of the Jurassic Tethys might have been such an invaded region. Correlation between plate tectonic changes of ocean/continent configurations, the presence of ocean basins closed on the west, and the occurrence of smooth articulate brachiopod groups in shallow bathyal to sublittoral settings collectively suggest that the deep-water forms invaded the shallow environments of the western Tethys in Early Mesozoic times and the W Pacific and W Indian Oceans in the Neogene. They stayed in the deep-sea reservoir when a circum-equatorial ocean existed in the Late Mesozoic.",2005,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"
Nonparametric Shrinkage estimation for Aalen's additive hazards model,"Aalen's nonparametric additive model in which the regression coefficients are assumed to be unspecified functions of time is a flexible alternative to Cox's proportional hazards model when the proportionality assumption is in doubt. In this paper, we incorporate a general linear hypothesis into the estimation of the time-varying regression coefficients. We combine unrestricted least squares estimators and estimators that are restricted by the linear hypothesis and produce James-Stein-type shrinkage estimators of the regression coefficients. We develop the asymptotic joint distribution of such restricted and unrestricted estimators and use this to study the relative performance of the proposed estimators via their integrated asymptotic distributional risks. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to examine the relative performance of the estimators in terms of their integrated mean square errors. We also compare the performance of the proposed estimators with a recently devised LASSO estimator as well as with ridge-type estimators both via simulations and data on the survival of primary billiary cirhosis patients.",2014,Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics
Prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis in pregnancy at three health centers in Burkina Faso.,"INTRODUCTION
Pregnant women are more susceptible to vaginal colonization and infection by yeast. The role of Candida colonization in the occurrence of preterm birth is well established. The knowledge of local epidemiology and identification of risk factors for preterm birth is important for the prevention and management strategies. The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of CandidaÂ sp. in vaginal swabs of pregnant women.


METHODS
Pregnant women attending routine antenatal visits in three primary health centres in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) were enrolled into a cross-sectional study carried out from February to April 2015. Vaginal swabs samples were taken from participants after obtaining oral consent. The swabs were inoculated into Sabouraud's glucose agar supplemented with chloramphenicol and incubated at 37Â°C for 24 to 48hours under aerobic conditions in order to perform fungal culture. The identification of the Candida species was done by culture on HiCrome Candida Differential Agar at 35Â°C for 48h for production of species-specific colors.


RESULTS
A total of 229Â pregnant women were included. The prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) was 22.71%, (95% CI [17.45-28.69]). CandidaÂ albicans accounted for 40.39% and non-CandidaÂ albicans species for 59.61% of the isolates, with mainly C.Â glabrata (32.69%), C.Â tropicalis (15.38%) and C.Â krusei (11.54%).


CONCLUSIONS
This study revealed a high prevalence of non-C.Â albicans species. The syndromic management guidelines for VVC in Burkina Faso will be revised to include a specific protocol for pregnant women.",2018,Journal de mycologie medicale
A Study on Domestic Drama Rating Prediction,"Abstract Audience rating competition in the domestic drama market has increased recently due to the introductionof commercial broadcasting and diversiï¬cation of channels. There is now a need for thorough studies andanalysis on audience rating. Especially, a drama rating is an important measure to estimate advertisementcosts for producers and advertisers. In this paper, we study the drama rating prediction models using variousdata mining techniques such as linear regression, LASSO regression, random forest, and gradient boosting.The analysis results show that initial drama ratings are aï¬€ected by structural elements such as broadcastingstation and broadcasting time. Average drama ratings are also inï¬‚uenced by earlier public opinion such asthe number of internet searches about the drama.Keywords: drama rating, linear regression, LASSO regression, random forest, gradient boosting, importantvariables 1. ì„œë¡  ìµœê·¼ ë“œë¼ë§ˆ ì‹œìž¥ì—ëŠ” ë‹¤ì–‘í•œ ì£¼ì œë¥¼ ë‹¤ë£¨ê³  ì—¬ëŸ¬ ìœ ëª… ë°°ìš°ë“¤ì„ìºìŠ¤íŒ…í•œ ë“œë¼ë§ˆë“¤ì´ë“±ìž¥í•˜ê³  ìžˆë‹¤.2011ë…„ ë§ ë°©ì†¡ë²•ì´ê°œì •ë¨ì— ë”°ë¼ ì¢…í•©íŽ¸ì„±ì±„ë„ì´ê°œêµ­í•œ ì´í›„ ì§€ìƒíŒŒ ë°©ì†¡ì‚¬ ì¤‘ì‹¬ì´ì—ˆë˜ ë“œë¼ë§ˆ ì‹œìž¥ì´ì¼€ì´ë¸” ë° ì¢…í•©íŽ¸ì„±ì±„ë„ê¹Œì§€ í™•ëŒ€ë˜ì—ˆìœ¼ë©° ìŠ¤ë§ˆíŠ¸í°, íƒœë¸”ë¦¿ ë“±ë“œë¼ë§ˆë¥¼ ì‹œì²­í•  ìˆ˜ìžˆëŠ” ë°©ë²•ì´ë‹¤ì–‘í™”ë˜ì—ˆë‹¤. ì´ë ‡ê²Œ ë°©ì†¡ì‹œìž¥ì´ë¹ ë¥´ê²Œ ë³€í™”í•˜ê³  ìžˆìŒì—ë„ ë¶ˆêµ¬í•˜ê³  ì‹œì²­ë¥ ì€TVë¥¼ ê¸°ë°˜ìœ¼ë¡œ í•˜ëŠ” ì „í†µì ì¸ë°©ë²•ìœ¼ë¡œ ì¸¡ì •ë˜ì–´ í”„ë¡œê·¸ëž¨ ì œìž‘ìžì™€ ê´‘ê³ ì£¼ë“¤ì—ê²Œ ê´‘ê³ ë¹„ ê·œëª¨ë¥¼ ì‚°ì •í•˜ëŠ” ë° ë§¤ìš° ì¤‘ìš”í•œ ì²™ë„ë¡œ í™œìš©ë˜ê³  ìžˆë‹¤. íŠ¹ížˆ ë“œë¼ë§ˆëŠ” ëŒ€ì¤‘ì  ì¸ê¸°ë‚˜ ê·¸ì— ë”°ë¥¸ ì‚¬íšŒì  ì˜í–¥ë ¥ì´ë¼ëŠ” ì°¨ì›ì—ì„œë‹¤ë¥¸ ì–´ë–¤ìž¥ë¥´ì˜í”„ë¡œê·¸ëž¨ë³´ë‹¤ë„ ì¤‘ìš”í•œ ì˜ë¯¸ë¥¼ ì§€ë‹ˆê¸° ë•Œë¬¸ì— (Bae, 2005) ë“œë¼ë§ˆ ì‹œì²­ë¥ ì„ì˜ˆì¸¡í•˜ëŠ” ê²ƒì€ì œìž‘ìžì™€ ê´‘ê³ ì£¼ ìž…ìž¥ì—ì„œë§¤ìš° ì¤‘ìš”í•˜ë‹¤. ë“œë¼ë§ˆ ì‹œì²­ë¥ ì— ê´€í•œ ì—°êµ¬ëŠ” ì´ë¯¸ ì˜¤ëž˜ì „ë¶€í„° ì§„í–‰ë˜ì–´ì™”ì§€ë§ŒëŒ€ë¶€ë¶„ì˜ì—°êµ¬ë“¤ì´ì¼ë°˜íšŒê·€ëª¨í˜•ì— ê¸°ë°˜í•˜ê³  ìžˆìœ¼ë©° ë¶„ì„ëŒ€ìƒì´íŠ¹ì • ë°©ì†¡ì‚¬ ë˜ëŠ” ì§€ìƒíŒŒ ë°©ì†¡ì‚¬ì˜ë“œë¼ë§ˆì— í•œì •ë˜ì–´ ìžˆë‹¤. ë³¸ ì—°êµ¬ì—ì„œëŠ” ì´ëŸ° í•œê³„ì ì„ê·¹ë³µí•˜ê³ ìžìµœê·¼ ë°©ì†¡ì‹œìž¥ì˜ë³€í™”ë¥¼ ê³ ë ¤í•œ ë‹¤ì–‘í•œ í†µê³„ì  ì˜ˆì¸¡ ëª¨í˜•ì„ì œì‹œí•˜ê³ ìží•œë‹¤.ë³¸ ì—°êµ¬ì˜ëª©ì ì€ì§€ìƒíŒŒ ë°©ì†¡ì‚¬ì™€ ì¼€ì´ë¸”, ì¢…í•©íŽ¸ì„±ì±„ë„ì„ëª¨ë‘í¬í•¨í•œ ë“œë¼ë§ˆë¥¼ ëŒ€ìƒìœ¼ë¡œ í•˜ì—¬ ë‹¤ì–‘í•œ ë°ì´í„°ë§ˆì´ë‹ ê¸°ë²•ì„í™œìš©í•œ ì‹œì²­ë¥  ì˜ˆì¸¡ ëª¨í˜•ì„ì œì‹œí•˜ê³  ì‹œì²­ë¥  ì˜ˆì¸¡ì— ì¤‘ìš”í•œ ì˜í–¥ì„ë¯¸ì¹˜ëŠ” ìš”",2015,

An application of sparse-group lasso regularization to equity portfolio optimization and sector selection,"In this paper, we propose a modified mean-variance portfolio selection model that incorporates the sparse-group lasso (abbreviated as SGLasso) regularization in machine learning. This new model essentially has three merits: first, it allows investors to incorporate their preference over equity sectors when constructing portfolios; second, it helps investors select sectors based on assetsâ€™ past performances as it encourages sparsity among sectors; third, it has stabilizing and sparsifying effect on the entire portfolio. We connect our model to a robust portfolio selection problem, and investigate effects of the SGLasso regularization on the optimal strategy both theoretically and empirically. We develop an efficient algorithm to find the optimal portfolio and prove its global convergence. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm through simulated experiments under large datasets and evaluate the out-of-sample performance of our model via empirical tests across different datasets.",2020,Annals of Operations Research

Forward stagewise regression and the monotone lasso,"We consider the least angle regression and forward stagewise algorithms for solving penalized least squares regression problems. In Efron et al. (2004) it is proven that the least angle regression algorithm, with a small modication, solves the lasso (L1 constrained) regression problem. Here we give an analogous result for incremental forward stagewise regression, showing that it ts a monotone version of the lasso. We also study a condition under which the coecien t paths of the lasso are monotone, and hence the dieren t algorithms all coincide. Finally, we compare the lasso and forward stagewise procedures in a simulation study involving a large number of correlated predictors.",2007,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Degradation of crude oil in a contaminated tidal flat area and the resilience of bacterial community.,"Crude oil spills, Hebei Spirit in South Korea, is considered as one of the worst environmental disasters of the region. Our understanding on activation of oil-degrading bacteria and resilience of microbial community in oil contaminated sites are limited due to scarcity of such event. In the present study, tidal flat sediment contaminated by the oil spill were investigated for duration of 13months to identify temporal change in microbial community and functional genes responsible for PAH-degradation. The results showed predominance of previously known oil-degrading genera, such as Cycloclasticus, Alcanivorax, and Thalassolituus, displaying significant increase within first four months of the accident. The disturbance caused by the oil spill altered the microbial community and its functional structures, but they were almost restored to the original state after 13months. Present study demonstrated high detoxification capacity of indigenous bacterial populations in the tidal flat sediments and its resilience of microbial community.",2017,Marine pollution bulletin
Radiomics signature on 3T dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for estrogen receptor-positive invasive breast cancers,"To evaluate the ability of a radiomics signature based on 3T dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish between low and non-low Oncotype DX (OD) risk groups in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive invasive breast cancers.Between May 2011 and March 2016, 67 women with ER-positive invasive breast cancer who performed preoperative 3T MRI and OD assay were included. We divided the patients into low (OD recurrence score [RS]â€Š<18) and non-low risk (RSâ€Šâ‰¥18) groups. Extracted radiomics features included 8 morphological, 76 histogram-based, and 72 higher-order texture features. A radiomics signature (Rad-score) was generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between clinicopathologic factors, MRI findings, and the Rad-score with OD risk groups, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were used to assess classification performance of the Rad-score.The Rad-score was constructed for each tumor by extracting 10 (6.3%) from 158 radiomics features. A higher Rad-score (odds ratio [OR], 65.209; Pâ€Š<.001), Ki-67 expression (OR, 17.462; Pâ€Š=â€Š.007), and high p53 (ORâ€Š=â€Š8.449; Pâ€Š=â€Š.077) were associated with non-low OD risk. The Rad-score classified low and non-low OD risk with an AUC of 0.759.The Rad-score showed the potential for discrimination between low and non-low OD risk groups in patients with ER-positive invasive breast cancers.",2019,Medicine

Variable and threshold selection to control predictive accuracy in logistic regression,"type=""main"" xml:id=""rssc12058-abs-0001""> Using data collected from the â€˜Sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depressionâ€™ study, we use logistic regression to predict whether a patient will respond to treatment on the basis of early symptom change and patient characteristics. Model selection criteria such as the Akaike information criterion AIC and mean-squared-error of prediction MSEP may not be appropriate if the aim is to predict with a high degree of certainty who will respond or not respond to treatment. Towards this aim, we generalize the definition of the positive and negative predictive value curves to the case of multiple predictors. We point out that it is the ordering rather than the precise values of the response probabilities which is important, and we arrive at a unified approach to model selection via two-sample rank tests. To avoid overfitting, we define a cross-validated version of the positive and negative predictive value curves and compare these curves after smoothing for various models. When applied to the study data, we obtain a ranking of models that differs from those based on AIC and MSEP, as well as a tree-based method and regularized logistic regression using a lasso penalty. Our selected model performs consistently well for both 4-week-ahead and 7-week-ahead predictions.",2014,Journal of The Royal Statistical Society Series C-applied Statistics
Interactions during feeding among certain coral reef fishes in Elat,"From July 1983 to March 1984 coral reef fishes in Elat (Red Sea) were fed in novel feeding situations. Thalassoma rÃ¼ppelli had the shortest latency to first feed, Chaetodon paucifasciatus had the longest latency, while Sufflamen albicaudatus, Coris aygula and Lethrinus sp. had intermediate latencies. The mean number of T. rÃ¼ppelli feeding at the beginning of experiments was higher than that of the other species. The difference decreased rapidly and disappeared within 90 s of the beginning. Latencies to first feed, and the number of fish feeding, were not correlated with the number of fish of each species in the study area. Aggression was directed predominantly by S. albicaudatus and by C. aygula towards Lethrinus sp. and T. rÃ¼ppelli. It is suggested that these species which suffer more disturbances during their feeding and which receive more aggression are more likely to approach and feed more quickly in novel feeding situations.",1986,Marine Biology
Textbook of Nephrology,"The proliferation of renal textbooks over the last decade has created in book reviewers a feeling of deja vu. The repetitive rosters of authors of particular topics and the similarity of encyclopedic approaches render choices and comparative assessment extremely difficult. A few excellent textbooks dominated the field in earlier decades, but many more are now available. Yet, despite the similarity of new textbooks covering the specialty, differences in editorial philosophy provide some important distinguishing aspects. While most renal textbooks rely on an encyclopedic approach for their relatively long chapters, the Textbook of Nephrology edited by Drs Massry and Glassock offers a distinctly different approach. The table of contents reads like a student's wish list. It promises coverage of many areas in clinical nephrology in succinct individual essays. Herein lies the real strength of this textbook, and the success of this approach is a reflection of the thoughtful planning of experienced",1989,JAMA
Ex Vivo Programming of Donor Cells Prior to Allo-HCT Reduces Gvhd without Compromising GVL,"potentially curative option for many hematologic malignancies, complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) result in significant morbidity and mortality. Conventional approaches to manage GvHD, such as prophylaxis with immunosuppressive agents or T-cell depletion strategies, are limited by increases in graft failure, viralassociated lymphoproliferative disorders, and disease relapse. Here we present a novel strategy to reduce the rates of GvHD by programming mobilized peripheral blood ex vivo with a cocktail of small molecules prior to allo-HCT. An established xenogeneic mouse model was used to examine the potential of this cell programming strategy to reduce rates of GvHD. Sublethally irradiated NOD-scid IL2rÎ³null (NSG) mice were transplanted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) pulse treated ex vivo with either vehicle or a cocktail of two small molecules (FT1050+FT4145). Recipients of pharmacologically programmed PBMCs had significantly lower GvHD scores, decreased levels of circulating IFN-É£ and enhanced survival relative to recipients of vehicle PBMCs (p<0.0001, Mantel-Cox log rank). In addition to xenograft-GvHD studies, we explored the impact of this cell programming strategy in a murine model of GvL. Lethally irradiated BALB/c (H-2Kd) recipient mice were transplanted with either control or FT1050+FT4145 programmed C57BL/6 (H-2Kb) CD8+ T cells and T celldepleted bone marrow. Prior to allo-HCT, recipients were injected with 2x104 luciferase-expressing A20 lymphoma cells (A20-luc). Bioluminescence imaging was used to monitor the tumor burden over a 28 day period post-HCT. Donor cells programmed with this small molecule cocktail significantly improved survival (p<0.001) while retaining GvL effects against the A20 lymphoma cells. Combined, these studies demonstrate that pharmacologic programming of hematopoietic cells with FT1050+FT4145 prior to allo-HCT may offer an innovative therapeutic approach to reduce rates of GvHD without compromising GvL activity.

A LASSO-Inspired Approach for Localizing Power System Infeasibility,"A method is proposed to identify and localize the cause of network collapse with augmented power flow analysis for a grid model with insufficient resources. Owing to heavy network loading, insufficient generation, component failures and unavoidable disturbances, power grid models can sometimes fail to converge to a feasible solution for a steady-state power flow study. For applications such as system expansion planning, it is desirable to locate the system buses that are contributing to network infeasibilities to facilitate corrective actions. This paper proposes a novel LASSO-inspired regularization of the power flow matrix that enforces sparsity to localize and quantify infeasibilities in the network. One of the examples demonstrates how the proposed method is capable of localizing a source of blackout to a single dominant bus on an 80k+ bus eastern interconnection model.",2019,ArXiv
The Spike-and-Slab Lasso regression modeling with compositional covariates: An application on Brazilian children malnutrition data.,"There are considerable challenges in analyzing large-scale compositional data. In this paper, we introduce the Spike-and-Slab Lasso linear regression in the presence of compositional covariates for parameter estimation and variable selection. We consider the well-known isometric log-ratio (ilr) coordinates to avoid misleading statistical inference. The separable and non-separable (adaptative) Spike-and-Slab Lasso penalties are compared to verify the advantages of each approach. The proposed method is illustrated on simulated and on real Brazilian child malnutrition data.",2019,Statistical methods in medical research
Estimating Time-Varying Graphical Models,"In this paper, we study time-varying graphical models based on data measured over a temporal grid. Such models are motivated by the needs to describe and understand evolving interacting relationships among a set of random variables in many real applications, for instance the study of how stocks interact with each other and how such interactions change over time. 
We propose a new model, LOcal Group Graphical Lasso Estimation (loggle), under the assumption that the graph topology changes gradually over time. Specifically, loggle uses a novel local group-lasso type penalty to efficiently incorporate information from neighboring time points and to impose structural smoothness of the graphs. We implement an ADMM based algorithm to fit the loggle model. This algorithm utilizes blockwise fast computation and pseudo-likelihood approximation to improve computational efficiency. An R package loggle has also been developed. 
We evaluate the performance of loggle by simulation experiments. We also apply loggle to S&P 500 stock price data and demonstrate that loggle is able to reveal the interacting relationships among stocks and among industrial sectors in a time period that covers the recent global financial crisis.",2018,ArXiv
"Cheirolepidiaceous diversity: An anatomically preserved pollen cone from the Lower Jurassic of southern Victoria Land, Antarctica","Abstract To date, the vast majority of fossils described for the extinct conifer family, the Cheirolepidiaceae, have been reported from compression/impressions primarily from Cretaceous rocks; there are fewer reports from permineralizations and the Jurassic. New specimens have recently been discovered in siliceous blocks composed of fusainized layers of plant remains that alternate with fine-grained sediments from the Carapace Nunatak (Lower Jurassic) locality of southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. Specimens were prepared using standard serial cellulose-acetate peel technique, transmitted-light microscopy, and SEM analysis. The cones are ellipsoidal, up to 5.5Â mm long, and consist of helically arranged microsporophylls, each with a slender stalk containing a single vascular bundle; the distal lamina is peltate and most closely resembles those of the Classostrobus . Four to seven pollen sacs are arranged in an annular cluster abaxial to the sporophyll stalk. In situ Classopollis pollen ranges from 18 to 60Â Î¼m in equatorial diameter with an average diameter of 30Â Î¼m. In addition to these well-preserved pollen cones there is a large diversity of vegetative conifer remains within the Carapace Nunatak material including leaf and stem fragments. The discovery of the pollen cones in combination with vegetative remains provides additional information on the reproductive biology of the Cheirolepidiaceae and increases the probability of developing a whole-plant concept for this Jurassic permineralized conifer.",2015,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology
Supplement to â€œ A Generalized Least Squares Matrix Decomposition â€,"In addition to sparseness, there is much interest in penalties that encourage smoothness, especially in the context of functional data analysis. We show how the GPMF can be used with smooth penalties and propose a generalized gradient descent method to solve for these smooth GPMF factors. Many have proposed to obtain smoothness in the factors by using a quadratic penalty. Rice and Silverman (1991) suggested P (v) = v Î©v, where Î© is the matrix of squared second or fourth differences. As this penalty is not homogeneous of order one, we use the Î©norm penalty: P (v) = (v Î©v)âˆ’1/2 = ||v ||Î©. Since this penalty is a norm or a semi-norm, the GPMF solution given in Theorem 2 can be employed. We seek to minimize the following Î©-norm penalized regression problem: 1 2 ||X Quâˆ’v ||R + Î»v ||v ||Î©. Notice that this problem is similar in structure to the group lasso problem of Yuan and Lin (2006) with one group. To solve the Î©-norm penalized regression problem, we use a generalized gradient descent method. (We note that there are more elaborate first order solvers, introduced in recent works such as Becker et al. (2010, 2009), and we describe a simple version of such solvers). Suppose",2013,
Value of serum procalcitonin in clinical diagnosis of hospital-associated bacterial infections,"OBJECTIVE To explore the value of serum procalcitonin(PCT)level in clinical diagnosis of hospital-associated bacterial infections so as to offer the laboratory examination method for clinical diagnosis of the hospitalassociated bacterial infections.METHODS A total of 427 patients with hospital-associated infections who were hospitalized from May 2013 to Apr 2014 were enrolled in the study;291patients with non-severe infections were assigned as the group A,and 136 patients with severe infections were set as the group B,meanwhile,277 hospitalized patients without hospital-associated infections were chosen as the control group.The PCT level was determined by means of semi-quantitative immuno-chromatographic method,the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein(hsCRP)level was measured by using high-sensitivity immunoturbidimetric assay,and the white blood cell(WBC)counts were measured with the use of hematology analyzer.RESULTS The proportion of the patients with the PCT level more than 10.0Î¼g/L was 14.09%in the group A,significantly lower than 67.65%in the group B,but significantly higher than 0in the control group;the positive rate of PCT of the group A was 36.00%,significantly lower than 89.71% of the group B,but significantly higher than 7.49% of the control group,and there was significant between- group difference(P0.05).The levels of hs-CRP and WBC of the group A and group B were significantly higher than those of the control group(P0.05),and there was no statistically significant difference between the group A and the group B.CONCLUSIONThe laboratory detection of the PCT level is conducive to the preliminary determination of the hospital-associated bacterial infections and the severity of the infections so as to provide guidance for early treatment and prediction of prognosis.",2015,Chinese Journal of Nosocomiology
Identification of Urinary Polyphenol Metabolite Patterns Associated with Polyphenol-Rich Food Intake in Adults from Four European Countries,"We identified urinary polyphenol metabolite patterns by a novel algorithm that combines dimension reduction and variable selection methods to explain polyphenol-rich food intake, and compared their respective performance with that of single biomarkers in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. The study included 475 adults from four European countries (Germany, France, Italy, and Greece). Dietary intakes were assessed with 24-h dietary recalls (24-HDR) and dietary questionnaires (DQ). Thirty-four polyphenols were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS-MS) in 24-h urine. Reduced rank regression-based variable importance in projection (RRR-VIP) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods were used to select polyphenol metabolites. Reduced rank regression (RRR) was then used to identify patterns in these metabolites, maximizing the explained variability in intake of pre-selected polyphenol-rich foods. The performance of RRR models was evaluated using internal cross-validation to control for over-optimistic findings from over-fitting. High performance was observed for explaining recent intake (24-HDR) of red wine (r = 0.65; AUC = 89.1%), coffee (r = 0.51; AUC = 89.1%), and olives (r = 0.35; AUC = 82.2%). These metabolite patterns performed better or equally well compared to single polyphenol biomarkers. Neither metabolite patterns nor single biomarkers performed well in explaining habitual intake (as reported in the DQ) of polyphenol-rich foods. This proposed strategy of biomarker pattern identification has the potential of expanding the currently still limited list of available dietary intake biomarkers.",2017,Nutrients
Variable Selection via Basis Pursuit for Non-Gaussian Data,"A simultaneous flexible variable selection procedure is proposed by applying a basis pursuit method to the likelihood function. The basis functions are chosen to be compatible with variable selection in the context of smoothing spline ANOVA models. Since it is a generalized LASSO-type method, it enjoys the favorable property of shrinking coefficients and gives interpretable results. We derive a Generalized Approximate Cross Validation function (GACV), an approximate leave-out-one cross validation function used to choose smoothing parameters. In order to apply the GACV function for a large data set situation, we propose a corresponding randomized GACV. A technique called â€˜slice modelingâ€™ is used to develop an efficient code. Our simulation study shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the Bernoulli case.",2001,
Robust machine learning by median-of-means : theory and practice,"We introduce new estimators for robust machine learning based on median-of-means (MOM) estimators of the mean of real valued random variables. These estimators achieve optimal rates of convergence under minimal assumptions on the dataset. The dataset may also have been corrupted by outliers on which no assumption is granted. We also analyze these new estimators with standard tools from robust statistics. In particular, we revisit the concept of breakdown point. We modify the original definition by studying the number of outliers that a dataset can contain without deteriorating the estimation properties of a given estimator. This new notion of breakdown number, that takes into account the statistical performances of the estimators, is non-asymptotic in nature and adapted for machine learning purposes. We proved that the breakdown number of our estimator is of the order of (number of observations)*(rate of convergence). For instance, the breakdown number of our estimators for the problem of estimation of a d-dimensional vector with a noise variance sigma^2 is sigma^2d and it becomes sigma^2 s log(d/s) when this vector has only s non-zero component. Beyond this breakdown point, we proved that the rate of convergence achieved by our estimator is (number of outliers) divided by (number of observation). 
Besides these theoretical guarantees, the major improvement brought by these new estimators is that they are easily computable in practice. In fact, basically any algorithm used to approximate the standard Empirical Risk Minimizer (or its regularized versions) has a robust version approximating our estimators. As a proof of concept, we study many algorithms for the classical LASSO estimator. A byproduct of the MOM algorithms is a measure of depth of data that can be used to detect outliers.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory
A Dynamic Network Perspective on Cryptocurrencies,"Cryptocurrencies are becoming an attractive asset class and are the focus of recent quantitative research. The joint dynamics of the cryptocurrency market yields information on network risk. Utilizing the adaptive LASSO approach, we build a dynamic network of cryptocurrencies and model the latent communities with a dynamic stochastic blockmodel. We develop a dynamic covariate-assisted spectral clustering method to uniformly estimate the latent group membership of cryptocurrencies consistently. We show that return inter-predictability and crypto characteristics, including hashing algorithms and proof types, jointly determine the crypto market segmentation. Based on this classiï¬cation result, it is natural to employ eigenvector centrality to identify a cryptocurrencyâ€™s idiosyncratic risk. An asset pricing analysis ï¬nds that a cross-sectional portfolio with a higher centrality earns a higher risk premium. Further tests conï¬rm that centrality serves as a risk factor well and delivers valuable information content on cryptocurrency markets.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Iterative sure independence screening EM-Bayesian LASSO algorithm for multi-locus genome-wide association studies,"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) entails examining a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a limited sample with hundreds of individuals, implying a variable selection problem in the high dimensional dataset. Although many single-locus GWAS approaches under polygenic background and population structure controls have been widely used, some significant loci fail to be detected. In this study, we used an iterative modified-sure independence screening (ISIS) approach in reducing the number of SNPs to a moderate size. Expectation-Maximization (EM)-Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (BLASSO) was used to estimate all the selected SNP effects for true quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) detection. This method is referred to as ISIS EM-BLASSO algorithm. Monte Carlo simulation studies validated the new method, which has the highest empirical power in QTN detection and the highest accuracy in QTN effect estimation, and it is the fastest, as compared with efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU), and multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model (mrMLM). To further demonstrate the new method, six flowering time traits in Arabidopsis thaliana were re-analyzed by four methods (New method, EMMA, FarmCPU, and mrMLM). As a result, the new method identified most previously reported genes. Therefore, the new method is a good alternative for multi-locus GWAS.",2017,PLoS Computational Biology
The Impact of Different Genetic Architectures on Accuracy of Genomic Selection Using Three Bayesian Methods,"Genome-wide evaluation uses the associations of a large number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers across the whole genome and then combines the statistical methods with genomic data to predict the genetic values. Genomic predictions relieson linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genetic markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) in a population. Methods that use all markers simultaneously may therefore result in greater reliabilities of predictions of the total genetic merit, indicating that a larger proportion of the genetic variance is explained. This is hypothesized that the genome-wide methods deal differently with genetic architecture of quantitative traits and genome. The genomic nonlinear Bayesian variable selection methods (BayesA, BayesBand Bayesian LASSO) are compared using the stochastic simulation across three effective population sizes (Ne). Thereby, a genome with three chromosomes, 100 cM each was simulated. For each animal, a trait was simulated with heritability of 0.50, three different marker densities (1000, 2000 and 3000 markers) and number of the QTL was assumed to be either 100, 200 or 300. The data were simulated with two different QTL distributionswhich were uniform and gamma (Î±=1.66, Î²=0.4). Marker density, number of the QTL and the QTL effect distributions affected the genomic estimated breeding value accuracy with different Ne (P<0.05). In comparison of three methods, the greatest genomic accuracy obtained by BayesB method for traits influenced by a low number of the QTL, high marker density, gamma QTL distribution and high Ne.",2018,Iranian Journal of Applied Animal Science
Closing the Circle: Yellow Ribbons and the Redemption of the Past,"In the explosion of public patriotism that accompanied the 1991 Gulf War, the most visible symbol of troop support was not the Stars and Stripes--although flags were profusely evident--but a recently invented tradition, the yellow ribbon. The practice of tying these mini-banners around trees had first surfaced during the 1979-81 hostage crisis as a sign of sympathy for embassy victims of the Iranian revolution. Its resuscitation ten years later, as nearly half a million troops flew to the Middle East, symbolically linked U.S. civilian and military personnel not only to each other, but to a home front that viewed their endeavors with pride and foreboding.Ribbon display during the Iran crisis can be traced to a Maryland woman, Penne Laingen, whose husband Bruce had been charge d'affaires at the Teheran embassy and who, after its capture, edited a newsletter for hostage families. In a 1973 pop song, ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree,"" a beribboned tree had symbolized a woman's fidelity to her imprisoned husband, and Laingen promoted the idea in numerous speeches and newsletter columns. Ribbons quickly sprouted around the country, and the song itself acquired a patriotic sheen. As commiserative emblems, the ribbons amply illustrated Hobsbawm and Ranger's (1988) observation that traditions are invented, in many instances, as salves for crisis.But if it was the hostage crisis that sparked the instant tradition, it took a more elaborate and desperate crisis--the war against Saddam Hussein--to develop its potential. Even before the first bombs began to drop on Baghdad in January of 1991, yellow ribbons were being touted as symbols of national resolve, and the country was awash in a virtual ""blizzard of satin and acetate"" (Collins 28). Lassoed trees weren't the half of it. Homeowners hung ribbons on fences, flagpoles and doors, often in concert with seasonal emblems to create what Jack Santino (1992) has called ""folk assemblages."" The business community, which had rallied to a national cause in the 1930s by displaying blue eagles, now featured yellow bows in their windows and advertisements. Supermarkets decorated their coupon inserts with the supportive emblems and switched to yellow register tapes for the duration of the war. Newspapers and magazines ran the ribbons up their mastheads. Local governments sprinkled them throughout municipal buildings and public spaces. Churches expressed their sympathy with Desert Storm troops, if not with their mission, by adding satin bows to seasonal wreaths under the sign of the cross. Florists incorporated yellow ribbons into their arrangements. Novelty companies produced yellow ribbon bumper stickers, decals, buttons, pins, gimme hats, tee shirts and coffee mugs. One need not be cynically Marxist to observe that, on the home front, the six-week war was a small-business bonanza (Ballen 14).Nor did the yellowing of America come to a halt with the February ceasefire. As Desert Storm troops began to trickle home, the ribbons continued to advertise national solidarity. The tenor of bumper sticker philosophy moved from ""Kick ass"" to ""Welcome home,"" but the yellow symbols remained as prominent as ever. An ""Archie"" comic book featuring the story ""When Johnny and Jenny Come Marching Home Again"" was littered equally with yellow bows and traditional bunting. The United States Postal Service issued a stamp honoring ""those who served,"" with a slender ribbon snaking decoratively through its ads. Troops disembarking at Air Force bases were ""decorated"" with citizens' versions of the campaign ribbon (Brosnan 12). In Austin, Texas, a July 4 salute to Texas troops--sponsored by mogul Ross Perot and billed modestly as ""the biggest celebration in history""--included a project that would have turned artist Christo green: A San Antonio engineer wrapped the Capitol building in yellow metal as part of a Texas-sized ""Operation Yellow Ribbon."" Twelve months after Saddam Hussein cried uncle, a million ribbons still fluttered in the breeze of a ""reborn"" America. â€¦",1994,The Journal of American Culture

Assessment of Sparse Regression Machine Learning Methods for Genome-Wide Association Studies,"The data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans are still predominantly analyzed using single marker association methods. As an alternative to Single Marker Analysis (SMA), all or subsets of markers can be tested simultaneously. This approach requires a form of Penalized Regression (PR) as the number of SNPs is much larger than the sample size. Here we review PR methods in the context of GWAS, extend them to perform penalty parameter and SNP selection by False Discovery Rate (FDR) control, and assess their performance (including penalties incorporating linkage disequilibrium) in comparison with SMA. PR methods were compared with SMA on realistically simulated GWAS data consisting of genotype data from single and multiple chromosomes and a continuous phenotype and on real data. Based on our comparisons our analytic FDR criterion may currently be the best approach to SNP selection using PR for GWAS. We found that PR with FDR control provides substantially more power than SMA with genome-wide type-I error control but somewhat less power than SMA with BenjaminiHochberg FDR control. PR controlled the FDR conservatively while SMA-BH may not achieve FDR control in all situations. Differences among PR methods seem quite small when the focus is on variable selection with FDR control. Incorporating LD into PR by adapting penalties developed for covariates measured on graphs can improve power but also generate morel false positives or wider regions for follow-up. We recommend using the Elastic Net with a mixing weight for the Lasso penalty near 0.5 as the best method.",2014,

"Vadicella arenosi gen. nov., sp. nov., a Novel Member of the Class Alphaproteobacteria Isolated from Sandy Sediments from the Sea of Japan Seashore","A taxonomic study of three aerobic, Gram-negative, non-pigmented, non-motile rod-shaped bacterial strains, designated KMM 9008, KMM 9017, and KMM 9024T, which were isolated from a sandy sediment sample collected from the Sea of Japan seashore, was undertaken. The DNAâ€“DNA hybridization values of 88â€“96% obtained between novel strains confirm their assignment to the same species. An analysis of the nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the novel isolates were closely related to each other (99.6â€“100% sequence similarity) and shared highest sequence similarities to the described genera Celeribacter (96.2â€“95.9%), Pseudoruegeria (95.6â€“94.3%), and Thalassobacter (95.2â€“93.1%) within the class Alphaproteobacteria. The major isoprenoid quinone was Q-10, polar lipids were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, an unknown aminolipid and an unknown lipid as prevalent, and phosphatidylethanolamine was a minor component, and major fatty acids were C18:1Ï‰7c, followed by 11-Methyl C18:1Ï‰7c, C12:1 and C10:0 3-OH in all strains. The DNA G+C content of strains KMM 9008, KMM 9017, and KMM 9024T was in the range of 56.7â€“60Â mol%. Based on distinctive phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic distance, strain KMM 9024T (=NRIC 0787T = JCM 17190T) represents the type strain of a novel species in a novel genus, for which the name Vadicella arenosi gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.",2010,Current Microbiology
CPGL: A classification method combining PCA and the Group Lasso method,"Sparse representation based optimization has emerged as a new paradigm for solving classification problems and has achieved satisfactory performances. Recent research, however, has revealed its noteworthy limitation in handling samples with high intra-class pair-wise correlations. In this paper, we study this problem from a novel perspective of de-correlating the input data. A new method is proposed by combining Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and the Group Lasso method. The highly correlated training samples are first orthogonalized using PCA, and then the Group Lasso algorithm is adopted for performing the classification. Experimental results show that our proposed method over-performs the Group Lasso method in the face recognition application on two public databases.",2010,2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing
The CapitÃ£es Mores of the Japan Voyage: A Group Portrait,"Starting from the premise that all empire building involves ideological constructs justifying the violence that accompanies such efforts, this article concentrates on elucidating the case of the Portuguese in Asia, specifically in Japan. Although well beyond the formal Portuguese thalassocracy in Asia, the Japanese islands were exposed for about a century, between 1543 and 1640, to the informal presence of Portuguese traders and missionaries. The symbiotic relationship between these two groups was based on the experience that, in Japan, the trade was difficult to conduct, for violence was always lurking beneath the surface of the trading relationship. We know of several instances when such violence actually exploded into major armed clashes, and many other times violence was narrowly averted through the mediation of the missionaries. Based on original research in the archives of Portugal and Spain, this article analyzes the records that the leaders of the Portuguese who came to Japan in the sixteenth century, the so-called capitaes mores, have left behind. Finding that a significant number of these men were or later became members of the Order of Christ or were closely related to such members, it then explores their mindset through a survey of the function of this military order in Portuguese society of the late Middle Ages. The result is a group portrait of thirty-seven men who may be considered a representative sample of the Portuguese leading both the formal and informal empires in Asia. This portrait will clarify why both Japanese and Portuguese authorities agreed, at least during the second half of the sixteenth century, that the Jesuit missionaries were an indispensable presence in Japan.",2012,International Journal of Asian Studies
Contingency without Unreason,"Abstract In this essay I critique the identification of contingency with sheer arbitrary possibility in Quentin Meillassoux's After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency. After offering logical and metaphysical reasons for why such an identification is a limitation on the speculative potential of reason, I draw upon Charles S. Peirce, Gilles Deleuze, and Giambattista Vico to articulate the outlines of a view of contingency which can underwrite a different speculative position to one that is grounded upon an absolute of unreason. This form of speculation, a realism of contingency without an axiom of unreason, is indicated in outline by the structure of divination practices. I thus propose, without defending its actuality, at least the possibility of a divinatory form of speculation that is adequate to the absolute status of contingency.",2014,Angelaki
A fish-feeding laboratory bioassay to assess the antipredatory activity of secondary metabolites from the tissues of marine organisms.,"Marine chemical ecology is a young discipline, having emerged from the collaboration of natural products chemists and marine ecologists in the 1980s with the goal of examining the ecological functions of secondary metabolites from the tissues of marine organisms. The result has been a progression of protocols that have increasingly refined the ecological relevance of the experimental approach. Here we present the most up-to-date version of a fish-feeding laboratory bioassay that enables investigators to assess the antipredatory activity of secondary metabolites from the tissues of marine organisms. Organic metabolites of all polarities are exhaustively extracted from the tissue of the target organism and reconstituted at natural concentrations in a nutritionally appropriate food matrix. Experimental food pellets are presented to a generalist predator in laboratory feeding assays to assess the antipredatory activity of the extract. The procedure described herein uses the bluehead, Thalassoma bifasciatum, to test the palatability of Caribbean marine invertebrates; however, the design may be readily adapted to other systems. Results obtained using this laboratory assay are an important prelude to field experiments that rely on the feeding responses of a full complement of potential predators. Additionally, this bioassay can be used to direct the isolation of feeding-deterrent metabolites through bioassay-guided fractionation. This feeding bioassay has advanced our understanding of the factors that control the distribution and abundance of marine invertebrates on Caribbean coral reefs and may inform investigations in diverse fields of inquiry, including pharmacology, biotechnology, and evolutionary ecology.",2015,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE
Parallel Tempering with Lasso for Model Reduction in Systems Biology,"Systems Biology models reveal relationships between signaling inputs and observable molecular or cellular behaviors. The complexity of these models, however, often obscures key elements that regulate emergent properties. We use a Bayesian model reduction approach that combines Parallel Tempering with Lasso regularization to identify minimal subsets of reactions in a signaling network that are sufficient to reproduce experimentally observed data. The Bayesian approach finds distinct reduced models that fit data equivalently. A variant of this approach based on Group Lasso is applied to the NF-ÎºB signaling network to test the necessity of feedback loops for responses to pulsatile and continuous pathway stimulation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Bayesian parameter estimation combined with regularization can isolate and reveal core motifs sufficient to explain data from complex signaling systems.",2019,bioRxiv
Does Californiaâ€™s Low Carbon Fuel Standards reduce carbon dioxide emissions?,"The Low Carbon Fuel Standards (LCFS) represents a new policy approach designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by applying standards to all stages of motor fuel production. We use the synthetic control and difference-in-differences econometric methods, and Lasso machine learning to analyze the effect of the LCFS on emissions in California's transportation sector. The three different techniques provide robust evidence that the LCFS reduced carbon dioxide emissions in California's transportation sector by around 10%. Furthermore, our calculations show that improved air quality, due to the application of the LCFS, may have benefited California in the magnitude of hundreds of millions of dollars through an increase in worker's productivity.",2018,PLoS ONE
Adaptive Loop Transfer Recovery,"DAPTIVE control is an attractive approach in nonlinear systems theory due to its ability to cope with system uncertainties and failures. Adaptive controllers can be classified as either indirect or direct. This paper focuses on improving the robustness of a direct adaptive control design. The method is arrived at by examining the loop transfer properties of an adaptive system when linearized about an equilibrium condition. The design approach modifiesanadaptivelawwiththegoalofpreservingthelooptransfer propertiesofareferencemodelassociatedwithanonadaptivecontrol design. The aim is to achieve an adaptive system that preserves the stability margins of a nonadaptive design, while at the same time providing the benefits of adaptation to modeling error. Many modification terms are reported in the literature [1â€“11]. Included among these, ï¿½ modification [1] adds a pure damping term to the adaptive law, whereas e modification [2] adds a variable damping term that depends on the error signal. These terms are introduced to ensure that the adapted weights remain bounded. Backgroundlearning[3â€“5]usescurrentandpastdataconcurrentlyin the adaptation process.

Supplement to Modeling and Forecasting Large Realized Covariance Matrices and Portfolio Choice,"We consider modeling and forecasting large realized covariance matrices by penalized vector autoregressive models. We consider Lasso-type estimators to reduce the dimensionality and provide strong theoretical guarantees on the forecast capability of our procedure. We show that we can forecast realized covariance matrices almost as precisely as if we had known the true driving dynamics of these in advance. We next investigate the sources of these driving dynamics as well as the performance of the proposed models for forecasting the realized covariance matrices of the 30 Dow Jones stocks. We find that the dynamics are not stable as the data are aggregated from the daily to lower frequencies. Furthermore, we are able beat our benchmark by a wide margin. Finally, we investigate the economic value of our forecasts in a portfolio selection exercise and find that in certain cases an investor is willing to pay a considerable amount in order get access to our forecasts. This supplement contains additional empirical results as well as the proofs for all theoretical results in the paper.",2015,
Anterior approach for operative fixation of coronoid fractures in complex elbow instability.,"The coronoid process has been shown to play a critical role in ulnohumeral stability. Coronoid process fractures can occur in isolation or as part of a complex injury pattern. The most common complex pattern, known as the ""terrible triad,"" includes a radial head fracture and elbow dislocation along with the coronoid fracture. Failure to address these fractures and ligamentous injuries can result in recurrent instability and progression to painful arthrosis. Both medial and lateral approaches to the coronoid have been popularized in recent literature, but there is no universally accepted approach. Common fixation techniques include suture lasso, suture anchors, lag screws, and plating all of which have various drawbacks. We describe a direct anterior approach to address coronoid process fractures made in addition to a lateral approach to address radial head and lateral collateral ligament injuries. Coronoid fractures addressed through the anterior approach were stabilized with anterior to posterior screw fixation combined with buttress plating, which allowed anatomic reduction and stable internal fixation at short-term follow-up.",2012,Techniques in hand & upper extremity surgery
Development and Performance Analysis of a Simulation-Optimization Framework on TeraGrid Linux Clusters,"A Large Scale Simulation Optimization (LASSO) framework is being developed by the authors. Linux clusters are the target platform for the framework, specifically cluster resources on the NSF TeraGrid. The framework is designed in a modular fashion that simplifies coupling with simulation model executables, allowing application of simulation optimization approaches across problem domains. In this paper the LASSO framework is coupled with a parallel groundwater transport simulation model. The performance of the LASSO framework is measured using a source history reconstruction problem and benchmarked against an existing MPI based implementation developed previously. Performance results indicate that communication overhead in the LASSO framework is contributing significantly to wall times. The authors purpose and will conduct several performance optimizations designed to ameliorate the problem.",2005,
On arginase and its participation in urea synthesis in the liver.,"Since Bollman, Mann & Magath (1924) demonstrated that in vivo mammalian liver was the only site for the synthesis of urea, much effort has been directed to the investigation of the details of this synthesizing mechanism. The theory of the 'ornithine cycle' (Krebs &; Henseleit, 1932) offered a plausible explanation, until Neber (1935), London & Alexandry (1937) and Leuthardt (1938), in similar experiments in vivo and in vitro, were unable to confirm the essential role attributed to ornithine in urea synthesis. Trowell more recently (1942), in perfusion experiments, failed to find more than a transitory effect on urea synthesis by the other members of the 'ornithine cycle', citrulline and arginine; he found, however, a catalytic action of ornithine under his experimental conditions. The experiments of Schoenheimer, Ratner & Rittenberg (1939) confirming the 'cycle' are not unambiguous. The workers after feeding with Nl"" found a high percentage of the isotope both in the urea and in the protein-linked arginine but not in the free arginine. They formulated the hypothesis that 'free arginine' and protein arginine are continuously exchanged in the liver, and that urea is formed from arginine while the latter is in the free state, for peptide-linked arginine is not hydrolyzed by arginase. Furthermore, the amide-N fraction ofthe liver protein of the carcass contained only slightly less N""6 than the amidine fraction of the arginine, a finding which supports the idea that amide-N may possibly play a part as important as that of arginine in the synthetic mechanism (Leuthardt, 1938; Bach, 1939). Bach (1939) suggested a new mechanism of urea synthesis in which glutamine was the principal ammonia carrier in place of ornithine and citrulline ('amide-N cycle') and explained the effect of citrulline on urea synthesis by its oxidation by keto-acids to glutamic acid and glutamine. He suggested a similar possibility for ornithine. Arginine and arginase were not considered to participate in this mechanism. The abundant occurrence of arginase in mammalian liver, however, and the ease with which it can be demonstrated, may have influenced the general opinion for a long time in favour of arginine being the only source of urea. Clementi's empirical rule (Clementi, 1914) that arginase is present in the livers of ureatelic and absent from those of uricotelic aninals, although it cannot be applied without limitations, has contributed much to this view. Leuthardt & Glasson (1942) attempted to reconcile the importance attributed by Leuthardt (1938) and Bach (1939) to glutamine with the essential role earlier given to arginine and arginase in urea synthesis. They suggested, though without much experimental evidence, an extension of the 'ornithine cycle' to include glutamine, which acts as ammonia carrier and transfers its ammonia to ornithine, whence the cycle continues to arginine and urea. In view of these conflicting views on the problem of urea synthesis and the part played by arginine and arginase, an attempt was made to decide if urea synthesis could take place in the liver without the participation of arginase. Experiments to this effect were described by Bach & Williamson (1942) who showed that urea synthesis was not impeded when arginase was inhibited by excess ornithine. Details of this preliminary work are given in this paper, which also includes experiments on the nature of 'soluble' and 'tissue' arginase. Arginase is a highly soluble enzyme and will in experiments in vitro partially diffuse out of the tissue into the surrounding medium. Any effect observed with arginase might therefore be interpreted as originating from the extracellular part of the enzyme, the portion within the intact tissue not having come into play (Krebs, 1943). The participation of this 'tissue arginase' in the experiments, the similarity of 'tissue' and 'extracellular' arginase with respect to their Michaelis constant, to the effect of 03 on the enzymes, and to the inhibition by ornithine, are shown in the first part of this paper, together with experiments on the accessibility of the tissue to arginine and ornithine. The remaining experiments are desvoted to the main problem of the participation of arginase in urea synthesis.",1944,The Biochemical journal

An Interior-Point Method for Large-Scale  $\ell_1$-Regularized Least Squares,"Recently, a lot of attention has been paid to regularization based methods for sparse signal reconstruction (e.g., basis pursuit denoising and compressed sensing) and feature selection (e.g., the Lasso algorithm) in signal processing, statistics, and related fields. These problems can be cast as -regularized least-squares programs (LSPs), which can be reformulated as convex quadratic programs, and then solved by several standard methods such as interior-point methods, at least for small and medium size problems. In this paper, we describe a specialized interior-point method for solving large-scale -regularized LSPs that uses the preconditioned conjugate gradients algorithm to compute the search direction. The interior-point method can solve large sparse problems, with a million variables and observations, in a few tens of minutes on a PC. It can efficiently solve large dense problems, that arise in sparse signal recovery with orthogonal transforms, by exploiting fast algorithms for these transforms. The method is illustrated on a magnetic resonance imaging data set.",2007,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing
A Comparative Study of the Lasso-Type and Heuristic Model Selection Methods,"This study presents a first comparative analysis of Lasso-type (Lasso, adaptive Lasso, elastic net) and heuristic subset selection methods. Although the Lasso has shown success in many situations, it has some limitations. In particular, inconsistent results are obtained for pairwise strongly correlated predictors. An alternative to the Lasso is constituted by model selection based on information criteria (IC), which remains consistent in the situation mentioned. However, these criteria are hard to optimize due to a discrete search space. To overcome this problem, an optimization heuristic (Genetic Algorithm) is applied. Monte-Carlo simulation results are reported to illustrate the performance of the methods.",2013,Journal of Economics and Statistics
Piecewise Linear Regularized Solution Paths,"We consider the generic regularized optimization problem Î²(Î») = argminÎ² L(y, XÎ²) + Î»J(Î²). Efron, Hastie, Johnstone and Tibshirani [Ann. Statist. 32 (2004) 407-499] have shown that for the LASSO-that is, if L is squared error loss and J(Î²) = âˆ¥Î²âˆ¥ 1 is the l 1 norm of Î²-the optimal coefficient path is piecewise linear, that is, âˆ‚Î²(Î»)/âˆ‚Î». is piecewise constant. We derive a general characterization of the properties of (loss L, penalty J) pairs which give piecewise linear coefficient paths. Such pairs allow for efficient generation of the full regularized coefficient paths. We investigate the nature of efficient path following algorithms which arise. We use our results to suggest robust versions of the LASSO for regression and classification, and to develop new, efficient algorithms for existing problems in the literature, including Mammen and van de Geer's locally adaptive regression splines.",2007,Annals of Statistics
[18F] FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Tumor and Penumbra Imaging Features Predict Recurrence in Nonâ€“Small Cell Lung Cancer,"We identified computational imaging features on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) that predict recurrence/progression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We retrospectively identified 291 patients with NSCLC from 2 prospectively acquired cohorts (training, n = 145; validation, n = 146). We contoured the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) on all pretreatment PET images and added a 3-dimensional penumbra region that extended outward 1 cm from the tumor surface. We generated 512 radiomics features, selected 435 features based on robustness to contour variations, and then applied randomized sparse regression (LASSO) to identify features that predicted time to recurrence in the training cohort. We built Cox proportional hazards models in the training cohort and independently evaluated the models in the validation cohort. Two features including stage and a MTV plus penumbra texture feature were selected by LASSO. Both features were significant univariate predictors, with stage being the best predictor (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56-2.95], P < .001). However, adding the MTV plus penumbra texture feature to stage significantly improved prediction (P = .006). This multivariate model was a significant predictor of time to recurrence in the training cohort (concordance = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.66-0.81], P < .001) that was validated in a separate validation cohort (concordance = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.67-0.81], P < .001). A combined radiomics and clinical model improved NSCLC recurrence prediction. FDG PET radiomic features may be useful biomarkers for lung cancer prognosis and add clinical utility for risk stratification.",2019,Tomography
Homogeneity Pursuit,"This article explores the homogeneity of coefficients in high-dimensional regression, which extends the sparsity concept and is more general and suitable for many applications. Homogeneity arises when regression coefficients corresponding to neighboring geographical regions or a similar cluster of covariates are expected to be approximately the same. Sparsity corresponds to a special case of homogeneity with a large cluster of known atom zero. In this article, we propose a new method called clustering algorithm in regression via data-driven segmentation (CARDS) to explore homogeneity. New mathematics are provided on the gain that can be achieved by exploring homogeneity. Statistical properties of two versions of CARDS are analyzed. In particular, the asymptotic normality of our proposed CARDS estimator is established, which reveals better estimation accuracy for homogeneous parameters than that without homogeneity exploration. When our methods are combined with sparsity exploration, further efficiency can be achieved beyond the exploration of sparsity alone. This provides additional insights into the power of exploring low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional regression: homogeneity and sparsity. Our results also shed lights on the properties of the fused Lasso. The newly developed method is further illustrated by simulation studies and applications to real data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",2015,Journal of the American Statistical Association
A Two-Stage Mutual Information Based Bayesian Lasso Algorithm for Multi-Locus Genome-Wide Association Studies,"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has turned out to be an essential technology for exploring the genetic mechanism of complex traits. To reduce the complexity of computation, it is well accepted to remove unrelated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) before GWAS, e.g., by using iterative sure independence screening expectation-maximization Bayesian Lasso (ISIS EM-BLASSO) method. In this work, a modified version of ISIS EM-BLASSO is proposed, which reduces the number of SNPs by a screening methodology based on Pearson correlation and mutual information, then estimates the effects via EM-Bayesian Lasso (EM-BLASSO), and finally detects the true quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) through likelihood ratio test. We call our method a two-stage mutual information based Bayesian Lasso (MBLASSO). Under three simulation scenarios, MBLASSO improves the statistical power and retains the higher effect estimation accuracy when comparing with three other algorithms. Moreover, MBLASSO performs best on model fitting, the accuracy of detected associations is the highest, and 21 genes can only be detected by MBLASSO in Arabidopsis thaliana datasets.",2020,Entropy
Biomass of Birds and Mammals in the Ross Sea,"The distribution and biomass of birds and mammals were determined for the Ross Sea, Antarctica. A total of 548 30-min strip (4â€“10 km long) censuses were made during 5 cruises south of 65Â°S between 15 December and 18 January in 1976â€“1980. Within the boundaries of the Ross Sea, the biomass of birds, seals and whales was estimated to be 0.044â€“0.070, 0.068-0.089 and 0.182â€“0.394 g mâˆ’2, respectively. The difference between bird and seal biomass was not statistically significant. The bird community was dominated in abundance (no. individuals) by Antarctic Petrels, Thalassoica antarctica, and in biomass by penguins. The mammal community was dominted in abundance by Crabeater Seals, Lobo-don carcinophagus, and in biomass by Crabeater Seals and Minke Whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata. Birds and mammals were concentrated in the same areas, in conjunction with oceanographic fronts, while large areas were devoid of these upper-trophic-level predators. Characteristics of pack-ice also affected the animalsâ€™ distributions, especially those of mammals.",1985,
A Novel Pruning Algorithm for Smoothing Feedforward Neural Networks Based on Group Lasso Method,"In this paper, we propose four new variants of the backpropagation algorithm to improve the generalization ability for feedforward neural networks. The basic idea of these methods stems from the Group Lasso concept which deals with the variable selection problem at the group level. There are two main drawbacks when the Group Lasso penalty has been directly employed during network training. They are numerical oscillations and theoretical challenges in computing the gradients at the origin. To overcome these obstacles, smoothing functions have then been introduced by approximating the Group Lasso penalty. Numerical experiments for classification and regression problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithms perform better than the other three classical penalization methods, Weight Decay, Weight Elimination, and Approximate Smoother, on both generalization and pruning efficiency. In addition, detailed simulations based on a specific data set have been performed to compare with some other common pruning strategies, which verify the advantages of the proposed algorithm. The pruning abilities of the proposed strategy have been investigated in detail for a relatively large data set, MNIST, in terms of various smoothing approximation cases.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems
Synaptopathies Heat Up: Mutations in STX1B in Fever-Associated Epilepsies,"Commentary STX1B encodes syntaxin1b, a critical component of the soluble â€“N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) complex that tethers synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic membrane and mediates neurotransmitter release at the synapse. Deletion of Stx1b in mice results in severe seizures and premature lethality coincident with dysfunction of neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Similarly, a temperature-sensitive paralytic mutation in Drosophila syntaxin results in failure of synaptic transmission at elevated temperatures. Mutations of other genes that encode SNARE complex proteins have previously been implicated in human epilepsy, including STXBP1 (syntaxin binding protein 1), DNM1 (dynamin 1), and SNAP25 (synaptosomalassociated protein 25). In the current study, the authors lay out a convincing case for mutation of STX1B causing fever-associated epilepsy, with evidence from both genetic and functional studies. First, the authors present data from two large pedigrees previously reported with linkage to chromosome 16p11.2 and 16p12q12. However, the previous studies had not identified the causative gene mutations. Using next-generation sequencing technology, the authors advanced the genetic analysis of these families by performing whole exome sequencing to identify the candidate mutations in the linkage intervals on chromosome 16. In the first family, there was a high degree of phenotypic variability among affected family members and a range of seizure types, including simple febrile seizures, and afebrile absence, generalized tonicâ€“clonic, and myoclonicâ€“astatic seizures. The authors defined a core phenotype that consisted of both febrile and afebrile seizures. They performed whole exome sequencing on three distant family members with the core phenotype and found a single, shared premature truncation mutation in STX1B. Follow-up sequencing of STX1B in additional family members demonstrated that the mutation cosegregated with the core phenotype. The second family had a more homogeneous phenotype that consisted of febrile seizures and afebrile atonic, dyscognitive, or generalized tonicâ€“clonic seizures between 10 months and 9 years of age. A similar whole exome sequencing approach was used to find the responsible mutation in the second family. They identified a complex indel mutation in STX1B that was not present in population databases and cosegregated with the seizure phenotype in the family. To further investigate the contribution of STX1B mutation to fever-associated epilepsies, they examined additional cohorts of familial and sporadic cases. The first cohort included 299 independent cases from which a single STX1B nonsense Mutations in STX1B, Encoding a Presynaptic Protein, Cause Fever-Associated Epilepsy Syndromes.",2015,Epilepsy Currents
"Structure of and relationships within and between the littoral, rock-substrate fish communities off four islands in the Canarian Archipelago","A total of 577 visual surveys (each of 5 min in duration and 100 m2 in area) were conducted throughout 1990 and 1991 at 32 locations off four Canary islands (i.e., Alegranza, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria and Tenerife) with the objects of describing the coastal fish community, comparing the differences in the fish fauna within and between these islands, and determining the biotic and abiotic factors related to the structure of the fish communities. A total of 76 species were recorded; the most common were Abudefduf luridus, Canthigaster rostrata, Chromis limbatus, Sparisoma cretense and Thalassoma pavo (94.28, 86.48, 52.34, 73.31, and 94.10% frequency of occurrence, respectively). The abundance and average size of the commercially important species was greater in those locations where there was less fishing pressure. The stepwise linear regression models were capable of explaining only a low amount of variation in the dependent variables (i.e., number of species, number of individuals, average size and species diversity) of the fish community. The independent variables recorded were date, time of day, depth, slope of the substrate, substrate type, percentage of sand, percentage of algae, algal height, number of sea urchins (Diadema antillarum) and the individual islands. An ANOVA, using the islands only as independent variables, indicated that each island contributed significantly to the variation in the four dependent variables and there were significant differences among the islands. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and a two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) determined associations between species and environmental attributes of the survey locations. The patterns in the TWINSPAN analysis indicated that localities had faunal resemblances based on the island off which where they were located.",1996,Marine Biology
The composite absolute penalties family for grouped and hierarchical variable selection,"Extracting useful information from high-dimensional data is an important focus of today's statistical research and practice. Penalized loss function minimization has been shown to be effective for this task both theoretically and empirically. With the virtues of both regularization and sparsity, the L 1 -penalized squared error minimization method Lasso has been popular in regression models and beyond. In this paper, we combine different norms including L 1 to form an intelligent penalty in order to add side information to the fitting of a regression or classification model to obtain reasonable estimates. Specifically, we introduce the Composite Absolute Penalties (CAP) family, which allows given grouping and hierarchical relationships between the predictors to be expressed. CAP penalties are built by defining groups and combining the properties of norm penalties at the across-group and within-group levels. Grouped selection occurs for nonoverlapping groups. Hierarchical variable selection is reached by defining groups with particular overlapping patterns. We propose using the BLASSO and cross-validation to compute CAP estimates in general. For a subfamily of CAP estimates involving only the L 1 and L âˆž norms, we introduce the iCAP algorithm to trace the entire regularization path for the grouped selection problem. Within this subfamily, unbiased estimates of the degrees of freedom (df) are derived so that the regularization parameter is selected without cross-validation. CAP is shown to improve on the predictive performance of the LASSO in a series of simulated experiments, including cases with p Â» n and possibly mis-specified groupings. When the complexity of a model is properly calculated, iCAP is seen to be parsimonious in the experiments.",2009,Annals of Statistics
Rectal 1% Tenofovir Gel Use Associates with Altered Epidermal Protein Expression,"Rectal use of a 1% tenofovir (TFV) gel is currently being evaluated for HIV prevention. While careful assessment of mucosal safety of candidate microbicides is a primary concern, tools to assess mucosal toxicity are limited. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a sensitive and high-throughput technique that can provide in-depth information on inflammation processes in biological systems. In this study, we utilized a proteomics approach to characterize mucosal responses in study participants involved in a phase 1 clinical trial of a rectal TFV-based gel. Project Gel was a phase 1 randomized (1:1), double-blind, multisite, placebo-controlled trial in which 24 participants received rectal TFV or a universal placebo [hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC)] over a course of 8 daily doses. Rectal mucosal swabs were collected after 0, 1, and 8 doses and were analyzed by label-free tandem mass spectrometry. Differential protein expression was evaluated using a combination of paired (time-effects) and unpaired (across study arm) t-tests, and multivariate [least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)] modeling. Within the TFV arm, 7% (17/249, pâ€‰<â€‰.05) and 10% (25/249, pâ€‰<â€‰.05) of total proteins changed after 1 and 8 daily applications of TFV gel, respectively, compared to 3% (7/249, pâ€‰<â€‰.05) and 6% (16/249, pâ€‰<â€‰.05) in the HEC arm. Biofunctional analysis associated TFV use with a decrease in epidermal barrier proteins (adj. pâ€‰=â€‰1.21â€‰Ã—â€‰10-10). Multivariate modeling identified 13 proteins that confidently separated TFV gel users (100% calibration and 96% cross-validation accuracy), including the epithelial integrity factors (FLMNB, CRNN, CALM), serpins (SPB13, SPB5), and cytoskeletal proteins (VILI, VIME, WRD1). This study suggested that daily rectal applications of a 1% TFV gel may be associated with mucosal proteome changes involving epidermal development. Further assessment of more extended use of TFV-gel is recommended to validate these initial associations.",2016,AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses
Prediction of malignancy by a radiomic signature from contrast agentâ€free diffusion MRI in suspicious breast lesions found on screening mammography.,"PURPOSE
To assess radiomics as a tool to determine how well lesions found suspicious on breast cancer screening X-ray mammography can be categorized into malignant and benign with unenhanced magnetic resonance (MR) mammography with diffusion-weighted imaging and T2 -weighted sequences.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
From an asymptomatic screening cohort, 50 women with mammographically suspicious findings were examined with contrast-enhanced breast MRI (ceMRI) at 1.5T. Out of this protocol an unenhanced, abbreviated diffusion-weighted imaging protocol (ueMRI) including T2 -weighted, (T2 w), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and DWI with background suppression (DWIBS) sequences and corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were extracted. From ueMRI-derived radiomic features, three Lasso-supervised machine-learning classifiers were constructed and compared with the clinical performance of a highly experienced radiologist: 1) univariate mean ADC model, 2) unconstrained radiomic model, 3) constrained radiomic model with mandatory inclusion of mean ADC.


RESULTS
The unconstrained and constrained radiomic classifiers consisted of 11 parameters each and achieved differentiation of malignant from benign lesions with a .632â€‰+â€‰bootstrap receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 84.2%/85.1%, compared to 77.4% for mean ADC and 95.9%/95.9% for the experienced radiologist using ceMRI/ueMRI.


CONCLUSION
In this pilot study we identified two ueMRI radiomics classifiers that performed well in the differentiation of malignant from benign lesions and achieved higher performance than the mean ADC parameter alone. Classification was lower than the almost perfect performance of a highly experienced breast radiologist. The potential of radiomics to provide a training-independent diagnostic decision tool is indicated. A performance reaching the human expert would be highly desirable and based on our results is considered possible when the concept is extended in larger cohorts with further development and validation of the technique.

Feature-inclusion stochastic search for Gaussian graphical models,"We describe a serial algorithm called feature-inclusion stochastic search, or FINCS, that uses online estimates of edge-inclusion probabilities to guide Bayesian model determination in Gaussian graphical models. FINCS is compared to MCMC, to Metropolis-based search methods, and to the popular lasso; it is found to be superior along a variety of dimensions, leading to better sets of discovered models, greater speed and stability, and reasonable estimates of edge-inclusion probabilities. We illustrate FINCS on an example involving mutual-fund data, where we compare the model-averaged predictive performance of models discovered with FINCS to those discovered by competing methods.",2008,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
Dormant conduction between contiguous pulmonary veins after pulmonary vein antrum isolation.,"A 77-year-old male with a history of drug-resistant paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypertension was referred to our hospital for AF ablation. He has a history of ischemic heart disease; however, echocardiographic parameters were normal. Pulmonary vein (PV) antral isolation was performed with a double lasso technique (Lasso, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA). After isolating all the PVs, dissociated PV activity (Fig. 1, asterisk) was observed constantly",2012,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology
An Empirical Analysis of ZeuS C&C Lifetime,"Botnets continue to pose a significant threat to network-based applications and communications over the Internet. A key mitigation strategy has been to take down command and control infrastructure of the botnets. The efficiency of those mitigation methods has not been extensively studied. In this paper we investigate several observable characteristics of botnet command and controls (C&C) and estimate the variability in the survival rate of these C&Cs and the factors that are related to such variability. Furthermore, we show that different type of mitigation efforts have different impact. Kaplan-Meier analysis is performed to evaluate C&C survival ratios in the particular case of the ZeuS botnet. Using a lasso penalized Cox regression model, we identify the factors that influence the lifetime of a C&C. Location, malware family type, registrar, hosting type and popularity are the fundamental factors that explain this variability. Our results show that location and type of hosting are the two factors that affect more significantly the C&C lifetime. Thus, ZeuS C&Cs in certain regions of Asia are prone to stay online longer that those located in Europe.",2015,
Scaling of non-linear viscoelastic transitions in soft colloidal glasses,"Submitted for the MAR06 Meeting of The American Physical Society Scaling of non-linear viscoelastic transitions in soft colloidal glasses MATTHEW HELGESON, NORMAN WAGNER, Center for Mol. and Eng. Thermodynamics, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Univ. of Delaware, Newark, DE 19711, DIMITRIS VLASSOPOULOS, FORTH, Inst. of Electronic Structure and Laser, Gr-71110, Heraklion, Crete, Greece â€” Soft colloidal particles undergo a transition to a glass-like state at sufficient concentration, due to kinetic trapping, similar to the glass transition in hard sphere systems. In this work we explore the use of rheological measurements as a tool to probe the mechanisms that lead to structure formation and breakage under shear in the glassy state for a monodisperse solution of multi-arm star polymers in an athermal solvent. Maxima in the loss moduli are observed with increasing strain amplitude at the onset of shear melting. We show that the transition to non-linear viscoelastic behavior and the onset of flow follow a systematic, rate-dependent trend. Specifically the critical strain increases with frequency. We discuss this trend in terms of phenomenological understanding of the kinetic trapping of soft colloids in the glassy state, leading to characterization of the softness of the colloidal glass as well as mechanisms of shear melting.

Biochemical genetics of sunfish. IV. Relationships of Centrachid genera,"We have examined electrophoretic variation in proteins encoded by 11-14 loci in species representing all nine genera of the Centrarchidae. A dendrogram based on allozyme information is compared to postulated relationships of sunfish genera based on general and specific morphologies, and on hybridizing propensity. The allozyme information correlates most strongly with that derived from a very detailed study of the acoustico-lateralis system by Branson and Moore (1962). Similarities between the two sets of data are observed (1) in the clustering together of species of Lepomis; (2) in the clustering of Lepomis with Micropterus; (3) in the placement of Acantharchus with Archoplites; and (4) in the very distant relationship of Elassoma to the other centrarchid genera. The levels of genetic similarity between centrarchid genera are compared to previously published levels of similarity between congeneric species of Lepomis, subspecies of Lepomis macrochirus, and geographic populations within the subspecies of L. m. macrochirus and L. m. purpurescens. Mean levels of genetic similarity (S) are as follows: between genera, S = 0.29; between congeneric species, S = 0.53; between subspecies of Lepomis macrochirus, S = 0.85; between geographic populations, S = 0.97.",1977,Copeia
