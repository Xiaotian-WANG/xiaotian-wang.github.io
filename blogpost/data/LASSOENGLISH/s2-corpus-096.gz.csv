New Perspectives on Immunologic Reactivity in Otitis Media with Effusion,"It has been well established that the normal midÂ­ dle ear mucosa (MEM) when ventilated by a normal eustachian tube is essentially devoid of immunologÂ­ ic elements such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. ' Furthermore, neutrophils are rarely, if ever, found in the normal M E M . Thus, the develÂ­ opment of an immune response in otitis media must occur following a series of events that are physiologÂ­ ically and bacteriologically abnormal. The great bulk of evidence woiild support the concept that eustachian tube dysfunction, or blockage, is preemÂ­ inent in the development of negative pressure in the middle ear . ' Following the development of negative pressure, an effusion occurs in the middle ear space. This fluid is usually of a serous nature, and it has been demonstrated that mucoid effusion does not occur in the germ-free animal, nor does the develÂ­ opment of an increased number of goblet cells and glands occur in the germ-free animal.^ Therefore, it appears that at least in acute otitis media and most forms of otitis media with effusion (OME) , bacteriologic factors are necessary for the influx of immuÂ­ nocompetent cells. One of the questions that has not been answered at the present time is the source of the immunocompetent cells that reach the middle ear in acute and chronic O M E . Three definite possiÂ­ bilities exist in this regard: 1) the gastrointestinalassociated lymphoid tissue ( G A L T ) , 2) the bronÂ­ chus-associated lymphoid tissue ( B A L T ) , and 3) the tonsils and adenoids.",1988,"Annals of Otology, Rhinology & Laryngology"
Speculative foundations of phenomenology,"This essay tries to account for a certain â€œspeculative turnâ€ in contemporary philosophy (Q. Meillassoux, G. Harman, M. Gabriel, etc.) from a phenomenological point of view. A first objective of it will consist in exposing the link between, on the one hand, the methodological sense of Husserlâ€™s concrete phenomenological analyses (concerning, for example, time and intersubjective structure of transcendental subjectivity,) and on the other hand, the consequences that follow from the grounding of phenomenology as first philosophy. This will allow a largely underestimated research angle to be opened up, one that I call a â€œconstructive phenomenology,â€ that constitutes an essential and original figure of transcendental philosophy in general. A second objective will then consist in the attempt to sketch the foundation of knowledge as knowledge, the core of a â€œphenomenological metaphysics.â€ Whereas the first part will remain within a Husserlian framework, the second will develop some elements of a â€œspeculative transcendentalismâ€ in a phenomenological perspective.",2012,Continental Philosophy Review
Ultraviolet Radiation Absorbance by Coral Reef Fish Mucus: photo-protection and Visual Communication,"Tropical reef fishes are exposed to high levels of damaging ultraviolet radiation. Here we report the widespread distribution of both UVA- and UVB-absorbing compounds in the epithelial mucus of these fishes. Mucus from 137 reef fish species was examined by spectrophotometry and 90% were found to have strong absorbance peaks between 290 and 400â€‰nm. Most fish species (78%) had more than one peak, that suggests a broad-band ultraviolet screening function for their mucus. Thalassoma duperrey, a tropical wrasse, was able to alter the absorbance of its epithelial mucus in response to both naturally and experimentally manipulated UV regimes. Visual modeling suggests that a fish with UV vision, such as Dascyllus albisella, could detect the changes in mucus spectra of T. duperrey that occurred in these experiments.",2004,Environmental Biology of Fishes

Research of software defect prediction model based on LASSO-SVM,"The prediction accuracy of most current software defect prediction models is not very high.To solve the problem,this paper investigated a software defect prediction model with the least absolute shrinkage and select operator(LASSO)and the support vector machine(SVM).At first,it reduced the dimension of the original data sets and extracted the data which was irrelevant with software defect prediction by taking advantage of the feature selection capability of LASSO.Then it found the correlated optimal weights of the SVM by making use of the parameter preference capability of cross validation.At last,it fi-nished software defect prediction by utilizing the non-linear computing power of SVM.The simulation experiment indicated that proposed method owe a higher prediction precision than the traditional ones and predicted faster.",2013,Application Research of Computers
Multilocus Sequence Analysis for Assessment of Phylogenetic Diversity and Biogeography in Thalassospira Bacteria from Diverse Marine Environments,"Thalassospira bacteria are widespread and have been isolated from various marine environments. Less is known about their genetic diversity and biogeography, as well as their role in marine environments, many of them cannot be discriminated merely using the 16S rRNA gene. To address these issues, in this report, the phylogenetic analysis of 58 strains from seawater and deep sea sediments were carried out using the multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on acsA, aroE, gyrB, mutL, rpoD and trpB genes, and the DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) based on genome sequences. The MLSA analysis demonstrated that the 58 strains were clearly separated into 15 lineages, corresponding to seven validly described species and eight potential novel species. The DDH and ANI values further confirmed the validity of the MLSA analysis and eight potential novel species. The MLSA interspecies gap of the genus Thalassospira was determined to be 96.16-97.12% sequence identity on the basis of the combined analyses of the DDH and MLSA, while the ANIm interspecies gap was 95.76-97.20% based on the in silico DDH analysis. Meanwhile, phylogenetic analyses showed that the Thalassospira bacteria exhibited distribution pattern to a certain degree according to geographic regions. Moreover, they clustered together according to the habitats depth. For short, the phylogenetic analyses and biogeography of the Thalassospira bacteria were systematically investigated for the first time. These results will be helpful to explore further their ecological role and adaptive evolution in marine environments.",2014,PLoS ONE
Linear Regression with Limited Observation,"We consider the most common variants of linear regression, including Ridge, Lasso and Support-vector regression, in a setting where the learner is allowed to observe only a fixed number of attributes of each example at training time. We present simple and efficient algorithms for these problems: for Lasso and Ridge regression they need the same total number of attributes (up to constants) as do full-information algorithms, for reaching a certain accuracy. For Support-vector regression, we require exponentially less attributes compared to the state of the art. By that, we resolve an open problem recently posed by Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2010). 
 
Experiments show the theoretical bounds to be justified by superior performance compared to the state of the art.",2012,ArXiv
Pathway Detection Based on Hierarchical LASSO Regression Model,"Rapid and accurate identification of potentially interested pathways through the analysis of genome-wide expres- sion profiles remains an important challenge in bioinformatics. Most existing methods are based on hypothesis testing, such as GSEA. These methods mainly focus on individual pathways and rank them based on their individual strengths. However, biolog- ical pathways often work together to function. Therefore, it is important to consider their correlations in detection of pathways that are most closely related to the phenotypes. Considering this problem in the framework of variable selection, we propose a hierarchical LASSO regression (HLR) model to detect differen- tially expressed gene pathways, which automatically takes into account the correlation structure among the genes via regression. This approach is able to both select important gene pathways and remove unimportant genes within selected pathways. Both simulation and real data analysis show promising results.",2009,2009 2nd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics
Cadaveric Biomechanical Analysis of 3 Lateral Ulnar Collateral Ligament Reconstructions,"Objective: To biomechanically assess the angular stability provided by 3 techniques for reconstruction of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament. Methods: Eight cadaveric elbows were tested with the lateral collateral ligament complex intact, disrupted from the origin at the lateral epicondyle, and reconstructed with 3 different techniques using ulnar bone tunnels: a suture â€œlassoâ€ or palmaris longus tendon â€œlassoâ€ both docked with a metal button at the origin, and a doubled-over palmaris longus tendon docked with metal buttons at both the origin and ulnar insertion. Elbows were tested with a physiologic elbow simulator, and varus angular position was quantified with an optical tracking system. Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated measures analysis of variance test to determine whether significance existed, and a Tukey post hoc analysis to compare statistical difference between native, disrupted, and repair states. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between all repairs and the disrupted state (P < 0.05). The varus angulation after the repairs showed that the suture reconstruction was closest to the native case. The tendon reconstructions were similar to each other but less similar to the native elbow. Quantitatively, the suture reconstruction was within an average of 0.86 degrees of the native elbow throughout range of motion. Conclusions: A suture reconstruction was most similar to a native elbow, but both tendon reconstructions significantly improved angular stability under varus gravitational loads.",2018,Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma
Unmixing of multispectral photoacoustic images,"Photoacoustic imaging is an hybrid modality to image biological tissues. Using multispectral optical excitation, photoacoustic imaging allows to obtain functional images due to the fact that a tissue has a specific optical absorption depending on the used wavelengths. Quantification of multispectral photoacoustic images can be of great interest to different applications by quantifying oxygenated (HbO2) and deoxygenated (Hb) blood in tissue. Quantification can be done by examining the abundance maps resulting from unmixing methods. Two hyperspectral unmixing methods, namely Group Lasso with Unit sum and Positivity constraints (GLUP) and Fully Constrained Least-Square (FCLS), are used to quantify multispectral photoacoustic images. Experiments using two synthetic and one experimental dataset show that unmixing methods provide good quantification performances, which is of great interest for various medical applications.",2017,
Reducing the Computational and Communication Complexity of a Distributed Optimization for Regularized Logistic Regression,"In this paper, we propose a new distributed optimization method that computes a Lasso estimator for logistic regression in the case when two parties have explanatory variables corresponding to distinct attributes. An existing protocol using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for linear regression can be applied to logistic regression. However, this protocol needs an underlying iterative method such as the gradient method. We show that the proposed protocol using the generalized Bregman ADMM, which removes the necessity to use the underlying iterative method, requires lower computational and communication complexity.",2019,"2019 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC)"
Fair Realism: The Aesthetics of Restraint in Barbara Guestâ€™s Collaborations,"An early Barbara Guest poem entitled â€œHeroic Stagesâ€ (1962) is dedicated to the painter Grace Hartigan. A second-generation abstract expressionist who painted under the pseudonym â€œGeorge,â€ Hartigan was known for her ability to create paintings that slide gracefully between abstraction and figuration, high art and kitsch, tradition and innovation. These stylistic signatures put her at odds with Clement Greenbergâ€™s teleology for modern painting, and particularly his argument that pure opticality should be the apotheosis of modern art. Hartigan also rejected Greenbergâ€™s insistence on sharp distinctions between painting and literature, and in an interview, offered comparisons between the work of poets and painters: â€œA line is like a lasso,â€ the painter stated in 1950, â€œyou throw it over your head and you grab something. Itâ€™s a fascination that doesnâ€™t seem to fascinate many artists these days. But it fascinates me. Itâ€™s like writing. You can read a line in a painting almost the way you can read a word in a poemâ€ (Hartigan, â€œMakingâ€ 50).",2013,

Animal-plant relationships and paleobiogeography of an Eocene seagrass community from Florida,"An excellent example of a preserved seagrass community occurs in the late Middle Eocene Avon Park Formation of west-central, peninsular Florida. This fossil assemblage provides some of the first detailed information about the evolutionary development of animal/seagrass interactions, and in addition, documents the pre-Miocene existence of seagrasses in Florida. The most common seagrasses present are species of Thalassodendron and Cymodocea. A strong Tethyan paleobiogeographic connection, previously noted among the Eocene molluscs of Florida, is also supported by the seagrasses and dugongs. We hypothesize that this assemblage of seagrasses was much more widespread in the Neotropics during the Paleogene and into the Neogene. Their absence now can be explained by the changing circulation patterns and cooling initiated by the closing of the Panamanian Isthmus and/or the onset of Plio-Pleistocene glaciation",1990,PALAIOS
Prediction of Graduation Delay Based on Student Characterisitics and Performance,"A college studentâ€™s success depends on many factors including pre-university characteristics and university student support services. Student graduation rates are often used as an objective metric to measure institutional effectiveness. This work studies the impact of such factors on graduation rates, with a particular focus on delay in graduation. In this work, we used feature selection methods to identify a subset of the pre-institutional features with the highest discriminative power. In particular, Forward Selection with Linear Regression, Backward Elimination with Linear Regression, and Lasso Regression were applied. The feature sets were selected in a multivariate fashion. High school GPA, ACT scores, studentâ€™s high school, financial aid received, and first generation status were found to be important for predicting success. In order to predict delay in graduation, we trained predictive models using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gaussian Processes (GPs), and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs) on real student data. The difference in performance among the models is negligible with respect to overall accuracies obtained. Further analysis showed that DBMs outperform SVMs in terms of precision and recall for individual",2017,
Classifying Lung Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma using RNA-Seq Data,"Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are two primary subtypes of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Currently, the most widely used method to discriminate between LUAD and LUSC is hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. However, this method sometimes is unable to make the precise diagnosis on LUAD or LUSC. More accurate diagnostic approaches are highly desired. Methods: We propose to use gene expression profile to discriminate NSCLC patientâ€™s subtype. We leveraged RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and randomly split the data into training and testing subsets. To construct classifiers based on the training data, we considered three methods: logistic regression on principal components (PCR), logistic regression with LASSO shrinkage (LASSO), and kth nearest neighbors (KNN). Performances of classifiers were evaluated and compared based on the testing data. Results: All gene expression-based classifiers show high accuracy in discriminating LUSC and LUAD. The classifier obtained by LASSO has the smallest overall misclassification rate of 3.42% (95% CI: 3.25%-3.60%) when using 0.5 as the cutoff value for the predicted probability of belonging to a subtype, followed by classifiers obtained by PCR (4.36%, 95% CI: 4.23%4.49%) and KNN (8.70%, 95% CI: 8.57%-8.83%). The LASSO classifier also has the highest average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.993, compared to PCR (0.987) and KNN (0.965). Conclusions: Our results suggest that mRNA expressions are highly informative for classifying NSCLC subtypes and may potentially be used to assist clinical diagnosis.",2017,
"Chironomidae from Gough, Nightingale and Tristan da Cunha islands","The resurrection of trans-oceanic dispersal is the most striking aspect of a major shift in historical biogeography toward a more even balance between vicariance and dispersal explanations. Molecular dating of lineage divergences favors oceanic dispersal over tectonic vicariance as an explanation for disjunct distributions in a wide variety of taxa. Although many oceanic islands harbor a disproportionately high biodiversity and number of endemic taxa, the chironomid fauna of the South Atlantic islands of Gough, Nightingale and Tristan da Cunha apparently consists of 6 species only: Telmatogeton goughi sp. n. (described as male and female), Limnophyes minimus (Meigen), Smittia sp. (described as female), Thalassosmittia christinae sp. n. (described as female), Clunio jonesi sp. n. (described as male) and Allocladius lusciniolus Saether et Andersen (described as female). Except for the marine T. goughi and C. jonesi the other species are parthenogenetic. Limnophyes minimus and A. lusciniolus dominate the chironomid fauna. Telmatogeton goughi is close to T. sanctipauli (Schiner). Thalassosmittia christinae differs from T. thalassophila (Bequaert et Goetghebuer) by having hairy eyes and antenna with subapical seta. Clunio jonesi differs from C. africanus and C. gerlachi by having ultimate flagellomere as long as the 4 preceding segments and gonostylus with only 1â€“2 apical spines. Allocladius lusciniolus differs from other known females of the genus by having 1â€“5 setae apically on M 1+2 .",2011,Zootaxa
ProdLight: A Lightweight Ontology for Product Description Based on Datatype Properties,"Web pages representing offerings of products and services are a major source of data for Semantic Web-based e-commerce. This data could be useful for numerous applications, e.g. (1) more precise product search engines and shopping bots, (2) aggregation or enrichment of multi-vendor catalogs using public product descriptions, or (3) the automated discovery of additional alternatives based on the combination of multiple items. While there are already some ontologies for products and services available, they are very large in size (20-70,000 classes), and thus not always suitable as ontology imports. In this paper, we take a different approach: We represent the semantics of offerings on the Web using a very lightweight ontology of datatype properties in combination with popular classifications like UNSPSC and eCl@ss. We then demonstrate how this representation can be mapped easily to comprehensive ontologies for products and services like eClassOWL. Our approach provides a straightforward solution for annotating offerings on the Web while avoiding the overhead of importing fully-fledged products and services ontologies in every single annotation. We can show that our proposal has technical advantages and eliminates legal problems when reusing existing standards.",2007,

Serological and spatial analysis of alphavirus and flavivirus prevalence and risk factors in a rural community in western Kenya,"Alphaviruses, such as chikungunya virus, and flaviviruses, such as dengue virus, are (re)-emerging arboviruses that are endemic in tropical environments. In Africa, arbovirus infections are often undiagnosed and unreported, with febrile illnesses often assumed to be malaria. This cross-sectional study aimed to characterize the seroprevalence of alphaviruses and flaviviruses among children (ages 5-14, n = 250) and adults (ages 15 â‰¥ 75, n = 250) in western Kenya. Risk factors for seropositivity were explored using Lasso regression. Overall, 67% of participants showed alphavirus seropositivity (CI95 63%-70%), and 1.6% of participants showed flavivirus seropositivity (CI95 0.7%-3%). Children aged 10-14 were more likely to be seropositive to an alphavirus than adults (p < 0.001), suggesting a recent transmission period. Alphavirus and flavivirus seropositivity was detected in the youngest participants (age 5-9), providing evidence of inter-epidemic transmission. Demographic variables that were significantly different amongst those with previous infection versus those without infection included age, education level, and occupation. Behavioral and environmental variables significantly different amongst those in with previous infection to those without infection included taking animals for grazing, fishing, and recent village flooding. Experience of recent fever was also found to be a significant indicator of infection (p = 0.027). These results confirm alphavirus and flavivirus exposure in western Kenya, while illustrating significantly higher alphavirus transmission compared to previous studies.",2017,PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
On the variability of regression shrinkage methods for clinical prediction models: simulation study on predictive performance,"When developing risk prediction models, shrinkage methods are recommended, especially when the sample size is limited. Several earlier studies have shown that the shrinkage of model coefficients can reduce overfitting of the prediction model and subsequently result in better predictive performance on average. In this simulation study, we aimed to investigate the variability of regression shrinkage on predictive performance for a binary outcome, with focus on the calibration slope. The slope indicates whether risk predictions are too extreme (slope 1). We investigated the following shrinkage methods in comparison to standard maximum likelihood estimation: uniform shrinkage (likelihood-based and bootstrap-based), ridge regression, penalized maximum likelihood, LASSO regression, adaptive LASSO, non-negative garrote, and Firth's correction. There were three main findings. First, shrinkage improved calibration slopes on average. Second, the between-sample variability of calibration slopes was often increased relative to maximum likelihood. Among the shrinkage methods, the bootstrap-based uniform shrinkage worked well overall. In contrast to other shrinkage approaches, Firth's correction had only a small shrinkage effect but did so with low variability. Third, the correlation between the estimated shrinkage and the optimal shrinkage to remove overfitting was typically negative. Hence, although shrinkage improved predictions on average, it often worked poorly in individual datasets, in particular when shrinkage was most needed. The observed variability of shrinkage methods implies that these methods do not solve problems associated with small sample size or low number of events per variable.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
On building and publishing Linked Open Schema from social Web sites,"Abstract Schema-level knowledge is important for different semantic applications, such as reasoning, data integration and question answering. Compared with billions of triples describing millions of instances, current Linking Open Data has only a limited number of triples representing schema-level knowledge. To facilitate multilingual schema-level knowledge mining, we propose a general approach to learn Linked Open Schema (LOS) in different languages from social Web sites, which contain rich sources (i.e. taxonomies composed of categories and folksonomies consisting of tags) for mining large-scale schema-level knowledge. The core part of the proposed approach is a semi-supervised learning method integrating rules to capture equal , subClassOf and relate relations among the collected categories and tags. We respectively apply the proposed approach to the selected English social Web sites and the Chinese ones, resulting in an English LOS and a Chinese LOS. We publish the English LOS and the Chinese one as open data on the Web with three access levels, i.e. data dump , lookup service and SPARQL endpoint . Experimental results show the high accuracy of the relations in the English LOS and the Chinese one. Compared with DBpedia, Yago, BabelNet, and Freebase, both the English LOS and the Chinese one not only have large-scale concepts, but also contain the largest number of subClassOf relations.",2018,J.

Statistical Methods in Mapping Complex Diseases,"Genome-wide association studies have become a standard tool for disease gene discovery over the past few years. These studies have successfully identified genetic variants attributed to complex diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Various statistical methods have been developed with the goal of improving power to find disease causing variants. The major focus of this dissertation is to develop statistical methods related to gene mapping studies with its application in real datasets to identify genetic markers associated with complex human diseases. In my first project, I developed a method to detect gene-gene interactions by incorporating linkage disequilibrium (LD) information provided by external datasets such as the International HapMap or the 1000 Genomes Projects. The next two projects in my dissertation are related to the analysis of secondary phenotypes in case-control genetic association studies. In these studies, a set of correlated secondary phenotypes that may share common genetic factors with disease status are often collected. However, due to unequal sampling probabilities between cases and controls, the standard regression approach for examination of these secondary phenotype can yield inflated type I error rates when the test SNPs are associated with the disease. To solve this issue, I propose a Gaussian copula approach to jointly model the disease status and the secondary phenotype. In my second project, I consider only one marker in the model and perform a test to access whether the marker is associated with the secondary phenotype in the Gaussian copula framework. In my third project, I extend the copula-based approach to include a large number of candidate SNPs in the model. I propose a variable selection approach to select markers which are associated with the secondary phenotype by applying a lasso penalty to the log-likelihood function.

Group lasso regularized multiple kernel learning for heterogeneous feature selection,"We propose a novel multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm with a group lasso regularizer, called group lasso regularized MKL (GL-MKL), for heterogeneous feature selection. We extend the existing MKL algorithm and impose a mixed â„“1 and â„“2 norm constraint (known as group lasso) as the regularizer. Our GL-MKL determines the optimal base kernels, including the associated weights and kernel parameters, and results in a compact set of features for comparable or improved recognition performance. The use of our GL-MKL avoids the problem of choosing the proper technique to normalize the feature attributes collected from heterogeneous domains (and thus with different properties and distribution ranges). Our approach does not need to exhaustively search for the entire feature space when performing feature selection like prior sequential-based feature selection methods did, and we do not require any prior knowledge on the optimal size of the feature subset either. Comparisons with existing MKL or sequential-based feature selection methods on a variety of datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method in selecting a compact feature subset for comparable or improved classification performance.",2011,The 2011 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks
Regularization schemes for transfer learning with convolutional networks. (StratÃ©gies de rÃ©gularisation pour l'apprentissage par transfert des rÃ©seaux de neurones Ã  convolution),"Transfer learning with deep convolutional neural networks significantly reduces the computation and data overhead of the training process and boosts the performance on the target task, compared to training from scratch. However, transfer learning with a deep network may cause the model to forget the knowledge acquired when learning the source task, leading to the so-called catastrophic forgetting. Since the efficiency of transfer learning derives from the knowledge acquired on the source task, this knowledge should be preserved during transfer. This thesis solves this problem of forgetting by proposing two regularization schemes that preserve the knowledge during transfer. First we investigate several forms of parameter regularization, all of which explicitly promote the similarity of the final solution with the initial model, based on the L1, L2, and Group-Lasso penalties. We also propose the variants that use Fisher information as a metric for measuring the importance of parameters. We validate these parameter regularization approaches on various tasks. The second regularization scheme is based on the theory of optimal transport, which enables to estimate the dissimilarity between two distributions. We benefit from optimal transport to penalize the deviations of high-level representations between the source and target task, with the same objective of preserving knowledge during transfer learning. With a mild increase in computation time during training, this novel regularization approach improves the performance of the target tasks, and yields higher accuracy on image classification tasks compared to parameter regularization approaches.",2019,
Late Accretion and the Late Veneer,"bar (Lodders 2003).Refractory lithophile elements, which condense at high temperatures, (e.g Ca, Ti, Sc,Zr,REE) are in approximately the same ratios one to another as in the CI chondrite classof primitive meteorites. This gives us a reference level for all other elements. Refractorysiderophile elements are depleted in BSE due to their partitioning into the core. To a rstapproximation one can make a mass balance between the BSE and the missing contents(assuming chondritic ratios in bulk Earth) of these siderophile elements and obtain themass of the core and its elemental concentrations (dominated by Fe). Additionally, as canbe seen in Figure 1, those elements with low condensation temperatures, which were volatilein the solar nebula, are depleted in BSE relative to the chondritic reference. This is due, asdiscussed in section 5, to the Earth being dominated by high temperature materials whichcondensed and accreted in the inner solar system. Note that the same relationship betweensiderophile and lithophile elements observed in refractory elements applies to the more",2015,arXiv: Earth and Planetary Astrophysics
The crystal Habits and Formation Mechanism of Polar crystal,"The theoretic model of the growth units of anionic coordination polyhedra is applied to studythe crystal habits of some poar crystals in this paper. From the analysis of the appearance regu-larities of different groups of faces with relation to the crystallographic direction of the anionic co-ordination polyhedra of the crystals by the viewpoint of crystal chemistry, it was proPosed thatthe growth rates of various faces are determined by the stability of the attachment of the anioniccoordinatbo Polyhedra on the different groups of faces. The anionic coordination poyhedra willassociate each other to form growth units with different dimensions depending on the growthtemperature and alkaline concentrations. The main reason for the morphology varieties of growncrystals is that the ratio of growth rates on various faces changs with various dimensions of thegrowth units incorporated in these faces. It is also suggested if the periedic bond chains in PBCtheory are considered as the chains of anionic coordination polyhedra, the crystal habits of Polarcrystals which were difficult to comprehend can easily be illustrated and the applications of PBCtheory can be extended more than ever be fore.",1997,Chinese Journal of Structural Chemistry
Participatory habitat characterization and GIS data base development for the conservation and management of Sea Turtles in South Coast Kenya,"Three sites in south coast Kenya i.e. Msambweni, Funzi and Bodo were studied with an overall objective of characterizing the existing sea turtle nesting and foraging habitats.

The targeted foraging grounds consisted of seagrass beds and associated food items which included sponges and mollusks. Participatory approaches as well a stratified sampling design were used in studying both habitats. A total of 10 beach stretches measuring 5.84km were identified in both Funzi and Msambweni. Msambweni beaches had a higher index of human pressure than Funzi beaches although the later had a higher natural predation index in relation to clutch and nesting femalesâ€™ survival. The mean temperature range at a depth of 10-30cm was higher for the Funzi hatchery when compared with samples from Funzi beaches (t= 2.7, p<0.05) but was not significant when compared with measurements from Bodo beach stretches (t= 0.05, p>0.05). However there were significant differences in temperature range reported within sites i.e. Funzi (t= 1.73, p< 0.05) and Msambweni beaches (t= 4.00, p<0.05) at depths of 10-30cm. Funzi had the highest mean temperature range at all depth measurements. Seagrass cover ranged from 1.3-44.23% but there was no significant differences (p>0.5) between sites. Most of the sampling stations were dominated by Thelassodendron ciliatum, Thalassia hemprichii, Siringodium isoetifolium, and Halodule uninervis. A two-factor ranking exercise identified fisheries, sea urchins and pollution as the most immediate threats to sea turtle habitats within the study sites. The overall mean densities of sponges were higher in Msambweni than in Funzi Bodo sites pooled (p<0.001) while there were more mollusks within the Funzi-Bodo channels compared to Msambweni (p<0.001). The distribution of gelatins was not significant between the two sites (p>0.05). Interviews with fishermen and observations suggest a spatial coincidence between specific seagrass pastures and green turtle sightings. During the survey period 67 green turtle nests were sighted in Funzi and Msambweni beaches and a total of 32 mortality cases reported.",2005,
Proximal methods for the latent group lasso penalty,"We consider a regularized least squares problem, with regularization by structured sparsity-inducing norms, which extend the usual â„“1 and the group lasso penalty, by allowing the subsets to overlap. Such regularizations lead to nonsmooth problems that are difficult to optimize, and we propose in this paper a suitable version of an accelerated proximal method to solve them. We prove convergence of a nested procedure, obtained composing an accelerated proximal method with an inner algorithm for computing the proximity operator. By exploiting the geometrical properties of the penalty, we devise a new active set strategy, thanks to which the inner iteration is relatively fast, thus guaranteeing good computational performances of the overall algorithm. Our approach allows to deal with high dimensional problems without pre-processing for dimensionality reduction, leading to better computational and prediction performances with respect to the state-of-the art methods, as shown empirically both on toy and real data.",2014,Computational Optimization and Applications
GAP Safe screening rules for sparse multi-task and multi-class models,"High dimensional regression benefits from sparsity promoting regularizations. Screening rules leverage the known sparsity of the solution by ignoring some variables in the optimization, hence speeding up solvers. When the procedure is proven not to discard features wrongly the rules are said to be safe. In this paper we derive new safe rules for generalized linear models regularized with l1 and l1/ l2 norms. The rules are based on duality gap computations and spherical safe regions whose diameters converge to zero. This allows to discard safely more variables, in particular for low regularization parameters. The GAP Safe rule can cope with any iterative solver and we illustrate its performance on coordinate descent for multi-task Lasso, binary and multinomial logistic regression, demonstrating significant speed ups on all tested datasets with respect to previous safe rules.",2015,
Returns to Womenâ€™s Education Using Optimal IV Selection,"This paper investigates the returns to womenâ€™s education by applying the recently developed post-Lasso instrumental variable approach. Using the 2010 American Community Survey, we find that an extra year of education increases married women's own income by $4,853 and spouse income by $8,391. There is also supporting evidence for assortative mating such that one additional year of women's education increases spouseâ€™s education by 0.575 years. Our results demonstrate the advantages of the post-Lasso approach: It is less subject to asymptotic bias and reduces standard errors, which differs from the estimates found with commonly used instruments, namely birth quarters in studies on returns to education.",2019,Applied Economics
A note on the calculation of the dielectric function for a homogeneous plasma,"Abstract A method of calculating the dielectric function for a homogeneous plasma using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is discussed. This method dispenses with the use of any kinetic equation in contrast to the usual methods. Calculations using firstly the â€œnoninteracting dressedâ€ particle picture and secondly the expression for the density correlation function obtained by Balescu, are shown to lead to the same dielectric function as obtained usually from the Vlassov equation.",1966,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena
A Generalization of Linearized Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers with Indefinite Proximal Regularization and Smaller Proximal Parameter,"The linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), with indefinite proximal regularization, has been proved to be efficient for solving separable convex optimization subject to linear constraints. In this paper, we present a generalization of linearized ADMM (GLADMM) to solve the separable convex minimization model, which linearizes all the subproblems by choosing a proper positive or indefinite proximal regularization term and updates the Lagrangian multiplier twice in different ways. Furthermore, the proposed G-LADMM can be expressed as a proximal point algorithm (PPA), and all the subproblems are just to estimate the proximity operator of the function in the objective. We specify the domain of the proximal parameter and stepsizes to guarantee that G-LADMM is globally convergent. It turns out that our convergence domain of the proximal parameter and stepsizes is significantly larger than other convergence domains in the literature. The numerical experiments illustrate the improvements of the proposed G-LADMM to solve LASSO and image decomposition problems.",2018,
Cognitive Profiling Related to Cerebral Amyloid Beta Burden Using Machine Learning Approaches,"Background: Cerebral amyloid beta (AÎ²) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AÎ² can be detected in vivo with amyloid imaging or cerebrospinal fluid assessments. However, these technologies can be both expensive and invasive, and their accessibility is limited in many clinical settings. Hence the current study aims to identify multivariate cost-efficient markers for AÎ² positivity among non-demented individuals using machine learning (ML) approaches. Methods: The relationship between cost-efficient candidate markers and AÎ² status was examined by analyzing 762 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-2 cohort at baseline visit (286 cognitively normal, 332 with mild cognitive impairment, and 144 with AD; mean age 73.2 years, range 55-90). Demographic variables (age, gender, education, and APOE status) and neuropsychological test scores were used as predictors in an ML algorithm. Cerebral AÎ² burden and AÎ² positivity were measured using 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography images. The adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) ML algorithm was implemented to identify cognitive performance and demographic variables and distinguish individuals from the population at high risk for cerebral AÎ² burden. For generalizability, results were further checked by randomly dividing the data into training sets and test sets and checking predictive performances by 10-fold cross-validation. Results: Out of neuropsychological predictors, visuospatial ability and episodic memory test results were consistently significant predictors for AÎ² positivity across subgroups with demographic variables and other cognitive measures considered. The adaptive LASSO model using out-of-sample classification could distinguish abnormal levels of AÎ². The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.754 in the mild change group, 0.803 in the moderate change group, and 0.864 in the severe change group, respectively. Conclusion: Our results showed that the cost-efficient neuropsychological model with demographics could predict AÎ² positivity, suggesting a potential surrogate method for detecting AÎ² deposition non-invasively with clinical utility. More specifically, it could be a very brief screening tool in various settings to recruit participants with potential biomarker evidence of AD brain pathology. These identified individuals would be valuable participants in secondary prevention trials aimed at detecting an anti-amyloid drug effect in the non-demented population.",2019,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience
"The Voice of Skogula in â€˜Beasts Royalâ€™ and a Story of the Tagus Estuary (Lisbon, Portugal) as Seen through a Whaleâ€™s-Eye View","Patrick Oâ€™Brian inspired this work, with his 1934 book of chronicles â€œBeasts Royal,â€ where he gives a voice to animals. Therein, among other animals, we find Skogula, a young sperm whale journeying with his family group across the South Seas and his views on the surrounding world, both underwater and on land. This paper tells a story of historical natural events, from the viewpoint of a fin whale that travelled, rested and stranded in the Tagus estuary mouth (Lisbon, Portugal) during the early 16th century. It allows us to move across time and explore the past of this estuarine ecosystem. What kind of changes took place and how can literature and heritage contribute to understand peoplesâ€™ constructions of past environments, local maritime histories and memories? In the second part of this essay we present a fictional short story, supported on historical documental sources and imagery research where Lily, the whale, is the main character. Thus, we see the Tagus estuary as perceived through this whaleâ€™s-eye view. Finally, we discuss past earthquakes, whale strandings, the occurrence of seals and dolphins and peoplesâ€™ perceptions of the Tagus coastal environment across time. We expect to make a contribution to the field of the marine environmental humanities. We will do so both by addressing, by means of this literary approach, the writing of â€œnew thalassographies,â€ oceanic historiographies and â€œhistoricitiesâ€ and by including all intervening actorsâ€”people, animals and the physical spaceâ€”in the understanding of the past of more-than-human aquatic worlds.",2019,Humanities research
"Endoscopic placement of flatus tube using ""lasso"" technique with snare wire.","A 55-year old man presented with acute sigmoid volvulus. The distal level of obstruction was above the level which could be reached by the rigid sigmoidoscope to allow decompression, and so a flatus tube was ""lassoed"" onto the side of a flexible endoscope which allowed accurate placement under direct vision. This technique allows accurate placement of catheters, feeding tubes and other devices endoscopically, which cannot be placed through the instrument channel of the endoscope.",2006,World journal of gastroenterology
Hierarchical Sparse Modeling: A Choice of Two Group Lasso Formulations,"Demanding sparsity in estimated models has become a routine 
practice in statistics. In many situations, we wish to require that the sparsity 
patterns attained honor certain problem-specific constraints. Hierarchical 
sparse modeling (HSM) refers to situations in which these constraints 
specify that one set of parameters be set to zero whenever another is set to 
zero. In recent years, numerous papers have developed convex regularizers 
for this form of sparsity structure, which arises in many areas of statistics 
including interaction modeling, time series analysis, and covariance estimation. 
In this paper, we observe that these methods fall into two frameworks, 
the group lasso (GL) and latent overlapping group lasso (LOG), which have 
not been systematically compared in the context of HSM. The purpose of this 
paper is to provide a side-by-side comparison of these two frameworks for 
HSM in terms of their statistical properties and computational efficiency. We 
call special attention to GLâ€™s more aggressive shrinkage of parameters deep 
in the hierarchy, a property not shared by LOG. In terms of computation, 
we introduce a finite-step algorithm that exactly solves the proximal operator 
of LOG for a certain simple HSM structure; we later exploit this to develop 
a novel path-based block coordinate descent scheme for general HSM 
structures. Both algorithms greatly improve the computational performance 
of LOG. Finally, we compare the two methods in the context of covariance 
estimation, where we introduce a new sparsely-banded estimator using LOG, 
which we show achieves the statistical advantages of an existing GL-based 
method but is simpler to express and more efficient to compute.",2017,Statistical Science
Scattering and Coulomb blockade in magnetotunneling across singly and multiply connected barriers in quasi-two-dimensional systems,"Abstract We present a theoretical analysis of tunneling through singly (plane) and multiply (ring and lasso) connected potential harriers in a quasi-two-dimensional electron gas under the effect of a high magnetic field. The tunneling properties are essentially determined by the continuous (plane) or the discrete (ring and lasso) nature of the spectrum. When the spectrum is discrete charge transfer, either by elastic tunneling or by different scattering processes (impurities, electron-phonon, electron-electron, etc.), is non-negligible only for a reduced set of values of the magnetic field. Multiply connected barriers present strong Coulomb blockade effects being characterized by very low capacitances (10 âˆ’17 F).",1992,Surface Science
"Outside-In Singleâ€“Lasso Loop Technique for Meniscal Repair: Fast, Economic, and Reproducible","The current understanding of the biomechanical role of the meniscus, in conjunction with the increasing efforts to achieve its preservation within the orthopaedic community during treatment of meniscal lesions, has prompted the development of different meniscal repair techniques. The outside-in technique is recommended for anterior horn and middle-segment meniscal tears and has been recognized as a low-cost procedure with a low incidence of complications. Diverse modifications of this technique have been published over the past decade. On the basis of these previous outside-in technique modifications and aiming to simplify and reduce the number of surgical steps, as well as simplify suture and/or instrument manipulation, during this technique, we describe the single-lasso loop outside-in technique for meniscal repair. We believe this modified technique represents a simplified, economic, and highly reproducible procedure option whenever an outside-in technique for meniscal repair is considered.",2018,Arthroscopy Techniques
Thalassospira xiamenensis sp. nov. and Thalassospira profundimaris sp. nov.,"Two bacterial strains, M-5T and WP0211T, were isolated from the surface water of a waste-oil pool in a coastal dock and from a deep-sea sediment sample from the West Pacific Ocean, respectively. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that both strains belonged to the class Alphaproteobacteria and were closely related to Thalassospira lucentensis (96.1 and 96.2 %, gene sequence similarity, respectively). Based on the results of physiological and biochemical tests, as well as DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, it is suggested that these isolates represent two novel species of the genus Thalassospira. Various traits allow both novel strains to be differentiated from Thalassospira lucentensis, including oxygen requirement, nitrate reduction and denitrification abilities and major fatty acid profiles, as well as their ability to utilize six different carbon sources. Furthermore, the novel strains may be readily distinguished from each other by differences in their motility, flagellation, growth at 4 degrees C and 40 degrees C, their ability to hydrolyse Tween 40 and Tween 80, their utilization of 19 different carbon sources and by quantitative differences in their fatty acid contents. It is proposed that the isolates represent two novel species for which the names Thalassospira xiamenensis sp. nov. (type strain, M-5T=DSM 17429T=CGMCC 1.3998T) and Thalassospira profundimaris sp. nov. (type strain, WP0211T=DSM 17430T=CGMCC 1.3997T) are proposed.",2007,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology

Minimax Concave Penalized Multi-Armed Bandit Model with High-Dimensional Convariates,"In this paper, we propose a Minimax Concave Penalized Multi-Armed Bandit (MCP-Bandit) algorithm for a decision-maker facing highdimensional data with latent sparse structure in an online learning and decision-making process. We demonstrate that the MCP-Bandit algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal cumulative regret in the sample size T , O(log T ), and further attains a tighter bound in both the covariates dimension d and the number of significant covariates s, O(s(s + log d)). In addition, we develop a linear approximation method, the 2step Weighted Lasso procedure, to identify the MCP estimator for the MCP-Bandit algorithm under non-i.i.d. samples. Using this procedure, the MCP estimator matches the oracle estimator with high probability. Finally, we present two experiments to benchmark our proposed the MCPBandit algorithm to other bandit algorithms. Both experiments demonstrate that the MCP-Bandit algorithm performs favorably over other benchmark algorithms, especially when there is a high level of data sparsity or when the sample size is not too small.",2018,
Reliability analysis of slopes using UD-based response surface methods combined with LASSO,"Abstract The selection of experimental data points in response surface methods (RSMs) is still not based on precise guidelines or theory, and multicollinearityâ€”defined as the presence of linear correlations among the uncertain variablesâ€”hinders the estimation of the regression coefficients. As a result, a local optimal solution may be obtained. Uniform experimental design (UD) is a quasi Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) method, which has the advantage of coverage of all the experimental points, and is used to analyze the reliability of slopes in this framework. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is a regression method that is employed to estimate the regression coefficients. It involves the penalize the absolute size of the regression coefficients so that the coefficients can be estimated even if the variables are multicollinear. In this paper, a new approach is proposed in which a UD-based RSM is combined with LASSO. The response variable, namely, the factor of safety (Fs), is calculated using a 3D rigorous limit equilibrium method (3D RLEM). Two examples are used to demonstrate the validity and capability of the proposed approach. Notably, the probability of failure (Pf) obtained by the UD-based RSM is larger than that for other reliability methods without multicollinearity. Ignoring the influence of multicollinearity may lead to a nonconservative estimation of slope failure probability.",2018,Engineering Geology
High-Dimensional Function-on-Scale Regression via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers,"In [10] and [16], we proposed tools for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation in a functional linear model with a functional outcome and a large number of scalar predictor. We call these techniques Function-on-Scalar Lasso (FSL) and Adaptive Function-on-Scalar Lasso(AFSL). A scalar group lasso was used to fit the FSL and AFSL estimates. While this approach works well, we improve it by producing custom ADMM methods which are specifically designed for functional data. We propose this new framework as a computational tool for finding FSL estimates. Through our numerical studies, we demonstrate the computational improvement of our methodology.",2016,2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)
Comparative evaluation of support vector machines for computer aided diagnosis of lung cancer in CT based on a multi-dimensional data set,"Lung cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer resulting in over a million deaths per year worldwide. In this paper, the usage of support vector machine (SVM) classification for lung cancer is investigated, presenting a systematic quantitative evaluation against Boosting, Decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, LASSO regressions, neural networks and random forests. A large database of 5984 regions of interest (ROIs) and 488 input features (including textural features, patient characteristics, and morphological features) were used to train the classifiers and evaluate for their performance. The evaluation for classifiers' performance was based on a tenfold cross validation framework, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and Matthews correlation coefficient. Area under curve (AUC) of SVM, Boosting, Decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, LASSO, neural networks, random forests were 0.94, 0.86, 0.73, 0.72, 0.91, 0.92, and 0.85, respectively. It was proved that SVM classification offered significantly increased classification performance compared to the reference methods. This scheme may be used as an auxiliary tool to differentiate between benign and malignant SPNs of CT images in future.",2013,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine
Tillage and cover cropping effects on aggregate-protected carbon in cotton and tomato,"Conservation tillage (CT) and cover cropping (CC) are agricultural practices that may provide solutions to address water and air quality issues arising from intensive agricultural practices. This study investigated how CT and CC affect soil organic matter dynamics in a cotton(Gossypium hirsutum L.)â€“tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) rotation in Californiaâ€™s San Joaquin Valley. There were four treatments: conservation tillage, no cover crop (CTNO); conservation tillage with cover crop (CTCC); standard tillage, no cover crop (STNO); and standard tillage with cover crop (STCC). After 5 yr, the top 30 cm of soil in CTCC had an increase of 4500 kg C ha âˆ’1 , compared with an increase of 3800 kg C ha âˆ’1 in STCC from initial soil C content in 1999. To enhance our understanding of C dynamics in CT systems, we pulse-labeled cotton with 13 CO 2 in the fi eld and followed the decomposition of both the roots and the shoots through three physical fractions: light fraction (LF), which tends to turnover quickly, and two relatively stable C poolsâ€”intraaggregate LF (iLF) and mineral-associated carbon (mC). Soil under CT treatments retained more of the cottonresidue-derived C in LF and iLF than ST 3 mo after placement in the fi eld. These differences disappeared after 1 yr, however, with no discernable differences between CT and ST regardless of CC. In Californiaâ€™s Mediterranean climate, CT alone does not accumulate or stabilize more C than ST in tomatoâ€“cotton rotations, and the addition of cover crop biomass is more important than tillage reduction for total soil C accumulation.

Persistent Herpesvirus and Retrovirus Infections of Dairy Cattle and Bison Malignant Catarrhal Fever: Polymerase Chain Reaction Survey for Ovine Herpesvirus 2 and Other,"Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for sequences of ovine herpesvirus 2 (OHV2), this virus was shown to be significantly associated with sheep-associated malignant catarrhal fever (SA-MCF) in terminal cases of disease in 34 cattle and 53 bison. Ovine herpesvirus 2 was not detected in cattle (38) and bison (10) that succumbed to other diseases. Other persistent herpesviruses, retroviruses, and pestivirus, some of which have been previously isolated from cases of SA-MCF, were not associated with the disease. These included bovine herpesvirus 4 (BHV4), bovine lymphotrophic herpesvirus (BLHV), bovine syncytial virus (BSV, also known as bovine spumavirus), bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). A PCR survey for OHV2 in DNA from individual cowâ€™s peripheral blood lymphocytes in 4 dairies showed that the 1 dairy that was in close contact to sheep had a prevalence of OHV2 of 21.3%, whereas the 3 other dairies had no OHV2. Prevalence of the other herpesviruses and retroviruses in the dairy cows was variable, ranging from 2% to 51% for BHV4, 52% to 78.7% for BLHV, and 10% to 34% for BSV. Bovine lymphotrophic herpesvirus and BSV were also found in a few (1â€“4 of 21 tested) cases of terminal SA-MCF, but BIV and BVDV were not found in either the dairy cows sampled, or in the cases of SA-MCF. No significant correlation was found between the presence of any 2 viruses (OHV2, BHV4, BLHV, BSV) in the dairy cows or terminal cases of SA-MCF. Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is an acute lymphoproliferative disease of cattle, bison, deer, and exotic ruminants.20 This disease is characterized by high fever, corneal opacity, generalized lymphadenopathy, lymphoid vasculitis, and severe inflammatory and degenerative lesions in the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and/or gastrointestinal tract.10,13,14,20,21 Two epidemiologic forms of MCF diseases are recognized: wildebeest-derived MCF (WD-MCF), found in Africa and in zoological parks of North America and Europe, and sheep-associated MCF (SA-MCF), which has been reported worldwide.14,20 The etiologic agent responsible for WD-MCF was identified in 1960 as a cellassociated herpesvirus, classified in the Rhadinovirus genus of the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, and referred to as Alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AHV1).6,14,20 Ovine herpesvirus 2 (OHV2) is considered to be the cause of SA-MCF, but the virus has been refractory to culture. Sequences from a single region of the OHV2 genome with partial sequence homology to AHV1 From the Diagnostic Laboratory (Collins, Vermedahl, Schiebel, Jessen, Schultheiss), and the Departments of Microbiology (Collins), Environmental Health (Bruns), Pathology (Schultheiss, DeMartini), and Clinical Sciences (Anderson, Dinsmore, Callan), College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523. Received for publication October 11, 1999. have been identified and used to establish a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to detect viral DNA.1,2 The PCR test has been successfully applied to detect OHV2 DNA in peripheral blood leukocytes1 and in tissues from terminal cases of SA-MCF in bison24 and cattle.4 Previous investigations of SA-MCF resulted in the detection of a cell-associated cytomegalovirus,30 and retroviruses.12,27 In the present study, cases of SA-MCF in cattle and bison were analyzed retrospectively for OHV2 and for other persistent bovine herpesviruses, retroviruses, and pestivirus. Polymerase chain reaction assays were performed for OHV2, bovine herpesvirus 4 (BHV4), bovine lymphotrophic herpesvirus (BLHV), bovine syncytial virus (BSV, also known as bovine spumavirus), and bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV). In addition, a prospective survey was performed to determine the prevalence of the 3 herpesviruses and 3 retroviruses in cows from dairies with varying history of SA-MCF. Materials and methods Cases of MCF. Fifty-three cases of MCF in bison (25 females, 16 males, 12 unrecorded) were diagnosed on the basis of gross and histopathologic lesions24 over a 10-yr period (1990â€“1999). Forty-two animals received a complete necropsy at the Colorado State University (CSU) Diagnostic 407 Association of OHV2 with SA-MCF Table 1.

Laboratories, 3 were necropsied at the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory, and 2 were necropsied at the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, Amarillo; 6 bison received field necropsies with appropriate tissues submitted by veterinarians. All animals were from bison ranches with the exception of 3 feedlot bison; all ranches experienced multiple losses (from 1% to 95% of bison); ranches were located in Colorado (17), Wyoming (2), and Kansas, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah (1 each). Ages at the time of death were distributed evenly through 7 yr of age; 95% of bison died during November through April. Thirty cases of MCF in cattle (22 cows, 7 steers, 1 bull) were diagnosed from gross and histopathologic lesions13,19 over a 16-yr period (1983â€“1999). Twenty-six animals received a full necropsy at the CSU Diagnostic Laboratory and 4 received field necropsies with tissues forwarded by a veterinarian. All cattle cases were from Colorado dairies (12), feedlots (9), cowâ€“ calf ranches (8), or a bull farm (1); in all but 1 instance, cases were singular. Ages at the time of death were distributed evenly through 6 yr of age, except for yearlings in feedlots; 80% of the cattle died during November through May, but deaths occurred in every month of the year. Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, processed routinely, and sectioned at 5 mm. Sections were either stained with hematoxylin and eosin or extracted for PCR, as described previously.24 Cases of other diseases of cattle and bison. Cases of other terminal diseases in cattle and bison were collected for the purpose of virus surveillance. Thirty-eight bovine cases included 10 pneumonias of various etiology; 3 mucosal disease (bovine viral diarrhea); 3 pulmonary hemorrhage; 2 necrotizing enteritis; 2 emaciation; and 1 each of liver abscess, salmonellosis, suppurative esophagitis, metritis, osteomyelitis, pulmonary vasculitis, uterine prolapse, encephalitis, high mountain disease, dehydration, mastitis, emphysema, myocardial degeneration, pleuritis, hepatic necrosis, and rumenitis. Ten cases in bison included 5 unknown causes of death, esophagitis, emaciation, hepatic lipidosis, encephalitis, and 1 normal bull harvested for meat. Dairies. Four dairies were selected in northeastern Colorado, and blood was collected from approximately 50 random milking cows on each dairy farm. The cows were in different stages of lactation and of variable age, from 2 to 9 yr old. Three of the dairies had a history of MCF disease (dairies 1, 2, and 4), and 1 had no previous history of the disease (dairy 3) (Table 1). Dairy 1 milked 850 cows, lost 4 to 5 cows per year to MCF over the past 5 yr, and was located next to a large sheep feedlot. Dairy 2 milked 470 cows, had no case of MCF in over 5 yr, and had only 1 case of MCF in its history. Sheep were sporadically present in low numbers (20â€“40) less than 1.6 km away. Dairy 3 milked 400 cows, had no recorded cases of MCF in its history, and no sheep were located within 8 km of the farm. Dairy 4 milked 2,000 cows, had no case of MCF in the previous 2 yr, and had only 5 cases in the 3 yr before that. A small herd (40â€“50) of sheep was within 1.6 km of the dairy. Polymerase chain reaction. The DNA was extracted from 200 ml of buffy coat using a commercial kita and suspended in 200 ml of kit buffer. Five microliters (0.01â€“0.05 A260 unit) was used for each PCR, except for the BSV PCR (see below), for which 0.5 ml was used. Each DNA specimen was first confirmed for amplifiabilty (99.4% of DNA preparations) using 0.5 ml and a PCR test for the bovine actin gene.22 The DNA from fixed tissue was extracted as described previously24 using a commercial extraction reagent.b The PCR test for each virus was performed as described (Table 2): OHV2,1,9,24 BLHV,22 BHV4,5 BIV,28 and BSV.26 Positive controls for each PCR were included in every test, as were negative controls (water) every fifth sample. Positive controls consisted of virus or purified DNA as follows: BHV4, strain DN599c; BLHV, plasmid pBLHVd; BIV, plasmid BIVâ€“R29127e; BLV, test kit antigenf; and OHV2 and BSV, buffy coat lymphocyte DNA from field cases. Identity of the OHV2 amplicon was confirmed by sequencing of 4 amplicons from bovine MCF cases and 8 amplicons from bison cases and comparing to GenBank accession HSVOVSEQ.1 One case each of BHV4, BLHV, and BSV infection was confirmed by comparison to sequence data cited in the published reports given above. Tests performed for bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and other ruminant viruses. Virus isolation (VI),3 immunofluorescence (FA),3 and immunoperoxidase (IP)7 tests were conducted for BVDV and other ruminant viruses on 26 of the bison MCF cases and on 24 of the bovine MCF cases. Virus isolation was performed on alimentary tract, lung, and/ or lymphoid tissues from 5 bison and 5 cattle; FA testing for BVDV was performed on multiple tissues including lymphoid tissues from 7 bison and 4 cattle; and IP testing for BVDV was performed on multiple tissues including lymphoid tissues from 15 bison and 15 cattle.

Metabolic Network Construction Using Ensemble Algorithms,"One of the most important and challenging ""knowledge extraction"" tasks in bioinformatics is the reverse engineering of genes, proteins, and metabolites networks from biological data. Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) have been proven to be a very powerful formalism to infer biological networks. Standard GGM selection techniques can unfortunately not be used in the ""small N, large P"" data setting. Various methods to overcome this issue have been developed based on regularized estimation, partial least squares method, and limited-order partial correlation graphs. Several studies compared the performances among several network construction algorithms, such as PLSR, SCE, and ES, ICR and PCR, Ridge regression, Lasso and adaptive Lasso, to see which method is the best for biological network constructions. Each comparison analysis resulted in that each construction method has its own advantages as well as disadvantages according to different circumstances, such as the network complexity. However, it is almost impossible to recognize the complexity of the network before estimation. Thus, we develop an Ensemble method which is model averaging to construct a metabolic network. Our simulation studies show that the ensemble averaging based network construction has F1 score larger than these of other methods except only for Adaptive Lasso, reflecting its ability to account for uncertainty of network complexity.",2015,
Descriptions of eggs of snailfishes (family Liparidae) from the Bering Sea and eastern North Pacific Ocean,"Eggs of liparid fishes were collected by bottom trawl in the southeastern Bering Sea and removed from an oceanographic mooring cable off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. Eggs were large with embryos most commonly in late flexion to postflexion stages. Based on meristic counts and collection localities, eggs were identified as Elassodiscus tremebundus, Paraliparis rosaceus, and Careproctus sp. (either Careproctus colletti or Careproctus melanurus). Eggs of E. tremebundus are oval with a smooth, opaque chorion. Eggs of P. rosaceus are spherical and the chorion is sculptured with a uniformly pebbled texture. Eggs of Careproctus sp. are slightly oval and the chorion is smooth and opaque. Embryos of all species are unpigmented. A pelvic disk is present in embryos of E. tremebundus, but it is rudimentary: a small patch of tissue that was visible only after embryos were cleared and stained. Adults of the genus Paraliparis do not have a pelvic disk and no disk was observed in developing embryos. Embryos of Careproctus sp. have a large disk with rays visible in later stages. Hatching glands are present on the head and nape of embryos of all three species. Hatching glands of E. tremebundus are separated into bands across the snout, along the jaws and opercle, and in a patch on the nape, while those of P. rosaceus and Careproctus sp. are evenly distributed over the head and nape. This is the first full description of the embryonic stages of these taxa.",2013,Ichthyological Research
Obliviousness Makes Poisoning Adversaries Weaker,"Poisoning attacks have emerged as a significant security threat to machine learning (ML) algorithms. It has been demonstrated that adversaries who make small changes to the training set, such as adding specially crafted data points, can hurt the performance of the output model. Most of these attacks require the full knowledge of training data or the underlying data distribution. In this paper we study the power of oblivious adversaries who do not have any information about the training set. We show a separation between oblivious and full-information poisoning adversaries. Specifically, we construct a sparse linear regression problem for which LASSO estimator is robust against oblivious adversaries whose goal is to add a non-relevant features to the model with certain poisoning budget. On the other hand, non-oblivious adversaries, with the same budget, can craft poisoning examples based on the rest of the training data and successfully add non-relevant features to the model.",2020,ArXiv
Early Cretaceous Stratigraphy and Sporopollen Assemblages in the Southern Hailaer Basin,"Abundant sporopollen fossils have been obtained from the dark clastic rocks of the wells of the Beier Depression and Wuerxun Depression, southern Hailaer Basin, Inner Mongolia. Based on the composition and distribution of sporopollen fossils, nine sporopollen assemblages have been established as follows in ascending order: 1. Cycadopites-Abietineaepollenites assembla-ge, from the Longjiang Formation. 2. Cicatricosisporites-Densoisporites-Osmunda-cidites assemblage, the Jiufengshan Formation. 3. Cicatricosisporites-Cyathidites-Appendicispo- rites assemblage, obtained from the Tongbomiao Formation. 4. Piceaepollenites/Pinuspollenites-Abietineaepollenites assemblage, in the first member of the Nantun Formation. 5. Classopollis-Pinuspollenites-Piceaepollenites assemblage, in the second member of the Nantun Formation. 6. Concentrisporites-Perinopollenites-Pinuspollenites assemblage, in the first member of the Damoguaihe Formation. 7. Cyathidites-Concentrisporites-Pinuspollenites assemblage, from the second member of the Damoguaihe Formation. 8. Cicatricosisporites-Cyathidites-Leiotriletes as- semblage, in the first member of the Yimin Formation. 9. Cyathidites-Leiotriletes-Pinuspollenites assemblage, in the second and third member of the Yimin Formation. All of the nine sporopollen assemblages contain pteridophytic spores and gymnospermous pollen grains, few angiospermous pollen grain found. Among the pteridophytic components, most genera of pteridophytic spores bear strong aspect of Early Cretaceous, such as Cicatricosisporites, Pilosisporites, Impardecispora, Hsuispo- rites, Fixisporites, Foraminisporis, Triporoletes, Schizaeoisporites. Only in the second member of the Nantun Formation and Yimin Formation, a few angiospermous pollen grain have been obtained, such as Asteropollis, Clavatipollenites, Tricolpites, Polyporites. It is important in reconstructing the stratigraphic sequence and guiding the exploration of the basin that a lots of sporopollen fossils have been discovered in the Hailaer Basin.",2004,
Sparse Estimation and Uncertainty with Application to Subgroup Analysis,"We introduce a Bayesian method, LASSOplus, that unifies recent contributions in the sparse modeling literatures, while substantially extending pre-existing estimators in terms of both performance and flexibility. Unlike existing Bayesian variable selection methods, LASSOplus both selects and estimates effects while returning estimated confidence intervals for discovered effects. Furthermore, we show how LASSOplus easily extends to modeling repeated observations and permits a simple Bonferroni correction to control coverage on confidence intervals among discovered effects. We situate LASSOplus in the literature on how to estimate subgroup effects, a topic that often leads to a proliferation of estimation parameters. We also offer a simple preprocessing step that draws on recent theoretical work to estimate higher-order effects that can be interpreted independently of their lower-order terms. A simulation study illustrates the methodâ€™s performance relative to several existing variable selection methods. In addition, we apply LASSOplus to an existing study on public support for climate treaties to illustrate the methodâ€™s ability to discover substantive and relevant effects. Software implementing the method is publicly available in the R package sparsereg .",2017,Political Analysis
Explore the Hierarchical Auditory Information Processing Via Deep Convolutional Autoencoder,"Combined with neural encoding models, hierarchical feature representation of sensory information via deep neural network (DNN) has been used to explore the hierarchical organization of sensory cortices. With those advancements, previous studies have revealed a representational gradient in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in auditory information processing, where hierarchical feature representation of auditory stimuli used in fMRI experiments is derived in a supervised manner, that is, the DNN models are trained to classify auditory stimuli. However, feature representation is biased towards discriminative ones in such a supervised DNN and consequently may contaminate brain encoding models. In this study, we propose to derive hierarchical features of auditory stimuli via unsupervised DNN, namely, deep convolutional auto-encoder (DCAE), and develop an encoding model based on LASSO algorithm to explore the relationship between features in multilayers and fMRI brain responses. The results show that auditory cortex is more sensitive to low-level features represented in shallower layers whereas the visual cortex and insula are more sensitive to high-level features represented in deeper layers. These results may provide novel evidence to understand the hierarchical auditory information processing in the human brain.",2019,2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019)
Virtual metrology modeling of time-dependent spectroscopic signals by a fused lasso algorithm,"Abstract This paper proposes a fused lasso model to identify significant features in the spectroscopic signals obtained from a semiconductor manufacturing process, and to construct a reliable virtual metrology (VM) model. Analysis of spectroscopic signals involves combinations of multiple samples collected over time, each with a vast number of highly correlated features. This leads to enormous amounts of data, which is a challenge even for modern-day computers to handle. To simplify such complex spectroscopic signals, dimension reduction is critical. The fused lasso is a regularized regression method that performs automatic variable selection for the predictive modeling of highly correlated datasets such as those of spectroscopic signals. Furthermore, the fused lasso is especially useful for analyzing high-dimensional data in which the features exhibit a natural order, as is the case in spectroscopic signals. In this paper, we conducted an experimental study to demonstrate the usefulness of a fused lasso-based VM model and compared it with other VM models based on the lasso and elastic-net models. The results showed that the VM model constructed with features selected by the fused lasso algorithm yields more accurate and robust predictions than the lasso- and elastic net-based VM models. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to apply a fused lasso to VM modeling.",2016,Journal of Process Control
Correction of Z-deformity of the thumb after trapeziectomy by modified Zancolli Lasso procedure,"Arthritis of the trapeziometacarpal (TM) joint may lead to Z-deformity, which significantly diminishes strength and hinders grasping of large objects. Usually, hyperextension of the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint is not diminished by surgical treatment of TM joint arthritis and additional treatment is needed. A 60-year-old right-handed woman presented with bilateral TM joint arthritis with advanced Z-deformity, swan neck deformity of the long fingers and triggering of the right index finger. Several years earlier, she underwent trapeziectomy and MP joint capsuloplasty (Eaton and Floyd, 1988) on her left thumb with a residual Z-deformity and reduced strength (Figure 1). Preoperatively, we performed five hand dissections in three fresh cadavers to develop the operative procedure and to appreciate the lever arm of a hemi flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) from the index, middle or ring finger at three different exit points (the end of A1 pulley, through the oblique pulley at the middle of the proximal phalanx, and distal to the A2 pulley). A biomechanical study would be needed to precisely assess the moment of force of the FDS according to its position. We carried out a trapeziectomy on the right hand combined with correction of MP joint hyperextension of the thumb and correction of the swan neck deformity of the index in a single procedure. Correction of the Z-deformity was performed after the trapeziectomy through three incisions. A Bruner incision was made over the proximal and middle phalanges of the index finger to expose the tendon sheath. The radial half of the FDS tendon was approached between A3 and A4 pulleys and sectioned at the level of insertion. The radial slip was then detached from the chiasma of the FDS tendon and pulled out through the palmar incision to the level of carpal tunnel. Next, this hemi-FDS was transferred to the thumb following the natural route of the flexor pollicis longus, from the palm to a Bruner incision over the proximal phalanx of the thumb. The tendon was passed underneath the A1 pulley and brought out at the level of the middle of the proximal phalanx through the oblique pulley. The distal end of the tendon was sutured to itself to complete a lasso around the A1 and oblique pulley of the thumb. Tension was set to correct the static deformity and mimic preoperative resting tension of the FDS. The index finger swan neck deformity was corrected by tenodesis of the ulnar portion of the FDS tendon (Littler, 1959). The wrist was splinted at 30 extension with the thumb MP joint in 20 flexion with the interphalangeal joint left free. Mobilization started after 6 weeks under guidance of an occupational therapist and consisted of range of motion and strengthening exercises for 2 months. One year postoperatively, the patient registered a Quick Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score of 25 (63 before surgery) and had no pain nor MP joint hyperextension at rest or during key pinch (Figure 1). The Kapandji score was 10 bilaterally.",2019,Journal of Hand Surgery (European Volume)
Prediction of excitation wavelength of phosphors by using machine learning model,Abstract Luminescent materials are the integral part of green revolution helping us in saving the energy. Much effort been made to design and discover the novel phosphors for solid-state lighting. The current paper focuses on the development of machine learning (ML) model based on simple luminescent materials to predict the excitation to the closest possible accuracy using easily accessible key attributes using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and artificial neural network (ANN) ML approach. These selected attributes expected to correlate with the excitation of material. The style for studying the material property has the potential to turn down the cost and time involved in an Edisonian approach to the lengthy lab experiment to identify excitation.,2019,Journal of Luminescence
Variable Selection for Semiparametric Varying Coefficient Partially Linear Errors-in-Variables (EV) Model with Missing Response,"This paper focuses on the variable selection for semiparametric varying coefficient partially linear model when the covariates are measured with additive errors and the response is missing. An adaptive lasso estimator and the smoothly clipped absolute deviation estimator as a comparison for the parameters are proposed. With the proper selection of regularization parameter, the sampling properties including the consistency of the two procedures and the oracle properties are established. Furthermore, the algorithms and corresponding standard error formulas are discussed. A simulation study is carried out to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.",2015,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
A Two-Graph Guided Multi-task Lasso Approach for eQTL Mapping,"Learning a small number of genetic variants associated with multiple complex genetic traits is of practical importance and remains challenging due to the highdimensional nature of data. In this paper, we proposed a two-graph guided multi-task Lasso to address this issue with an emphasis on estimating subnetwork-to-subnetwork associations in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping. The proposed model can learn such subnetworkto-subnetwork associations and therefore can be seen as a generalization of several state-of-the-art multi-task feature selection methods. Additionally, this model has a nice property of allowing flexible structured sparsity on both feature and label domains. Simulation study shows the improved performance of our model and a human eQTL data set is analyzed to further demonstrate the applications of the model.",2012,
Development of a membrane lipid metabolismâ€“based signature to predict overall survival for personalized medicine in ccRCC patients,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of renal cell carcinoma and is characterized by a dysregulation of changes in cellular metabolism. Altered lipid metabolism contributes to ccRCC progression and malignancy. Associations among survival potential and each gene ontology (GO) term were analyzed by univariate Cox regression. The results revealed that membrane lipid metabolism had the greatest hazard ratio (HR). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to determine the key genes associated with membrane lipid metabolism. Consensus clustering was used to identify novel molecular subtypes based on the key genes. LASSO Cox regression was performed to build a membrane lipid metabolismâ€“based signature. The random forest algorithm was applied to find the most important mutations associated with membrane lipid metabolism. Decision trees and nomograms were constructed to quantify risks for individual patients. Membrane lipid metabolism stratified ccRCC patients into high- and low-risk groups. Key genes were identified by WGCNA. Membrane lipid metabolismâ€“based signatures exhibited higher prediction efficiency than other clinicopathological traits in both whole cohort and subgroup analyses. The random forest algorithm revealed high associations among the membrane lipid metabolismâ€“based signature and BAP1, PBRM1 and VHL mutations. Decision trees and nomograms indicated high efficiency for risk stratification. Our study might contribute to the optimization of risk stratification for survival and personalized management of ccRCC patients.",2019,EPMA Journal
Large-Scale Structured Sparsity via Parallel Fused Lasso on Multiple GPUs,"ABSTRACTWe present a massively parallel algorithm for the fused lasso, powered by a multiple number of graphics processing units (GPUs). Our method is suitable for a class of large-scale sparse regression problems on which a two-dimensional lattice structure among the coefficients is imposed. This structure is important in many statistical applications, including image-based regression in which a set of images are used to locate image regions predictive of a response variable such as human behavior. Such large datasets are increasingly common. In our study, we employ the split Bregman method and the fast Fourier transform, which jointly have a high data-level parallelism that is distinct in a two-dimensional setting. Our multi-GPU parallelization achieves remarkably improved speed. Specifically, we obtained as much as 433 times improved speed over that of the reference CPU implementation. We demonstrate the speed and scalability of the algorithm using several datasets, including 8100 samples of 512 Ã— 512 ...",2017,Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
"Identification, development and testing of thermal error compensation model for a headstock assembly of CNC turning centre","In CNC machine tools, transient temperature variation in the headstock assembly is the major contributors for spindle thermal error. The compensation of thermal error is critical for ensuring the accuracy of machine tool. The performance of an error compensation system depends largely on the accuracy and robustness of the thermal error model. In the present work, a robust thermal error model is developed for minimizing the error in lateral direction of the spindle which significantly influences the geometrical accuracy of the workpiece. Analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) is applied to the results of the experiments in determining the percentage contribution of each individual temperature key point against a stated level of confidence. Based on the analysis of existing approaches for thermal error modeling of machine tools, an approach of LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) is proposed in order to avoid the multi collinearity problem. The proposed method is an innovative variable selection method to remove redundant or unimportant temperature key points in the linear thermal error model and minimize the residual sum of squares. The predictive error model is found to have better robustness and accuracy in comparison to the combination of grey correlation and step wise linear regression for error compensation of CNC lathe.",2014,International journal of engineering and technology
On the prediction loss of the lasso in the partially labeled setting,"In this paper we revisit the risk bounds of the lasso estimator in the context of transductive and semi-supervised learning. In other terms, the setting under consideration is that of regression with random design under partial labeling. The main goal is to obtain user-friendly bounds on the off-sample prediction risk. To this end, the simple setting of bounded response variable and bounded (high-dimensional) covariates is considered. We propose some new adaptations of the lasso to these settings and establish oracle inequalities both in expectation and in deviation. These results provide non-asymptotic upper bounds on the risk that highlight the interplay between the bias due to the mis-specification of the linear model, the bias due to the approximate sparsity and the variance. They also demonstrate that the presence of a large number of unlabeled features may have significant positive impact in the situations where the restricted eigenvalue of the design matrix vanishes or is very small.",2016,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Recounting Memories of Resistance in 33 Days,"Introduction: Wars on the Ground and on the ScreenNew Arab Cinema has been successful in portraying Arab anti-colonial struggles for national self-determination, with numerous films making lasting contributions to visual historical discourse about the Arab region (Khoury, 2005; Shafik, 2007). With respect to the struggle against Israeli military and political hegemony, many films have documented Palestinian history and culture, depicting the plight of Palestinians both in and outside of Israel and/or the Occupied Territories, including refugee camps in neighboring Arab countries. Some documentaries have also investigated the connections between imperialism and Zionism, demanding international recognition for Palestinian statehood (Valassopoulos, 2014).1Lebanon has suffered at least five major offensives by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF); nonetheless, Lebanese filmmakers have been generally unable to ""approach history directly"" (Marks, 2008: 92). Although most Lebanese films deal with the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990) and its aftereffects (Khatib, 2008), all ""condemning it in different ways"" (Khatib, 2011: 134), their rendering of resistance against Israeli forces is by far less pronounced. In filmmaking, there is a ""strong separation of the civil war from the resistance against Israel"" (Richard, 2014: 505). While the civil war is widely (and rightly) deemed absurd, the struggle against Israeli occupation, when depicted, is ""positive"" in both its tonality and memory, for example, in the Al-Manar-produced TV series Al-Ghaliboun (Richard, 2014: 506). Resistance on the screen has revolved around the figure of Souha Bechara- who attempted to assassinate General Antoine Lahad, commander of what was then Israel's proxy South Lebanon Army-and the notorious detention center at Khiam in South Lebanon, for example, in the film Incendies (2010) by Denis Villeneuve, based on Wajdi Mouawad's 2003 play (Launchbury, 2014). A new film, however, has emerged recently. Al Sir el-Madfoun (The Buried Secret; 2015) by Ali Ghafari is a Lebanese-Iranian film about Islamic resistance against Israeli occupation, inspired by the true story of Lebanese Amer Kalakesh, who carried out a suicide mission in Jerusalem in the mid-1980s. It seems surprising that, although numerous documentaries have been made in response to the July-August 2006 Israeli war on Lebanon,2 only two motion pictures have come out about this brutal 34-day episode, namely, the docudrama Taht el-Qasf (Under the Bombs), by Philippe Aractingi, in 2007 and 33 Days, a relatively big-budget LebaneseIranian production3 by Jamal Shoorje, in 2012.Lina Khatib contends that while their civil strife drove the Lebanese apart both literally and politically, its memory-made visible by ""a mixture of reality and fantasy"" in cinematic productions which together constitute ""a memory project giving a voice to a silenced past""-has succeeded in ""bringing them together"" (2008: 178, 179). The 2006 war, I believe, reveals an opposite pattern. While it is true that ""[w]hatever the private feelings about Hizbullah's behaviour, Israel's response created an overwhelming sense of solidarity-a feeling that the Lebanese people, regardless of sect or political persuasion, were in it together"" (Whitaker, 2006: 136), once the dust had settled, the sharp divide between Lebanon's two main political imaginaries was resumed and even sharpened.4 Individual memories of the 2006 war vary widely, so there is little to share publicly and therefore perhaps even less to remember evenly.The Lebanese South has been largely neglected by the Lebanese state and artists alike. Despite having resisted Israeli occupation for 21 years (1978-2000),5 it had remained ironically absent from literary and cultural productions. Back in 1985, novelist Elias Khoury stated that South Lebanon had remained solitary and estranged, ""hurtl[ing] forward, as if it has already accepted for itself a separate fate"" (quoted in Khayyat, 2014: 171). â€¦",2016,Arab Studies Quarterly
Pre-Clinical Investigation of a Low-Intensity Collimated Ultrasound System for Pulmonary VeinÂ Isolation inÂ aÂ PorcineÂ Model.,"OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of pulmonary vein (PV) isolation using low-intensity collimated ultrasound.


BACKGROUND
Contemporary approaches to PV isolation are limited by the technical complexity of mapping and ablation. We describe a novel approach to left atrial anatomic rendering and PV isolation that aims to overcome some of these limitations by using low-intensity collimated ultrasound (LICU) system, which allows for near real-time geometry creation and automated ablation in a porcine model.


METHODS
Twenty swine were anesthetized, and the LICU ablation catheter was placed in the left atrium via percutaneous transseptal access. Ultrasound M-mode-based anatomies of the inferior PVs were successfully created, and ablation was performed under automatic robotic control along a user-defined lesion path. One animal was excluded because of device failure.


RESULTS
All target PVs in the 19 remaining animals were isolated acutely, requiring a mean of 1.6 applications. Ten animals were sacrificed acutely, and the remaining 9 survived for 35 Â± 11 days. Of these 9, 1 animal was excluded from analysis because the index lasso position could not be reliably recreated. PVs in 5 of 8 animals remained isolated at sacrifice. Of the 77 total histological sections, 62 lesions (80.5%) were noted to be transmural. Lesions were homogeneous and characterized by coagulative necrosis and fibrous tissue. The mean myocardial thickness was 2.66 Â± 1.80 mm, and the mean lesion depth was 4.28 Â± 1.97 mm. No extra cardiac or collateral lesions were noted.


CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of a novel noncontact ultrasound mapping and ablation system to produce continuous transmural lesions that can isolate PVs in a porcine model.",2015,JACC. Clinical electrophysiology
Estimation of Graphical Models with Shape Restriction,"Gaussian graphical models are recently used in economics to obtain networks of dependence among agents. A widely-used estimator is the Graphical Lasso (GLASSO), which amounts to a maximum likelihood estimation regularized using the L1,1 matrix norm on the precision matrix Î©. The L1,1 norm is a lasso penalty that controls for sparsity, or the number of zeros in Î©. We propose a new estimator called Structured Graphical Lasso (SGLASSO) that uses the L1,2 mixed norm. The use of the L1,2 penalty controls for the structure of the sparsity in Î©. We show that SGLASSO is asymptotically equivalent to an infeasible GLASSO problem which prioritizes the sparsity-recovery of high-degree nodes. Monte Carlo simulation shows that SGLASSO outperforms GLASSO in terms of estimating the overall precision matrix and in terms of estimating the structure of the graphical model. In an empirical application to a classic firmsâ€™ investment dataset, we obtain a network of firmsâ€™ dependence that exhibits the core-periphery structure, with General Motors, General Electric and U.S. Steel forming the core group of firms.",2017,Social Science Research Network
New stratigraphic and sedimentological investigations on the Middle Eoceneâ€“Early Miocene continental successions in southwestern Sardinia (Italy): Paleogeographic and geodynamic implications,"Abstract In SW Sardinia, the continental Tertiary successions referred up to now to the Cixerri Fm. (Middle Eoceneâ€“Lower Oligocene?) have been investigated. Sedimentological analysis suggests these deposits lied down in fluvial environments and comprised between distal braided streams passing eastward to meandering streams/coastal environments (?) under sub-arid climates. The scrutinization of the Cixerri Fm. westernmost successions allowed one to split locally the upper from the lower part based on sedimentological and mineralogical features and indirect dating. Unfortunately, this separation cannot be set everywhere. The few upper outcrops plainly evidenced and well-constrained have been newly named Flumentepido Fm. and assigned to Late Oligoceneâ€“Early Miocene: they figure out alluvial fans and proximal braided rivers. This way, the SW Sardinia Tertiary continental sedimentation extends its persistence, contemporaneously changing its tectostratigraphic meaning: from a molassoid context related to the Pyrenean wedge dismantling (Eoceneâ€“Oligocene) to a rift-margin succession connected with the opening of the Algero-Provencal back-arc basin due to the Apennine subduction in Oligoceneâ€“Miocene times.",2010,Comptes Rendus Geoscience
'Space alone persistently determines' : the roles and relations of time and space in Kant and Meillassoux,"This thesis addresses the criticism of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant put forward by 
Quentin Meillassoux under the charge of â€˜correlationism.â€™ It uses Meillassouxâ€™s 
interpretation of Kant as a starting point to develop an alternative interpretation in 
which space plays a central role within Kantâ€™s thought, thus contributing to the wider 
philosophy of space. 
The argument progresses through an analysis of the three stages of dogmatism, 
skepticism and Criticism, which are central to Kantâ€™s thought and which Meillassoux 
attempts to circumvent. It demonstrates how Kant develops his Critical philosophy 
through a rejection of dogmatism as a commitment to the principle of sufficient reason, 
which is reconfigured using the insights of Humeâ€™s skepticism. Thus the system 
outlined in the Critique of Pure Reason is at heart a temporal philosophy, in which the 
principle of sufficient reason is reconceptualized in terms of the issue of timedetermination. 
Meillassouxâ€™s alternative system of â€˜speculative materialism,â€™ it is 
argued, proceeds along the same path: Criticizing the principle of sufficient reason and 
reconfiguring it through the insights of Humeâ€™s skeptical problematization of 
induction, in order to assert a temporal philosophy based upon the â€˜hyper-chaosâ€™ of the 
â€˜principle of unreason.â€™ However, with this unexpected parallel between Kant and 
Meillassoux in regard to the issue of time, the problematic role of space also becomes 
apparent. Meillassouxâ€™s temporal philosophy is disrupted by his use of the spatial 
metaphor to fully express the features of time that he sets out, and thus space becomes a point of tension within his temporal system of â€˜speculative materialism.â€™ Working 
back through the parallel between Meillassoux and Kant reveals that the role of space 
and its connection to time is also a problematic point of tension within Kantâ€™s Critical 
philosophy and one that is central to his reworking of the Critique of Pure Reason for 
the 1787 B-Edition. Thus, through a detailed interpretation of the Critical philosophy, 
and especially its role in the Refutation of Idealism added to the B-Edition, the centrality of space within Kantâ€™s system is reasserted and evaluated. This recognition 
of the importance of space and its relation to time within Kantâ€™s system also provides 
the means to reassess Meillassouxâ€™s criticism of Kant as a â€˜correlationistâ€™ and recast 
the debate between idealism and realism in the history of post-Kantian philosophy 
terms of the roles and relations of time and space.",2016,
Persistence and predictors of self-injurious behaviour in autism: a ten-year prospective cohort study,"Self-injurious behaviours, such as head banging, hair pulling, skin picking and scratching, are common in individuals with autism. Despite high prevalence rates, there is a paucity of longitudinal research to refine models of risk and mechanism and inform service planning. In this longitudinal study, we investigated self-injury in a cohort of individuals with autism over 10â€‰years to identify behavioural and demographic characteristics associated with persistent self-injury. Carers of 67 individuals with autism completed questionnaires relating to the presence of self-injury and relevant risk markers at T1 (mean [SD] age in years 13.4 [7.7]) and T3 (mean [SD] age in years 23.9 [7.7]) 10â€‰years later. Forty-six of these also took part at T2 (3â€‰years after initial participation). Analysis assessed demographic and behavioural risk markers for self-injury, as well as the predictive value of items assessed at T1and T2. Self-injury was persistent in 44% of individuals over the 10-year period, with behavioural characteristics of impulsivity (p < .001) and overactivity (p = .002), identified as risk markers for persistence. A predictive model of self-injury was derived from LASSO analysis, with baseline impulsivity, interest and pleasure, stereotyped behaviour, social communication and adaptive functioning predicting self-injury over 10â€‰years. In this unique longitudinal investigation into the persistence of self-injury in a non-clinical sample of individuals with autism over a 10â€‰year period, we have identified a novel, robust and stable profile of behavioural characteristics associated with persistent self-injury. Findings support an early intervention strategy targeted towards individuals identified to be at a higher risk of developing self-injurious behaviour.",2020,Molecular Autism

Variable selection for modeling the absolute magnitude at maximum of Type Ia supernovae,"We discuss what is an appropriate set of explanatory variables in order to predict the absolute magnitude at the maximum of Type Ia supernovae. In order to have a good prediction, the error for future data, which is called the ""generalization error,"" should be small. We use cross-validation in order to control the generalization error and LASSO-type estimator in order to choose the set of variables. This approach can be used even in the case that the number of samples is smaller than the number of candidate variables. We studied the Berkeley supernova database with our approach. Candidates of the explanatory variables include normalized spectral data, variables about lines, and previously proposed flux-ratios, as well as the color and light-curve widths. As a result, we confirmed the past understanding about Type Ia supernova: i) The absolute magnitude at maximum depends on the color and light-curve width. ii) The light-curve width depends on the strength of Si II. Recent studies have suggested to add more variables in order to explain the absolute magnitude. However, our analysis does not support to add any other variables in order to have a better generalization error.",2015,Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan
Bayesian empirical likelihood for ridge and lasso regressions,"Abstract Ridge and lasso regression models, which are also known as regularization methods, are widely used methods in machine learning and inverse problems that introduce additional information to solve ill-posed problems and/or perform feature selection. The ridge and lasso estimates for linear regression parameters can be interpreted as Bayesian posterior estimates when the regression parameters have Normal and independent Laplace (i.e., double-exponential) priors, respectively. A significant challenge in regularization problems is that these approaches assume that data are normally distributed, which makes them not robust to model misspecification. A Bayesian approach for ridge and lasso models based on empirical likelihood is proposed. This method is semiparametric because it combines a nonparametric model and a parametric model. Hence, problems with model misspecification are avoided. Under the Bayesian empirical likelihood approach, the resulting posterior distribution lacks a closed form and has a nonconvex support, which makes the implementation of traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods such as Gibbs sampling and Metropolisâ€“Hastings very challenging. To solve the nonconvex optimization and nonconvergence problems, the tailored Metropolisâ€“Hastings approach is implemented. The asymptotic Bayesian credible intervals are derived.",2020,Comput.

Unveiling microbial life in new deep-sea hypersaline Lake Thetis. Part I: Prokaryotes and environmental settings.,"In September 2008, an expedition of the RV Urania was devoted to exploration of the genomic richness of deep hypersaline anoxic lakes (DHALs) located in the Western part of the Mediterranean Ridge. Approximately 40 nautical miles SE from Urania Lake, the presence of anoxic hypersaline lake, which we named Thetis, was confirmed by swath bathymetry profiling and through immediate sampling casts. The brine surface of the Thetis Lake is located at a depth of 3258 m with a thickness of â‰ˆ 157 m. Brine composition was found to be thalassohaline, saturated by NaCl with a total salinity of 348â€°, which is one of highest value reported for DHALs. Similarly to other Mediterranean DHALs, seawater-brine interface of Thetis represents a steep pycno- and chemocline with gradients of salinity, electron donors and acceptors and posseses a remarkable stratification of prokaryotic communities, observed to be more metabolically active in the upper interface where redox gradient was sharper. [(14) C]-bicarbonate fixation analysis revealed that microbial communities are sustained by sulfur-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophic primary producers that thrive within upper interface. Besides microaerophilic autotrophy, heterotrophic sulfate reduction, methanogenesis and anaerobic methane oxidation are likely the predominant processes driving the ecosystem of Thetis Lake.",2011,Environmental microbiology
Statistical Aspects of High-Dimensional Sparse Artificial Neural Network Models,"An artificial neural network (ANN) is an automatic way of capturing linear and nonlinear correlations, spatial and other structural dependence among features. This machine performs well in many application areas such as classification and prediction from magnetic resonance imaging, spatial data and computer vision tasks. Most commonly used ANNs assume the availability of large training data compared to the dimension of feature vector. However, in modern applications, as mentioned above, the training sample sizes are often low, and may be even lower than the dimension of feature vector. In this paper, we consider a single layer ANN classification model that is suitable for analyzing high-dimensional low sample-size (HDLSS) data. We investigate the theoretical properties of the sparse group lasso regularized neural network and show that under mild conditions, the classification risk converges to the optimal Bayes classifierâ€™s risk (universal consistency). Moreover, we proposed a variation on the regularization term. A few examples in popular research fields are also provided to illustrate the theory and methods.",2020,Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction
SmartGPA: how smartphones can assess and predict academic performance of college students,"Many cognitive, behavioral, and environmental factors impact student learning during college. The SmartGPA study uses passive sensing data and self-reports from students' smartphones to understand individual behavioral differences between high and low performers during a single 10-week term. We propose new methods for better understanding study (e.g., study duration) and social (e.g., partying) behavior of a group of undergraduates. We show that there are a number of important behavioral factors automatically inferred from smartphones that significantly correlate with term and cumulative GPA, including time series analysis of activity, conversational interaction, mobility, class attendance, studying, and partying. We propose a simple model based on linear regression with lasso regularization that can accurately predict cumulative GPA. The predicted GPA strongly correlates with the ground truth from students' transcripts (r = 0:81 and p < 0:001) and predicts GPA within Â±0:179 of the reported grades. Our results open the way for novel interventions to improve academic performance.",2015,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing
Enhancing Accuracy in Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification by using Discounting Factor,"Sentiment Analysis involves in building a system to collect and examine opinions about the product made in blog posts, comments, reviews or tweets. Automatic classification of sentiment is important for applications such as opinion mining, opinion summarization, contextual advertising and market analysis. Sentiment is expressed differently in different domains and it is costly to annotate data for each new domain. In Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification, the features or words that appear in the source domain do not always appear in the target domain. So a classifier trained on one domain might not perform well on a different domain because it fails to learn the sentiment of the unseen words. One solution to this issue is to use a thesaurus which groups different words that express the same sentiment. Hence, feature expansion is required to augment a feature vector with additional related features to reduce the mismatch between features. The proposed method creates a thesaurus that is sensitive to the sentiment of words expressed in different domains. It utilizes both labeled as well as unlabeled data of the source domains and unlabeled data of the target domain. It uses pointwise mutual information to compute relatedness measure which in turn used to create thesaurus. The pointwise mutual information is biased towards infrequent elements/features. So a discounting factor is multiplied to the pointwise mutual information to overcome this problem. Then the proposed method uses the created thesaurus to expand feature vectors. Using these extended vectors, a Lasso Regularized Logistic Regression based binary classifier is trained to classify sentiment of the reviews in target domain. It gives improved prediction accuracy than existing Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification system.",2015,
Serum Alpha-2-Macroglobulin as an intrinsic radioprotective factor in patients undergoing thoracic radiation therapy,"Objective To investigate the impact of alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), a suspected intrinsic radioprotectant, on radiation pneumonitis and esophagitis. Additionally, we establish multifactorial predictive models for pneumonitis and esophagitis. Materials/Methods Baseline A2M levels were obtained for 258 patients prior to thoracic radiotherapy (RT). Dose-volume characteristics were extracted from treatment plans. Spearmanâ€™s correlation (Rs) test was used to correlate A2M levels, smoking status and dosimetric variables with toxicities. Esophagitis and pneumonitis prediction models were built using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression on 1000 bootstrapped datasets. Models were built using 2/3 of the data for training and 1/3 for validation. Results There were 36 (14.0%) patients with grade â‰¥2 pneumonitis and 61 (23.6%) with grade â‰¥2 esophagitis. The median A2M level was 191 mg/dL (range: 94-511). Never/former/current smoker status was 47 (18.2%)/179 (69.4%)/32 (12.4%). We found a significant correlation between baseline A2M levels and esophagitis (Rs=-0.18/p=0.003) and between A2M and smoking status (former or current) (Rs=0.13/p=0.04) but not between A2M and pneumonitis. On univariate analysis, significant parameters for grade â‰¥2 esophagitis included number of fractions (Rs=0.47/p<0.0001), treatment days (Rs=0.44/p<0.0001), chemotherapy use (Rs=0.40/p<0.0001), dose per fraction (Rs=-0.34/p<0.0001), total dose (Rs=0.29/p<0.0001), age (Rs=-0.22/p=0.0003), and several dosimetric variables in esophagus with Rs>0.5 (p<0.0001). For pneumonitis, significant clinical parameters were treatment days (Rs=0.24/p=0.0001), chemotherapy use (Rs=0.22/p=0.0004), number of fractions (Rs=0.21/p=0.0007), dose per fraction (Rs=-0.18/p=0.0035), and total dose (Rs=0.15/p=0.013). The most significant dosimetric variable in lung and heart was D70 (Rs=0.28/p<0.0001) and max dose (Rs=0.27/p<0.0001), respectively. LASSO bootstrap logistic regression models on the validation data resulted in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 and 0.75 for esophagitis and pneumonitis, respectively. Conclusion Our findings show an association of higher A2M values with lower risk of radiation esophagitis and smoking status. Multivariate predictive models also confirmed a role of heart dose in the risk of pneumonitis.",2019,bioRxiv
Use of Sine Shaped High-Frequency Rhythmic Visual Stimuli Patterns for SSVEP Response Analysis and Fatigue Rate Evaluation in Normal Subjects,"Background: Recent EEG-SSVEP signal based BCI studies have used high frequency square pulse visual stimuli to reduce subjective fatigue. However, the effect of total harmonic distortion (THD) has not been considered. Compared to CRT and LCD monitors, LED screen displays high-frequency wave with better refresh rate. In this study, we present high frequency sine wave simple and rhythmic patterns with low THD rate by LED to analyze SSVEP responses and evaluate subjective fatigue in normal subjects. Materials and Methods: We used patterns of 3-sequence high-frequency sine waves (25, 30, and 35 Hz) to design our visual stimuli. Nine stimuli patterns, 3 simple (repetition of each of above 3 frequencies e.g., P25-25-25) and 6 rhythmic (all of the frequencies in 6 different sequences e.g., P25-30-35) were chosen. A hardware setup with low THD rate (<0.1%) was designed to present these patterns on LED. Twenty two normal subjects (aged 23-30 (25 Â± 2.1) yrs) were enrolled. Visual analog scale (VAS) was used for subjective fatigue evaluation after presentation of each stimulus pattern. PSD, CCA, and LASSO methods were employed to analyze SSVEP responses. The data including SSVEP features and fatigue rate for different visual stimuli patterns were statistically evaluated. Results: All 9 visual stimuli patterns elicited SSVEP responses. Overall, obtained accuracy rates were 88.35% for PSD and > 90% for CCA and LASSO (for TWs > 1 s). High frequency rhythmic patterns group with low THD rate showed higher accuracy rate (99.24%) than simple patterns group (98.48%). Repeated measure ANOVA showed significant difference between rhythmic pattern features (P < 0.0005). Overall, there was no significant difference between the VAS of rhythmic [3.85 Â± 2.13] compared to the simple patterns group [3.96 Â± 2.21], (P = 0.63). Rhythmic group had lower within group VAS variation (min = P25-30-35 [2.90 Â± 2.45], max = P35-25-30 [4.81 Â± 2.65]) as well as least individual pattern VAS (P25-30-35). Discussion and Conclusion: Overall, rhythmic and simple pattern groups had higher and similar accuracy rates. Rhythmic stimuli patterns showed insignificantly lower fatigue rate than simple patterns. We conclude that both rhythmic and simple visual high frequency sine wave stimuli require further research for human subject SSVEP-BCI studies.",2018,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience
Weighted LAD-LASSO method for robust parameter estimation and variable selection in regression,"The weighted least absolute deviation (WLAD) regression estimation method and the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) are combined to achieve robust parameter estimation and variable selection in regression simultaneously. Compared with the LAD-LASSO method, the weighted LAD-LASSO (WLAD-LASSO) method will resist to the heavy-tailed errors and outliers in explanatory variables. Properties of the WLAD-LASSO estimators are investigated. A small simulation study and an example are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the WLAD-LASSO method over the LAD-LASSO method in the presence of outliers in the explanatory variables and the heavy-tailed error distribution.",2012,Comput.

"Variation in Total and Extractable Elements with Distance from Roads in an Urban Watershed, Honolulu, Hawaii","Roads play a major role intransporting sediment associated nonpoint sourcepollutants to urban stream networks via storm drains. In urban areas the relationship of erodible soil toroads may be of critical importance in controllingmetal contributions to roads. Two 50-m transects(Park and School) were investigated perpendicular toroads in Manoa basin, Oahu, Hawaii. Concentrations ofnine elements were compared to background control soillocations and to five supplemental samples from nearbyrecreational parks. Sediment from curbside areas ofroads (road deposited sediment) was collected as thestarting point of each transect, and subsequently soilwas sampled from two depths (0â€“2.5 cm and 7.5â€“10.0 cm)along the transects. Total and 0.5 M HCl extractableconcentrations were determined for aluminum (Al),calcium (Ca), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe),manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn)using either inductively coupled plasma-atomicemission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) or flame atomicemission spectroscopy (FAAS). Ca, Cu, Pb and Znexhibited anthropogenic enhancement, with Pb and Znhaving the greatest enrichment in road sedimentfollowed by locations nearest the road. Copperdisplayed a narrower band of contamination than eitherPb or Zn, and this may reflect larger aerosolassociations and more rapid fall velocities. Lead andZn exhibited substantial decay in concentration at 50 m compared to the road sediment, but enrichment wasstill apparent. The positioning of a band of soilbetween the road-curb area and the sidewalk for thePark transect facilitated deposition and storage oftrace metals, and with subsequent erosion by splash orconcentrated flow this area can account for continuedtransport of contaminated sediment to adjacent roadsurfaces. On the other hand the School transect hadno soil directly beside the road, and the nearestsample from the road (5 m) displayed enrichment butsubstantially lower than the Park transect. Thesepreliminary data suggest that remobilization of soilstored metals in close proximity to roads cansignificantly prolong the environmental contaminationof urban road systems and eventually stream sediments.",2001,"Water, Air, and Soil Pollution"

Consistent model identification of varying coefficient quantile regression with BIC tuning parameter selection,"ABSTRACT Quantile regression provides a flexible platform for evaluating covariate effects on different segments of the conditional distribution of response. As the effects of covariates may change with quantile level, contemporaneously examining a spectrum of quantiles is expected to have a better capacity to identify variables with either partial or full effects on the response distribution, as compared to focusing on a single quantile. Under this motivation, we study a general adaptively weighted LASSO penalization strategy in the quantile regression setting, where a continuum of quantile index is considered and coefficients are allowed to vary with quantile index. We establish the oracle properties of the resulting estimator of coefficient function. Furthermore, we formally investigate a Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-type uniform tuning parameter selector and show that it can ensure consistent model selection. Our numerical studies confirm the theoretical findings and illustrate an application of the new variable selection procedure.",2017,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods
"Interior Least Tern and Piping Plover nest and brood survival at managed, off-channel sites along the central Platte River, Nebraska, USA 2001-2015","The Platte River Recovery Implementation Program (PRRIP) and its partners invested substantial resources in creating and managing off-channel nesting habitat for Interior Least Terns (Sternula antillarum athalassos) and Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) along the central Platte River in Nebraska. Among other things, management activities implemented at nesting sites to increase nest and brood survival have included tree removal, construction of a water barrier surrounding the nesting areas, installation of predator fences, and predator trapping. We used 15 years of data at off-channel sites along the central Platte River to assess the influence of several biotic and abiotic variables on the survival of Interior Least Tern and Piping Plover nests and broods. We observed high survival rates for Interior Least Tern and Piping Plover nests and broods as two-thirds of Interior Least Tern and three-quarters of Piping Plover nests were successful and three-quarters of all Interior Least Tern and Piping Plover broods were successful. We found productivity of Interior Least Terns and Piping Plovers was reduced during both the nesting and brood-rearing stages by weatherrelated variables rather than variables the PRRIP can manage. As such, we conclude habitat management activities implemented at off-channel sites to date are sufficient for maintaining high levels of productivity for Interior Least Terns and Piping Plovers along the central Platte River. Survie des nids et des couvÃ©es de la Petite Sterne de l'intÃ©rieur et du Pluvier siffleur sur des sites hors chenal amÃ©nagÃ©s le long de la riviÃ¨re Platte, Nebraska, Ã‰tats-Unis, 2001-2015 RÃ‰SUMÃ‰. Le programme de mise en !uvre du rÃ©tablissement Â« Platte River Recovery Implementation Program Â» (PRRIP) et ses partenaires ont investi des sommes considÃ©rables pour la crÃ©ation et l'amÃ©nagement d'habitat de nidification hors chenal pour les Petites Sternes de l'intÃ©rieur (Sternula antillarum athalassos) et les Pluviers siffleurs (Charadrius melodus) le long de la partie centrale de la riviÃ¨re Platte au Nebraska. Entre autres choses, les activitÃ©s d'amÃ©nagement mises en place sur les lieux de nidification pour augmenter la survie des nids et des couvÃ©es ont consistÃ© au retrait d'arbres, Ã  la construction d'une barriÃ¨re d'eau entourant les secteurs de nidification, Ã  l'installation de clÃ´tures anti-prÃ©dateurs et Ã  au piÃ©geage de prÃ©dateurs. Au moyen de 15 annÃ©es de donnÃ©es rÃ©coltÃ©es sur des sites hors chenal le long de la partie centrale de la riviÃ¨re Platte, nous avons Ã©valuÃ© l'effet de plusieurs variables biotiques et abiotiques sur la survie des nids et des couvÃ©es de Petites Sternes de l'intÃ©rieur et de Pluviers siffleurs. Nous avons observÃ© des taux de survie de nids et de couvÃ©es Ã©levÃ©s pour les deux espÃ¨ces : deux tiers des nids de sternes et trois quarts des nids de pluviers ont eu du succÃ¨s et trois quarts de toutes les couvÃ©es des deux espÃ¨ces ont eu du succÃ¨s. Nous avons dÃ©couvert que la productivitÃ© des deux espÃ¨ces Ã©tait rÃ©duite, Ã  l'Ã©tape de la nidification comme Ã  celle de l'Ã©levage des couvÃ©es, par des variables relatives aux conditions mÃ©tÃ©orologiques plutÃ´t que de variables sur lesquelles pouvait agir le PRRIP. Ainsi, nous concluons que les activitÃ©s d'amÃ©nagement de l'habitat instaurÃ©es jusqu'Ã  maintenant aux sites hors chenal sont suffisantes pour le maintien de hauts taux de productivitÃ© des Petites Sternes de l'intÃ©rieur et des Pluviers siffleurs le long de la riviÃ¨re Platte.",2018,Avian Conservation and Ecology
Total Least-squares for Cognitive Spectrum Sensing,"The present paper develops a collaborative scheme whereby cognitive radios cooperate to localize active primary transmitters and reconstruct the power spectral density (PSD) maps (one per frequency band) portraying the power distribution across space. The sensing scheme relies on a parsimonious linear system model that accounts for the narrow-band nature of transmit-PSDs compared to the large swath of sensed frequencies, and for the group sparsity emerging when adopting a spatial grid of candidate primary user locations. Combining the merits of Lasso, group Lasso, and total least-squares (TLS), the proposed group sparse (GS) TLS approach yields hierarchically-sparse PSD estimates, and copes with model uncertainty induced by channel randomness and grid mismatch effects. Taking advantage of a novel low-complexity solver for the GS-Lasso, a block coordinate descent scheme is developed to solve the formulated GS-TLS problem. Simulations demonstrate the superior localization and PSD-estimation performance of GS-TLS compared to approaches that do not account for model uncertainties.",2011,
Swimming ability and its rapid decrease at settlement in wrasse larvae (Teleostei: Labridae),"Wrasses are abundant reef fishes and the second most speciose marine fish family, yet little is known of their larval swimming abilities. In August 2010 at Moorea, Society Islands, we measured swimming ability (critical speed, Ucrit) of 80 settlement-stage larvae (11â€“17Â mm) of 5 labrid species (Thalassoma quinquevittatum [nÂ =Â 67], Novaculichthys taeniourus [nÂ =Â 6], Coris aygula [nÂ =Â 5], Halichoeres trimaculatus [nÂ =Â 1] and H. hortulanus [nÂ =Â 1]) and 33 new recruits of T. quinquevittatum. Median (mdn) larval Ucrit was 7.6â€“12.5Â cmÂ sâˆ’1. In T. quinquevittatum (nÂ =Â 67), larvae of 12.5â€“14.5Â mm swam faster (mdn 16.9Â cmÂ sâˆ’1) than smaller or larger larvae (mdn 3.9 and 3.2Â cmÂ sâˆ’1, respectively). Labrid larvae Ucrit is similar to that of other similar-sized tropical larvae, so labrids and species with comparable settlement sizes should have similar abilities to influence dispersal. Ucrit of T. quinquevittatum recruits decreased to 47â€“56% of larval Ucrit in 2Â days, implying rapid physiological changes at settlement.",2011,Marine Biology
"Bacterial Communities Associated with Lesions of Shell Disease in the American Lobster, Homarus americanus Milne-Edwards","ABSTRACT Shell disease in Crustacea is a widely recognized syndrome having a polymicrobial etiology, and manifesting itself as lesions of the shell with a variable structure and shell location. We characterized major members of bacterial communities in epizootic shell disease lesions of the American lobster (Homarus americanus, Milne Edwards) and compared these communities with the ones found in study cases of impoundment and enzootic shell disease. Bacteria belonging to several Flavobacteriaceae genera (Aquimarina, Tenacibaculum, Polaribacter, Maribacter, Cellulophaga) within the phylum Bacteroidetes appear to have particular attraction to lobster lesions. The most prominent Bacteroidetes in lobster lesions were representatives of the genus Aquimarina sp., but only Aquimarina â€˜homariaâ€™ was detected in all analyzed lesions of epizootic, impoundment, and enzootic shell disease. It was found on 45% of surfaces unaffected by shell disease, but in smaller numbers compared with lesions. Alphaproteobacteria represent the most diverse class of proteobacteria found in both lesions and on unaffected surfaces. Three bacteria of this class appear to be ubiquitous in shell disease lesions, but only one specific alphaproteobacterium tentatively assigned to the genus Thalassobius (herein designated as â€˜Thalassobiusâ€™ sp.) was present in all analyzed lesions of epizootic, impoundment, and enzootic shell disease. A ubiquitous gammaproteobacterium called â€˜Candidatus Homarophilus dermatusâ€™ was also prevalent in lesions, but just as commonly it was associated with surfaces unaffected by shell disease. The bacteria A. â€˜homariaâ€™ and â€˜Thalassobiusâ€™ sp. are dominant and appear obligatory in lobster shell lesions, and are only occasionally detected on unaffected surfaces, which serve as intermediate reservoirs for the two potential pathogens. Therefore, these two bacteria stand out as potential shell-disease pathogens.",2012,
Marginal Regression For Multitask Learning,"Variable selection is an important and practical problem that arises in analysis of many high-dimensional datasets. Convex optimization procedures that arise from relaxing the NP-hard subset selection procedure, e.g., the Lasso or Dantzig selector, have become the focus of intense theoretical investigations. Although many efficient algorithms exist that solve these problems, finding a solution when the number of variables is large, e.g., several hundreds of thousands in problems arising in genome-wide association analysis, is still computationally challenging. A practical solution for these high-dimensional problems is marginal regression, where the output is regressed on each variable separately. We investigate theoretical properties of marginal regression in a multitask framework. Our contribution include: i) sharp analysis for marginal regression in a single task setting with random design, ii) sufficient conditions for the multitask screening to select the relevant variables, iii) a lower bound on the Hamming distance convergence for multitask variable selection problems. A simulation study further demonstrates the performance of marginal regression.",2012,
Steel-concrete Composite Full Strength Joints with Concrete Filled Tubes . Part Ii : Experimental and Numerical Results,"Both the results of an experimental programme devoted to the evaluation of the cyclic behaviour of composite beam-to-column bolted joints and of thermal analyses conducted by means of ABAQUS 6.4.1 code on a FE model of the joint, in order to obtain internal temperature distribution, are presented and commented upon. A new design approach was followed, in which fire safety and seismic safety were achieved independently moreover fire safety on the structure characterised by stiffness deterioration and strength degradation owing to seismic actions should be guaranteed. Connection specimens, designed in this way, were subjected to cyclic loadings up to collapse, according to the ECCS stepwise increasing amplitude loading history. Experimental results allowed the study of the influence of joint typology and details of the concrete slab (a composite steel-concrete slab with structural profiled steel sheeting and a concrete slab composed of electro-welded lattice girders) on the beam-column sub-assemblage response. The experimental tests, carried out at the Materials and Structural Testing Laboratory of the University of Trento, confirmed the design previsions. Finally, numerical analyses have evidenced a reasonable fire behaviour of composite joints that consequently allow an adequate escape time even in absence of passive and/or active fire protection systems. SOMMARIO Vengono presentati i risultati di una campagna di indagini sperimentali dedicata alla valutazione del comportamento ciclico di giunti bullonati trave-colonna composti e vengono inoltre commentate le analisi termiche effettuate su un modello agli elementi finiti implementato in ABAQUS 6.4.1, per ottenere la distribuzione di temperatura allâ€™interno del giunto. Nella progettazione dei campioni Ã¨ stato seguito un nuovo approccio progettuale secondo cui i giunti, oltre a garantire soddisfacenti prestazioni in presenza di azioni sismiche e del fuoco, 398 F. Ferrario, R. Pucinotti, O.S. Bursi, R. Zandonini devono manifestare un adeguato comportamento al fuoco pur con caratteristiche meccaniche deteriorate dagli effetti delle azioni sismiche. I campioni, cosi progettati, sono stati sottoposti a carico ciclico crescente fino al collasso, secondo le prescrizioni ECCS.

Le prove sperimentali, sono state condotte presso il Laboratorio Prove Materiali e Strutture dell'UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Trento, ed hanno confermato le previsioni progettuali.

Application of burst vibrothermography to characterize planar vertical cracks,"We present a method to characterize vertical cracks in a fast way using burst vibrothermography. In this technique the sample is excited by ultrasounds and, at the defect, rubbing of the contacting surfaces produces heat that can be detected as a temperature rise at the surface using an infrared camera. In this work, first we present the solution of the direct problem, i.e., the calculation of the surface temperature distribution produced by a vertical heat source representing a crack excited by an ultrasound burst, and we choose the information that will be used to characterize the crack, namely, one thermogram and one timing-graph. Next we address the inverse problem, consisting of finding the heat source distribution that is responsible for the observed surface temperature. This inverse problem is ill-posed, and a naÃ¯ve inversion process is unstable. We propose to use three penalty terms, based on zero order Tikhonov and Total Variation functionals and the Lasso method, to stabilize the inversion. By inverting synthetic data, we analyze the performance of the algorithm as a function of the depth of the heat source and we study the effect of the burst duration and noise level in the data on the quality of the reconstructions. Finally, we invert experimental data taken in samples containing calibrated heat sources. The results show that it is possible to characterize vertical cracks down to depths of 6 mm in AISI 304 stainless steel.",2016,
` 1-Penalized Censored Gaussian Graphical Model,"Graphical lasso is one of the most used estimators for inferring genetic networks. Despite its diffusion, there are several fields in applied research where the limits of detection of modern measurement technologies make the use of this estimator theoretically unfounded, even when the assumption of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is satisfied. Typical examples are data generated by polymerase chain reactions and flow cytometer. The combination of censoring and high-dimensionality make inference of the underlying genetic networks from these data very challenging. In this paper we propose an `1penalized Gaussian graphical model for censored data and derive two EM-like algorithms for inference. By an extensive simulation study, we evaluate the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and show that our proposal overcomes existing competitors when censored data are available. We apply the proposed method to gene expression data coming from microfluidic RT-qPCR technology in order to make inference on the regulatory mechanisms of blood development.",2018,
Only subtle cognitive deficits in nonâ€“bulbar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients,"Neuropsychological investigations of amyotrophic sclerosis (ALS) patients revealed considerable discrepancies regarding neurocognitive functions. Some, but not all studies have suggested executive dysfunctioning and memory impairment, and there is a wide range of applied neuropsychological tests and results. In this study, we investigated the neuropsychological performance of 15 nonâ€“bulbar ALS patients, 14 patients with neuromuscular symptoms, and 15 healthy controls. To avoid confounding effects of motor disability, performance was assessed using exclusively motorâ€“free tests of frontal lobe functioning (specific memory functions, conditionalâ€“associative learning, attention, and executive functions). ALS patients exhibited poorer performance in two conditions (semantic and alternating condition, respectively) of the Verbal Fluency Test, suggesting a subtle executive deficit. No deficits were found in tests of memory, conditionalassociative learning, or attention. Assessed mood status was not related to neuropsychological performance.Verbal memory (CVLT) and verbal fluency (lexical condition) were positively associated with duration of disease. Our results support the view that there are only subtle cognitive deficits in ALS patients and we assume a possible effect of practice on cognitive tasks following reduced daily motor activity.",2005,Journal of Neurology
"Esophageal cancer in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso): epidemiological, clinical, endoscopic and anatomopathological aspects","Introduction. Our study aims to strengthen the literature on esophageal cancer in Burkina Faso by assessing its endoscopic frequency and describing its epidemiological, anatomical-clinical and endoscopic characteristics. Patients and Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted from January 1, 2015 to June 30, 2018. Included in this study were all patients who had upper gastrointestinal fibroscopy (UGIF) with biopsy, and in whom esophageal cancer was confirmed histologically. The variables studied were: age, sex, main circumstance of diagnosis, endoscopic appearance, and histological type, as well as risk factors. Results: During the study period, 29 cases of esophageal cancer were diagnosed, with an average endoscopic incidence of 8.3 cases/year. The average age was 58.34 years. There were 17 (58.6%) males, or a sex ratio of 1.5. The definite risk factors of alcohol consumption and active smoking were present in 31.0% of patients. The average duration of consultation was 65.8 days, and the main symptom at diagnosis was dysphagia (72.4%). The preferred location was the lower third for nearly three-quarters of tumors; and the budding form was dominant (56.3%). At histology, squamous cell carcinoma was the dominant type (65.5%). Conclusion: This study shows us an increase in the average annual incidence of esophageal cancer in Bobo-Dioulasso. It mainly affects males from the age of 50, with clinical, endoscopic and histological characteristics similar to those found in the literature. The great delay in diagnosis limits the therapeutic options for this cancer with a formidable prognosis.",2019,
The Effects of Variable Selection Methods on Linear Regression-Based Effort Estimation Models,"Stepwise regression has often been used for variable selection of effort estimation models. However it has been criticized for inappropriate selection, and another method is recommended. We thus examined the effects of Lasso, which is one of such variable selection methods. An experiment with datasets from PROMISE repository revealed that Lasso-based selection stably selected better variables than stepwise in predictive performance. We thus concluded Lasso-based selection is preferable to stepwise regression.",2013,2013 Joint Conference of the 23rd International Workshop on Software Measurement and the 8th International Conference on Software Process and Product Measurement
"Understanding and Predicting Travel Time with Spatio-Temporal Features of Network Traffic Flow, Weather and Incidents","Travel time on a route varies substantially by time of day and from day to day. It is critical to understand to what extent this variation is correlated with various factors, such as weather, incidents, events or travel demand level in the context of dynamic networks. This helps a better decision making for infrastructure planning and real-time traffic operation. We propose a data-driven approach to understand and predict highway travel time using spatio-temporal features of those factors, all of which are acquired from multiple data sources. The prediction model holistically selects the most related features from a highdimensional feature space by correlation analysis, principle component analysis and LASSO. We test and compare the performance of several regression models in predicting travel time 30 min in advance via two case studies: (1) a 6-mile highway corridor of I-270N in D.C. region, and (2) a 2.3-mile corridor of I-376E in Pittsburgh region. We found that some bottlenecks scattered in the network can imply congestion on those corridors at least 30 minutes in advance, including those on the alternative route to the corridors of study. In addition, real-time travel time is statistically related to incidents on some specific locations, morning/afternoon travel demand, visibility, precipitation, wind speed/gust and the weather type. All those spatiotemporal information together help improve prediction accuracy, comparing to using only speed data. In both case studies, random forest shows the most promise, reaching a root-mean-squared error of 16.6% and 17.0% respectively in afternoon peak hours for the entire year of 2014.",2019,IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine
Put a Bow on It: Knotted Antibiotics Take Center Stage,"Ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a large class of natural products produced across all domains of life. The lasso peptides, a subclass of RiPPs with a lasso-like structure, are structurally and functionally unique compared to other known peptide antibiotics in that the linear peptide is literally ""tied in a knot"" during its post-translational maturation. This underexplored class of peptides brings chemical diversity and unique modes of action to the antibiotic space. To date, eight different lasso peptides have been shown to target three known molecular machines: RNA polymerase, the lipid II precursor in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and the ClpC1 subunit of the Clp protease involved in protein homeostasis. Here, we discuss the current knowledge on lasso peptide biosynthesis as well as their antibiotic activity, molecular targets, and mechanisms of action.",2019,Antibiotics
Bayesian semi-parametric multiple shrinkage,"High dimensional and highly correlated data leading to nonor weakly-identified effects are commonplace. Maximum likelihood will typically fail in such situations and a variety of shrinkage methods have been proposed. Standard techniques, such as ridge regression or the lasso, shrink estimates toward zero, with some approaches allowing coefficients to be selected out of the model by achieving a value of zero. When substantive information is available, estimates can be shrunk to non-null values; however, such information may not be available. We propose a Bayesian semi-parametric approach that allows shrinkage to multiple locations. Coefficients are given a mixture of heavy tailed double exponential priors, with location and scale parameters assigned Dirichlet process hyperpriors to allow groups of coefficients to be shrunk toward the same, possibly non-zero, mean. Our approach favors sparse, but flexible structure, by shrinking towards a small number of random locations. The methods are illustrated using a study of genetic polymorphisms and multiple myeloma.",2007,
Factor structure of the WISCâ€V in four standardization age groups: Exploratory and hierarchical factor analyses with the 16 primary and secondary subtests,"1Eastern Illinois University 2RiderUniversity 3BaylorUniversity Correspondence GaryL.Canivez, Ph.D., Professorof Psychology, Eastern IllinoisUniversity, DepartmentofPsychology, 600LincolnAvenue, Charleston, IL61920â€“3099. Email: glcanivez@eiu.edu Preliminary resultswerepresentedat the2015 AnnualConventionof theAmericanPsychologicalAssociation, Toronto,Ontario,Canada. Abstract This study examined the factor structure of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (WISC-V) with four standardization sample age groups (6â€“8, 9â€“11, 12â€“14, 15â€“16 years) using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), multiple factor extraction criteria, and hierarchical EFA not included in the WISC-V Technical and Interpretation Manual. Factor extraction criteria suggested that one to four factors might be sufficient despite the publisher-promoted, five-factor solution. Forced extraction of five factors resulted in only one WISC-V subtest obtaining a salient pattern coefficient on the fifth factor in all four groups, rendering it inadequate. Evidence did not support the publisher's desire to split Perceptual Reasoning into separateVisual Spatial and FluidReasoning dimensions. Results indicated that mostWISC-V subtests were properly associated with the four theoretically oriented first-order factors resembling theWISCIV, the g factor accounted for large portions of total and common variance, and the four first-order group factors accounted for small portions of total and common variance. Results were consistentwith EFA of theWISC-V total standardization sample.",2018,Psychology in the Schools
Financial Fraud Detection Through Artificial Intelligence,"The present work shows the analysis and modeling of a database with information about the various credit card transactions. The objective is to detect transactions that are fraudulent. In the modeling process, the â€œRidge and Lassoâ€, â€œBoostingâ€ and â€œRandom Forestâ€ techniques were applied in the modeling and variables selection. The results show that the accuracy of the models was very high, so the metric â€œRecallâ€ was chosen as a second criterion for selecting the best model. This metric measures the percentage of positive values of the variable â€œfraudâ€. It is concluded that the best model is that of â€œBoostingâ€ with 1,500 trees and a K-Folds of 10 that presented the best results in both training and validation.",2019,
Penalized Lasso Methods in Health Data: application to trauma and influenza data of Kerman,"Background: Two main issues that challenge model building are number of Events Per Variable and multicollinearity among exploratory variables. Our aim is to review statistical methods that tackle these issues with emphasize on penalized Lasso regression model. Â The present study aimed to explain problems of traditional regressions due to small sample size and multi-colinearity in trauma and influenza data and to introduce Lasso regression as the most modern shrinkage method. Methods: Two data sets, corresponded to Events Per Variable of 1.5 and 3.4, were used. The outcomes of these two data sets were hospitalization due to trauma and hospitalization of patients suffering influenza respectively. In total, four models were developed: classic Cox and logistic regression models, as well as their penalized lasso form. The tuning parameters were selected through 10-fold cross validation. Results: Traditional Cox model was not able to detect significance of any of variables. Lasso Cox model revealed significance of respiratory rate, focused assessment with sonography in trauma, difference between blood sugar on admission and 3Â h after admission, and international normalized ratio. In the second data set, while lasso logistic selected four variables as being significant, classic logistic was able to identify only the importance of one variable. Conclusion: The AIC for lasso models was lower than that for traditional regression models. Lasso method has practical appeal when Events Per Variable is low and multicollinearity exists in the data.",2019,
DetecÃ§Ã£o e identificaÃ§Ã£o molecular de vÃ­rus associados a videiras sintomÃ¡ticas e,"The vegetative propagation of grapevine facilitates multiple viral infections, with different symptoms which vary according to combinations of cultivar or host species with viral species. The aims of this research were to detect and identify the viral species infecting two grapevine species/cultivars: one symptomatic and one symptomless. DsRNA from both samples was assayed by RT-PCR using 17 pairs of specific primers for detection of the Grapevine virus A (GVA), Grapevine virus B (GVB), Grapevine virus D (GVD), Grapevine fleck virus (GFkV), Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV), Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), Grapevine chrome mosaic virus (GCMV), Rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (RSPaV) and Grapevine leafrollassociated virus 1-4 (GLRaV-1 to -4), besides three degenerate primer pairs. For each primer pair at least one amplicon was cloned and sequenced. Symtomatic and symptomless plants were multiple infected by RSPaV, GLRaV-2 and/or GLRaV-3. The nucleotide sequences of seven isolates of RSPaV, three of GLRaV-2 and two of GLRaV-3 showed identities higher than 90% with the homologous viral species and allowed to identify possible viral strains in infected samples. These results highlight the necessity of viral diagnosis based on specific assays to determine grapevine sanitary status.",2010,
Efficient support recovery via weighted maximum-contrast subagging,"In this paper, we study finite sample properties of subagging for nonsmooth estimation and model selection in sparse and large-scale regression settings where both the number of parameters and the number of samples can be extremely large. This setup is very different from high-dimensional regression and is such that Lasso estimator might be inappropriate for computational, rather than statistical reasons. We show that subagging of Lasso estimators results in discontinuous estimated support set and is never able to recover sparsity set when at least one of aggregated estimators has probability of support recovery strictly less than 1. Therefore, we propose its randomized and smoothed alternative, which we call weighted maximum-contrast subagging. We develop theory in support of the claim that proposed method has tight error control over both false positives and false negatives, regardless of the size of a dataset. Unlike existing methods, it allows for oracle-like properties, even in cases of non-oracle-like properties of aggregated estimators. Furthermore, we design an adaptive procedure for selecting tuning parameters and appropriate optimal weighting scheme. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive simulation study and analysis of a part of the million-song-challenge dataset.",2013,
Nicolai Hartmann and Recent Realisms,"Some contemporary philosophers have called for a â€œnew realismâ€ in philosophical ontology.

Iâ€™ll also describe and comment on Hartmannâ€™s arguments concerning the â€œthing in itself,â€ which he considers a key â€œcriticalâ€ concept of his new ontology. His treatment of this issue demonstrates the sophisticationâ€”and, perhaps, superiorityâ€”of Hartmannâ€™s approach.",2017,Axiomathes
Topologically inferring pathway activity for precise survival outcome prediction: breast cancer as a case.,"Accurately predicting the survival outcome of patients is of great importance in clinical cancer research. In the past decade, building survival prediction models based on gene expression data has received increasing interest. However, the existing methods are mainly based on individual gene signatures, which are known to have limited prediction accuracy on independent datasets and unclear biological relevance. Here, we propose a novel pathway-based survival prediction method called DRWPSurv in order to accurately predict survival outcome. DRWPSurv integrates gene expression profiles and prior gene interaction information to topologically infer survival associated pathway activities, and uses the pathway activities as features to construct Lasso-Cox model. It uses topological importance of genes evaluated by directed random walk to enhance the robustness of pathway activities and thereby improve the predictive performance. We applied DRWPSurv on three independent breast cancer datasets and compared the predictive performance with a traditional gene-based method and four pathway-based methods. Results showed that pathway-based methods obtained comparable or better predictive performance than the gene-based method, whereas DRWPSurv could predict survival outcome with better accuracy and robustness among the pathway-based methods. In addition, the risk pathways identified by DRWPSurv provide biologically informative models for breast cancer prognosis and treatment.",2017,Molecular bioSystems
Locomotor activity rhythm in four wrasse species under varying light conditions,"Under controlled laboratory conditions, the locomotor activity rhythms of four species of wrasses (Suezichthys gracilis, Thalassoma cupido, Labroides dimidiatus andCirrhilabrus temminckii) were individually examined using an actograph with infra-red photo-electric switches in a dark room at temperatures of 21.3â€“24.3Â°C, for 7 to 14 days. The locomotor activity ofS. gracilis occurred mostly during the light period under a light-dark cycle regimen (LD 12:12; 06:00-18:00 light, 18:00-06:00 dark). The locomotor activity commenced at the beginning of the light period and continued until a little before the beginning of dark period. The diel activity rhythm of this species synchronizes with LD. Under constant illumination (LL) this species shows distinct free-running activity rhythms varying in length from 23 hrs. 39 min. to 23 hrs. 47 min. Therefore,S. gracilis appears to have a circadian rhythm under LL. However, in constant darkness (DD), the activity of this species was greatly suppressed. All the fish showed no activity rhythms in DD conditions. After DD, the fish showed the diel activity rhythm with the resumption of LD, but this activity began shortly after the beginning of light period. The fish required several days to synchronize with the activity in the light period. Therefore,S. gracilis appeared to continue the circadian rhythm under DD. InT. cupido, the locomotor activity commenced somewhat earlier than the beginning of the light period and continued until the beginning of the dark period under LD. The diel activity rhythm of this species synchronizes with LD. Under LL, four of the five specimens of this species tested showed free-running activity rhythms for the first 5 days or longer varying in length from 22 hrs. 54 min. to 23 hrs. 39 min. Although the activity of this species was suppressed under DD, two of five fish showed free-running activity rhythms throughout the experimental period. The lengths of such free-running periods were from 23 hrs. 38 min. to 23 hrs. 50 min. under DD. Therefore, it was ascertained thatT. cupido has a circadian rhythm. InL. dimidiatus, the locomotor activity rhythm under LD resembled that observed inT. cupido. The diel activity rhythm of this species synchronizes with LD. Under LL, four of seven of this species showed free-running activity rhythms throughout the experimental period. The lengths of such free-running periods were from 23 hrs. 07 min. to 25 hrs. 48 min. Although the activity of this species was suppressed under DD, three of five fish showed free-running activity rhythms throughout the experimental period. The lengths of such free-running periods were from 23 hrs. 36 min. to 23 hrs. 41 min. under DD. Therefore, it was ascertained thatL. dimidiatus has a circadian rhythm. Almost all locomotor activity of C.temminckii occurred during the light period under LD. The diel activity rhythm of this species coincides with LD. Under LL, two of four of this species showed free-running activity rhythms throughout the experimental period. The lengths of such free-running periods were from 23 hrs. 32 min. to 23 hrs. 45 min. Although the activity of this species was suppressed under DD, one of the four fish showed free-running activity rhythms throughout the experimental period. The length of the free-running period was 23 hrs. 21 min. under DD. Therefore,C. temminckii appeared to have a circadian rhythm. According to field observations,S. gracilis burrows and lies in the sandy bottom whileT. cupido, L. dimidiatus, andC. temminckii hide and rest in spaces among piles of boulders or in crevices of rocks during the night. It seems that the differences in nocturnal behavior among the four species of wrasses mentioned above are closely related to the intensity of endogenous factors in their locomotor activity rhythms.",1990,Japanese Journal of Ichthyology
Nipple drinkers for brooding commercial Large White turkeys.,"4 Abstract: The objective of this research was to determine the effect of using nipple drinkers during brooding on the performance of Large White turkeys. There were 6 different drinkers tested: the control and 5 nipple drinker systems. The control was the Plasson Drinker and the nipple systems tested were the Plasson Easy Start (PES), Val-Co Turkey Drinker (VC), Lubing Traditional Nipple (LTN), Lubing EasyLine (LEL) and Ziggity TM Big-Z Activator (BZ). Three experiments were conducted with turkeys brooded using the 6 drinker types. Some nipple drinker treatments were used in the rearing periods. At 20 wk, Body Weight (BW) was reduced for toms brooded to 6 wk on the LTN and brooded and reared on the VC. The use of LEL and LTN (during brooding) resulted in improved Feed Conversion (FC) at 20 wk. Trial 2-experiment 1 with hens of two strains was terminated at 3 wk because of excessive mortality from dehydration with some drinker types. In trial 2 -experiment 2, there were no poult hydration issues. The BW of hens at 6 wk brooded on the Plasson Drinker and the VC were higher compared to the BW of hens brooded on the PES and the BZ with the BW of hens on the LEL being intermediate. The use of the LTN resulted in significantly lower hen BW compared with all other drinkers through 10 wk. By 16 wk, there were no longer differences in hen BW due to drinker type. Drinker type did not have an effect on hen FC. Nipple drinkers can be used effectively to brood turkeys with some types also being useful during the rearing period. However, poor quality, inactive, or diseased poults may be at risk for dehydration on some nipple drinker systems.",2009,International Journal of Poultry Science
"ELASTICREGRESS: Stata module to perform elastic net regression, lasso regression, ridge regression","elasticregress calculates an elastic net-regularized regression: an estimator of a linear model in which larger parameters are discouraged.

The algorithm used is the 'covariance updates' algorithm presented in Section 2 of that paper, except that it does not exploit sparsity in the covariates.",2017,Statistical Software Components
Cost-effectiveness of Spa treatment for fibromyalgia: general health improvement is not for free.,"OBJECTIVES
To estimate the cost-effectiveness of an adjuvant treatment course of spa treatment compared with usual care only in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FM).


METHODS
134 patients with FM, selected from a rheumatology outpatient department and from members of the Dutch FM patient association were randomly assigned to a 2(1/2) week spa treatment course in Tunisia or to usual care only. Results are expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for a 6-month as well as a 12-month time horizon. Utilities were derived form the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) scores and the visual analogue scale (VAS) rating general health. Costs were reported from societal perspective. Mean incremental cost per patient and the incremental cost utility ratio (ICER) were calculated; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using double-sided bootstrapping.


RESULTS
The data of 128 (55 spa and 73 controls) of the 134 patients (96%) could be used for analysis. Improvement in general health was found in the spa group until 6 months of follow-up by both the SF-6D (AUC 0.32 vs 0.30, P < 0.05) and the VAS (AUC 0.23 vs 0.19, P < 0.01). After 1yr no significant between-group differences were found. Mean incremental cost of spa treatment was 1311 Euro per patient (95% CI 369-2439), equalling the cost of the intervention (thalassotherapy including airfare and lodging), or 885 Euro per patient based on a more realistic cost estimate.


CONCLUSIONS
The temporary improvement in quality of life due to an adjuvant treatment course of spa therapy for patients with FM is associated with limited incremental costs per patient.",2007,Rheumatology
"Towards a ""militarization rush"" in the Arctic region? Evidences, recent trends and critical issues in the case of the Russian Arctic","EnglishThis paper considers the most important elements concerning security and militarization in the Russian Arctic. Moscow is today re-opening and modernizing important military bases. This fact can support the idea that, from the Russian side, a new phase in the ""militarization rush"" is in progress. However, the militarization process is above all related to the need for Russia to patrol and protect about 23,000 km of borders, which are becoming more and more vulnerable in terms of national security, due to the process of ice melting. Moreover, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russia navy and air force experienced a long period of decline; from this perspective, Russia's Government must invest in the military sector to maintain its position as superpower, in a strategic and global perspective. There are some important reasons that suggest that Russia is not interested, and does not have the capability to militarize further the Arctic: economic development requires stability; international relations in the Arctic has a long record of cooperation; ideology, that played a basic role during the Cold War is today less important; militarization is very costly and not sustainable; other security issues are emerging. It is the redefinition of security that makes the classical concept of militarization rather obsolete and not suitable to deal with the new Arctic security challenges. francaisVers la ""course a la militarisation"" dans la region Arctique? Evidences, tendances recentes et aspects critiques dans le cas de l'Arctique russe. - Moscou est actuellement en train de reouvrir et de moderniser certaines bases militaires dans la region Arctique. Cet element pourrait appuyer l'idee qu'une course au rearmement soit en cours, du cote russe, aussi dans une prospective de conflit entre protagonistes a l'echelle regionale, pour l'exploitation de ses ressources par exemple. En effet, le processus de militarisation semble etre lie d'un cote au fait que la fonte des glaces marines contraint la Russie a proteger 23.000 kilometres de frontieres cotieres au nord; et de 'autre, au processus de modernisation du complexe militaire russe d'un point de vue strategique et global, apres vingt ans de coupes budgetaire aux depenses militaires suite a l'effondrement de l'URSS. De plus, plusieurs raisons suggerent que la Russie n'est pas interessee et n'a pas non plus les capacites de militariser l'Arctique dans le futur: seule la stabilite internationale peut favoriser le developpement economique de l'Arctique russe; les relations internationales sont aujourd'hui favorables a la cooperation entre les pays de l'Arctique. Il faut aussi prendre en compte le fait que la Russie n'a pas les ressources pour militariser la region, et enfin le debat sur les changements climatiques etend le concept de securite, rendant la strategie de militarisation obsolete. italianoVerso la ""corsa alla militarizzazione"" nella regione artica? Evidenze, recenti tendenze e aspetti 419 critici nel caso dell'Artico russo. - L'articolo considera i principali temi relativi a sicurezza e militarizzazione che coinvolgono l'Artico russo. Mosca sta attualmente riaprendo e modernizzando alcune importanti basi militari. Questo elemento puo sostenere l'idea che sia in atto, da parte russa, una corsa al riarmo, anche in una prospettiva di confronto tra attori alla scala regionale, ad esempio per lo sfruttamento delle sue risorse. In realta il processo di militarizzazione e legato da un lato al fatto che con lo scioglimento del ghiaccio marino la Russia si ritrovera a dover proteggere ben 23.000 chilometri di confine costiero nel nord; dall'altro, al processo di ammodernamento del complesso militare russo in chiave strategica e globale, dopo un ventennio di tagli alle spese militari e di declino del settore legato al collasso sovietico. Inoltre, diversi motivi suggeriscono che la Russia non sia interessata ne abbia le capacita per militarizzare ulteriormente l'Artico: lo sviluppo economico richiede stabilita; la cooperazione tra paesi artici e consolidata; l'area non e piu lo scenario di un scontro ideologico; l'economia russa e in crisi; il cambiamento climatico e le questioni di sicurezza ambientale rendono piu complesso il concetto di sicurezza. E proprio la ridefinizione del tema della sicurezza che rende il concetto classico di militarizzazione alquanto obsoleto e non in grado di rispondere alle nuove sfide della sicurezza Artica.",2018,
Behavioural Overlap in Six Caribbean Labrid Species: Intra- and Interspecific Similarities,"This study investigates behavioural similarities in six ecologically and morphologically similar labrid species. Ontogenetic shifts in behaviour within species are also considered. There have been many studies on ontogenetic differences in fishes with respect to diet, microhabitat use, and visual acuity and how it pertains to foraging ability; however, fewer studies have been specifically directed towards the ontogeny of behaviours. In this study, detailed behavioural observations were recorded of randomly chosen juveniles, initial phase, and terminal phase adults from each of the following species: Halichoeres bivittatus, H. garnoti, H. maculipinna, H. poeyi, and Thalassoma bifasciatum. Only juvenile H. radiatus were observed. The observation periods lasted 10â€‰min, and four periods per individual were pooled for analysis. There were many similarities and few striking differences in the behavioural profiles of the six species [discriminant function analysis (DFA) of behaviours correctly classified 60% of the individuals]. In some cases, life intervals within a species separated more strongly than heterospecifics of the same life interval. For example, H. bivittatus juveniles were more similar to H. maculipinna juveniles than to conspecific initial phase and terminal phase adults. From DFA, species were separated in the first discriminant function by an inverse relationship between the frequency of â€˜hidingâ€™ (= out of view) and eating, and life intervals were separated in the second discriminant function by an inverse relationship between the frequency of swimming alone and â€˜eye flickeringâ€™ (= remaining motionless and twitching their eyes). Eye flickering is assumed to be a behaviour that increases an individual's awareness of predators or environmental threats. Notable differences among species included the greater frequencies of hiding by juvenile H. radiatus, and all life intervals of H. garnoti. As these labrids grow, they increase their frequencies of swimming alone, and decrease their frequencies of hovering and searching for food. There was a remarkable similarity in ontogenetic changes in these behaviours for all of the species studied.",2004,Environmental Biology of Fishes
Robust Controller Synthesis in Timed Automata,"We consider the fundamental problem of Buchi acceptance in timed automata in a robust setting. The problem is formalised in terms of controller synthesis: timed automata are equipped with a parametrised game-based semantics that models the possible perturbations of the decisions taken by the controller. We characterise timed automata that are robustly controllable for some parameter, with a simple graph theoretic condition, by showing the equivalence with the existence of an aperiodic lasso that satisfies the winning condition (aperiodicity was defined and used earlier in different contexts to characterise convergence phenomena in timed automata). We then show decidability and PSPACE-completeness of our problem.",2013,
Nomograms for predicting the overall and cause-specific survival in patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor: a population-based study,"BackgroundMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is extremely rare in soft tissue sarcoma, with a high rate of recurrence and metastasis. Due to its rarity, the epidemiological features and prognostic factors are still uncertain. Moreover, nomograms for patients with MPNST have not been constructed and validated until now.Patients and methodsPatients diagnosed with MPNST between 1973 and 2014 were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Survival analysis, machine learning and Lasso regression were used to identify the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS). Significant prognostic factors were integrated to construct nomograms and then the nomograms were validated externally with a separate cohort from our own institution.ResultsA total of 689 patients were included in the training set and 42 patients in the validation set. Multivariate analysis suggested that age, histology, historic stage and chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for OS and primary site, surgery, historic stage and chemotherapy for CSS. The nomograms based on multivariate models were developed and validated for predicting 3- and 5-year OS and CSS, with a C-index of 0.686 and 0.707, respectively. In the external validation set, the C-index was 0.700 for OS and 0.722 for CSS.ConclusionICD-O-3 histology, historic stage and chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for OS and primary site, surgery, historic stage and chemotherapy for CSS. The constructed nomograms could provide individual prediction for MPNST patients and assist oncologists in making accurate survival evaluation.",2019,Journal of Neuro-Oncology
Redundancy Techniques for Straggler Mitigation in Distributed Optimization and Learning,"Performance of distributed optimization and learning systems is bottlenecked by ""straggler"" nodes and slow communication links, which significantly delay computation. We propose a distributed optimization framework where the dataset is ""encoded"" to have an over-complete representation with built-in redundancy, and the straggling nodes in the system are dynamically left out of the computation at every iteration, whose loss is compensated by the embedded redundancy. We show that oblivious application of several popular optimization algorithms on encoded data, including gradient descent, L-BFGS, proximal gradient under data parallelism, and coordinate descent under model parallelism, converge to either approximate or exact solutions of the original problem when stragglers are treated as erasures. These convergence results are deterministic, i.e., they establish sample path convergence for arbitrary sequences of delay patterns or distributions on the nodes, and are independent of the tail behavior of the delay distribution. We demonstrate that equiangular tight frames have desirable properties as encoding matrices, and propose efficient mechanisms for encoding large-scale data. We implement the proposed technique on Amazon EC2 clusters, and demonstrate its performance over several learning problems, including matrix factorization, LASSO, ridge regression and logistic regression, and compare the proposed method with uncoded, asynchronous, and data replication strategies.",2019,J.

We have developed fastBMA, a distributed, parallel, and scalable implementation of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) for this purpose. fastBMA also includes a computationally efficient module for eliminating redundant indirect edges in the network by mapping the transitive reduction to an easily solved shortest-path problem. We evaluated the performance of fastBMA on synthetic data and experimental genome-wide time series yeast and human datasets. When using a single CPU core, fastBMA is up to 100 times faster than the next fastest method, LASSO, with increased accuracy. It is a memory-efficient, parallel, and distributed application that scales to human genome-wide expression data. A 10Â 000-gene regulation network can be obtained in a matter of hours using a 32-core cloud cluster (2 nodes of 16 cores). fastBMA is a significant improvement over its predecessor ScanBMA. It is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster than other fast network inference methods such as the 1 based on LASSO. The improved scalability allows it to calculate networks from genome scale data in a reasonable time frame. The transitive reduction method can improve accuracy in denser networks. fastBMA is available as code (M.I.T. license) from GitHub (https://github.com/lhhunghimself/fastBMA), as part of the updated networkBMA Bioconductor package (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/networkBMA.html) and as ready-to-deploy Docker images (https://hub.docker.com/r/biodepot/fastbma/).",2017,GigaScience

"Population Density, Growth, and Fecundity of the Creek Chubsucker, Erimyzon oblongus","soma's spectacle is primary or secondary. Elassoma has been regarded as a neotenic sunfish (Eaton, 1956). We hope to study the larval development of the Elassoma eye to determine if the spectacle persists through ontogeny as the spectacles of purely aquatic amphibians do according to Walls (1942 and personal communication). If the spectacle is of the primary type throughout development, the adult spectacle has as much right to be called primary as in lampreys, amphibian tadpoles, and adult aquatic amphibians. However, if the Elassoma larvae have the dermal and dural ele-",1963,Copeia
Lightweight amorphous silicon photovoltaic modules on flexible plastic substrate 1,"Solar cells on lightweight and flexible substrates have advantages over glassor wafer-based photovoltaic devices in both terrestrial and space applications. Here, we report on development of amorphous silicon thin film photovoltaic modules fabricated at maximum deposition temperature of 150 Â°C on 100 m thick polyethylene-naphtalate plastic films. Each module of 10 cm Ã— 10 cm area consists of 72 a-Si:H n-i-p rectangular structures with transparent conducting oxide top electrodes with Al fingers and metal back electrodes deposited through the shadow masks. Individual structures are connected in series forming eight rows with connection ports provided for external blocking diodes. The design optimization and device performance analysis are performed using a developed SPICE model. PACS Nos.: 88.40.H, 88.40.fc, 88.40.jj.

Metabolomic profiles and development of metabolic risk during the pubertal transition: A prospective study in the ELEMENT Project,"Objectives(1) Examine associations of a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolite pattern with metabolic risk across adolescence; (2) use Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to identify novel metabolites of metabolic risk.MethodsWe used linear regression to examine associations of a BCAA score with change (âˆ†) in metabolic biomarkers over 5-year follow-up in 179 adolescents 8â€“14 years at baseline. Next, we applied LASSO, a regularized regression technique well suited for reduction of high-dimensional data, to identify metabolite predictors of âˆ†biomarkers.ResultsIn boys, the BCAA score corresponded with decreasing C-peptide, C-peptide-based insulin resistance (CP-IR), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL). In pubertal girls, the BCAA pattern corresponded with increasing C-peptide and leptin. LASSO identified asparagine as a predictor of decreasing C-peptide (Î²â€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.33) and CP-IR (Î²â€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.012), and acetyl-carnitine (Î²â€‰=â€‰2.098), 4-hydroxyproline (Î²â€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.050), ornithine (Î²â€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.353), and Î±-aminoisobutyric acid (Î²â€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.793) as determinants of TC in boys. In girls, histidine was a negative determinant of TC (Î²â€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.033).ConclusionsThe BCAA pattern was associated with âˆ†glycemia and âˆ†lipids in a sex-specific manner. LASSO identified asparagine, which influences growth hormone secretion, as a determinant of decreasing C-peptide and CP-IR in boys, and metabolites on lipid metabolism pathways as determinants of decreasing cholesterol in both sexes.",2018,Pediatric research
Three CS-based beamformers for single snapshot DOA estimation,"In this work, the estimation of the Directions of Arrival (DOAs) of multiple source signals from a single observation vector is considered. In particular, the estimation, detection and super-resolution performance of three algorithms based on the theory of Compressed Sensing (the classical l1-minimization or LASSO, the fast smooth l0-minimization, and the SPICE algorithm) are analyzed and compared with the classical Fourier beamformer. This comparison is carried out using both simulated data and real sonar data.",2014,2014 22nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)
Release and re-hook: a novel method with combined use of clips and nylon snare to close a colonic defect after endoscopic mucosal resection.,"A 67-year-old man presented to our department for a screening colonoscopy, during which a 2-cm type IIa nonpolypoid lesion was found in the ascending colon (â—"" Fig.1a). After submucosal injection (saline with methylene blue) and adequate lifting of the lesion, a single-piece endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was performed. The post-EMR defect consisted only of serosal lining (â—"" Fig.1b). Because of its large size, attempts to close the defect with clips failed. A decision was made to close the defect with the combined use of clips and a nylon snare (HX400U; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The traditional method of snaring and clipping could not be performed. Therefore, we developed a new technique. At the patientâ€™s bedside, the nylon snare was opened and released from its original sheath (â—"" Fig.2a). The distal loop of the snare was enlarged to facilitate re-hooking (â—"" Fig.2b). The snare was grasped with a clip (QuickClip2; Olympus) and introduced into the working channel of the endoscope (â—"" Fig.2c,â—"" Fig.2d). The snare was delivered to the ascending colon (â—"" Fig.2e,â—"" Fig.3a), where it was anchored with multiple clips along the edges of the defect (â—"" Fig.3b). The distal end of the snare was then re-hooked and pulled back into the original sheath (â—"" Fig.2 f), enabling the closure to be completed in a â€œpurse-stringâ€ fashion (â—"" Fig.3c). Follow-up colonoscopy at 8 weeks demonstrated a healed defect, with both the snare and clip in situ (â—"" Fig.3d). The application of two accessories with a single-channel endoscope is either challenging or impossible. Perforations and large mucosal defects can be closed with the combined use of clips and a nylon snare using two methods. In the â€œtulipbundleâ€ technique the snare is lassoed and tightened over a bundle of clips attached at the edges of the tear [1]. In the â€œpurse-stringâ€ technique, the snare forms a nylon loop that is clipped around the edges of the lesion. Closure is accomplished by closing the snare [2,3]. However, with the tulip-bundle technique, there is a risk of the snare slipping over the clips, whereas the purse-string approach requires the use of a double-channel endoscope, or the snare must be fixed externally to the scope. In addition, it can be difficult to operate a double-channel endoscope or to maintain the position of an externally fixed snare in a redundant or tortuous colon.

Boosting with structural sparsity: A differential inclusion approach,"Abstract Boosting as gradient descent algorithms is one popular method in machine learning. In this paper a novel Boosting-type algorithm is proposed based on restricted gradient descent with structural sparsity control whose underlying dynamics are governed by differential inclusions. In particular, we present an iterative regularization path with structural sparsity where the parameter is sparse under some linear transforms, based on variable splitting and the Linearized Bregman Iteration. Hence it is called Split LBI. Despite its simplicity, Split LBI outperforms the popular generalized Lasso in both theory and experiments. A theory of path consistency is presented that equipped with a proper early stopping, Split LBI may achieve model selection consistency under a family of Irrepresentable Conditions which can be weaker than the necessary and sufficient condition for generalized Lasso. Furthermore, some l 2 error bounds are also given at the minimax optimal rates. The utility and benefit of the algorithm are illustrated by several applications including image denoising, partial order ranking of sport teams, and world university grouping with crowdsourced ranking data.",2017,Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis
Learning Gene Regulatory Networks with High-Dimensional Heterogeneous Data,"The Gaussian graphical model is a widely used tool for learning gene regulatory networks with high-dimensional gene expression data. Most existing methods for Gaussian graphical models assume that the data are homogeneous, i.e., all samples are drawn from a single Gaussian distribution. However, for many real problems, the data are heterogeneous, which may contain some subgroups or come from different resources. This paper proposes to model the heterogeneous data using a mixture Gaussian graphical model, and apply the imputation-consistency algorithm, combining with the Ïˆ-learning algorithm, to estimate the parameters of the mixture model and cluster the samples to different subgroups. An integrated Gaussian graphical network is learned across the subgroups along with the iterations of the imputation-consistency algorithm. The proposed method is compared with an existing method for learning mixture Gaussian graphical models as well as a few other methods developed for homogeneous data, such as graphical Lasso, nodewise regression, and Ïˆ-learning. The numerical results indicate superiority of the proposed method in all aspects of parameter estimation, cluster identification, and network construction. The numerical results also indicate generality of the proposed method: it can be applied to homogeneous data without significant harms.
