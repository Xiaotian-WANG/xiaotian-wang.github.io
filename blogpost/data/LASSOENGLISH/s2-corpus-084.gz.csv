A Randomized Algorithm for Parsimonious Model Identification,"Identifying parsimonious models is generically a â€œhardâ€ nonconvex problem. Available approaches typically rely on relaxations such as Group Lasso or nuclear norm minimization. Moreover, incorporating stability and model order constraints into the formalism in such methods entails a substantial increase in computational complexity. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper we present algorithms for parsimonious linear time invariant system identification aimed at identifying low-complexity models which i) incorporate a priori knowledge on the system (e.g., stability), ii) allow for data with missing/nonuniform measurements, and iii) are able to use data obtained from several runs of the system with different unknown initial conditions. The randomized algorithms proposed are based on the concept of atomic norm and provide a numerically efficient way to identify sparse models from large amounts of noisy data.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control
"Thalassobius aquaeponti sp. nov., an alphaproteobacterium isolated from seawater","A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped or ovoid bacterial strain, GJSW-22T, which was isolated from seawater at Geoje island in South Korea, was characterized taxonomically. Strain GJSW-22T was observed to grow optimally at 30Â Â°C, at pH 7.0â€“8.0 and in the presence of 2.0Â % (w/v) NaCl. In the neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain GJSW-22T grouped with the type strains of Thalassobius species, forming a stable cluster with the type strain of Thalassobius aestuarii (bootstrap value of 83.2Â %). Strain GJSW-22T exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity value (98.0Â %) to the type strain of T. aestuarii. It exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 95.6â€“96.1Â % to the type strains of the other Thalassobius species. Strain GJSW-22T was found to contain Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone and C18:1Ï‰7c and 11-methyl C18:1Ï‰7c as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids of strain GJSW-22T were identified as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified aminolipid and one unidentified lipid. The DNA GÂ +Â C content of strain GJSW-22T is 60.3Â molÂ % and its mean DNAâ€“DNA relatedness value with the type strain of T. aestuarii was 23Â %. Differential phenotypic properties, together with the phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic data, confirmed that strain GJSW-22T is distinct from other Thalassobius species. On the basis of the data presented, strain GJSW-22T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Thalassobius, for which the name Thalassobius aquaeponti sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GJSW-22T (=KCTC 42115TÂ =Â NBRC 110378T).",2014,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek

Anomaly Detection via Graphical Lasso,"Anomalies and outliers are common in real-world data, and they can arise from many sources, such as sensor faults. Accordingly, anomaly detection is important both for analyzing the anomalies themselves and for cleaning the data for further analysis of its ambient structure. Nonetheless, a precise definition of anomalies is important for automated detection and herein we approach such problems from the perspective of detecting sparse latent effects embedded in large collections of noisy data. Standard Graphical Lasso-based techniques can identify the conditional dependency structure of a collection of random variables based on their sample covariance matrix. However, classic Graphical Lasso is sensitive to outliers in the sample covariance matrix. In particular, several outliers in a sample covariance matrix can destroy the sparsity of its inverse. Accordingly, we propose a novel optimization problem that is similar in spirit to Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and splits the sample covariance matrix $M$ into two parts, $M=F+S$, where $F$ is the cleaned sample covariance whose inverse is sparse and computable by Graphical Lasso, and $S$ contains the outliers in $M$. We accomplish this decomposition by adding an additional $ \ell_1$ penalty to classic Graphical Lasso, and name it ""Robust Graphical Lasso (Rglasso)"". Moreover, we propose an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) solution to the optimization problem which scales to large numbers of unknowns. We evaluate our algorithm on both real and synthetic datasets, obtaining interpretable results and outperforming the standard robust Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) method and Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) regarding both accuracy and speed.",2018,ArXiv
Complexity Selection with Cross-validation for Lasso and Sparse Partial Least Squares Using High-Dimensional Data,"Sparse regression and classification methods are commonly applied to high-dimensional data to simultaneously build a prediction rule and select relevant predictors. The well-known lasso regression and the more recent sparse partial least squares (SPLS) approach are important examples. In such procedures, the number of identified relevant predictors typically depends on a complexity parameter that has to be adequately tuned. Most often, parameter tuning is performed via cross validation (CV). In the context of lasso penalized logistic regression and SPLS classification, this paper addresses three important questions related to complexity selection: (1) Does the number of folds in CV affect the results of the tuning procedure? (2) Should CV be repeated several times to yield less variable tuning results?, and (3) Is complexity selection robust against resampling?",2013,
"Thalassotalea coralli sp. nov., isolated from the torch coral Euphyllia glabrescens.","Strain Eup a-8T, isolated from a torch coral Euphyllia glabrescens, was characterized using a polyphasic taxonomy approach. Cells of strain Eup a-8T were Gram-staining-negative, aerobic, motile by means of a single polar flagellum, poly-Î²-hydroxybutyrate-containing, rod-shaped and formed white colonies. Optimal growth occurred at 25-30â€‰Â°C, pH 7-8, and in the presence of 2â€Š% NaCl. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain Eup a-8T belonged to the genus Thalassotalea and showed the highest levels of sequence similarity with respect to Thalassotalea ganghwensis JC2041T (97.1â€Š%).

A Shot Quality Adjusted Plus-Minus for the NHL,"We explore two regression models for creating an adjusted plus-minus statistic for the NHL. We compare an OLS regression models and a penalized gamma-lasso regression model. The traditional plus-minus metric is a simple marginal statistic that allocates a +1 to players for scoring a goal and a -1 for allowing a goal according to whether they were on the ice. This is a very noisy and uninformative statistic since it does not take into account the quality of the other players on the ice with an individual. We build off of previous research to create a more informative statistic that takes into account all of the players on the ice. This previous research has focused on goals to build an adjusted plus-minus, which is information deficient due to the fact that there are only approximately 5 goals scored per game. We improve upon this by instead using shots which provides us with ten times as much information per game. We use shot location data from 2007 to 2013 to create a smoothed probability map for the probability of scoring a goal from all locations in the offensive zone. We then model the shots from 2014-2015 season to get player estimates. Two models are compared, an OLS regression and a penalized regression (lasso). Finally, we compare our adjusted plusminus to the traditional plus-minus and complete a salary analysis to determine if teams are properly valuing players for the quality of shots they are taking and allowing.",2016,
Improved centroids estimation for the nearest shrunken centroid classifier,"MOTIVATION
The nearest shrunken centroid (NSC) method has been successfully applied in many DNA-microarray classification problems. The NSC uses 'shrunken' centroids as prototypes for each class and identifies subsets of genes that best characterize each class. Classification is then made to the nearest (shrunken) centroid. The NSC is very easy to implement and very easy to interpret, however, it has drawbacks.


RESULTS
We show that the NSC method can be interpreted in the framework of LASSO regression. Based on that, we consider two new methods, adaptive L(infinity)-norm penalized NSC (ALP-NSC) and adaptive hierarchically penalized NSC (AHP-NSC), with two different penalty functions for microarray classification, which improve over the NSC. Unlike the L(1)-norm penalty used in LASSO, the penalty terms that we consider make use of the fact that parameters belonging to one gene should be treated as a natural group. Numerical results indicate that the two new methods tend to remove irrelevant genes more effectively and provide better classification results than the L(1)-norm approach.

"Local Minimax Learning of Functions With Best Finite Sample Estimation Error Bounds: Applications to Ridge and Lasso Regression, Boosting, Tree Learning, Kernel Machines, and Inverse Problems","Optimal local estimation is formulated in the minimax sense for inverse problems and nonlinear regression. This theory provides best mean squared finite sample error bounds for some popular statistical learning algorithms and also for several optimal improvements of other existing learning algorithms such as smoothing splines and kernel regularization. The bounds and improved algorithms are not based on asymptotics or Bayesian assumptions and are truly local for each query, not depending on cross validating estimates at other queries to optimize modeling parameters. Results are given for optimal local learning of approximately linear functions with side information (context) using real algebraic geometry. In particular, finite sample error bounds are given for ridge regression and for a local version of lasso regression. The new regression methods require only quadratic programming with linear or quadratic inequality constraints for implementation. Greedy additive expansions are then combined with local minimax learning via a change in metric. An optimal strategy is presented for fusing the local minimax estimators of a class of experts-providing optimal finite sample prediction error bounds from (random) forests. Local minimax learning is extended to kernel machines. Best local prediction error bounds for finite samples are given for Tikhonov regularization. The geometry of reproducing kernel Hilbert space is used to derive improved estimators with finite sample mean squared error (MSE) bounds for class membership probability in two class pattern classification problems. A purely local, cross validation free algorithm is proposed which uses Fisher information with these bounds to determine best local kernel shape in vector machine learning. Finally, a locally quadratic solution to the finite Fourier moments problem is presented. After reading the first three sections the reader may proceed directly to any of the subsequent applications sections.",2009,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
Lagged kernel machine regression for identifying time windows of susceptibility to exposures of complex mixtures.,"The impact of neurotoxic chemical mixtures on children's health is a critical public health concern. It is well known that during early life, toxic exposures may impact cognitive function during critical time intervals of increased vulnerability, known as windows of susceptibility. Knowledge on time windows of susceptibility can help inform treatment and prevention strategies, as chemical mixtures may affect a developmental process that is operating at a specific life phase. There are several statistical challenges in estimating the health effects of time-varying exposures to multi-pollutant mixtures, such as: multi-collinearity among the exposures both within time points and across time points, and complex exposure-response relationships. To address these concerns, we develop a flexible statistical method, called lagged kernel machine regression (LKMR). LKMR identifies critical exposure windows of chemical mixtures, and accounts for complex non-linear and non-additive effects of the mixture at any given exposure window. Specifically, LKMR estimates how the effects of a mixture of exposures change with the exposure time window using a Bayesian formulation of a grouped, fused lasso penalty within a kernel machine regression (KMR) framework. A simulation study demonstrates the performance of LKMR under realistic exposure-response scenarios, and demonstrates large gains over approaches that consider each time window separately, particularly when serial correlation among the time-varying exposures is high. Furthermore, LKMR demonstrates gains over another approach that inputs all time-specific chemical concentrations together into a single KMR. We apply LKMR to estimate associations between neurodevelopment and metal mixtures in Early Life Exposures in Mexico and Neurotoxicology, a prospective cohort study of child health in Mexico City.",2018,Biostatistics
Fortune Teller: Predicting Your Career Path,"People go to fortune tellers in hopes of learning things about their future. A future career path is one of the topics most frequently discussed. But rather than rely on ""black arts"" to make predictions, in this work we scientifically and systematically study the feasibility of career path prediction from social network data. In particular, we seamlessly fuse information from multiple social networks to comprehensively describe a user and characterize progressive properties of his or her career path. This is accomplished via a multi-source learning framework with fused lasso penalty, which jointly regularizes the source and career-stage relatedness. Extensive experiments on real-world data confirm the accuracy of our model.",2016,

The ultrastructure of some Rhaetian Circumpolles from southern England,"Abstract The morphology and exine ultrastructure of Classopollis torosus, C. meyeriana and Geopollis zwolinskae are studied from the Cotham Member of the Lilstock Formation (Penarth Group) in southern England. The palynological assemblage that allows dating the deposits to the Rhaetian is outlined. Although the Circumpolles pollen grains under study show variations in the exine ultrastructure, some common characters support their origin from the same plant group, the Cheirolepidiaceae. An infratectum formed by large granulae arranged mostly in one row and sandwiched between the tectum and endexine is considered as the key character of the pollen grains under study. Ultrastructural transformations within Circumpolles are discussed. The origin of Classopollis-producing plants from any plant group with saccate pollen and alveolate ectexine is considered much less probable than from a group with non-saccate pollen with granular ectexine.",2010,Grana
Detection and Estimation of Multiple DoA Targets with Single Snapshot Measurements,"In this paper, we explore the problems of detecting the number of narrow-band, far-field targets and estimating their corresponding directions of arrivals (DoAs) from single snapshot measurements. We use the principles of sparse signal recovery (SSR) for detection and estimation of multiple targets. In the SSR framework, the DoA estimation problem is grid based and can be posed as the lasso optimization problem. The corresponding DoA detection problem reduces to estimating the optimal regularization parameter $(\tau)$ of the lasso problem for achieving the required probability of correct detection $(P_{c})$. We propose finite sample and asymptotic test statistics for detecting the number of sources with the required $P_{c}$ at moderate to high signal to noise ratios. Once the number of sources are detected, or equivalently the optimal $\hat{\tau}$ is estimated, the corresponding DoAs can be estimated by solving the lasso with regularization parameter set to $\hat{\tau}$.",2019,2019 National Conference on Communications (NCC)
Robust and sparse k-means clustering for high-dimensional data,"In real-world application scenarios, the identification of groups poses a significant challenge due to possibly occurring outliers and existing noise variables. Therefore, there is a need for a clustering method which is capable of revealing the group structure in data containing both outliers and noise variables without any pre-knowledge. In this paper, we propose a k-means-based algorithm incorporating a weighting function which leads to an automatic weight assignment for each observation. In order to cope with noise variables, a lasso-type penalty is used in an objective function adjusted by observation weights. We finally introduce a framework for selecting both the number of clusters and variables based on a modified gap statistic. The conducted experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate the advantage of the method to identify groups, outliers, and informative variables simultaneously.",2019,Advances in Data Analysis and Classification
Exact Posterior Simulation from the Linear Lasso Regression,"The current popular method for approximate simulation from the posterior distribution of the linear Bayesian LASSO is a Gibbs sampler. It is well-known that the output analysis of an MCMC sampler is difficult due to the complex dependence amongst the states of the underlying Markov chain. Practitioners can usually only assess the convergence of MCMC samplers using heuristics. In this paper we construct a method that yields an independent and identically distributed (iid) draws from the LASSO posterior. The advantage of such exact sampling over the MCMC sampling is that there are no difficulties with the output analysis of the exact sampler, because all the simulated states are independent. The proposed sampler works well when the dimension of the parameter space is not too large, and when it is too large to permit exact sampling, the proposed method can still be used to construct an approximate MCMC sampler.",2018,
Dual Extrapolation for Faster Lasso Solvers,"Convex sparsity-inducing regularizations are ubiquitous in high-dimension machine learning, but their non-differentiability requires the use of iterative solvers. To accelerate such solvers, state-of-the-art approaches consist in reducing the size of the optimization problem at hand. In the context of regression, this can be achieved either by discarding irrelevant features (screening techniques) or by prioritizing features likely to be included in the support of the solution (working set techniques). Duality comes into play at several steps in these techniques. Here, we propose an extrapolation technique starting from a sequence of iterates in the dual that leads to the construction of an improved dual point. This enables a tighter control of optimality as used in stopping criterion, as well as better screening performance of Gap Safe rules. Finally, we propose a working set strategy based on an aggressive use of Gap Safe rules and our new dual point construction, which improves state-of-the-art time performance on Lasso problems.",2018,

The R package FANet: sparse factor analysis model for high dimensional gene co-expression networks,"Inference on gene regulatory networks from high-throughput expression data turns out to be one of the
main current challenges in systems biology. Such interaction networks are very insightful for the deep
understanding of biological relationships between genes. In particular, a functional characterization of gene
modules of highly interacting genes enables the identification of biological processes underlying complex
traits as diseases. Inference on this dependence structure shall account for both the high dimension of the
data and the sparsity of the interaction network.
The R package FANet provides a powerful method for estimating high dimensional co-expression networks.
Extending the idea introduced for differential analysis by Blum et al. [1] and Friguet et al. [2] we suggest
to take advantage of a low-dimensional latent linear structure of dependence to improve the stability of
correlation estimations. We propose an EM algorithm to fit a sparse factor model for correlations and
demonstrate how it helps extracting modules of genes and more generally improves the gene clustering
performance. Two functions are available in FANet package in order to introduce sparsity in the network
estimation. One function is based on a LASSO estimation using a cyclic coordinate descent algorithm. As an
alternative, the second function is based on biological knowledge integration as Gene Ontology annotation.
Finally, FANet results can serve as an input for WGCNA (Langfelder and Horvath [3]) procedure for gene

Leveraging input and output structures for joint mapping of epistatic and marginal eQTLs,"MOTIVATION
As many complex disease and expression phenotypes are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular networks underlying gene regulation resulted from interdependent genome variations, association mapping of causal QTLs or expression quantitative trait loci must consider both additive and epistatic effects of multiple candidate genotypes. This problem poses a significant challenge to contemporary genome-wide-association (GWA) mapping technologies because of its computational complexity. Fortunately, a plethora of recent developments in biological network community, especially the availability of genetic interaction networks, make it possible to construct informative priors of complex interactions between genotypes, which can substantially reduce the complexity and increase the statistical power of GWA inference.


RESULTS
In this article, we consider the problem of learning a multitask regression model while taking advantage of the prior information on structures on both the inputs (genetic variations) and outputs (expression levels). We propose a novel regularization scheme over multitask regression called jointly structured input-output lasso based on an â„“(1)/â„“(2) norm, which allows shared sparsity patterns for related inputs and outputs to be optimally estimated. Such patterns capture multiple related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that jointly influence multiple-related expression traits. In addition, we generalize this new multitask regression to structurally regularized polynomial regression to detect epistatic interactions with manageable complexity by exploiting the prior knowledge on candidate SNPs for epistatic effects from biological experiments. We demonstrate our method on simulated and yeast eQTL datasets.

Integrative Generalized Convex Clustering Optimization and Feature Selection for Mixed Multi-View Data,"In mixed multi-view data, multiple sets of diverse features are measured on the same set of samples. By integrating all available data sources, we seek to discover common group structure among the samples that may be hidden in individualistic cluster analyses of a single data-view. While several techniques for such integrative clustering have been explored, we propose and develop a convex formalization that will inherit the strong statistical, mathematical and empirical properties of increasingly popular convex clustering methods. Specifically, our Integrative Generalized Convex Clustering Optimization (iGecco) method employs different convex distances, losses, or divergences for each of the different data views with a joint convex fusion penalty that leads to common groups. Additionally, integrating mixed multi-view data is often challenging when each data source is high-dimensional. To perform feature selection in such scenarios, we develop an adaptive shifted group-lasso penalty that selects features by shrinking them towards their loss-specific centers. Our so-called iGecco+ approach selects features from each data-view that are best for determining the groups, often leading to improved integrative clustering. To fit our model, we develop a new type of generalized multi-block ADMM algorithm using sub-problem approximations that more efficiently fits our model for big data sets. Through a series of numerical experiments and real data examples on text mining and genomics, we show that iGecco+ achieves superior empirical performance for high-dimensional mixed multi-view data.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Wild or cultivated Olea europaea L. in the eastern Mediterranean during the middle-late Holocene? A pollen-numerical approach,"Assessment of the wild or cultivated origin of Olea europaea L. during the middle to late Holocene according to pollen analyses is of palaeoecological and evolutionary interest as olive is thought to be one of the earliest cultivated trees and is still one of the most important fruit trees of the eastern Mediterranean. This paper considers data from the Bronzeâ€”Iron Age harbour-town, Tell Tweini, of the Ugarit Kingdom, in the Syrian coastal lowland near Jableh (17 m a.s.l.) and from the Hellenisticâ€”Roman Moatra-Bereket (1410 m a.s.l.), in the territory of Sagalassos, in Turkeyâ€™s western Taurus Mountains. Both of these sites have recorded the rise and collapse of early eastern Mediterranean urban systems from 4200 to 1600 cal. yr BP.

Constrained Candecomp/Parafac via the Lasso,"The Candecomp/Parafac (CP) model is a well-known tool for summarizing a three-way array by extracting a limited number of components. Unfortunately, in some cases, the model suffers from the so-called degeneracy, that is a solution with diverging and uninterpretable components. To avoid degeneracy, orthogonality constraints are usually applied to one of the component matrices. This solves the problem only from a technical point of view because the existence of orthogonal components underlying the data is not guaranteed. For this purpose, we consider some variants of the CP model where the orthogonality constraints are relaxed either by constraining only a pair, or a subset, of components or by stimulating the CP solution to be possibly orthogonal. We theoretically clarify that only the latter approach, based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and named the CP-Lasso, is helpful in solving the degeneracy problem. The results of the application of CP-Lasso on simulated and real life data show its effectiveness.",2013,Psychometrika
Development of a prediction model for longâ€term quality of life in critically ill patients,"Purpose: We developed a prediction model for quality of life (QOL) 1 year after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge based upon data available at the first ICU day to improve decisionâ€making. Methods: The database of a 1â€year prospective study concerning longâ€term outcome and QOL (assessed by EuroQolâ€5D) in critically ill adult patients consecutively admitted to the ICU of a university hospital was used. Cases with missing data were excluded. Utility indices at baseline (UIb) and at 1 year (UI1y) were surrogates for QOL. For 1â€year nonâ€survivors UI1y was set at zero. The grouped lasso technique selected the most important variables in the prediction model. R2 and adjusted R2 were calculated. Results: 1831 of 1953 cases (93.8%) were complete. UI1y depended significantly on: UIb (P < 0.001); solid tumor (P < 0.001); age (P < 0.001); activity of daily living (P < 0.001); imaging (P < 0.001); APACHE IIâ€score (P = 0.001); â‰¥80 years (P = 0.001); mechanical ventilation (P = 0.006); hematological patient (P = 0.007); SOFAâ€score (P = 0.008); tracheotomy (P = 0.018); admission diagnosis surgical P < 0.001 (versus medical); and comorbidity (P = 0.049). Only baseline health status and surgical patients were positively associated with UI1y. R2 was 0.3875 and adjusted R2 0.3807. Conclusion: Although only 40% of variability in longâ€term QOL could be explained, this prediction model can be helpful in decisionâ€making.

Equity in College Physics Student Learning: a Critical Quantitative Intersectionality Investigation,"We investigated the intersectional nature of race/racism and gender/sexism in broad scale inequities in physics student learning using a critical quantitative intersectionality. To provide transparency and create a nuanced picture of learning, we problematized the measurement of equity by using two competing operationalizations of equity: Equity of Individuality and Equality of Learning. These two models led to conflicting conclusions. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine student's conceptual learning as measured by gains in scores on research-based assessments administered as pretests and posttests. The data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes' (LASSO) national database and included data from 13,857 students in 187 first-semester college physics courses. Findings showed differences in student gains across gender and race. Large gender differences existed for White and Hispanic students but not for Asian, Black, and Pacific Islander students. The models predicted larger gains for students in collaborative learning than in lecture-based courses. The Equity of Individuality operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction improved equity because all groups learned more with collaborative learning. The Equality of Learning operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction did not improve equity because differences between groups were unaffected. We discuss the implications of these mixed findings and identify areas for future research using critical quantitative perspectives in education research.",2018,Journal of Research in Science Teaching
On change point detection using the fused lasso method,"In this paper we analyze the asymptotic properties of l1 penalized maximum likelihood estimation of signals with piece-wise constant mean values and/or variances.

This change point detection and estimation problem is also referred to as total variation denoising or l1 -mean filtering and has many important applications in most fields of science and engineering. We establish the (approximate) sparse consistency properties, including rate of convergence, of the so-called fused lasso signal approximator (FLSA). We show that this only holds if the sign of the corresponding consecutive changes are all different, and that this estimator is otherwise incapable of correctly detecting the underlying sparsity pattern. The key idea is to notice that the optimality conditions for this problem can be analyzed using techniques related to brownian bridge theory.",2014,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Design and operation of a small-scale carbonization kiln for cashew nutshell valorization in Burkina Faso,"Abstract This paper describes the process of planning, design, building and first operation tests of a carbonization reactor for the valorization of cashew nutshells, obtained as byproduct from small-scale cashew cultivation and processing in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. The main technical requirements for the reactor were: low cost and ease of construction, robustness, autothermal operation, no need for pre or post-treatments for feedstock and products, and readily useable product fractions in a local scale. Design modifications are discussed and justified. Characterization of the raw material, data from the first successful operational tests, as well as product distribution and characterization, are presented. This carbonization prototype allows for the sustainable valorization of an otherwise problematic biomass residue, creating added-value products that would enhance the economic profitability of local processors. The use of the main charcoal product as a fuel substitute for household cooking is preliminarily assessed, and the recovery of potentially valuable cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL) is accomplished.",2019,Energy for Sustainable Development
Machine learning derived risk prediction of anorexia nervosa,"BackgroundAnorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex psychiatric disease with a moderate to strong genetic contribution. In addition to conventional genome wide association (GWA) studies, researchers have been using machine learning methods in conjunction with genomic data to predict risk of diseases in which genetics play an important role.MethodsIn this study, we collected whole genome genotyping data on 3940 AN cases and 9266 controls from the Genetic Consortium for Anorexia Nervosa (GCAN), the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 3 (WTCCC3), Price Foundation Collaborative Group and the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and applied machine learning methods for predicting AN disease risk. The prediction performance is measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), indicating how well the model distinguishes cases from unaffected control subjects.ResultsLogistic regression model with the lasso penalty technique generated an AUC of 0.693, while Support Vector Machines and Gradient Boosted Trees reached AUCâ€™s of 0.691 and 0.623, respectively. Using different sample sizes, our results suggest that larger datasets are required to optimize the machine learning models and achieve higher AUC values.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first attempt to assess AN risk based on genome wide genotype level data. Future integration of genomic, environmental and family-based information is likely to improve the AN risk evaluation process, eventually benefitting AN patients and families in the clinical setting.",2016,BMC Medical Genomics
A regularization approach for the detection of differential item functioning in generalized partial credit models,"Most common analysis tools for the detection of differential item functioning (DIF) in item response theory are restricted to the use of single covariates. If several variables have to be considered, the respective method is repeated independently for each variable. We propose a regularization approach based on the lasso principle for the detection of uniform DIF. It is applicable to a broad range of polytomous item response models with the generalized partial credit model as the most general case. A joint model is specified where the possible DIF effects for all items and all covariates are explicitly parameterized. The model is estimated using a penalized likelihood approach that automatically detects DIF effects and provides trait estimates that correct for the detected DIF effects from different covariates simultaneously. The approach is evaluated by means of several simulation studies. An application is presented using data from the childrenâ€™s depression inventory.",2019,Behavior Research Methods
Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies with Multiple Outcomes Using Penalization,"Genome-wide association studies have been extensively conducted, searching for markers for biologically meaningful outcomes and phenotypes. Penalization methods have been adopted in the analysis of the joint effects of a large number of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and marker identification. This study is partly motivated by the analysis of heterogeneous stock mice dataset, in which multiple correlated phenotypes and a large number of SNPs are available. Existing penalization methods designed to analyze a single response variable cannot accommodate the correlation among multiple response variables. With multiple response variables sharing the same set of markers, joint modeling is first employed to accommodate the correlation. The group Lasso approach is adopted to select markers associated with all the outcome variables. An efficient computational algorithm is developed. Simulation study and analysis of the heterogeneous stock mice dataset show that the proposed method can outperform existing penalization methods.",2012,PLoS ONE
Evaluating and Predicting the Probability of Death in Patients with Non-Metastatic Osteosarcoma: A Population-Based Study,"BACKGROUND Osteosarcoma is one of the most common bone tumors, with strong local aggressiveness and early metastasis. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological data and evaluate the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS) in patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients histologically diagnosed with non-metastatic osteosarcoma between 2005 and 2014 were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Survival analysis, machine learning, and Lasso regression were used to identify the prognostic factors for OS and CSS, and the accuracy of the nomograms was tested and compared with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging systems. RESULTS The entire cohort comprised 1000 patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma. The multivariable analysis suggested that age, tumor size, grade, and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) T staging were independent prognostic factors for OS and CSS. Additionally, the nomograms based on these results could better predict probability of OS (Internal validation C-index, 0.7095) and CSS (0.7100) compared with the sixth (OS: 0.613; CSS: 0.628) and seventh edition AJCC staging systems (0.602, 0.613). CONCLUSIONS Relatively young age and low histopathological grade were favorable factors for both OS and CSS. Nomograms based on multivariable models worked well in predicting the probability of death for patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma.",2019,Medical Science Monitor : International Medical Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research
[Implementation of hemovigilance in Sub-Saharan Africa].,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
Hemovigilance being an essential part of blood transfusion safety, many countries have set legislation for its organization and its establishment. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where transfusion practice is facing many challenges, hemovigilance does not always appear as a priority. Nevertheless, in 2000, Burkina Faso decided to reorganize its blood transfusion system according to the World Health Organisation recommendations and other international standards. A national blood transfusion center and regional blood transfusion centers were created. From 2005 to 2009, a hemovigilance pilot project was conducted by the regional blood transfusion center of Bobo-Dioulasso.


METHODS
The implementation of this hemovigilance project included the following steps: training of medical and paramedical personnel of the health facilities provided with blood and blood products by the regional blood transfusion center, distribution of post transfusion and hemovigilance forms, and the creation of a hemovigilance and transfusion committee.


RESULTS
During the period 2005-2009, 34,729 blood products were distributed for 23,478 patients. The return rate of the post-transfusion and hemovigilance forms (number of files completed partially or completely and returned to the regional blood transfusion center compared to the number of units distributed) raised from 83.1 to 94.8%, the rate of traceability (rate of forms returned to the regional blood transfusion center and totally completed) raised from 71.6 to 91.6%, and the concordance between the patient for which the blood was delivered and the patient transfused moved from 92.9 to 98.0%. The notification rate of transfusion incidents raised from 1.1 to 16.1 per 1000 units transfused during that period.


CONCLUSION
The implementation of a hemovigilance system is possible in the Sub-Sahara African countries. This constitutes a major element in the improvement of different steps of transfusion safety. The implementation of a hemovigilance system requires negotiations between transfusion centers and the hospital personnel, and should be facilitated by the official regulation on blood transfusion practices.",2012,Transfusion clinique et biologique : journal de la Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine
"The cranial anatomy of Thalassocnus (Xenarthra, Mammalia), a derived nothrothere from the Neogene of the Pisco Formation (Peru)","Abstract The Pisco Formation (Mioceneâ€“Pliocene) of Peru contains a diverse marine vertebrate fauna. Among the more unusual members of the fauna is the semi-aquatic to aquatic nothrothere sloth, Thalassocnus. Continued fieldwork indicates that, in addition to the late Miocene type species, Thalassocnus natans, the genus is also represented by two additional species in higher horizons of the Pisco Formation. The skull morphology of T. natans is described along with that of Thalassocnus littoralis, sp. nov. and Thalassocnus carolomartini, sp. nov. from the earliest and late early to early late Pliocene, respectively. Many aspects of the cranium of the oldest species of Thalassocnus, T. natans, compare well to those of terrestrial nothrotheres. The terminal species, T. carolomartini, has the most derived features of the skull, absent in all other nothrotheres, that are related to feeding in a marine environment.",2002,
A biological mechanism for Bayesian feature selection: Weight decay and raising the LASSO,"Biological systems are capable of learning that certain stimuli are valuable while ignoring the many that are not, and thus perform feature selection. In machine learning, one effective feature selection approach is the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) form of regularization, which is equivalent to assuming a Laplacian prior distribution on the parameters. We review how such Bayesian priors can be implemented in gradient descent as a form of weight decay, which is a biologically plausible mechanism for Bayesian feature selection. In particular, we describe a new prior that offsets or ""raises"" the Laplacian prior distribution. We evaluate this alongside the Gaussian and Cauchy priors in gradient descent using a generic regression task where there are few relevant and many irrelevant features. We find that raising the Laplacian leads to less prediction error because it is a better model of the underlying distribution. We also consider two biologically relevant online learning tasks, one synthetic and one modeled after the perceptual expertise task of Krigolson et al. (2009). Here, raising the Laplacian prior avoids the fast erosion of relevant parameters over the period following training because it only allows small weights to decay. This better matches the limited loss of association seen between days in the human data of the perceptual expertise task. Raising the Laplacian prior thus results in a biologically plausible form of Bayesian feature selection that is effective in biologically relevant contexts.",2015,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society
Do coral reef fish learn to avoid unpalatable prey using visual cues?,"Colour and pattern provide important visual cues that affect animal behaviour. Learned avoidance of unpalatable prey by coral reef fish in response to visual cues has been studied before, but visual cues have not been separated from distastefulness to make certain that fish were learning solely in response to visual signals. Here, we used artificial foods to test the ability of wild-caught bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum , a common Caribbean reef fish, to learn to avoid unpalatable prey in laboratory experiments. First, we tested whether the relative position of foods of the same or different colours affected avoidance of unpalatable prey. Next, we tested whether blueheads could learn to avoid different colours of unpalatable prey. These experiments also tested whether blueheads could learn to avoid unpalatable prey against a pre-experimental colour bias. Finally, we determined whether blueheads learn to avoid unpalatable prey more effectively using colour or pattern signals. Fish learned to avoid unpalatable prey using colour independent of prey position, and they learned to avoid some colours (red, blue and orange), but not others (yellow, purple and green), based on visual cues alone. Fish avoided yellow, purple and green coloured prey, regardless of whether they were palatable or unpalatable. Fish only avoided white prey when unpalatable. Fish rapidly learned to overcome a strong pre-experimental bias against red prey. There was no difference in the ability of fish to learn to avoid prey using colour or pattern. We conclude that blueheads learn to avoid unpalatable prey using visual signals alone, that they have different responses to different colours and that they adapt quickly to novel prey appearance. Our results do not support the concept that specific prey colours, such as red or orange, strictly signal a chemical defence, but that blueheads continually assess and adapt to prey palatability using visual cues.",2013,Animal Behaviour
Bootstrapping LASSO-type estimators in regression models,"Abstract We study the consistency of the standard (non-parametric) bootstrap, the m -out-of- n bootstrap, and the oracle bootstrap distributions of some popular LASSO-type estimators in regression models with random predictors. These estimators have an oracle property and are often used in estimation of sparse regression models. A local asymptotic analysis further reveals the behavior of these estimators and of their bootstrap distributions when some regression coefficients approach zero at various rates. In a simulation study, we assess the finite sample properties of the estimators and of their bootstrap distributions for various sample sizes and model parameters. The analysis of a prostate cancer data set shows an application of LASSO-type inference and bootstrap methods in practice.",2019,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference
On Numerical Aspects of Bayesian Model Selection in High and Ultrahigh-dimensional Settings.,"This article examines the convergence properties of a Bayesian model selection procedure based on a non-local prior density in ultrahigh-dimensional settings. The performance of the model selection procedure is also compared to popular penalized likelihood methods. Coupling diagnostics are used to bound the total variation distance between iterates in an Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and the posterior distribution on the model space. In several simulation scenarios in which the number of observations exceeds 100, rapid convergence and high accuracy of the Bayesian procedure is demonstrated. Conversely, the coupling diagnostics are successful in diagnosing lack of convergence in several scenarios for which the number of observations is less than 100. The accuracy of the Bayesian model selection procedure in identifying high probability models is shown to be comparable to commonly used penalized likelihood methods, including extensions of smoothly clipped absolute deviations (SCAD) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) procedures.",2013,Bayesian analysis
Pruned Wasserstein Index Generation Model and wigpy Package,"Recent proposal of Wasserstein Index Generation model (WIG) has shown a new direction for automatically generating indices. However, it is challenging in practice to fit large datasets for two reasons. First, the Sinkhorn distance is notoriously expensive to compute and suffers from dimensionality severely. Second, it requires to compute a full $N\times N$ matrix to be fit into memory, where $N$ is the dimension of vocabulary. When the dimensionality is too large, it is even impossible to compute at all. I hereby propose a Lasso-based shrinkage method to reduce dimensionality for the vocabulary as a pre-processing step prior to fitting the WIG model. After we get the word embedding from Word2Vec model, we could cluster these high-dimensional vectors by $k$-means clustering, and pick most frequent tokens within each cluster to form the ""base vocabulary"". Non-base tokens are then regressed on the vectors of base token to get a transformation weight and we could thus represent the whole vocabulary by only the ""base tokens"". This variant, called pruned WIG (pWIG), will enable us to shrink vocabulary dimension at will but could still achieve high accuracy. I also provide a \textit{wigpy} module in Python to carry out computation in both flavor. Application to Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index is showcased as comparison with existing methods of generating time-series sentiment indices.",2020,ArXiv

2 Model and Methods 2 . 1 Spatial Regression with GIS Layers,"Geographic information systems (GIS) organize spatial data in multiple two-dimensional arrays called layers. In many applications, a response of interest is observed on a set of sites in the landscape, and it is of interest to build a regression model from the GIS layers to predict the response at unsampled sites. Model selection in this context then consists not only of selecting appropriate layers, but also of choosing appropriate neighborhoods within those layers. We formalize this problem and propose the use of Lasso to simultaneously select variables, choose neighborhoods, and estimate parameters. Spatial smoothness in selected coefficients is incorporated through use of a priori spatial covariance structure, and this leads to a modification of the Lasso procedure. The LARS algorithm, which can be used in a fast implementation of Lasso, is also modified to yield a fast implementation of spatial Lasso. The spatial Lasso performs well in numerical examples, including an application to prediction of soil moisture.",2006,
A Delta-radiomics model for preoperative evaluation of Neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in high-grade osteosarcoma,"The difficulty of assessment of neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic response preoperatively may hinder personalized-medicine strategies that depend on the results from pathological examination. A total of 191 patients with high-grade osteosarcoma (HOS) were enrolled retrospectively from November 2013 to November 2017 and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). A cutoff time of November 2016 was used to divide the training set and validation set. All patients underwent diagnostic CTs before and after chemotherapy. By quantifying the tumor regions on the CT images before and after NCT, 540 delta-radiomic features were calculated. The interclass correlation coefficients for segmentations of inter/intra-observers and feature pair-wise correlation coefficients (Pearson) were used for robust feature selection. A delta-radiomics signature was constructed using the lasso algorithm based on the training set. Radiomics signatures built from single-phase CT were constructed for comparison purpose. A radiomics nomogram was then developed from the multivariate logistic regression model by combining independent clinical factors and the delta-radiomics signature. The prediction performance was assessed using area under the ROC curve (AUC), calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). The delta-radiomics signature showed higher AUC than single-CT based radiomics signatures in both training and validation cohorts. The delta-radiomics signature, consisting of 8 selected features, showed significant differences between the pathologic good response (pGR) (necrosis fraction â‰¥90%) group and the non-pGR (necrosis fraction <â€‰90%) group (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001, in both training and validation sets). The delta-radiomics nomogram, which consisted of the delta-radiomics signature and new pulmonary metastasis during chemotherapy showed good calibration and great discrimination capacity with AUC 0.871 (95% CI, 0.804 to 0.923) in the training cohort, and 0.843 (95% CI, 0.718 to 0.927) in the validation cohort. The DCA confirmed the clinical utility of the radiomics model. The delta-radiomics nomogram incorporating the radiomics signature and clinical factors in this study could be used for individualized pathologic response evaluation after chemotherapy preoperatively and help tailor appropriate chemotherapy and further treatment plans.",2020,Cancer Imaging
"International workshop Knots and Polymers Aspects of topological entanglement in DNA , proteins and graph-shaped polymers August 8-10","``Three Points are taken at random on an infinite Plane. Find the chance of their being the vertices of an obtuse-angled Triangle.'' This is the text of Lewis Carrollâ€™s Pillow Problem #58, from 1884. This and similar problems (e.g., ``what's the probability that a random quadrilateral is convex?'') sparked intense debate in the 19th century as mathematics was just starting to get to grips with the basics of geometric probability. Using the Grassmannian model of random polygons developed with Cantarella and Deguchi and based on work of Hausmann and Knutson, I will present the exact probability that a triangle is obtuse and that a polygon is convex, as well as precise statements about extreme and average triangles. Though this work is focused on planar polygons with few edges, it provides a template for integration and clustering in the physically-relevant setting of polygons in space. This is joint work with Laney Bowden, Jason Cantarella, Andrea Haynes, Tom Needham, Aaron Shukert, and Gavin Stewart. Statistical and Hydrodynamic Properties of Graph-shaped Polymers and Quaternions Tetsuo Deguchi Ochanomizu University We study statistical and hydrodynamic properties of graph-shaped polymers, which we call topological polymers, by applying the quaternion method for generating random polygons. We first review topological polymers such as double-ring polymers, tadpole polymers (lassos), and complete bipartite graph polymers, which are synthesized in chemistry. For simplicity, we regard ring polymers as topological polymers. We introduce the algorithm for generating random walks connecting given two points in the three-dimensional space, based on the Hopf map of quaternions [1, 2]. Surprisingly, the computational time of the algorithm is proportional to the number of steps in the random walks, that is, it gives a linear-time algorithm [1]. We compare the results of ideal topological polymers with those of real topological polymer obtained by the molecular dynamical simulation of the Kremer-Grest model. We suggest that for such graphs consisting of only up to trivalent vertices the statistical and hydrodynamic properties of ideal topological polymers are similar to those of the corresponding real topological polymers [2]. Finally, we also suggest enhancement of intra-chain two-point short-distance correlation for real topological polymers [2]. The talk is based on the collaboration with J. Cantarella, C. Shonkwiler and E. Uehara. [1] J. Cantarella, T. Deguchi, and C. Shonkwiler, Probability Theory of Random Polygons from the Quaternionic Viewpoint, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. Vol. 67, 1658-1699 (2014).

Studying the Impact of Water Supply on Wheat Yield by using Principle Lasso Radial Machine Learning Model,"Wheat plays a vital role in the food production as it fulfills 60% requirements of calories and proteins to the 35% of the world population. Owing to wheat importance in food, wheat demand is increasing continuously. Wheat yield is committed to the availability of water supply. Due to climatic and environmental variations of different countries, water supply is not available in constant and desire quantity that is necessary for better wheat yield. So, there is a strong relationship and dependency that exists between water supply and wheat yield. Therefore, water supply is becoming an issue because it directly effects wheat yield. In this research, a Principle Lasso Radial (PLR) model is proposed using Machine Learning technique to measure the effect of water supply on wheat yield. In this Principle Lasso Radial (PLR) model, various experiments are conducted with respect to the performance metrics, i.e. relative water contents, waxiness, grain per spike and plant height. Principle Lasso Radial (PLR) modelâ€™s produced reduced dimensional data with respect to performance metrics. That data is provided to Radial Basis Neural Network (RBNN), and it showed regression values R under different water supply conditions. Principle Lasso Radial (PLR) model achieved an accuracy of 89% among variance Machine Learning techniques.",2018,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications
Bayesian sparse graphical models and their mixtures.,"We propose Bayesian methods for Gaussian graphical models that lead to sparse and adaptively shrunk estimators of the precision (inverse covariance) matrix. Our methods are based on lasso-type regularization priors leading to parsimonious parameterization of the precision matrix, which is essential in several applications involving learning relationships among the variables. In this context, we introduce a novel type of selection prior that develops a sparse structure on the precision matrix by making most of the elements exactly zero, in addition to ensuring positive definiteness - thus conducting model selection and estimation simultaneously. More importantly, we extend these methods to analyze clustered data using finite mixtures of Gaussian graphical model and infinite mixtures of Gaussian graphical models. We discuss appropriate posterior simulation schemes to implement posterior inference in the proposed models, including the evaluation of normalizing constants that are functions of parameters of interest, which result from the restriction of positive definiteness on the correlation matrix. We evaluate the operating characteristics of our method via several simulations and demonstrate the application to real data examples in genomics.",2014,Stat
Sparse group variable selection based on quantile hierarchical Lasso,"The group Lasso is a penalized regression method, used in regression problems where the covariates are partitioned into groups to promote sparsity at the group level [27]. Quantile group Lasso, a natural extension of quantile Lasso [25], is a good alternative when the data has group information and has many outliers and/or heavy tails. How to discover important features that are correlated with interest of outcomes and immune to outliers has been paid much attention. In many applications, however, we may also want to keep the flexibility of selecting variables within a group. In this paper, we develop a sparse group variable selection based on quantile methods which select important covariates at both the group level and within the group level, which penalizes the empirical check loss function by the sum of square root group-wise L1-norm penalties. The oracle properties are established where the number of parameters diverges. We also apply our new method to varying coefficient model with categorial effect modifiers. Simulations and real data example show that the newly proposed method has robust and superior performance.",2014,Journal of Applied Statistics
SVD-Based Screening for the Graphical Lasso,"The graphical lasso is the most popular approach to estimating the inverse covariance matrix of highdimension data. It iteratively estimates each row and column of the matrix in a round-robin style until convergence. However, the graphical lasso is infeasible due to its high computation cost for large size of datasets. This paper proposes Sting, a fast approach to the graphical lasso. In order to reduce the computation cost, it efficiently identifies blocks in the estimated matrix that have nonzero elements before entering the iterations by exploiting the singular value decomposition of data matrix. In addition, it selectively updates elements of the estimated matrix expected to have nonzero values. Theoretically, it guarantees to converge to the same result as the original algorithm of the graphical lasso. Experiments show that our approach is faster than existing approaches.",2017,
Primi dati sulla reintroduzione della starna (Perdix Perdix L.) in un'area protetta della Toscana meridionale,"RIASSUNTO Il presente lavoro riporta i risultati di un progetto di reintroduzione della Starna (Perdix perdix L.) in unâ€™area protetta (Z.R.C.) di 1.032 ha della Toscana meridionale. Lâ€™esperienza giunta al quarto anno di sperimentazione ha mostrato come sia difficoltoso ricostituire delle popolazioni selvatiche di questa specie partendo da soggetti allevati in cattivita. Annualmente sono stati immessi fra i 300 ed i 500 animali per un totale complessivo di 1.600. Si sono registrate densita primaverili comprese fra 5,7 e 7,3 individui per kmq. Il successo riproduttivo e variato fra il 27,7 ed il 66,7%. Il numero di piccoli per nidiata e risultato compreso fra 3,1 e 5,1. La densita delle brigate estive e risultata compresa fra 0,9 ed 1,9 per kmq. Lâ€™Analisi di Vitalita della Popolazione (PVA) ha messo in luce che, con i parametri demografici medi attuali, in assenza di nuove immissioni, la popolazione studiata e destinata ad una probabile estinzione. Tuttavia un miglioramento del 10% del successo riproduttivo sembra sufficiente ad invertire la tendenza. Lâ€™immigrazione di almeno 5 coppie per anno sembra invece un fattore decisivo per la sopravvivenza della specie. Le indicazioni gestionali che si ricavano riguardano lâ€™adozione di specifiche misure di miglioramento ambientale e di controllo dei predatori per migliorare la sopravvivenza e la riproduzione. Inoltre appare opportuno estendere il progetto ad aree protette limitrofe per consentire lâ€™immigrazione di nuovi soggetti. Allo stato attuale comunque, per evitare il collasso della popolazione, e consigliabile prudenzialmente continuare lâ€™immissione di soggetti di allevamento. SUMMARY Results of a 4 years reintroduction project of Grey partridge (Perdix perdix L.) in a protected area (1.032 ha) of southern Tuscany are reported. The experience shows the difficulty of restoring a wild population using farm-reared birds. Annually was released between 300-500 partridges (1.600 total). Spring density resulted between 5,7 and 7,3 birds for sq. km. Breeding success varied from 22,7 and 66,7%. Brood dimension resulted between 3,1 an 5,1. Broods density varied from 0,9 and 1,9 for sq. km. Population Viabilty Analysis (PVA) has shown few survival possibilities of the reintroduced population with the actual demographic parameters in absence of restocking, but a 10% improvement of breeding success seems sufficient to chance negative tendency. Annual immigration of 5 couples seems to have a strong positive effect on population survival. Habitat improvement and predator control should be effective management strategies to improve survival and breeding success. Furthermore it is advisable to release partridges also in other protected area in the nearest. It should allow immigration of new couples. Prudentially, to avoid collapse of population, it is needed to continue farmreared birds supplementation.",2003,
A sparsity-controlled vector autoregressive model.,"Vector autoregressive (VAR) models constitute a powerful and well studied tool to analyze multivariate time series. Since sparseness, crucial to identify and visualize joint dependencies and relevant causalities, is not expected to happen in the standard VAR model, several sparse variants have been introduced in the literature. However, in some cases it might be of interest to control some dimensions of the sparsity, as e.g. the number of causal features allowed in the prediction. To authors extent none of the existent methods endows the user with full control over the different aspects of the sparsity of the solution. In this article, we propose a versatile sparsity-controlled VAR model which enables a proper visualization of potential causalities while allows the user to control different dimensions of the sparsity if she holds some preferences regarding the sparsity of the outcome. The model coefficients are found as the solution to an optimization problem, solvable by standard numerical optimization routines. The tests performed on both simulated and real-life time series show that our approach may outperform a greedy algorithm and different Lasso approaches in terms of prediction errors and sparsity.",2017,Biostatistics
Spectral Dynamic Causal Modelling of Resting-State fMRI: Relating Effective Brain Connectivity in the Default Mode Network to Genetics,"We conduct a novel imaging genetics study with the goal of examining how effective brain connectivity is related to genetics within the context of dementia. Our study develops an analysis examining a sample obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and genetic data obtained from 112 subjects, where each subject is classified as either cognitively normal (CN), as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or as having Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) is fit to the rs-fMRI time series in the spectral domain (spectral DCM) in order to estimate a directed network representing effective brain connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), a key network commonly known to be active when the brain is at rest. These networks are then used as a phenotype and related to a set of genetic markers potentially related to disease using the Bayes factor, where the set of markers is selected based on a genome-wide association study. Our exploratory analysis reveals a potential path of aligned connections within the network being studied forming a path from the medial prefrontal cortex to the right intraparietal cortex through the left right intraparietal cortex that is potentially associated with a genetic signal from chromosome 11. In a separate analysis examining the influence of genetics on disease, this same genetic signal is selected as potentially associated with the probability of Alzheimer's Disease using LASSO penalized multinomial logistic regression. Our analysis serves to motivate a number of further studies with the goal of replicating our findings in a larger sample size and with the goal of expanding the network of brain regions included in the network.",2019,arXiv: Neurons and Cognition
Functional Linear Models for Brain Data,"Background. Modern neuroimaging data has provided a much needed window into the intricacies of the human brain. Neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), often contain many thousands of functional observations per subject. While some success has been had using heuristical summary statistics of neuroimaging functional covariates to build predictive models, there is a lack of a flexible and principled framework to build models from neuroimaging techniques. Aim. Our aim is to develop a general, principled framework for supervised learning that scales to many thousands of neuroimaging functional covariates per subject without resorting to heuristical summary statistics. In particular, we look to more accurately regress a subjectâ€™s age given neuroimaging data through the use of functional covariates than previous approaches that considered only summary statistics. Data. Diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired from a total of 90 subjects. The subjects ranged in age from 13 to 60 years old, and included 45 males and 45 females. The subjects had no known history of neurological or mental disorder. We used per-voxel functional covariates of diffusion orientation distribution functions (dODFs) in our models and real-valued fractional anisotropy (FA) summary statistic covariates as a baseline. dODFs are functions that represent the amount of water molecules, or spins, undergoing diffusion in different orientations over the S sphere. FA values are the peak of the dODF and have previously been used as a summary statistic of dODFs for age regression. In total, 25K voxels were considered in a shared template-space. Methods. We develop and empirically test a linear functional model for neuroimaging data. We use a model that represents neuroimaging functional observations nonparametrically using orthonormal basis projections. The age response is modelled as a sparse additive linear combination of inner products. We show that our model may be optimized using a group-LASSO approach. Results. Our functional sparse linear model was able to predict age with a 29.15% lower mean squared error (MSE) than previous heuristic-based methods that used summary statistics. Our approach yielded an MSE of 58.49. Results were found to be statistically significant with a pvalue of 0.04 using a paired t-test. Conclusions. In this work we have developed and tested a principled framework for building predictive supervised models with functional neuroimaging data. This framework allows one to use functional neuro-data in a statistically principled fashion without resorting to heuristical summary statistics.",2016,
Jean-Jacques Rousseau gramatÃ³logo,"EnglishAn analysis about Jean-Jacques Rousseauï¿½s contribution to the theory of writing and the grammatology. This analysis contains a systematic comparison of the rousseaunian ideas about the language and the writing with another theories of the 17th (Arnauld and Lancelot), 18th (Condillac, Paillasson, Jaucourt) and 20th centuries (Saussure). The contrast of Rousseauï¿½s ideas to Saussureï¿½s about writing also, allows to make explicit Rousseauï¿½s grammatological ideasï¿½s big importance and his relation with the grammatology (Gelb, Derrida, Harris), exceeding avant la lettre modern linguisticsï¿½s phonocentrism. francaisUne analyse de l?apport de Jean- Jacques Rousseau a la theorie de l?ecriture et a la grammatologie.

Research in Africa,Since its creation ANRS has sought to conduct AIDS research in Africa despite the frequently inadequate technical conditions and economic problems of African health systems and the shortage of French medical teams experienced in tropical medicine. Much basic biological research on AIDS takes place in the laboratories of developed countries using samples from Africa. The ANRS conducts clinical and epidemiological research and studies of individuals in society to help in understanding particular aspects of AIDS pathology and epidemiology in Africa. From 1989 to 1995 37 studies were conducted by ANRS teams in Africa. 13 studies concerned the individual in society including social and economic aspects reactions to AIDS and studies of sexuality and migration. 11 studies examined tuberculosis infectious pneumopathies vertical transmission and other medical aspects. Six studies concerned serologic problems specific to Africa four were strictly epidemiologic and three concerned viral strains observed in specific countries. Studies on HTLV 1 were conducted in Gabon and Zaire. In 1993 Coordinated Action no. 12 (AC12) was established and most ANRS research in Africa now is under its authority. One goal of AC12 was to regroup research activities in Africa into a small number of sites that could be provided with sufficient resources for effective action. The three current sites are Abidjan Brazzaville and Dakar. The large number of qualified specialists and foreign medical researchers and a specialized laboratory and modern hospital made possible with French assistance make the Ivory Coast a potentially effective site for clinical research. A center for clinical research on AIDS in Bobo Dioulasso Burkina Faso will cooperate with the Abidjan center. A new hospital financed through French aid has made clinical research possible in Brazzaville despite difficult conditions. Senegal is relatively less affected by the epidemic but HIV l coexists with HIV 2 and HIV 1 may spread in coming years. The countrys well equipped medical facilities will aid future research.,1995,
Communication-efficient Sparse Regression,"We devise a communication-efficient approach to distributed sparse regression in the high-dimensional setting. The key idea is to average ""debiased"" or ""desparsified"" lasso estimators. We show the approach converges at the same rate as the lasso as long as the dataset is not split across too many machines, and consistently estimates the support under weaker conditions than the lasso. On the computational side, we propose a new parallel and computationally-efficient algorithm to compute the approximate inverse covariance required in the debiasing approach, when the dataset is split across samples. We further extend the approach to generalized linear models.",2017,J. Mach. Learn. Res.
"Relation between nutritional status, the outcome of infection and immune responses","A causal interaction between nutrition and the outcome of different infections has been known since long time ago. Moreover, responses of human beings to infection are diverse and demarcated by immunity. A deficient and unappropriated nutrition allows to a deficient immune response. The dynamic interconnection between nutrition, immunity and the outcome of infection creates a cycle. If one of these states is altered, the proper balance of a healthy system will varnish. The purpose of this thesis is to introduce studies that reflect this interaction by exploring both, epidemiological and experimental settings. The first cross-sectional, epidemiological study showed a considerable prevalence of overweight and obesity in school children from Caranavi, a community that represented the Bolivian Lowlands. As for the Highlands, Taraco community remained opposite, with higher prevalence of undernourishment and even stunting, while overweight and obesity were not that prevalent. Remarkably, anemia was found highly prevalent in children from Taraco, compared to lower numbers in Caranavi. More than half of both populations showed vitamin D insufficiency. This study showed increased anaemia, nutritional deficiencies, and indications of poor hygienic conditions in highlands compared with lowlands. Intestinal nematodes modulate immune responses in the context of secondary infection and vaccination. Several mechanisms have been proposed for a possible suppressive effect. In the second study, it was shown that chronic nematode infection leads to reduced peripheral responses to vaccination because of a generalized reduction in the available responsive lymphocyte pool. In detail, it was shown that superficial skin-draining lymph nodes (LNs) in infected mice with the intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus, have an altered lymphocyte composition and less cellularity than uninfected mice upon subsequent BCG infection in the skin. Moreover, B cells and T cells were also lower in skin draining LN. Notably, de-worming and time improved lymphocyte cellularity in LNs and restored Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) responses in the draining LN of the footpad injection site, concluding that chronic nematode infection leads to a paucity of lymphocytes in distal lymph nodes that reduces the efficacy of peripheral immune responses. Obesity can lead to diabetes. Moreover, diabetes increases the risk of developing tuberculosis (TB), but the underlying mechanisms in the tuberculosis-diabetes (TB-DM) co-morbidity are not well defined. This study analyzed the susceptibility to Mycobaterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in a diabetic mice model and focused in the role of HIF-1Î±, a main regulator of metabolic and inflammatory responses, in the outcome of Mtb infection under hyperglycemia and diabetic models. It was observed that mycobacterial infection of macrophages (BMM) or mice increased the expression of HIF-1Î±-regulated glut1 and vegfa genes. Interestingly, incubation of BMM with deferoxamine (DFO), a HIF-1Î± stabilizer, increased levels of HIF-1Î±-regulated immune and metabolic transcripts in both mycobacteria-infected and uninfected BMM. Moreover, M. tuberculosis load was reduced in DFO-incubated BMM. Hyperglycemic conditions reduced the expression of glut1, vegfa, inos and il1b mRNA in mycobacteria infected BMM and DFO treatment reversed this effect. In line with this, M. tuberculosis levels were higher, and HIF-1Î± responses reduced in lungs from db/db mice. DFO-treated mice had increased levels of HIF-1Î±-regulated transcripts in infected organs, and reduced M. tuberculosis load in lungs. These findings suggest that an increase of HIF-1Î± function can improve the control of infection with M. tuberculosis during DM. Altogether, these studies, although diverse, support the importance of the link between nutrition, immune responses and the outcome of two different infections.

Finding new microbial secondary metabolites,"Some bacteria harbor many so-called silent or cryptic gene clusters that arenâ€™t active under typical lab conditions. Secondary metabolites produced by these gene clusters, ones not directly involved in bacterial growth and development, could be a rich source of new medicines, but researchers need to find those metabolites first. To do that, Mohammad R. Seyedsayamdost and coworkers at Princeton University combine a technique called high-throughput elicitors screening with imaging mass spectrometry (Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019, DOI: 10.1038/s41589-018-0193-2). In this method, the researchers use small molecules to turn on silent gene clusters and identify the resulting metabolites with imaging mass spectrometry. The advantage of the new method is that the metabolites themselves rather than genetic assays are the readout. It works with sequenced and unsequenced bacteria. Using this approach, the Princeton team identified one of the smallest lasso peptides ever reported and two new families of glycopeptides, kerati...",2019,Chemical & Engineering News

Jurassic spore-pollen assemblages from Normandy (France) and Germany,"Abstract The spore-pollen contents of 100 samples representing all Jurassic Stages from various localities in France and Germany are examined here. These assemblages consist of 47 species of 30 spore genera and 25 species of 15 gymnosperm pollen genera. All the genera are diagnosed formally and their species described. Various assemblages of some taxa appear to be useful in recognizing several stratigraphic intervals within European Jurassic sediments. Chasmatosporites hians, Duplexisporites scanicus and Quadraeculina annellaeformis are restricted within the Lias. Various species of Araucariacites, Callialasporites, Cerebropollenites, Classopollis, Exesipollenites , and several bisaccate pollen dominate Bathonian and Callovian assemblages.",1987,Geobios
Multivariate rational regression and its application in semiconductor device modeling,"Physics equation-based semiconductor device modeling is accurate but time and money consuming. The need for studying new material and devices is increasing so that there has to be an efficient and accurate device modeling method. In this paper, two methods based on multivariate rational regression (MRR) for device modeling are proposed. They are single-pole MRR and double-pole MRR. The two MRR methods are proved to be powerful in nonlinear curve fitting and have good numerical stability. Two methods are compared with OLS and LASSO by fitting the SMIC 40 nm MOS-FET Iâ€“V characteristic curve and the normalized mean square error of Single-pole MRR is \begin{document}$3.02 \times {10^{{\rm{ - }}8}}$\end{document} which is 4 magnitudes less than an ordinary least square. The Iâ€“V characteristics of CNT-FET and performance indicators (noise factor, gain, power) of a low noise amplifier are also modeled by using MRR methods. The results show MRR methods are very powerful methods for semiconductor device modeling and have a strong nonlinear curve fitting ability.",2018,Journal of Semiconductors
Comparison between single-marker analysis using Merlin and multi-marker analysis using LASSO for Framingham simulated data,"We compared family-based single-marker association analysis using Merlin and multi-marker analysis using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for the low-density lipoprotein phenotype at the first visit for all 200 replicates of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 Framingham simulated data sets. Using ""answers,"" we selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 22 for comparison of results between single-marker and multi-marker analyses. For the major causal SNP rs2294207 on chromosome 22, both single-marker and multi-marker analyses provided similar results, indicating the importance of this SNP. For the 12 polygenic SNPs on the same chromosome, both single-marker and multi-marker analyses failed to provide statistically significant associations, indicating that their effects were too weak to be detected by either method. The main difference between the two methods was that for the 14 SNPs near the causal SNPs, p-values from Merlin were the next smallest, whereas LASSO often excluded these non-causal neighboring SNPs entirely from the first 10,000 models.",2009,BMC Proceedings
â€˜â€˜Per opera della magia neraâ€™â€™. Lâ€™attualitÃ  di una metafora di Karl Kraus nello studio dei rapporti tra informazione e spettacolo,"At the height of his legendary attack on the press, Karl Kraus (1874-1936) used an alienating metaphor in his writings several times that compared the newspapersâ€™ effect on Viennese society to â€œBlack Magicâ€. This image was broadly developed in an essay published in his magazine The Torch in December 1912, significantly entitled The End of the World through Black Magic. Here, in his style â€“ at once grotesque and apocalyptic â€“ the writer presages the immense tragedy that would soon devastate Europe. The essayâ€™s content and tone anticipate the structural themes and typical elements of his great dramatic masterpiece, The Last Days of Mankind, written during and after World War I, containing his revolutionary description of the nature of the conflict, focusing on those not at the front, who â€˜fightâ€™ through the news published in the newspapers. This essay analyses the function of the â€œBlack Magicâ€ metaphor in Krausâ€™s writings and contextualizes it in historical and anthropological terms in view of a mimetic theory, in order to assess its significance and usefulness as a tool for interpreting some of the phenomenological functions of the media in the international crisis. Kraus sees â€œBlack Magicâ€ as a technique, involving phrases and preconceived representations repeated like mantras and disseminated by the media, for controlling the fears and desires of the masses, taking advantage of their innate characteristics and sacrificial nature. As Roberto Calasso remarks in the stage directions to The Last Days of Mankind about the news arriving from the front, the expression â€œThey are gathering in groupsâ€ often recurs, referring to those who make these clusters of people do it in obedience to an â€œofficially powerless, essentially persecutory power: the pressâ€. They crowd frantically around an empty space: â€œlong ago there â€“ Rene Girard reminds us â€“ you could see the tortured body of the victim of the original lynchingâ€.",2016,Comunicacion Y Sociedad
Forecasting Dollar Real Exchange Rates and the Role of Real Activity Factorsâˆ—,"We propose factor-based out of sample forecasting models for US dollar real exchange rates. We estimate latent common factors employing an array of data dimensionality reduction approaches that include the Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Squares, and the LASSO for a large panel of 125 monthly frequency US macroeconomic time series data. We augment two benchmark models, a stationary autoregressive model and the random walk model, with estimated common factors to formulate out-of-sample forecasts of the real exchange rate. Empirical findings demonstrate that our factor augmented models outperform the benchmark models at longer horizons when factors are extracted from real activity variables excluding financial sector variables. Factors obtained from financial market variables overall play a limited role in forecasting. Our data-driven models tend to perform better than models with international factors that are motivated by exchange rate determination theories.",2019,
"New and cryptic species of intertidal mites (Acari, Oribatida) from the Western Caribbean â€“ an integrative approach","ABSTRACT The present study highlights the distribution, systematics, morphology, genetics, and ecology of two newly discovered intertidal oribatid mites from the Western Caribbean. The fortuyniid Litoribates floridae sp. nov. represents a cryptic species as it looks nearly identical to L. bonairensis. The two species can be distinguished only by subtle morphological and morphometric characteristics, whereas cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene sequences clearly separate the two taxa. The absence of morphological divergence in these disjunct species may have resulted from stabilizing selection due to the extreme intertidal environment. Litoribates floridae sp. nov. is presently known from the Florida Keys, primarily in mangrove leaf litter. The selenoribatid Thalassozetes balboa sp. nov. can be distinguished from all known congeners by a unique cuticular notogastral pattern, the presence of only two pairs of adanal setae, and two ventral teeth on each leg claw. It is morphologically most similar to T. barbara from the Eastern Caribbean. Thalassozetes balboa sp. nov. was found in Panama and Florida. This species usually occurs on rocky substrate and feeds on the intertidal alga Bostrychia.

Diverting Ileostomy Set Removable without Laparotomy â€“ Feasibility Study,"We constructed an ileostomy set that creates a diverting ileostomy not requiring surgery for closure. The set has two primary components: a double-balloon drainage catheter and a plastic holder. The plastic holder has a rotary component that is used to tighten a percutaneosly placed lasso-loop stitch and purse the enterotomy after the drainage catheter is removed. We tested the ileostomy set in 10 experimental pigs. The drainage catheter was introduced transcecally into the terminal ileum behind Bauhinâ€™s valve, and the balloon was inflated. Three to seven days later the drainage catheter was removed, and the cecotomy was closed by percutaneous tightening of the lasso-loop stitch. One week later each animal underwent relaparotomy, and we examined the abdominal cavity for peritonitis. An ileocecal resection was performed, and specimens were collected and evaluated microscopically to ensure that the catheter had not damaged the intestinal wall. The only change noted in the terminal ileum was submucosa lymphatic tissue hyperplasia. No intestinal leaks occurred, and percutaneous enterotomy closure was successful.",2006,European Surgical Research
Covariance selection and estimation via penalised normal likelihood,"We propose a nonparametric method to identify parsimony and to produce a statistically efficient estimator of a large covariance matrix. We reparameterise a covariance matrix through the modified Cholesky decomposition of its inverse or the one-step-ahead predictive representation of the vector of responses and reduce the nonintuitive task of modelling covariance matrices to the familiar task of model selection and estimation for a sequence of regression models. The Cholesky factor containing these regression coefficients is likely to have many off-diagonal elements that are zero or close to zero. Penalised normal likelihoods in this situation with L1 and L2 penalties are shown to be closely related to Tibshiraniâ€™s (1996) LASSO approach and to ridge regression. Adding either penalty to the likelihood helps to produce more stable estimators by introducing shrinkage to the elements in the Cholesky factor, while, because of its singularity, the L1 penalty will set some elements to zero and produce interpretable models. An algorithm is developed to compute the estimator and select the tuning parameter. The proposed maximum penalised likelihood estimator is illustrated using simulation and a real dataset involving estimation of a 102 Ã— 102 covariance matrix.",2005,
L-RBF: A Customer Churn Prediction Model Based on Lasso + RBF,"With the development of market economic, customer churn prediction play a critical role in the company management. How-ever, customer information is complex, it contains multi-dimensional features. What's worse, the number of customer churn very small among the whole consumers, and the features of customer are dynamically changing, which is challenging for traditional statistical methods. Fortunately, as the rise of edge computing, more computing related to data-intensive applications will be de-centralized to edge smart terminals. Moreover, edge computing focuses on real-time, short-cycle analysis, which is useful for dealing with dynamic changes problems in customer features. Therefore, to address these issues about customer messages, this paper proposes a simple and effective model to predictive customer churn with a higher accuracy, named L-RBF. The basic idea is to utilize Lasso Regression algorithm (Lasso) for optimizing Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF). At first, placing customer features on edge terminals, and Lasso is utilized to extract the correlated features of customer churn. Then, according to the correlated features and lasso regression equation, we can automatically set the topology and parameter information of RBF. Finally, experimental results indicate that L-RBF has a higher recall rate and stronger prediction classification ability compared with the previous work, included Logistic Regression (Log-R), RBF and Boosting.",2019,"2019 International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)"

Predicting hypoxia status using a combination of contrast-enhanced computed tomography and [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography radiomics features.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Hypoxia is a known prognostic factor in head and neck cancer. Hypoxia imaging PET radiotracers such as 18F-FMISO are promising but not widely available. The aim of this study was therefore to design a surrogate for 18F-FMISO TBRmax based on 18F-FDG PET and contrast-enhanced CT radiomics features, and to study its performance in the context of hypoxia-based patient stratification.


METHODS
121 lesions from 75 head and neck cancer patients were used in the analysis. Patients received pre-treatment 18F-FDG and 18F-FMISO PET/CT scans. 79 lesions were used to train a cross-validated LASSO regression model based on radiomics features, while the remaining 42 were held out as an internal test subset.


RESULTS
In the training subset, the highest AUC (0.873Â±0.008) was obtained from a signature combining CT and 18F-FDG PET features. The best performance on the unseen test subset was also obtained from the combined signature, with an AUC of 0.833, while the model based on the 90th percentile of 18F-FDG uptake had a test AUC of 0.756.


CONCLUSION
A radiomics signature built from 18F-FDG PET and contrast-enhanced CT features correlates with 18F-FMISO TBRmax in head and neck cancer patients, providing significantly better performance with respect to models based on 18F-FDG PET only. Such a biomarker could potentially be useful to personalize head and neck cancer treatment at centers for which dedicated hypoxia imaging PET radiotracers are unavailable.",2018,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology
Chemical corrosion of highly radioactive borosilicate nuclear waste glass under simulated repository conditions,"This review summarizes the results of the joint Japanese (Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, CRIEPI, Tokyo), Swiss (National Cooperative for the Storage of Radioactive Waste, NAGRA, Baden), Swedish (Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company, SKB, Stockholm) international JSS' project on the determination of the chemical durability of the French nuclear waste borosilicate glass, which was completed in 1988. Radioactive and non-radioactive glass specimens were investigated. A data base was created with results from glass corrosion tests performed with different water compositions, pH values, temperatures, sample surface areas ({ital S}), solution volumes ({ital V}), and flow rates. Glass corrosion tests were performed with and without bentonite and/or steel corrosion products present. Variation of the glass composition was taken into account by including the borosilicate glass MW' in the investigations, formulated by British Nuclear Fuels, plc. An understanding was achieved of the glass corrosion process in general, and of the performance of the French glass under various potential disposal conditions in particular. A special effort was made to establish a corrosion data base, using high {ital S}/{ital V} ratios in the experiments in order to understand the glass durability in the long term. A computer program, GLASSOL, was developed,moreÂ Â» based on a dissolution-precipitation model, to calculate the glass water reaction. Fair agreement between observations and the model calculations was achieved. Use of a constant (time-independent) long-term rate was justified by observations on naturally altered basaltic glasses of great age, which were compatible with what was inferred from experiments with nuclear waste glasses in the laboratory. A fractured glass block would not be altered within 10 000 years at 90 {degree}C (flow rate {lt}100 L/year).Â«Â less",1990,Journal of Materials Research
â„“asso MPC: Smart regulation of over-actuated systems,"In this paper, a novel MPC strategy is proposed, and referred to as â€œâ„“asso MPCâ€. The new paradigm features an â„“1-regularised least squares loss function, in which the control error variance competes with the sum of input channels magnitude (or slew rate) over the whole horizon length. This cost choice is motivated by the successful development of LASSO theory in signal processing and machine learning. In the latter fields, â€œsum-of-norms regularisationâ€ have shown a strong capability to provide robust and sparse solutions for system identification and feature selection. In this paper, a discrete-time dual-mode â„“asso MPC is formulated, and its stability is proven by application of standard MPC arguments. The controller is then tested for the problem of ship course keeping and roll reduction with rudder and fins, in a directional stochastic sea. Simulations show the â„“asso MPC to inherit positive features from its corresponding regressor: extreme reduction of decision variables' magnitude, namely, actuators' magnitude (or variations), with a finite energy error, being particularly promising for over-actuated systems.",2012,2012 American Control Conference (ACC)

An Efficiency Revaluation of Graph Labeling for subClassOf Inference based on OWLJessKB Inference Rules,"It is an important research problem to speedily inference large OWL data. As an effort for this problem, some graph labeling techniques for OWL data have been studied like XML labeling techniques. However, the former studies for graph labeling gave their idea in the level of DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) into which OWL data are simplified. They could not consider OWL inference rules based on OWL Semantics like the entailment rules of RDF Semantics. OWLJessKB developed in Drexel University is representing many OWL inference rules in Hom clause based Jess language. However, OWLJessKB is incomplete. In this paper, based on the actually used OWL inference rules, we reevaluate the efficiency of graph labeling for subClassOf inference.

Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Method for Composite Regularization,"Regularized risk minimization often involves nonsmooth optimization. This can be particularly challenging when the regularizer is a sum of simpler regularizers, as in the overlapping group lasso. Very recently, this is alleviated by using the proximal average, in which an implicitly nonsmooth function is employed to approximate the composite regularizer. In this paper, we propose a novel extension with accelerated gradient method for stochastic optimization. On both general convex and strongly convex problems, the resultant approximation errors reduce at a faster rate than methods based on stochastic smoothing and ADMM. This is also veried experimentally on a number of synthetic and real-world data sets.",2014,

"Risk factors for acute human brucellosis in Ijara, north-eastern Kenya","Brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease globally, with particularly high burdens in pastoral settings. While the zoonotic transmission routes for Brucella spp. are well known, the relative importance of animal contact, food-handling and consumption practices can vary. Understanding the local epidemiology of human brucellosis is important for directing veterinary and public health interventions, as well as for informing clinical diagnostic decision making. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Ijara District Hospital, north-eastern Kenya. A total of 386 individuals seeking care and reporting symptoms of febrile illness were recruited in 2011. Samples were tested for the presence of Brucella spp. using a real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and results compared to those from the test for brucellosis used at Ijara District Hospital, the febrile Brucella plate agglutination test (FBAT). A questionnaire was administered to all participants and risk factors for brucellosis identified using logistic regression with an information theoretic (IT) approach and least absolute shrinkage and selection (LASSO). Sixty individuals were RT-PCR positive, resulting in a prevalence of probable brucellosis of 15.4% (95% CI 12.0-19.5). The IT and LASSO approaches both identified consuming purchased milk as strongly associated with elevated risk and boiling milk before consumption strongly associated with reduced risk. There was no evidence that livestock keepers were at different risk of brucellosis than non-livestock keepers. The FBAT had poor diagnostic performance when compared to RT-PCR, with an estimated sensitivity of 36.6% (95% CI 24.6-50.1) and specificity of 69.3% (95% CI 64.0-74.3). Brucellosis is an important cause of febrile illness in north-eastern Kenya. Promotion of pasteurisation of milk in the marketing chain and health messages encouraging the boiling of raw milk before consumption could be expected to lead to large reductions in the incidence of brucellosis in Ijara. This study supports the growing evidence that the FBAT performs very poorly in the diagnosis of brucellosis.",2020,PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
Constrained Sparse Functional Connectivity Networks for MCI Classification,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is difficult to diagnose due to its subtlety. Recent emergence of advanced network analysis techniques utilizing resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) has made the understanding of neurological disorders more comprehensively at a whole-brain connectivity level. However, inferring effective brain connectivity from fMRI data is a challenging task, particularly when the ultimate goal is to obtain good control-patient classification performance. Incorporating sparsity into connectivity modeling can potentially produce results that are biologically more meaningful since most biologically networks are formed by a relatively few number of connections. However, this constraint, when applied at an individual level, will degrade classification performance due to inter-subject variability. To address this problem, we consider a constrained sparse linear regression model associated with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Specifically, we introduced sparsity into brain connectivity via l1-norm penalization, and ensured consistent non-zero connections across subjects via l2-norm penalization. Our results demonstrate that the constrained sparse network gives better classification performance than the conventional correlation-based network, indicating its greater sensitivity to early stage brain pathologies.",2012,Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Why Roman law? Danish arguments for the study of Roman law,"Roman law as such never had any force in Denmark. However, this does not mean that one has not reflected on the importance of Roman law. The theme of this small contribution is centred on arguments in Denmark which have justified the study of Roman law in a Danish context.
On a stone set in the gateway of the town of Rendsborg on the river Ejder you could read ""Eidora Romani terminus imperii"". The river was at the same time the border of the Holy Roman Empire and the borderline between national law and Roman law. This fact did not preclude Roman law from having played an important role in the development of Danish law and especially Danish legal science. In his magisterial work, Medio Evo del Diritto, Francesco Calasso used the phrase ""Corpus juris numquam receptum instar legis sed loco artis juris"", taken from the German knight Besold and framed in the sixteenth century. The concepts of ius commune and ius proprium are useful also to analyse the situation in Denmark. However, in the Nordic Middle Ages it was especially canon law that was important.",2010,Fundamina: a Journal of Legal History

Representing the Hierarchy of Industrial Taxonomies in OWL: The gen/tax Approach,"Existing taxonomies are valuable input for creating ontologies, because they reflect some degree of community consensus and contain, readily available, a wealth of concept definitions plus a hierarchy. However, the transformation of such taxonomies into useful ontologies is not as straightforward as it appears, because simply taking the hierarchy of concepts, which was originally developed for some external purpose other than ontology engineering, as the subsumption hierarchy using rdfs:subClassOf can yield useless ontologies. In this paper, we (1) illustrate the problem by analyzing OWL and RDF-S ontologies derived from UNSPSC (a products and services taxonomy), (2) detail how the interpretation and representation of the original taxonomic relationship is an important modeling decision when deriving ontologies from existing taxonomies, (3) propose a novel â€œgen/taxâ€ approach to capture the original semantics of taxonomies in OWL, based on the split of each category in the taxonomy into two concepts, a generic concept and a taxonomy concept, and (4) show the usefulness of this approach by transforming eCl@ss into a fully-fledged products and services ontology.",2005,
Use of Wishart Prior and Simple Extensions for Sparse Precision Matrix Estimation,"A conjugate Wishart prior is used to present a simple and rapid procedure for computing the analytic posterior (mode and uncertainty) of the precision matrix elements of a Gaussian distribution. An interpretation of covariance estimates in terms of eigenvalues is presented, along with a simple decision-rule step to improve the performance of the estimation of sparse precision matrices and associated graphs. In this, elements of the estimated precision matrix that are zero or near zero can be detected and shrunk to zero. Simulated data sets are used to compare posterior estimation with decision-rule with two other Wishart-based approaches and with graphical lasso. Furthermore, an empirical Bayes procedure is used to select prior hyperparameters in high dimensional cases with extension to sparsity.",2016,PLoS ONE
Angiotensin converting enzyme of Thalassophryne nattereri venom.,"Animal venoms are complex mixtures, including peptides, proteins (i.e., enzymes), and other compounds produced by animals in predation, digestion, and defense. These molecules have been investigated regarding their molecular mechanisms associated with physiological action and possible pharmacological applications. Recently, we have described the presence of a type of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the venom of Thalassophryne nattereri. It is a zinc-dependent peptidase with a wide range of effects. By removing dipeptide His-Leu from terminal C, the ACE converts angiotensinI (AngI) into angiotensin II (AngII) and inactivates bradykinin, there by regulating blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. The fractionation of T. nattereri venom in CM-Sepharose indicated a peak (CM2) with angiotensin-converting activity, converting AngI into Ang II. Electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel (12%) revealed one band with 30kDa for CM2 similar in size to natterins, which are toxins with proteolytic activity found in T. nattereri venom. Mass spectrometry indicated that the protein sequence of the ACE purified from T. nattereri venom corresponds to natterin 1. The isolated protein has also demonstrated inhibition through captopril and EDTA and is characterized as a classic ACE. Thus, the isolated enzyme purified from T. nattereri venom is the first ACE isolated from fish venom.",2016,International journal of biological macromolecules
Evaluation of logistic Bayesian LASSO for identifying association with rare haplotypes,"It has been hypothesized that rare variants may hold the key to unraveling the genetic transmission mechanism of many common complex traits. Currently, there is a dearth of statistical methods that are powerful enough to detect association with rare haplotypes. One of the recently proposed methods is logistic Bayesian LASSO for case-control data. By penalizing the regression coefficients through appropriate priors, logistic Bayesian LASSO weeds out the unassociated haplotypes, making it possible for the associated rare haplotypes to be detected with higher powers. We used the Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 simulated data to evaluate the behavior of logistic Bayesian LASSO in terms of its power and type I error under a complex disease model. We obtained knowledge of the simulation model, including the locations of the functional variants, and we chose to focus on two genomic regions in the MAP4 gene on chromosome 3. The sample size was 142 individuals and there were 200 replicates.Despite the small sample size, logistic Bayesian LASSO showed high power to detect two haplotypes containing functional variants in these regions while maintaining low type I errors. At the same time, a commonly used approach for haplotype association implemented in the software hapassoc failed to converge because of the presence of rare haplotypes. Thus, we conclude that logistic Bayesian LASSO can play an important role in the search for rare haplotypes.",2014,BMC Proceedings
A U-statistic estimator for the variance of resampling-based error estimators,"We revisit resampling procedures for error estimation in binary classification in terms of U-statistics. In particular, we exploit the fact that the error rate estimator involving all learning-testing splits is a U-statistic. Therefore, several standard theorems on properties of U-statistics apply. 
In particular, it has minimal variance among all unbiased estimators and is asymptotically normally distributed. Moreover, there is an unbiased estimator for this minimal variance if the total sample size is at least the double learning set size plus two. In this case, we exhibit such an estimator which is another U-statistic. It enjoys, again, various optimality properties and yields an asymptotically exact hypothesis test of the equality of error rates when two learning algorithms are compared. Our statements apply to any deterministic learning algorithms under weak non-degeneracy assumptions. 
In an application to tuning parameter choice in lasso regression on a gene expression data set, the test does not reject the null hypothesis of equal rates between two different parameters.",2013,arXiv: Statistics Theory
"Predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgeryâ€”a cross-disciplinary approach combining physiological, social, and psychological measures","Bariatric surgery leads to a substantial weight loss (WL), however, a subset of patients undergoing surgery fails to achieve adequate WL. The reason for the individual variation in WL remains unexplained. Using an exploratory cross-disciplinary approach, we aimed to identify preoperative and early postoperative factors explaining the variation in WL after bariatric surgery. Sixty-one subjects were recruited. Eighteen subjects did not receive surgery and three subjects dropped out, leaving a total sample of 40 subjects. Physiological, social, and psychological data were collected before and 6 months after surgery. All variables were analyzed in combination using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to explain the variation in WL 18 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (nâ€‰=â€‰30) and sleeve gastrectomy (nâ€‰=â€‰10). Mean WL was 31% (range: 10â€“52%). The following preoperative factors predicted 59% of the variation in WL: type of surgery (14%), diabetes status (12%), economic resources (9%), sex (7%), binge eating disorder (7%), degree of depression (5%), household type (3%), and physical activity (1%). Including information on early responses after surgery increased the ability to predict WL to 78% and was explained by early WL (47%), changes in energy density of food consumed from a buffet meal (9%), changes in glicentin (5%), degree of depression (5%), sex (5%), type of surgery (2%), economic resources (2%), and changes in drive for thinness (1%). Using a cross-disciplinary approach, a substantial part of the individual variation in WL was explained by a combination of basic patient characteristics, psychological profile, and social conditions as well as physiological, psychological and behavioral responses to surgery. These results suggest that patient characteristics collected in a cross-disciplinary approach may help determine predictors for less successful WL after bariatric surgery. If verified in larger cohorts this may form the basis for individualized postoperative support to optimize WL outcome.",2020,International Journal of Obesity

Accelerated Stochastic ADMM for Empirical Risk Minimization,"Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is a popular method in solving Machine Learning problems. Stochastic ADMM was firstly proposed in order to reduce the per iteration computational complexity, which is more suitable for big data problems. Recently, variance reduction techniques have been integrated with stochastic ADMM in order to get a fast convergence rate, such as SAG-ADMM and SVRG-ADMM,but the convergence is still suboptimal w.r.t the smoothness constant. In this paper, we propose a new accelerated stochastic ADMM algorithm with variance reduction, which enjoys a faster convergence than all the other stochastic ADMM algorithms. We theoretically analyze its convergence rate and show its dependence on the smoothness constant is optimal. We also empirically validate its effectiveness and show its priority over other stochastic ADMM algorithms. T he Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), firstly proposed by Gabay and Mercier [1976], Glowinski and Marroco [1975], is an efficient and versatile tool, which can always guarantee good performance when handling large-scale data-distributed or big-data related problems, due to its ability of dealing with the objective functions separately and synchronously. Recent studies have shown that ADMM has a convergence rate of O(1/N) (where N is the number of iterations) for general convex problems He and Yuan [2012a,b], Monteiro and Svaiter [2013]. Therefore, ADMM has been widely applied to solve machine learning problems in real world, such as lasso, SVM Boyd et al. [2011],group lasso Meier et al. [2008], graph guided SVM Ouyang et al. [2013], and top ranking Kadkhodaie et al. [2015]. All these can be easily casted into an Empirical Risk Minimization(ERM) framework. That is",2016,
Life on the edge: Coral reef fishes exhibit strong responses to a habitat boundary,"Habitat edges commonly support discrete communities compared to adjoining habitats in response to unique boundary conditions. Coral reefs are often adjacent to other habitats, e.g. sand or seagrass meadows, but little is known about how reef-associated organisms respond to the presence of edges. Here, we examined fish communities and benthic assemblages at varying distance from a coral reef-sand edge. At 25 sites, 30 m transects were placed at 5 locations: 1 along the edge and at 5 m and 10 m away from the edge into reef and sand habitats. Counts were made of 51 fish species and benthic composition surveyed. The fish community along the edge was substantially different to communities only 5 m into the sand and reef habitats. Overall, 61% of the 51 fish species appeared to respond to the edge, with 43% significantly higher or lower in abundance along the edge compared to other locations. Twelve species showed positive edge responses, including the wrasse Thalassoma lunare, which was 30 times more abundant along the edge compared to 10 m into the reef. Ten species exhibited negative edge responses, including the damselfish Pomacentrus moluccensis, which was 7 times more abundant 10 m into the reef compared to the edge. Feeding ecology appears to influence edge-related distribution patterns, with carnivores and omnivores dominating the edges and planktivores more abundant into the reef. These findings suggest that habitat edges may play an important role in structuring coral reef fish communities. Future research should focus on experimental approaches to identify the underlying mechanisms driving edge responses.",2016,Marine Ecology Progress Series
SeleÃ§Ã£o de modelos multinÃ­veis para dados de avaliaÃ§Ã£o educacional,"COELHO, F. R. Selection of multilevel models for educational evaluation data. 2017. 173 p.

When a dataset contains a hierarchical data structure, a possible approach is the multilevel regression modelling, which is justified by the significative amout of the data variability that can be explained by macro level processes. In this work, a selection of multilevel regression models for educational data is developed. This analysis is divided into two parts: variable selection and model selection. The latter is subdivided into two categories: classical and Bayesian modeling. Traditional criteria for model selection such as Lasso, AIC, BIC, and WAIC, among others are used in this study as an attempt to identify the factors influencing ninth grade studentsâ€™ performance in Mathematics of elementary education in the State of SÃ£o Paulo. Likewise, an investigation was conducted to evaluate the performance of each variable selection criteria and model selection methods applied to fitted models that will be mentioned throughout this work. It was possible to conclude that, under the frequentist approach, BIC is the most efficient, whereas under the bayesian approach, WAIC presented better results. Using Lasso under the frequentist approach, a decrease of 34% on the number of predictors was observed. Finally, we identified that the performance in Mathematics of students in the ninth year of elementary school in the state of SÃ£o Paulo is most influenced by the following covariates: motherâ€™s educational level, frequency of book reading, time spent with recreation in classroom, the fact of liking Math, school global performance in Mathematics, performance in Portuguese, school administrative dependence, gender, fatherâ€™s educational degree, failures and age-grade distortion.",2017,
Variable Selection in Nonparametric and Semiparametric Regression Models,"This chapter reviews the literature on variable selection in nonparametric and semiparametric regression models via shrinkage.

Asymptotic behaviour of a dynamic local field: is the order of the k to infinity and omega to infinity limits interchangeable in an interacting many-body system?,The wavevector- and frequency-dependent susceptibility chi k( omega ) in many-body theory is customarily expressed in terms of a dynamic local field term Gk( omega ). For k to infinity there are certain asymptotic forms for Gk( omega ) due to Shaw (1970) and to Niklasson (1974). It is shown that they represent the two different orders of the k to infinity and omega to infinity limits. The validity of the result is tested in an exactly solvable physical system.,1989,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter
Estimation of the Spatial Weighting Matrix for Spatiotemporal Data under the Presence of Structural Breaks,"In this paper, we propose a two-step lasso estimation approach to estimate the full spatial weights matrix of spatiotemporal autoregressive models. In addition, we allow for an unknown number of structural breaks in the local means of each spatial locations. The proposed approach jointly estimates the spatial dependence, all structural breaks, and the local mean levels. In addition, it is easy to compute the suggested estimators, because of a convex objective function resulting from a slight simplification. Via simulation studies, we show the finite-sample performance of the estimators and provide a practical guidance, when the approach could be applied. Eventually, the invented method is illustrated by an empirical example of regional monthly real-estate prices in Berlin from 1995 to 2014. The spatial units are defined by the respective ZIP codes. In particular, we can estimate local mean levels and quantify the deviation of the observed prices from these levels due to spatial spill over effects.",2018,arXiv: Computation
On the sign recovery given by the thresholded LASSO and thresholded Basis Pursuit,"We consider the regression model, when the number of observations is smaller than the number of explicative variables. It is well known that the popular Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) can recover the sign of regression coefficients only if a very stringent irrepresentable condition is satisfied. In this article, in a first step, we provide a new result about the irrepresentable condition: the probability to recover the sign with LASSO is smaller than 1/2 once the irrepresentable condition does not hold. Next, we revisit properties of thresholded LASSO and provide new theoretical results in the asymptotic setup under which the design matrix is fixed and the magnitudes of nonzero regression coefficients tend to infinity. Apart from LASSO, our results cover also basis pursuit, which can be thought of as a limiting case of LASSO when the tuning parameter tends to 0. Compared to the classical asymptotics, our approach allows for reduction of the technical burden. We formulate an easy identifiability condition which turns out to be sufficient and necessary for thresholded LASSO to recover the sign of the sufficiently large signal. Our simulation study illustrates the difference between the irrepresentable and the identifiability condition. Interestingly, while irrepresentable condition becomes more difficult to be satisfied for strongly correlated designs, it does not seem to be true for identifiability condition. Actually, when the correlations are positive and the nonzero coefficients are of the same sign, the identifiability condition allows the number of nonzero coefficients to be larger than in case where the regressors are independent.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
A Hierarchical Integrative Group LASSO (HiGLASSO) Framework for Analyzing Environmental Mixtures,"Environmental health studies are increasingly measuring multiple pollutants to characterize the joint health effects attributable to exposure mixtures. However, the underlying dose-response relationship between toxicants and health outcomes of interest may be highly nonlinear, with possible nonlinear interaction effects. Existing penalized regression methods that account for exposure interactions either cannot accommodate nonlinear interactions while maintaining strong heredity or are computationally unstable in applications with limited sample size. In this paper, we propose a general shrinkage and selection framework to identify noteworthy nonlinear main and interaction effects among a set of exposures. We design hierarchical integrative group LASSO (HiGLASSO) to (a) impose strong heredity constraints on two-way interaction effects (hierarchical), (b) incorporate adaptive weights without necessitating initial coefficient estimates (integrative), and (c) induce sparsity for variable selection while respecting group structure (group LASSO). We prove sparsistency of the proposed method and apply HiGLASSO to an environmental toxicants dataset from the LIFECODES birth cohort, where the investigators are interested in understanding the joint effects of 21 urinary toxicant biomarkers on urinary 8-isoprostane, a measure of oxidative stress. An implementation of HiGLASSO is available in the higlasso R package, accessible through the Comprehensive R Archive Network.",2020,arXiv: Methodology
SpHMC: Spectral Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,"Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) methods have been widely used to sample from certain probability distributions, incorporating (kernel) density derivatives and/or given datasets. Instead of exploring new samples from kernel spaces, this piece of work proposed a novel SGHMC sampler, namely Spectral Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SpHMC), that produces the high dimensional sparse representations of given datasets through sparse sensing and SGHMC. Inspired by compressed sensing, we assume all given samples are low-dimensional measurements of certain high-dimensional sparse vectors, while a continuous probability distribution exists in such high-dimensional space. Specifically, given a dictionary for sparse coding, SpHMC first derives a novel likelihood evaluator of the probability distribution from the loss function of LASSO, then samples from the high-dimensional distribution using stochastic Langevin dynamics with derivatives of the logarithm likelihood and Metropolisâ€“Hastings sampling. In addition, new samples in low-dimensional measuring spaces can be regenerated using the sampled high-dimensional vectors and the dictionary. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm using real-world datasets. The performance comparisons on three real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of SpHMC beyond baseline methods.",2019,

Systematics of Poecilia mexicana (Pisces: Poeciliidae) in Northern Mexico,"structure of the digital tips (basis for generic separation of Niceforonia). E. elassodiscus and E. nigrovittatus are structurally intermediate between the two species of Niceforonia and the widespread, lowland E. binotatus complex in the characteristics of digital morphology. All of these species share the following character states: 1) first finger longer than second, 2) skin of venter smooth, 3) nasal bones in median contact and 4) frontoparietals complete with no frontoparietal fontanelle. The structural intermediacy of E. elassodiscus and E. nigrovittatus suggests evolutionary intermediacy as well.",1973,Copeia
"On the distribution of penalized maximum likelihood estimators: The LASSO, SCAD, and thresholding","We study the distributions of the LASSO, SCAD, and thresholding estimators, in finite samples and in the large-sample limit. The asymptotic distributions are derived for both the case where the estimators are tuned to perform consistent model selection and for the case where the estimators are tuned to perform conservative model selection. Our findings complement those of Knight and Fu (2000) and Fan and Li (2001). We show that the distributions are typically highly nonnormal regardless of how the estimator is tuned, and that this property persists in large samples. An impossibility result regarding estimation of the estimators' distribution function is also provided.",2009,J. Multivar. Anal.
Consistent long-term spatial gradients in replenishment for an island population of a coral reef fish,"The population replenishment of marine organisms is routinely characterized as highly variable and unpredictable in space and time. Using island-wide recruitment surveys of a common coral reef fish, the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum, in 6 summers spanning a 12 yr period (1991 to 2003), we examined whether spatial patterns of recruitment are consistent or variable through time on St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. Despite annual fluctuations in the magnitude of replen- ishment, recruitment intensity follows a distinct and consistent spatial gradient that differs in direc- tion between the north (leeward) and south (windward) shores; recruitment declines from west to east on the north shore and east to west on the south shore. The rank ordering of sites on each shore was concordant when recruitment was either pooled across years (monthly variation) or pooled across months (annual variation). When the 2 highest recruitment sites on each shore were consid- ered alone, consistent seasonal effects were also apparent, with higher recruitment from June through August on the north shore, and higher recruitment in September on the south shore. Thus, while the magnitude of recruitment is indeed variable in space and time, its qualitative pattern is pre- dictable in this area. Results of prior investigations of larval dispersal and coastal oceanography around St. Croix shed light on the origin of the consistent recruitment patterns documented in this study. The potential for consistent spatial and temporal patterns in recruitment is an important con- sideration in the spatial management of marine resources.",2006,Marine Ecology Progress Series
Palynomorph succession of the Upper Pliensbachian-Lower Toarcian of the Peniche section (Portugal) SucessÃ£o de palinomorfos ao longo do Pliensbaquiano superior - Toarciano inferior no perfil de Peniche (Portugal),"The Peniche section in the Lusitanian Basin (western Portugal) provides an exceptional, continuous record of the Portuguese Lower Jurassic, and is the candidate for the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point for the base of the Toarcian. This paper reports a palynological study of the Margaritatus, Spinatum, Polymorphum and Levisoni zones. Forty eight levels yielded representative and well preserved palynomorph assemblages. Fifty seven palynomorph taxa were recorded: 19 spore taxa, 20 pollen taxa, 11 acanthomorph acritarchs, 4 prasinophytes and 3 dinocyst taxa. The Pliensbachian levels show a characteristic predominance of Classopollis and a wide diversity of aquatic palynomorphs. The Toarcian levels are characterised by the pollen grains of Spheripollenites and a progressive reduction in the diversity of aquatic palynomorphs.",2013,
A safe reinforced feature screening strategy for lasso based on feasible solutions,"Abstract As a popular method in machine learning, lasso performs regression and feature selection simultaneously. However, for large datasets, the training efficiency of lasso remains a challenge. Recently, an Enhanced screening rule via Dual Polytope Projection (EDPP) was proposed to substantially reduce the scale of lasso by deleting inactive features beforehand. However, EDPP may mistakenly discard active features in practice due to the unavailable optimal solutions. To solve this problem, a safe reinforced feature screening rule based on EDPP and feasible solutions (S-EDPP) is introduced in this paper. By utilizing feasible solutions and estimating a proper upper bound of the deviation, S-EDPP can be guaranteed to be safe both in theory and in practice. Theoretical analysis of the deviation term in S-EDPP is given to verify its efficiency. Furthermore, S-EDPP is also extended to accelerate the Elastic Net, which is a corrective method of lasso. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets verify that S-EDPP is a safe modification of EDPP and it gives superior performance than other existing safe rules.",2019,Inf. Sci.
"A urine-based DNA methylation assay, ProCUrE, to identify clinically significant prostate cancer","BackgroundPrevention of unnecessary biopsies and overtreatment of indolent disease remains a challenge in the management of prostate cancer. Novel non-invasive tests that can identify clinically significant (intermediate-risk and high-risk) diseases are needed to improve risk stratification and monitoring of prostate cancer patients. Here, we investigated a panel of six DNA methylation biomarkers in urine samples collected post-digital rectal exam from patients undergoing prostate biopsy, for their utility to guide decision making for diagnostic biopsy and early detection of aggressive prostate cancer.ResultsWe recruited 408 patients in risk categories ranging from benign to low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer from three international cohorts. Patients were separated into 2/3 training and 1/3 validation cohorts. Methylation biomarkers were analyzed in post-digital rectal exam urinary sediment DNA by quantitative MethyLight assay and investigated for their association with any or aggressive prostate cancers.We developed a Prostate Cancer Urinary Epigenetic (ProCUrE) assay based on an optimal two-gene (HOXD3 and GSTP1) LASSO model, derived from methylation values in the training cohort, and assessed ProCUrEâ€™s diagnostic and prognostic ability for prostate cancer in both the training and validation cohorts.ProCUrE demonstrated improved prostate cancer diagnosis and identification of patients with clinically significant disease in both the training and validation cohorts. Using three different risk stratification criteria (Gleason score, Dâ€™Amico criteria, and CAPRA score), we found that the positive predictive value for ProCUrE was higher (59.4â€“78%) than prostate specific antigen (PSA) (38.2â€“72.1%) for all risk category comparisons. ProCUrE also demonstrated additive value to PSA in identifying GS â‰¥â€‰7 PCa compared to PSA alone (DeLongâ€™s test pâ€‰=Â 0.039), as well as additive value to the PCPT risk calculator for identifying any PCa and GS â‰¥â€‰7 PCa (DeLongâ€™s test pâ€‰=â€‰0.011 and 0.022, respectively).ConclusionsProCUrE is a promising non-invasive urinary methylation assay for the early detection and prognostication of prostate cancer. ProCUrE has the potential to supplement PSA testing to identify patients with clinically significant prostate cancer.",2018,Clinical Epigenetics
