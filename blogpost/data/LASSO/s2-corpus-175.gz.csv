Crossing the Bridge: The Role of Lived Experiences in Shaping Noncredit Workforce Education Students' Educational Goals.,"The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of students enrolled in noncredit workforce education programs as preparation for ongoing education. Ten students enrolled in a noncredit welding class were interviewed and the interview transcripts were subjected to analytic induction. Notable findings indicate that students were greatly influenced by the expectations and support of their families and teachers. Findings also illustrate that students generally complete high school and that career and technical education programs are important to student success. Students primarily desire job skills and certification with credentials. Findings in this study will increase higher education leaders' knowledge of a vital and growing body of students within an important division of community colleges. Additional findings and implications are included. Introduction The community college has become a crossroads of learning, an educational waypoint for workforce training and retraining (Grubb & Lazerson, 2004; Jacobs & Voorhees, 2006). Individuals seeking employment-based education may transit a college's campus multiple times seeking a variety of outcomes (Grubb, Badway, & Bell, 2003; Jacobs & Voorhees, 2006). Such training most likely appeals to students' professional or financial motivations since studies have demonstrated that workforce training (Galasso, Ravallion, & Salvia, 2004) and college-employer workforce training collaborations (Hawley, Sommers, & Melendez, 2005) have beneficial effects on wages. While the professional and financial value of noncredit workforce education may be established, there remains the question of its academic worth in encouraging further education. Background As millions of students enroll in community colleges to obtain work-related knowledge (Jacobs & Dougherty, 2006), Grubb, Badway, and Bell (2003) observed that community colleges' noncredit workforce training may serve an important role by creating a bridge for unlikely and underserved students to higher educational pathways. The authors classified the current state of noncredit workforce education as training dead ends that ""lead to nowhere"" (p. 233). Thus, the best workforce service colleges could do for underserved, low-wage, low-skill, and nontraditional students would be to advance them toward degree-seeking status or outcomes that might lead to greater employment opportunities. If Grubb et al. (2003) were correct in suggesting that lower-division schools should serve a precollege role in ushering low-wage or low-skilled workers into higher educational echelons, then it stands to reason that colleges that fully comprehend the abilities and desires of this population of potential students stand a greater chance of assisting and assimilating them. Included among these characteristics may be the students' desired training outcomes, future expectations, and confidence in their own learning efficacy (Norman & Hyland, 2003). However, despite the accessibility of community colleges to myriad students of all stations in life (Grubb et al., 2003), the relationship between outcomes from noncredit workforce education and that education's overall impact on students' lives does not seem to be well documented or understood (Bragg, 2002; Milam, 2005; Seybert, 2002; Van Noy, Jacobs, Korey, Bailey, & Hughes, 2008). Understanding these students may begin with understanding their motivation. Norman and Hyland (2003) observed that a major component in student learning was the student's own disposition--including their sense of efficacy--toward education and learning. Thus, one possible starting point in understanding the educational aspirations of these noncredit students might be to explore how students' lived experiences shape their academic self-efficacy and expectations. Such an understanding might enable educators to fully comprehend how to better serve these students and offer more access to students in all walks of life. â€¦",2012,The Community College Enterprise
Performance Issues with IEEE 802,"Although 802.11 was initially designed for infrastructure-based networks, the distributed coordination function allows mobiles to access the radio medium without the need for a base station. Thus, studies in wireless multihop networks, also called ad hoc networks, often rely on the use of IEEE 802.11 for the physical and MAC layers. However, for a couple of years the use of 802.11 in ad hoc networks has been discussed. Different scenarios show serious performance issues. The performance offered by 802.11 is often low and directly impacts the performance of higher-layer protocols. In this article we provide a summary of the different performance issues extracted so far. We classify basic situations according to the main effects. We then present a quick survey of the possible solutions to these problems. This classification is intended to help design appropriate MAC protocols dedicated to ad hoc networks.

IEEE Communications Magazine â€¢ July 2005 111 As collision detection is not possible due to the half-duplex characteristic of the wireless interfaces, each unicast frame has to be acknowledged. When a receiver successfully receives a frame, it waits for a short interframe space (SIFS) and then emits the acknowledgment. The SIFS is much shorter than the DIFS in order to give priority to acknowledgments over data frames. The emitter treats the lack of reception of an acknowledgment as a collision. When an erroneous frame is detected at the MAC level (due to collisions or transmission errors), emitters will defer their transmission of an extended interframe space (EIFS) interval time instead of a DIFS, when the medium becomes idle. This timing is much larger than the DIFS and sufficient to protect acknowledgment transmission. The reception of an errorfree frame during the EIFS wait cancels this long wait mechanism. To prevent a hidden node situation in which two independent emitters simultaneously send a frame to the same receiver, an optional request to send (RTS)/clear to send (CTS) exchange can be used. Before transmitting a frame, the emitter asks the receiver if the medium is free in its vicinity by emitting an RTS frame. If no interfering transmission is present, the receiver answers by a CTS frame and the transmission can begin. Neighbors of both emitter and receiver overhear these frames and consider the medium reserved for the duration of the transmission, acting as if it was busy for this whole time. This mechanism is called virtual carrier sense. Figure 1 summarizes part of these operations. This figure represents the MAC operations in a network of three nodes in mutual communication range. At the beginning, node A has a frame to send. As the medium is free, it can emit its frame after a DIFS, which is followed by the acknowledgment from B. A then wishes to emit another frame. If the new frame has been enqueued while the previous exchange was taking place, A has to draw a backoff. In this example, a backoff of 2 slots is drawn. In parallel, C also wishes to send a frame to B. As the medium was sensed free, it emits as soon as DIFS is elapsed. Unfortunately, A and C choose the exact same moment to start their emission, and a collision happens at B. As no acknowledgment is sent back, both emitters re-emit their frame, drawing a backoff in a doubled contention window. This time, C wins the contention, and its emission stops the backoff decrementation of A two slots before it finishes. After the data-acknowledgment exchange is finished, A restarts the backoff process with its two remaining slots.",2005,
Lasso procedure to correct finger-clawing in leprosy using index or middle finger flexor digitorum superficialis split into four tails--a long-term follow-up study.,"For obvious reasons, the use of flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) from the ring finger, for correction of finger-clawing, is usually not recommended in leprosy. Hence, one has to choose either index or middle finger FDS for correction of finger-clawing. No significant differences could be made out when follow-up data of claw-finger correction by modified lasso procedure, using FDS either from index or middle finger, were compared. In some hands post-operative problems, such as stiffness, superficialis minus deformities of proximal interphalangeal joints (PIPJ) and distal interphalangeal joints (DIPJ), were noted. As revealed by finger dynamography, the working space of the hand was not found to be fully restored, the donor finger showing distortion of its working space.",2004,Indian journal of leprosy
"Le point sur le conseil liÃ© au dÃ©pistage de lâ€™infection par le VIH Ã  Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","Comment est percu le test de depistage du VIH dans une consultation prenatale a Bobo-Dioulasso au Burkina Faso ? Quelles sont les attitudes des professionnels de la sante et des responsables politiques et religieux face au conseil ? Pour repondre a ces questions, deux approches, lâ€™une quantitative, lâ€™autre qualitative, ont ete adoptees. Cent trente-cinq femmes enceintes, venant en consultation au Centre de sante maternelle et infantile de Farakan a Bobo-Dioulasso, ont ete interrogees individuellement et 96 % dâ€™entre elles ont accepte le principe dâ€™un test de depistage du VIH. Parmi elles, 91 % souhaitaient connaitre le resultat du test, 46 % en presence dâ€™une personne de leur entourage qui etait, dans la majorite des cas, le partenaire ou le conjoint. Huit entretiens approfondis ont ete realises. Quatre informateurs proposaient que soit associee une personne de lâ€™entourage a lâ€™annonce des resultats pour ameliorer la prise en charge des patients. Plusieurs raisons limitant le test de depistage ont ete evoquees : lâ€™absence de prise en charge therapeutique et psychosociale, le cout du test, le manque de confidentialite, les consequences psycho-sociales, la difficulte a communiquer et a changer les comportements. Ces observations pourraient constituer une base de reflexion pour aboutir a un consensus local et national en matiere de conseil lie au depistage de lâ€™infection par le VIH au Burkina Faso.",1996,
"Bmp Receptors Specific for Op-1 Are Identified in Human Normal, Degenerative and Oa Cartilage","protein expression for type I and II OP-1 receptors. By using antibodies against these receptors (BMPR-II, ALK-2, ALK-3 and ALK-6) primarily cellassociated specific immunostaining was found in normal and OA cartilage. The strongest cellular staining in normal cartilage was found in the superficial and upper middle layer chondrocytes, while in OA cartilage cells from the deep layer were also stained positively. Some light matrix staining was detected for type I receptor (more for ALK-2 than for ALK-3) in the superficial and upper middle layer of normal cartilage. The intensity of the interterritorial matrix staining and its distribution were increased in the degenerative and OA cartilage. Similar pattern of immunostaining was observed for BMPR-II. This type II receptor was mostly co-localized with type I receptor. However, in addition, BMPR-II was found also in the territorial matrix of degenerative and OA cartilage. By western blot analysis OP-1 receptors were detected in total cartilage extracts as well as in membrane-enriched fraction. The intensity of immunoreactive bands for type I receptors was higher in OA samples when compared to normal, while the intensity of BMPR-II bands was stronger in normal tissue than in OA. Interestingly, type I OP-1 receptors were present in OA cartilage also in the soluble fraction. In normal adult cartilage by immunofluorescence all receptors were visualized on the membranes of isolated chondrocytes. Comparative analysis of mRNA levels for each receptor type showed that BMPR-II, ALK-2 and ALK-3 message was elevated two-three fold in degenerative tissues (grade II and III) and in OA cartilage. Expression of ALK-6 did not show substantial changes, although some decrease in message was noticed. DISCUSSION. In the current study we report for the first time that all known OP-1 receptors are expressed by human adult normal and OA chondrocytes. We identified both message and the protein for these receptors. As comparative analyses show the levels of mRNA and protein expression as well as protein distribution correlate with the pathophysiological state of the tissue. The strongest staining for OP-1 receptors was found in the upper part of the cartilage indicating their co-localization with the ligand (mature OP-1). The matrix staining for the receptors in the degenerative and OA cartilage and their appearance in the soluble fraction suggest a possible shedding from the cell membrane during process of cartilage degeneration. Importantly, the parallel changes in the message levels for BMPR-II and only for two out of three type I receptors (ALK-2 and ALK-3) indicate, perhaps, the primary involvement of these receptors in OP-1 signaling pathway in human degenerative and OA cartilage. In conclusion, our study confirms that not only the ligand (OP-1) but also its receptors depend on the pathophysiological state of the tissue. This study provides a critical background for further understanding of the role of OP-1 and OP-1 signaling in cartilage homeostasis under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",2001,

Modern Nonparametric Statistics: Going Beyond Asymptotic Minimax,"During the years 1975 1990 a major emphasis in nonparametric estimation was put on computing the asymptotic minimax risk for many classes of functions. Modern statistical practice indicates some serious limitations of the asymptotic minimax approach and calls for some new ideas and methods which can cope with the numerous challenges brought to statisticians by modern sets of data. Mathematics Subject Classification (2000): 62Gxx. Introduction by the Organisers The workshop took place during the period March 28 April 2 and, as usual, talks were planned from Monday morning to Friday morning (most participants leaving on Friday afternoon) with a break on Wednesday afternoon for the traditional walk to Saint-Roman. There were finally 48 participants, due to some late cancellations. Unfortunately, Iain Johnstone could not attend the meeting since he had a very important committment in the US with the NSF during that week. However, he could participate quite actively in the organization up to the last minute since we, organizers, had the opportunity to meet together during a previous workshop and also exchange extensively by e-mail through which the list of participants and talks and all final details were set up. Therefore we were really three organizers and the success of the meeting should be put on the three of us. Actually, the list of speakers and the schedule of the talks were ready before our arrival and only minor changes 884 Oberwolfach Report 16/2010 were made during that week. This precise schedule can be found at the end of our report. During the years 1975 1990 (roughly speaking) a major emphasis in nonparametric estimation was put on computing the (possibly asymptotic) minimax risk for many classes of functions, starting from the simplest Holder classes to the more sophisticated Besov balls in the beginning of the 90â€™s. It was clear, at that time, that this minimax point of view was quite pessimistic, since it was directed towards the worse case and also unrealistic, since one never knows to which smoothness class (or other specific class) the true parameter does belong. Nevertheless, this approach allowed to design useful estimators, which could be more or less practically calibrated (by cross-validation for instance) and provided some benchmarks for the performance of a given method. Then, by the beginning of the 90â€™s (approximately), started an important movement towards what is now called adaptation, either to some smoothness class or to the specific function that was to be estimated. This was made via different tools like Lepskiâ€™s method, the use of localized basis and thresholding, model selection . . . More recently, many new methods (aggregation of estimators, Lasso, etc.) appeared in order to cope with the numerous challenges brought to statisticians by modern sets of data and the huge progress of computing : huge data sets or situations where the number of unknown parameters is much larger than the number of data, together with some sparsity assumption. This also coincides with an important renewal of Bayesian methods due to much better and powerful computing facilities. Workshop organization In view of the importance of the numerous new techniques that are presently studied and used to solve the challenges offered by the modern sets of data, we decided that the main purpose of the workshop would be to expose many young researchers to those new techniques. We invited a number of confirmed specialists and experts together with younger professionals, PhD. students, postdocs, new assistant professors, in order to get a mix of generations and experiences. We also selected 5 senior professors to give longer talks (one hour and a half, one each morning) in order to develop their subject. These persons were especially asked, several months before the workshop, to deliver these special conferences. We also spent a lot of time and discussion in order to select the talks among the proposals by the participants in order to keep a maximal coherence between the subjects and keep the level as high as possible, finally limiting the number of talks to 24, including the five major ones mentioned above, and avoiding the multiplication of short talks. All normal talks were of 45mn, with the exception of the last morning since it was asked to us by the MFO organization to shorten the session for an early lunch (apparently for Easter vacation). It was also an occasion for us to invite an unusually large number of participants (mostly young researchers and some more senior French) that visited the MFO for Modern Nonparametric Statistics: Going Beyond Asymptotic Minimax 885 the first time, which gave them an occasion to discover this very nice place, the wonderful library, the numerous working facilities and the excellent MFO organization (as usual). We tried, as much as possible, to organize our 8 sessions around themes like Model Selection, Adaptive Density Estimation, High-dimensional Data and Sparsity, Statistics for Processes, Nonparametric Bayesian Methods, with also some talks by young and promising researchers which were given exactly the same time as the more senior ones.

"Thalassobaculum salexigens sp. nov., a new member of the family Rhodospirillaceae from the NW Mediterranean Sea, and emended description of the genus Thalassobaculum.","A novel Gram-negative bacteria, named CZ41_10a(T), was isolated from coastal surface waters of the north-western Mediterranean Sea. Cells were motile, pleomorphic rods, 1.6 mum long and 0.7 mum wide and formed cream colonies on marine agar medium. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 65 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the new isolate in the genus Thalassobaculum, a member of the family Rhodospirillaceae, class Alphaproteobacteria. Unlike Thalassobaculum litoreum CL-GR58(T), its closest relative, strain CZ41_10a(T) was unable to grow anaerobically and did not exhibit nitrate reductase activity. On the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization, fatty acid content and physiological and biochemical characteristics, this isolate represents a novel species for which the name Thalassobaculum salexigens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CZ41_10a(T) (=DSM 19539(T)=CIP 109604(T)=MOLA [corrected] 84(T)).

Sparsification of Linear Models for Large-Scale Text Classification,In this paper we propose a simple yet effective method for sparsifying a posteriori linear models for large-scale text classification. The objective is to maintain high performance while reducing the prediction time by producing very sparse models. This is especially important in real-case scenarios where one deploys predictive models in several machines across the network and constraints apply on the prediction time. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach in a large collection of documents from the Large-Scale Hierarchical Text Classification Challenge. The comparison with a feature selection method and LASSO regularization shows that we achieve to obtain a sparse representation improving in the same time the classification performance.,2015,

Back tting algorithms for total-variation and empirical-norm penalized additive modeling with high-dimensional data,"Additive modeling is useful in studying nonlinear relationship between a response and covariates. We develop back tting algorithms to implement the doubly penalized method in Tan & Zhang (2017), using total-variation and empirical-norm penalties. Use of the total-variation penalty leads to an automatic selection of knots for each component function, whereas use of the empirical-norm penalty can result in zero solutions for component functions and hence facilitates component selection in high-dimensional settings. For a back tting cycle, each component function is updated by thresholding a solution to a Lasso problem, which is computed using an active-set descent method. Screening rules are also derived to determine zero solutions without solving the Lasso problem directly. We present numerical experiments to demonstrate the e ectiveness of the proposed algorithms for linear and logistic additive modeling. Copyright c 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2018,
Variable Selection Methods with Applications to Crime Prediction,"There have been several variable selection techniques presented in the literature and coursework. However, to date there is no agreed upon â€œbestâ€ approach. In this thesis, we apply several different variable selection techniques to a 1990 United States crime database to determine 1) which set of socio-economic and demographic factors are most predictive of violent crime, and 2) which model selection technique produces the best out of sample predictions. The selected cleaned data set was split into a training and test sets and stepwise (forÂ­ ward, backward, both forward and backward simultaneously), lasso, elastic net, princiÂ­ pal component regression (PCR), best random subset selection (BRSS), regression trees (full, pruning, bagging, random forest) and count (aggregation of multiple methods) were fit to the training data and then applied to the test data. Fit criteria we used included AIC, BIC, multiple R2, adjusted R2, and mean squared error (MSE). Summary tables and figÂ­ ures detailing which factors were associated with violent crime were constructed as well as tables/figures assessing the performance of the different variable selection techniques. Variables which were associated with violent crime rates across different methods of selection included measures of employment, urbanization/density, income, poverty, ethnicity and family structure. In terms of model selection techniques, the method that produced the highest out of sample R2 was BRSS which also produced an unbiased asÂ­ sessment of model fit when applied to test data. Lasso and elastic net performed similarly, but not quite as well as BRSS. The other methods performed somewhat worse. Predicting crime rates can be difficult, but by using these variable selection techÂ­ niques we found a small subset of variables which seemed to be most associated with",2016,
Infinite mixture-of-experts model for sparse survival regression with application to breast cancer,"BackgroundWe present an infinite mixture-of-experts model to find an unknown number of sub-groups within a given patient cohort based on survival analysis. The effect of patient features on survival is modeled using the Coxâ€™s proportionality hazards model which yields a non-standard regression component. The model is able to find key explanatory factors (chosen from main effects and higher-order interactions) for each sub-group by enforcing sparsity on the regression coefficients via the Bayesian Group-Lasso.ResultsSimulated examples justify the need of such an elaborate framework for identifying sub-groups along with their key characteristics versus other simpler models. When applied to a breast-cancer dataset consisting of survival times and protein expression levels of patients, it results in identifying two distinct sub-groups with different survival patterns (low-risk and high-risk) along with the respective sets of compound markers.ConclusionsThe unified framework presented here, combining elements of cluster and feature detection for survival analysis, is clearly a powerful tool for analyzing survival patterns within a patient group. The model also demonstrates the feasibility of analyzing complex interactions which can contribute to definition of novel prognostic compound markers.",2010,BMC Bioinformatics

Innovative Prozesstechnik zur Mikrobearbeitung von Glas,"Andreas Lemke, Kay Sowoidnich und David AshkenasiDie gemeinnutzige Laser- und Me-dizin-Technologie GmbH, Berlin (LMTB) entwickelt Prozesstechniken und optische Komponenten speziell fur die industrielle Lasermikroferti-gung. Einen Schwerpunkt bildet dabei die Lasermikrobearbeitung von Glas in Starken zwischen 0,05 und 1 mm. Der Einsatz von ultrakurzen Laserpul-sen bietet fur transparente Werkstoffe eine gute Voraussetzung fur eine pra-zise und schonende Herstellung von Bohrungen und Innenmarkierungen. Die Doppelpuls-Technik liefert in Pra-zision und Geschwindigkeit ein weite-res Verbesserungspotenzial.Die Anwendung des Lasers als beruh-rungsloses Werkzeug hat sich im Be-reich der Metallbearbeitung bereits seit langem etabliert und ist ein essentieller Bestandteil moderner Produktions-anlagen. Eine ahnliche Entwicklung lasst sich im Bereich der Bearbeitung von Glasern feststellen, da die Laser-strahlung auch hier zunehmend an Bedeutung gewinnt. Das Anwen-dungsspektrum umfasst neben der Verfeinerung klassischer Applikatio-nen, wie beispielsweise das Glasritzen, auch die Entwicklung neuer Bearbei-tungsmethoden. Insbesondere in den Bereichen Displaytechnologie (Smart-phone, Tablet-PC, Flachbildschirm), Umwelttechnik (Solarzellen) und Bio-technologie (Glas-Wafer mit geringer Autofluoreszenz) zeigen sich stark steigende Umsatze von Flachglasern unterschiedlicher Glassorten und Mate-rialstarken von 0,1 bis 1 mm. Bisher eta-blierte Kunststofftrager werden dabei in zunehmendem Mase von Dunn- bzw. Dunnstglasern verdrangt, da diese eine Reihe technisch vorteilhafter Eigen-schaften (u. a. besserer Barriereschutz, hoherer Warmewiderstand, hohere Transparenz sowie bessere Stabilitat und Langzeitbestandigkeit) aufweisen. Die Flachglaser werden tendenziell dunner und leichter. Zudem variieren die zu erzeugenden Schnittgeometrien und es kommen zunehmend komple-xere Muster zum Einsatz, um auch an-spruchsvollere Designs zu realisieren. Aufgrund dieser Anforderungen aus der Anwendung stosen mechanische Bearbeitungsverfahren (mit Andruck) haufig an ihre Grenzen, was sich an den Ausschussraten und einer Reduzierung der Bearbeitungsgeschwindigkeit be-merkbar macht.Als prominentes Beispiel fur alter-native Prozessverfahren ist hier die Bearbeitung von Glasern mit Nano-sekunden-Laserpulsen im grunen Spektralbereich zu nennen [1]. Auf-grund der (unerwunschten) Warmeein-wirkung im Material lassen sich jedoch keine hochprazisen Strukturen bis in den Mikrometerbereich hinein reali-sieren. Mit Hilfe ultrakurzer Laserpulse hingegen ist es moglich, ungewollte thermische Effekte weitestgehend zu minimieren. In Kombination mit hohen Puls-Spitzenleistungen ergeben sich so sehr gute Voraussetzungen fur die Mikrobearbeitung transparenter Werk-stoffe. Die im Folgenden beschriebenen Untersuchungen konzentrieren sich auf den Einsatz von Laserpulsen mit ei-ner Dauer von wenigen Pikosekunden. Diese Auswahl erfolgte speziell im Hinblick auf eine mogliche Umset-zung neuer Bearbeitungsmethoden, da die Anwendung von Pikosekunden-Laserpulsen seit einigen Jahren als ein-setzbare Schlusseltechnologie fur die industrielle Fertigung akzeptiert wird. Entsprechende Laserverfahren werden bereits in ausgewahlten Anwendungen zur Glasbearbeitung eingesetzt, jedoch bieten die bisherigen einstufigen Ver-fahren, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die Trends in der Dunnglasfertigung, noch Potenzial fur Verbesserungen.",2013,Laser Technik Journal
Bacterial community compositions of propylene oxide saponification wastewater treatment plants,"The activated sludge process has been successfully used to treat propylene oxide (PO) saponification wastewater, which has the characteristics of high chlorine contents (22â€†000â€“26â€†000 mg Lâˆ’1) and high COD (more than 2000 mg Lâˆ’1). Microorganisms, especially bacteria, play an important role in PO saponification wastewater treatment processes. Analysis of the bacterial composition of the aeration tank and contact oxidation tank, the two main components of PO saponification wastewater treatment plants (SWWTP), revealed their significant community difference in municipal and coking wastewater treatment plants. Interestingly, Î²-Proteobacteria was almost absent in the PO SWWTP, which was usually abundant in various bio-treatment systems. In the aeration tank of PO SWWTP, the most abundant genera were Marinobacter, Mesorhizobium, Paracoccus, Devosia, Methylophaga and KSA1. In the contact oxidation tank of PO SWWTP, the most abundant genera were Thalassospira, Marinobacter, Owenweeksia, Novispirillum, Mesorhizobium, Sporotomaculum, Pseudidiomarina and KSA1. We also measured the total components and toxicity of PO saponification wastewater in order to establish correlations between bacterial stains, genes and their treatment capacity. The results indicated that most of the bacteria encoded the dehalogenase gene and played an important role in the dechlorinating process of chlorinated organics in the aeration tank. In contrast, most of the bacteria encode the alkJ gene in the contact oxidation tank, which was involved in the degradation of 2,4-dimethyl-2-pentanol or some dechlorinated intermediate products. This study would provide new insight into the microbial community compositions of PO SWWTPs.",2017,RSC Advances
Basis pursuit for spectrum cartography,"A nonparametric version of the basis pursuit method is developed for field estimation. The underlying model entails known bases, weighted by generic functions to be estimated from the field's noisy samples. A novel field estimator is developed based on a regularized variational least-squares (LS) criterion that yields estimates spanned by thin-plate splines. Robustness considerations motivate well the adoption of an overcomplete set of basis functions, together with a sparsity-promoting regularization term, which endows the estimator with the ability to select a few of these bases that â€œbetterâ€ explain the data. This parsimonious field representation becomes possible because the sparsity-aware spline-based method of this paper induces a group-Lasso estimator of the thin-plate spline basis expansion coefficients. The novel spline-based approach to basis pursuit is motivated by a spectrum cartography application, in which a set of sensing cognitive radios collaborate to estimate the distribution of RF power in space and frequency. Simulated tests corroborate that the estimated power spectrum density atlas yields the desired RF state awareness, since the maps reveal spatial locations where idle frequency bands can be reused for transmission, even when fading and shadowing effects are pronounced.",2011,"2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Regression methods for survival and multistate models,"REGRESSION METHODS FOR SURVIVAL AND MULTI STATE MODELS Farida Mostajabi June 23, 2011 A common research interest in medical, biological, and engineering research is determining whether certain independent variables are correlated with the survival or failure times. Standard statistical techniques cannot usually be applied for failure-time data due to the lack of complete data or in other word, due to censoring. From a statistical perspective, the study of time to event data is even more challenging when further complexities such as high dimensionality or multivariablity is added to the model. In this dissertation, we consider the predicating patient survival from proteomic profile of patient serum using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) data of non-small cell lung cancer patients. Due to much larger dimension of features in a mass spectrum compared to the study sample size, traditional linear regression modeling of survival times with high number of proteomic features is not feasible. Hence, we consider latent factor and regularized/penalized methods for fitting such models in order to predict patient survival from the mass spectrometry features. Extensive numerical studies involving both simulated as well as real mass spectrometry data are used to compare four popular regression methods, namely, partial least squares (PLS), sparse partial least square (SPLS), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and elastic net regularization, on processed spectra. Right censoring is handled",2011,
Pseudoclassical approach to electron and ion density correlations in simple liquid metals,"SummaryElectron-electron and electron-ion structural correlations in simple liquid metals are treated by using effective pair potentials to incorporate quantal effects into a pseudoclassical description of the electron fluid. An effective pair potential between simultaneous electron density fluctuations is first constructed from known properties of the degenerate jellium model, which are the plasmon sum rule, the Kimball-Niklasson relation and Yasuharaâ€™s values of the electron pair distribution function at contact. An analytic expression is theraby obtained in the Debye-HÃ¼ckel approximation for the electronic structure factor in jellium over a range of density appropriate to metals, with results which compare favourably with those of fully quantal evaluations. A simple pseudoclassical model is then set up for a liquid metal: this involves a model of charged hard spheres for the ion-ion potential and an empty-core model for the electron-ion potential, the Coulombic tails being scaled as required by the relation between the long-wave-length partial structure factors and the isothermal compressibility of the metal. The model is solved analytically by a pseudoclassical linear response treatment of the electron-ion coupling and numerical results are reported for partial structure factors in liquid sodium and liquid beryllium. Contact is made for the latter system with data on the electron-electron structure factor in the crystal from inelastic X-ray scattering experiments of Eisenberger Marra and Brown.RiassuntoIl lavoro calcola le correlazioni strutturali tra elettroni e ioni in metalli liquidi mediante uno schema pseudoclassico basato sullâ€™uso di potenziali efficaci. Il potenziale efficace tra elettroni Ã¨ costruito con riferimento al gellio, e permette di ottenere una espressione analitica per la struttura di questo modello che Ã¨ in buon accordo con i risultati di calcoli quantistici. Gli altri potenziali efficaci per il metallo liquido usano modelli noti per i noccioli ionici combinati con la relazione di Ornstein-Zernike tra struttura e compressibilitÃ . Tale modello pseudoclassico del metallo liquido Ã¨ pure risolto analiticamente. Risultati numerici sono ottenuti per la struttura del, sodio e del berillio liquidi e sono confrontati con altri risultati teorici e con dati sperimentali con attenzione particolare al fattore di struttura elettrone-elettrone misurato da Eisenberger, Marra e Brown in esperimenti di diffusione inelastica di raggi X dal berillio cristallino.Ð ÐµÐ·ÑŽÐ¼ÐµÐ Ð°ÑÑÐ¼Ð°Ñ‚Ñ€Ð¸Ð²Ð°ÑŽÑ‚ÑÑ ÑÐ»ÐµÐºÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾Ð½-ÑÐ»ÐµÐºÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾Ð½Ð½Ñ‹Ðµ Ð¸ ÑÐ»ÐµÐºÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾Ð½-Ð¸Ð¾Ð½Ð½Ñ‹Ðµ ÑÑ‚Ñ€ÑƒÐºÑ‚ÑƒÑ€Ð½Ñ‹Ðµ ÐºÐ¾Ñ€Ñ€ÐµÐ»ÑÑ†Ð¸Ð¸ Ð² Ð¿Ñ€Ð¾ÑÑ‚Ñ‹Ñ… Ð¶Ð¸Ð´ÐºÐ¸Ñ… Ð¼ÐµÑ‚Ð°Ð»Ð»Ð°Ñ…, Ð¸ÑÐ¿Ð¾Ð»ÑŒÐ·ÑƒÑ ÑÑ„Ñ„ÐµÐºÑ‚Ð¸Ð²Ð½Ñ‹Ðµ Ð¿Ð°Ñ€Ð½Ñ‹Ðµ Ð¿Ð¾Ñ‚ÐµÐ½Ñ†Ð¸Ð°Ð»Ñ‹, Ñ‡Ñ‚Ð¾Ð±Ñ‹ Ð²ÐºÐ»ÑŽÑ‡Ð¸Ñ‚ÑŒ ÐºÐ²Ð°Ð½Ñ‚Ð¾Ð²Ñ‹Ðµ ÑÑ„Ñ„ÐµÐºÑ‚Ñ‹ Ð² Ð¿ÑÐµÐ²Ð´Ð¾ÐºÐ»Ð°ÑÑÐ¸Ñ‡ÐµÑÐºÐ¾Ðµ Ð¾Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸Ðµ ÑÐ»ÐµÐºÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾Ð½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¶Ð¸Ð´ÐºÐ¾ÑÑ‚Ð¸.

The LASSO linear mixed model for mapping quantitative trait loci,"This thesis concerns the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for important traits in cattle line crosses. One of these traits is birth weight of calves, which affects both animal production and welfare through correlated effects on parturition and subsequent growth. Birth weight was one of the traits measured in the Daviesâ€™ Gene Mapping Project. These data form the motivation for the methods presented in this thesis. Multiple QTL models have been previously proposed and are likely to be superior to single QTL models. The multiple QTL models can be loosely divided into two categories: 1) model building methods that aim to generate good models that contain only a subset of all the potential QTL; and 2) methods that consider all the observed marker explanatory variables. The first set of methods can be misleading if an incorrect model is chosen. The second set of methods does not have this limitation. However, a full fixed effect analysis is generally not possible as the number of marker explanatory variables is typically large with respect to the number of observations. This can be overcome by using constrained estimation methods or by making the marker effects random. One method of constrained estimation is the least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (LASSO). This method has the appealing ability to produce predictions of effects that are identically zero. The LASSO can also be specified as a random model where the effects follow a double exponential distribution. In this thesis, the LASSO is investigated from a random effects model perspective. Two methods to approximate the marginal likelihood are presented. The first uses the standard form for the double exponential distribution and requires adjustment of the score equations for unbiased estimation. The second is based on an alternative probability model for the double exponential distribution. It was developed late in the candidature and gives similar dispersion parameter estimates to the first approximation, but does so in a more direct manner. The alternative LASSO model suggests some novel types of predictors. Methods for a number of different types of predictors are specified and are compared for statistical efficiency. Initially, inference for the LASSO effects is performed using simulation. Essentially, this treats the random effects as fixed effects and tests the null hypothesis that the effect is zero. In simulation studies, it is shown to be a useful method to identify important effects. However, the effects are random, so such a test is not strictly appropriate. After the specification of the alternative LASSO model, a method for making probability statements about the random effects being above or below zero is developed. This method is based on the predictive distribution of the random effects (posterior in Bayesian terminology). The random LASSO model is not sufficiently flexible to model most QTL mapping data.",2006,
How Teachers Make Restructuring Happen.,"Fve years ago we two classoom teachers were dismayed jy the one-stage nature of teaching, where career advancement equals leaving the classroom. We were discouraged to see some of our best colleagues leaving teaching to enter fields as disparate as school administra tion, psychology, and real estate. We were disappointed about the deterio rating quality of the student teachers who came our way. And we were dismayed by the low self-esteem of our special needs students and the fragmen tation they experienced alternating between pull-out programs and the mainstream classroom. How could the profession attract and keep the best and the brightest in teaching? How could we change teaching from a one-stage career to an evolving and challenging one? How could special needs students be better served? And how could we, two teachers, make all this happen? Ulti mately, we knew that to improve the learning opportunities for all students, we had to improve the teaching occu pation.",1992,Educational Leadership
Risk-sensitive foraging does not explain condition-dependent choices in settling reef fish larvae,"The transition from the planktonic larval to the benthic adult stage in reef fishes is perilous, and involves decisions about habitat selection and group membership. These decisions are consequential because they are essentially permanent (many fish rarely leave their initial settlement habitat, at least for the first several days or weeks). In one common Caribbean reef fish, the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), settling larvae either join groups or remain solitary. Grouped fish have lower mortality rates but slightly slower growth rates, and fish that are smaller at the time of settlement are less likely to join groups. We hypothesized that the decision of smaller (i.e., lower condition) fish to remain solitary could be explained by risk-sensitive foraging: with less competition, solitary fish may have higher variance in foraging success, so that there is a chance of a high payoff (outweighing the increased mortality risk) despite the lack of a large difference in the average outcome. We tested this by comparing the mean, standard deviation, and maximum number of (a) prey items in stomach contents and (b) post-settlement growth rates (from otolith measurements) of solitary and grouped fish during two settlement pulses on St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. However, we did not find evidence to support our hypothesis, nor any evidence to support the earlier finding that fish in groups have lower average growth rates. Thus we must consider alternative explanations for the tendency of smaller fish to remain solitary, such as the likely costs of searching for and joining groups at the time of settlement. This study reinforces the value of larval and juvenile fish as a testbed for behavioral decisionmaking, because their recent growth history is recorded in their otoliths.",2020,PeerJ
Complex dynamics of fluids in disordered and crowded environments.,"Over the past two decades, the dynamics of fluids under nanoscale confinement has attracted much attention. Motivation for this rapidly increasing interest is based on both practical and fundamental reasons. On the practical and rather applied side, problems in a wide range of scientific topics, such as polymer and colloidal sciences, rheology, geology, or biophysics, benefit from a profound understanding of the dynamical behaviour of confined fluids. Further, effects similar to those observed in confinement are expected in fluids whose constituents have strong size or mass asymmetry, and in biological systems where crowding and obstruction phenomena in the cytosol are responsible for clear separations of time scales for macromolecular transport in the cell. In fundamental research, on the other hand, the interest focuses on the complex interplay between confinement and structural relaxation, which is responsible for the emergence of new phenomena in the dynamics of the system: in confinement, geometric constraints associated with the pore shape are imposed to the adsorbed fluids and an additional characteristic length scale, i.e. the pore size, comes into play. For many years, the topic has been mostly experimentally driven. Indeed, a broad spectrum of systems has been investigated by sophisticated experimental techniques, while theoretical and simulation studies were rather scarce due to conceptual and computational issues. In the past few years, however, theory and simulations could largely catch up with experiments. On one side, new theories have been put forward that duly take into account the porosity, the connectivity, and the randomness of the confinement. On the other side, the ever increasing available computational power now allows investigations that were far out of reach a few years ago. Nowadays, instead of isolated state points, systematic investigations on the dynamics of confined fluids, covering a wide range of system parameters, can be realized. In fact, theory and simulations were recently able to predict new and surprising dynamical features, such as the occurrence of sub-diffusive laws, which result from the trapping due to the geometric and topological constraints and/or quenched disorder, the presence of both continuous and discontinuous glass transitions, and diffusion-localization transitions. Together, theory and simulations are thus able to contribute to a deeper insight into the complex dynamical behaviour of fluids in disordered confinement. Still, many yet unsolved problems remain. The fact that theoretical and simulation approaches have caught up with experimental investigations, has motivated us to organize a workshop on the dynamics of fluids confined in disordered environments, so as to bring together the different communities working in this field: theory and simulations, with their recent developments based on the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition, and experiments, with particular emphasis on colloidal systems and novel techniques. In an effort to give credit to recent developments in related problems of biophysical relevance, an entire session of the programme was dedicated to anomalous diffusion in crowded environments. The workshop was thus aimed at providing a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of fluids in confinement as well as up-to-date perspectives on the interdisciplinary applications of this field of research. We are proud to say that all 32 contacted speakers accepted our invitation. Additional participants were attracted by our scientific programme, contributing poster presentations to the workshop. In total, close to 50 participants were registered, arriving from 11 different countries (including the US, Japan, and Mexico). Thus we conclude that the workshop indeed addressed a highly topical scientific field. From the scientific point of view a broad range of problems was covered, ranging from biophysics over soft matter to fermion systems. From the vivid discussions it became evident that the close scientific contact between theory, simulation and experiment brought along a fruitful and mutually inspiring atmosphere. On the theoretical side, these discussions have allowed clarification of several connections between the dynamics of models of fluids in porous media (quenched-annealed, pinned particles models), those of well-known limiting cases (Lorentz gas), of realistic models of liquids with strong dynamic asymmetry (asymmetric size and mass mixtures, sodium silicates, polymers blends) and even of bulk glass-formers. On the experimental side, it appeared that soft matter systems may provide an excellent test-bed to verify the theoretical predictions. From the concluding discussion it was also clear that addressing related issues relevant to biology still remains an open challenge for the future. In view of all this, it was concluded that within a short time period a workshop with analogous scope should be organized to address the progress made on both fundamental and interdisciplinary aspects. The realization of this workshop was made possible by generous financial support from CECAM, Centre Blaise Pascal-ENS de Lyon, and the ESF network 'Molecular Simulations in Biosystems and Material Science' (SimBioMa).

Association of Medical Students' Reports of Interactions with the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Industries and Medical School Policies and Characteristics: A Cross-Sectional Study,"BACKGROUND
Professional societies use metrics to evaluate medical schools' policies regarding interactions of students and faculty with the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. We compared these metrics and determined which US medical schools' industry interaction policies were associated with student behaviors.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
Using survey responses from a national sample of 1,610 US medical students, we compared their reported industry interactions with their schools' American Medical Student Association (AMSA) PharmFree Scorecard and average Institute on Medicine as a Profession (IMAP) Conflicts of Interest Policy Database score. We used hierarchical logistic regression models to determine the association between policies and students' gift acceptance, interactions with marketing representatives, and perceived adequacy of faculty-industry separation. We adjusted for year in training, medical school size, and level of US National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. We used LASSO regression models to identify specific policies associated with the outcomes. We found that IMAP and AMSA scores had similar median values (1.75 [interquartile range 1.50-2.00] versus 1.77 [1.50-2.18], adjusted to compare scores on the same scale). Scores on AMSA and IMAP shared policy dimensions were not closely correlated (gift policies, r = 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.44; marketing representative access policies, r = 0.51, 95% CI 0.36-0.63). Students from schools with the most stringent industry interaction policies were less likely to report receiving gifts (AMSA score, odds ratio [OR]: 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.72; IMAP score, OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.19-1.04) and less likely to interact with marketing representatives (AMSA score, OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.69; IMAP score, OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.95) than students from schools with the lowest ranked policy scores. The association became nonsignificant when fully adjusted for NIH funding level, whereas adjusting for year of education, size of school, and publicly versus privately funded school did not alter the association. Policies limiting gifts, meals, and speaking bureaus were associated with students reporting having not received gifts and having not interacted with marketing representatives. Policy dimensions reflecting the regulation of industry involvement in educational activities (e.g., continuing medical education, travel compensation, and scholarships) were associated with perceived separation between faculty and industry. The study is limited by potential for recall bias and the cross-sectional nature of the survey, as school curricula and industry interaction policies may have changed since the time of the survey administration and study analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
As medical schools review policies regulating medical students' industry interactions, limitations on receipt of gifts and meals and participation of faculty in speaking bureaus should be emphasized, and policy makers should pay greater attention to less research-intensive institutions.

"The determination of Middle-Upper Jurassic Ringtor Formation in the Tarezeng area,Tibet,and its geological significance","Pollen fossils such as Classopollis, Annulispora, and Chasmatosporites as well as abundant dinoflagellates like Systematophora cf., and Ctenidodinium, which indicate Middle-Upper Jurassic strata with a typical significance, were found in the formerly-regarded Middle Permian Xiala Formation within the Tarezeng area, Tibet. The findings show that at least part of Middle-Upper Jurassic strata has not been identified previously in the Xiala Formation. The assemblage characteristics of the rock, basic sequence, and fossil comparison show that this set of strata belongs to the Ringtor Formation. The determination of this formation provides basic information for the correlation of regional strata, the establishment of the stratigraphic framework and the investigation of the evolution of the Mesozoic basin.",2015,Geological bulletin of China
Breastfeeding and popular aetiology in the Sahel.,"Two views about breastfeeding and the resumption of intercourse after a birth are found to prevail in Bamako and Bobo-Dioulasso, two cities of the Sahel region of Africa: that sexual relations may spoil the milk; and that a child should be weaned when the woman is pregnant again. Both beliefs provide a rationale to abstain, but the postpartum taboo has been greatly reduced in the area, and the second belief is the most important. 'Bad milk' serves as an explanation for many of the diarrhoeas and diseases of nutritional origin that affect infants and children. Traditional medical treatments of diarrhoea and protein calorie malnutrition are consistent with the popular aetiology. The acceptance of modern techniques of infant care in this area may well be predicated on the diffusion of an alternative model of disease causation.",1991,"Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health"

Evaluation of Heterocyclic Hydrocarbon Degradation by using Immobilized Bacteria,"There are some bacteria known to have the ability to break down heterocyclic hydrocarbon compounds. However, they are not efficient enough to degrade these compounds as the bacteria require a long time to grow, fully degrade hydrocarbon compounds, and the environment for growing bacteria is easily contaminated. Thus, in this study, the bacteria were immobilized and grew inside the gellamgum. The bacteria involved are Thalassospira sp. strain MOI and M155 bacteria which have the ability to degrade Biphenyl (BPH) and Dibenzofuran (DBF) respectively. By immobilizing these bacteria, the rate of degradation is proven to be faster than free bacteria and they can be reused. Furthermore, they are safe from any possible contamination. Immobilization also improves the degrading enzyme induction and reusability of bacteria.",2015,
The MIAmaxent R package: Variable transformation and model selection for species distribution models,"The widely used ""Maxent"" software for modeling species distributions from presence-only data (Phillips et al., Ecological Modelling, 190, 2006, 231) tends to produce models with high-predictive performance but low-ecological interpretability, and implications of Maxent's statistical approach to variable transformation, model fitting, and model selection remain underappreciated. In particular, Maxent's approach to model selection through lasso regularization has been shown to give less parsimonious distribution models-that is, models which are more complex but not necessarily predictively better-than subset selection. In this paper, we introduce the MIAmaxent R package, which provides a statistical approach to modeling species distributions similar to Maxent's, but with subset selection instead of lasso regularization. The simpler models typically produced by subset selection are ecologically more interpretable, and making distribution models more grounded in ecological theory is a fundamental motivation for using MIAmaxent. To that end, the package executes variable transformation based on expected occurrence-environment relationships and contains tools for exploring data and interrogating models in light of knowledge of the modeled system. Additionally, MIAmaxent implements two different kinds of model fitting: maximum entropy fitting for presence-only data and logistic regression (GLM) for presence-absence data. Unlike Maxent, MIAmaxent decouples variable transformation, model fitting, and model selection, which facilitates methodological comparisons and gives the modeler greater flexibility when choosing a statistical approach to a given distribution modeling problem.",2019,Ecology and Evolution

Trophic relationships among Antarctic fulmarine petrels : insights into dietary overlap and chick provisioning strategies inferred from stable-isotope (Î´15N and Î´13C) analyses,"We used stable-isotope analysis (SIA) to evaluate trophic relationships in an Antarctic seabird community. We determined natural abundances of stable-nitrogen (Î´ 15 N) and stable-carbon (Î´ 13 C) isotopes from blood samples (n = 283) from adults and chicks of 4 Antarctic fulmarine petrel species (Fulmarus glacialoides, Thalassoica antarctica, Daption capense and Pagodroma nivea) during 2 consecutive breeding seasons, 1994/1995 and 1995/1996, and from representative prey items. Our objectives were to use the isotope approach to infer trophic status and diet composition within and between species, addressing interspecific and temporal variability within this seabird community, and to investigate potential age-related differences in assumed trophic position within species. Prey Î´ 13 C values ranged from -26.8â€° in amphipods to -23.9%o in adult Antarctic silverfish. Seabird Î´ 13 C values ranged from-25.3â€° in Antarctic petrel chicks to -23.8â€° in cape petrel adults. Prey Î´ 15 N values ranged from 4.0â€° in euphausiids to 10.7 â€° in adult Antarctic silverfish. Seabird Î´ 15 N values ranged from 8.4 â€° in Antarctic petrel adults to 12.0â€° in snow petrel chicks. There was considerable interspecific overlap in assumed trophic positions amongst the 4 petrel species, and we conclude all species consumed fish and krill. Despite this apparent overlap, the range in Î´ 15 N values for petrels corresponded to the equivalent of 1 full trophic level, and estimated trophic level varied with both species and age. A simple trophic level model, constructed based on the Î´ 15 N data, predicted trophic levels ranging from 2.3 in krill to 4.7 in snow petrel chicks. Snow petrels and Antarctic fulmars tended to have higher Î´ 15 N values than Antarctic and cape petrels, suggesting a higher proportion of fish in their diets. Petrel chicks consistently had higher Î´ 15 N values than adults, which suggests trophic segregation between adults and chicks. We discuss advantages of selectively provisioning chicks with higher trophic level prey. Extensive overlap and a relatively narrow range of Î´ 15 N values are consistent with a food web comprised of few trophic steps.",2000,Marine Ecology Progress Series
Two-layer similarity fusion model for cover song identification,"Various musical descriptors have been developed for Cover Song Identification (CSI). However, different descriptors are based on various assumptions, designed for representing distinct characteristics of music, and often differ in scale and noise level. Therefore, a single similarity function combined with a specific descriptor is generally not able to describe the similarity between songs comprehensively and reliably. In this paper, we propose a two-layer similarity fusion model for CSI, which combines the information carried by different descriptors and similarity functions organically and incorporates the advantages of both early fusion and late fusion. In particular, in the early fusion, the similarities obtained by the same descriptor and different similarity functions are integrated with the Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) technique. Then, in the late fusion, the learning method selected by sparse group LASSO algorithm is applied on each early fused similarity to obtain the probability that the corresponding song pair belongs to the reference/cover pair. Lastly, the final fused similarity is achieved by averaging all the obtained probabilities. Extensive experimental results on the music collection that is composed of samples provided by the SecondHandSongs (SHS) verify that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art fusion based CSI schemes in terms of identification accuracy and classification efficiency.",2017,"EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing"

Validating the LASSO algorithm by unmixing spectral signatures in multicolor phantoms,"As hyperspectral imaging (HSI) sees increased implementation into the biological and medical elds it becomes increasingly important that the algorithms being used to analyze the corresponding output be validated. While certainly important under any circumstance, as this technology begins to see a transition from benchtop to bedside ensuring that the measurements being given to medical professionals are accurate and reproducible is critical. In order to address these issues work has been done in generating a collection of datasets which could act as a test bed for algorithms validation. Using a microarray spot printer a collection of three food color dyes, acid red 1 (AR), brilliant blue R (BBR) and erioglaucine (EG) are mixed together at dierent concentrations in varying proportions at dierent locations on a microarray chip. With the concentration and mixture proportions known at each location, using HSI an algorithm should in principle, based on estimates of abundances, be able to determine the concentrations and proportions of each dye at each location on the chip. These types of data are particularly important in the context of medical measurements as the resulting estimated abundances will be used to make critical decisions which can have a serious impact on an individual's health. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for processing and analyzing HSI data based on the LASSO algorithm (similar to ""basis pursuit""). The LASSO is a statistical method for simultaneously performing model estimation and variable selection. In the context of estimating abundances in an HSI scene these so called ""sparse"" representations provided by the LASSO are appropriate as not every pixel will be expected to contain every endmember. The algorithm we present takes the general framework of the LASSO algorithm a step further and incorporates the rich spatial information which is available in HSI to further improve the estimates of abundance. We show our algorithm's improvement over the standard LASSO using the dye mixture data as the test bed.",2012,

Variable selection in semiparametric transformation models for right-censored data,"We study variable selection in general transformation models for right-censored data. The models studied can incorporate external time-varying covariates, and they include the proportional hazards model and the proportional odds model as special cases. We propose an estimation method that involves minimizing a weighted negative partial loglikelihood function plus an adaptive lasso penalty, with the initial values obtained from nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation. The objective function is parametric and convex, so the minimization is easy to implement. We show that our selection has oracle properties and that the estimator is semiparametrically efficient. We demonstrate the small-sample performance of the proposed method via simulations, and we use the method to analyse data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.

In this paper, firstly I give a review of methods in linear regression, and most concerns with the method of lasso. Lasso for â€˜least absolute shrinkage and selection operatorâ€™ is a regularized version of method adds a constraint which uses norm less or equal to a given value t. By doing so, some predictor coefficients would be shrank and some others might be set to 0. We can attain good interpretation and prediction accuracy by using lasso method. Secondly, I provide some basic proofs for lasso, which would be very helpful in understanding lasso. Additionally, some geometric graphs are also given and one example is illustrated. 1 L",2010,
Riscontro occasionale di pneumopericardio postpericardiocentesi,"Un giovane uomo di 25 anni, sottoposto recentemente ad intervento di resezione quadrangolare del lembo posteriore della mitrale ed anuloplastica per insufficienza mitralica severa da prolasso del lembo posteriore, ha presentato nel decorso postoperatorio iperpiressia e presincopi. Al controllo ecocardiografico si evidenziava versamento pericardico con segni di tamponamento cardiaco che ha richiesto pericardiocentesi dâ€™urgenza. Per la persistenza di iperpiressia e la negativitÃ  degli esami colturali si eseguiva Rx torace (Figura 1) e seguente tomografia computerizzata total body (Figura 2) che documentavano una discreta falda di pneumopericardio. Controlli radiologici seriati hanno mostrato il totale riassorbimento del pneumopericardio. Data la persistente stabilitÃ  emodinamica veniva rimosso il drenaggio pericardico. Il successivo decorso Ã¨ stato privo di complicanze ed il paziente veniva dimesso in buone condizioni cliniche ed in buon compenso cardiocircolatorio. Il pneumopericardio Ã¨ una rara condizione clinica caratterizzata dalla presenza di aria nella cavitÃ  pericardica. I meccanismi eziologici principali sono1: 1) trauma determinante perforazione pericardica2; 2) infezione da microrganismi generanti gas1; 3) meccanismo iatrogeno (in seguito a biopsie miocardiche3, toracentesi, acquisizione di accessi venosi per via giugulare interna, durante ventilazione assistita invasiva con seguente barotrauma, in seguito alla chiusura di una tracheotomia1); o 4) formazione di una fistola tra strutture contenenti aria (albero bronchiale, tratto gastrointestinale o cavitÃ  peritoneale) ed il pericardio stesso1.

"Phylogenetic relationships and biogeography of the groundwater-dwelling amphipod genus Pseudoniphargus (Crustacea), with emphasis on the Iberian species","Numerical phylogenetic methods are applied in order to arrive at synapomorphic similarities between species of the stygobiont amphipod genus Pseudoniphargus. Character polarity is assessed by comparison with the relevant outgroups Parapseudoniphargus and Allomelita, within a cluster of presumedly interrelated genera of Hadzioidea. The degree of morphological differentiation of Pseudoniphargus is low and the available potential apomorphies are insufficient to resolve phylogenetic relationships to the species level. The inconsistency in the data is high, which may be a result of an underlying peripatric speciation model, difficulties in discriminating mutual exclusive and homologous character states, and a high probability of independent character evolution. Problems of phylogeny reconstruction at low taxonomic levels are universal. Accidental problems in the case of a stygobiont group are caused by troglomorphism, structural reduction, and senescent morphology. The results of the study lead to the recognition of four well-corroborated monophyletic groups; three consist of sister species only. Remaining taxa are ungrouped or belong to groups which do not emerge after all numerical approaches. The monophyletic groups of Pseudoniphargus are for the greater part geographically coherent and confined either to the Cantabrian Mountains, or to the Lusitanian-Atlantic region, or to the Betic Cordillera. The possible origin of Pseudoniphargus from a thalassostygobiont progenitor which arose in the eastern Atlantic part of the shallow Tethys sea is discussed.",1988,

Among the disease conditions studied are Hypothyroidism, (Resistant) Hypertension, Type 1 and 2 Diabetes, Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Testicular Cancer, Gallstones, Glaucoma, Gout, Atrial Fibrillation, High Cholesterol, Asthma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Malignant Melanoma, and Heart Attack. We obtain values for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) in the range ~0.58â€“0.71 using SNP data alone. Substantially higher predictor AUCs are obtained when incorporating additional variables such as age and sex. Some SNP predictors alone are sufficient to identify outliers (e.g., in the 99th percentile of polygenic score, or PGS) with 3â€“8 times higher risk than typical individuals. We validate predictors out-of-sample using the eMERGE dataset, and also with different ancestry subgroups within the UK Biobank population. Our results indicate that substantial improvements in predictive power are attainable using training sets with larger case populations. We anticipate rapid improvement in genomic prediction as more case-control data become available for analysis.",2019,Scientific Reports

Testing for a Change in Mean After Changepoint Detection,"While many methods are available to detect structural changes in a time series, few procedures are available to quantify the uncertainty of these estimates post-detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a new framework to test the null hypothesis that there is no change in mean around an estimated changepoint. We further show that it is possible to efficiently carry out this framework in the case of changepoints estimated by binary segmentation, variants of binary segmentation, $\ell_{0}$ segmentation, or the fused lasso. Our setup allows us to condition on much smaller selection events than existing approaches, which yields higher powered tests. Our procedure leads to improved power in simulation and additional discoveries in a dataset of chromosomal guanine-cytosine content.

A timestepper approach for the systematic bifurcation and stability analysis of polymer extrusion dynamics,"Abstract We discuss how matrix-free/timestepper algorithms can efficiently be used with dynamic non-Newtonian fluid mechanics simulators in performing systematic stability/bifurcation analysis. The timestepper approach to bifurcation analysis of large-scale systems is applied to the plane Poiseuille flow of an Oldroyd-B fluid with non-monotonic slip at the wall, in order to further investigate a mechanism of extrusion instability based on the combination of viscoelasticity and non-monotonic slip. Due to the non-monotonicity of the slip equation the resulting steady-state flow curve is non-monotonic and unstable steady states appear in the negative-slope regime. It has been known that self-sustained oscillations of the pressure gradient are obtained when an unstable steady state is perturbed [M.M. Fyrillas, G.C. Georgiou, D. Vlassopoulos, S.G. Hatzikiriakos, A mechanism for extrusion instabilities in polymer melts, Polymer Eng. Sci. 39 (1999) 2498â€“2504]. Treating the simulator of a distributed parameter model describing the dynamics of the above flow as an inputâ€“output â€œblack-boxâ€ timestepper of the state variables, stable and unstable branches of both equilibrium and periodic oscillating solutions are computed and their stability is examined. It is shown for the first time how equilibrium solutions lose stability to oscillating ones through a subcritical Hopf bifurcation point which generates a branch of unstable limit cycles and how the stable periodic solutions lose their stability through a critical point which marks the onset of the unstable limit cycles. This implicates the coexistence of stable equilibria with stable and unstable periodic solutions in a narrow range of volumetric flow rates.",2007,Journal of Non-newtonian Fluid Mechanics
Bin-based model construction and analytical strategies for dissecting complex traits with chromosome segment substitution lines,"Chromosome segment substitution lines have been created in several experimental models, including many plant and animal species, and are useful tools for the genetic analysis and mapping of complex traits. The traditional t-test is usually applied to identify a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that is contained within a chromosome segment to estimate the QTLâ€™s effect. However, current methods cannot uncover the entire genetic structure of complex traits. For example, current methods cannot distinguish between main effects and epistatic effects. In this paper, a linear epistatic model was constructed to dissect complex traits. First, all the long substituted segments were divided into overlapping small bins, and each small bin was considered a unique independent variable. The genetic model for complex traits was then constructed. When considering all the possible main effects and epistatic effects, the dimensions of the linear model can become extremely high. Therefore, variable selection via stepwise regression (Bin-REG) was proposed for the epistatic QTL analysis in the present study. Furthermore, we tested the feasibility of using the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) algorithm to estimate epistatic effects, examined the fully Bayesian SSVS (stochastic search variable selection) approach, tested the empirical Bayes (E-BAYES) method, and evaluated the penalized likelihood (PENAL) method for mapping epistatic QTLs. Simulation studies suggested that all of the above methods, excluding the LASSO and PENAL approaches, performed satisfactorily. The Bin-REG method appears to outperform all other methods in terms of estimating positions and effects.",2012,Chinese Science Bulletin

EigenNet: A Bayesian hybrid of generative and conditional models for sparse learning,"For many real-world applications, we often need to select correlated variablesâ€” such as genetic variations and imaging features associated with Alzheimer's diseaseâ€”in a high dimensional space. The correlation between variables presents a challenge to classical variable selection methods. To address this challenge, the elastic net has been developed and successfully applied to many applications. Despite its great success, the elastic net does not exploit the correlation information embedded in the data to select correlated variables. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel hybrid model, EigenNet, that uses the eigenstructures of data to guide variable selection. Specifically, it integrates a sparse conditional classification model with a generative model capturing variable correlations in a principled Bayesian framework. We develop an efficient active-set algorithm to estimate the model via evidence maximization. Experimental results on synthetic data and imaging genetics data demonstrate the superior predictive performance of the EigenNet over the lasso, the elastic net, and the automatic relevance determination.",2011,
"Climateâ€related, decadalâ€scale assemblage changes of seagrassâ€associated fishes in the northern Gulf of Mexico","Global temperatures are rising, and are expected to produce a poleward shift in the distribution of many organisms. We quantified changes in fish assemblages within seagrass meadows of the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) between the 1970s and 2006â€2007, and observed changes consistent with this forecast. During 2006â€2007 we sampled seagrass meadows using the same gears and methods previously employed by R. J. Livingston in coastal waters of northwest Florida throughout the 1970s. Comparisons between datasets revealed numerous additions to the fish fauna during 2006â€2007 that were completely absent in the 1970s, including: Lutjanus synagris (lane snapper), Epinephelus morio (red grouper), Chaetodon ocellatus (spotfin butterflyfish), Mycteroperca sp (grouper, non gag), Centropristis philadelphica (rock sea bass), Fistularia tabacaria (bluespotted cornetfish), Ocyurus chrysurus (yellowtail snapper), Thalassoma bifasciatum (bluehead wrasse), Abudefduf saxatilis (sergeant major), Acanthuridae spp. (surgeonfishes) and Sparisoma viride (stoplight parrotfish).

All of these are tropical or subtropical species that now make up a greater percentage of seagrass-associated fish assemblages in the northern GOM than in the past. Additionally, we observed regional increases in air and sea surface temperatures (431C) during the 30 years that separate Livingstonâ€™s samples and ours that correlate with northern shifts in the distribution of warm-water fishes.

Massenspektrometrische untersuchungen zur elementaranalyse organischer verbindungenâ€”III: VerbrennungsvorgÃ¤nge im leeren rohr,"Zusammenfassung Es wird eine Mesanordnung beschrieben, die es gestattet, alle Phasen von Verbrennungsprozessen in Abhangigkeit von Tragergas, Temperatur, Verweilzeit und Rohrfullung zu untersuchen. Die organische Probe wird hierzu mit konstanter Geschwindigkeit einem Tragergasstrom zugefuhrt und mit diesem in wenigen Millisekunden durch eine Uberbruckungskapulare dem Verbrennungsraum zugeleitet. Die dort entstehenden Reaktionsprodukte werden mittels einer viskosen Einlassonde abgeschnuffelt und einem Massenspektrometer zugefuhrt. Reaktionszeit und Reaktionstemperatur sind in weiten Grenzen einstellbar oder stetig veranderlich. Tragt man, bei vorgegebener Reaktionszeit, den Reaktionsgrad der verschiedenen Verbrennungsprodukte in Abhangigkeit von der Temperatur auf, so erhalt man in den Oxidations-Thermogrammen eine ubersichtliche Darstellung des Verbrennungsprozesses. Aus den Thermogrammen reprasentativer Verbindungen wird deutlich, das in Anwesenheit von Sauerstoff der Zerfall der Proben bei erheblich tieferer Temperatur erfolgt, als dies in Inertgas der Fall ist. Als Primarschritt der Zersetzung wird die â€œoxidative Pyrolyseâ€ erkannt, die haufig zu vollig anderen Produkten fuhrt, als die Inertpyrolyse. Die gefundenen Zwischenprodukte sind teilweise strukturspezifisch und insbesondere bei stickstoffhaltigen Proben sehr zahlreich und langlebig (bspw. Kohlenmonoxid, Stickstoffmonoxid, Dicyan, Cyanwasserstoff, Cyansaure und Methylcyanat). Die oft zitierte â€œSchwerverbrennbarkeitâ€ ist im wesentlichen darauf zuruckzufuhren, das Kohlenmonoxid, Cyansaure und Cyanwasserstoff erst bei sehr hoher Temperatur vollstandig verbrannt werden. Die Verbrennungseigenschaften des â€œleeren Rohresâ€ konnen durch eine Fullung mit Quarzwolle merklich und durch teilweise Fullung mit Platinwolle erheblich verbessert werden.",1975,Talanta
Data-Driven Sparse System Identification,"In this paper, we study the system identification porblem for sparse linear time-invariant systems. We propose a sparsity promoting Lasso-type estimator to identify the dynamics of the system with only a limited number of input-state data samples. Using contemporary results on high-dimensional statistics, we prove that $\Omega(k_{\max}\log(m+n))$ data samples are enough to reliably estimate the system dynamics, where n and m are the number of states and inputs, respectively, and $k_{\max}$ is the maximum number of nonzero elements in the rows of input and state matrices. The number of samples in the developed estimator is significantly smaller than the dimension of the problem for sparse systems, and yet it offers a small estimation error entry-wise. Furthermore, we show that, unlike the recently celebrated least-squares estimators for system identification problems, the method developed in this work is capable of exact recovery of the underlying sparsity structure of the system with the aforementioned number of data samples. Extensive case studies on synthetically generated systems and physical mass-spring networks are offered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2018,"2018 56th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)"
Analysis Recovery With Coherent Frames and Correlated Measurements,"This paper introduces the restricted eigenvalue condition adapted to frame D (D-RE), which is a natural extension to the standard restricted eigenvalue condition. The D-RE condition is a relaxation of the Dâ€ -RIP, where Dâ€  = (DD*)-1 D is the canonical dual frame of D. We establish the D-RE condition for several classes of correlated measurement matrices, when the covariance matrix of row measurements satisfies the D-RE condition. Furthermore, by the D-RE condition, we get the error bounds in the analysis LASSO (ALASSO) and the analysis Dantzig Selector (ADS) under a sparsity scenario. In order to recover non-sparse signals, we consider the robust 12 D-nullspace property of correlated Gaussian matrices. Similarly, we get the error estimations in the ALASSO and the ADS in non-sparse case. The approximation equivalence between the ALASSO and the ADS is also established by calculating prediction loss difference.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
Safe Bayesian Linear Regression,"We study generalized Bayesian inference under misspecification, i.e. when the model is `wrong but useful'. Generalized Bayes equips the likelihood with a learning rate Î·. We show that for generalized linear models (GLMs), Î·-generalized Bayes concentrates around the best approximation of the truth within the model for specific Î·â‰ 1, even under severely misspecified noise, as long as the tails of the true distribution are exponential. We then derive MCMC samplers for generalized Bayesian lasso and logistic regression, and give examples of both simulated and real-world data in which generalized Bayes outperforms standard Bayes by a vast margin.",2019,

Construction of a novel gene-based model for prognosis prediction of clear cell renal cell carcinoma,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) comprises the majority of kidney cancer death worldwide, whose incidence and mortality are not promising. Identifying ideal biomarkers to construct a more accurate prognostic model than conventional clinical parameters is crucial. Raw count of RNA-sequencing data and clinicopathological data were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Tumor samples were divided into two sets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in the whole set and prognosis-related genes were identified from the training set. Their common genes were used in LASSO and best subset regression which were performed to identify the best prognostic 5 genes. The gene-based risk score was developed based on the Cox coefficient of the individual gene. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplanâ€“Meier (KM) survival analysis were used to assess its prognostic power. GSE29609 dataset from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database was used to validate the signature. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were performed to screen independent prognostic parameters to construct a nomogram. The predictive power of the nomogram was revealed by time-dependent ROC curves and the calibration plot and verified in the validation set. Finally, Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs and 5 novel genes were performed to suggest the potential biological pathways. PADI1, ATP6V0D2, DPP6, C9orf135 and PLG were screened to be significantly related to the prognosis of ccRCC patients. The risk score effectively stratified the patients into high-risk group with poor overall survival (OS) based on survival analysis. AJCC-stage, age, recurrence and risk score were regarded as independent prognostic parameters by Cox regression analysis and were used to construct a nomogram. Time-dependent ROC curves showed the nomogram performed best in 1-, 3- and 5-year survival predictions compared with AJCC-stage and risk score in validation sets. The calibration plot showed good agreement of the nomogram between predicted and observed outcomes. Functional enrichment analysis suggested several enriched biological pathways related to cancer. In our study, we constructed a gene-based model integrating clinical prognostic parameters to predict prognosis of ccRCC well, which might provide a reliable prognosis assessment tool for clinician and aid treatment decision-making in the clinic.",2020,Cancer Cell International

Development and Validation of a microRNA Panel to Differentiate between Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Controls.,"OBJECTIVE
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate genes and are both biomarkers and mediators of disease. We used small RNA (sRNA) sequencing and machine learning methodology to develop a miRNA panel to reliably differentiate between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and control subjects.


METHODS
Plasma samples from 167 RA and 91 control subjects frequency-matched for age, race and sex were used for sRNA sequencing. TIGER was used to analyze miRNAs. DESeq2 and random forest analyses were used to identify a prioritized list of miRNAs differentially expressed in patients with RA. Prioritized miRNAs were validated by quantitative PCR, and lasso and logistic regression were used to select the final panel of six miRNAs that best differentiated RA from controls. The panel was validated in a separate cohort of 12 SLE, 32 RA and 32 control subjects. Panel efficacy was assessed by area under the receiver operative characteristic curve (AUC) analyses.


RESULTS
The final panel included miR-22-3p, miR-24-3p, miR-96-5p, miR-134-5p, miR-140-3p, and miR- 627-5p. The panel differentiated RA from control subjects in discovery (AUC=0.81) and validation cohorts (AUC=0.71), seronegative RA (AUC=0.84), RA remission (AUC=0.85), and SLE patients (AUC=0.80) versus controls. Pathway analysis showed upstream regulators and targets of panel miRNAs are associated with pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis.


CONCLUSION
A miRNA panel identified by a bioinformatic approach differentiated between RA or SLE patients and control subjects. The panel may represent an autoimmunity signature, perhaps related to inflammatory arthritis, which is not dependent on active disease or seropositivity.",2019,The Journal of rheumatology

This report documents the phenomenological calculations and sources of. uncertainty in the calculations performed with HELCOR in support of the Level II portion of the PRA. These calculations are an integral part of the Level II analysis since they provide quantitative input to the Accident Progression Event Tree (APET) and Source Term Model (LASSOR). However, the uncertainty associated with the code results must be considered in the use of the results. The MELCOR calculations performed include four integrated calculations: (1) a high-pressure short-term station blackout, (2) a low-pressure short-term station blackout, (3) an intermediate-term station blackout, and (4) a long-term station blackout.

Functional SPECT neuroimaging using machine learning algorithms distinguishes autism spectrum disorder from healthy subjects,"The diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) relies on history and behavioral observation, lacking reliable biomarkers. We performed a retrospective analysis using machine learning algorithms of 928 persons with ASD (mean age: 17 Â± 10.8 years; age range 4-67) obtained from a multisite psychiatric database with rest and on-task brain SPECT scans to investigate whether or not these scans distinguish ASD from healthy controls (HC, n=101; mean age: 43 Â± 17.2 years; age range 13-84). Using 128 regions of interest extracts (ROIs), we applied multiple machine learning algorithms for binary classification. Due to an unbalanced sample size between ASD and controls, we then sub-sampled the data prior to feature selection and classification. Using a subsampled dataset, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature selection with Random Forest method baseline accuracy results of approximately 81% were achieved, based on optimal classifier settings with the top selected features. We applied machine learning algorithms to ASD adults only, the majority of our sample, and selected subjects in both AD and HC groups with age range of 13-67 years and found the results consistent with the combined data. These machine learning results identified potential diagnostic biomarkers differentiating ASD from HC in the regions of the cerebellum and vermis, anterior cingulate gyrus, amygdala, thalamus, frontal, and temporal lobes.

Genomic predictions of breeding values in a cloned Eucalyptus globulus population in Chile,"In Chile, an intensive Eucalyptus globulus clonal selection program is being carried out to increase forest productivity for pulp production. A breeding population was used to investigate the predicted ability of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for genomic selection (GS). A total of 310 clones from 53 families were used. Stem volume and wood density were measured on all clones. Trees were genotyped at 12Â K polymorphic markers using the EUChip60K genotype array. Genomic best linear unbiased prediction, Bayesian lasso regression, Bayes B, and Bayes C models were used to predict genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV). For cross-validation, 260 individuals were sampled for model training and 50 individuals for model validation, using 2 folds and 10 replications each. The average predictive ability estimates for wood density and stem volume across the models were 0.58 and 0.75, respectively. The average rank correlations were 0.59 and 0.71, respectively. Models produced very similar bias for both traits. When clones were ranked based on their GEBV, models had similar phenotypic mean for the top 10% of the clones. The predicted ability of markers will likely decrease if the models are used to predict GEBV of new material coming from the breeding program, because of a different markerâ€“trait phase introduced by recombination. The results should be validated with larger populations and across two generations before routine applications of GS in E. globulus. We suggest that GS is a viable strategy to accelerate clonal selection program of E. globulus in Chile.",2017,Tree Genetics & Genomes
"Julio Cano Lasso en Fuentelarreina. Ciudad histÃ³rica, arquitectura popular y sustentabilidad","El objetivo de esta investigacion es el analisis del metodo utilizado en los proyectos de Julio Cano Lasso y la 
busqueda de relaciones de su obra con referencias externas a ella que ejemplifiquen lo que hemos denominado 
â€œmetodo referencialâ€ dentro de su metodologia proyectual global. Este metodo referencial, que se relaciona 
claramente con modelos no lineales de creacion como el â€œAtlas Mnemosyneâ€ de Aby Warburg, los 
â€œPassagenWerkâ€ de Walter Benjamin o el Teatro de la Memoriaâ€ de Giulio Camillo, es utilizado por el arquitecto 
no solo de forma iconica, como catalizador del proyecto, sino tambien de forma instrumental, extrayendo de la 
referencia en cuestion estrategias validas para su aplicacion en la actividad proyectual. 
Para este fin, se utiliza el analisis comparativo a distintos niveles entre las herramientas usadas por Julio Cano 
Lasso en los sucesivos proyectos realizados, junto con Juan Antonio Ridruejo, entre los anos 1968 y 1976 para 
las Oficinas Centrales de Telefonica en Fuentelarreina, Madrid. Estos tres proyectos, con un programa que va 
variando con el tiempo en distintas localizaciones dentro de una extensa parcela, se desarrollan partiendo de 
esquemas organizativos completamente diferentes. 
Paradojicamente, es debido a la aplicacion de los mismos instrumentos proyectuales, obtenidos de la referencia 
a las ciudades historicas y a la arquitectura popular, como son la gradacion en la tension entre fragmentacion y 
unidad, la dialectica entre el edificio y el paisaje y la sustentabilidad como herramienta proyectual, por lo que 
resultan completamente diversos en el nivel morfologico. 
Los sucesivos proyectos presentan opciones antagonicas en el tratamiento de espacios abiertos y volumenes 
construidos, en las posibilidades y formas de ampliacion, en la materialidad, en la relacion entre el interior y el 
exterior del propio edificio, en su dialogo con el contexto fisico y en su orden geometrico. En cambio resultan 
completamente convergentes en su lectura exterior como edificios-ciudad y en su tratamiento de los sistemas de 
acondicionamiento climatico tanto pasivos, derivados de la referencia a la arquitectura popular, como basados en 
la tecnica, como principales generadores de la forma arquitectonica. Estas caracteristicas, refiriendonos a 
proyectos de esa epoca, fortalecen su vigencia como precursores del actual auge del paradigma termodinamico 
en arquitectura. 
Ademas, este tipo de referencia dentro de los â€œcampos semanticosâ€ manejados por Julio Cano Lasso, tiene la 
caracteristica especial de utilizar un elemento mediador; la elaboracion de los dibujos, que presentan distintos 
momentos de desarrollo en el tiempo de varias ciudades historicas. Los dibujos realizados a lo largo de sus anos 
de ejercicio profesional, muchos de ellos publicados en su libro â€œLa ciudad y su paisajeâ€ se convierten en el

Assessment of the Efficiency of Hospitals before and after the Implementation of the Health Reform Plan in Qazvin Province Based on the Pabon Lasso Model (2011 - 2016),"Introduction: In order to measure the efficiency of hospitals, various approaches have been proposed, which among them the Pabon Laso model graphically evaluates the performance of hospitals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of hospitals affiliated to Qazvin University of Medical Sciences three years before and after implementation of the Health Reform Plan. Method: This study was descriptive-analytic and evaluated the performance of 6 Public hospitals and 5 private hospitals of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in the 3 years before (2011-2013) and 3 years after (2014-2016) the implementation of the Health Reform Plan with the Pabon Lasso model. In this model, three indicators (bed turnover, bed occupancy and average length of stay) were used simultaneously. Data was collected using a standard checklist. SPSS software was used to analyze the data. Results: The results showed that the average of three indicators in public hospitals (bed turnover, bed occupancy rate and hospital stay) has changed from 59.61 to 77.63, 61.13 to 75.75 and 4.96 to 5.15, respectively, and in private hospitals, respectively, from 109 .33 to 92.81, 63.23 to 54.73, 2.3 to 2.2. Conclusion: In general, performance indicators of hospitals affiliated to Qazvin University of Medical Sciences are in a desirable condition regarding standards. However, with the implementation of the Health Reform Plan and the reduction of out of the pocket patients in public hospitals, they have increased the number of patients referred to these hospitals and their transfer to the fourth zone. Therefore, measures should be taken to use the appropriate strategies for optimal and efficient use of resources for proper management.",2018,
"Credible Research Designs for Minimum Wage Studies: a Response to Neumark, Salas, and Wascher","The authors assess the critique by Neumark, Salas, and Wascher (2014) of minimum wage studies that found small effects on teen employment. Data from 1979 to 2014 contradict NSW; the authors show that the disemployment suggested by a model assuming parallel trends across U.S. states mostly reflects differential pre-existing trends. A data-driven LASSO procedure that optimally corrects for state trends produces a small employment elasticity (â€“0.01). Even a highly sparse model rules out substantial disemployment effects, contrary to NSWâ€™s claim that the authors discard too much information. Synthetic controls do place more weight on nearby statesâ€” confirming the value of regional controlsâ€”and generate an elasticity of 20.04. A similar elasticity (â€“0.06) obtains from a design comparing contiguous border counties, which the authors show to be good controls. NSWâ€™s preferred matching estimates mix treatment and control units, obtain poor matches, and find the highest employment declines where the relative minimum wage falls. These findings refute NSWâ€™s key claims.",2015,

IL-5 and IL-17A are critical for the chronic IgE response and differentiation of long-lived antibody-secreting cells in inflamed tissues.,"Prolonged survival of long-lived antibody-secreting cells in the BM has been implicated as a key component of long-term humoral immunity. The current study was designed to uncover the extrinsic signals required for the generation and maintenance of ASC in several niches (peritoneum, spleen and bone-marrow). Our results show that protein mixture of the Thalassophryne nattereri venom induced a chronic Th2 humoral response that is characterized by splenic hyperplasia with GC formation and venom retention by follicular DCs. Retention of B1a in the BM were observed. In the late phase (120d) of chronic venom-response the largest pool of ASC into the peritoneal cavity consisted of B220(neg)CD43(high) phenotype; the largest pool of ASC into spleen was constituted by B220 positive cells (B220(high) and B220(low)), whereas the largest pool of ASC into in the BM was constituted by the B220(high)CD43(low) phenotype; and finally, terminally differentiated cells (B220(neg)CD43(high)) were only maintained in the inflamed peritoneal cavity in late phase. After 120d a sustained production of cytokines (KC, IL-5, TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-17A and IL-23) and leukocytes recruitment (eosinophils, mast cells, and neutrophils) were induced. IL-5- and IL-17A-producing CD4+ CD44+ CD40L+ Ly6C+ effector memory T cells were also observed in peritoneal cavity. Finally, treatment of venom-mice with anti-IL-5- and anti-IL17A-neutralizing mAbs abolished the synthesis of specific IgE, without modifying the splenic hyperplasia or GC formation. In addition, IL-5 and IL-17A negatively regulated the expansion of B1a in peritoneal cavity and BM, and promoted the differentiation of these cells in spleen. And more, IL-5 and IL-17A are sufficient for the generation of ASC B220(neg) in the peritoneal cavity and negatively regulate the number of ASC B220(pos), confirming that the hierarchical process of ASC differentiation triggered by venom needs the signal derived from IL-5 and IL-17A.",2012,Cytokine

(eds.), Select Proceedings from the 3rd International Conference on Water Resource and Environment (WRE2017). Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 84, pp. 77â€“81. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Dispersant is widely used in spill oil response treatment, and the addition of dispersant may influence the biodegradation of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH). Dispersant GM-2 was applied to the petroleum polluted seawater in a simulated experiment of an oil spill accident. PCR- RFLP (Restricted Fragment Length Polymorphisms) technique was used to explore the bacterial community structure when dispersant/oil ratio (DOR) is 10%, 20% and 30%, respectively. Results showed the predominant bacterial genera in seawater after the addition of dispersant includes: Alcanivorax, Marinomonas, Flavobacterium, Achromobacter, Parvibaculum, Thalassospira xianhensis and Ochrobactrum. Compared with the most similar bacteria strains after sequencing and analyzing, it is found that the proportion of bacteria unable to hydrolyze Tween80 decrease as well as the alkane degrading bacteria. However, the percentage of the PAHs (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and LAS (linear alkylbenzene sulfonate) degrading bacteria increases. Results from the biodegradation study showed that the degradation half-time of TPH decrease from 26.7 d to 19.8 d, 16.1 d and 15.1 d when DOR increased from 0 to 10%, 20% and 30%, so the degradation half-time reduced by 25.7%, 39.5% and 43.5%, respectively. The experiment indicated that in the process of adding GM-2 to oil polluted seawater until DOR reached 30%, the percentage of bacteria that adapt to the surfactant or specialized in the degradation of PAHs and LAS increase, and this spontaneous adjustment accelerates the biodegradation rate of TPH.",2018,Journal of Coastal Research
"Shimia thalassica sp. nov., and reclassification of Pseudopelagicola gijangensis as Shimia gijangensis comb. nov., and Thalassobius activus as Cognatishimia activa comb. nov.","Strain CECT 7735T, a marine Gram-reaction negative, aerobic, non-motile bacterium, was isolated from coastal seawater in Valencia, Spain. Strain CECT 7735T is chemoorganotrophic, mesophilic, slightly halophilic, grows at 15-28â€‰Â°Câ€‰but not at 4 or 37â€‰Â°C, requires seawater for growth and grows up to 6â€Š% salinity. The major cellular fatty acid is summed feature 8 (C18â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰7c and/or C18â€Š:â€Š1Ï‰6c). The G+Câ€‰content of the genome is 55.7â€‰mol%. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence shows the strain is affiliated to the family Rhodobacteraceae, in the class Alphaproteobacteria, with highest similarities to Phaeobacter species (97.0-97.5â€Š%), Shimia species (96.5-97.3â€Š%) and Pseudopelagicola gijangensis (96.5â€Š%). Further phylogenomic analysis through the up-to-date-bacterial core gene (UBCG) set showed P. gijangensis to be its closest relative. Average nucleotide identity and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization values are lower than 85 and 21â€Š%, respectively, with its phylogenetic relatives, suggesting that strain CECT 7735T represents a new species. The average amino acid identity value was over 70â€Š% with the genome of the type strain of P. gijangensis and with all those of Shimia species. These values, together with UBCG set trees, suggest that the new species and P. gijangensisbelong to the same genus and that Pseudopelagicola should be reclassified as a Shimia species. We conclude that strain CECT 7735T represents a new species in the genus Shimia, for which we propose the name Shimiathalassica sp. nov. In addition, Pseudopelagicola gijangensis is reclassified as Shimiagijangensis comb. nov. From the same phylogenomic study, it can be concluded that Thalassobius activus should be reclassified in the genus Cognatishimia as Cognatishimiaactiva comb. nov.",2019,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
Fluoxetine-treated male wrasses exhibit low AVT expression,"In many species, increasing serotonergic activity can reduce aggression and reverse dominance relationships. These effects may in part be mediated through interactions with the arginine vasotocin/vasopressin (AVT/AVP) system. We tested this hypothesis in a territorial coral reef fish, the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), by experimentally enhancing serotonergic neurotransmission, using the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. Terminal phase (TP) males received 2 weeks of nightly intraperitoneal fluoxetine injections (6 microg/g body weight) and were then tested for their aggressive response to an intruder and killed to examine AVT phenotype in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA), an area important to social behavior in fishes. Our previously published study demonstrated that fluoxetine-treated males are less aggressive [H.A.N. Perreault, K. Semsar, J. Godwin, Fluoxetine treatment decreases territorial aggression in a coral reef fish, Physiol. and Behav. 79 (2003) 719-724.]. Here, further study of these same fluoxetine-treated males shows approximately twofold lower AVT mRNA expression relative to saline-treated controls in all regions of the POA (all p< or =0.05) without any changes in AVT-ir soma size (all p>0.4). This study experimentally supports the hypothesis that behavioral effects of SSRIs may be mediated in part through interactions with the AVT/AVP system. These results parallel findings from rodents and humans and are consistent with an indirect neurosteroidogenic rather than a solely direct serotonergic mechanism for SSRI effects on the AVT/AVP system. Furthermore, they suggest that SSRI effects on neuroendocrine function may be best modeled in animals with sensitive stress responses such as those found in nondomesticated animals.",2004,Brain Research
Effects of Ciguatera Toxins on the Bluehead,"Abstract Distinct behavioral abnormalities were displayed by blueheads Thalassoma bifasciatum (wrasse: Labridae) after consumption of a dinoflagellate responsible for producing ciguatera toxins. The symptoms, including skin color variations, inactivity, loss of equilibrium, erratic swimming, jerky feeding movements, loss of orientation, and loss of net avoidance ability, appeared after oral treatments ranging from 0.26 to 4.88 mgË™gâˆ’1 of freeze-dried Gambierdiscus toxicus cells. Results suggest that the adverse effects of toxins on blueheads would increase their susceptibility to predation, subsequently increasing the rate of transference within the food chain.",1986,Transactions of The American Fisheries Society

Improving FMRI prediction of purchases with Penalized Discriminant Analyses,"Despite growing interest in applying machine learning algorithms to brain data, few studies have gone beyond classifying sensory input to using brain activity to directly predicting behavioral output. With spatial resolution on the order of millimeters and temporal resolution on the order of seconds, functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) data is a promising candidate for such applications. However, FMRI data's low signal-to-noise ratio, high dimensionality, and extensive spatial and temporal correlations present formidable analytic challenges. Here, we apply di erent preprocessing and machine learning algorithms to a previously-acquired dataset [23] to examine the ability of FMRI activation in three regions the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and insula to predict purchasing. Our goal was to increase both classi cation rates and spatiotemporal interpretability. To this end, penalized discriminant analyses based on the LASSO, Elastic Net, and Univariate Soft Thresholding enabled automatic selection of correlated subsets of variables. Relative to logistic regression and linear discriminant analyses these methods provided both better classi cation rates and interpretability. These ndings validate temporal inferences about which brain regions utilize which types of information in subsequent purchasing decisions. Penalized discriminant analyses methods may improve future attempts to use FMRI data to make single-trial behavioral predictions.",2007,

Fast Identification of Encrypted Traffic via Large-Scale Sparse Screening,"Encrypted traffic identification has great significance to regulate illegal data, detect network attacks and protect users' information. Here we propose a novel approach to fast identify encrypted traffic via large-scale sparse screening. We investigate randomness features using Lasso regression to select the most relevant features. To make it more efficient to solve large-scale problems, we employ Enhanced Dual Polytope Projections(EDPP) screening rule to remove irrelevant features quickly. The identification is performed with the help of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) because of its better identification and faster speed. Experimental results show that the method is efficient and effective in encrypted traffic identification.",2017,2017 Fifth International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big Data (CBD)

Quantile regression and variable selection of partial linear single-index model,"Partial linear single-index model (PLSIM) is a flexible and applicable model when investigating the underlying relationship between the response and the multivariate covariates. Most previous studies on PLSIM concentrated on mean regression, based on least square or likelihood approach. In contrast to this method, in this paper, we propose minimizing average check loss estimation (MACLE) procedure to conduct quantile regression of PLSIM. We construct an initial consistent quantile regression estimator of the parametric part base multi-dimensional kernels, and further promote the estimation efficiency to the optimal rate. We discuss the optimal bandwidth selection method and establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed MACLE estimators. Furthermore, we consider an adaptive lasso penalized variable selection method and establish its oracle property. Simulation studies with various distributed error and a real data analysis are conducted to show the promise of our proposed methods.",2015,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
ModÃ©lisation de structures syntaxiques complexes pour apprentissage de langue sur le rÃ©seau,"Notre intention dans cette recherche est de construire une architecture gerant des ressources pedagogiques et en particulier un systeme dâ€™enseignement de syntaxe du francais, sur serveur, a lâ€™intention dâ€™apprenants universitaires chinois. Ce systeme sera accessible sur Internet pour toute personne de culture chinoise, disposant deja dâ€™un niveau correct en francais et desireuse de perfectionner ses connaissances syntaxiques. La realisation de ce projet exige de partir d'une situation de terrain, d'une situation linguistique, totalement decrites et de connaitre le fonctionnement des outils necessaires a sa mise en Å“uvre. Nous avons recours a une modelisation en Grammaire d'arbres adjoints (TAG), qui nous permet de mieux evaluer les differences entre les deux langues et dâ€™en tenir compte pour la formalisation , la modelisation cognitive de lâ€™apprentissage et la planification de nos didacticiels. Tenant compte aussi des resultats deja obtenus dans les interfaces homme-machine, des programmes dâ€™EAO et dâ€™EIAO, de nos observations de terrain, nous tentons de degager un outil qui permette a lâ€™apprenant de se constituer un savoir syntaxique. Pensant quâ€™une approche empirique est insuffisante, nous nous appuyons sur des modeles theoriques des syntaxes chinoise et francaise, mais ne prenons en compte que la syntaxe complexe des deux langues, en particulier les phenomenes de subordination. Ce domaine est particulierement redoute des apprenants, etant donne que ces deux langues sont de type tres eloigne. Nous presentons une etude comparee des syntaxes chinoises et francaises. Nous soulignons les points de divergences syntaxiques ainsi que les problemes des Chinois quand ils redigent des phrases complexes en francais. Ensuite, on essaie de tracer un classement comparatif des structures des syntaxes francaise et chinoise. Nous traitons dâ€™abord les phrases francaises simples a tete verbale. Les arbres TAG de tous les exemples ainsi que le processus de construction des arbres sont presentes. Nous nous efforcons de dresser ensuite une typologie de la subordination francaise et chinoise. Nous classons les phrases selon le degre de difference entre les structures dans les deux langues. Le dernier type regroupe donc les phrases ou il y a le moins de ressemblances entre le francais et le chinois. Tous les types sont presentes sous forme dâ€™arbres TAG. La derniere etape de cette these consiste a elaborer un logiciel implantable sur Internet correspondant a des sequences didactiques, gerant les apprentissages. Les concepts dâ€™explication, de prise en charge des differents modeles dâ€™apprentissage de langues, de niveau dâ€™expertise permettent de traiter de facon adequate tout apprenant ainsi que son cursus.

Censored quantile regression processes under dependence and penalization,"We consider quantile regression processes from censored data under dependent data structures and derive a uniform Bahadur representation for those processes. We also consider cases where the dimension of the parameter in the quantile regression model is large. It is demonstrated that traditional penalized estimators such as the adaptive lasso yield sub-optimal rates if the coecients of the quantile regression cross zero. New penalization techniques are introduced which are able to deal with specic problems of censored data and yield estimates with an optimal rate. In contrast to most of the literature, the asymptotic analysis does not require the assumption of independent observations, but is based on rather weak assumptions, which are satised for many",2012,Electronic Journal of Statistics

The Landscape of Hollywood Westerns: Ecocriticism in an American Film Genre (review),"Fast draW As a popular cinematic genre the Hollywood Westernâ€”those rip-roaring, fast-riding, Hell-bentfor-leather photodramas with clear distinctions between good and evilâ€”remain forever embedded in the psyche of countless Americans. Why wouldnâ€™t they? As motion pictures, these titles conjure up one vicarious thrill after another. What young boy doesnâ€™t dream of jumping on a white horse and, with a lasso twirling in the wind, toss it around the shoulders of a fleeing, black-mustachioed villain, trying to escape with some widowâ€™s lifetime savings or maybe a fast draw, on a dusty main street, against a pockmarked desperado, some baddie, who has just pushed aside a local shopkeeper and wants to take over the town? But what about topography? What role does it play in understanding motion pictures from this period? Does this terrainâ€”sometimes hostile and unfriendly, often bucolic and sereneâ€”foster the myth of cowboys, rustlers, and Indians? Does it create a faulty and dreamlike reality of nineteenth-century expansion? In short, how significant is the environment in understanding the reality of Americaâ€™s West? These questionsâ€” and many moreâ€”are posited in a superb anthology that scrutinizes the importance of nature and countryside in popular feature-length photodramas. Edited by Deborah A. Carmichael, The Landscape of Hollywood Westerns: Ecocriticism in an American Film Genre offers twelve interpretations of environmental themes found in Western screenplays. For starters, the 1928 silent film, The Wind, evaluates both the novel and photodrama of a social document that, historically, was ahead of its time, while The Grapes of Wrath, the gritty social protest story about the plight of the Okies, contains numerous latent Western motifs, Tulsa, the oil field film, examines industrial expansion, and Pale Riderâ€”a copycat version of Shaneâ€”serves as a morality tale. A fourth chapter highlights the Technicolor process in Northwest Passage a breakthrough technology that spotlighted the landscapeâ€™s natural beauty, while a fifth selection heralds the river-as-teacher theme glorifying the mysticism associated with free-flowing water. Other issues discuss the philosophical differences of producing a 1970 environmental motion picture from a 1920s text; a study of Easy Rider, juxtaposing the 1960s counter-cultureâ€™s view of open spaces with rightwing Americaâ€™s concept of law and order; a varied explanation of Hollywoodâ€™s Mexican-American themes, debunking the stereotype that this ethnic group lacked any interest in land preservation; a hard look at John Fordâ€™s famous Monument Valley pictures, emphasizing the directorâ€™s reaffirmation of this terrainâ€™s sanctity; and, an analysis of High Noon, explaining the many allegories imbedded in this Academy Award screenplay. Certainly, this anthology represents some new ideas about the Hollywood Western, a genre that traces its roots back to 1903 when The Great Train Robbery flickered before amazed audiences in those cramped nickelodeons, right up to current times where made-for-television screenplays still enthrall a new generation of viewers, even though most of them sit in plush living rooms. Why wouldnâ€™t they? As Carmichael points out, films about the American West have endured throughout the history of moviemaking, but, she reiterates, the wildness of the western landscape may offer subliminal reasons why these moving pictures retain their popularity. After all, most of these photoplays reveal, either directly or subconsciously, an understanding of the national ethos. Clearly there is a relationship, as Carmichael suggests, between rivers and borderlands, prairies and mountains as nature works to redefine culture or reinforce existing ideas. What, then, is the role of the Western terrain? How does environment foster human behavior? What are the generic formulas that shape screenlandâ€™s version of a nineteenth century world? These questionsâ€”and many moreâ€”are analyzed from different viewpoints. As an important title in cinema studies, The Landscape of Hollywood Westerns explains much about Americaâ€™s obsession with mythic heroes, those menâ€”as the popular song resoundsâ€”who want to live in the wide open spaces, under starry skies at night.",2007,Film & History: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Film and Television Studies

The Tectonic Development of the Southern Beaufort Sea and Its Relationship to the Origin of the Arctic Ocean Basin,"Abstract Seismic reflection and gravity data suggest that the structural and stratigraphic framework of the northern Canadian Cordillera and adjacent Interior Platform continue seaward onto the continental shelf along the southern rim of the Beaufort Sea. The structural style of the region, manifested in faults with reverse, strike and normal separations, is related to: 1. An array of Early Cretaceous, right-lateral faults which lies on the extension of the Kaltag Fault, and continues onto Beaufort Shelf. There, in addition to strike-slip displacement, many faults have normal separations with their southeast sides down. 2. Late Cretaceous and Tertiary extensional faults on the northwest flank of the Aklavik Arch which complement the Early Cretaceous array and resulted in the development of a structural depression between these two temporally and spatially separated families of faults. Collectively they provided a site for the deposition of the thick, Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary molassoid succession in the vicinity of the modern Mackenzie Delta. This faulting may be related to the initial, asymmetric opening of the Arctic Ocean Basin during the Mesozoic about an axis approximately parallel to and seaward from the northern continental margin. A re-evaluation of magnetic and gravity information in the northern Queen Elizabeth Islands, in addition to rationalizing the structures of the southern Beaufort Sea in terms of such an opening, suggests that the Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary succession along the southern rim of the Beaufort Sea developed in response to extensional tectonics along the continental margin.",1975,
Polygenic scores using summary statistics via penalized regression,"Polygenic scores (PGS) summarize the genetic contribution of a personâ€™s genotype to a disease or phenotype. They are useful in a wide variety of analyses of genetic data. Many possible ways of calculating polygenic scores have been proposed, and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate information available in published summary statistics. As there is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in summary statistics, a pertinent question is whether we can make use of LD information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To answer this question we proposed a method for constructing PGS using summary statistics and a reference panel in a penalized regression framework, which we called lassosum. We also proposed a general method for choosing the value of the tuning parameter in the absence of validation data. Our simulation results suggested that lassosum is faster and more robust than other similar methods in most scenarios. We also found that accounting for LD with a reference panel is beneficial only when the signals from the data are strong. In the presence of summary statistics from a large number of SNPs, clumping may both enhance or decrease the performance of standard PGS, although its effects on lassosum is attenuated. lassosum combined with pre-filtering by clumping appears to be a robust and reliable option for calculating predictive PGS.",2016,bioRxiv

RESUMEN
La presente memoria estudia la estabilidad estructural de ternas de matrices. Es bien conocido que los sistemas dinamicos lineales con coeficientes constantes pueden venir definidos por ternas de matrices, de ahi el interes de este estudio.
En particular, se dan en la memoria distintas condiciones necesarias y suficientes para que una terna de matrices sea estructuralmente estable con respecto de una relacion de equivalencia previamente introducida en el espacio de ternas de matrices, bien a partir de su forma reducida canonica, bien por otros metodos.
En este estudio se utilizan de forma basica las deformaciones miniversales de ternas de matrices, lo cual es posible puesto que se ve la relacion de equivalencia considerada en el espacio de ternas de matrices como la inducida por la accion de un grupo de lie en la variedad diferenciable del espacio de ternas de matrices.
El estudio de los casos de ternas de matrices no estructuralmente estables para las cuales la dimension de la deformacion miniversal es inferior o igual a tres sugiere una nueva particion del espacio de ternas de matrices (que se demuestra que es una estratificacion) y una nueva relacion de equivalencia, la asociada a esta ultima particion. Se caracterizan tambien las ternas de matrices estructuralmente estables respecto de esta nueva relacion de equivalencia. Finalmente, se estudian los casos de las ternas que no son estructuralmente estables respecto de esta ultima relacion en los casos en que la dimension de una familia minitransversal al estrato tiene dimension inferior o igual a tres, familia que ha sido previamente encontrada.
En todo el estudio realizado se utiliza un nuevo sistema completo de invariantes para una terna de matrices, cuya principal caracteristica es que todos los invariantes discretos del sistema vienen dados en funcion del rango de unas ciertas matrices asociadas a las matrices que componen la terna. La definicion de estas matrices y la demostracion de que es un sistema completo de invariantes constituye la primera parte de la memoria.",1997,
Convex Penalization in Sparse Recovery,"We will discuss the role of penalized empirical risk minimization with convex 3 penalties in sparse recovery problems. This includes the `1-norm (LASSO) penalty 4 as well as strictly convex and smooth penalties, such as the negative entropy penalty 5 for sparse recovery in convex hulls. The goal is to show that, when the target 6 function can be well approximated by a â€œsparseâ€ linear combination of functions 7 from a given dictionary, then solutions of penalized empirical risk minimization 8 problems with `1 and some other convex penalties are â€œapproximately sparseâ€ and 9 they approximate the target function with an error that depends on the â€œsparsityâ€. 10 As a result of this analysis, we derive sparsity oracle inequalities showing the 11 dependence of the excess risk of the empirical solution on the underlying sparsity 12 of the problem. These inequalities also involve various distribution dependent 13 geometric characteristics of the dictionary (such as restricted isometry constants 14 and alignment coefficients) and the error of sparse recovery crucially depends on 15 the geometry of the dictionary.",2011,
Fuel Oil Effects on Antioxidant Enzymes and Immunological Responses in the Fish Thalassophryne maculosa (Pisces: Batrochoididae),"With the aim of investigate the acute effects of two concentrations (25 and 100%) of N. 6 fuel oil-water-accommodated fraction (OWAF) on antioxidant enzyme activities and immunological responses, fishes Thalassophryne maculosa were sampled from the La Restiga Lagoon, Margarita island, in eastern Venezuela. The antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were measured in liver and gills. The macrophagic phagocytosis and antibacterial lysozyme activity of anterior kidney were the immune parameters examined. Increases in gill GST activity and hepatic GR activity were observed after the exposure to 25 and 100% OWAF, respectively. GPX, CAT and immune responses were not affected by the experimental treatments. Our results demonstrated that among the antioxidant enzymes tested, GR and GST activities were the most sensible to the acute treatment with fuel oil, indicating changes in the redox cellular state that may result in oxidative stress in T. maculosa.",2006,Journal of The Brazilian Society of Ecotoxicology
Gene regulatory network inference using sparse probabilistic models,"The main task of systems biology is to uncover mechanisms that regulate complex processes that take place in biological cells, especially the mechanisms of gene regulation. This project aims to identify gene regulatory interactions taking place in the early development of neural tube. Solutions proposed in this work for identification of transcription factors and their target genes are mostly based on Bayesian sparse linear models. Sparse linear regression is used to predict gene expression given a set of transcription factor expressions. Even though transcriptional regulation mechanisms are frequently non-linear, a sparse linear regression model succeeds in identifying some of the transcription factors that are already known to play role in the studied biological processes. The probabilistic sparse model is compared to its frequentist equivalent, the lasso. Both algorithms are evaluated on neural tube development data and Bayesian model produces superior results. The probabilistic sparse linear model is also extended to take into account non-linear interactions between transcription factors. A simple interaction model is presented and it is integrated into the probabilistic sparse linear model. The resulting model is a novel method to incorporate non-linearity into linear regression. Variational approximate inference algorithm is derived for the extended model with transcription factor interactions. This model is then applied to a subset of potentially important transcription factors and it succeeds to find a very sparse solution. Again, the results from the extended model succeed to identify transcription factors that seem to have important role. Both probabilistic models for gene regulation provide a set of straightforwardly testable predictions of potentially interesting transcription factors.",2011,
Improving Survey Response Rates from Chief Executive Officers in Small Firms: The Importance of Social Networks:,"Evaluates the effect of social networks on survey responserates in small firms. After a review of trends in survey research onentrepreneurs and small firms, three hypotheses are proposed. Taken together,the hypotheses predict that endorsement from relevant professionalassociations, geographic proximity between the firm and the sponsoringuniversity, and the researcher's social and professional ties to the firm'sregion will have a positive effect on response rates. Data from a survey of 203 small firms are used to test the hypotheses. Whilethe data indicate that endorsements and the researcher's ties to the firm'sregion do indeed improve response rates, there is no evidence that geographicproximity does the same. Overall, the results suggest that social networks havean impact on survey response rates. (SAA)",2006,Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice
Status and threats on seagrass beds using GIS in Vietnam,"Seagrasses, marine flowering plants, are widely distributed along temperate and tropical coastlines of the world. Seagrasses have key ecological roles in coastal ecosystems and can form extensive meadows supporting high biodiversity. Till now, fourteen seagrass species belonging to four families were found in Vietnam: Halophila beccarii, H. decipiens, H. ovalis, H. minor, Thalassia hemprichii, Enhalus acoroides, Ruppia maritima, Halodule pinifolia, H. uninervis, Syringodium isoetifolium, Cymadocea rotundata, C. serrulata and Thalassodendron ciliatum. A total area of seagrass beds in Vietnam is estimated to be approximately 17000 ha by satellite images and GIS technology. In recent years, the distribution areas and densities of seagrass beds in Vietnam have been serious decreased compared with those 10-15 years ago. The decline level depended on the impacts by the natural process, the economical activities and the conservation awareness of local people. Thus, it is different at each coastal area. Generally speaking, the distribution areas and densities of seagrass beds were decreased by more than 50%. Seagrasses on tidal flats in some areas such as Quang Ninh, Hai Phong, Phu Quoc seem to be nearly lost. The distribution areas of seagrass beds in 2009 at Tam Giang-Cau Hai lagoon and Cua Dai estuary was decreased by 50-70% of those in early 1990s.",2012,
Bedeutung der Proteindisulfidisomerase fÃ¼r die AktivitÃ¤t des Tissue Factor auf AML-Zellen,"Bei Patienten mit Akuter Myeloischer Leukamie (AML) kommt es uberproportional haufig zu systemischen Koapulopathien. Fur die Therapie und Prophylaxe dieser Komplikationen ware ein genaues Verstandnis des zugrundeliegenden pathophysiologischen Mechanismus wichtig. Es gilt als gesichert, dass einer Uberexpression von Tissue Factor (TF), dem physiologischen Initiator der extrinsischen Gerinnungskaskade, auf AML-Zellen eine zentrale Rolle zukommt. 
 TF kann auf intravaskularen Zellen in einer kryptischen, nicht prokoagulatorischen Form und in einer aktiven, prokoagulatorischen Form vorliegen. Bisher ist nicht bekannt, worin sich die kryptische und die aktive Form strukturell voneinander unterscheiden und welches die entscheidenden Stimuli zur Umwandlung der kryptischen in die aktive Form sind. 
Ahamed et al. haben 2006 die These aufgestellt, dass der Aktivitatszustand des TF vom Redoxzustand einer Disulfidbrucke in der extrazellularen Domane des TF abhangt und dass dieser Redoxzustand durch die Proteindisulfidisomerase (PDI) reguliert wird. Dies wird in anderen Arbeiten wiederum angezweifelt; stattdessen soll die Expression von Phosphatidylserin (PS) der entscheidende Ausloser zur TF-Aktivierung sein. 
 Diese Erklarungsmodelle sollten an den myeloblastischen Zelllinien HL60 und THP1 untersucht werden. Es sollten die Auswirkungen einer Hemmung der PDI durch den spezifischen Hemmstoff Rutin und durch den unspezifischeren Thiolisomerasen-Hemmer Bacitracin untersucht werden. Die inhibitorische Potenz dieser Hemmstoffen wurde zuvor in einem Insulinreduktions-Assay mit einer IC50 fur Rutin von 14Â ÂµM und fur Bacitracin von 600Â ÂµM bestatigt. Nach einer Inkubation der HL60-Zellen mit Rutin 100Â ÂµM oder Bacitracin 5Â mM uber 20 Minuten kam es zu einer Abnahme der prokoagulatorischen Aktivitat (PCA). Eine Inkubation derselben Zelllinie uber 24Â h fuhrte dagegen zu einer deutlichen PCA-Steigerung, was sich sowohl in der Messung der direkten zellassoziierten PCA als auch in der Messung der PCA der freigesetzten Mikropartikel widerspiegelte. Dieses Phanomen wurde begleitet von einer vermehrten PS-Exposition. Es lasst sich also schlussfolgern, dass die PDI auf diesen Zellen sowohl mit TF als auch mit PS in Wechselwirkung steht. Auf THP1-Zellen ergab weder die 20-minutige noch die 24-stundige Inkubation mit Rutin oder Bacitracin alleine wesentliche Veranderungen der PCA oder der PS-Exposition. Allerdings bewirkte die Gegenwart eines PDI-Inhibitors, dass sich die von dem Chemotherapeutikum Daunorubicin (DNR) normalerweise ausgeloste PCA-Steigerung nicht in vollem Ausmas einstellen konnte. Auf diesen Zellen ist die PDI unter physiologischen Bedingungen fur die TF-PCA ohne Bedeutung, jedoch geschieht die DNR-initiierte PCA-Steigerung offenbar unter Vermittlung der PDI. 
 Dass das Verhalten beider Zelllinien nach PDI-Hemmung auf AML-Zellen aus Patientenproben reproduziert werden konnte, bestatigt die klinische Relevanz dieser Ergebnisse und macht die PDI zu einem vielversprechenden Angriffspunkt therapeutischer Masnahmen.",2014,
The quantile process under random censoring D iscussion P aper,"In this paper we discuss the asymptotical properties of quantile processes under random censoring. In contrast to most work in this area we prove weak convergence of an appropriately standardized quantile process under the assumption that the quantile regression model is only linear in the region, where the process is investigated. Additionally, we also discuss properties of the quantile process in sparse regression models including quantile processes obtained from the Lasso and adaptive Lasso. The results are derived by a combination of modern empirical process theory, classical martingale methods and a recent result of Kato (2009).",2012,

Sup-norm convergence rate and sign concentration property of Lasso and Dantzig estimators,We derive the l! convergence rate simultaneously for Lasso and Dantzig estimators in a high-dimensional linear regression model under a mutual coherence assumption on the Gram matrix of the design and two di! erent assumptions on the noise: Gaussian noise and general noise with finite variance. Then we prove that simultaneously the thresholded Lasso and Dantzig estimators with a proper choice of the threshold enjoy a sign concentration property provided that the non-zero components of the target vector are not too small.,2008,Electronic Journal of Statistics
Validation of miRNAs as Breast Cancer Biomarkers with a Machine Learning Approach,"Certain small noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) are differentially expressed in normal tissues and cancers, which makes them great candidates for biomarkers for cancer. Previously, a selected subset of miRNAs has been experimentally verified to be linked to breast cancer. In this paper, we validated the importance of these miRNAs using a machine learning approach on miRNA expression data. We performed feature selection, using Information Gain (IG), Chi-Squared (CHI2) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operation (LASSO), on the set of these relevant miRNAs to rank them by importance. We then performed cancer classification using these miRNAs as features using Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Our results demonstrated that the miRNAs ranked higher by our analysis had higher classifier performance. Performance becomes lower as the rank of the miRNA decreases, confirming that these miRNAs had different degrees of importance as biomarkers. Furthermore, we discovered that using a minimum of three miRNAs as biomarkers for breast cancers can be as effective as using the entire set of 1800 miRNAs. This work suggests that machine learning is a useful tool for functional studies of miRNAs for cancer detection and diagnosis.",2019,Cancers
Semiocladius Sublette and Wirth: taxonomy and ecology of an estuarine midge (Diptera: Chironomidae: Orthocladiinae),"emiocladius Sublette and Wirth, described from adult midges from south-western Pacific Ocean shores, has the Australian Camptocladius crassipennis Skuse as its type. Immature stages previously known only from Semiocladius kuscheli Sublette and Wirth from sub-Antarctic New Zealand were associated tentatively, by co-occurrence. For the first time, the immature stages for the Australian species are associated definitively by rearing. Larvae rear to a pupa identical to a speculatively associated exuviae of Semiocladius from Lord Howe Island. Adults conform to the described S.Â crassipennis. Larval Semiocladius are distinctive and previous diagnoses are confirmed. In contrast, the putatively associated pupa of S.Â kuscheli is indistinguishable from that of the marine intertidal Thalassosmittia Strenke and Remmert, whereas the newly associated S.Â crassipennis pupa is distinct. The pupa of S.Â kuscheli may have been misassociated. Semiocladius live in the mesohaline of the salinity gradient of the Clyde River estuary, south-east Australia and the genus appears to be a distinctive western Pacific saline/mesohaline taxon.",2005,Australian Journal of Entomology
