Incidence and Predictors of Unsuspected Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Lymph Node Metastases After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Patients with Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"BackgroundRadical lymph node (LN) dissection along the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) area carries a substantial morbidity rate, and its usefulness in neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT)-treated esophageal cancer patients remains unclear.MethodsThis study was conducted in two Asian thoracic surgery centers. Patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who were judged to be ycN-RLN(√¢ÀÜ‚Äô) after nCRT and received bilateral RLN LN dissection were eligible. The incidence of unsuspected RLN LN involvement was analyzed, and we used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to identify its predictors.ResultsA total of 56 patients (53 males and 3 females; mean age: 55√Ç¬†years) were included. The upper mediastinum√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùincluding the bilateral RLN area√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùwas covered by the radiation field in 48 (85.3%) patients. Although all of them were judged as ycN-RLN(√¢ÀÜ‚Äô), unsuspected RLN LN involvement was identified on pathological examination in 11 (19.6%) subjects, being the only positive nodal station in seven. LASSO regression identified the pre-nCRT RLN LN(cN-RLN) status as the only independent predictor of ypN-RLN positivity; in contrast, neither the tumor location nor the radiation dose to the upper mediastinum were independently associated with ypN-RLN(+). RLN nodal dissection resulted in positive LN discovery rates of 30.8 and 10% in ycN-RLN(√¢ÀÜ‚Äô) patients who had positive and negative cN-RLNs before nCRT, respectively. Consequently, 23.1 and 6.7% of patients in each subgroup would have been understaged in the absence of RLN nodal dissection.ConclusionNearly one-fifth of ESCC patients who were judged to be ycN-RLN(√¢ÀÜ‚Äô) unexpectedly had positive ypN-RLN. The pre-nCRT cN-RLN status plays a key role in the selection of patients that should undergo RLN LN dissection after nCRT.",2018,World Journal of Surgery
"An Encounter with Mehdi Belhaj Kacem, Transgression and the Inexistent: A Philosophical Vocabulary","Although Mehdi Belhaj Kacem is not often included in lists of contemporary French philosophers that appear in English-language works on the subject√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùlists that privilege names like Badiou, Laruelle, Malabou, Stiegler, Meillassoux, and now Garcia√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthe appearance of his first translated book may indeed grant him a place on those lists.

A review of original articles published in the emerging field of radiomics.,"PURPOSE
To determine the characteristics of and trends in research in the emerging field of radiomics through bibliometric and hotspot analyses of relevant original articles published between 2013 and 2018.


METHODS
We evaluated 553 original articles concerning radiomics, published in a total of 61 peer-reviewed journals between 2013 and 2018. The following information was retrieved for each article: radiological subspecialty, imaging technique(s), machine learning technique(s), sample size, study setting and design, statistical result(s), study purpose, software used for feature calculation, funding declarations, author number, first author's affiliation, study origin, and journal name. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed for the manually extracted data for identification and visualization of the trends in radiomics research.


RESULTS
The annual growth rate in the number of published papers was 177.82% (p < 0.001). The characteristics and trends of research hotspots in the field of radiomics were clarified and visualized in this study. It was found that the field of radiomics is at a more mature stage for lung, breast, and prostate cancers than for other sites. Radiomics studies primarily focused on radiological characterization (215) and monitoring (182). Logistic regression and LASSO were the two most commonly used techniques for feature selection. Non-clinical researchers without a medical background dominated radiomics studies (70.52%), the vast majority of which only highlighted positive results (97.80%) while downplaying negative findings.


CONCLUSIONS
The reporting of quantifiable knowledge about the characteristics and trajectories of radiomics can inform researchers about the gaps in the field of radiomics and guide its future direction.",2020,European journal of radiology
Biomarkers of Environmental Enteropathy are Positively Associated with Immune Responses to an Oral Cholera Vaccine in Bangladeshi Children,"Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a poorly understood condition that refers to chronic alterations in intestinal permeability, absorption, and inflammation, which mainly affects young children in resource-limited settings. Recently, EE has been linked to suboptimal oral vaccine responses in children, although immunological mechanisms are poorly defined. The objective of this study was to determine host factors associated with immune responses to an oral cholera vaccine (OCV). We measured antibody and memory T cell immune responses to cholera antigens, micronutrient markers in blood, and EE markers in blood and stool from 40 Bangladeshi children aged 3-14 years who received two doses of OCV given 14 days apart. EE markers included stool myeloperoxidase (MPO) and alpha anti-trypsin (AAT), and plasma endotoxin core antibody (EndoCab), intestinal fatty acid binding protein (i-FABP), and soluble CD14 (sCD14). We used multiple linear regression analysis with LASSO regularization to identify host factors, including EE markers, micronutrient (nutritional) status, age, and HAZ score, predictive for each response of interest. We found stool MPO to be positively associated with IgG antibody responses to the B subunit of cholera toxin (P = 0.03) and IgA responses to LPS (P = 0.02); plasma sCD14 to be positively associated with LPS IgG responses (P = 0.07); plasma i-FABP to be positively associated with LPS IgG responses (P = 0.01) and with memory T cell responses specific to cholera toxin (P = 0.01); stool AAT to be negatively associated with IL-10 (regulatory) T cell responses specific to cholera toxin (P = 0.02), and plasma EndoCab to be negatively associated with cholera toxin-specific memory T cell responses (P = 0.02). In summary, in a cohort of children 3-14 years old, we demonstrated that the majority of biomarkers of environmental enteropathy were positively associated with immune responses after vaccination with an OCV.",2016,PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
Higher-order Weighted Graph Convolutional Networks,"Graph Convolution Network (GCN) has been recognized as one of the most effective graph models for semi-supervised learning, but it extracts merely the first-order or few-order neighborhood information through information propagation, which suffers performance drop-off for deeper structure. Existing approaches that deal with the higher-order neighbors tend to take advantage of adjacency matrix power. In this paper, we assume a seemly trivial condition that the higher-order neighborhood information may be similar to that of the first-order neighbors. Accordingly, we present an unsupervised approach to describe such similarities and learn the weight matrices of higher-order neighbors automatically through Lasso that minimizes the feature loss between the first-order and higher-order neighbors, based on which we formulate the new convolutional filter for GCN to learn the better node representations. Our model, called higher-order weighted GCN(HWGCN), has achieved the state-of-the-art results on a number of node classification tasks over Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed datasets.",2019,ArXiv

A late antique ceramic workshop complex: evidence for workshop organisation at Sagalassos (southwest Turkey),"Sites of ceramic production have been discovered throughout the area that was once the Roman Empire; as a result, it is becoming increasingly clear that this industry was, in the Roman and late antique worlds, organised in numerous ways. In consideration of the organisational diversity in ceramic production attested during the period, this article presents some of the findings from the excavations of a late antique complex of ceramic workshops at the site of Sagalassos in order to consider archaeological evidence in terms of, not only the organisation of the manufacturing process, but also structures of workshop decision-making. Several lines of archaeological evidence are outlined, and argue for a model of independent work units integrated into a larger organisational structure of decision-making, and possibly even ownership, across the complex. In addition, the motivation to invest in a multi-workshop complex during the late antique period at Sagalassos is contextualised within the wider history of local and regional economic development.",2016,Anatolian studies

Monotone regression in high (and lower) dimensions,"In this thesis, we first present an overview of monotone regression, both in the classical setting and in the high dimensional setting. High dimensional data means that the number of covariates, p, exceeds the number of observations, n. It is often reasonable to assume a monotone relationship between a predictor variable and the response, especially in medicine and biology. The monotone regression methods for the high dimensional data setting that are considered are the liso regression method and the monotone splines lasso regression method (to our knowledge, the only two methods). Both these methods are special forms of penalised regression. The performances of these two high dimensional methods in the classical setting are studied and compared to the performances of existing methods for monotone regression developed for the classical setting, known as MonBoost, scam and scar. The two high dimensional methods work well also in the classical setting, but they do not outperform the existing methods. The two methods can still be useful in the classical setting, since they can be used in situations where the monotonicity directions of the effects are not known, in contrast to the existing methods and also perform automatic variable selection. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of the monotone splines lasso method to the number of interior knots used to fit the monotone splines and find that it is very robust. In addition, two new methods for fitting a partially linear model where the non-linear covariates are assumed to have a monotone effect on the response are developed. These two methods can be used in the setting where p > n as well as in the classical setting. To our knowledge, no such methods have been developed in the past. The first method, PLAMM-1, is a straight forward extension of the monotone splines lasso method to the partially linear setting. The second method developed, PLAMM-2, is a method with two penalties, one on the linear parameters and one on the non-linear parameters. In this last case, estimation has to be performed iteratively, and we prove convergence of the iterative scheme. The estimation, selection and prediction performances of the methods are investigated by simulation experiments in different settings. Through the simulation experiments, the methods are shown to work well in both the classical settings and in the high dimensional setting where the number of observations is not too small. We also apply the partially linear monotone model to a medical dataset where clinical covariates enter the linear part and genomic covariates are assumed to have a monotone effect on the outcome.",2016,
"Growth and sexual strategies in the fishThalassoma duperrey (Labridae), a protogynous hermaphrodite","SynopsisAdults of the fishThalassoma duperrey, a protogynous hermaphrodite, were collected and growth observed in captivity to study the relationship between growth and reproduction among primary males, females, and secondary males. Sexual maturity is reached at about 60 mm standard length, probably less than 1 year after fertilization. Gonosomatic index in both males and females peaks at about 120 mm, nearly 2 years later. Shortly thereafter females typically change sex, and both primary and secondary males undergo color change. At the same time gonosomatic index falls abruptly and remains low in large fish. The above changes appear to reflect differences in reproductive effort over a lifetime and are interpreted as the optimum strategy given the social and mating system of this fish. Unless they cannot acquire enough food to develop large gonads, small individuals put a much greater proportion of energy into growth than reproduction apparently to minimize the period of low fitness. Intermediate-sized males and females generally invest heavily in gametes, though some retain small gonads. Large individuals (both primary and secondary males) greatly reduce their investment in gametes, probably trading the energy required to maintain reproductive territories for it. This kind of gonad ontogeny involving gonad regression, as inT. duperrey and other labrid fishes, is unique among vertebrates.",2004,Environmental Biology of Fishes
The Behavioral Physiology of Labroid Fishes.,"Abstract : The cunner Tautogolabrus adspersus is one of two temperate-dwelling Western North Atlantic labrid fishes, and is one of the few fishes that remain in New England waters throughout the year. Observations indicate that cunner enter behavioral torpor in winter. The present study showed that cunner undergo physiological torpor, or hibernation, based on low oxygen consumption rates, contributing to a large Q10 value of 8.5. This establishes cunner as one of the few marine species that hibernate. Cunner withstood four months of starvation at 4 deg C. Glycogen, lipid, and protein in the liver decreased during this period, but remained unchanged in whole-body samples. Regression analysis predicts that cunner can live at least 6 months on their glycogen and lipid reserves, and 9 months based on their protein reserves. Cunner maintained a diel cycle in oxygen consumption rates (low at night, high during the day) during periods of warm temperature, but the cycle approximated 48 hours at temperatures generally below 8 deg C. Two tropical labroids, Thalassoma bifasciatum and Scarus iserti, also had a diel cycle in metabolic rate. The ability of labrids to undergo marked diel decreases in metabolic rate may have predisposed them to becoming established in temperate waters by surviving cold temperatures through hibernation....

Structures of thymidine kinase 1 of human and mycoplasmic origin.,"Cytosolic thymidine kinase 1, TK1, is a well known cell-cycle-regulated enzyme of importance in nucleotide metabolism as well as an activator of antiviral and anticancer drugs such as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT). We have now determined the structures of the TK1 family, the human and Ureaplasma urealyticum enzymes, in complex with the feedback inhibitor dTTP. The TK1s have a tetrameric structure in which each subunit contains an alpha/beta-domain that is similar to ATPase domains of members of the RecA structural family and a domain containing a structural zinc. The zinc ion connects beta-structures at the root of a beta-ribbon that forms a stem that widens to a lasso-type loop. The thymidine of dTTP is hydrogen-bonded to main-chain atoms predominantly coming from the lasso loop. This binding is in contrast to other deoxyribonucleoside kinases where specific interactions occur with side chains. The TK1 structure differs fundamentally from the structures of the other deoxyribonucleoside kinases, indicating a different evolutionary origin.",2004,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Modeling Nonstationary Processes Through Dimension Expansion,"In this article, we propose a novel approach to modeling nonstationary spatial fields. The proposed method works by expanding the geographic plane over which these processes evolve into higher-dimensional spaces, transforming and clarifying complex patterns in the physical plane. By combining aspects of multidimensional scaling, group lasso, and latent variable models, a dimensionally sparse projection is found in which the originally nonstationary field exhibits stationarity. Following a comparison with existing methods in a simulated environment, dimension expansion is studied on a classic test-bed dataset historically used to study nonstationary models. Following this, we explore the use of dimension expansion in modeling air pollution in the United Kingdom, a process known to be strongly influenced by rural/urban effects, amongst others, which gives rise to a nonstationary field.",2010,Journal of the American Statistical Association

Macro-Invertebrates (Annelida; Oligochaeta) As Bio-Indicator of Water Quality under Temperate Climatic Conditions,"The present research work deals with the distribution of benthic macro-invertebrates (Annelida; Oligochaeta) in relation to water quality of Anchar lake. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of benthic macro-invertebrates showed the presence of three species viz. Limnodrilus hoffmeister, Erpobdella octoculata and Glassophonia complanata in the lake. Among the three species Limnodrilus hoffmeister belonged to class Oligochaeta whereas Erpobdella octoculata and Glassophonia complanata belonged to class Hirudinea. The occurrence of these species in higher number is due to the presence of organic rich waters and entry of sewage, which favours growth of these worms. The distribution of these organisms is generally influenced by Nitrogen (NO3 and NH4) along with phosphorus. The distribution of Limnodrilus sp showed positive correlation with NO3-N and NH4.-N (p√¢‚Ä∞¬§0.05, r = 0.429) and (p√¢‚Ä∞¬§0.05, r = 0.324) respectively. This indicates that both N & P are important factor for abundance and presence of Limnodrilus hoffmeister, Erpobdella octoculata and Glassophonia complanata. Dissolved Oxygen and free CO2 are also found to be an influential factor in affecting the distribution of Annelida especially Limnodrilus sp. Which showed strong negative correlation with dissolved oxygen (p√¢‚Ä∞¬§0.01, r = 0.770) and strong positive correlation with free CO2 (p√¢‚Ä∞¬§0.01, r = 0.741). The study reveals that macro-invertebrates especially Oligochaetes can be used as indicator of water quality because they are found in lake with contaminated water quality.",2018,International Journal of Pure & Applied Bioscience
Transzendentalphilosophie und Idealismus in der Ph√É¬§nomenologie,"The treatment of the question of transcendental idealism mirrors the different self-understandings of phenomenology in the 21st century. While in the context of French phenomenology it has been announced that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìidealism is overcome√¢‚Ç¨¬ù (Tengelyi) by a phenomenology of meaning-events, in the context of philosophy of mind, Husserl√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s philosophy is appreciated as the most thought-out form of a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsupervenience-idealism√¢‚Ç¨¬ù (Meixner). It is clear that Husserl√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s anti-representational theory of intentionality is not to be confused with any other √¢‚Ç¨≈ìgarden varieties√¢‚Ç¨¬ù of idealism, but does that mean that we should better avoid the term altogether (Zahavi) and only talk about √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe transcendental√¢‚Ç¨¬ù? The paper wants to get clear about this question by sharply contrasting Kant√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s transcendental idealism with Husserl√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s transcendental idealism. The decisive difference is that for Kant appearance has its ground in something which is absolutely independent of experience, which makes him a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìfundamental realist√¢‚Ç¨¬ù (Allais) apart from his empirical realism; Husserl, by contrast, who argues that transcendentally reduced consciousness has √¢‚Ç¨≈ìno outside√¢‚Ç¨¬ù anymore, insists that the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthing in itself√¢‚Ç¨¬ù is a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcounter-sensical√¢‚Ç¨¬ù thought.My thesis is thus that it is a misunderstanding to believe that in phenomenology there is a similar potential for drawing a limit against√Ç¬† metaphysics as there is in Kant√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s conception of the transcendental. Is such a limitation nevertheless necessary? And is it maybe implied in genetic phenomenology which claims that subjectivity develops in its interaction with the world and other subjects? While I do not agree that phenomenology√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s idealistic constellation is tied to a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsovereign subject√¢‚Ç¨¬ù and that relocating the constitutional force on other side of the correlation could solve the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìproblem,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù I believe that we have to take seriously the transcendental stakes in phenomenology, which, in the form of a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìstrong√Ç¬† correlationism√¢‚Ç¨¬ù (Meillassoux), is still the best line of defense against a naturalization of consciousness, the world and intersubjectivity .",2015,
Using Population-Size Estimation and Cross-sectional Survey Methods to Evaluate HIV Service Coverage Among Key Populations in Burkina Faso and Togo,"Objectives: The objective of our study was to measure progress toward the UNAIDS 90-90-90 HIV care targets among key populations in urban areas of 2 countries in West Africa: Burkina Faso and Togo. Methods: We recruited female sex workers (FSWs) and men who have sex with men (MSM) through respondent-driven sampling. From January to July 2013, 2738 participants were enrolled, tested for HIV, and completed interviewer-administered surveys. We used population-size estimation methods to calculate the number of people who were engaged in the HIV continuum of care. Results: HIV prevalence ranged from 0.6% (2 of 329) of MSM in Kara, Togo, to 32.9% (115 of 350) of FSWs in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Of those confirmed to be HIV infected, a range of 0.0% (0 of 2) of MSM in Kara to 55.7% (64 of 115) of FSWs in Bobo Dioulasso were using ART. Based on population estimates, the percentage gap between HIV-infected people who should be using ART (per the 90-90-90 targets) and those who reported using ART ranged from 31.5% among FSWs in Bobo Dioulasso to 100.0% among MSM in Kara. Conclusions: HIV service coverage among MSM and FSWs in Burkina Faso and Togo was low in 2013. Interventions for improving engagement of these at-risk populations in the HIV continuum of care should include frequent, routine HIV testing and linkage to evidence-based HIV treatment services. Population-size estimates can be used to inform governments, policy makers, and funding agencies about where elements of HIV service coverage are most needed.",2016,Public Health Reports
Symplectic Euler Method for Nonlinear High Order Schr √Ç¬® odinger Equation with a Trapped Term,"Abstract. In this paper, we establish a family of symplectic integrators for a classof high order Schrodinger equations with trapped terms. First, we √Ø¬¨¬Ånd its symplec-√Ç¬®tic structure and reduce it to a √Ø¬¨¬Ånite dimensional Hamilton system via spatial dis-cretization. Then we apply the symplectic Euler method to the Hamiltonian system.It is demonstrated that the scheme not only preserves symplectic geometry struc-ture of the original system, but also does not require to resolve coupled nonlinearalgebraic equations which is different with the general implicit symplectic schemes.The linear stability of the symplectic Euler scheme and the errors of the numericalsolutions are investigated. It shows that the semi-explicit scheme is conditionallystable, √Ø¬¨¬Årst order accurate in time and 2 l th order accuracy in space. Numerical testssuggest that the symplectic integrators are more effective than non-symplectic ones,such as backward Euler integrators.

Computational Simulation of Adapter Length-Dependent LASSO Probe Capture Efficiency,"Multiplexed cloning of long DNA sequences is a valuable technique in many biotechnology applications, such as long-read genome sequencing and the creation of open reading frame (ORF) libraries. Long-adapter single-stranded oligonucleotide (LASSO) probes have shown promise as a tool to clone long DNA fragments. LASSO probes are molecular inversion probes (MIP) engineered with an adapter region of user-defined length, flanked between template-specific probe sequences. Herein, we demonstrate that the adapter length is a key feature of LASSO that influences the efficiency of gene capture and cloning. Furthermore, we applied a model based on Monte Carlo molecular simulation in order to study the relationship between the long-adapter length of LASSO and capture enrichment. Our results suggest that the adapter length is a factor that contributes to the free energy of target-probe interaction, thereby determining the efficiency of capture. The results indicate that LASSOs with extremely long adapters cannot capture the targets well. They also suggest that targets of different lengths may prefer adapters of different lengths.",2019,Biomolecules
On shakedown of elastic plastic solids,"SommarioFacendo riferimento a un solido elastico perfettamente plastico soggetto a carichi ciclici, si considera il problema del moltiplicatore dei carichi ad adattamento e si studiano le equazioni di Eulero-Lagrange ad esso associate. Si trova che la soluzione di queste equazioni descrive il gradiente, rispetto al moltiplicatore dei carichi, della risposta stazionaria del solido ai carichi ciclici al limite di adattamento, e che quindi essa consente di predire la natura del collasso incipiente, Questi risultati vengono quindi estesi al caso pi√É¬π generale di carichi variabili in un dato dominio.SummaryMaking reference to elastic perfectly plastic solids subjected to cyclic loads, the problem of the shakedown load factor is considered and the relevant Euler-Lagrange equations are discussed. It is proved that the solution to these equations describes the gradient, with respect to the load multiplier, of the steady-state response of the solid body to the cyclic loads at the shakedown limit, and that it thus enables one to predict the nature of the impending collapse. These results are then extended to the more general case of loads varying within a given load domain.",1988,Meccanica
Sparse inverse covariance estimation with the lasso,"We consider the problem of estimating sparse graphs by a lasso penalty applied to the inverse covariance matrix. Using a coordinate descent procedure for the lasso, we develop a simple algorithm| the Graphical Lasso| that is remarkably fast: it solves a 1000 node problem (√Ç¬ª 500; 000 parameters) in at most a minute, and is 30 to 4000 times faster than competing methods. It also provides a conceptual link between the exact problem and the approximation suggested by Meinshausen & B√ã≈ì uhlmann (2006). We illustrate the method on some cell-signaling data from proteomics.",2007,arXiv: Methodology
Long-term survival of advanced triple- negative breast cancers with a dose-intense cyclophosphamide/anthracycline,"AP-HP, Ho√ã‚Ä†pital Saint-Louis, RadiologyDepartment, Paris 75475, FranceBackground: Triple-negative (TN) breast cancers exhibit major initial responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but generally havea poor outcome. Because of the lack of validated drug targets, chemotherapy remains an important therapeutic tool in thesecancers.Methods: We report the survival of two consecutive series of 267 locally advanced breast cancers (LABC) treated with twodifferent neoadjuvant regimens, either a dose-dense and dose-intense cyclophosphamide√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúanthracycline (AC) association(historicallycalled SIM)oraconventional sequentialassociation ofcyclophosphamideandanthracycline,followed bytaxanes(EC-T).We compared pathological responses and survival rates of these two groups and studied their association with tumours features.Results: Although the two regimens showed equivalent pathological complete response (pCR) in the whole population (16 and12%), the SIM regimen yielded a non-statistically higher pCR rate than EC-T (48% vs 24%, P√Ç¬º0.087) in TN tumours. In the SIMprotocol, DFS was statistically higher for TN than for non-TN patients (P√Ç¬º0.019), although we showed that the TN status wasassociated with an increased initial risk of recurrence in both regimens. This effect gradually decreased and after 2 years, TN wasassociated with a significantly decreased likelihood of relapse in SIM-treated LABC (hazard ratio (HR)√Ç¬º0.25 (95% CI: 0.07√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú0.86),P√Ç¬º0.028).Conclusions: AC dose intensification treatment is associated with a very favourable long-term survival rate in TN breast cancers.These observations call for a prospective assessment of such dose-intense AC-based regimens in locally advanced TN tumours.Breast cancers represent a set of highly heterogeneous diseases(Weigelt et al, 2008; Sotiriou and Pusztai, 2009). Ongoing studies arepursuing the identification of the cell of origin as well as genetic andepigenetic changes or alterations in signalling pathways associatedwith each breast cancer subset. Currently, these molecularclassifications are not routinely used in clinical practice and breastcancers are still commonly classified according to oestrogen receptor(ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 status. However, triple-negative (TN) cancer is phenotypically defined by the lack ofexpression of ERA, PR and the absence of HER2 overexpression andamplification. There are not yet any specifically targeted treatmentsfor this type of breast cancer. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is therefore",2014,
Variational Inference for sparse network reconstruction from count data,"In multivariate statistics, the question of finding direct interactions can be formulated as a problem of network inference - or network reconstruction - for which the Gaussian graphical model (GGM) provides a canonical framework. Unfortunately, the Gaussian assumption does not apply to count data which are encountered in domains such as genomics, social sciences or ecology. 
To circumvent this limitation, state-of-the-art approaches use two-step strategies that first transform counts to pseudo Gaussian observations and then apply a (partial) correlation-based approach from the abundant literature of GGM inference. We adopt a different stance by relying on a latent model where we directly model counts by means of Poisson distributions that are conditional to latent (hidden) Gaussian correlated variables. In this multivariate Poisson lognormal-model, the dependency structure is completely captured by the latent layer. This parametric model enables to account for the effects of covariates on the counts. 
To perform network inference, we add a sparsity inducing constraint on the inverse covariance matrix of the latent Gaussian vector. Unlike the usual Gaussian setting, the penalized likelihood is generally not tractable, and we resort instead to a variational approach for approximate likelihood maximization. The corresponding optimization problem is solved by alternating a gradient ascent on the variational parameters and a graphical-Lasso step on the covariance matrix. 
We show that our approach is highly competitive with the existing methods on simulation inspired from microbiological data. We then illustrate on three various data sets how accounting for sampling efforts via offsets and integrating external covariates (which is mostly never done in the existing literature) drastically changes the topology of the inferred network.",2019,
Westinghouse Hanford Company quality assurance program and implementation plan,"This is the first revision of the Quality AssurancePlan/Implementation Plan (QAP/IP) for nuclear facilities managedand operated by the Westinghouse Hanford Company (WHC).Development of the initial IP required review of the WHC qualityassurance program to the requirements of the 10 CFR 830.120, andcompletion of initial baseline assessments against the QAP toverify implementation of the program. Each WHC-managed nuclearfacility provided a stand-alone section to the QAP/IP, describingits mission and life-cycle status. WHC support organizationsalso performed assessments for their lead areas, and providedinputs to a separate stand-alone section with the initialbaseline assessment results. In this first revision, the initialbaseline matrixes for those facilities found to be in compliancewith the QAP have been removed. Tank Waste Remediation System(TWRS) and K Basins have modified their baseline matrixes to showcompletion of action items to date. With the followingexceptions, the WHC-managed nuclear facilities and their supportorganizations were found to have implemented QA programs thatsatisfy the requirements of 10 CFR 830.120.

A hybrid ant lion optimizer with improved Nelder√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúMead algorithm for structural damage detection by improving weighted trace lasso regularization,"Structural damage detection is the kernel technique in deploying structural health monitoring. The structural damage√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúdetection technique using heuristic algorithms has been developed at an astounding pace over the past years. However, some existing structural damage√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúdetection methods are prone to easily fall into the local optimum and to be unstable when they are applied to complex structures. In order to make full use of advantages of heuristic algorithms and overcome abovementioned shortcomings, a hybrid algorithm, which combines the ant lion optimizer with an improved Nelder√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúMead algorithm, is proposed to solve the constrained optimization problem of complex structural damage detection. First, an objective function is established for damage identification using structural modal parameters, that is, frequencies and mode shapes. The solution to the objective function is accurately attained by a newly improved weighted trace lasso which can improve the computing performance and stability of procedure and reduce randomness of weighted coefficients. After assessing the computing performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm using three classical mathematical benchmark functions, two structural damage√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúdetection numerical simulations and a laboratory verification are then conducted to fully assess the structural damage√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúdetection capability of the proposed method. Meanwhile, the equivalent element stiffness-reduction model is introduced to estimate the real damage severities of cracks which are created in laboratory structures and to compare with the structural damage√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúdetection results by the proposed method. The illustrated results show that the proposed hybrid algorithm can locate damage and quantify damage severity more accurately and stably with a good robustness to noise.",2020,Advances in Structural Engineering
Model Selection in Sparse Multi-Dimensional Contingency Tables,"We compare the Lasso method of variable selection in sparse multi-dimensional contingency tables with a new Smooth Lasso method which casts regularization in a standard regression analysis mould, and also with the classical backwards elimination algorithm, which is used in standard software packages. First, we make a general methodological point in relation to model selection with interactions. Next we undertake a simulation study which explores the ability of the three algorithms to identify the correct model. Finally, we analyse a set of comorbidities arising in a study of obesity. The findings do not favour the standard Lasso regardless of the optimization algorithm employed.",2016,
Development and validation of a prognostic classifier based on HIF-1 signaling for hepatocellular carcinoma,"HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1) signaling played a vital role in HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) prognosis. We aimed to establish an accurate risk scoring system for HCC prognosis prediction and treatment guidance. 424 samples from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and 445 samples from GSE14520 dataset were included as the derivation and validation cohort, respectively. In the derivation cohort, prognostic relevant signatures were selected from sixteen HIF-1 related genes and LASSO regression was adopted for model construction. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells were calculated using CIBERSORT algorithm. HIF-1 signaling significantly increased in HCC samples compared with normal tissues. Scoring system based on SLC2A1, ENO1, LDHA and GAPDH exhibited a continuous predictive ability for OS (overall survival) in HCC patients. PCA and t-SNE analysis confirmed a reliable clustering ability of risk score in both cohorts. Patients were classified into high-risk and low-risk groups and the survival outcomes between the two groups showed significant differences. In the derivation cohort, Cox regression indicated the scoring system was an independent predictor for OS, which was validated in the validation cohort. Different infiltrating immune cells fraction and immune scores were also observed in different groups. Herein, a novel integrated scoring system was developed based on HIF-1 related genes, which would be conducive to the precise treatment of patients.",2020,Aging (Albany NY)
C-LASSO Estimator for Generalized Additive Logistic Regression Based on B-Spline,"Generalized Additive logistic Regression model (GALRM) is a very important nonparametric regression model. It can be used for binary classification or for predicting the certainty of a binary outcome by using generalized additive models, which known as modern techniques from statistical learning, and the penalized log-likelihood criterion. In our chapter, we develop an estimation problem for GALRM based on B-spline and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), unlike the traditional solutions; we will express the LASSO problem as a conic quadratic optimization problem which is a well structured convex optimization program, and solve it great and very efficient interior points methods.",2019,
Penalised inference for autoregressive moving average models with time-dependent predictors,"Linear models that contain a time-dependent response and explanatory variables have attracted much interest in recent years. The most general form of the existing approaches is of a linear regression model with autoregressive moving average residuals. The addition of the moving average component results in a complex model with a very challenging implementation. In this paper, we propose to account for the time dependency in the data by explicitly adding autoregressive terms of the response variable in the linear model. In addition, we consider an autoregressive process for the errors in order to capture complex dynamic relationships parsimoniously. To broaden the application of the model, we present an $l_1$ penalized likelihood approach for the estimation of the parameters and show how the adaptive lasso penalties lead to an estimator which enjoys the oracle property. Furthermore, we prove the consistency of the estimators with respect to the mean squared prediction error in high-dimensional settings, an aspect that has not been considered by the existing time-dependent regression models. A simulation study and real data analysis show the successful applications of the model on financial data on stock indexes.",2014,arXiv: Methodology
Lasers and Space Optical Systems (LASSOS) study: application and enabling technologies,"Summary form only given. The Laser and Space Optical Systems (LASSOS) study gathered inputs from military users and technologists to identify over a hundred promising weapon and non-weapon applications for lasers and optical systems which make use of the space environment-either based in space or transiting space. Key enabling technologies for these applications, as well as roadmaps to develop them, as needed, were also identified. Thirty-six high interest concepts were selected during Phase I of the study and nine were examined in more detail in Phase II. Potential multi-mission implementations were investigated and potential acquisition strategies and demonstrations were suggested. A more detailed investigation of the multi-mission utility of relay mirrors was recommended. Study results were briefed to the Air Force Major Commands, from which requirements advocacy was sought. Expanded interactions between warfighters and technologists, as experienced during the study, were encouraged.",2000,
The Elemental Past,"In a 1951 debate that marked the beginnings of the analytic-continental divide, Maurice Merleau-Ponty sided with Georges Bataille in rejecting A. J. Ayer√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s claim that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe sun existed before human beings.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù This rejection is already anticipated in a controversial passage from Merleau-Ponty√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Phenomenology of Perception, where he claims that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthere is no world without an Existence that bears its structure.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù I defend Merleau-Ponty√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s counterintuitive position against naturalistic and anti-subjectivist critics by arguing that the world emerges in the exchange between perceiver and perceived. A deeper challenge is posed, however, by Quentin Meillassoux, who argues that the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcorrelationism√¢‚Ç¨¬ù of contemporary philosophy rules out any account of the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìancestral√¢‚Ç¨¬ù time that antedates all subjectivity. Against Meillassoux, and taking an encounter with fossils as my guide, I hold that the past prior to subjectivity can only be approached phenomenologically. The paradoxical character of this immemorial past, as a memory of the world rather than of the subject, opens the way toward a phenomenology of the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìelemental√¢‚Ç¨¬ù past. Drawing on Merleau-Ponty√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s descriptions of the absolute past of nature and the anonymity of the body, as well as Levinas√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ account of the elements at the end of the world, I argue that our own materiality and organic lives participate in the differential rhythms of the elements, opening us to a memory of the world that binds the cosmic past and the apocalyptic future.",2014,Research in Phenomenology
Model uncertainty and variable selection in√Ç¬†Bayesian lasso regression,"While Bayesian analogues of lasso regression have become popular, comparatively little has been said about formal treatments of model uncertainty in such settings. This paper describes methods that can be used to evaluate the posterior distribution over the space of all possible regression models for Bayesian lasso regression. Access to the model space posterior distribution is necessary if model-averaged inference√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùe.g., model-averaged prediction and calculation of posterior variable inclusion probabilities√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùis desired. The key element of all such inference is the ability to evaluate the marginal likelihood of the data under a given regression model, which has so far proved difficult for the Bayesian lasso. This paper describes how the marginal likelihood can be accurately computed when the number of predictors in the model is not too large, allowing for model space enumeration when the total number of possible predictors is modest. In cases where the total number of possible predictors is large, a simple Markov chain Monte Carlo approach for sampling the model space posterior is provided. This Gibbs sampling approach is similar in spirit to the stochastic search variable selection methods that have become one of the main tools for addressing Bayesian regression model uncertainty, and the adaption of these methods to the Bayesian lasso is shown to be straightforward.",2010,Statistics and Computing
"Isolation and structural characterization of capistruin, a lasso peptide predicted from the genome sequence of Burkholderia thailandensis E264.","Lasso peptides are a structurally unique class of bioactive peptides characterized by a knotted arrangement, where the C-terminus threads through an N-terminal macrolactam ring. Although ribosomally synthesized, only the gene cluster for the best studied lasso peptide MccJ25 from Escherichia coli consisting of the precursor protein McjA and the processing and immunity proteins McjB, McjC, and McjD is known. Through genome mining studies, we have identified homologues of all four proteins in Burkholderia thailandensis E264 and predicted this strain to produce a lasso peptide. Here we report the successful isolation of the predicted peptide, named capistruin. Upon optimization of the fermentation conditions, mass spectrometric and NMR structural studies proved capistruin to adopt a novel lasso fold. Heterologous production of the lasso peptide in Escherichia coli showed that the identified genes are sufficient for the biosynthesis of capistruin, which exhibits antimicrobial activity against closely related Burkholderia and Pseudomonas strains. In general, our rational approach should be widely applicable for the isolation of new lasso peptides to explore their high structural stability and diverse biological activity.",2008,Journal of the American Chemical Society
Stochastic algorithm for Bayesian mixture effect template estimation,"The estimation of probabilistic deformable template models in computer vision or of probabilistic atlases in Computational Anatomy are core issues in both fields.

Assessing learning regimes leading to sustainable intensification at the farm level: a new perspective for management assistance for family farms.,"To help design advisory approaches tailored to farmers' needs, we propose to highlight the different learning processes that lead to more sustainable farms. To this end, we have defined the concept of 'learning regime' as the set of mechanisms that are triggers for and lead to the acquisition of new knowledge and skill s, allowing the head of the farm to improve his production and management methods. This concept has been tested in the cotton-growing basin of Bobo-Dioulasso in 30 farms considered innovative in five technical areas related to environmental sustainability. The results show that there are four different types of regimes (transformer-observer, reactive-networker, optimizer-self-reliant and imitator-dependent). These results call into question the assumption of homogeneity of farmers' capacities to change their routines to acquire new skills and know-how. However, give n that the nature of technical changes implemented is heavily influenced by the informational context in which the producer operates, supporting the learning of sustainability calls into question, in particular, the ability to empower farmers' vis-a-vis this context. While this work's contributions are currently mainly conceptual and methodological, it opens up new perspectives to improve processes and tools to support the emergence of a more sustainable agriculture .

Water and nutrient use efficiency and the vertical leaching losses in urban vegetable cropping systems in Bobo√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúDioulasso (Burkina Faso),"This thesis aimed at a comprehensive characterization of water and nutrient use and nutrient leaching losses in vegetable production systems in Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) in view of contributing to the development of more rational advice regarding water and nutrient management. For this purpose, three treatments were compared: farmer√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s normal fertilization practice (T100), a 30% reduction in fertilization rates (T70), and unfertilized plots (T0). Crop yield, irrigation water and fertilizers management practices as well as plant nutrient uptake were closely monitored. In addition, drainage was collected using zero√¢‚Ç¨‚Äútension pan lysimeters at 30 cm depth and analyzed for total N, P, and K content. Sites were equipped with weather stations and TDR probes. Furthermore, sites were also equipped with anion/cation exchange resin cartridges for monitoring the leaching of NO3, NH4, PO4, and K. Four vegetable crops were evaluated: tomato, cabbage, carrot and lettuce. As elsewhere in West Africa, vegetable production in Bobo Dioulasso is characterized by high fertilizer inputs. Indeed, 109 to 2,012 kg N, 66 to 450 kg P and 0 to 393 kg K were applied in excess of plant uptake in both gardens. Free drainage occurred mainly during rainy season, although some drainage occurred during the dry season at Kodeni. The high nutrient inputs combined with periods of high drainage resulted in sometimes high rates of NO3 and PO4 leaching, and on the other hand in strong positive nutrient balances in the soil of both sites. Large amounts of NO3 (236 to 990 kg ha√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú1 year√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú1) and to a lesser extend PO4 (28 to 75 kg ha√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú1 year√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú1) and K (54 to 214 kg K ha√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú1 year√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú1) were thus leached every year beyond the rooting depth. Using a simple fertilizer reduction strategy (T70) allowed to significantly increase the PFP of N, P and K by about 20 to 50% at Dogona and 20 to 45% at Kodeni. It also helped reduce both the amount of nutrients leached as well as the nutrients accumulated in the soil. The reduction in leaching losses ranged from 20 to 90% for NO3, 29 to 74% for PO4 and 14 to 39% for K. Given the sometimes excessive application rates for N and P in the two gardens studied here, reducing nutrient application rates by 30% may help reduce the environmental impact of vegetable cropping systems and lower the costs of investment in fertilizers without adverse effect on yields. Special attention should however be paid to maintaining the K balance.",2012,
Species delimitation and mitogenome phylogenetics in the subterranean genus Pseudoniphargus (Crustacea: Amphipoda).,"The amphi-Atlantic distributions exhibited by many thalassoid stygobiont (obligate subterranean) crustaceans have been explained by fragmentation by plate tectonics of ancestral shallow water marine populations. The amphipod stygobiont genus Pseudoniphargus is distributed across the Mediterranean region but also in the North Atlantic archipelagos of Bermuda, Azores, Madeira and the Canaries. We used species delimitation methods and mitogenome phylogenetic analyses to clarify the species diversity and evolutionary relationships within the genus and timing their diversification. Analyses included samples from the Iberian Peninsula, northern Morocco, the Balearic, Canarian, Azores and Madeira archipelagoes plus Bermuda. In most instances, morphological and molecular-based species delimitation analyses yielded consistent results. Notwithstanding, in a few cases either incipient speciation with no involvement of detectable morphological divergence or species crypticism were the most plausible explanations for the disagreement found between morphological and molecular species delimitations. Phylogenetic analyses based on a robust calibrated mitochondrial tree suggested that Pseudoniphargus lineages have a younger age than for other thalassoid amphipods displaying a disjunct distribution embracing both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. A major split within the family was estimated to occur at the Paleocene, when a lineage from Northern Iberian Peninsula diverged from the rest of pseudoniphargids. Species diversification in the peri-Mediterranean area was deduced to occur in early Miocene to Tortonian times, while in the Atlantic islands it started in the Pliocene. Our results show that the current distribution pattern of Pseudoniphargus resulted from a complex admix of relatively ancient vicariance events and several episodes of long- distance dispersal.",2018,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution
Theses and Dissertations 2010 Grouped variable selection in high dimensional partially linear additive Cox model,"In the analysis of survival outcome supplemented with both clinical information and high-dimensional gene expression data, traditional Cox proportional hazard model fails to meet some emerging needs in biological research. First, the number of covariates is generally much larger the sample size. Secondly, predicting an outcome with individual gene expressions is inadequate because a gene√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s expression is regulated by multiple biological processes and functional units. There is a need to understand the impact of changes at a higher level such as molecular function, cellular component, biological process, or pathway. The change at a higher level is usually measured with a set of gene expressions related to the biological process. That is, we need to model the outcome with gene sets as variable groups and the gene sets could be partially overlapped also. In this thesis work, we investigate the impact of a penalized Cox regression procedure on regularization, parameter estimation, variable group selection, and nonparametric modeling of nonlinear effects with a time-to-event outcome. We formulate the problem as a partially linear additive Cox model with high-dimensional data. We group genes into gene sets and approximate the nonparametric components by truncated series expansions with B-spline bases. After grouping and approximation, the problem of variable selection becomes that of selecting groups of coefficients in a gene set or in an approximation. We apply the group Lasso to obtain an initial solution path and reduce the dimension of",2016,

"Marinas as habitats for nearshore fish assemblages: comparative analysis of underwater visual census, baited cameras and fish traps","Understanding the ecological role that artificial structures might play on nearshore fish assemblages requires the collection of accurate and reliable data through efficient sampling techniques. In this work, differences in the composition and structure of fish assemblages between the inner and outer sides of three marinas located in the temperate northern-eastern Atlantic Ocean were tested using three complementary sampling techniques: underwater visual censuses (UVC), baited cameras (BCs) and fish traps (FTs). UVCs and BCs recorded a comparable number and relative abundance of species, which in turn were much greater than those recorded by FTs. This finding supports the use of UVCs and BCs over FTs for broad ecologically studies, especially when dealing with structurally complex habitats such as artificial structures. We found differences in fish assemblage structure between the inner and outer sides of marinas, independently of the sampling method. Four small-sized species ( Similiparma lurida, Thalassoma pavo, Sarpa salpa and Symphodus roissali ) associated with structurally complex vegetated habitats dominated, in terms of abundance, the outer sides of marinas; Diplodus vulgaris, Diplodus sargus and Gobius niger , species with high ecological plasticity in habitat requirements, dominated the inner sides of marinas. The information provided in this study is of great interest for developing sound monitoring programmes to ascertain the effects of artificial structures on fish communities.",2017,Scientia Marina
Random effects selection in generalized linear mixed models via shrinkage penalty function,"In this paper, we discuss the selection of random effects within the framework of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Based on a reparametrization of the covariance matrix of random effects in terms of modified Cholesky decomposition, we propose to add a shrinkage penalty term to the penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) function of the variance components for selecting effective random effects. The shrinkage penalty term is taken as a function of the variance of random effects, initiated by the fact that if the variance is zero then the corresponding variable is no longer random (with probability one). The proposed method takes the advantage of a convenient computation for the PQL estimation and appealing properties for certain shrinkage penalty functions such as LASSO and SCAD. We propose to use a backfitting algorithm to estimate the fixed effects and variance components in GLMMs, which also selects effective random effects simultaneously. Simulation studies show that the proposed approach performs quite well in selecting effective random effects in GLMMs. Real data analysis is made using the proposed approach, too.",2014,Statistics and Computing
High-dimensional statistical learning and nonparametric modeling,"High-dimensional data analysis has become increasingly frequent and important in various fields of sciences, engineering, and humanities, ranging from computational biology and health studies to financial engineering and risk management. This thesis addresses two important problems in high-dimensional data: estimation of network structure (precision matrix) among the variables and variable selection in ultrahigh additive models as well as the Cox√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s proportional hazards model. For network estimation in graphical models, we introduce non-concave penalties such as SCAD and the adaptive LASSO penalty to attenuate the bias problem. Simulation experiments and asymptotic theory are used to justify the proposed methods. In the second part, we extend the correlation learning proposed in Fan and Lv (2008) to marginal nonparametric learning in the ultrahigh sparse additive model as well as the Cox√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s proportional hazards model. The corresponding iterative versions are also provided to further reduce the false selection rate. Under the nonparametric additive models, it is shown that under some mild technical conditions, the proposed independence screening methods enjoy the sure screening property. The extent to which the dimensionality can be reduced by independence screening is also explicitly quantified. In addition, the thesis proposes a unified family of parametrically-guided nonparametric estimation schemes with theoretical justification and numerical demonstration. This combines the merits of both parametric and nonparametric approaches and enables us to incorporate prior knowledge.",2010,
Outcome regression methods in causal inference : The difference LASSO and selection of effect modifiers,"In causal inference, a central aim of covariate selection is to provide a subset of covariates, that is sufficient for confounding adjustment. One approach for this is to construct a subset of covariates associated with the outcome. This is sometimes referred to as the outcome approach, which is the subject for this thesis. Apart from confounding, there may exist effect modification. This occurs when a treatment has different effect on the outcome, among different subgroups, defined by effect modifiers. We describe how the outcome approach implemented by regression models, can be used for estimating the ATE, and how sufficient subsets of covariates may be constructed for these models. We also describe a novel method, called the difference LASSO, which results in identification of effect modifiers, rather than determination of sufficient subsets. The method is defined by an algorithm where, in the first step, an incorrectly specified model is fitted. We investigate the bias, arising from this misspecification, analytically and numerically for OLS. The difference LASSO is also compared with a regression estimator. The comparison is done in a simulation study, where the identification of effect modifiers is evaluated. This is done by analyzing the proportion of times a selection procedure results in a set of covariates including only the effect modifiers, or a set where the effect modifiers are included as a subset. The results show that the difference LASSO works relatively well for identification of effect modifiers. Among four designs, a set containing only the true effect modifiers were selected in at least 83.2%. The corresponding result for the regression estimator was 27.9%. However, the difference LASSO builds on biased estimation. Therefore, the method is not plausible for interpretation of treatment effects.

Popular science summary In causal inference we are interested in making causal statements about the effect of a treatment on some outcome. Consider an example where we study the effect of participation in a reading program on the reading ability among students. In this example, the treatment would be participation in the reading program, and the outcome could, for example, be a score on a given reading test. If the treatment is not randomly assigned there may be variables that affect the outcome or the treatment assignment, that is, the test score or if a student participates in the reading program or not. We call these variables covariates and an example of a covariate could be a student√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s health condition. There may be covariates that affect both the treatment assignment and the outcome. We call these covariates confounding covariates, and the confounding makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the true treatment effect. For example, if students who enjoy reading decide to participate in the reading program in greater extent, and they also score higher on the reading test, the effect of the reading program will be overestimated due to the confounding variable √¢‚Ç¨≈ìreading enjoyment√¢‚Ç¨¬ù. This bias can be removed if we, for instance, only compare test scores of students who enjoy reading. In order to make valid inference about the true treatment effect, we must have access to all confounding covariates, in our data. This is sometimes referred to as an assumption of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìno unmeasured confounding√¢‚Ç¨¬ù. In many situations we have access to a large number of covariates, where it is possible to find smaller sets of covariates, that imply no unmeasured confounding. In the example above, one approach for finding such a set of covariates could be to only include covariates that affect the test score, which is the approach we use in this thesis. The treatment may also have different effects on the outcome in subgroups, defined by some covariate(s). These covariates are called effect modifiers. Continuing the example above, suppose that students, whose parents are highly educated, are used to focus and therefore can benefit from the reading program in greater extent than other students. In this case the parents education is an effect modifier, and it may be of interest to identify these kind of covariates. In this thesis we describe standard regression methods for estimating the effect of a treatment on an outcome. We also describe how, as a part of these methods, a set of covariates that imply no unmeasured confounding, is chosen. Additionally, we describe a method, called the difference LASSO. Instead of finding confounding covariates, this method identifies effect modifiers. The method is defined by a procedure which causes systematic errors (bias), and we investigate these errors as well. Furthermore, a comparison, between the difference LASSO and one of the standard methods, is made in a simulation study. The comparison is based on the number of times each method found the true effect modifiers, under different scenarios. From this we have learned that the difference LASSO works relatively well for finding effect modifiers, for instance, the method resulted in that the true effect modifiers were found in at least 83.2%. This can be compared to 27.9%, which is the corresponding result for the standard method. However, the difference LASSO is based on a procedure which causes bias. This suggests that the method only should be used for identification of effect modifiers, and not for interpretation of treatment effects.",2018,

The spermatozoa and the sperm aggregates of 13 species belonging to four genera (Smithsonidrilus, Limnodriloides, Thalassodrilides, Doliodrilus) in the tubificid subfamily Limnodriloidinae (Annelida, Oligochaeta) were studied and compared with the spermatozoal patterns already described in the subfamily Tubificinae. Two characters considered exclusive for the Tubificinae were found in the more spermatologically variable Limnodriloidinae: the production of two kinds of spermatozoa, eusperm and parasperm, and the presence, in the spermathecae, of sperm aggregates formed by a combination of the two sperm types. A parsimony analysis was performed on the spermatozoal data of the species examined and compared with that based on the somatic characters of the same species: a critical revision of the already codified eusperm characters was carried out and the ultrastructure of parasperm was used as a new subset of spermatozoal characters. In a total evidence approach, a further parsimony analysis was run using a matrix combining both sets of characters. This analysis suggested that the double sperm line and the sperm aggregates composed of both eusperm and parasperm may well be homologous in tubificines and limnodriloidines. It thus supported the previous notion that Tubificinae and Limnodriloidinae are closely related and indicated that these subfamilies may be sister taxa.",2003,Zoologica Scripta

Dissecting Characteristics Non-Parametrically√¢ÀÜ‚Äî,"Academic research has identified more than 300 characteristics associated with cross-sectional return premia. We propose a novel, non-parametric methodolody to test which characteristics provide independent information for the cross section of expected returns. We use the adaptive group LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) to select characteristics and estimate splines over intervals of the characteristic distribution. The proposed method overcomes issues traditional methods face and is robust to outliers. Many of the previously identified return predictors do not provide incremental information for expected returns and non-linearities are important. Our proposed methodology has higher out-of-sample explanatory power compared to linear panel regressions and increases Sharpe ratios by 70%.",2016,
Low Rank and Structured Modeling of High-Dimensional Vector Autoregressions,"Network modeling of high-dimensional time series data is a key learning task due to its widespread use in a number of application areas, including macroeconomics, finance, and neuroscience. While the problem of sparse modeling based on vector autoregressive models (VAR) has been investigated in depth in the literature, more complex network structures that involve low rank and group sparse components have received considerably less attention, despite their presence in data. Failure to account for low-rank structures results in spurious connectivity among the observed time series, which may lead practitioners to draw incorrect conclusions about pertinent scientific or policy questions. In order to accurately estimate a network of Granger causal interactions after accounting for latent effects, we introduce a novel approach for estimating low-rank and structured sparse high-dimensional VAR models. We introduce a regularized framework involving a combination of nuclear norm and lasso (or group lasso) penalties. Subsequently, we establish nonasymptotic probabilistic upper bounds on the estimation error rates of the low-rank and the structured sparse components. We also introduce a fast estimation algorithm and finally demonstrate the performance of the proposed modeling framework over standard sparse VAR estimates through numerical experiments on synthetic and real data.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Dynamic prediction of long-term survival in patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a SEER population-based study,"BackgroundThis study investigated a large number of patients to develop a predictive nomogram for survival and a web-based survival rate calculator that can dynamically predict the long-term survival of patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.MethodsA total of 2647 patients diagnosed with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from 1998 to 2014 were extracted from the SEER database. We used the Lasso Cox regression model to identify independent risk factors for long-term survival and to develop a predictive nomogram for survival and a web-based survival rate calculator.ResultsThe median (mean) follow-up time was 30√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞months (52.8√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞months). Cancer-specific survival rates decreased with time, while the 5-year conditional survival increased with time. Cancer-specific deaths were not constant. Cancer-specific deaths of patients within the first 2√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞years were high, while the risk remained relatively constant after 2√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞years. The independent risk factors included surgery, chemotherapy, tumor stage and age, according to the Lasso Cox regression analysis. We developed a predictive nomogram and a web-based survival rate calculator (https://linjuli1991.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/). The calibration plot suggested that the actual value exhibited good agreement with the predicted value.ConclusionsWe found that patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma had a high risk of death during the first 2√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞years. Additional active follow-up strategies should be provided during this period. This is the first study to develop a predictive nomogram and a web-based survival rate calculator that can provide evidence for individual treatment and follow-up.",2019,BMC Cancer

In this chapter, we discuss the difference between confirmatory and predictive analyses and explain the tradeoff between bias and precision in statistical models. We present commonly used methods to rank models according to their predictive performance, such as cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC). We also introduce the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and ridge regression as flexible tools to shrink model coefficients toward zero. Finally, we present how to do model averaging based on posterior model probabilities. Throughout the chapter, we emphasize the importance of prior knowledge and scientific reasoning when building models or combining information from different models.",2015,
Methods and Metrics for Knowledge Base Engineering and Integration,"Today a wealth of knowledge and data are distributed using Semantic Web standards. Especially in the (bio)medical domain several sources like the SNOMED CT, NCI, MedDRA, MeSH, ICD-10 ontologies, and many more are distributed in RDF and OWL. These can be aligned and integrated in order to create one large medical Knowledge Base. However, integrating different and largely heterogeneous sources is far from trivial. First, although distributed in OWL many of the ontologies may not strictly follow the semantics of subClassOf as originally intended for faceted search or use as thesauri. Second, even when they do follow strict ontological guidelines, different ontologies may conceptualise the same domain in radically different ways. Analysing and understanding these sources before integrating them is highly beneficial. Third, monitoring and understanding how the structure of the Knowledge Base changes (evolves) after the integration is also crucial since changes to its structure may affect applications that are built on top of it. In the current paper we report on our Knowledge Base construction pipeline which is based on ontology integration. We focus on the various metrics, techniques, and tools we have developed in order to assist in achieving this large-scale integration task. Our work was motivated by the need for a medical Knowledge Base to be used to support digital healthcare services developed at Babylon Health. We present results on the metrics used to analyse various sources and the results of running the pipeline on several medical ontologies.",2018,
Model Selection for Vector Autoregressive Processes via Adaptive Lasso,"Determination of the best subset is an important step in vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling. Traditional methods either conduct subset selection and parameter estimation separately or compute expensively. In this article, we propose a VAR model selection procedure using adaptive Lasso, for it is computational efficient and can select subset and estimate parameters simultaneously. By proper choice of tuning parameters, we can choose the correct subset and obtain the asymptotic normality of the non zero parameters. Simulation studies and real data analysis show that adaptive Lasso performs better than existing methods in VAR model fitting and prediction.",2013,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods

On Sparse Vector Recovery Performance in Structurally Orthogonal Matrices via LASSO,"In this paper, we consider the compressed sensing problem of reconstructing a sparse signal from an undersampled set of noisy linear measurements. The regularized least squares or least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) formulation is used for signal estimation. The measurement matrix is assumed to be constructed by concatenating several randomly orthogonal bases, which we refer to as structurally orthogonal matrices. Such measurement matrix is highly relevant to large-scale compressive sensing applications because it facilitates rapid computation and parallel processing. Using the replica method in statistical physics, we derive the mean-squared-error (MSE) formula of reconstruction over the structurally orthogonal matrix in the large-system regime. Extensive numerical experiments are provided to verify the analytical result. We then consider the analytical result to investigate the MSE behaviors of the LASSO over the structurally orthogonal matrix, with an emphasis on performance comparisons with matrices with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian entries. We find that structurally orthogonal matrices are at least as good as their i.i.d. Gaussian counterparts. Thus, the use of structurally orthogonal matrices is attractive in practical applications.",2016,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing

A total of 990 E. coli isolates from 100 patients and 50 controls was tested for enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) serotype (O:H), adherence to HEp-2 cells after incubation for 3 and 6 h, fluorescent actin staining (FAS), DNA hybridisation with EAF, eaeA, STh, STp and EAggEC probes and production of heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and verocytotoxin (VT) with Y1 and Vero cells. EPEC were the most prevalent enteropathogens in patients (32.7%; and 14% in controls). Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and Vero cytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) were not detected. The rate of isolation of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) was identical in both groups. Among the EPEC isolates the prevalent serotypes were Olll:H2, 055:NM and 01 19:H6. Localised adherence (LA) was found significantly more frequently in isolates from patients (19.6%) than controls (2.1%). All LA-positive EPEC isolates were FASf and eaeAf, but only 75.2% of them hybridised with the EAF probe. Diffusely adhering E. coli (DAEC) and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAggEC) were found with equal frequency in patients and controls. Twenty-seven E. coli isolates were negative for EAF but positive for eaeA and FAS and produced LA in 6-h adherence tests. These EAF-/eaeA+ strains were the only putative enteropathogen identified in seven patients and were not found in controls. The ability of these strains to elicit ultrastructural cell alterations and cell-signalling events was evaluated in Caco-2 cells (human colon carcinoma cell line) by the gentamicin invasion assay and by transmission electron microscopy. The numbers of intracellular bacteria in cell invasion tests varied from 0.4% to 1.6% of the cellassociated bacteria after a 6-h incubation period. Tyrosine phosphorylation of host cell proteins was assessed in HEp-2 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy and all strains gave positive results. EAF-/eaeA+ E. coli strains express most of the virulence properties found among true EPEC strains and can be a relevant cause of infant diarrhoea in developing countries.",1998,
Contemporary Arab Women Writers: Cultural Expression in Context,"Anastasia Valassopoulos. Contemporary Arab Women Writers: Cultural Expression in Context London: Roucledge, 2007. Pp. 176. [pounds sterling]60.00 hardcover. Anastasia Valassopoulos's book covers a wide range of Arab women's literature and advocates a critical engagement with Arab women's writing that goes beyond tried and tested feminist paradigms. Valassopoulos discusses novels from Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria and Palestine but emphasizes that her choices were nor ""guided by location but by issues of theme and form"" (2). Enabled by the ""growing field of translation and distribution of Arab women's literature"" (1), Valassopoulos considers it necessary to broaden the disciplinary forum of discussion of these works. Thus her ambitious and insightful book has a clear agenda: it seeks to promote the study of Arab women's writing as an integral part of postcolonial and feminist studies. This book is directed at an English speaking audience. Valassopoulos goes to great lengths to justify the use of translated material; besides being concerned with raising the visibility of these novels, she feels the need to discuss material which is available to a wide readership: ""I did not want to engage with material on which I would have the last word. I write in the spirit of transcultural and transnational communication, and if a work has been translated and is readily available, then I invite a community of readers to participate openly in its interpretation"" (2). Throughout the book, Valassopoulos emphasizes the need to contextualize Arab women's writing and cautions against employing critical approaches that may stifle rather than open up new possibilities for reading these texts. A commonly held critical assumption, which Valassopoulos finds problematic, is, for example, that ""Arab women's writing only has one thing to offer: an affirmation of oppression. Read critically, many of the works that I discuss reveal a deep-seated mistrust of any foreclosing arguments that would seek to predetermine their meaning"" (4). Valassopoulos also avoids focusing on ""questions of faith and ethnicity"" as these issues threaten to ""dominate the discussion on Arab women's literary production"" (2). Instead, she argues for employing a variety of critical approaches such as ""feminist, queer, postcolonial and cultural theories."" Not only will those approaches benefit the study of Arab women's literature, a critical engagement with their writing can in turn enrich and productively ""inform contemporary literary criticism and theory"" (3). The first chapter outlines the critical reception and study of Arab women's literature. Not only is this chapter very well-informed and useful for those outside the field of Arab literature and criticism, but it also lays down clearly and concisely the methodological framework of this book and clarities the author's stance on key concepts such as Arab feminism and her championing of an inclusive and mutually informed employment of feminist and postcolonial theoretical concepts. The following chapters expand on these programmatic statements but are by no means confined to proving their validity. In fact, every chapter has a very distinct focus and agenda, both in terms of thematic treatment and methodology. Valassopoulos dedicates one chapter to the discussion of the early novels of Nawal El Saadawi, Woman at Point Zero, Memoirs of a Woman Doctor, and Two Women in One. Valassopoulos produces sensitive and meticulous close readings of the novels in dialogue with feminist and postcolonial theory, and persistently probes and interrogates the relations between the literary, theoretical and contextual and offers complex and bold conclusions: ""I am not certain that it is possible to speak of a postcolonial feminism without referring to El Saadawi's polemics and her early fiction. √¢‚Ç¨¬¶",2009,

Ensemble Method for Censored Demand Prediction,"Many economic applications, including optimal pricing and inventory management, require predictions of demand based on sales data and the estimation of the reaction of sales to price change. There is a wide range of econometric approaches used to correct biases in the estimates of demand parameters on censored sales data. These approaches can also be applied to various classes of machine learning (ML) models to reduce the prediction error of sales volumes. In this study we construct two ensemble models for demand prediction with and without accounting for demand censorship. Accounting for sales censorship is based on a censored quantile regression where the model estimation was split into two separate parts: a) a prediction of zero sales by the classification model; and b) a prediction of non-zero sales by the regression model. Models with and without censorship are based on the prediction aggregations of least squares, Ridge and Lasso regressions and the Random Forest model. Having estimated the predictive properties of both models, we empirically test the best predictive power of the model taking into account the censored nature of demand. We also show that ML with censorship provides bias corrected estimates of demand sensitivity to price change similar to econometric models",2018,ArXiv

Coordinates of Developing the Balneary Tourism,"Health is not only the absence of the disease or infirmity, but a state of wellbeing as physical, mental and social. In this context, the acquisition and maintaining of physical and mental health is regarded as ""a component of the quality of life"". Modern people, overwhelmed by professional and personal problems√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ solving, often neglect their own health, but for all of that there is a viable alternative, namely health tourism or balneary tourism. Balneary segment belongs to the health tourism market, together with medical tourism, thalassotherapy, hydrotherapy, wellbeing/ spa and fitness. Balneary tourism is one of the forms with constant tourist traffic having a relatively stable clientele, and that contributes to increasing of the utilization coefficients of accommodation√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s capacity and to achieve greater average revenues per day / tourist. Given the need to adapt the balneary resorts to the requirements of the tourists, this paper aims to highlight some aspects regarding the content and quiddity of the balneary tourism, but also about adopting the repositioning policies of balneary resorts and prospects for development of balneary tourism in Romania/ Valcea County.",2016,Management Strategies Journal

SAMIR: Sparsity Amplified Iteratively-reweighted Beamforming for High-rsolution Ultrasound Imaging,"In ultrasound imaging, one typically employs delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformers for image reconstruction. An apodization window is used to suppress the side-lobes of an array beam pattern. The application of an apodization window to suppress the side-lobes widens the main-lobe width. We consider a statistical beamformer and present two variants. The signal of interest is modeled as a Laplacian-distributed random variable and additive interference components as Gaussian distributed. The resultant LASSO formulation is known to suffer from underestimation of large signal amplitudes due to the ${\ell _1}$-norm regularization. In the first variant, we reformulate the LASSO problem with a minimax-concave penalty (called Sparsity AMplified (SAM)) to contain the bias, thereby enhancing the beamformed image. A closed-form pointwise estimator is obtained for the optimization problem. In the second variant, we propose Sparsity A Mplified Iteratively-Reweighted (SAMIR) beamforming algorithm, which leverages the properties of an apodization function. In SAMIR beamforming, we jointly optimize the cost over the signal of interest and the exmnsic apodization weights. This beamformer results in high-resolution ultrasound images, especially in the lateral direction. The proposed methods are compared with the standard DAS and a recently proposed statistically-modeled beamformer, iMAP, for a different number of plane-wave insonifications.",2019,"ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Function of Stored Sugar Beets Size on Sodium and Potassium Changes in Silo,"On of the most important of sugar beets quality is amount of sodium and potassium, because this compounds are strongly molassogenic and reduction of yield. So , attention on reasons that change this compound in sugar beets and consequently in produced juice are very important. In this study, effect of size of sugar beet (obtained from different areas) on changes of sodium and potassium are investigated. Sugar beets that obtained from 3 areas , are sorted ( big size, medium size, small size and mixed size) and stored during 18 days industrial silo in Shirvan sugar factory. The results shown that amount of sodium and potassium related to cultivation areas and during storage amount of this compound change with size of sugar beets inversely.

Properties and Refinements of The Fused Lasso,"We consider estimating an unknown signal, both blocky and sparse, which is corrupted by additive noise. We study three interrelated least squares procedures and their asymptotic properties. The first procedure is the fused lasso, put forward by Friedman et al. [Ann. Appl. Statist. 1 (2007) 302-332], which we modify into a different estimator, called the fused adaptive lasso, with better properties. The other two estimators we discuss solve least squares problems on sieves; one constrains the maximal l 1 norm and the maximal total variation seminorm, and the other restricts the number of blocks and the number of nonzero coordinates of the signal. We derive conditions for the recovery of the true block partition and the true sparsity patterns by the fused lasso and the fused adaptive lasso, and we derive convergence rates for the sieve estimators, explicitly in terms of the constraining parameters.",2009,Annals of Statistics
On the detection and prevention of consistency anomalies in multi-tier and cloud platforms,"Modern information systems, consisting of an application server tier and a database tier, offer several consistency guarantees for accessing data where strong consistency is traded for better performance or higher availability. However, it is often not clear how an application is affected when it runs under a low level of consistency. In fact, current application designers have basically no tools that would help them to get a feeling of which and how many inconsistencies actually occur during run-time of their particular application. In this thesis, we present new approaches to detect and quantify consistency anomalies for arbitrary multi-tier or cloud applications accessing various types of data stores in transactional or non-transactional contexts. We do not require any knowledge on the business logic of the studied application nor on its selected consistency guarantees. Our detection approaches can be off-line or on-line and for each detected anomaly, we identify exactly the requests and data items involved. Furthermore, we classify the detected anomalies into patterns showing the business methods involved as well as their occurrence frequency. Our approaches can help designers to either choose consistency guarantees where the anomalies do not occur or to change the application design to avoid the anomalies. Furthermore, we provide an option in which future anomalies are dynamically prevented should a certain threshold of anomalies occur. To test the effectiveness of our approaches, we have conducted a set of experiments analyzing the occurrence of anomalies in the benchmarks RUBiS and SPECj Enterprise 2010 under the multi-tier platform JavaEE and the benchmarks JMeter andYahoo! YCSB under the cloud platforms Google App Engine and Cassandra, respectively.%%%%Les systemes d'information modernes, consistant d'un niveau de serveur d'applications et d'un niveau de base de donnees, offrent plusieurs guaranties de consistance pour acceder a des donnees ou la consistance est compromise pour une meilleure performance ou pour une haute disponibilite.

c-LASSO and its dual for sparse signal estimation from array data,"We treat the estimation of a sparse set of sources emitting plane waves observed by a sensor array as a complex-valued LASSO (c-LASSO) problem where the usual √Ö¬∫1-norm constraint is replaced by the √Ö¬∫1-norm of a matrix D times the solution vector. When the sparsity order is given, algorithmically selecting a suitable value for the c-LASSO regularization parameter remains a challenging task. The corresponding dual problem is formulated and it is shown that the dual solution is useful for selecting the regularization parameter of the c-LASSO. The solution path of the c-LASSO is analyzed and this motivates an order-recursive algorithm for the selection of the regularization parameter and a faster iterative algorithm that is based on a further approximation. This greatly facilitates computation of the c-LASSO-path as we can predict the changes in the active indices as the regularization parameter is reduced. Using this regularization parameter, the directions of arrival for all sources are estimated. HighlightsThe dual problem to the complex-valued c-LASSO is formulated and analyzed.The dual solution is the output of a weighted matched filter of c-LASSO residuals.The dual solution motivates a selection of the c-LASSO regularization parameter.This gives an order-recursive scheme for selecting the regularization parameter.Approximations lead to the formulation of faster iterative algorithms for its solution.",2017,Signal Process.
Hard modeling Multivariate Curve Resolution using LASSO: Application to Ion,"abstract Article history:Received 21 May 2010Received in revised form 13 September 2010Accepted 20 September 2010Available online 7 October 2010Keywords:Blind Source SeparationIon Mobility SpectrometryMultivariate Curve ResolutionSparse solutionNon-Negative Matrix Factorization Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) aims to blindly recover the concentration pro√Ø¬¨¬Åle and the sourcespectra without any prior supervised calibration step. It is well known that imposing additional constraintslike positiveness, closure and others may improve the quality of the solution. When a physico-chemicalmodel of the process is known, this can be also introduced constraining even more the solution. In thispaper, we apply MCR to Ion Mobility Spectra. Since instrumental models suggest that peaksare of Gaussianshape with a width depending on the instrument resolution, we introduce that each source ischaracterized by a linear superposition of Gaussian peaks of√Ø¬¨¬Åxed spread. We also prove that this modelis able to√Ø¬¨¬Åt wider peaks departing from pure Gaussian shape. Instead of introducing a non-linear Gaussianpeak √Ø¬¨¬Åtting, we use a very dense model and rely on a least square solver with L1-norm regularization toobtain a sparse solution. This is accomplished via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator(LASSO).

Evolution of Sex-Ratio in Structured Population Dynamics,"In this Thesis we address the study of some non-linear evolution equations (e.g. pde's) modelling the dynamics of sexually-reproducing structured populations, with special emphasis on biological evolution driven by natural selection. The latter is incorporated into the models through the adaptive dynamics, which is a way of describing how the hereditary characteristics of the population evolve. The sex-ratio, defined as the proportion between females and males, is analyzed from the evolutionary point of view. The memoir is divided into two parts plus a brief introduction to age-structured population dynamics (Chapter 1). The first part (Chapter 2) is devoted to a model for the dynamics of a sequential hermaphrodite species, i.e. a population where every individual functions early in life as one sex (specfically as a female) and then switches to the other sex for the rest of its life, and the sex-reversal occurs at a specific age which is considered as a non-negative random variable. This phenomenon happens in a variety of animals including fish species like the sea bream (""Sparus aurata""), the anemone fish, the parrot fish and the blue-headed wrasse (""Thalassoma bifasciatum""). First of all we introduce the basic hypotheses and the parameters of the model: the probability law of the age at sex-reversal, the non-linear (due to the sexual reproduction) birth function giving the influx of newborns, and the density-dependent per capita mortality rate. The complete system (which displays the birth, transition and death processes) for the age-densities of females and males, is formulated and derived in the form of non-linear integral equations as well as the smooth version in the form of nonlocal non-linear first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations (partial integro-differential equations) with boundary, at age zero, and initial conditions. We take the former approach because of the lack of regularity in general, and in the latter, the derivative of the probability law appears in the transition term from female to male. In Section 2.3 we show the existence and uniqueness of global solutions which are non-negative and biologically meaningful for the present model. We introduce additional hypotheses, namely, suitable Lipschitz conditions on the birth function and the mortality rate. In Section 2.4 we show that the system can be reduced to the intrinsic sex-ratio subspace where the dynamics is given by a single non-linear integral equation for the age-density of individuals of both sexes. An explicit form of the birth function, in terms of the fertility rates, is derived for latter numerical purposes. It corresponds to a Holling type II functional response, and it is based on the fact that females arrange its time in looking for mates and handling the production of new offspring. The expected searching time is proportional to 1-(number of males), whereas the expected handling time is a constant. Section 2.5 studies the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions as time tends to infinity. We have determined a sufficient condition for having bounded trajectories and the possibility of non-trivial dynamics. On the other hand we have seen that the extinction equilibrium is always locally asymptotically stable, displaying the Allee effect, which is a common feature of sexually reproducing populations. In Section 2.6 we address the stationary problem, i.e. we look for solutions independent of time in L1 +. The non-trivial steady states are determined according to a scalar non-linear equation for the total population at equilibrium as an independent variable. We end the section by illustrating two cases. The first one is the (non-linear) case of neglecting the competition for the resources, obtaining that there is at most a non-trivial steady state which is always unstable. An explicit expression of this equilibrium is given, and the instability is obtained by means of a linearization procedure. The second case, which is rather general, includes some sort of competition and we have found two non-trivial equilibria for each value of the expected age at sex-reversal in a bounded open interval. Both cases are depicted in a bifurcation diagram, for two choices of the probability law (Heaviside/exponential). The theory of accretive operators, i.e. those such that its resolvent operator is a non-expansive map, is needed in order to study the local stability of equilibria for the general case. A proof of the principle of linearized stability for the reduced system is given in Appendix A, and it is based on a principle for non-linear evolution equations governed by accretive operators, where the stability is determined by the accretiveness of an associated linear operator. In Section 2.7 we rewrite the reduced system as an evolution equation and introduce additional hypotheses, mainly, suitable conditions on the regularity of the birth function and the mortality rate. Finally we get a sufficient condition for the local stability without computing the spectrum of the linear part. Considering phenotypic evolution in the context of diploid population models, in Section 2.8 we study the evolutionary dynamics of the age at sex-reversal. The function-valued trait considered is the probability law. We assume a resident population at stable equilibrium and consider a small invading/mutant population make up of heterozygotes, and homozygotes (negligible). We have used convex analysis in order to show that an unbeatable strategy or evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is a Heaviside step function: all individuals of the population change sex at the same age. More precisely, the computation of such an (infinite dimensional) strategy is based on linear/affine optimization on compact convex sets. Our result is a generalization of the one obtained by Charnov. Finally, Section 2.9 is devoted to the adaptive value of the sex-ratio of the population at equilibrium, which is in general different from one. However, if the fertilities are age independent then the sex-ratio equals to one. In addition, assuming also an age independent mortality we have that the transition from female to male takes place at 69,3% of the life expectancy of the population. The second part (Chapter 3) is devoted to a model for the sexual phase of a haplodiploid species (monogonont rotifers) which exhibits the so-called cyclic parthenogenesis (both forms of reproduction: non-sexual and sexual). Monogonont rotifers are small micro-invertebrate animals who inhabit aquatic media with seasonal variations. The original system, which was introduced by Aparici, Carmona and Serra from the department of ecology at the Universitat de Valencia, is formulated in the form of nonlocal non-linear first order hyperbolic partial differential equations. The state variables are the age-densities of virgin mictic females (male-producing), mated mictic females (resting egg-producing), and haploid males, whereas the time-independent parameters of the model are the per capita mortality rates, the male-female encounter rate, the recruitment rate of mictic females, the fertility of male-producing mictic females, the age at maturity for females, and the threshold age of fertilization (which is less than or equal to the maturation age). The transition from virgin to mated is given in terms of the characteristic function of the fertilization period and the total population of haploid males. The equation for mated females turns out to be uncoupled from the others, so we focus on the other ones. Scaling the units in age, time and population we have reduced the number of parameters to only four: the new mortality rates, the new threshold age of fertilization, and the new encounter rate. As a result, we obtain the reduced and nondimensionalized system. Section 3.3 addresses the stationary problem, i.e. we look for time-independent solutions in W 1;1. We have found that there is a unique continuous steady state which can be written in terms of the total male population at equilibrium. The latter is obtained as the unique solution of a scalar non-linear equation. Section 3.4 studies the local stability of the equilibrium by means of a linearization procedure. On the one hand, we analyze the characteristic equation obtaining complex solutions that cross the imaginary axis, and on the other hand we prove a principle of linearized stability which is based on a semilinear formulation in L1, and the fact that the essential growth bound is negative (as usual in this kind of equations). The linear stability analysis reveals that the equilibrium is stable for values of the parameters in a large region containing the empirical ones. However, it can be unstable for values not too far. In Section 3.5 we apply a Hopf bifurcation theorem in an infinite dimensional setting. We check that there is a pair of conjugate eigenvalues on the imaginary axis which cross with positive speed. Rewriting the system as a non-linear evolution equation and computing both the adjoint and the resolvent operators (the latter solving a linear ode with piecewise constant coeffcients), we can determine if the bifurcation is subcritical or supercritical. As a result, we have shown the appearance of a stable limit cycle (isolated periodic orbit). Section 3.6 is devoted to the numerical solution of the problem. We have designed an explicit numerical scheme based on both analytical and numerical integration along the characteristic curves. Several numerical experiments are presented. The numerical simulations confirm and extend the analytical results obtained.",2005,

Where standardissue histories of philosophy often frame the Berlin period as a gigantomachia between the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìconservative√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Schelling and the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìradical√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Hegel, this narrative neglects Schelling√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s prior reputation as an antior nonestablishment thinker.

Regularization parameter selection for a bayesian group sparse multi-task regression model with application to imaging genomics,"We investigate the choice of tuning parameters for a Bayesian multi-level group lasso model developed for the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetic data. The regression model we consider relates multivariate phenotypes consisting of brain summary measures (volumetric and cortical thickness values) to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) data and imposes penalization at two nested levels, the first corresponding to genes and the second corresponding to SNPs. Associated with each level in the penalty is a tuning parameter which corresponds to a hyperparameter in the hierarchical Bayesian formulation. Following previous work on Bayesian lassos we consider the estimation of tuning parameters through either hierarchical Bayes based on hyperpriors and Gibbs sampling or through empirical Bayes based on maximizing the marginal likelihood using a Monte Carlo EM algorithm. For the specific model under consideration we find that these approaches can lead to severe overshrinkage of the regression parameter estimates in the highdimensional setting or when the genetic effects are weak. We demonstrate these problems through simulation examples and study an approximation to the marginal likelihood which sheds light on the cause of this problem. We then suggest an alternative approach based on the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC), an asymptotic approximation to leave-one-out crossvalidation that can be computed conveniently within an MCMC framework.",2016,2016 International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Neuroimaging (PRNI)

Active Learning for Recommender Systems with Multiple Localized Models,"For effective predictive modeling in large scale recommender systems, it is essential to have many customers rate a large number of products, i.e., obtain a large number of labeled data. However, most consumers often do not provide their preferences without proper incentives. Given a budget to reward consumers for their feedback, it would be beneficial to have a policy to suggest the ratings of which customers and for what products would be most cost-effective to acquire, so as to improve modeling the most. E-commerce businesses can use such a policy to cost-effectively acquire consumers√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ ratings or other forms of feedbacks, incrementally. This challenge can be mapped to the problem of active learning [2] in which a learner aims to intelligently select the labels of particularly informative examples from a pool of prospective acquisitions, so as to improve generalization accuracy the most for a given number of acquisitions. While there are published results for active learning in a regression setting [4, 5], there has been little study of approaches that are applicable to important, practical scenarios. In particular, most proposed approaches aim at optimizing the training input density (non pool based) rather than evaluate prospective acquisitions from an available pool, and focus on linear least squares models. In addition, most of the literature on active learning, especially in the machine learning community involves learning in the context of classification problems [2]. Also, these methods consider predictions obtained by either a single √¢‚Ç¨≈ìglobal√¢‚Ç¨¬ù probabilistic classification model or an ensemble of global classifiers (e.g., bagging or boosting). As we discuss below, large scale data sets that are characteristic of recommender systems, suggest other types of modeling that are significantly more appropriate. The data encountered in large scale recommender systems typically exhibit inherent heterogeneity among the customers and products. For instance, Amazon.com being a large retailer has customers who exhibit varied purchase patterns. As we demonstrate, in this setting it is beneficial to model the behavior of different groups of customers separately. Similarly, because the retailer√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s products span a very wide range of categories, it is also advantageous to model ratings for homogeneous product groups separately. Thus, rather than induce a single predictive model, one can represent such data by a set of multiple local models, such that each local model captures consumers√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ ratings in a certain region of the input (consumer/product) space. We propose a radically different active learning scheme that (a) leverages a collection of localized predictive models, and (b) generalizes to both classification and regression prediction problems. Our approach is also applicable to a wide range of model types, including non linear models such as MLPs, or regularized linear models (ridge/lasso). Before developing our active learning strategy, we first discuss briefly how to learn a set of local predictive models to accurately represent such heterogeneous data. We recently proposed Simultaneous CO-clustering And Learning (SCOAL) [3], a versatile and effective framework for predictive modeling of large scale, heterogeneous, dyadic data. SCOAL interleaves simultaneous partitioning along both √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcustomer√¢‚Ç¨¬ù and √¢‚Ç¨≈ìproduct√¢‚Ç¨¬ù modes (co-clustering) and the construction of prediction models to iteratively improve both the assignment of a consumer√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s rating to a given cluster, as well as improve the fit of the model induced within each data cluster. SCOAL exploits both neighborhood information and the available customer/product attributes, thereby combining the benefits of collaborative filtering and of content based approaches. The framework can be viewed as simultaneous co-segmentation and classification (or regression), and we show is substantially better than independently clustering the data a priori followed by model induction. In SCOAL, each model",2009,
A Problem in Model Selection of LASSO and Introduction of Scaling,"In this article, we considered to assign a single scaling parameter to LASSO estimators for investigating and improving a problem of excessive shrinkage at a sparse representation. This problem is important because it directly affects a quality of model selection in LASSO. We derived a prediction risk for LASSO with scaling and obtained an optimal scaling parameter value that minimizes the risk. We then showed the risk is improved by assigning the optimal scaling value. In a numerical example, we found that an estimate of the optimal scaling value is larger than one especially at a sparse representation; i.e. excessive shrinkage is relaxed by expansion via scaling. Additionally, we observed that a risk for LASSO is high at a sparse representation and it is minimized at a relatively large model while this is improved by the introduction of an estimate of the optimal scaling value. We here constructed a fully empirical risk estimate that approximates the actual risk well. We then observed that, by applying the risk estimate as a model selection criterion, LASSO with scaling tends to obtain a model with low risk and high sparsity compared to LASSO without scaling.",2016,
Human vs. Automated Text Analysis: Estimating Positive and Negative Affect,"Automated text analysis (ATA) has been a widely used tool for determining the sentiment of writing samples. However, it is unclear how ATA compares to human ratings of text when estimating affect. There are costs and benefits associated with each method, and comparing the two approaches will help determine which one provides the most useful and accurate results. This study uses 279 journal entries from individuals with chronic pain in order to estimate the positive and negative affect scores reported directly by participants. We use Lasso to select the features that are most predictive of affect. Our results indicate that the model combining human coders and ATA accounts for the most variance in self-reported positive affect scores, resulting in adjusted R-squared=0.36. For negative affect scores, we obtain a lower adjusted R-squared=0.30 with the combined model, however, ATA results in significantly higher adjusted R-squared=0.27 compared to the model using only human coders, R-squared=0.14. This suggests that utilizing human coders may be the most beneficial when the focus is on positive affect, but automated text analysis may be sufficient when studying negative affect.",2016,
Improving the prediction of going concern of Taiwanese listed companies using a hybrid of LASSO with data mining techniques,"The purpose of this study is to establish rigorous and reliable going concern doubt (GCD) prediction models. This study first uses the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to select variables and then applies data mining techniques to establish prediction models, such as neural network (NN), classification and regression tree (CART), and support vector machine (SVM). The samples of this study include 48 GCD listed companies and 124 NGCD (non-GCD) listed companies from 2002 to 2013 in the TEJ database. We conduct fivefold cross validation in order to identify the prediction accuracy. According to the empirical results, the prediction accuracy of the LASSO√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúNN model is 88.96√Ç¬†% (Type I error rate is 12.22√Ç¬†%; Type II error rate is 7.50√Ç¬†%), the prediction accuracy of the LASSO√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúCART model is 88.75√Ç¬†% (Type I error rate is 13.61√Ç¬†%; Type II error rate is 14.17√Ç¬†%), and the prediction accuracy of the LASSO√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúSVM model is 89.79√Ç¬†% (Type I error rate is 10.00√Ç¬†%; Type II error rate is 15.83√Ç¬†%).",2016,SpringerPlus
Hemodynamically significant atrial septal defect after atrial fibrillation ablation: A hole to remember.,"Case Report A 67-year-old woman was referred for cryoablation after flecainide therapy for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) was unsuccessful. A transesophageal echocardiogram performed immediately before the ablation was unremarkable. Double-transseptal puncture with a Brockenbrough needle through 8F SL0 and SL2 sheaths was performed. A Lasso catheter was advanced through the SL2 sheath into the left atrium and used to map all 4 pulmonary veins. The SL0 sheath was exchanged for a 15F FlexCath (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), and a 28-mm Arctic Front Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter (Medtronic) was used to isolate all pulmonary veins. A hockey stick maneuver was required to engage the right inferior pulmonary vein. The next day, color flow interrogation with a transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a small interatrial defect and left-to-right shunt (Figure 1). Over the next 3 months, the patient continued to have episodes of PAF, and she was eventually brought back for radiofrequency ablation (RFA). An echocardiogram performed before the procedure demonstrated mild right ventricular (RV) dilation, ventricular septum diastolic flattening, and a stable shunt. During the RFA, the interatrial septum was crossed through the iatrogenic atrial septal defect (iASD) with two 8.5F sheaths, and all the electrically reconnected veins were isolated successfully. Within days after the procedure, the patient began experiencing increasing dyspnea on exertion and fatigue. Workup with transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (Figure 2) showed moderate right atrial and RV dilation, an RV systolic pressure of 40 mm Hg, and a large atrial septal defect with a rim up to 1.1 cm (Figure 3). There was a significant left-to-right interatrial",2015,Heart rhythm
Late Cretaceous (Turonian) Angiosperm Pollen from Tanzania: A Glimpse of Past Vegetation from a Warmer Climate,"ABSTRACT Exceptionally well-preserved palynomorphs were recovered from a Turonian section cored in Tanzania. Here we provide an in-depth evaluation of the terrestrial palynomorph assemblages recovered, discuss their environmental affinity, and provide taxonomic descriptions for seventeen angiosperm species. Forms present include various species of Liliacidites, Tricolpites, Tricolporites, Tetracolpites, Syncolporites, Triporopollenites, Hexaporotricolpites, and Periporopollenites. In addition to these angiosperm species, the palynological assemblage is dominated by gymnosperm genera that include Classopollis, Ephedripites, and Exesipollenites. This assemblage and the rarity of humidity-dependent bryophytes and pteridophytes clearly support the hypothesis that the Turonian climate in Tanzania was warm and relatively dry.",2019,Palynology
Influence of dendritic polyglycerol sulfates on knee osteoarthritis: an experimental study in the rat osteoarthritis model,"BackgroundAnti-inflammatory nanoparticular compounds could represent a strategy to diminish osteoarthritis (OA) progression.The present study was undertaken to prove the uptake of nanoparticular dendritic polyglycerol sulfates (dPGS) by rat-derived articular chondrocytes and to answer the question of whether dPGS could modulate knee joint cartilage degradation in a rat OA model and whether complications could arise.MethodsdPGS uptake and cytotoxicity was assessed in cultured primary rat-derived articular chondrocytes. Subsequently, OA was induced in the right knee joints of 12 male Wistar rats by medial collateral ligament and meniscus transection. Unoperated left knees remained as controls. Six weeks post surgery six rats were either treated daily (14√Ç¬†days) with 30√Ç¬†mg/kg dPGS (s.c.) or a similar volume of physiological saline. Animals were analyzed clinically for gait alterations. Explanted knee joints were studied histologically using OA scores according to Mankin (1971), Glasson et al., (2010) and the synovitis score according to Krenn et al., (2006). Liver, spleen and kidneys were analyzed for degenerative changes due to dPGS accumulation.ResultsdPGS was taken up after 2√Ç¬†hours by the chondrocytes. Whereas no significant clinical signs of OA could be detected, at the histological level, all operated rat knee joints revealed features of OA in the medial compartment. The values produced by both OA score systems were lower in rats treated with dPGS compared with saline-treated animals. Synovitis score did not significantly differ between the groups. The analyzed organs revealed no degenerative changes.ConclusionsdPGS presented overall cyto- and biocompatibility, no accumulation in metabolizing organs and chondroprotective properties in the osteoarthritic knee joint.",2015,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders

Asymptotic analysis of high-dimensional LAD regression with Lasso,"The Lasso is an attractive approach to variable selection in sparse, highdimensional regression models. Much work has been done to study the selection and estimation properties of the Lasso in the context of least squares regression. However, the least squares based method is sensitive to outliers. An alternative to the least squares method is the least absolute deviations (LAD) method which is robust to outliers in the responses. In this paper, we study the selection and estimation properties of the Lasso in LAD regression. We provide sufficient conditions under which the LAD-Lasso is estimation or selection consistent in sparse, high-dimensional settings. We use simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the LAD-Lasso, and compare the proposed method with the LS-Lasso in a range of generating models.",2016,
Thalassophryne nattereri fish venom: biological and biochemical characterization and serum neutralization of its toxic activities.,"Envenomation by Thalassophryne nattereri fishes are an important medical problem in northeast of Brazil, causing in human victims considerable pain and edema followed by necrosis. Venom obtained from fresh captured specimens of this fish was tested in vitro or in animal models for a better characterization of its toxic activities. Intradermal injection of the venom in the foot pad of mice induced local edema and hemorrhage followed a few hours later by necrosis. Subcutaneous injection of the venom induced systemic effects consisting in jerking motions, paralysis of hind limbs, erection of hair, rotational movements and violent convulsions followed by death. Dead animals showed hyperemia of the small intestine and lungs. The venom showed distinct edematous, necrotizing and hemolytic activities, a low level of hemorrhagic, myotoxic and proteolytic activities and no detectable phospholipase A2 activity. SDS-PAGE analysis of the crude venom showed at least 17 components with the major band located around Mw = 19,000. Almost all proteins stained by amido black were also revealed by Western blotting with antibodies to T. nattereri venom. Fractionation of the venom by either gel filtration or cation exchange chromatography resulted in a few distinct peaks but in both situations the biological activities were located in only one of the peaks which corresponded to basic proteins with approximately Mw = 47,000. Heating of the venom at 56 degrees C for 60 min completely destroyed its biological activities. All venom toxic activities except edema were completely neutralized after in vitro incubation with anti-T. nattereri serum.",1998,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology
Mass-conservative reconstruction of Galerkin velocity fields for transport simulations,"Accurate calculation of mass-conservative velocity fields from numerical solutions of Richards√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ equation is central to reliable surface√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúsubsurface flow and transport modeling, for example in long-term tracer simulations to determine catchment residence time distributions. In this study we assess the performance of a local Larson-Niklasson (LN) post-processing procedure for reconstructing mass-conservative velocities from a linear (P1) Galerkin finite element solution of Richards√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ equation. This approach, originally proposed for a-posteriori error estimation, modifies the standard finite element velocities by imposing local conservation on element patches. The resulting reconstructed flow field is characterized by continuous fluxes on element edges that can be efficiently used to drive a second order finite volume advective transport model. Through a series of tests of increasing complexity that compare results from the LN scheme to those using velocity fields derived directly from the P1 Galerkin solution, we show that a locally mass-conservative velocity field is necessary to obtain accurate transport results. We also show that the accuracy of the LN reconstruction procedure is comparable to that of the inherently conservative mixed finite element approach, taken as a reference solution, but that the LN scheme has much lower computational costs. The numerical tests examine steady and unsteady, saturated and variably saturated, and homogeneous and heterogeneous cases along with initial and boundary conditions that include dry soil infiltration, alternating solute and water injection, and seepage face outflow. Typical problems that arise with velocities derived from P1 Galerkin solutions include outgoing solute flux from no-flow boundaries, solute entrapment in zones of low hydraulic conductivity, and occurrences of anomalous sources and sinks. In addition to inducing significant mass balance errors, such manifestations often lead to oscillations in concentration values that can moreover cause the numerical solution to explode. These problems do not occur when using LN post-processed velocities.",2016,Advances in Water Resources
Re-evaluation of the systematics of two deep-sea species of Thalassometra (Echinodermata: Crinoidea) and its biogeographical implications,"Biogeography of deep-sea comatulid crinoids is poorly understood owing partly to the lack of detailed taxonomic studies. Recent cruises off Peru dredged up two new, well-preserved specimens of Thalassometra bispinosa, a deep-sea comatulid species which was heretofore only known from the Southern Ocean. These new records enabled re-evaluation of intra-specific variation for both quantitative and qualitative morphological characters. We thus provide a new description of the species, including these new specimens, and discuss the affinities with closely related species. As a consequence, we re-evaluate the systematic position of material previously assigned to T. bispinosa dredged from the Campbell Plateau, Southern Ocean. Discrete morphological characters, measurements and SEM photographs justify reassignment of these specimens to Thalassometra villosa. This species, another poorly known deep-sea comatulid crinoid previously known only from the Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific, is also redescribed. The biogeography of these two deep-sea comatulid species is discussed and hypotheses of their geographical distribution are proposed. La biogeographie des comatules profondes reste mal connue. Cette lacune est essentiellement due au manque de mat√É¬©riel. Deux campagnes IFREMER r√É¬©centes, effectu√É¬©es au large du P√É¬©rou, ont permis la r√É¬©colte de deux sp√É¬©cimens exceptionnellement conserv√É¬©s de Thalassometra bispinosa.

Penalized estimation equation for an extended single-index model,"The single-index model is a useful extension of the linear regression model. Cui et al. (Ann Stat 39:1658√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú1688, 2011) proposed an estimating function method for the estimation of index vector in an extended single-index model (ESIM). Nevertheless, how to conduct variable selection for ESIM has not been studied. To solve this problem, we penalize the estimating equation with some types of penalty, such as smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty and adaptive lasso penalty. Under some regularity conditions, the oracle property is established, i.e., the resulting estimator can be as efficient as the oracle estimator, thus we improve the explanatory ability and accuracy of estimator for the ESIM. A novel algorithm is proposed to solve the penalized estimating equation by combining quasi-Fisher scoring type algorithm and MM algorithm. Simulation study and real data application demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed estimators.",2017,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
Genetic Variation among Subspecies of Least Tern (Sterna antillarum): Implications for Conservation,"Abstract DNA sequence variation from two nuclear introns and part of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene were used to evaluate population structure among three subspecies of Least Tern that nest in the United States (California [Sterna antillarum browni], Interior [S. a. athalassos], Eastern [S. a. antillarum]). Sequence variation was highest for nuclear intron XI (Gadp) within the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. The second nuclear intron was fixed for the same allele in all subspecies. Fixation indices, FST and MST, for Gadp indicated genetic divergence between California and Interior subspecies. Estimates of nuclear gene flow were <4 individuals/generation, except between the Interior and Eastern subspecies (4 individuals/generation). Genetic indices for mitochondrial DNA did not differ among subspecies, and gene flows (reflecting female dispersal) ranged from 10 to 83 individuals/generation. Reservations are expressed about the validity of the current subspecific divisions and further research is required, including their taxonomic relationship to the Little Tern (Sterna albifrons).",2006,
Non-negative least squares for high-dimensional linear models: consistency and sparse recovery without regularization,"Least squares fitting is in general not useful for high-dimensional linear models, in which the number of predictors is of the same or even larger order of magnitude than the number of samples. Theory developed in recent years has coined a paradigm according to which sparsity-promoting regularization is regarded as a necessity in such setting. Deviating from this paradigm, we show that non-negativity constraints on the regression coefficients may be similarly effective as explicit regularization if the design matrix has additional properties, which are met in several applications of non-negative least squares (NNLS). We show that for these designs, the performance of NNLS with regard to prediction and estimation is comparable to that of the lasso. We argue further that in specific cases, NNLS may have a better $\ell_{\infty}$-rate in estimation and hence also advantages with respect to support recovery when combined with thresholding. From a practical point of view, NNLS does not depend on a regularization parameter and is hence easier to use.",2012,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Multiphase Liver MRI for Identifying the Macrotrabecular-Massive Subtype of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Background The recently described ""macrotrabecular-massive"" (MTM) histologic subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (MTM-HCC) represents an aggressive form of HCC and is associated with poor survival. Purpose To investigate whether preoperative MRI can help identify MTM-HCCs in patients with HCC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with HCC treated with surgical resection between January 2008 and February 2018 and who underwent preoperative multiphase contrast material-enhanced MRI. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-penalized and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify clinical, biologic, and imaging features associated with the MTM-HCC subtype. Early recurrence (within 2 years) and overall recurrence were evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of early and overall recurrence. Results One hundred fifty-two patients (median age, 64 years; interquartile range, 56-72 years; 126 men) with 152 HCCs were evaluated. Twenty-six of the 152 HCCs (17%) were MTM-HCCs. LASSO-penalized logistic regression analysis identified substantial necrosis, high serum √é¬±-fetoprotein (AFP) level (>100 ng/mL), and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C as independent features associated with MTM-HCCs. At multivariable analysis, substantial necrosis (odds ratio = 32; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.9, 114; P < .001), high serum AFP level (odds ratio = 4.4; 95% CI = 1.3, 16; P = .02), and BCLC stage B or C (odds ratio = 4.2; 95% CI = 1.2, 15; P = .03) were independent predictors of MTM-HCC subtype. Substantial necrosis helped identify 65% (17 of 26; 95% CI: 44%, 83%) of MTM-HCCs (sensitivity) with a specificity of 93% (117 of 126; 95% CI: 87%, 97%). In adjusted models, only the presence of satellite nodules was independently associated with both early (hazard ratio = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.5, 9.4; P = .006) and overall (hazard ratio = 3.0; 95% CI: 1.3, 7.2; P = .01) tumor recurrence.

A Note on the Adaptive LASSO for Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression,"We consider the problem of modelling count data with excess zeros using Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression. Recently, various regularization methods have been developed for variable selection in ZIP models. Among these, EM LASSO is a popular method for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation. However, EM LASSO suffers from estimation inefficiency and selection inconsistency. To remedy these problems, we propose a set of EM adaptive LASSO methods using a variety of data-adaptive weights. We show theoretically that the new methods are able to identify the true model consistently, and the resulting estimators can be as efficient as oracle. The methods are further evaluated through extensive synthetic experiments and applied to a German health care demand dataset.",2018,Journal of Probability and Statistics
GG-05 Predictive ability of SLE genetic risk factors varies across ethnicities,"Background Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) exhibits marked ethnic disparities. The SLE Immunochip Consortium√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s transancestral association study of SLE (27√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞574 individuals of European (EA), African (AA) and Hispanic Amerindian (HA) ancestry) raised the number of common risk variants to >100 (Langefeld 2017). There, we proposed the cumulative hit hypothesis, where the cumulative effect of individual loci is greater than if each locus acted independently. Here, we explore the joint contribution of SLE-susceptibility loci, how it varies by ethnicity, and whether there are distinct genetic risk profiles. Methods The SLE Immunochip study design, identification of risk loci, and genetic load (risk allele count (RAC) in EA samples) were previously described (Langefeld 2017). Genetic load was tested for association with SLE in an independent set of 2000/2000 EA case/controls, and in the AA and HA cohorts. Individuals in lowest 10% of the RAC distribution were the reference sample. A logistic regression model, adjusting for admixture, computed the odds ratio (OR) comparing the reference group to samples within a moving window of 20 unweighted RAC (moving window of 4 for the weighted (SNP√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s log(OR)) analysis). Lasso regression identified EA risk SNPs that maximally predict SLE status in EA, then applied prediction to AA and HA. Factor analysis identified individual genetic risk profiles. Results The OR comparing lowest versus highest 10% of RAC was √¢ÀÜ¬º30,√¢ÀÜ¬º6, and √¢ÀÜ¬º3 for EA, HA and AA, respectively (figure 1), showing EA risk loci were not highly predictive of SLE risk in HA and AA. In EA, the moving window genetic load OR showed an increase beyond that predicted by independence but did not in HA and AA due to lower predictive ability. Lasso regression identified 51 risk alleles that maximally predicted SLE in EA, and a factor analysis identified seven uncorrelated risk profiles (one driven by HLA alleles and six by non-HLA loci). The lasso identified 31 (3 HLA) and 8 (no HLA) EA risk alleles as predictive in the HA and AA, respectively. Using predicted probabilities from the lasso in EA, the area under the ROC curve was 0.75 for EA, 0.72 for HA, and 0.60 for AA. Conclusions The EA SLE risk loci are highly predictive in EA (with a greater than additive effect), modestly predictive in HA, and weakly predictive in AA. We posit that the SLE genetics of AA are meaningfully different from EA and HA, merit increased study, and will require ethnicity-informed treatment strategies.

Local Regression Model for Automatic Face Sketch Generation,"As one of the important artistic styles of portrait, sketch portrait has wide applications for both digital entertainment and law enforcement. In this paper, an automatic face sketch generation approach is presented by learning from photo-sketch pair examples. Specifically, the relationship between a face photo and its corresponding face sketch is learned on image patch level. By applying this relationship to the input face photo patch, we can infer the output face sketch patch by exploiting some regression techniques such as kNN, the Lasso and so on. Via our local regression model, we can synthesize an appealing sketch portrait from a given face photo in a few minutes. Experiments conducted on CUHK database have shown that our results are more compelling than previous methods especially in two respects: (1) our synthesized sketches preserve more identity information of the original face photo, (2) our synthesized sketches presents more pencil sketch texture.",2011,2011 Sixth International Conference on Image and Graphics
A group VISA algorithm for variable selection,"We consider the problem of selecting grouped variables in a linear regression model based on penalized least squares. The group-Lasso and the group-Lars procedures are designed for automatically performing both the shrinkage and the selection of important groups of variables. However, since the same tuning parameter is used (as in Lasso or Lars ) for both group variable selection and shrinkage coefficients, it can lead to over shrinkage the significant groups of variables or inclusion of many irrelevant groups of predictors. This situation occurs when the true number of non-zero groups of coefficients is small relative to the number $$p$$p of variables. We introduce a novel sparse regression method, called the Group-VISA (GVISA), which extends the VISA effect to grouped variables. It combines the idea of VISA algorithm which avoids the over shrinkage problem of regression coefficients and the idea of the GLars-type estimator which shrinks and selects the members of the group together. Hence, GVISA is able to select a sparse group model by avoiding the over shrinkage of GLars-type estimator. We distinguish two variants of the GVISA algorithm, each one is associated with each version of GLars (I and II). Moreover, we provide a path algorithm, similar to GLars, for efficiently computing the entire sample path of GVISA coefficients. We establish a theoretical property on sparsity inequality of GVISA estimator that is a non-asymptotic bound on the estimation error. A detailed simulation study in small and high dimensional settings is performed, which illustrates the advantages of the new approach in relation to several other possible methods. Finally, we apply GVISA on two real data sets.",2015,Statistical Methods & Applications
TU-AB-BRA-10: Prognostic Value of Intra-Radiation Treatment FDG-PET and CT Imaging Features in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer,"Purpose: To predict response to radiation treatment using computational FDG-PET and CT images in locally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC). Methods: 68 patients with State III-IVB HNC treated with chemoradiation were included in this retrospective study. For each patient, we analyzed primary tumor and lymph nodes on PET and CT scans acquired both prior to and during radiation treatment, which led to 8 combinations of image datasets. From each image set, we extracted high-throughput, radiomic features of the following types: statistical, morphological, textural, histogram, and wavelet, resulting in a total of 437 features. We then performed unsupervised redundancy removal and stability test on these features. To avoid over-fitting, we trained a logistic regression model with simultaneous feature selection based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). To objectively evaluate the prediction ability, we performed 5-fold cross validation (CV) with 50 random repeats of stratified bootstrapping. Feature selection and model training was solely conducted on the training set and independently validated on the holdout test set. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the pooled Result and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated as figure of merit. Results: For predicting local-regional recurrence, our model built on pre-treatment PET of lymph nodes achieved the best performance (AUC=0.762) on 5-fold CV, which compared favorably with node volume and SUVmax (AUC=0.704 and 0.449, p<0.001). Wavelet coefficients turned out to be the most predictive features. Prediction of distant recurrence showed a similar trend, in which pre-treatment PET features of lymph nodes had the highest AUC of 0.705. Conclusion: The radiomics approach identified novel imaging features that are predictive to radiation treatment response.

For a given vector $c$, the pareto frontier describes the possible values of $(\|a\|_X,\|b\|_Y)$ for a decomposition $c=a+b$. The singular value decomposition of a matrix is closely related to the Pareto frontier for the spectral and nuclear norm. We will develop a general theory that extends the notion of singular values of a matrix to arbitrary finite dimensional euclidean vector spaces equipped with dual norms. This also generalizes the diagonal singular value decompositions for tensors introduced by the author in previous work. We can apply the results to denoising, where $c$ is a noisy signal, $a$ is a sparse signal and $b$ is noise. Applications include 1D total variation denoising, 2D total variation Rudin-Osher-Fatemi image denoising, LASSO, basis pursuit denoising and tensor decompositions.",2018,SIAM J. Appl. Algebra Geom.
"ADS-J1, an entry inhibitor targeting gp41, prevents HIV-1 transmission in the in vitro and ex vivo models.","TEXT Background: We have previously demonstrated that ADS-J1 is a potent HIV fusion inhibitor by targeting gp41. Due to its large molecular size, it is unlikely to be used as an orally applicable anti-HIV drug, but it may be developed as a microbicide for preventing sexual transmission of HIV. Methodology: We used a dye transfer assay to detect HIV-1 mediated cell fusion and an ELISA to test p24 antigen. The inhibitory activity of ADS-J1 against infection by cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 in the cervical explants and cell cultures was quantitated by measuring p24 production or reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. The cytotoxicity of ADS-J1 on vaginal epithelial cells was evaluated by a luciferase assay. Results: ADS-J1 blocked HIV-1-mediated cell fusion and inhibited infection of MT-2 cells by HIV-1 X4 virus (IIIB) and of dendritic cells (DCs), monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and cervical explants by R5 virus (BaL) at low √é¬ºM range. Furthermore, ADS-J1 could block transmission of cellassociated primary HIV-1 isolates from DCs to PBMCs, from MDMs to PBMCs and from PBMCs to CEMx174 5.25M7 cells. It has low in vitro cytotoxic effect on vaginal epithelial cells (VK2/E6E7). Conclusion: ADS-J1 is an HIV entry inhibitor targeting gp41 with potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 transmission in both the in vitro and ex vivo models. It may be developed as a tropical microbicide for prevention of sexual transmission of HIV.

Ultra-fast preselection in lasso-type spatio-temporal solar forecasting problems,"Abstract Solar forecasting using data collected by satellites or sensor networks is often framed as a many-predictor spatio-temporal regression problem. Whereas the regressand is the irradiance at the focal location, the regressors could be the irradiance at any neighboring location with any time lag. Lasso√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthe least absolute shrinkage and selection operator√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùis commonly used for regressor selection and regularization in order to enhance the forecast accuracy and interpretability of the regression model. However, when the number of regressors is much larger than the number of samples, lasso-type regressions are limited by the curse of dimensionality and the insufficient degree of freedom. The ultra-fast preselection algorithm herein proposed provides a remedy to the above-mentioned problem. The algorithm uses (probably) the world√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fastest similarity search routine, and preselects a user-defined number of most-relevant regressors based on the z-normalized Euclidean distance. The preselected regressors are then fed to lasso for forecasting. The algorithm is completely free from the curse of dimensionality, and does not require any meteorological prior, such as wind information or cloud vector field. It is customizable for other forecasting methods, such as vector autoregression or kriging, and can be implemented in just 10 lines of code.",2018,Solar Energy
Selection properties of type II maximum likelihood (empirical Bayes) in linear models with individual variance components for predictors,"Maximum likelihood (ML) in the linear model overfits when the number of predictors (M) exceeds the number of objects (N). One of the possible solution is the relevance vector machine (RVM) which is a form of automatic relevance detection and has gained popularity in the pattern recognition machine learning community by the famous textbook of Bishop (2006). RVM assigns individual precisions to weights of predictors which are then estimated by maximizing the marginal likelihood (type II ML or empirical Bayes). We investigated the selection properties of RVM both analytically and by experiments in a regression setting. We show analytically that RVM selects predictors when the absolute z-ratio (|least squares estimate|/standard error) exceeds 1 in the case of orthogonal predictors and, for M=2, that this still holds true for correlated predictors when the other z-ratio is large. RVM selects the stronger of two highly correlated predictors. In experiments with real and simulated data, RVM is outcompeted by other popular regularization methods (LASSO and/or PLS) in terms of the prediction performance. We conclude that type II ML is not the general answer in high dimensional prediction problems. In extensions of RVM to obtain stronger selection, improper priors (based on the inverse gamma family) have been assigned to the inverse precisions (variances) with parameters estimated by penalized marginal likelihood. We critically assess this approach and suggest a proper variance prior related to the Beta distribution which gives similar selection and shrinkage properties and allows a fully Bayesian treatment.",2012,Pattern Recognit.

"Blockwise coordinate descent procedures for the multi-task lasso, with applications to neural semantic basis discovery","We develop a cyclical blockwise coordinate descent algorithm for the multi-task Lasso that efficiently solves problems with thousands of features and tasks. The main result shows that a closed-form Winsorization operator can be obtained for the sup-norm penalized least squares regression. This allows the algorithm to find solutions to very large-scale problems far more efficiently than existing methods. This result complements the pioneering work of Friedman, et al. (2007) for the single-task Lasso. As a case study, we use the multi-task Lasso as a variable selector to discover a semantic basis for predicting human neural activation. The learned solution outperforms the standard basis for this task on the majority of test participants, while requiring far fewer assumptions about cognitive neuroscience. We demonstrate how this learned basis can yield insights into how the brain represents the meanings of words.",2009,
Compendium of standard Diagnostic protocols for Animal trypanosomoses of african origin,"This Compendium has been compiled to serve as a reference tool for the diagnostic methods for trypanosomoses used at the OIE Reference Laboratory for Animal Trypanosomoses of African Origin, CIRAD, Montpellier, France, and its partner laboratory, CIRDES, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. It was generated in the framework of the CIRAD-CIRDES Twinning project of the OIE for the Reference laboratory on animal trypanosomes of African origin (2012-2017). The Compendium describes the standard parasitological, serological and molecular biology methods recommended by the OIE for the diagnosis of African trypanosomoses, as published in Chapter 2.4.17 'TRYPANOSOMOSIS (tsetse-transmitted)' of the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals (hereafter, the Terrestrial Manual). It describes the main characteristics of these methods, enabling users to correctly interpret the results of the tests. It describes all the protocols in detail so that other regional or national laboratories can use these methods to carry out tests independently of OIE Reference Laboratories. However, it is recommended that permanent links are maintained with these Reference Laboratories for quality control purposes.

"Riqualificazione urbana della zona culturale del Municipio Libertador a Caracas, Venezuela : connettore tra il Parque Los Caobos, la UCV e la Zona Rental de Plaza Venezuela","Il processo evolutivo delle citta durante il secolo XIX e XX, e stato molto accelerato. Sappiamo che l'industrializzazione ha provocato l'inizio della migrazione verso le citta, e quello ha provocato il suo collasso. In seguito il processo di trasformazione urbana e passato attraverso molteplici crisi che ci obbligano a pensare nella pianificazione futura delle citta per soddisfare i bisogni. 
Attualmente il tema della pianificazione urbana si orienta verso la necessita di risolvere i problemi che sono emersi dagli eccessi e gli abusi della societa e la sua forma di abitare. Il problema ambientale dei cambi climatici accelerati, gli elevati ritmi di produzione, le disuguaglianza sociale, i problemi economici e politici, si riflettono nelle nostre citta e nel nostro modo di vivere. Per affrontare questi problemi si e iniziato lo studio ed analisi della necessita; e si sono cominciate ad identificare alcune alternative orientate alla ricerca della sostenibilita e la forma in cui si puo integrare nella nostra vita. 
L'applicazione del concetto di sostenibilita e un processo in sviluppo. Ogni esperienza e un passo avanti per raggiungere una realta equilibrata ed armoniosa con l'ambiente. Dentro alle citta e difficile applicare questo concetto che a volte puo essere utopistico dovuto al fatto che gli altri problemi possono avere piu importanza, come per esempio il bisogno di costruire case, servizi pubblici e spazi urbani sufficienti per tutti gli abitanti. In questa descrizione si riflette la citta di Caracas-Venezuela; citta che ha un accelerato processo di trasformazione urbana, responsabile dei suoi problemi attuali. La mancanza dell'infrastruttura necessaria per tutta la popolazione, causa altre problematiche sociali che degradano la citta. Caracas, ha una gran potenzialita per svilupparsi ed evitare maggiori problemi futuri. 
L'obiettivo di questo lavoro di tesi e identificare il problema e possibili soluzioni degli spazi urbani della citta; come si puo migliorare l'esistente e pianificare il nuovo, attraverso lo sviluppo sostenibile. Si cerchera anche il modo di applicare questo rinnovamento nella citta di Caracas per conseguire un migliore funzionamento.",2010,
Combination of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with Bayesian Regularization artificial neural network (LASSO-BR-ANN) for QSAR studies using functional group and molecular docking mixed descriptors,"Abstract A combination of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with Bayesian Regularization feed-forward artificial neural network (LASSO-BR-ANN) was used as a new approach in the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. A mixture of the docking derived descriptors with the simple functional group (structural) features was also introduced as a new ensemble of descriptors for accurate QSAR modeling. The performance of introduced approaches was tested with QSAR modeling of the biological activities (pEC50) of 73 azine derivatives as new non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) for treatment of HIV disease. Molecular docking descriptors (MDDs) were generated from ligand-receptor interactions and functional group features derived using Dragon 5.5 software. The dataset was divided into three sets of training, validation, and test data. LASSO, as a penalized regression method, was applied to the training data set for the selection of the most relevant descriptors among the mixture of the structural and MDDs. LASSO selected descriptors were used as inputs in the construction of the Bayesian Regularization artificial neural network (BR-ANN) model. The results showed that the addition of functional group properties to the MDDs improves the accuracy of the model. Under the optimum conditions, LASSO-BR-ANN was successfully applied for the prediction of PEC50 values for compounds in the external test set with mean square error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.07 and 0.88, respectively. Some of the prediction statistical parameters of the model were calculated and all of them were in their acceptable ranges, which confirm the validity of the proposed QSAR model.",2020,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems
RANK-BASED ESTIMATION OF NONPARANORMAL GRAPHICAL MODELS 2543 TABLE 1 Testing for normality of the gene expression measurements in the Arabidposis thaliana data,"A sparse precision matrix can be directly translated into a sparse Gaussian graphical model under the assumption that the data follow a joint normal distribution. This neat property makes high-dimensional precision matrix estimation very appealing in many applications. However, in practice we often face nonnormal data, and variable transformation is often used to achieve normality. In this paper we consider the nonparanormal model that assumes that the variables follow a joint normal distribution after a set of unknown monotone transformations. The nonparanormal model is much more flexible than the normal model while retaining the good interpretability of the latter in that each zero entry in the sparse precision matrix of the nonparanormal model corresponds to a pair of conditionally independent variables. In this paper we show that the nonparanormal graphical model can be efficiently estimated by using a rank-based estimation scheme which does not require estimating these unknown transformation functions. In particular, we study the rank-based graphical lasso, the rank-based neighborhood Dantzig selector and the rank-based CLIME. We establish their theoretical properties in the setting where the dimension is nearly exponentially large relative to the sample size. It is shown that the proposed rank-based estimators work as well as their oracle counterparts defined with the oracle data. Furthermore, the theory motivates us to consider the adaptive version of the rank-based neighborhood Dantzig selector and the rank-based CLIME that are shown to enjoy graphical model selection consistency without assuming the irrepresentable condition for the oracle and rank-based graphical lasso. Simulated and real data are used to demonstrate the finite performance of the rank-based estimators.",2013,
Initial Molecular Recognition Steps of McjA Precursor during Microcin J25 Lasso Peptide Maturation.,"Microcin J25 (MccJ25) has emerged as an excellent model to understand the maturation of ribosomal precursor peptides into the entangled lasso fold. MccJ25 biosynthesis relies on the post-translational modification of the precursor McjA by the ATP-dependent protease McjB and the lactam synthetase McjC. Here, using NMR spectroscopy, we showed that McjA is an intrinsically disordered protein without detectable conformational preference, which emphasizes the active role of the maturation machinery on the three-dimensional folding of MccJ25. We further showed that the N-terminal region of the leader peptide is involved in interaction with both maturation enzymes and identified a predominant interaction of V43-S55 in the core McjA sequence with McjC. Moreover, we demonstrated that residues K23-Q34 in the N-terminal McjA leader peptide tend to adopt a helical conformation in the presence of membrane mimics, implying a role in directing McjA to the membrane in the vicinity of the lasso synthetase/export machinery. These data provide valuable insights into the initial molecular recognition steps in the MccJ25 maturation process.",2016,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology
Influence of intercropping: spider fauna in pure sorghum and intercropped sorghum-cowpea in Burkina Faso,"A two-year study was conducted at Matourkou near Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso (West Africa), to study the spider fauna in pure sorghum and intercropped sorghum-cowpea, Sorghum bicolor L. (Moench) - Vigna inguculata (Walp.), associated with the sorghum shoot fly, Atherigona soccata Rondani (Dipt., Muscidae). Sampling was done weekly, on six occasions starting 10 days after sowing. Significant differences were observed with respect to the number of individuals in the specific composition of spider fauna from different cropping systems. Juvenile spiders represented 84 and 75 % of the total number of spiders in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Twelve families and 24 genera were recorded. In pure sorghum, the most important families were Thomisidae (7.73%) and Salticidae (4.12%) whereas Araneidae (15.15%), Theridiidae (8.77%), Thomisidae (8.76%) and Linyphiidae (7.22%) were predominant in sorghum-cowpea. In pure cowpea, Linyphiidae (6.69%), Pisauridae (6.18%), and Theridiidae (4.63%) were predominant. Four species were identified: Latrodectus geometricus C. L. Koch, Meioneta prosectes Locket, Pardosa injucunda O. P. Cbr, and Steatoda badia Roewer. Latrodectus geometricus and P. injucunda were only recorded in sorghum-cowpea. The Sorenson's index of similarity between sorghum and sorghum-cowpea, whereas M. prosectes and S. badia were common to the three cropping systems. Five species namely Araneus sp., M. prosectes, Misumenops sp., Neoscona sp., and S. badia showed preference for the intercropped sorghum-cowpea, and between cowpea and sorghum-cowpea was 0.75 and 0.66 respectively suggesting that spider species composition was relatively independent of the cropping system.

Zum Einflus von Mischkulturen: Spinnenfauna in Reinbestanden von Sorghum bicolor im Vergleich zur Mischkultur mit Vigna inguculata 
 
 
 
In Matourkou, Westafrika, wurde eine zweijahrige Untersuchung durchgefuhrt, um die Spinnenfauna zwischen Sorghum-bicolor-Reinkulturen und in Mischkultur mit Vigna inguculata zu vergleichen. Ab dem 10. Tag nach der Saat wurden wochentlich Stichproben genommen. Es konnten signifikante Unterschiede in bezug auf die Individuenzahl verschiedener Spinnenarten in Abhangigkeit von den Kulturen festgestellt werden. Der Anteil juveniler Spinnen betrug 1990 84%, 1991 75%. Es wurden Spinnen aus 12 Familien und 24 Gattungen gefunden. In der Sorghum-Reinkultur waren Thomisidae (7,73%) und Salticidae (4,12%) die bedeutendsten Familien; in der Mischkultur stellten Araneidae (15,15%), Theridiidae (8,77%), Thomisidae (8,76%) und Linyphiidae (7,22%) die wichtigsten Familien dar. In Vigna-Reinkulturen betrug der Anteil von Linyphiidae 6,69%, Pisauridae 6,18% und Theridiidae 4,63%. Es konnten vier Arten bestimmt werden: Latrodectus geometricus C. L. Koch, Meioneta prosectus Locket, Pardosa injucunda O. P. Cbr. und Steatoda badia Roewer. Latrodectus geometricus und P. injucunda konnten nur in Mischkulturen gefunden werden, wogegen M. prosectus und S. badia in allen drei Kulturen auftraten. Funf Arten, namlich Araneus sp., M. prosectus, Misumenops sp., Neoscona sp. und S. badia zeigten eine Bevorzugung fur die Mischkulturen. Der Sorenson's Index zwischen Sorghum/Vigna betrug 0,75 bzw. 0,66, was bedeutet, das die Artenzusammensetzung der Spinnen relativ unabhangig von der Kulturart ist.",1993,Journal of Applied Entomology
"Middle Jurassic Sporo-pollen Assemblages in Northern Turpan Depression, Xinjiang, Northwest China","Eighty-one species of fossil spores and pollen assigned to 52 genera are found from the Middle Jurassic Xishanyao,Sanjianfang and Qiketai Formations of boreholes Le 1, Mi 1, Shan 1 and Dun 1 in the northern Turpan Depression, Xinjiang, northwest China. Three assemblages have been proposed as: √Æ‚Ç¨‚Ä†Cyathidites-Psophosphaera-Cycadopites√Æ‚Ç¨‚Ä† assemblage, √Æ‚Ç¨‚Ä†Cyathidites-Quadraeculina-Classopollis√Æ‚Ç¨‚Ä† assemblage and √Æ‚Ç¨‚Ä†Cyathidites-Callialasporites-Classopollis√Æ‚Ç¨‚Ä† assemblage obtained from the Xishanyao Formation, the Sanjianfang Formation and Qiketai Formation respectively. Based on the sporo-pollen assemblage features and correlation,their geological ages are regarded as of Middle Jurassic,probably Aalenian to Bathonian.The results of the study indicate that the vegetation of early Middle Jurassic in this region consisted mainly of Gymnospermae of Ginkgoaceae of Cycadales, Podocarpaceae, Pinaceae and Pteridophyta of Cyatheaceae, Osmundaceae, Lycopodiaceae and Dicksoniaceae, etc. They reflect a warm-moist subtropic climate.To the middle-late Middle Jurassic, Cheirolepidaceae was dominant in the vegetation, which indicates that the climate was in the trend of becoming dry.",2002,
Energetics of nestling growth and parental effort in Antarctic fulmarine petrels.,"Antarctic fulmarine petrels breed in some of the coldest conditions encountered by any bird and their young grow twice as fast as predicted allometrically. To examine the energetic consequences of fast growth in a cold environment, we used the doubly labeled water technique to measure field metabolic rates of adults (three species) and different-aged nestlings (four species) of Antarctic fulmarine petrels in the Rauer Islands, East Antarctica: Antarctic fulmar Fulmarus glacialoides, Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, Cape petrel Daption capense and snow petrel Pagodroma nivea. We used our data to assess parental effort and, together with literature values on nestling growth and resting metabolic rate, to construct and partition nestling energy budgets. Nestling total energy expenditure and peak daily metabolic rate were significantly higher than predicted allometrically (33-73% and 17-66% higher, respectively), and the relative cost of growth in nestling petrels was among the highest reported for birds (54-72 kJ g(-1)). Parental effort during the nestling-feeding period was identical in adult Cape and Antarctic petrels (3.5 times basal metabolic rate, BMR), and was somewhat (but not significantly) higher in snow petrels (4.6 times BMR). These values are comparable to those of other high-latitude procellariiform birds. Thus, despite the constraints of a compressed breeding season, cold temperatures and fast-growing nestlings, adult Antarctic fulmarine petrels do not work harder than procellariid adults whose chicks grow much more slowly. Our findings suggest that obtaining sufficient food is generally not a constraint for adult fulmarine petrels and that factors operating at the tissue level limit nestling growth rate.",2003,The Journal of experimental biology
Knowledge Sharing,"Knowledge sharing (KS) is critical to organizations that wish to use their knowledge as an asset to achieve competitive advantage. Knowledge management systems (KMSs) can be primary enablers of knowledge sharing in an organization. A major focus of knowledge sharing is on the individual who can explicate, encode, and communicate knowledge to other individuals, groups, and organizations. In particular, the employment of some KMSs requires individuals to contribute their knowledge to a system rather than keeping it to themselves or sharing it only through personal exchanges. Another major focus of knowledge sharing is on knowledge sharing in teams since teams have become so prominent in management thought and practice, and because some of the long-presumed benefits of teams such as √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhigher labor productivity, a flatter management structure and reduced employee turnover√¢‚Ç¨¬ù have been validated (Glassop, 2002, p. 227). A major distinction between knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer (terms that may sometimes be used interchangeably) is that transfer implies focus, a clear objective, and unidirectionality, while knowledge may be shared in unintended ways multiple directionally without a specific objective (see article titled √¢‚Ç¨≈ìKnowledge Transfer√¢‚Ç¨¬ù). Of course, knowledge may also be shared in intended ways, such as when a team attempts to develop mutual knowledge, a common ground, or knowledge that the parties know they share in common (Cramton, 2001).",2011,
A friend in need: evaluating the impact of Lifebox in Burkina Faso,"The letter from Bougouma et al. in this issue of the Journal should be of great interest to readers, especially to members of the Canadian Anesthesiologists√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ Society (CAS). It outlines the impact of a gift from CAS members to colleagues in Burkina Faso. In 2012, Professor Franco Carli, then Chair of the Board of the CAS International Education Foundation (CASIEF), was contacted by an anesthesia resident in Burkina Faso asking if the CAS could help with supplying training materials for their residency program. The Board of CASIEF responded by offering to provide 117 pulse oximeters. Additional oximeters (including pediatric oximetry probes) were donated by the Lifebox Foundation. Working with the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) and Lifebox, a team arrived in Burkina Faso in 2013 to deliver the oximeters and to provide the education necessary for their use. Workshops were held at the Blaise Compaor√É¬© Hospital in Ouagadougou (the capital) and at the University Hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso, the second largest city in Burkina Faso. Our first task was to familiarize local faculty with the teaching materials as well as our teaching methods, which included small group sessions and handson workshops (which were all delivered in French). Together, we then ran the program for 118 participants who were mainly non-physician anesthesia providers. The course included an introduction to using the Surgical Safety Checklist (SSCL). Dr. Bougouma√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s letter highlights the improvements in patient monitoring that followed. Almost one year after the workshops, he personally telephoned each of the in-charge anesthetists at the 57 hospitals that received oximeters. All the hospitals were systematically using them in the operating rooms and 94% of the hospitals were using them in their postanesthesia care units (PACU). Both CASIEF and Lifebox subsequently donated more oximeters specifically for the PACUs. What is more surprising is that 68% of the surveyed hospitals were using the SSCL some of the time and 23% were using it systematically. It is arguably easy to teach anesthesia providers to use an oximeter√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthe take-up is rapid because it makes their job easier. Nevertheless, it is a very different story when the whole surgical team is involved with the SSCL and the possible improved outcomes are not always immediately evident. Sixty-four percent of those Bougouma et al. surveyed suggested education of the whole surgical team. Accordingly, it is the intention of the CASIEF team to return to Burkina Faso to do just that, using a new program recently developed by a consortium of anesthesia, surgery, and nursing groups. It is called SAFE-OR and is currently in the pilot phase. SAFE is an acronym for Safer Anesthesia From Education, which includes SAFE-OB (Obstetric Anesthesia), SAFE-Peds (Pediatric Anesthesia), and now SAFE-OR (Operating Room). The simple interaction of asking for help and receiving it has had unexpected spin-off effects. It has led to the development of a long-term relationship between CASIEF and our colleagues in Burkina Faso. They have become part of the CASIEF family and several projects have grown from this.

Cluster-Based Multi-Target Localization under Partial Observations,"Compressive sensing (CS) has been applied to reduce the acquisition costs in the task of target localization by deploying a small number of sensors to collect measurements. It is based on a fact that the number of targets is much smaller than all possible positions where the targets could be located. To improve the localization accuracy with noisy measurements, our previous work has proposed a localization approach by solving a row-based least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (RLASSO) formulation, which utilizes the joint sparsity property. However, some practical concerns in localization implementation, e.g., a decrement in power radiated by targets and an enlargement of overall localization region, degrade the localization accuracy seriously. The performance impairment is caused by the common but undesirable limitations that the reduced radiation power and the enlarged field indeed make targets partially unobservable from individual sensor alone. To combat the impacts of such constrains on localization performance, this paper develops a cluster-based multi-target localization approach based on matrix rank minimization (MRM). The solutions representing all the collected measurements from distributed clusters are modeled to possess a low rank property. Capitalizing on this low rank property, a nuclear norm minimization problem is formulated to localize the positions of multiple targets. Simulation results reveal that the proposed localization approach based on MRM outperforms those via RLASSO and direct CS, since the low rank property enables efficient utilization of user diversity in localization even under partial observations.",2015,2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)

Les sepsis post-splenectomies ont ete repertoriees et leur incidence analysee en fonction du type de splenectomie. L'hypersplenisme etait l'indication de la splenectomie dans 100√Ç¬†% des cas. La splenectomie totale etait effectuee dans huit cas contre trois splenectomies partielles. Les variations des moyennes des globules rouges etaient significativement plus importantes en post-operatoire immediat ( p √Ç¬†=√Ç¬†0,01), et ( p √Ç¬†=√Ç¬†0,016) un mois apres. Le taux d'hemoglobine augmentait significativement de 1 point 6 dans le post-operatoire immediat et de 2 points 2 a un mois post-operatoire. L'augmentation du taux d'hemoglobine etait significativement plus importante apres la splenectomie partielle ( p √Ç¬†=√Ç¬†0,016). L'incidence des sepsis post-splenectomies etait de 27√Ç¬†% apres splenectomie totale. Deux recidives de splenomegalie ont ete notees sur trois splenectomies partielles. Les splenectomies favorisent surtout la croissance de la lignee erythrocytaire et le taux d'hemoglobine. Elles constituent une bonne indication de l'hypersplenisme au cours de la drepanocytose ou de la thalassemie.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy drainage of an excluded left hepatic lobe in a hybrid way with percutaneous assistance,"A 48-year-old woman was referred for the management of an excluded left hepatic lobe (LHL) with recurrent cholangitis after right hepatectomy extended to the segment 1 and wedge resection of the segment 2 for the treatment of an occlusive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon previously treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and local resection. The crossing of the stricture of the left intrahepatic bile ducts (LIHBDs) was not successful with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). A permanent percutaneous external biliary drainage was performed through segment 3 biliary branch, complicated with pain and bile leakage around the drain. A first attempt by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS) did not succeed given the absence of dilation of the LIHBD and mostly due to an unstable position induced by a small size of the remnant LHL. Then, a hybrid procedure was performed after changing the percutaneous drain for a 5Fr Arrow-Flex introducer that permitted the puncture of the external part of the introducer with an EUS transgastric EchoTip √Ç¬Æ 19G needle and insertion of a 0.025-inch guidewire directly into the LIHBD around the introducer. The introducer was removed and the guidewire was caught in the hepatic segment 2 by a percutaneous lasso to stabilize the 0.025-inch guidewire. An EUS-HGS was done after fistulization of the transhepatic tract by 6Fr cystotome and placement of a partially-covered self-expandable metal stents. The clinical course was uncomplicated under vancomycin for an Enterococcus faecium bacteremia, and then chemotherapy was restarted. EUS-HGS is clearly established as an alternative technique for biliary drainage in case of unsuccessful ERCP or altered anatomy, based on decisional algorithm, with a pooled technical success rate of 82%, clinical success rate of 97%, and adverse event rate of 23%. The success of this procedure depends on several factors and tips like the kind and length of the intragastric part of the prosthesis, angulation of the LIHBD, oversized dilation of the transhepatic tract, access to the liver segment 3, and shearing of the guidewire. The low volume of the LHL may also be a cause of technical failure that can be resolved by new procedures as described in this case.",2017,Endoscopic Ultrasound
A prognostic index (PI) as a moderator of outcomes in the treatment of depression: A proof of concept combining multiple variables to inform risk-stratified stepped care models.,"BACKGROUND
Prognostic indices (PIs) combining variables to predict future depression risk may help guide the selection of treatments that differ in intensity. We develop a PI and show its promise in guiding treatment decisions between treatment as usual (TAU), treatment starting with a low-intensity treatment (brief therapy (BT)), or treatment starting with a high-intensity treatment intervention (cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)).


METHODS
We utilized data from depressed patients (N=622) who participated in a randomized comparison of TAU, BT, and CBT in which no statistically significant differences in the primary outcomes emerged between the three treatments. We developed a PI by predicting depression risk at follow-up using a LASSO-style bootstrap variable selection procedure. We then examined between-treatment differences in outcome as a function of the PI.


RESULTS
Unemployment, depression severity, hostility, sleep problems, and lower positive emotionality at baseline predicted a lower likelihood of recovery across treatments. The PI incorporating these variables produced a fair classification accuracy (c=0.73). Among patients with a high PI (75% percent of the sample), recovery rates were high and did not differ between treatments (79-86%). Among the patients with the poorest prognosis, recovery rates were substantially higher in the CBT condition (60%) than in TAU (39%) or BT (44%).


LIMITATIONS
No information on additional treatment sought. Prospective tests needed.


CONCLUSION
Replicable PIs may aid treatment selection and help streamline stepped models of care. Differences between treatments for depression that differ in intensity may only emerge for patients with the poorest prognosis.",2017,Journal of affective disorders

Subversive K√É¬∂rperlichkeit am Beispiel des Romans Feuchtgebiete von Charlotte Roche,"Charlotte Roche zeichnet in ihrem 2008 erschienenen Roman Feuchtgebiete ein weibliches Korperbild, das sich dem gesellschaftlich propagierten Idealbild des schonen, makellosen und reinen Frauenkorpers widersetzt. 
Diese Arbeit soll zeigen, inwiefern der Text in seiner Schreibtendenz als Verweigerungsstrategie von hegemonialen Diskursen uber den weiblichen Korper gelesen werden kann. Dazu werden zunachst ausgewahlte soziokulturelle, philosophische und feministische Thesen zum Korper dargestellt, um das reziproke Verhaltnis zwischen diesem und den sozialen Gegebenheiten darzulegen. Im Anschluss daran werden Diskurse unterschiedlicher Wissensdisziplinen kritisch betrachtet, die im Laufe der Geschichte zur Konstruktion und sozialen Inszenierung einer √¢‚Ç¨≈ìidealen Weiblichkeit"" beigetragen haben, wobei hier der Fokus auf der zentralen Rolle des Frauenkorpers als Austragungsort von Einschreibungstendenzen liegt. Nach einem Verortungsversuch des weitlaufigen Begriffes Subversion als Sichtbarmachung von gesellschaftlichen Normen wird der Frage nachgegangen, inwiefern die Darstellung des Korpers als subversives Ausdrucksmittel fungieren kann. 
In der Analyse des Primartextes wird herausgearbeitet, wie Charlotte Roche mit dem Stilmittel des konsequenten Tabubruchs sowie der haufigen textimmanenten Verweise auf Groteskes und Ekelassoziationen die am Korper manifest werdenden Diskursivierungen von √¢‚Ç¨≈æWeiblichkeit√¢‚Ç¨≈ì wie Schonheit, Schamempfinden und Reinheit untergrabt. Es wird gezeigt, wie durch den Einsatz von visuellen Textelementen die voyeuristische Blickstruktur aufgebrochen und dadurch herkommliche visuelle Reprasentationsmechanismen von Weiblichkeitsbildern dekonstruiert und subvertiert werden. Den Abschluss der Textanalyse bildet die Hinterfragung des im Text prasentierten Konzepts von Sexualitat. Anhand der Ergebnisse der Textanalyse wird am Ende dieser Arbeit die Frage erortert, inwiefern die im untersuchten Text prasentierte Korperkonzeption im Sinne einer weiblichen Selbstermachtigung gelesen werden kann und sich Feuchtgebiete letztendlich als subversiver Text festmachen lasst.",2010,
Zielgerichtete Arzneiformen bei Entz√É¬ºndungen,"Zur Therapie von Entzundungen des Endothels stellt das Glukokortikoid Triamcinolonacetonid einen geeigneten Wirkstoff dar. Um nun diesen Wirkstoff zielgerichtet an den Wirkort zu transportieren und dadurch die Wirkung zu erhohen oder zu verlangern und gleichzeitig die Nebenwirkungen gering zu halten, wird TAAc in Mikropartikel eingebaut. 
Durch vielfaltige Variation der Herstellungsparameter ist es schlieslich gelungen, biodegradierbare PLGA-Mikropartikel mit einem Durchmesser von 1,5 √Ç¬µm herzustellen, die zu 25% aus Wirkstoff und zu 75% aus Polymer bestehen bei einer Einbaurate von ca. 34%. Sowohl die Grose als auch die Oberflachenbeschaffenheit der Mikropartikel konnte zusatzlich durch Elektronenmikroskopie bestatigt werden. 
Um die Interaktion von kortikoidbeladenen Mikropartikeln mit entzundetem Gewebe ex-vivo charakterisieren zu konnen, sollte ein Endothelzell-Modell entwickelt werden. Die Kultivierung von Zellmonolayern der immortalisierten Endothelzelllinien HUVECtert und HMEC, sowie von primaren Endothelzellen (HUVEC) gelang nach Fibronektinbeschichtung sowohl im flexiPERM micro 12 System als auch in PDMS-Kanalen. Durch Behandlung mit TNF-√é¬± konnte bei HUVECtert und HUVEC eine Entzundung induziert werden, die sowohl qualitativ mikroskopisch nach Immunfluoreszenzfarbung von exprimiertem E-Selectin als auch quantitativ in Suspensionskulturen flowcytometrisch nachgewiesen wurden. Im Gegensatz dazu konnte bei HMEC keine Entzundung induziert werden. Insgesamt konnten bei primaren Endothelzellen mehr Zellen bei hoherer Viabilitat entzundet werden als bei HUVECtert. 
Diese positiven Nachweise der Entzundung dienten als Basis fur die Weiterentwicklung des Konzeptes des E-Selektin-Targetings. Dieses Protein wird bei Entzundung von Endothelzellen exprimiert bzw. auch sezerniert und besitzt als spezifischen Liganden das Oligosaccharid Sialyl Lewis X. Zum Nachweis der Target-Liganden-Interaktion wurde biotinylierter Sialyl Lewis X mit entzundeten HUVECtert und HUVEC inkubiert und mit fluoreszenzmarkiertem Avidin detektiert. Die mittels Flowcytometer quantifizierte hohere mittlere zellassoziierte Fluoreszenzintensitat bestatigt, dass die Bindung von Sialyl Lewis X an E-Selectin von entzundeten Endothelzellen und deren Detektion uber eine Biotin-Avidin Bindung prinzipiell erfolgreich war und der √¢‚Ç¨≈æproof-of-concept√¢‚Ç¨≈ì gelungen ist. 
Ein weiterfuhrenden Arbeiten vorbehaltenes Thema stellt die stark reduzierte Zahl an viabilen Zellen nach Induktion der Entzundung dar. Entgegen den physiologischen Gegebenheiten wurden die Endothelzellen aufgrund der vorhandenen apparativen Moglichkeiten in Suspension untersucht, was per se zu einer Einschrankung der Viabilitat fuhren konnte. Zusatzlich wurde ungereinigtes Biotinyl-Sialyl Lewis X eingesetzt, das noch Reste der moglicherweise toxischen Kopplungsreagentien enthielt. Daher sollten weiterfuhrende Untersuchungen an Zellmonolayern, beispielsweise in 96well-Platten mit Oberflachenbeschichtung durchgefuhrt werden und chromatographisch gereinigter Ligand eingesetzt werden.",2013,
A lightweight decentralized algorithm for jointly sparse optimization,"This paper develops a lightweight decentralized algorithm to solve the convex jointly sparse optimization problem, as known as the group lasso. In a networked multi-agent system, each agent takes linear measurements from its signal, and all signals share the same sparsity pattern. In decentralized jointly sparse optimization, agents collaborate to recover their signals by taking advantage of the same sparsity pattern, but they are allowed to have limited information exchange with their one-hop neighbors. We propose to use the block coordinate descent algorithm to solve the convex jointly sparse optimization problem in a centralized manner, and adopt an inexact average consensus technique for its decentralized implementation. The proposed decentralized algorithm is lightweight; each agent neither exchanges its measurement matrix and measurement vector nor shares its current estimate of its signal with its one-hop neighbors. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, as well as its empirical global convergence to the centralized optimal solution.",2013,Proceedings of the 32nd Chinese Control Conference
Low temperature tolerance of the Antarctic species Deschampsia antarctica: a complex metabolic response associated with nutrient remobilization.,"The species Deschampsia antarctica (DA) is one of the only two native vascular species that live in Antarctica. We performed ecophysiological, biochemical and metabolomic studies to investigate the responses of DA to low temperature. In parallel, we assessed the responses in a non-Antarctic reference species (Triticum aestivum, TA) from the same family (Poaceae). At low temperature (4√Ç¬∞C), both species showed lower photosynthetic rates (reductions were 70 and 80% for DA and TA, respectively) and symptoms of oxidative stress, but opposite responses of antioxidant enzymes (peroxidases and catalase). We employed fused LASSO statistical modelling to associate the species-dependent physiological and antioxidant responses to primary metabolism. Model results for DA indicated associations with osmoprotection, cell wall remodelling, membrane stabilization and antioxidant secondary metabolism (synthesis of flavonols and phenylpropanoids), coordinated with nutrient mobilization from source-to-sink tissues (confirmed by elemental analysis), which were not observed in TA. The metabolic behaviour of DA, with significant changes in particular metabolites, was compared with a newly compiled multi-species dataset showing a general accumulation of metabolites in response to low temperatures. Altogether, the responses displayed by DA suggest a compromise between catabolism and maintenance of leaf functionality. This article is protected by copyright.

Meaning and (F)act: Ray Brassier√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Speculative Nihilism and its Implications for Dialectics,"This paper seeks to frame the proper place for the empirical phenomenon of human meaning in the scientifically disenchanted world described by Ray Brassier. I embrace Brassier√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s statement that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNihilism is not an existential quandary but a speculative opportunity√¢‚Ç¨¬ù but disagree with his injunction that human meaning is unimportant. Meaning should be an object of philosophy insofar as we are biologically bound to experiencing the world in a meaningful way. Brassier√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s work is exciting for its application of rigorous analytic techniques to continental discourse, in a manner that makes contributions to both metaphysics and philosophy of science. Philosophers would do well do desist from issuing any further injunctions to re-establish the meaningfulness of existence, the purposefulness of life, or mend the shattered concord between man and nature. Philosophy should be more than a sop to the pathetic twinge of human self-esteem. Nihilism is not an existential quandary but a speculative opportunity. (Ray Brassier, Nihil Unbound: Enlightenment and Extinction(xi)) The recent work of Ray Brassier presents a fundamental challenge to the accepted ways in which philosophy has been performed in the past century. By using the technical precision of the analytic tradition to confront the giants of continental thought, he is able to begin a conversation many would think impossible. Seeing a complementary tendency between recent French materialism and radical Naturalism (particularly the Churchill√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s eliminative materialism), Brassier has opened a new trajectory that could lead to a productive reexamination of the aims of philosophy in the twenty first century. Nihil Unbound calls for a new scientific nihilism to break the trend of anthropocentric relativism that he sees as the still dominant doxa in almost all philosophy. Brassier insists that we have still not lent the proper attention the challenges that science raises. Over the course of a few centuries, the longstanding assumption that everything exists for a reason, that things are intrinsically purposeful and have been designed in accordance with a divine plan, is slowly but systematically dismantled, first in physics, then in chemistry, and eventually in biology, where it had held out longest. Curved space-time, the periodic table, natural selection: none of these are comprehensible in narrative terms. Galaxies, molecules, and organisms are not for anything. Try as we might, it becomes increasingly difficult to construct a rationally plausible narrative about the world that satisfies our psychological need for stories that unfold from beginning, through crisis, to ultimate resolution (Brassier-Interview). Res Cogitans (2012) 3:1 Wales | 88 2155-4838 | commons.pacificu.edu/rescogitans Brassier asserts that philosophy√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s response to this challenge has largely been a kneejerk attempt to reassert the meaning of human existence, rather than confronting the much more important and interesting challenge of a world without meaning as described by science. Some philosophers, particularly those of a continental bent, will be put off by this seemingly na√É¬Øve statement. One could imagine our interlocutor√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s line of reasoning: √¢‚Ç¨ÀúWhy are you giving science such little scrutiny? Any scientific claim can only be made from a human perspective and therefore is subject to the limitations of the given human narrative in which it exists.√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ This position which, following Quinton Meillassoux, Brassier calls √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcorrelationism√¢‚Ç¨¬ù assumes that it is impossible for humans to think a world without human thought. In Brassier√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s attempt to strengthen Meillassoux√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s argument against the correlation he brings to the table a hyper-existentialist argument that he claims can resolve the issue, the absolute certainty of human extinction. Rather than this taking the form of a new being-towards-death which can only lead to a realization of the authentic constitution of the human qua human, Brassier means this as a supremely inhuman gesture. The difference lies in concept of world. Brassier quotes Heidegger √¢‚Ç¨≈ìStrictly speaking we cannot say: there was a time when there were no human beings. At every time, there were and are human beings, because time temporalizes itself only as long as there are human beings√¢‚Ç¨¬ù (Heidegger, 889). At the acknowledged risk of being overly simplistic the argument is the same as that attributed to our hypothetical correlationist. Brassier, again following Meillassoux, posits that Correlationism is a stage that must be passed through in order to move forward. The interesting point is rather I see as the disjunct between Heidegger√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s brilliant understanding of historicity and this position. A Doxic Heideggarian would argue that due to the fact of historicity, thought that seeks to place itself outside of its historical place falls victim to transcendental fallacy. My retort to this is a simple reversal. The position that defies historicity is that which indexes existence in its totality to human experience. Take any number of scientific studies that demonstrate the fact of eventual human extinction, such as Brassier√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s absolute example of the death of the sun. While one could say that such a happening is solely dependent on constructs of human thought (systems of mathematics, measurements, theories, etc.) and as such that this scenario simply proves the correlation, this argument would not change the fact that scientists can accurately predict the lifespan of stars, therefore doing nothing to change the status of knowledge of such an event. Rather than destroying the manifest image of human life and replace it with the scientific image, I will contend that Brassier√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s brash challenge opens the doors to new possibilities in dialectics. Consider the following quote. Science does not need to deny the significance of our evident psychological need for narrative; it just demotes it from its previously foundational metaphysical status to that of an epistemically derivative √¢‚Ç¨Àúuseful fiction√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ ... I think that it is possible to understand the meaninglessness of existence, and that this capacity to understand meaning as a regional or bounded phenomenon marks a fundamental progress in cognition. (Brassier-Interview) This statement opens a new and interesting problem: How is a nihilist to conceive of meaning in his own experience? How, given that √¢‚Ç¨Àúexistence is worthless√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ did Brassier become a philosopher? Brassier has carefully separated his definitions of meaning and truth so as to avoid what he sees as Nietzsche√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s failure of conflating the lack of meaning with the lack of truth. While I agree with this criticism, it seems as if Brassier still misses an important point concerning the relation of the two terms insofar as he holds Res Cogitans (2012) 3:1 Wales | 89 2155-4838 | commons.pacificu.edu/rescogitans that he can perfectly separate and even oppose them to one another. In what follows I hope to hold Brassier accountable to his innovations by examining meaning as an empirical phenomena that must be examined by speculative thought. That is, while meaning is indeed a √¢‚Ç¨Àúbound phenomena√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ that is inarguably reducible to biological processes, this fact does not erase the truth of its existence. This point makes all the difference because it holds Brassier accountable for his own thought. Brassier√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s brilliance lies in his reinauguration of wonder (at extinction, science and truth) as the new opening condition of philosophy. This paper will not seek to reinstate human meaning as the centerpiece of philosophical truth but to understand √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbound meaning√¢‚Ç¨¬ù or meaning that is understood as objectively subjective. While meaning and truth are by no means identical, Brassier√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s declared love of truth in this pointless world must strike those who take him seriously as particularly significant. In order to fully appreciate Brassier√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s development, we must see that empirically verifiable statements have a radical new meaning within this framework. Rather than being ontologically identical to any statement, those that hit upon the material workings of the world in a mathematically predictable way have a retroactively transformative nature, which I will highlight by referring to them as F(acts). F(acts) can happen in a variety of ways, but they must be bits of data that cannot be accounted for in the world in which they emerge. Take the agricultural revolution, where the discovery that plants can be strategically planted en mass causes a defining acceleration of human development. The importance of this moment is foundational. What it entails is a transformational negation of the previous conditions of life that formerly conditioned existence for humans. What is at stake in this moment is nothing less than the foundational break in reality entailed here. This is a moment when a thing happens that breaks the rules of the world, as established by its prior state. What is now necessary is to establish precisely how the correlation is broken when a F(act) happens. By treating bound human meaning as being conditioned by F(acts) we can adequately discuss meaning in all of its importance without falling back into the correlation. Now we must delve into what exactly what the definition of √¢‚Ç¨Àúmeaning√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ is so that we may engage with it and its preconditions. Brassier, oddly enough, declines to define the term explicitly. However, by taking his juxtapositions of meaning and truth alongside those of the √¢‚Ç¨Àúmanifest image√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ and √¢‚Ç¨Àúscientific image√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ we can reasonably deduce what this signifies: the √¢‚Ç¨Àúje ne se quoi√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ of experience that is supposedly irreducible to the facts of existence and grounds the dimension of the human. Above I claimed that the human experience of meaning is an empirically verified phenomenon. By this I mean that it has been sufficiently demonstrated that any theory of human action can only make sense a citing a faculty that produces rational reasons in excess of the facts. Take, for example, the well-known Forer effect. In one elegan",2019,
"Departament dAgricultura a Zimbabwe (1897-1914): Febleses, conflictes i contradiccions en la construcci√É¬≥ de lEstat colonial, El","Una part significativa de la historiografia sobre lAfrica colonial ha defensat la visio dun Estat fort, coherent en les seves politiques i dedicat essencialment a impulsar lexplotacio economica dels diferents territoris, en benefici del capital privat. Davant daixo, les poblacions africanes es trobaven sotmeses i indefenses. Per contra, i en linia amb les tendencies duna part de la historiografia mes recent, la nostra tesi pretenia questionar certs elements de la visio de lAfrica colonial esmentada anteriorment, i fer-ho a traves de lestudi duna institucio estatal dedicada al recolzament dun sector economic dominat pels colons: el Departament dAgricultura a Zimbabwe, entre els anys 1897 i 1914, quan el pais es trobava sota ladministracio duna companyia privada, la British South Africa Company (BSAC).
El nostre estudi mostra com, efectivament, la BSAC i ladministracio a Zimbabwe van apostar de forma creixent per limpuls de lagricultura i la ramaderia en mans de colons blancs, els van oferir terres a preus baixos i ajuts publics de tot tipus, van expropiar i expulsar dels seus terrenys les poblacions africanes, van intentar pressionar els africans per tal que treballessin a les granges europees en condicions salarials i laborals deficients i esperaven incorporar la poblacio africana a leconomia moderna. Pero, al mateix temps, sha pogut observar como lEstat colonial mostrava una mancanca de recursos economics i de personal que limpedia traslladar a la practica determinades decisions teoriques. Com lautoritat politica es trobava dividida en les seves intencions i objetius: els ministeris a Londres desitjaven mantenir lestabilitat politica i, en part per aquesta rao, limitar les pressions i abusos sobre les poblacions africanes; la BSAC i part de ladministracio local prioritzaven els interessos miners davant dels grangers; els funcionaris encarregats de ladministracio de les poblacions africanes eren reticents a aplicar certes mesures agressives, com ara les expulsions de les granges, el control del bestiar, el treball forcat o la restriccio de lus dels recursos forestals o faunistics, i defensaven el manteniment, al menys parcial, de les institucions tradicionals africanes. Els colons tampoc formaven un grup monolitic al qual el govern pogues recolzar de forma generica. Per raons de procedencia etnica o social, i per interessos economics (miners, grangers, comerciants, propietaris dempreses, etc), els europeus buscaven i proposaven mesures contradictories. Tot aixo, combinat amb la resistencia davant les mesures aprovades, va permetre els africans conservar part de la seva autonomia i va provocar que els efectes de les politiques colonials fossin diversos: junt amb la perdua de terres en alguns casos es va produir un augment de les produccions agraries i dels ramats de bestiar, junt amb el treball mal remunerat es donaven casos dincentius pera la contractacio i un augment de lacumulacio i el consum gracies als salaris, etc.
Una analisi comparativa daltres casos i estudis sobre territoris colonials en els mateixos anys ens permet assegurar que Zimbabwe no constitueix una excepcio, sino que mes aviat sinclou dins dun panorama general dun Estat colonial amb febleses evidents i dividit en les seves intencions, que s enfrontava a uns grups de pressio europeus que formulaven peticions conflictives i a unes poblacions africanes amb una capacitat de resistencia i dautonomia en la participacio en leconomia i la societat colonials que han estat sovint minimitzades. Sobretot, es posa en evidencia una contradiccio inherent en la construccio de lEstat colonial daquest periode, especialment en els territoris britanics: la recerca dun objectiu economic lexplotacio dels recursos de les colonies al costat dun de politic, la perpetuacio de lexistencia del mateix poder colonial a traves del manteniment de lestabilitat social i de lassoliment duna certa legitimitat davant les poblacions africanes. La consciencia clara daquesta dualitat en els objetius i les politiques colonials ens permet entendre molt millor les decisions preses i els seus efectes sobre la poblacio africana.
"" SUMMARY:
Historiography on Colonial Africa has tended to defend the vision of the Colonial State as a powerful institution, coherent in its policies and basically devoted to the economic exploitation of the different territories on behalf of private capital. Under this kind of rule, African populations were passive and defenceless. Contrary to this view, our thesis aimed at questioning some of these interpretations through the analysis of an institution designed to support an economic sector dominated by white settlers: the Department of Agriculture in Zimbabwe between 1897 and 1914, when the country was under the administration of a private company, the British South Africa Company (BSAC).
Our research shows that the BSAC and its administration in Zimbabwe actually wished to encourage European agriculture and ranching. Settlers received cheap land and state subsidies, Africans suffered the expropriation of their lands, the State attempted to coerce Africans into the farm labour market, and officials expected to incorporate them into the modern economy. At the same time, though, we can see that the Colonial State suffered from a lack of funds and personnel, and that political authority was divided in its objectives: London ministries wished to maintain political stability and, partly for this reason, to limit the pressures applied on African populations; the BSAC and part of the local administration supported mining interests in front of the farmers; government officials were reluctant to impose some aggressive policies such as expulsions of tenants from farms, livestock controls, forced labour or restrictions over the African use of forests and wildlife, and defended, at least partially, African traditional institutions. White settlers were not a monolithic group either, they were divided according to their social or national origin and to their economic interests (farmers, miners, traders). They wished to achieve objectives that were often conflictive. All this, combined with their resistance to colonial policies, allowed Africans to maintain part of their autonomy.
A comparative analysis of other colonial territories in the same period allows us to say that Zimbabwe was not an exception. It was part of a general situation in which the Colonial State was weak and divided in its objectives and was facing European pressure groups with contradictory demands and African populations with a relatively strong capacity to resist colonial policies or to adapt them to their interests. Above all, we can see an inherent contradiction within the State: the search for an economic objective the exploitation of the colonies resources was often in contradiction with the achievement of a political goal: the perpetuation of colonial power itself through the maintenance of political stability and a certain degree of legitimacy in the eyes of the African population.
