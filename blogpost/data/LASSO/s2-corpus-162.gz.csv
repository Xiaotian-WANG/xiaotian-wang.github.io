Random forest Granger causality for detection of effective brain connectivity using high-dimensional data.,"Studies have shown that the brain functions are not localized to isolated areas and connections but rather depend on the intricate network of connections and regions inside the brain. These networks are commonly analyzed using Granger causality (GC) that utilizes the ordinary least squares (OLS) method for its standard implementation. In the past, several approaches have shown to solve the limitations of OLS by using diverse regularization systems. However, there are still some shortcomings in terms of accuracy, precision, and false discovery rate (FDR). In this paper, we are proposing a new strategy to use Random Forest as a regularization technique for computing GC that will improve these shortcomings. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methodology by comparing the results with existing Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Elastic-Net regularized implementations of GC using simulated dataset. Later, we have used our proposed approach to map the network involved during deductive reasoning using real StarPlus dataset.",2016,Journal of integrative neuroscience
Stress and Self-Efficacy as Long-Term Predictors for Chronic Low Back Pain: A Prospective Longitudinal Study,"Purpose
Psychosocial variables are known risk factors for the development and chronification of low back pain (LBP). Psychosocial stress is one of these risk factors. Therefore, this study aims to identify the most important types of stress predicting LBP. Self-efficacy was included as a potential protective factor related to both, stress and pain.


Participants and Methods
This prospective observational study assessed n = 1071 subjects with low back pain over 2 years. Psychosocial stress was evaluated in a broad manner using instruments assessing perceived stress, stress experiences in work and social contexts, vital exhaustion and life-event stress. Further, self-efficacy and pain (characteristic pain intensity and disability) were assessed. Using least absolute shrinkage selection operator regression, important predictors of characteristic pain intensity and pain-related disability at 1-year and 2-years follow-up were analyzed.


Results
The final sample for the statistic procedure consisted of 588 subjects (age: 39.2 (Â±13.4) years; baseline pain intensity: 27.8 (Â±18.4); disability: 14.3 (Â±17.9)). In the 1-year follow-up, the stress types ""tendency to worry"", ""social isolation"", ""work discontent"" as well as vital exhaustion and negative life events were identified as risk factors for both pain intensity and pain-related disability. Within the 2-years follow-up, Lasso models identified the stress types ""tendency to worry"", ""social isolation"", ""social conflicts"", and ""perceived long-term stress"" as potential risk factors for both pain intensity and disability. Furthermore, ""self-efficacy"" (""internality"", ""self-concept"") and ""social externality"" play a role in reducing pain-related disability.


Conclusion
Stress experiences in social and work-related contexts were identified as important risk factors for LBP 1 or 2 years in the future, even in subjects with low initial pain levels. Self-efficacy turned out to be a protective factor for pain development, especially in the long-term follow-up. Results suggest a differentiation of stress types in addressing psychosocial factors in research, prevention and therapy approaches.",2020,Journal of Pain Research
Fault Relevant Variable Selection for Fault Diagnosis,"In process monitoring, fault relevant variable selection and fault diagnosis are two important branches. But they are often discussed independently and scarcely integrated in research. To integrate them, a novel fault diagnosis algorithm based on fault relevant variable selection is proposed in this paper. The main contents are summarized as follows. For fault relevant variable selection, from normal state to fault state, the relative changes between variables and statistics are analyzed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). In order to determine the optimal set of fault relevant variable, a fault reconstruction algorithm based on least angle regression (LARS) is proposed. The set of relevant variables is constantly updated until there is no abnormality after reconstruction. Finally, a monitoring strategy based on fault subspace is proposed. It can detect fault effectively and provide useful information for fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by some experiments.",2020,IEEE Access
The DNA methylation profile of non-coding RNAs improves prognosis prediction for pancreatic adenocarcinoma,"BackgroundCompelling lines of evidence indicate that DNA methylation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) plays critical roles in various tumour progression. In addition, the differential methylation of ncRNAs can predict prognosis of patients. However, little is known about the clear relationship between DNA methylation profile of ncRNAs and the prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) patients.MethodsThe data of DNA methylation, RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and clinical features of PAC patients were collected from TCGA database. The DNA methylation profile was obtained using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. LASSO regression was performed to construct two methylation-based classifiers. The risk score of methylation-based classifiers was calculated for each patient, and the accuracy of the classifiers in predicting overall survival (OS) was examined by ROC curve analysis. In addition, Cox regression models were utilized to assess whether clinical variables and the classifiers were independent prognostic factors for OS. The targets of miRNA and the genes co-expressed with lncRNA were identified with DIANA microT-CDS and the Multi-Experiment Matrix (MEM), respectively. Moreover, DAVID Bioinformatics Resources were applied to analyse the functional enrichment of these targets and co-expressed genes.ResultsA total of 4004 CpG sites of miRNA and 11,259 CpG sites of lncRNA were screened. Among these CpG sites, 8 CpG sites of miRNA and 7 CpG sites of lncRNA were found with regression coefficients. By multiplying the sum of methylation degrees of the selected CpGs with these coefficients, two methylation-based classifiers were constructed. The classifiers have shown good performance in predicting the survival rate of PAC patients at varying follow-up times. Interestingly, both of these two classifiers were predominant and independent factors for OS. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that aberrantly methylated miRNAs and lncRNAs are related to calcium ion transmembrane transport and MAPK, Ras and calcium signalling pathways.ConclusionIn the present study, we identified two methylation-based classifiers of ncRNA associated with OS in PAC patients through a comprehensive analysis of miRNA and lncRNA profiles. We are the first group to demonstrate a relationship between the aberrant DNA methylation of ncRNAs and the prognosis of PAC, and this relationship would contribute to individualized PAC therapy.",2019,Cancer Cell International
Survival Prediction in High-grade Osteosarcoma Using Radiomics of Diagnostic Computed Tomography,"The poor 5-year survival rate in high-grade osteosarcoma (HOS) has not been increased significantly over the past 30â€¯years. This work aimed to develop a radiomics nomogram for survival prediction at the time of diagnosis in HOS. In this retrospective study, an initial cohort of 102 HOS patients, diagnosed from January 2008 to March 2011, was used as the training cohort. Radiomics features were extracted from the pretreatment diagnostic computed tomography images. A radiomics signature was constructed with the lasso algorithm; then, a radiomics score was calculated to reflect survival probability by using the radiomics signature for each patient. A radiomics nomogram was developed by incorporating the radiomics score and clinical factors. A clinical model was constructed by using clinical factors only. The models were validated in an independent cohort comprising 48 patients diagnosed from April 2011 to April 2012. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to its calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. The radiomics nomogram showed better calibration and classification capacity than the clinical model with AUC 0.86 vs. 0.79 for the training cohort, and 0.84 vs. 0.73 for the validation cohort. Decision curve analysis demonstrated the clinical usefulness of the radiomics nomogram. A significant difference (p-value <.05; log-rank test) was observed between the survival curves of the nomogram-predicted survival and non-survival groups. The radiomics nomogram may assist clinicians in tailoring appropriate therapy.",2018,EBioMedicine
"Effects of intercropping sorghum-cowpea on natural enemies of the sorghum shoot fly, Atherigona soccata (Diptera: Muscidae), in Burkina Faso.","Experiments were conducted in 1990 and 1991 at Matourkou near Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso (West Africa), to study the effect of intercropping sorghum-cowpea, Sorghum bicolor L. (Moench)â€”Vigna unguiculata (Walp.), on the natural enemies of the sorghum shoot fly, Atherigona soccata Rondani (Diptera: Muscidae). Sampling was done weekly, on six occasions starting 10 days after sowing. Natural enemies of eggs were Trichogrammatoidea simmondsi Nagaraja (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatoidae), Tapinoma sp. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), Fusarium sp. and a bacterium, Corynebacterium sp. Other insect species included a thysanopteran (Phlaeothripidae, Haplothripinae) and Dicrodiphosis sp. (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) which were also associated with the sorghum shoot fly eggs. No significant differences were observed between the pure sorghum and the intercropped sorghum-cowpea with respect to T. simmondsi parasitism. Larval parasitoids were Neotrichoporoides nyemitawus Rohwer (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), (6 to 17.50% of parasitism...",1993,Biological Agriculture & Horticulture
Accuracy of direct genomic values derived from imputed single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes in Jersey cattle.,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the predictive ability of direct genomic values for economically important dairy traits when genotypes at some single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were imputed rather than measured directly. Genotypic data consisted of 42,552 SNP genotypes for each of 1,762 Jersey sires. Phenotypic data consisted of predicted transmitting abilities (PTA) for milk yield, protein percentage, and daughter pregnancy rate from May 2006 for 1,446 sires in the training set and from April 2009 for 316 sires in the testing set. The SNP effects were estimated using the Bayesian least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (LASSO) method with data of sires in the training set, and direct genomic values (DGV) for sires in the testing set were computed by multiplying these estimates by corresponding genotype dosages for sires in the testing set. The mean correlation across traits between DGV (before progeny testing) and PTA (after progeny testing) for sires in the testing set was 70.6% when all 42,552 SNP genotypes were used. When genotypes for 93.1, 96.6, 98.3, or 99.1% of loci were masked and subsequently imputed in the testing set, mean correlations across traits between DGV and PTA were 68.5, 64.8, 54.8, or 43.5%, respectively. When genotypes were also masked and imputed for a random 50% of sires in the training set, mean correlations across traits between DGV and PTA were 65.7, 63.2, 53.9, or 49.5%, respectively. Results of this study indicate that if a suitable reference population with high-density genotypes is available, a low-density chip comprising 3,000 equally spaced SNP may provide approximately 95% of the predictive ability observed with the BovineSNP50 Beadchip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) in Jersey cattle. However, if fewer than 1,500 SNP are genotyped, the accuracy of DGV may be limited by errors in the imputed genotypes of selection candidates.",2010,Journal of dairy science
Super-resolution DOA Estimation for Arbitrary Array Geometries Using a Single Noisy Snapshot,"We address the problem of search-free DOA estimation from a single noisy snapshot for sensor arrays of arbitrary geometry, by extending a method of gridless super-resolution beam-forming to arbitrary arrays with noisy measurements. The primal atomic norm minimization problem is converted to a dual problem in which the periodic dual function is represented with a trigonometric polynomial using truncated Fourier series. The number of terms required for accurate representation depends linearly on the distance of the farthest sensor from a reference. The dual problem is then expressed as a semidefinite program and solved in polynomial time. DOA estimates are obtained via polynomial rooting followed by a LASSO based approach to remove extraneous roots arising in root finding from noisy data, and then source amplitudes are recovered by least squares. Simulations using circular and random planar arrays show high resolution DOA estimation in white and colored noise scenarios.",2019,"ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)"
Ridge and Lasso Performance in Spatial Data with Heterogeneity and Multicollinearity,"Spatial heterogeneity becomes a separate issue on the analysis of spatial data. GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) is a statistical technique to explore spatial nonstationarity by form the differrent regression models at different point in observation space. Multicollinearity is a condition that the independent variables in model have linear relationship. It would be a problem for estimation parameters process, because that condition produces unstable model. This problem may be found in GWR models, which allow the linear relationship between independent variables at each location called local multicollinearity. GWRR (Geographically Weighted Ridge Regression) and GWL (Geographically Weighted Lasso) which use the concept of ridge and lasso is shrink the regression coefficient in GWR model. GWRR and GWL techniques are consider to be capable of overcoming local multicollinearity to produce more stable models with lower variance. In this study, GWRR and GWL is used to model Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) in Java using kernel exponential weighted function. The results showed that GWL has better performance to predict GRDP with lower RMSE and higher value than GWRR. Keyword : Spatial Heterogeneity, GWR, Local Multicollinearity, Ridge, Lasso",2015,
Transplantation: The molecular landscape of ABMR,"Antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) is characterized by molecular changes that indicate a role for injuryâ€“repair mechanisms in the microcirculation that are likely mediated by natural killer (NK) cell signalling through CD16a Fc receptors, according to new findings. â€œOur study mapped the molecular landscape associated with ABMR of kidney transplants,â€ explains researcher Philip Halloran. â€œWe identified a phenotype driven by microcirculation remodelling with a serious role for NK cells. IFN-Î³ also seems important, with strong associations of the IFN-Î³-inducible molecules PLA1A and CXCL11 with ABMR.â€ ABMR is a major cause of graft loss in kidney transplant recipients. Type 2 ABMR, which emerges after the first year of transplantation, is a microcirculation disease and is the leading cause of kidney transplant failure. â€œThe process of ABMR is difficult to model in animal systems,â€ says Halloran. â€œWe therefore performed microarray analysis to map transcripts associated with ABMR in indication biopsy samples taken between 3 days and 35 years after renal transplantation.â€ Transcript analysis of 403 biopsy samples from 315 patients in a discovery set identified a set of 30 transcripts that were associated with ABMR. These transcripts were conserved in a second independent validation set of 300 biopsy samples from 264 patients. â€œThe signal is highly reproducible, demonstrating that the molecular phenotype is just as robust as the histological phenotype,â€ notes Halloran. Analysis of the transcripts revealed three main categories: endothelial transcripts, including cadherins; NK cellassociated transcripts; and genes that are regulated by IFN-Î³. The researchers performed pathway analyses to assess the potential mechanisms associated with the transcript changes. â€œThe most characteristic pathway was endothelial remodelling related to pathways involved in microcirculation and angiopoietin,â€ says Halloran. â€œWe also think that NK cells signal through CD16a to mediate antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity, which has effects on the endothelium.â€ The researchers say their goal is to use the quantitative study of molecules to identify ABMR and to guide therapy.",2015,Nature Reviews Nephrology
Tobacco alternatives in Greece. A preliminary evaluation and classification,"The CAP reform for the tobacco sector has the aim to phase out the subsidy payment for tobacco cultivation.

Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Methods for Genomic Selection of Traits with Additive and Epistatic Genetic Architectures,"Parametric and nonparametric methods have been developed for purposes of predicting phenotypes. These methods are based on retrospective analyses of empirical data consisting of genotypic and phenotypic scores. Recent reports have indicated that parametric methods are unable to predict phenotypes of traits with known epistatic genetic architectures. Herein, we review parametric methods including least squares regression, ridge regression, Bayesian ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Bayesian LASSO, best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes C, and Bayes CÏ€. We also review nonparametric methods including Nadaraya-Watson estimator, reproducing kernel Hilbert space, support vector machine regression, and neural networks. We assess the relative merits of these 14 methods in terms of accuracy and mean squared error (MSE) using simulated genetic architectures consisting of completely additive or two-way epistatic interactions in an F2 population derived from crosses of inbred lines. Each simulated genetic architecture explained either 30% or 70% of the phenotypic variability. The greatest impact on estimates of accuracy and MSE was due to genetic architecture. Parametric methods were unable to predict phenotypic values when the underlying genetic architecture was based entirely on epistasis. Parametric methods were slightly better than nonparametric methods for additive genetic architectures. Distinctions among parametric methods for additive genetic architectures were incremental. Heritability, i.e., proportion of phenotypic variability, had the second greatest impact on estimates of accuracy and MSE.",2014,G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics

ECG data optimization for biometric human recognition using statistical distributed machine learning algorithm,"Currently, security plays a crucial role in military, forensic and other industry applications. Traditional biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint, voice, face, iris and signature may not meet the demand for higher security. At present, the utility of biological signals in the area of security became popular. ECG signal is getting wide attention to use it as a tool for biometric recognition in authentication applications. ECG signals can provide more accurate biometrics for personal identity recognition. In machine learning, over-fitting is one of the major problems when working with a large data set of features so that an effective statistical technique is needed to control it. In this research, ECG signals are acquired from 20 individuals over 6 months in the MIT-BIH ECG-ID database. Altogether, a high-dimensional (Nâ€‰=â€‰72) set of ECG features are extracted. These features are further fed to an algorithm, which reduces the feature space by classifying vital features and avoiding random, correlated and over-fitted features to increase the prediction accuracy. In this paper, a new intelligent statistical learning method, namely least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), is proposed to select appropriate features for identification. The refined features thus obtained are trained with popular machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks, multi-class one-against-all support vector machine and K-nearest neighbour (K-NN). Finally, the performance of the proposed method with and without LASSO is compared using performance metrics. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed method of LASSO with K-NN classifier is effective with a recognition accuracy of 99.1379%.",2019,The Journal of Supercomputing

Sparse Weighted Canonical Correlation Analysis,"Given two data matrices $X$ and $Y$, sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) is to seek two sparse canonical vectors $u$ and $v$ to maximize the correlation between $Xu$ and $Yv$. However, classical and sparse CCA models consider the contribution of all the samples of data matrices and thus cannot identify an underlying specific subset of samples. To this end, we propose a novel sparse weighted canonical correlation analysis (SWCCA), where weights are used for regularizing different samples. We solve the $L_0$-regularized SWCCA ($L_0$-SWCCA) using an alternating iterative algorithm. We apply $L_0$-SWCCA to synthetic data and real-world data to demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority compared to related methods. Lastly, we consider also SWCCA with different penalties like LASSO (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and Group LASSO, and extend it for integrating more than three data matrices.",2017,ArXiv

Un balance no convencional de Correa en Ecuador,"Con mayoria legislativa y dos reelecciones presidenciales, Rafael Correa abrio en 2007 un ciclo politico desconocido hasta entonces en Ecuador. Su estilo carismatico, dosis de autoritarismo y el precio al alza de las materias primas dejan un legado de compleja evaluacion y futuro incerto. Apenas siete decimas han faltado al partido de gobierno, Alianza PAIS (AP), y a su candidato, Lenin Moreno, para vencer en una unica vuelta en las presidenciales de Ecuador del 19 de febrero. En vista de que ninguno de los candidatos obtuvo la mayoria absoluta, ni el 40% de votos y el 10% con respecto al segundo mejor clasificado, Ecuador celebrara el 2 de abril la segunda vuelta entre Moreno y el candidato de Creando Oportunidades (CREO), Guillermo Lasso, un empresario de banca en la derecha del espectro politico, con un programa centrado en el topico de la desregulacion economica, la reduccion del tamano del Estado y su capacidad interventora - desarrollada durante la Revolucion Ciudadana -, a lo que se suma una vision conservadora consecuente con su afinidad con el movimiento catolico Opus Dei. A falta de publicarse los datos oficiales al cierre de este articulo (27 febrero), se estima que AP logra 74 escanos de 137, lo que le daria la mayoria absoluta. Los otros partidos con representacion serian: CREO, 31; el Partido Socialista Cristiano (PSC), 15; Pachakutik (4); Izquierda Democratica (ID), 4; Partido Sociedad Patriotica (PSP), 3; Sociedad Unida Mas Accion (SUMA), 2; y Fuerza Ecuador (FE), 1. A estos se suman tres congresistas de movimientos provinciales. Esta configuracion de las mayorias legislativas hace prever que, de ganar el candidato de la oposicion, habra tension entre ejecutivo y legislativo en un contexto de necesarias reformas economicas. Ecuador ha vivido en permanente clima electoral durante los ultimos dos anos debido a los intentos de reforma de la Constitucion para permitir la reeleccion, posibilidad sobre la que el presidente, Rafael Correa, mantuvo posiciones ambiguas para finalmente desecharla. La oposicion busco alianzas para unificar candidaturas, pero solo los partidos de izquierda no afines a Correa la concretaron. Los candidatos de la derecha que acercaron posiciones (Lasso y Cynthia Viteri del PSC) obtuvieron en conjunto cerca del 42% de los votos, lo que les situa en buena posicion para la segunda vuelta. Las elecciones de 2017 han generado una reorganizacion de los partidos politicos y una expectativa de cambio de ciclo debido a la debilidad de la candidatura oficialista, que sirvio como incentivo para evitar una gran coalicion opositora a la manera de lo ocurrido en Venezuela. El final de un modelo Correa tiene una serie de logros de los que estar orgulloso como presidente: la transformacion de la infraestructura, el modelo energetico y el sistema educativo y de salud. Buscando un indicador que resuma el rendimiento del gobierno, la pobreza extrema, que afectaba en 2006 al 16,9% de la poblacion, se ha reducido al 8,7% en 2017. Estos logros no se podrian entender sin los ingresos recibidos por la bonanza de las materias primas, sobre todo por la habil renegociacion de los contratos petroleros realizada por el gobierno, que aumento la participacion del Estado (dueno del petroleo del subsuelo) en los beneficios de la explotacion hecha por empresas privadas. Los 10 anos de Correa han sido, en promedio, los de mayores ingresos economicos de la historia contemporanea de Ecuador. Ha sido casi una decada de un gobierno marcado por la fuerte personalidad y el estilo de gestion del presidente, lo que hace que el modelo de la Revolucion Ciudadana practicamente termine con su salida del gobierno. No solo eso: tambien llega a su fin un modelo de politicas publicas que no podra continuar debido a la falta de recursos economicos. En lo politico, el balance de Correa es mas discutible, pues a su indudable liderazgo y apoyo electoral hay que anadir, a lo largo de su mandato, elementos autoritarios como el enfrentamiento con la prensa - a la que el presidente acusa de hacer oposicion politica -, la represion de toda forma de protesta bajo la acusacion de fomentar la violencia y la desestabilizacion, asi como la persecucion a organizaciones indigenas y medioambientales, entre otras",2017,
Bayesian Masking: Sparse Bayesian Estimation with Weaker Shrinkage Bias,"A common strategy for sparse linear regression is to introduce regularization, which eliminates irrelevant features by letting the corresponding weights be zeros. However, regularization often shrinks the estimator for relevant features, which leads to incorrect feature selection. Motivated by the above-mentioned issue, we propose Bayesian masking (BM), a sparse estimation method which imposes no regularization on the weights. The key concept of BM is to introduce binary latent variables that randomly mask features. Estimating the masking rates determines the relevance of the features automatically. We derive a variational Bayesian inference algorithm that maximizes the lower bound of the factorized information criterion (FIC), which is a recently developed asymptotic criterion for evaluating the marginal log-likelihood. In addition, we propose reparametrization to accelerate the convergence of the derived algorithm. Finally, we show that BM outperforms Lasso and automatic relevance determination (ARD) in terms of the sparsity-shrinkage trade-off.",2015,ArXiv

Grouped variable selection in high dimensional partially linear additive Cox model,"In the analysis of survival outcome supplemented with both clinical information and high-dimensional gene expression data, traditional Cox proportional hazard model fails to meet some emerging needs in biological research. First, the number of covariates is generally much larger the sample size. Secondly, predicting an outcome with individual gene expressions is inadequate because a geneâ€™s expression is regulated by multiple biological processes and functional units. There is a need to understand the impact of changes at a higher level such as molecular function, cellular component, biological process, or pathway. The change at a higher level is usually measured with a set of gene expressions related to the biological process. That is, we need to model the outcome with gene sets as variable groups and the gene sets could be partially overlapped also. In this thesis work, we investigate the impact of a penalized Cox regression procedure on regularization, parameter estimation, variable group selection, and nonparametric modeling of nonlinear effects with a time-to-event outcome. We formulate the problem as a partially linear additive Cox model with high-dimensional data. We group genes into gene sets and approximate the nonparametric components by truncated series expansions with B-spline bases. After grouping and approximation, the problem of variable selection becomes that of selecting groups of coefficients in a gene set or in an approximation. We apply the group Lasso to obtain an initial solution path and reduce the dimension of",2018,
Risk management of coronary heart disease â€“ prevention,"SummaryCardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and is responsible for 45% of deaths in the western world and 24.5% of deaths in the developing countries. In the 21st century these diseases will continue to dominate the disease spectrum and death statistics in both the industrialised and developing worlds. Since 1975, mortality from cardiovascular disease has decreased by about 24 to 28% in most countries. About 45% of this reduction can be attributed to an improvement in treatment of coronary heart disease and around 55% are attributable to a reduction in risk factors, in particular, stopping smoking and control of hypertension. However, especially in the case of ischaemic heart disease, it is not clear whether the reduction in mortality reflects a reduction in incidence of this disease. Due to the aging population and the reduction in age-related mortality, it is expected that the absolute number of people with heart disease will increase. Furthermore, the increase in prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes, as well as the higher prevalence of female smokers compared with thirty years ago, could result in an increase in mortality over the next years and decades. It has been shown that prevention strategies, such as education campaigns aimed at the general public, can potentially greatly contribute to a reduction in incidence of cardiovascular disease at every stage. In order for such campaigns to be effective, it is necessary to understand and reduce the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A large proportion of these risk factors are associated with lifestyle and are therefore modifiable. These modifiable risk factors include smoking, hypertension, poor diet, dyslipidemia, lack of exercise, overweight, adiposity and diabetes mellitus and optimisation of these should be a key aim for all adults. Gender differences also play a role in the incidence and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Incidence of myocardial infarction in women increases significantly after the menopause, and mortality through coronary heart disease is higher amongst women than men. Hormonal status, use of oral contraceptives and pregnancy all influence risk for cardiovascular disease in women. Due to the enormity of the problem that cardiovascular disease presents to society and the great potential for management of risk factors for cardiovascular disease through preventive medicine, a number of health promotion and prevention programmes have been initiated by various national and global organisations. This paper presents an analysis of modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease together with a review of targeted prevention programmes aiming at reducing these risks.ZusammenfassungHerz-Kreislauferkrankungen zÃ¤hlen zu den hÃ¤ufigsten Todesursachen weltweit und sind in westlichen LÃ¤ndern fÃ¼r 45 % und in EntwicklungslÃ¤ndern fÃ¼r 24,5 % der GesamtmortalitÃ¤t verantwortlich. Im 21. Jahrhundert werden diese Erkrankungen weiterhin das Erkrankungsspektrum und die Todesursachenstatistik anfÃ¼hren, sowohl in den IndustrielÃ¤ndern als auch in den EntwicklungslÃ¤ndern. Seit 1975 sind die MortalitÃ¤tsraten fÃ¼r kardiovaskulÃ¤re Erkrankungen in den meisten LÃ¤ndern um 24 bis 28 % gesunken. Etwa 45 % dieser Reduktion sind der Verbesserung der Therapien fÃ¼r KHK zuzuschreiben, die restlichen 55 % werden der Reduktion der Risikofaktoren, vor allem dem RÃ¼ckgang des Rauchens und der Behandlung der Hypertonie zugeschrieben. Es ist jedoch, besonders bei den ischÃ¤mischen Herzerkrankungen, nicht klar, ob der RÃ¼ckgang der MortalitÃ¤t einen RÃ¼ckgang der Inzidenz widerspiegelt. Aufgrund der alternden BevÃ¶lkerung und der Reduktion in der altersspezifischen MortalitÃ¤t ist ein Anstieg in der absoluten Anzahl der Personen mit Herzkreislauferkrankungen anzunehmen. AuÃŸerdem kÃ¶nnte es durch die Zunahme der PrÃ¤valenz der Adipositas, des Metabolischen Syndroms und des Typ-II-Diabetes, wie auch durch die hÃ¶here PrÃ¤valenz der Raucherinnen im Vergleich mit der vor dreiÃŸig Jahren, in den nÃ¤chsten Jahren und Jahrezehnten wieder zu einem Anstieg der MortalitÃ¤t kommen. Der Entwicklung von Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen kann durch prÃ¤ventivmedizinische MaÃŸnahmen, wie GesundheitsfÃ¶rderungsprogramme fÃ¼r die BevÃ¶lkerung, in allen Stadien entgegengewirkt werden. FÃ¼r eine wirkungsvolle PrÃ¤vention von Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen ist es notwendig, die Risikofaktoren, die zu Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen fÃ¼hren, zu identifizieren und zu reduzieren. Ein GroÃŸteil dieser Risikofaktoren sind lebensstilassoziiert und sind modifizierbar. Diese modifizierbaren Risikofaktoren sind Rauchen, Hypertonie, ErnÃ¤hrung, DyslipidÃ¤mie, kÃ¶rperliche InaktivitÃ¤t, Ãœbergewicht, Adipositas und Diabetes mellitus und eine Optimierung des Lebensstils sollte deshalb bei allen Erwachsenen angestrebt werden. Geschlechtsspezifische Unterschiede kÃ¶nnen auch eine Rolle in der Inzidenz und PrÃ¤vention von Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen spielen. Bei Frauen steigt die Inzidenz von Myokardinfarkt signifikant nach der Menopause an. AuÃŸerdem ist die MortalitÃ¤t der KHK hÃ¶her als bei MÃ¤nnern. Hormonstatus, die Einnahme von oralen Kontrazeptiva und Schwangerschaft beeinflussen das Risiko fÃ¼r Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen bei Frauen. Aufgrund der enormen Probleme, die Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen fÃ¼r die BevÃ¶lkerung darstellen, und des groÃŸen Potentials im Risikomanagement der koronaren Herzkrankheit durch die PrÃ¤ventivmedizin wurden GesundheitsfÃ¶rderungs- und PrÃ¤ventionsprogramme eingesetzt. Dieser Bericht prÃ¤sentiert eine Analyse der modifizierbaren kardiovaskulÃ¤ren Risikofaktoren sowie einen Review der gezielten PrÃ¤ventionsprogramme, die die PrÃ¤valenz der Risikofaktoren fÃ¼r Herz-Kreislauferkrankungen durch Lebensstiloptimierung in der BevÃ¶lkerung reduzieren wollen.",2004,Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift
Identification of a six-lncRNA signature associated with recurrence of ovarian cancer,"Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is the leading cause of death among all gynecological malignancies, and recurrent OvCa is almost always incurable. In this study, we developed a signature based on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with OvCa recurrence to facilitate personalized OvCa therapy. lncRNA expression data were extracted from GSE9891 and GSE30161. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) penalized regression was used to identify an lncRNA-based signature using the GSE9891 training cohort. The signature was then validated in GSE9891 internal and GSE30161 external validation cohorts. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to explore the possible functions of identified lncRNAs. A six-lncRNA signature (RUNX1-IT1, MALAT1, H19, HOTAIRM1, LOC100190986 and AL132709.8) was identified in the training cohort and validated in internal and external validation cohorts using the LASSO method (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). This signature was also independent of other clinical factors according to multivariate and sub-group analyses. The identified lncRNAs are involved in cancer-related biological processes and pathways. We selected a highly reliable signature based on six lncRNAs associated with OvCa recurrence. This six-lncRNA signature is a promising method to personalize ovarian cancer therapy and may improve patient quality of life quality according to patientsâ€™ condition in the future.",2017,Scientific Reports
Sparse Laplacian Shrinkage with the Graphical Lasso Estimator for Regression Problems.,"This paper considers a high-dimensional linear regression problem where there are complex correlation structures among predictors. We propose a graph-constrained regularization procedure, named Sparse Laplacian Shrinkage with the Graphical Lasso Estimator (SLS-GLE). The procedure uses the estimated precision matrix to describe the specific information on the conditional dependence pattern among predictors, and encourages both sparsity on the regression model and the graphical model. We introduce the Laplacian quadratic penalty adopting the graph information, and give detailed discussions on the advantages of using the precision matrix to construct the Laplacian matrix. Theoretical properties and numerical comparisons are presented to show that the proposed method improves both model interpretability and accuracy of estimation. We also apply this method to a financial problem and prove that the proposed procedure is successful in assets selection.",2019,arXiv: Methodology
Metodologia d'indagine su un territorio montano e indicazioni per la salvaguardia del suo patrimonio - Il caso della Val Sangone,"La tesi si occupa di valutare vari aspetti degli insediamenti montani della Val Sangone, ragionando alle diverse scale di lettura cosi da permettere una conoscenza approfondita delle cause che stanno alla base del maggiore o minore grado di conservazione e di â€œvivacitaâ€ delle singole borgate, in modo da poter individuare, nello specifico, eventuali punti di forza su cui far leva, o punti di debolezza su cui intervenire. 
Si tratta in generale di realta fragili, differenti tra loro, ma caratterizzate tutte da un immenso bagaglio di valore storico, architettonico, artistico, culturale e sociale che, senza interventi adeguati, rischierebbe di andare perduto nel corso del tempo. Le dinamiche degli ultimi decenni, tra le quali il collasso dellâ€™economia montana tradizionale, hanno indotto lo spopolamento e lâ€™abbandono di tali aree in favore di una migrazione verso i centri urbani di fondovalle e la cintura torinese. Oggi giorno vi sono nuovi segnali che vertono verso progetti finalizzati al riabitare le aree montane e fermare un processo di abbandono ormai innescato. 
Nel caso della Val Sangone, la sua dimensione chiusa e contenuta ha permesso di effettuare un lavoro di conoscenza approfondito dello stato di fatto degli insediamenti rurali per poter individuare le cause che hanno portato allâ€™attuale situazione di parziale abbandono, nonche per innescare nuove ipotesi di ripopolamento e rifunzionalizzazione. Col fine di valorizzare quel territorio, sfruttandone le potenzialita, talvolta conservate o mitigate da una situazione di stallo o di abbandono, si e voluto innanzitutto procedere nel conoscere a fondo le realta diverse della valle. Pertanto, a seguito di una lettura generale del territorio e di una ricerca storica e documentativa preliminare che hanno permesso di comprendere la presenza di insediamenti costruiti allâ€™interno di un paesaggio ancora prevalentemente naturale, e stato condotto un censimento critico sistemico di tutti gli insediamenti presenti nei vari comuni in modo tale da avere un quadro completo ed esaustivo della situazione generale odierna. 
Per poter passare ad un successivo grado di dettaglio, la tesi ha elaborato un sistema di organizzazione del territorio, sulla base di quanto emerso precedentemente, al fine di individuare i casi su cui effettuare una schedatura di approfondimento. 
La tesi vuole essere uno strumento utile per chi volesse intervenire sul patrimonio architettonico rurale tipico della Val Sangone, fornendo precise linee guida di indagine per guidare interventi di recupero e conservazione del patrimonio storico valligiano, dalla scala territoriale a quella architettonica. Tali indagini evidenziano la necessita di rivitalizzare i nuclei conservandone presenze di valore della sua cultura e proponendo interventi integrati miranti al sostegno delle attivita, gia esercitate o da avviarsi, col fine di un miglioramento della qualita della vita in grado di favorire permanenza in loco della popolazione locale ed incentivando lâ€™insediamento di nuove imprenditorialita e nuclei familiari. 
Attraverso la rifunzionalizzazione di Borgata Rocco, individuata come fulcro nevralgico di un sistema di insediamenti capaci di rivitalizzare lâ€™alta valle, mediante il potenziamento di risorse gia presenti sul territorio ed il recupero e rifunzionalizzazione di spazi e manufatti attualmente non piu utilizzati, si e cercato di attuare un intervento di recupero sino alla scala architettonica. 
E' stato effettuato un progetto di restauro e di rifunzionalizzazione di una cellula finalizzato ad accogliere un museo della Resistenza partigiana, per conservare e diffondere la memoria storica di un fenomeno ben presente nella valle; un progetto esteso a coinvolgere funzionalmente l'intero nucleo, con la finalita di recuperarlo e rivitalizzarlo, conservandone i caratteri, complessivi e di dettaglio. 
La metodologia di rilievo adottata per individuare i legami tra il territorio naturale e quello antropizzato, nonche le dinamiche che legano fenomeni funzionali agli aspetti morfologici del presente e del passato, e stata utile per far comprendere i fenomeni che legano le varie parti costituenti quella valle e talvolta le motivazioni che hanno portato alla conservazione, o meno, dei singoli nuclei. Tale approccio d'indagine, sperimentato in questo caso su una valle che propone realta diversificate, e quindi talvolta difficilmente paragonabili, ha permesso di verificare un metodo di analisi attuabile ad altri casi, col fine di individuare quei caratteri che definiscono la fisionomia e la consistenza di ogni insediamento valligiano, utili e fondamentali elementi da riconoscere e segnalare per interventi di riqualificazione fondamentali da proporre per conservare un patrimonio che rischierebbe di essere annullato dal tempo.",2014,

On the Performance of Variable Selection and Classification via Rank-Based Classifier,"In high-dimensional gene expression data analysis, the accuracy and reliability of cancer classification and selection of important genes play a very crucial role. To identify these important genes and predict future outcomes (tumor vs. non-tumor), various methods have been proposed in the literature. But only few of them take into account correlation patterns and grouping effects among the genes. In this article, we propose a rank-based modification of the popular penalized logistic regression procedure based on a combination of l 1 and l 2 penalties capable of handling possible correlation among genes in different groups. While the l 1 penalty maintains sparsity, the l 2 penalty induces smoothness based on the information from the Laplacian matrix, which represents the correlation pattern among genes. We combined logistic regression with the BH-FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate) screening procedure and a newly developed rank-based selection method to come up with an optimal model retaining the important genes. Through simulation studies and real-world application to high-dimensional colon cancer gene expression data, we demonstrated that the proposed rank-based method outperforms such currently popular methods as lasso, adaptive lasso and elastic net when applied both to gene selection and classification.",2019,

Improving estimations in quantile regression model with autoregressive errors,"An important issue is that the respiratory mortality may be a result of air pollution which can be measured by the following variables: temperature, relative humidity, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrocarbons, ozone and particulates. The usual way is to fit a model using the ordinary least squares regression, which has some assumptions, also known as Gauss-Markov assumptions, on the error term showing white noise process of the regression model. However, in many applications, especially for this example, these assumptions are not satisfied. Therefore, in this study, a quantile regression approach is used to model the respiratory mortality using the mentioned explanatory variables. Moreover, improved estimation techniques such as preliminary testing and shrinkage strategies are also obtained when the errors are autoregressive. A Monte Carlo simulation experiment, including the quantile penalty estimators such as Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net, is designed to evaluate the performances of the proposed techniques. Finally, the theoretical risks of the listed estimators are given.",2017,Thermal Science
Driving behaviors associated with emergency service vehicle crashes in the U.S. fire service.,"OBJECTIVE
Emergency service vehicle incidents are a leading cause of firefighter fatalities and are also hazardous to civilian road users. Modifiable driving behaviors may be associated with emergency service vehicle incidents. The goal of this study was to use telematics to identify driving behaviors associated with crashes in the fire service.


METHODS
Forty-three emergency service vehicles in 2 fire departments were equipped with telematics devices (12 in Department A and 31 in Department B). The devices collected vehicle coordinates, speed, and g forces, which were monitored for exceptions to driving rules established by the fire departments regarding speeding, harsh braking, and hard cornering. Fire department administrative reports were used to identify vehicles involved in crashes and merged with daily telematics data. Penalized logistic regression was used to identify driving rules associated with crashes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to generate a telematics-based risk index for emergency service vehicle incidents.


RESULTS
Nearly 1.1 million km of driving data and 44 crashes were recorded among the 2 departments during the study. Harsh braking was associated with increased odds of crash in Department A (odds ratio [OR]â€‰=â€‰2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-4.51) and Department B (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.55; 95% CI, 1.12-2.15). For every kilometer of nonemergency speeding, the odds of crash increased by 35% in Department A (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.35; 95% CI, 1.03-1.77) and by over 2-fold in Department B (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.09; 95% CI, 1.19-3.66). In Department B, hard cornering (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.14; 95% CI, 1.03-1.26) and emergency speeding (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.65; 95% CI, 1.06-2.57) were also associated with increased odds of crash. The final LASSO risk index model had a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 57%.


CONCLUSIONS
Harsh braking and excessive speeding were driving behaviors most associated with crash in the fire service. Telematics may be a useful tool for monitoring driver safety in the fire service.",2018,Traffic injury prevention
A robust gene signature for the prediction of early relapse in stage Iâ€“III colon cancer,"Colon cancer patients experiencing early relapse consistently exhibited poor survival. The aim of our study was to develop an mRNA signature that can help to detect early relapse cases in stage I-III colon cancer. Public microarray datasets of stage I-III colon cancer samples were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Propensity score matching analysis was performed between patients in the early relapse group and the long-term survival group from GSE39582 discovery series (NÂ =Â 386), and patients were 1Â :Â 1 matched. Global mRNA expression changes were then analyzed between the paired groups to identify the differentially expressed genes. Lasso Cox regression modeling analysis was conducted for the selection of prognostic mRNA. Fifteen mRNA were finally identified to build an early relapse classifier. With specific risk score formula, patients were classified into a high-risk group and a low-risk group. Relapse-free survival was significantly different between the two groups in every series, including discovery [hazard ratio (HR): 2.547, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.708-3.797, PÂ <Â 0.001)], internal validation (HR: 5.146, 95% CI: 1.968-13.457, PÂ <Â 0.001), and external validation (HR: 1.977, 95% CI: 1.295-3.021, PÂ <Â 0.001) sets of patients. Time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic at 1Â year suggested more prognostic accuracy of the classifier [area under curve (AUCÂ =Â 0.703)] than the American Joint Commission on Cancer tumor-node-metastasis staging system (AUCÂ =Â 0.659) in all 951 patients. In conclusion, we developed a robust mRNA signature that can effectively classify colon cancer patients into groups with low and high risks of early relapse. This mRNA signature may help select high-risk colon cancer patients who require more aggressive therapeutic intervention.",2018,Molecular Oncology
Association of the IL-10 Gene Family Locus on Chromosome 1 with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA),"BACKGROUND
The cytokine IL-10 and its family members have been implicated in autoimmune diseases and we have previously reported that genetic variants in IL-10 were associated with a rare group of diseases called juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The aim of this study was to fine map genetic variants within the IL-10 cytokine family cluster on chromosome 1 using linkage disequilibrium (LD)-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) approach with imputation and conditional analysis to test for disease associations.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Fifty-three tSNPs were tested for association between Caucasian paediatric cohorts [219 systemic JIA (sJIA), 187 persistent oligoarticular JIA (pOJIA), and 139 extended OJIA (eOJIA) patients], and controls (Wellcome Trust control cohort, WTCCC2). Significant association with sJIA was detected at rs1400986 in the promoter of IL-20 (odds ratio 1.53; 95% CI 1.21-1.93; pâ€Š=â€Š0.0004), but in no other subtypes. Imputation analysis identified additional associated SNPs for pOJIA at IL-20 and IL-24, including a rare, functional, missense variant at IL-24 with a pâ€Š=â€Š0.0002. Penalised logistic regression analysis with HyperLasso and conditional analysis identified several further associations with JIA subtypes. In particular, haplotype analysis refined the sJIA association, with a joint effect at rs1400986 and rs4129024 in intron 1 of MAPKAPK2 (pâ€Š=â€Š3.2E-5). For pOJIA, a 3-SNP haplotype including rs1878672 in intron 3 of IL-10 showed evidence for association (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0018). In eOJIA, rs10863962 (3'UTR of FCAMR) and rs12409577 (intron of IL-19) haplotype showed some evidence of association (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0003).


CONCLUSIONS
This study supports previous association of IL-20 with sJIA. Haplotype analyses provided stronger association signals than single point analyses, while a penalised logistic regression approach also suggested multiple independent association signals. Replication studies are required to confirm or refute these findings. The results indicate that combined effects with unknown/rare variants remain to be characterised in JIA, and represent a possible example of synthetic association in this region.",2012,PLoS ONE

Context-Aware Video Summarization,"We present a method that is able to find the most informative video portions, leading to a summarization of video sequences. In contrast to the existing works, our method is able to capture the important video portions through information about individual local motion regions, as well as the interactions between these motion regions. Specifically, our proposed Context-Aware Video Summarization (CAVS) framework adopts the methodology of sparse coding with generalized sparse group lasso to learn a dictionary of video features and a dictionary of spatio-temporal feature correlation graphs. Sparsity ensures that the most informative features and relationships are retained. The feature correlations, represented by a dictionary of graphs, indicate how motion regions correlate to each other globally. When a new video segment is processed by CAVS, both dictionaries are updated in an online fashion. Specifically, CAVS scans through every video segment to determine if the new features along with the feature correlations, can be sparsely represented by the learned dictionaries. If not, the dictionaries are updated, and the corresponding video segments are incorporated into the summarized video. The results on four public datasets, mostly composed of surveillance videos and a small amount of other online videos, show the effectiveness of our proposed method.",2016,

The artists may take positions with respect to this shared conceptual theme. The precepts are the following: that the network and the digital spaces represent the emergence of a mutating reality. This reality is a deformed expression, an accelerated evolution of our society and our physical world. A (new) world submitted to near-natural and neo-Darwinian processes of evolution and (technological) auto-selection, inside of which the values are melted and mixed: human: nature: machine: information. It is in fact a world that becomes more and more complex and that informs itself: a mutating reality or a recombinant reality. We could describe this as a new layer of information, the noosphere (as described by Th. de Chardin), that adds itself to the already existing environment, the biosphere. Thus, new landscapes and territories are emerging. New architectures, new social relations and forms of communication â€¦",2000,
Structured Sparsity Models for Brain Decoding from fMRI Data,"Structured sparsity methods have been recently proposed that allow to incorporate additional spatial and temporal information for estimating models for decoding mental states from fMRI data. These methods carry the promise of being more interpretable than simpler Lasso or Elastic Net methods. However, despite sparsity has often been advocated as leading to more interpretable models, we show that by itself sparsity and also structured sparsity could lead to unstable models. We present an extension of the Total Variation method and assess several other structured sparsity models on accuracy, sparsity and stability. Our results indicate that structured sparsity via the Sparse Total Variation can mitigate some of the instability inherent in simpler sparse methods, but more research is required to build methods that can reliably infer relevant activation patterns from fMRI data.",2012,2012 Second International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging
Early Cretaceous (Albian) Spores and Pollen from the Glen Rose Formation of Texas and their Significance for Correlation of the Potomac Group,"abstract Because the Gulf Coast Lower Cretaceous is dated by ammonites, it has great potential as a reference section for correlating continental sequences such as the Potomac Group and dating events in the rise of angiosperms. Middle Albian terrestrial palynofloras from Oklahoma have been described in detail, but the early Albian interval, represented in the Glen Rose Formation of Texas, is less well known. Samples from two localities on the Paluxy River, which correlate with horizons containing late early Albian ammonites, are dominated by Classopollis and Exesipollenites, but angiosperm pollen is the next most common terrestrial element, and there are several index spore species for Zone II in the Potomac Group. Among the angiosperms, reticulate monosulcates are most common and diverse, but there are also several tricolpate species. Stratigraphically important angiosperms include the Clavatipollenites rotundus group and reticulate tricolpates, which appear in the upper part of Potomac Zone I and the dated earliest Albian of England and Portugal. However, there are also tricolpates with striate-reticulate sculpture, a pollen type that is not known from upper Zone I but appears in the late early Albian of Portugal. This assemblage contrasts with floras from Potomac Zone II and the middle Albian (lower Fredericksburg Group) of Oklahoma, where tricolpates overtook monosulcate angiosperms in species diversity. These results confirm arguments based on the Portuguese section that there is a significant hiatus between Potomac Zones I and II, and that this gap is at least partly late early Albian. The dominance of Classopollis and Exesipollenites and the occurrence of isolated Northern Gondwanan elements (Sergipea, Tucanopollis) suggest that Texas lay in a transition zone between Southern Laurasia and the hotter and drier Northern Gondwana province, but regional studies are needed to disentangle geographic and climatic factors from effects of the lagoonal local environment.",2018,Palynology
Perceptual quality estimation of H.264/AVC videos using reduced-reference and no-reference models,"Abstract. Reduced-reference (RR) and no-reference (NR) models for video quality estimation, using features that account for the impact of coding artifacts, spatio-temporal complexity, and packet losses, are proposed. The purpose of this study is to analyze a number of potentially quality-relevant features in order to select the most suitable set of features for building the desired models. The proposed sets of features have not been used in the literature and some of the features are used for the first time in this study. The features are employed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), which selects only the most influential of them toward perceptual quality. For comparison, we apply feature selection in the complete feature sets and ridge regression on the reduced sets. The models are validated using a database of H.264/AVC encoded videos that were subjectively assessed for quality in an ITU-T compliant laboratory. We infer that just two features selected by RR LASSO and two bitstream-based features selected by NR LASSO are able to estimate perceptual quality with high accuracy, higher than that of ridge, which uses more features. The comparisons with competing works and two full-reference metrics also verify the superiority of our models.",2016,Journal of Electronic Imaging

Results for our patients were compared with those for a historical control group conventionally treated between 1984 and 1989 (n = 10; mortality rate, 60%); the expected mortality rate, which was based on the Niklasson prognostic score and was calculated for seven patients in this control group, was 73%. A total of 15 patients were treated with PEBE, three (20%) of whom died, whereas the prognostic score (calculated for 14 patients) for this group was 62%. In two of the fatal cases, PEBE was started after a delay of greater than or equal to 40 hours. In the remaining 13 patients, PEBE was started within 5-30 hours after the first hospital admission. The mortality rate among this group was 8% (one of 13 patients); this rate was significantly different from that among the control group (P = .025). For seven patients treated with PEBE, plasma endotoxin concentrations were sequentially measured. The overall half-life (+/- SEM) of endotoxin was 181 +/- 18 minutes. This is approximately the same as reported values for patients who were not treated with PEBE. It is concluded that early initiation of PEBE may improve the rate of survival among patients with meningococcal infection and hypotension but that the mechanism of the beneficial effect is most likely not based on the elimination of endotoxin.",1992,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America
Estimating sparse models from multivariate discrete data via transformed Lasso,"The type of â„“1 norm regularization used in Lasso and related methods typically yields sparse parameter estimates where most of the estimates are equal to zero. We study a class of estimators obtained by applying a linear transformation on the parameter vector before evaluating the â„“1 norm. The resulting â€œtransformed Lassoâ€ yields estimates that are â€œsmoothâ€ in a way that depends on the applied transformation. The optimization problem is convex and can be solved efficiently using existing tools. We present two examples: the Haar transform which corresponds to variable length Markov chain (context-tree) models, and the Walsh-Hadamard transform which corresponds to linear combinations of XOR (parity) functions of binary input features.",2009,2009 Information Theory and Applications Workshop

Identifying Complex Brain Networks Using Penalized Regression Methods,"The recorded electrical activity of complex brain networks through the EEG reflects their intrinsic spatial, temporal and spectral properties. In this work we study the application of new penalized regression methods to i) the spatial characterization of the brain networks associated with the identification of faces and ii) the PARAFAC analysis of resting-state EEG. The use of appropriate constraints through non-convex penalties allowed three types of inverse solutions (Loreta, Lasso Fusion and ENet L) to spatially localize networks in agreement with previous studies with fMRI. Furthermore, we propose a new penalty based in the Information Entropy for the constrained PARAFAC analysis of resting EEG that allowed the identification in time, frequency and space of those brain networks with minimum spectral entropy. This study is an initial attempt to explicitly include complexity descriptors as a constraint in multilinear EEG analysis.",2008,Journal of Biological Physics
Upper and lower bounds for the average value and for the variance of the safety coefficients of structures with random resistance,"SommarioRichiamato un teorema[1] [2] che fornisce un maggiorante della media dei moltiplicatori di collasso plastico di una struttura dotata di elementi a resistenza aleatoria, si dimostra come sia possibile fornirne un minorante.

A Model Selection Criterion for LASSO Estimate with Scaling,"There have been several studies to relax a bias problem in LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator). In this article, we considered to solve a bias problem of LASSO estimator by scaling and derived a model selection criterion under the scaling method. The proposed scaling value is valid to compensate the excessive shrinkage of LASSO estimator and is easy to compute by using LASSO estimator. Moreover, we derived SURE (Steinâ€™s Unbiased Risk Estimate) as a model selection criterion. This analytic solution is also a benefit of the proposed scaling value. Furthermore, we verified the risk estimate and confirmed its effectiveness through a simple numerical example.",2019,
New developments in managing physician-industry relationships.,"OVER THE PAST2YEARS,POLICIES GOVERNING THE RElationship between physicians and pharmaceuticalanddevicecompanieshaveundergoneremarkable changes. A 2004 task force appointed by the AmericanBoardof InternalMedicineFoundation(ABIM)and the Institute on Medicine as a Profession (IMAP) found existing guidelines to be lax. At that time, the industryâ€™s PharmaceuticalResearchandManufacturersofAmerica(PhRMA)Code ignored many salient issues, such as disclosure, speakerâ€™s bureaus,andghostwritingandsetonlymodestboundariesaround dispensing food,gifts, andtravel reimbursements. TheAmericanMedicalAssociationâ€™s ethicalguidelines largelyduplicated PhRMAâ€™s;however,onsuchpracticesasgift taking, itwaseven morepermissive.TheAmericanCollegeofPhysiciansacknowledged the influence of gifts on physician practices but did not prohibit them. Governmentbodies, includingtheOfficeof the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, essentially endorsedthePhRMACode. Academicmedicalcentersdidnot set a better example. Few of them had rigorous policies, and the exceptions received little notice. At that same time, pressure to strengthen the governance of physician-industry relationships was mounting. First, a substantialbodyof research indicated thatgifts, stipends, andhonoraria from drug companies influenced physiciansâ€™ treatment decisions. Second, the media were relentless in exposing drug companyâ€“physicianmisconduct,whichranged fromfalse statements and billing to off-label promotion of products to outright bribery. Third, whistleblowers were alerting federal and state prosecutors to drug and device company illegalities, leading to successful prosecutions that resulted in millions of dollars in settlements and fines. From 2000 to 2004, 12 major health care fraud settlements led to pharmaceutical companies paying almost $4 billion in criminal and civil fines. The largest was the 2001 TAP/Lupron case, with an $875 million settlement. Taken together, these developments were making the status quo unacceptable. In January 2006, the ABIM-IMAP task force published its policy recommendations on conflict of interest. The proposals captured significant media and academic attention and stimulated many academic medical centers (AMCs) to reconsider their guidelines. In April 2008, a task force appointed by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) issued recommendations on conflict of interest, and in June2008, the associationâ€™s executive council approved them. With only a few exceptions, the positions in the 2 documents are similar, providing them with presumptive standing in the field. Both proposals are much more exacting than earlier guidelines on physician-industry relationships. The proposed guidelines prohibit all gifts (zero-dollar limit), whether onor off-site, and prohibit food provided by industry: â€œIndustrysupplied food and meals are considered personal gifts and will not be permitted or accepted.â€ Both proposals recommend that product samples are centrally managed to â€œdistance the company and its products from the physician.â€ The AAMC would also restrict industry representativesâ€™ access to physicians, requiring credentialing mechanisms and formal appointments and invitations. Both propose that industry funds for continuing medical education and travel to bona fide medical meetings should be distributed not by academic departments but from a central medical center office. Both prohibit ghostwriting and differ only on speakerâ€™s bureaus. The ABIM-IMAP task force prohibits these activities; the AAMC proposals â€œstrongly discourageâ€ them. The AAMC report does not make reference to the many positive changes that some of its members have already made. At least 25 medical centers from both the public and the private sectors and from all regions of the country, including Boston University, University of Massachusettsâ€“Worcester, and Yale University; University of Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh University; the universities of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Chicago; and the entire University of California system, now have in place strong conflict-of-interest policies. These AMCs have been joined by such health care delivery organizations as the Henry Ford Health Systems (Detroit), Kaiser Permanente (northern California), and the US Veterans Administration network. How did these changes come about? Immediately after the publication of the ABIM-IMAP recommendations, the Pew Charitable Trusts contacted IMAP to explore strategies to promote their enactment.

Extended Bayesian information criterion in the Cox model with a high-dimensional feature space,"Variable selection in the Cox proportional hazards model (the Cox model) has manifested its importance in many microarray genetic studies. However, theoretical results on the procedures of variable selection in the Cox model with a high-dimensional feature space are rare because of its complicated data structure. In this paper, we consider the extended Bayesian information criterion (EBIC) for variable selection in the Cox model and establish its selection consistency in the situation of high-dimensional feature space. The EBIC is adopted to select the best model from a model sequence generated from the SIS-ALasso procedure.

Performance Analysis of Parameter Estimation Using LASSO,"The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) has gained attention in a wide class of continuous parametric estimation problems with promising results. It has been a subject of research for more than a decade. Due to the nature of LASSO, the previous analyses have been non-parametric. This ignores useful information and makes it difficult to compare LASSO to traditional estimators. In particular, the role of the regularization parameter and super-resolution properties of LASSO have not been well-understood yet. The objective of this work is to provide a new insight into this context by introducing LASSO as a parametric technique of a varying order. This provides us theoretical expressions for the LASSO-based estimation error and false alarm rate in the asymptotic case of high SNR and dense grids. For this case, LASSO is compared to maximum likelihood and conventional beamforming. It is found that LASSO loses performance due to the regularization term, but the amount of loss is practically negligible with a proper choice of the regularization parameter. Thus, we provide suggestions on the selection of the regularization parameter. Without loss of generality, we present the comparative numerical results in the context of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation using a sensor array.",2012,arXiv: Computation

Stable LASSO for High-Dimensional Feature Selection through Proximal Optimization,"The l1-norm regularization is commonly used when estimating (generalized) linear models while enforcing sparsity. The automatic feature selection embedded in such an estimation is however known to be highly unstable since, among correlated features, an l1 penalty tends to favor the selection of a single feature, essentially picked at random. This paper introduces a modified optimization objective to stabilize LASSO or similar approaches. The solution to this modified problem is constrained by a norm ball rescaled according to the variances of the predictor variables. We further describe how such problems can be efficiently solved through proximal optimization. Classification experiments conducted on several microarray datasets show the benefits of the proposed approach, both in terms of stability and predictive performances, as compared to the original LASSO, Elastic Net, Trace LASSO and a simple variance based filtering.",2013,
An Ensemble Approach to Knowledge-Based Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy Planning,"Knowledge-based planning (KBP) utilizes experienced planners' knowledge embedded in prior plans to estimate optimal achievable dose volume histogram (DVH) of new cases. In the regression-based KBP framework, previously planned patients' anatomical features and DVHs are extracted, and prior knowledge is summarized as the regression coefficients that transform features to organ-at-risk DVH predictions. In our study, we find that in different settings, different regression methods work better. To improve the robustness of KBP models, we propose an ensemble method that combines the strengths of various linear regression models, including stepwise, lasso, elastic net, and ridge regression. In the ensemble approach, we first obtain individual model prediction metadata using in-training-set leave-one-out cross validation. A constrained optimization is subsequently performed to decide individual model weights. The metadata is also used to filter out impactful training set outliers. We evaluate our method on a fresh set of retrospectively retrieved anonymized prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) cases and head and neck IMRT cases. The proposed approach is more robust against small training set size, wrongly labeled cases, and dosimetric inferior plans, compared with other individual models. In summary, we believe the improved robustness makes the proposed method more suitable for clinical settings than individual models.",2018,Frontiers in Oncology
Bayesian Gaussian Graphical models using sparse selection priors and their mixtures,"Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models Using Sparse Selection Priors and Their Mixtures. (August 2011) Rajesh Talluri, B.Tech., Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati Co-Chairs of Advisory Committee: Dr. Bani K. Mallick Dr. Veerabhadran Baladandayuthapani We propose Bayesian methods for estimating the precision matrix in Gaussian graphical models. The methods lead to sparse and adaptively shrunk estimators of the precision matrix, and thus conduct model selection and estimation simultaneously. Our methods are based on selection and shrinkage priors leading to parsimonious parameterization of the precision (inverse covariance) matrix, which is essential in several applications in learning relationships among the variables. In Chapter I, we employ the Laplace prior on the off-diagonal element of the precision matrix, which is similar to the lasso model in a regression context. This type of prior encourages sparsity while providing shrinkage estimates. Secondly we introduce a novel type of selection prior that develops a sparse structure of the precision matrix by making most of the elements exactly zero, ensuring positive-definiteness. In Chapter II we extend the above methods to perform classification. Reversephase protein array (RPPA) analysis is a powerful, relatively new platform that allows for high-throughput, quantitative analysis of protein networks. One of the challenges that currently limits the potential of this technology is the lack of methods that allows for accurate data modeling and identification of related networks and samples. Such models may improve the accuracy of biological sample classification based on patterns of protein network activation, and provide insight into the distinct biological relationships underlying different cancers. We propose a Bayesian sparse graphical modeling",2012,
Quality Control of a Health Information System for Causes of Death Statistics in Burkina Faso Using Capture-Recapture Method,"INTRODUCTION
The information system on the causes of death (ISCD), set up in Burkina Faso in January 2014 at the University Hospital Center Souro Sanon (UHCSS) of Bobo-Dioulasso, was evaluated to assess its completeness in terms of death statistics generation.


METHOD
The capture-recapture method was used to assess this quality control using the three-sources technique.


RESULTS
The cross verification of the three data sources (mortuary, admission department, death certificate) gave the following estimations: number of deaths observed: 735, total estimated deaths: 852 [820-900], i.e. 86% of completeness achieved by the statistics generating system.


DISCUSSION
The ISCD is functional and produces easy-to-cross-check quality data. It could be extended to the entire country for the generation of mortality statistics. Nevertheless, it needs to be improved before deploying across the country.",2016,Studies in health technology and informatics

The Youngest Species of the Aquatic Sloth Thalassocnus and a Reassessment of the Relationships of the Nothrothere Sloths (mammalia: Xenarthra),"Abstract Two new specimens of the aquatic sloth Thalassocnus from the Pliocene of Peru are described, one of T. carolomartini McDonald and Muizon, 2002 and the other T. yaucensis, sp. nov. Comparisons with the type species of Thalassocnus, T. natans, demonstrates that T. carolomartini and T. yaucensis are more similar morphologically to each other than to other species of the genus and are more derived. For example, both have a more elongated rostrum (premaxillae and mandibular spout) and more robust, quadrate to circular molariform teeth. The aquatic sloth Thalassocnus is sufficiently distinct morphologically that it is placed in a new subfamily, the Thalassocninae, and the Nothrotheriinae is raised to family rank. The morphological features shared by T. carolomartini and T. yaucensis indicate these species were better adapted to grazing on marine vegetation than earlier species of Thalassocnus.",2004,

Patientenseitiger GesprÃ¤chsbedarf nach einem geriatrischen Assessment in Hausarztpraxen,"ZusammenfassungHintergrundDer GesprÃ¤chsbedarf (GB) hausÃ¤rztlicher Patienten wird anlassorientiert erhoben und bearbeitet. Ein geriatrisches Assessment zielt auf eine ganzheitliche Erfassung des Gesundheits- und Funktionszustands und ermÃ¶glicht eine Thematisierung von Problemen, die Ã¼ber aktuelle BeratungsanlÃ¤sse hinausgehen.Ziel der ArbeitZiel ist es, AusmaÃŸ und Art des patientenseitigen GB nach einem hausÃ¤rztlichen Assessment zu beschreiben und Einflussfaktoren auf den GB zu ermitteln.Material und MethodenEs erhielten 317Â Patienten (â‰¥â€‰70Â Jahre) in 40Â Hausarztpraxen ein geriatrisches Assessment. Die erhobenen Probleme wurden in einer Ergebnisliste dokumentiert und den Patienten im Anschluss vorgelegt. Diese bewerteten jedes Problem hinsichtlich subjektiver Relevanz und GB. In die Auswertung gingen HÃ¤ufigkeitsanalysen zur subjektiven Relevanz und zum GB der vorliegenden Gesundheitsprobleme ein. In einem gemischten Modell wurden Einflussfaktoren auf den patientenseitigen GB untersucht.ErgebnisseDie 317Â Patienten wiesen im Median 11Â Gesundheitsprobleme auf [Interquartilsabstand (IQA) 8â€“14]. Von den Patienten hatten 80â€‰% einen GB â€“ und diesen zu wenigen Problemen. Ein hoher GB fand sich fÃ¼r kÃ¶rperliche Beschwerden und den Impfschutz. Wenig GB bestand fÃ¼r ungesunde Lebensgewohnheiten, StÃ¼rze, Alltagsfunktionen und psychosoziale Probleme.

Dazu zÃ¤hlen Probleme in der Alltagsfunktion und im psychosozialen Bereich.AbstractBackgroundDuring a doctor-patient consultation patients usually seek information by disclosing their reasons for requesting the encounter. Geriatric assessment allows a proactive examination of patientsâ€™ overall health and function and provides an opportunity to broach issues beyond the initial purposes of the consultation.ObjectivesThe study aimed at investigating older patientsâ€™ information seeking behavior following a geriatric assessment and the kind of topics they wished to discuss, taking a variety of patient and health-related factors into account.Material and methodsA total of 317 patients (â‰¥â€‰70 years) underwent a geriatric assessment in 40 general practices. Subsequently they obtained a list of the problems uncovered and rated the relevance and information needs for each problem. Analyses consisted of determining the prevalence of information need for each health topic and identifying predictors in a mixed model (multilevel regression analysis).ResultsThe 317 patients presented with a median of 11 health problems (interquartile range, IQR 8â€“14) and 80â€‰% of the patients had information needs concerning only a few of the problems. High information needs were present for physical complaints and for vaccination issues. Little information seeking behavior was evident for unhealthy lifestyles, falls, limitations in daily activities and psychosocial problems. In the mixed model the personal relevance and the type of health problem both had a significant and independent effect on information seeking behavior.ConclusionA geriatric assessment generates a moderate need for information. It provides physicians with an opportunity to focus on those health problems that are important to older patients but not usually addressed in normal consultations. This particularly applies to limitations in daily activities and psychosocial problems.",2015,Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Gerontologie und Geriatrie
Forecasting Solar Irradiance from Time Series with Exogenous Information,"Solar irradiance forecast is the pivotal factor for power generation scheduling at photovoltaic (PV) power plants. To this end, we propose a framework to model solar irradiance that leverages both short-term dependency (several days) and dependency on time in the annual cycle. We focus on two classes of methods, autoregressive (AR), and autoregressive with exogenous variables (ARX), and investigate LASSO regression, and non-linear methods, including support vector regression (SVR) and long short-term memory (LSTM) as the underlying mechanism. Our experiments on data collected at a PV power plant for over five years show that considering external information such as weather on top of the historical solar irradiance data for longer period of time lowers the error of solar irradiance forecast.",2017,
Some Environmental Contaminants Influence Motor and Feeding Behaviors in the Ornate Wrasse (Thalassoma pavo) via Distinct Cerebral Histamine Receptor Subtypes,"Common environmental contaminants such as heavy metals and pesticides pose serious risks to behavioral and neuroendocrine functions of many aquatic organisms. In the present study, we show that the heavy metal cadmium and the pesticide endosulfan produce such effects through an interaction of specific cerebral histamine receptor subtypes in the teleost ornate wrasse (Thalassoma pavo). Treatment of this teleost with toxic cadmium levels for 1 week was sufficient to induce abnormal swimming movements, whereas reduced feeding behaviors were provoked predominantly by elevated endosulfan concentrations. In the brain, these environmental contaminants caused neuronal degeneration in cerebral targets such as the mesencephalon and hypothalamus, damage that appeared to correlate with altered binding levels of the three major histamine receptors (subtypes 1, 2, and 3). Although cadmium accounted for reduced binding activity of all three subtypes in most brain regions, it was subtype 2 that seemed to be its main target, as shown by a very great (p < 0.001) down-regulation in mesencephalic areas such as the stratum griseum central layer. Conversely, endosulfan provided very great and great (p < 0.01) up-regulating effects of subtype 3 and 1 levels, respectively, in preoptic-hypothalamic areas such as the medial part of the lateral tuberal nucleus, and in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These results suggest that the neurotoxicant-dependent abnormal motor and feeding behaviors may well be tightly linked to binding activities of distinct histamine subtypes in localized brain regions of the Thalassoma pavo.",2005,Environmental Health Perspectives
The expressivity of turn-taking: Understanding children pragmatics by hybrid classifiers,"We analyze the effect of children age on pragmatic skills, i.e. on the way children manage the conversation dynamics. In particular, we focus exclusively on the turn-taking (who talks when and how much), reducing conversations as sequences of simple speech/silence periods. Employing a hybrid (generative + discriminative) classification framework, we demonstrate that such a simple signature is very informative, allowing to separate 22 â€œpre-Schoolâ€ conversations (between 3-4 years old children) and 24 â€œSchoolâ€ conversations (between 6-8 years old children) subjects, with 78% of accuracy. The framework exploits Steady Conversational Periods and Observed Influence Models as feature extractors, plus LASSO regression as feature selector and classifier. The generative nature of our method permits, as byproduct, to identify the pragmatic skills that better discriminate the two groups: no-tably, scholar children tend to have more frequent periods of sustained conversation, in a statistically significant way.",2013,2013 14th International Workshop on Image Analysis for Multimedia Interactive Services (WIAMIS)

Le manifestazioni cliniche associate al rettocele sono molteplici: ginecologiche, tipo tumefazione vaginale, eventualmente associata a un prolasso urogenitale, o digestive, tipo ostruzione alla defecazione e, in questo caso, e spesso associato a un prolasso interno del retto. La decisione chirurgica si basa su un bilancio pelvico clinico completo, su un bilancio funzionale e morfologico basato su una valutazione precisa dei sintomi riferiti dai pazienti, su un bilancio radiologico anorettale (defecografia con opacizzazione delle anse del tenue e/o defeco-risonanza magnetica [RM]), su una manometria anorettale e su un bilancio urodinamico. La correzione del rettocele isolato puo essere realizzata per via bassa, perineale. La via transanale tradizionale (Sullivan, Khubchandani) permette una plicatura endoluminale della muscolatura rettale e una resezione della mucosa rettale distesa dal rettocele. Essa tende a subire la concorrenza delle tecniche di resezione rettale transanale con graffe (STARR e trans-STARR), anche se questi approcci restano limitati a casi selezionati. Lâ€™accesso perineovaginale aggredisce il rettocele dalla sua faccia vaginale (il colpocele): delle borse concentriche e la rimessa in tensione della fascia rettale la riducono; una miorrafia dei muscoli elevatori dellâ€™ano, rispettando il calibro della vagina, rinforza la riparazione e rimette in tensione il pavimento pelvico. La sospensione vaginale al legamento sacrospinoso (Richter) puo completare il montaggio chirurgico in caso di associazione a un elitrocele. Lâ€™uso di protesi di rinforzo del setto rettovaginale per via perineale e oggetto di dibattiti non ancora risolti a causa di una valutazione ancora frammentaria del rischio di erosione, di infezione e di esposizione del materiale impiantato. Queste tecniche hanno una morbilita essenzialmente locale. I loro risultati funzionali, complessivamente buoni, rimangono dipendenti dal contesto clinico e dalla scelta dellâ€™indicazione chirurgica. La via alta addominale e un accesso alternativo che puo essere preferibile quando sono necessarie procedure associate sulla filiera urinaria e/o genitale, per un rettocele che si associa ad altri elementi di prolasso. Essa consente, dopo clivaggio rettovaginale e douglassectomia, di rinforzare il setto rettovaginale con una protesi non riassorbibile e di sospendere senza tensione la faccia anteriore del retto e posteriore della vagina al promontorio lombosacrale. Lâ€™approccio laparoscopico e, ora, lo standard per la realizzazione di questa procedura chirurgica di sospensione del piano posteriore della pelvi. Il trattamento chirurgico e indicato davanti a un rettocele sintomatico, quando la rieducazione mediante biofeedback di una dissincronia addominosfinterica e il trattamento medico della stipsi non hanno corretto la compromissione funzionale. In assenza di fattori predittivi del risultato postoperatorio, le pazienti devono essere informate del rischio di correzione incompleta dei sintomi o di insuccesso. Le anomalie associate della statica pelviperineale devono essere identificate durante la gestione di un rettocele e trattate contemporaneamente.",2018,EMC - Tecniche Chirurgiche Addominale
Prospect Utility Portfolio Optimization Selection and optmization using gradient and regularization techniques,"Portfolio choice theory have in the last decades seen a rise in utilising more advanced utility functions for finding optimal portfolios. This is partly a consequence of the relatively simplistic nature of the quadratic utility, which is often assumed in the classical mean-variance framework. There have been some suggestions on how to find optimal portfolios in accordance to more realistic utility functions gathered from Prospect theory. However, some of these methods suffer from practical drawbacks. This paper proposes a method consisting of a mixture between two optimization techniques, in order to find a portfolio allocation that is optimal in relation to the first four moments. In the empirical implementation, we utilise the S-shaped and Bilinear utility functions gathered from Prospect Theory. Results hold in an in-sample testing environment. Improving expected utility, and the first three moments when tested against a standard benchmark method, as well as in measurement of the Sharpe Ratio.

Arzneimittelassoziierte AngioÃ¶deme,"ZusammenfassungBei AngioÃ¶demen kÃ¶nnen pathophysiologisch histamin- und bradykininmediierte Formen unterschieden werden. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme(ACE)-Hemmer-induzierte AngioÃ¶deme sind der Prototyp arzneimittelassoziierter, bradykininmediierter AngioÃ¶deme. Als Ursache wird ein verminderter Bradykininabbau durch die Hemmung des ACE angenommen. In diesem Fall kommt anderen Bradykinin degradierenden Enzymen eine grÃ¶ÃŸere Bedeutung zu. Wenn auch diese z.â€¯B. durch genetische Varianten oder Ã¤uÃŸere Faktoren in ihrer Wirkung vermindert sind, kann die Hemmung des ACE mÃ¶glicherweise nicht ausreichend kompensiert werden. Auch fÃ¼r andere Arzneimittel wurde Ã¼ber ein erhÃ¶htes AngioÃ¶demrisiko bei alleiniger Anwendung oder insbesondere in Kombination mit ACE-Hemmern berichtet. UrsÃ¤chlich wurde ebenfalls ein Zusammenhang mit dem Abbau von Bradykinin vermutet. Dabei kÃ¶nnten bei den AngioÃ¶demen, die bei gleichzeitiger Anwendung von ACE-Hemmern mit anderen Arzneimitteln auftreten, additive Effekte in Bezug auf den Bradykininabbau eine Rolle spielen.AbstractOn aÂ pathophysiological level, angioedema can be differentiated into histamine- and bradykinin-mediated types. The prototype drug-associated, bradykinin-mediated form of angioedema is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema. The hypothesized cause is aÂ decrease in bradykinin degradation via ACE inhibition. In this scenario, other bradykinin-degrading enzymes assume major importance. When the effect of these enzymes is also diminished, e.â€¯g., due to genetic variants or external factors, compensation for the inhibition of ACE may be insufficient. An increased risk of angioedema has also been reported for other drugs, particularly when prescribed in combination with ACE inhibitors. Here, the suspected cause also relates to the degradation of bradykinin. When angioedema arises within the context of concomitant ACE inhibitor use, additive bradykinin degradation effects may be implicated.",2017,Der Hautarzt
Graphical Aids for Nonlinear Regression and Discriminant Analysis,"In nonlinear regression and discriminant analysis applications, graphical displays can facilitate understanding and communication with subject area researchers. For nonlinear regression, Cook-Weisberg confidence curves, Wald intervals, and contour plots of the loss function in the parameter space provide information about the certainty of estimates and also about estimates of functions of parameters. For linear and quadratic discriminant analysis models, scatterplots bordered by box plots aid transformation selection as the data analyst uses a GUI to quickly transform plot scales. A lasso plot tool provides a link from points (cases) in displays to a data worksheet with all values. Within-group histograms help outlier detection and to study the spread across groups. A failure of the equal covariance matrix assumption may be seen in within-group scatterplot matrices embellished with ellipses of concentration. Enhancements to canonical variable plots allow easy identification of misclassified cases.",1992,

The adaptive lasso in high-dimensional sparse heteroscedastic models,"In this paper we study the asymptotic properties of the adaptive Lasso estimate in high-dimensional sparse linear regression models with heteroscedastic errors. It is demonstrated that model selection properties and asymptotic normality of the selected parameters remain valid but with a suboptimal asymptotic variance. A weighted adaptive Lasso estimate is introduced and investigated. In particular, it is shown that the new estimate performs consistent model selection and that linear combinations of the estimates corresponding to the non-vanishing components are asymptotically normally distributed with a smaller variance than those obtained by the â€œclassicalâ€ adaptive Lasso. The results are illustrated in a data example and by means of a small simulation study.",2013,Mathematical Methods of Statistics

Support Recovery for Sparse Deconvolution of Positive Measures,"We study sparse spikes deconvolution over the space of Radon measures on $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{T}$ when the input measure is a finite sum of positive Dirac masses using the BLASSO convex program. We focus on the recovery properties of the support and the amplitudes of the initial measure in the presence of noise as a function of the minimum separation $t$ of the input measure (the minimum distance between two spikes). We show that when ${w}/\lambda$, ${w}/t^{2N-1}$ and $\lambda/t^{2N-1}$ are small enough (where $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter, $w$ the noise and $N$ the number of spikes), which corresponds roughly to a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and a noise level small enough with respect to the minimum separation, there exists a unique solution to the BLASSO program with exactly the same number of spikes as the original measure. We show that the amplitudes and positions of the spikes of the solution both converge toward those of the input measure when the noise and the regularization parameter drops to zero faster than $t^{2N-1}$.",2015,ArXiv
Parameter estimation of multinomial logistic regression model using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO),"Regression modeling was used to describe the relationship between the response variable and one or more predictor variables. For a categorical response variable, the logistic regression would be more appropriate for this. It is not uncommon that we encounter a response variable with more than two categories. Hence, we end up modeling a multinomial logistic regression. The estimation of the parameters of the model was done using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Furthermore, we used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to further facilitate variable selection in the model. Case studies and simulations were studied using the LASSO model, and are implemented in R. We then implement the LASSO model to analyze the data of senior high school preferences by Public Junior High School and Islamic Junior High School students in Trenggalek Regency, East Java, Indonesia. The influencing factors from the model with LASSO were average score during the 8th semester, school type, fatherâ€™s occupation, motherâ€™s occupation, motherâ€™s last education, fatherâ€™s income, motherâ€™s income, and long term plan. The response variable was assumed to follow a multinomial distribution, with three levels. A random error was assumed to follow the normal distribution. There were two predictor variables, and various sample sizes were considered.

A novel predictive approach for GVHD after allogeneic SCT based on clinical variables and cytokine gene polymorphisms.,"Despite considerable advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), its prediction remains unresolved and depends mainly on clinical data. The aim of this study is to build a predictive model based on clinical variables and cytokine gene polymorphism for predicting acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) from the analysis of a large cohort of HLA-identical sibling donor allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) patients. A total of 25 SNPs in 12 cytokine genes were evaluated in 509 patients. Data were analyzed using a linear regression model and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The statistical model was constructed by randomly selecting 85% of cases (training set), and the predictive ability was confirmed based on the remaining 15% of cases (test set). Models including clinical and genetic variables (CG-M) predicted severe aGVHD significantly better than models including only clinical variables (C-M) or only genetic variables (G-M). For grades 3-4 aGVHD, the correct classification rates (CCR1) were: 100% for CG-M, 88% for G-M, and 50% for C-M. On the other hand, CG-M and G-M predicted extensive cGVHD better than C-M (CCR1: 80% vs. 66.7%, respectively). A risk score was calculated based on LASSO multivariate analyses. It was able to correctly stratify patients who developed grades 3-4 aGVHD (P < .001) and extensive cGVHD (P < .001). The novel predictive models proposed here improve the prediction of severe GVHD after allo-SCT. This approach could facilitate personalized risk-adapted clinical management of patients undergoing allo-SCT.",2018,Blood advances

A General Framework for Robust Testing and Confidence Regions in High-Dimensional Quantile Regression,"We propose a robust inferential procedure for assessing uncertainties of parameter estimation in high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension $p$ can grow exponentially fast with the sample size $n$. Our method combines the de-biasing technique with the composite quantile function to construct an estimator that is asymptotically normal. Hence it can be used to construct valid confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests. Our estimator is robust and does not require the existence of first or second moment of the noise distribution. It also preserves efficiency in the sense that the worst case efficiency loss is less than 30\% compared to the square-loss-based de-biased Lasso estimator. In many cases our estimator is close to or better than the latter, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Our de-biasing procedure does not require solving the $L_1$-penalized composite quantile regression. Instead, it allows for any first-stage estimator with desired convergence rate and empirical sparsity. The paper also provides new proof techniques for developing theoretical guarantees of inferential procedures with non-smooth loss functions. To establish the main results, we exploit the local curvature of the conditional expectation of composite quantile loss and apply empirical process theories to control the difference between empirical quantities and their conditional expectations. Our results are established under weaker assumptions compared to existing work on inference for high-dimensional quantile regression. Furthermore, we consider a high-dimensional simultaneous test for the regression parameters by applying the Gaussian approximation and multiplier bootstrap theories. We also study distributed learning and exploit the divide-and-conquer estimator to reduce computation complexity when the sample size is massive. Finally, we provide empirical results to verify the theory.",2014,arXiv: Machine Learning
Pollen analysis of two travertine sections in BaskÃ¶y (southwestern Turkey): implications for environmental conditions during the early Holocene,"Two travertine sections in the valley of Baskoy, near the archaeological site of Sagalassos have been palynologically investigated. The base of one of these sections has been dated to 9000Â±600 yr B.P. by the U/Th dating technique. The pollen diagrams of both sections reveal the importance of deciduous Quercus and Betula woodlands during deposition of the travertine. The development of woodlands in the early Holocene implies an increase in humidity after the Late Pleistocene. An annual precipitation of at least 500 mm/yr is suggested. A study of the Î´18O values of the travertines in the sections indicates a change to higher precipitation temperatures of the travertines and hence a climatic change to higher air temperatures around 9000Â±600 yr B.P. This increase in temperature is not documented in the pollen diagrams. The evaluation of the local pollen curves provides additional information on the depositional environment. The facies and pollen analyses indicate that the travertines were deposited in a fluvialâ€“barrage system. High abundances of Cyperaceae pollen suggest a marshy environment and fluctuating water levels of this early Holocene fluvial-barrage system. High percentages of Poaceae and/or Aster and Menthaâ€“Thymus pollen types point to drier local conditions at the beginning and the end of the travertine accumulation of both sections.",1999,Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology

Cleaner wrasse forage on ectoparasitic digeneans (phylum Platyhelminthes) that infect pelagic thresher sharks (AlopiasÂ pelagicus),"The cleaning system is a classic model for cooperative behaviour among species in which cleaner fish or shrimps remove parasites and/or dead tissue from clients that pose at stations to solicit services from them (Cote 2000). Sharks, including pelagic thresher sharks, host a variety of ectoparasites that may affect their health and fitness (Oliver et al. 2011). While ectoparasitic digeneans have been observed to infect thresher sharks (Curran and Overstreet 2000), their association with cleaner fish diet has not been previously documented. In August 2013, light microscopy was used to examine ectoparasite specimens that were taken from the cloacas of dead pelagic thresher sharks caught in the central Visayas of the Philippines (N 11Â°19â€², E 124Â° 11â€²), near a cleaning station that they are known to frequent (Oliver et al. 2011) (Fig. 1). The morphology of the parasites, and measurements carried out revealed that the samples belonged to the genus Paronatrema (Dollfus 1937) (Family: Syncoeliidae). Previous observations made at this site showed that cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus and Thalassoma lunare) preferentially forage in the pelvic region of thresher sharks (Oliver et al. 2011). Since no other species of parasite was found in this area of the dead thresher sharks, it appears likely that digeneans comprise an important part of cleaner fish diet. While the inclusion of helminths in the diet of cleaners is well documented (Cote 2000), this is the first instance in which digenea have been observed to contribute to the cleaner-client system.",2014,Marine Biodiversity

The Reciprocal Bayesian LASSO,"A reciprocal LASSO (rLASSO) regularization employs a decreasing penalty function as opposed to conventional penalization methods that use increasing penalties on the coefficients, leading to stronger parsimony and superior model selection relative to traditional shrinkage methods. Here we consider a fully Bayesian formulation of the rLASSO problem, which is based on the observation that the rLASSO estimate for linear regression parameters can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior mode estimate when the regression parameters are assigned independent inverse Laplace priors. Bayesian inference from this posterior is possible using an expanded hierarchy motivated by a scale mixture of double Pareto or truncated normal distributions. On simulated and real datasets, we show that the Bayesian formulation outperforms its classical cousin in estimation, prediction, and variable selection across a wide range of scenarios while offering the advantage of posterior inference. Finally, we discuss other variants of this new approach and provide a unified framework for variable selection using flexible reciprocal penalties.

Making choices that matter â€“ Use of statistical regularization in species distribution modelling for identification of climatic indicators â€“ A case study with Mikania micrantha Kunth in India,"Abstract Biological invasions by alien non-indigenous species are one of the major problems of the present era which impose massive environmental and socio-economic costs. In India about 40% of the floral species have long been recognized to be aliens, but the need for priority conservation efforts has only been felt since the turn of the century. Thus, it is now of utmost importance to predict the potential distribution of invasive alien species and identify suitable environmental conditions that allow the species to spread rapidly. The invasive plant Mikania micrantha was chosen as the test species. Native occurrence records (longitude and latitude) were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). For Indian occurrences, GBIF records were supplemented with occurrences from herbaria label data and information gathered from published literature. Nineteen climatic variables were obtained from World-Clim databse. To predict the potential distribution, species distribution models (SDMs) were built by using logistic regression and the climatic variables were chosen by using two cross-validated regularization methods induced by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) and the ridge penalty function. This approach has twofold benefits; it deals with the multicollinearity problem efficiently and selects the raw environmental covariates. F Î² -score was utilized to measure the modelsâ€™ performance. Combining the data from both native and alien ranges, seven environmental predictors were selected using four different background choices. Using lasso penalty, mean diurnal range (mean of monthly (max temp â€“ min temp)) (BIO2), Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (Ã—100) (BIO3), Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6) (BIO7), Precipitation of Wettest Month (BIO13), Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) (BIO15) and Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (BIO18) were found to be strong correlates for all four backgrounds. The predicted probabilities from the model containing these seven selected variables, demonstrated higher invasion risk in the central part of India than the model containing all the predictors. Accurate analysis of present distributions and effective predictive modelling of future distributions of invasive alien species is of vital importance for the early detection of the invasion and rapid remedial actions downstream. This study may aid in the adoption of management initiatives like early detection and rapid response. This could result in identifying both new populations and established populations to be prioritized for management.",2019,Ecological Indicators
Estimation of High-Dimensional Seemingly Unrelated Regression Models,"In this paper, we investigate seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models that allow the number of equations (N) to be large, and to be comparable to the number of the observations in each equation (T). It is well known in the literature that the conventional SUR estimator, for example, the generalized least squares (GLS) estimator of Zellner (1962) does not perform well. As the main contribution of the paper, we propose a new feasible GLS estimator called the feasible graphical lasso (FGLasso) estimator. For a feasible implementation of the GLS estimator, we use the graphical lasso estimation of the precision matrix (the inverse of the covariance matrix of the equation system errors) assuming that the underlying unknown precision matrix is sparse. We derive asymptotic theories of the new estimator and investigate its finite sample properties via Monte-Carlo simulations.",2018,arXiv: Econometrics
Growth and population dynamics of Thalassodendron ciliatum in a Kenyan back-reef lagoon,"Abstract The size, rhizome growth, and demography of a Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forssk.) den Hartog population in a back-reef lagoon (Chale lagoon, Kenya), was examined using techniques based on age determinations. The results obtained reveal that vertical growth of the T. ciliatum shoots is very fast, involving the production of, on average, 42 internodes (i.e. 42 leaves) per year. Annual length increments declined from young shoots (17 cm year âˆ’1 ) to older shoots (6 cm year âˆ’1 ). Vertical growth is not constant over the year with internodal length sequences suggesting the presence of two adverse periods for vertical growth in a year. As a result, the T. ciliatum population allocated a significant fraction of their biomass production (31%) to upright stems, which can grow for up to 5 years (the maximum life span of vertical shoots). The vertical growth of this species is the fastest reported to date for an undisturbed seagrass population, whereas the horizontal growth rates (16 cm year âˆ’1 ) rank amongst the slowest. The turnover time of the shoots was about 1 year (i.e. the median shoot life span), with shoot mortality and recruitment maintaining a close balance (0.71 Â± 0.04 natural log units year âˆ’1 and 0.65 natural log units year âˆ’1 , respectively), indicating that the population is in a steady state condition. Because horizontal rhizome growth was slow (producing six shoots per rhizome apex year âˆ’1 ), shoot recruitment through branching of vertical shoots (20% of the vertical shoots bearing branches) is an important component of clonal growth of this population. These results demonstrate that vertical growth is an essential component of the production of T. ciliatum , to which it allocates considerable resources. This allocation is used to raise the photosynthetic tissues well above the sediments, thereby preventing competition with other benthic phototrophs. It also guarantees sufficient shoot recruitment for maintenance of the population.",1996,Aquatic Botany
"Differentially Private Feature Selection via Stability Arguments, and the Robustness of the Lasso","We design differentially private algorithms for statistical model selection. Given a data set and a large, discrete collection of â€œmodelsâ€, each of which is a family of probability distributions, the goal is to determine the model that best â€œfitsâ€ the data. This is a basic problem in many areas of statistics and machine learning. We consider settings in which there is a well-defined answer, in the following sense: Suppose that there is a nonprivate model selection proceduref which is the reference to which we compare our performance. Our differentially private algorithms output the correct valuef(D) wheneverf is stable on the input data setD. We work with two notions, perturbation stability and subsampling stability. We give two classes of results: generic ones, that apply to any function with discrete output set; and specific algorithms for the problem of sparse linear regression. The algorithms we describe are efficient and in some cases match the optimal nonprivate asymptotic sample complexity. Our algorithms for sparse linear regression require analyzing the stability properties of the popular LASSO estimator. We give sufficient conditions for the LASSO estimator to be robust to small changes in the data set, and show that these conditions hold with high probability under essentially the same stochastic assumptions that are used in the literature to analyze convergence of the LASSO.",2013,
Estimating spatial covariance using penalised likelihood with weighted L 1 penalty,"In spatial statistics, the estimation of covariance matrices is of great importance because of its role in spatial prediction and design. In this paper, we propose a penalised likelihood approach with weighted L 1 regularisation to estimate the covariance matrix for spatial Gaussian Markov random field models with unspecified neighbourhood structures. A new algorithm for ordering spatial points is proposed such that the corresponding precision matrix can be estimated more effectively. Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm to minimise the penalised likelihood via a novel usage of the regularised solution path algorithm, which does not require the use of iterative algorithms. By exploiting the sparsity structure in the precision matrix, we show that the LASSO type of approach gives improved covariance estimators measured by several criteria. Asymptotic properties of our proposed estimator are derived. Both our simulated examples and an application to the rainfall data set show that the proposed method performs competitively.",2009,Journal of Nonparametric Statistics
Role Segregation For Fun and Profit: The Daily Behavior of the West African Lorry Driver,"HE purpose of this paper is to present evidence of the changes which occur in the behavior of truck and lorry drivers when they are operating their vehicles as opposed to their behavior at other times. Specifically, it is hypothesized that drivers of trucks and lorries in certain West African societies behave in a very time and profit oriented, efficiency conscious manner when they are actually driving, but that this mode of behavior is not carried over into other spheres of their daily interaction. The impression, to use Ferdinand Tonnies' terms (1887), is one of an island of gesellschaft behavior (driving the vehicle) surrounded by an ocean of gemeinschaft behavior (the remainder of daily life). The data upon which this paper is based were gathered from June to September 1971 in six West African countries-Ghana, Upper Volta, Ivory Coast, Togo, Dahomey and Nigeria. The hypothesis was conceived during a 14-day, 1,576-mile journey by lorry and truck from Accra, Ghana to Ouagadougou, Upper Volta to Bobo-Dioulasso, Upper Volta to Wa, Ghana and back to Accra. It was more completely thought out, and various measures devised for testing it, in early July. Systematic participant-observation was then carried out on the behavior of lorry and truck drivers for the next two months by the direct practice of riding with the drivers as a paying passenger. Approximately 190 hours of actual in-the-vehicle travel were logged during the summer. This totaled 3,462 miles largely within a triangular area from Abidjan, Ivory Coast to Onitsha, Nigeria across the base and to Ouagadougou, Upper Volta at the apex. Appendix A details the route travelled. Approximately 870 miles, or 25% of the travel, was on dirt roads. Twelve consecutive days were devoted to riding in lorries based at the Central Lorry Park in Accra, Ghana and traveling outward distances of 25-35 miles twice per day. This allowed me to observe the behavior of a single driver for 4 hours, during which approximately half of his time was spent driving and half in other activities. This was done so that the observations would not be biased with long-haul trips of several hundred miles where opportunity for observation of drivers in other than .driving activity is reduced to approximately 207o of total time spent.",1978,Africa
Modeling of relationships between physical and technical activities and match outcome in elite German soccer players.,"BACKGROUND
The aim of this study was to determine what physical and technical activities of soccer players in different pitch positions affect significantly the match outcome of professional German soccer players; as well as to examine whether differences in physical and technical activities increase or reduce the probability of a match being won.


METHODS
The study sample comprised 4393 individual match observations of 350 soccer players competing in the Bundesliga during the 2014/2015 domestic season. Analysis was confined to outfield players (other than goalkeepers) who completed entire matches, and was carried out using the Impire AG motion analysis system. The selection of physical and technical activities to be used in predictive models was achieved using the lasso method.


RESULTS
The odds ratio revealed that an mean running speed in the second half that was greater by 0.1 km/h was associated with a 27.0% improvement in the odds of a match being won (OR=1.27; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.38) (forwards), 15.7% (OR=1.16; 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.23) (wide midfielders), and 10.0% (OR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.17) (central midfielders). Furthermore, in the case of wide midfielders, a significant variable was the distance covered at >24 km/h, with an increase of 0.1 km associated with odds of winning the game improved by 31.7% (OR=1.32; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.66).


CONCLUSIONS
Match outcome is affected significantly where peak and mean running speeds in the second half of the match are greater, and where longer distances are covered at speeds in excess of 24 km/h.",2019,The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness
Variable Selection and Estimation in High-dimensional Varying-coefficient Models.,"Nonparametric varying coefficient models are useful for studying the time-dependent effects of variables. Many procedures have been developed for estimation and variable selection in such models. However, existing work has focused on the case when the number of variables is fixed or smaller than the sample size. In this paper, we consider the problem of variable selection and estimation in varying coefficient models in sparse, high-dimensional settings when the number of variables can be larger than the sample size. We apply the group Lasso and basis function expansion to simultaneously select the important variables and estimate the nonzero varying coefficient functions. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the group Lasso selects a model of the right order of dimensionality, selects all variables with the norms of the corresponding coefficient functions greater than certain threshold level, and is estimation consistent. However, the group Lasso is in general not selection consistent and tends to select variables that are not important in the model. In order to improve the selection results, we apply the adaptive group Lasso. We show that, under suitable conditions, the adaptive group Lasso has the oracle selection property in the sense that it correctly selects important variables with probability converging to one. In contrast, the group Lasso does not possess such oracle property. Both approaches are evaluated using simulation and demonstrated on a data example.",2011,Statistica Sinica
Community Structure and Functional Gene Profile of Bacteria on Healthy and Diseased Thalli of the Red Seaweed Delisea pulchra,"Disease is increasingly viewed as a major factor in the ecology of marine communities and its impact appears to be increasing with environmental change, such as global warming. The temperate macroalga Delisea pulchra bleaches in Southeast Australia during warm summer periods, a phenomenon which previous studies have indicated is caused by a temperature induced bacterial disease. In order to better understand the ecology of this disease, the bacterial communities associated with threes type of samples was investigated using 16S rRNA gene and environmental shotgun sequencing: 1) unbleached (healthy) D. pulchra 2) bleached parts of D. pulchra and 3) apparently healthy tissue adjacent to bleached regions. Phylogenetic differences between healthy and bleached communities mainly reflected relative changes in the taxa Colwelliaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Thalassomonas and Parvularcula. Comparative metagenomics showed clear difference in the communities of healthy and diseased D. pulchra as reflected by changes in functions associated with transcriptional regulation, cation/multidrug efflux and non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. Importantly, the phylogenetic and functional composition of apparently healthy tissue adjacent to bleached sections of the thalli indicated that changes in the microbial communities already occur in the absence of visible tissue damage. This shift in unbleached sections might be due to the decrease in furanones, algal metabolites which are antagonists of bacterial quorum sensing. This study reveals the complex shift in the community composition associated with bleaching of Delisea pulchra and together with previous studies is consistent with a model in which elevated temperatures reduce levels of chemical defenses in stressed thalli, leading to colonization or proliferation by opportunistic pathogens or scavengers.",2012,PLoS ONE
"Compound Poisson point processes, concentration and oracle inequalities","This note aims at presenting several new theoretical results for the compound Poisson point process, which follows the work of Zhang et al. (Insur. Math. Econ. 59:325â€“336, 2014). The first part provides a new characterization for a discrete compound Poisson point process (proposed by AczÃ©l (Acta Math. Hung. 3(3):219â€“224, 1952)), it extends the characterization of the Poisson point process given by Copeland and Regan (Ann. Math. 37:357â€“362, 1936). Next, we derive some concentration inequalities for discrete compound Poisson point process (negative binomial random variable with unknown dispersion is a significant example). These concentration inequalities are potentially useful in count data regression. We give an application in the weighted Lasso penalized negative binomial regressions whose KKT conditions of penalized likelihood hold with high probability and then we derive non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for a weighted Lasso estimator.",2019,Journal of Inequalities and Applications
Bootstrap inference for penalized GMM estimators with oracle properties,"Abstract We study the validity of bootstrap methods in approximating the sampling distribution of penalized GMM estimators with oracle properties. More precisely, we focus on bridge estimators with Lq penalty for and adaptive lasso estimators. We show that the nonparametric bootstrap with recentered moment conditions provides a valid method for approximating the distribution of these estimators. Furthermore, using the bootstrap approach, we also propose a data-driven method for the selection of tuning parameters in the penalization terms. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the reliability and accuracy of the bootstrap procedure. The empirical coverages for the active variables implied by the nonparametric bootstrap are always very close to the nominal coverage probabilities.",2020,Econometric Reviews
Sparsity-based higher order ambisonics reproduction via LASSO,"The under-determined problem in Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA) makes it hard for larger accurate reproduction area especially at high frequencies. In this paper, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm is used to solve the problem by obtaining the sparse representation of the original plane wave field. The algorithm minimizes the squared error between the original and reproduced microphone signals with constraint on plane wave gains, so as to select a few nonzero plane wave gains for reproduction. Simulation results demonstrate that sparsity-based plane wave field reproduction via LASSO achieves small reproduction errors and outperforms basic decoding. In addition, fewer loudspeakers are active to reproduce the original field and have better performance.",2013,2013 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing
Vad berÃ¤ttar Midvinterblot,"Summary Midvinterblot Midwinter Sacrifice, meant to be the final element in Carl Larsson's decoration of the Naâ€tionalmuseum, shows the tragedy of a prehistoric Swedish king who, according to Snorre Sturlasson, was sacrificed for his people. The committee decided, however, not to recommend the execution of the picture which resulted in one of the most heated debates in the history of Swedish art. The conservative minister of Educational Affairs, K. G. Westman, was not happy with the decision and in 1915 called for pronouncements from artists and art historians, but Carl Larsson resolved the problem for him by resigning his commission. Nevertheless he executed the picture in oil on canâ€vas and it has been exhibited on the space once reserved for it in 1916, 1925â€“1931 and from 1992, by mere chance (?) periods of increasing chauvinism. While Carl Larsson in his first studies for the picture followed Snorre rather closely he succesively changed the iconography introducing a lapp shaman as the counterâ€part of ...",1995,Konsthistorisk tidskrift
Applying Penalized Binary Logistic Regression with Correlation Based Elastic Net for Variables Selection,"Reduction of the high dimensional classification using penalized logistic regression is one of the challenges in applying binary logistic regression. The applied penalized method, correlation based elastic penalty (CBEP), was used to overcome the limitation of LASSO and elastic net in variable selection when there are perfect correlation among explanatory variables. The performance of the CBEP was demonstrated through its application in analyzing two well-known high dimensional binary classification data sets. The CBEP provided superior classification performance and variable selection compared with other existing penalized methods. It is a reliable penalized method in binary logistic regression.",2015,Journal of Modern Applied Statistical Methods
First application of the â€˜lasso techniqueâ€™ on an endograft with suprarenal fixation stent,"The authors report the use of the â€˜lasso techniqueâ€™ for the preservation of bilateral renal artery patency, following the intraoperative proximal migration of an aortic endograft with suprarenal bare metal fixation and anchoring barbs, due to device delivery failure. During an emergency endovascular repair of a ruptured mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm using the Zenith Flex device, the main body of the graft migrated proximally to cover both renal arteries. Attempts to pull down the graft using balloons were not effective. Finally, the â€˜lasso techniqueâ€™ using a guidewire over the aortic bifurcation was employed and successfully adjusted the graft below the level of the renal arteries. No procedure-related complications were noted. The endovascular repair was used as a bridging procedure and two months following the primary endovascular procedure, open surgical repair of the infected aneurysm with excision of the stent graft was performed. The patient is alive after eight months follow-up.",2013,Vascular
Numerical Calculation for a Class of System of Multi-dimensional Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations,"In this paper, we propose the Galerkin finite element method for a class of the systemof multi-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equations (SMDNSE), and prove the existence ofthe generalized solution.

Parsimonious model identification via atomic norm minimization,"During the past few years a considerably research effort has been devoted to the problem of identifying parsimonious models from experimental data. Since this problem is generically non-convex, these approaches typically rely on relaxations such as Group Lasso or nuclear norm minimization. However, while these approaches usually work well in practice, there is no guarantee that using these surrogates will lead to the simplest model explaining the experimental data. In addition, incorporating stability constraints into the formalism entails a substantial increase in the computational complexity. Alternatively stability and model order constraints can be handled directly using a moments based approach. However, presently this approach is limited to relatively small sized problems, due to its computational complexity. Motivated by these difficulties, recently a new approach has been proposed based on the idea of representing the response of an LTI system as a linear combination of suitably chosen objects (atoms) and the observation that minimizing the atomic norm leads to sparse representations. In this paper we cover the fundamentals of this new approach and show that it leads to a very efficient algorithm, that avoids the need for using regularization steps and automatically incorporates stability constraints. In addition, this approach can be extended to accommodate non-uniform sampling and (unknown) initial conditions. These results are illustrated with several examples, including identification of a very lightly damped structure from time and frequency domain measurements.",2014,2014 European Control Conference (ECC)
[Noma and HIV infection: apropos of a case at the National Hospital Center in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso)].,"Noma (Cancrum oris) is a gangrenous stomatitis arising from a periodontal infection and leading to severe soft tissue and bone destruction. The pathology involves numerous factors including local thrombosis, vascularitis, necrotizing gingivitis, immunodeficiency, gram negative and anaerobic infection. It is usually a disease of infants and malnourished children in tropical areas often occurring after a debilitating disease like measles. Recently, cases have been reported in adults especially elderly patients or during immunodeficiency states. Reconstructive surgery is often necessary to deal with destruction and sequel but is rarely accessible in developing countries. We report one case of noma (cancrum oris) in an HIV seropositive patient at the National Hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso. The noma was inaugural of AIDS in a 40 years old labourer coming back from Ivory Coast and no major opportunistic infection was associated. The course was fulminant leading to extensive facial gangrene with recurrent bacterial infections. The disease was fatal in this depressive, malnourished and diarrhoeic patient despite local surgical treatment, prolonged antibiotherapy and supportive care.

Simultaneous estimation and variable selection in median regression using Lasso-type penalty,"We consider the median regression with a LASSO-type penalty term for variable selection. With the fixed number of variables in regression model, a two-stage method is proposed for simultaneous estimation and variable selection where the degree of penalty is adaptively chosen. A Bayesian information criterion type approach is proposed and used to obtain a data-driven procedure which is proved to automatically select asymptotically optimal tuning parameters. It is shown that the resultant estimator achieves the so-called oracle property. The combination of the median regression and LASSO penalty is computationally easy to implement via the standard linear programming. A random perturbation scheme can be made use of to get simple estimator of the standard error. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed method. We illustrate the methodology with a real example.",2010,Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics
UPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS combined with chemometrics establishes variations in chemical components in green tea from Yunnan and Hunan origins.,"Multi-components of green tea from different origins were identified by UPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS, including alkaloids, amino acids, catechins, flavones, flavone glycosides, phenolic acids and theaflavins. Quantitative chemical profiles of 72 samples of Yunnan green tea (YGT) and Hunan green tea (HGT) established the influence of origin on green tea. In addition, three variable selection methods, based on partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were employed to screen characteristic components of YGT and HGT. The results of variable importance on projection (VIP) method showed better performance than coefficients Î² and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for this dataset. Three characteristic components, named, gallocatechin gallate (GCG), epicatechin-(4Î²â€¯â†’â€¯8)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate, and vitexin were selected by VIP, with a correct rate of 98.61% and an AUC value of 0.9706.

Laparoscopic appendectomy using only two 5â€‰mm trocars,"SummaryBackgroundLaparoscopic appendectomy is now the standard and most surgeons use two 5â€‰mm and one 10â€“12â€‰mm port; the latter placed into the umbilicus. Various attempts have been made to reduce the number and sizes of ports for this procedure.Case reportAÂ 22-year-old male with acute right lower quadrant pain came to our emergency room. His white blood count (WBC) was 15000â€‰l/ml and on CT scan signs of acute appendicitis were found. He was taken to the operating room. His abdomen was accessed with aÂ Verres in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) and once pneumoperitoneum was established aÂ 5â€‰mm trocar was placed under visual control into the left lower quadrant (LLQ). AÂ phlegmonous appendix was found attached to the right abdominal wall. The Verres needle was exchanged for another 5â€‰mm trocar. AÂ Maryland grasper was used to bluntly create aÂ window between appendix base and mesoappendix. The appendiceal artery was dissected out and secured with aÂ 5â€‰mm clip and the mesoappendix was cut off the appendix. Two endoloops were lassoed around the appendix and tied at the appendix base and the specimen was amputated between the ties. The appendix was pulled with the distal tie towards the LUQ port, which was removed. The appendix base was grabbed with aÂ Kelly clamp and the specimen was pulled through the port site. Pneumoperitoneum was released and the LLQ port removed and the skin closed. The patient was discharged after 2Â h and had aÂ completely uneventful recovery.ConclusionIn selected cases with favorable anatomy, laparoscopic appendectomy with two 5â€‰mm ports may be possible. Miniaturizing this procedure while carefully weighing patient safety and costs should be aÂ goal for laparoscopic appendectomy.",2017,European Surgery
Extreme Rainfall Prediction using Bayesian Quantile Regression in Statistical Downscaling Modeling,"Abstract Statistical Downscaling (SD) is a model that uses satellite data from General Circulation Models (GCM), which in climatology are very useful in predicting climate for the next few decades. GCM data is generally ill-conditioned, which is high dimension and multicollinearity, so a special technique is needed to handle this poorly conditioned. One of the variable selection techniques and handling of multicollinearity which is currently highly developed is regularization techniques including Adaptive Lasso, where selective parameters are adaptive, which can differ for each regression coefficient. Until now, predictions of extreme rainfall in Indonesia have not used Adaptive Lasso in SD modeling. This paper aims to predict the amount of rainfall (in millimeters) at moderate extreme (quantile 0.75) and high extreme rainfall (quantile 0.9 da 0.95) and handling poorly conditioned GCM data with Adaptive Lasso techniques and building predictive models of local rainfall by utilizing GCM data using the Bayes quantile regression model. Response in the form of monthly rainfall at Indramayu district, West Java Indonesia, and 49 explanatory variables in the form of GCM precipitation data in the period January 1981 - December 2013, which handled multicollinearity and variable selection using the Adaptive Lasso.

Il est necessaire que des maintenant l'Afrique commence a s'organiser pour anticiper sa gestion de cette augmentation. Objectif: Reperer les personnes Ã¢gees en incapacites fonctionnelles et vivant a domicile a Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). Methodes: Nous avons conduit une etude descriptive transversale qui s'est deroulee a Bobo-Dioulasso aupres des personnes Ã¢gees d'au moins 60 ans. Le questionnaire PRISMA7 a ete utilise pour reperer les personnes Ã¢gees potentiellement en incapacites fonctionnelles et le Systeme de mesure de l'autonomie fonctionnelle (SMAF) a ete utilise pour evaluer le statut fonctionnel des personnes reperees. L'analyse des donnees a ete realisee a l'aide de Stata. Resultats: Un echantillon de 362 personnes Ã¢gees a ete interroge et 42% ont ete reperees comme etant potentiellement en incapacites fonctionnelles. Selon la combinaison PRISMA7 et SMAF (n = 351), la prevalence des incapacites moderees a graves etait de 25%. Cette prevalence variait de 7% (activites de la vie quotidienne) a 41 % (activite de la vie domestique) en passant par 10% (mobilite) et 25% (fonction mentale et communication). Discussion: En Afrique subsaharienne, peu d'etudes ont repere les personnes Ã¢gees en incapacites moderees a graves. Le taux de personnes reperees est superieur aux taux d'incapacites trouves dans la plupart des travaux realises en Afrique subsaharienne. Conclusion: Dans le contexte d'Afrique subsaharienne, PRISMA7 peut etre utilise comme outil de reperage des personnes Ã¢gees potentiellement en incapacites fonctionnelles.",2013,
A Long Non-coding RNA Signature to Improve Prognostic Prediction of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,"Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most aggressive solid malignant tumors worldwide. Increasing investigations demonstrate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression is abnormally dysregulated in cancers. It is crucial to identify and predict the prognosis of patients for the selection of further therapeutic treatment. Methods: PDAC lncRNAs abundance profiles were used to establish a signature that could better predict the prognosis of PDAC patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model was applied to establish a multi-lncRNA signature in the TCGA training cohort (N = 107). The signature was then validated in a TCGA validation cohort (N = 70) and another independent Fudan cohort (N = 46). Results: A five-lncRNA signature was constructed and it was significantly related to the overall survival (OS), either in the training or validation cohorts. Through the subgroup and Cox regression analyses, the signature was proven to be independent of other clinic-pathologic parameters. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis also indicated that our signature had a better predictive capacity of PDAC prognosis. Furthermore, ClueGO and CluePedia analyses showed that a number of cancer-related and drug response pathways were enriched in high risk groups. Conclusions: Identifying the five-lncRNA signature (RP11-159F24.5, RP11-744N12.2, RP11-388M20.1, RP11-356C4.5, CTC-459F4.9) may provide insight into personalized prognosis prediction and new therapies for PDAC patients.",2019,Frontiers in Oncology

Reef fish associations with sea urchins in an Atlantic oceanic island,"Many reef fish are known to be associated with particular microhabitats that provide food and refuge, such as branching corals, gorgonians, macroalgal beds and sea urchins. We investigate the association of reef fishes with the long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum in shallow reefs of Trindade Island, southeastern Brazil. A total of 1283 fish individuals from seven families and nine species were associated with 495 sea urchins. Sea urchins provide important shelter especially for juveniles of the Noronha wrasse, Thalassoma noronhanum. Larger fishes were found at higher densities associated to sea urchins with larger spines. At reefs lacking structurally complex organisms, such as branching corals, sea urchins can be an important refuge for juveniles or small-bodied reef fish species, influencing their distribution and acting as ecosystem engineers.",2017,Marine Biodiversity

Variable selection when confronted with missing data,"Variable selection is a common problem in linear regression. Stepwise methods, such as forward selection, are popular and are easily available in most statistical packages. The models selected by these methods have a number of drawbacks: they are often unstable, with changes in the set of variable selected due to small changes in the data, and they provide upwardly biased regression coefficient estimates. Recently proposed methods, such as the lasso, provide accurate predictions via a parsimonious, interpretable model. 
Missing data values are also a common problem, especially in longitudinal studies. One approach to account for missing data is multiple imputation. The simulation studies were conducted comparing the lasso to standard variable selection methods under different missing data conditions, including the percentage of missing values and the missing data mechanism. Under missing at random mechanisms, missing data were created at the 25 and 50 percent levels with two types of regression parameters, one containing large effects and one containing several small, but nonzero, effects. Five correlation structures were used in generating the data: independent, autoregressive with correlation 0.25 and 0.50, and equicorrelated again with correlation 0.25 and 0.50. Three different missing data mechanisms were used to create the missing data: linear, convex and sinister. 
Least angle regression performed well under all conditions when the true regression parameter vector contained large effects, with its dominance increasing as the correlation between the predictor variables increased. This is consistent with complete data simulations studies suggesting the lasso performed poorly in situations where the true beta vector contained small, nonzero effects. When the true beta vector contained small, nonzero effects, the performance of the variable selection methods considered was situation dependent. 
Ordinary least squares had superior performance in terms confidence interval coverage under the independent correlation structure and with correlated data when the true regression parameter vector consists of small, nonzero effects. A variety of methods performed well when the regression parameter vector consisted of large effects and the predictor variables were correlated depending on the missing data situation.",2006,
Accessibility and Consciousness â€“ Program and Abstracts,"s: KrystÃ¨le Appourchaux Should we end the debate about the distinction between access and phenomenal consciousness? The American philosopher Ned Block introduced in the 1 990s (Block, N. , 1 995) a famous distinction between access and phenomenal consciousness. The notion of phenomenal consciousness seems to be the most controversial notion in the dichotomy, especial ly for the advocates of the global workspace theory of consciousness (Kouider, S. , Sackur, J. et de Gardelle, V. , 201 2). However, I shal l argue that the two notions are problematic in the way Ned Block framed them, for both common sense and pragmatic reasons. First, the notion of access consciousness fal ls short of rendering the common sense definition of consciousness. I t brings confusion in that the â€œphilosophical zombieâ€ could be conscious in that sense. In other words, access on its own is not enough to capture the nature of conscious experience and might as well only refer to unconscious information processing. Block himself (Block, N. , 2007, 201 1 ) seems to have taken this into account when changing his original terminology into â€œcognitive accessâ€ on the one hand and â€œphenomenologyâ€ on the other, thereby avoiding the use of the term â€œconsciousnessâ€. However, Blockâ€™s notion of phenomenal consciousness is equally problematic in that his use of this term entails the possibi l ity for a subject to have â€œphenomenal experience [Q ] without knowing itâ€ (Block, N. 2001 ), which seems contradictory with the idea that phenomenality is the â€œwhat it is l ikeâ€ (Nagel, T. , 1 974) of experience. Phenomenal consciousness therefore seems (rightly) mysterious because it misses the exact goal for which it was introduced in the first place: namely, to explain why conscious experience seems to be richer than the verbal reports describing it. I wil l argue that even though the distinction has been useful in pointing towards a grey area in contemporary neuroscience and experimental psychology, it is now time for a change of conceptual framework in order to facil itate the experimental study of consciousness. Using both Anthony Jackâ€™s (1 999) advocacy of firstperson data and John Searleâ€™s (Searle, J. , 1 990, 1 992) criticism of a notion of consciousness which is l imited to cognitive access, I wil l offer a few leads for this change of framework and back them up with recent empirical findings (Petitmengin et al, 201 3) showing that, despite the l imitations of consciousness put forward by Nisbett and Wilson (1 977) and Johansson et al (2005), certain â€œpre-reflective statesâ€ â€“ although this terminology should be revised â€“ can actual ly become the object of precise verbal descriptions. Crucial ly, such descriptions are l ikely to al low for a better understanding of the phenomenology of consciousness and thereby useful ly complement the current experimental paradigms used in neuroscience and cognitive psychology. Ned Block Conscious, Preconscious, Unconscious A discussion of the categories of conscious, preconscious and unconscious with special reference to the â€œno-reportâ€ paradigm for consciousness research. Michael Graziano Consciousness and the social brain Neuroscientists understand the basic principles of how the brain processes information. But how does it become subjectively aware of at least some of that information? What is consciousness? In my lab we are developing a theoretical and experimental approach to these questions that we call the Attention Schema theory. The theory begins with attention, a mechanistic method of handling data. Some signals are enhanced at the expense of other signals and are more deeply processed. In the theory, the brain does more than just use attention. I t also constructs information â€“ incomplete, schematic, sometimes even inaccurate information â€“ about what attention is, what the consequences of attention are, and what its own attention is doing at any moment. This â€œattention schemaâ€ is used to help control attention, much as the â€œbody schema,â€ the brainâ€™s internal simulation of the body, is used to help control the body. This integrated set of information, the attention schema, incomplete and sometimes inaccurate as it is, forms the basis from which the brain concludes and reports that it has subjective awareness of things. The semi-magical, physical ly ethereal properties that we typical ly attribute to awareness are a product of the inaccuracies in that model. Moreover, we attribute awareness to others in a social context because it is useful to model the attentional states of others. Psychophysical evidence suggests that awareness does indeed act as the internal control model of attention, and imaging data suggests that some of the same brain regions involved in attributing awareness to others are also involved in attributing awareness to ourselves. An increasing set of studies therefore supports the Attention Schema theory. Anjana Jacob The epistemological basis of phenomenal consciousness Philosophical discussions of sensory states presume an understanding of what is distinctive about sensory information. A distinction is implicitly made between the sensory information in mental states and non-sensori ly encoded information they can be said to carry. A clear grasp of this distinction, I wil l argue, is vital but missing. I t turns out to be no easy task to provide it. But once we clearly articulate the distinction, I show that we are compelled to adopt an understanding of phenomenal character that is epistemological ly driven and which unifies the concepts of the sensory and the phenomenal. The distinction between phenomenal and access consciousness is then seen to be at best unhelpful, and at worst arising from a poor grasp of the fundamental distinction assumed between sensory and non-sensory information. The latterâ€™s critical significance here should not be surprising for access consciousness appeals to the rational control of action. Such a â€œrationalâ€ element must be etched in terms of what is epistemological ly non-sensory and it sets the backdrop against which we understand â€œthe phenomenalâ€. As my paper shows, phenomenal consciousness itself then turns out to be epistemological in character. Uriah Kriegel Phenomenality as the Categorical Basis of Accessibility As I see it, Ned Block's distinction between phenomenal and access consciousness originated as a powerful argument against the global workshop theory of consciousness, according to which consciousness is nothing but global accessibi l ity. In the first part of this talk, I wil l argue that the argument is decisive. In the second part, however, I wil l argue that it does not work against a neighboring thesis, namely, that the rigidified definite description ""the actual categorical basis of global accessibi l ity"" can serve as the reference-fixer of ""consciousness"" for the purposes of scientific theorizing about consciousness. Damiano La Manna The functional role of Blockean phenomenal consciousness Ned Block famously distinguished between access consciousness (A-consciousness) and phenomenal consciousness (P-consciousness). A mental state is A-conscious if its content can be accessed and used in the rational control of action, reasoning, etc. A mental state is Pconscious if there is something it is l ike for its subject to be in it. Uriah Kriegel has suggested that A-consciousness can be construed as (part of) the functional role of P-consciousness. But Kriegelâ€™s characterization of the latter departs from Blockâ€™s. Indeed, while Kriegel thinks that Pconsciousness can be explained in representational terms, Block does not. I argue that there is a way to preserve Blockâ€™s original characterization of P-consciousness as a nonrepresentational property, while endorsing Kriegelâ€™s proposal about its functional significance. This is by construing P-consciousness as a self-presentational property that does not harbor a distinction between awareness and experience, and by allowing it to carry representational content. Michael Lasso Phenomenology lost in empirical research In the study of consciousness, Ned Block (among others) claims that â€˜phenomenology overflows accessâ€™. This is to say that the phenomenology involved in any given stimulus is more â€˜richâ€™ and â€˜detai ledâ€™ than what our higher cognitive functions are capable of accessing. The problem is that his position in the controversy is not completely supported by the empirical research in visual perception. I focus primari ly on the 2003 Landman et al. study on visual perception and memory, specifical ly the storage capacity of working memory and iconic memory in visual perception. I argue that Blockâ€™s interpretation of the results of this study assumes a close association with iconic memory and phenomenology, and it rel ies too heavily on â€˜specific visual representationsâ€™ as the measurement of storage capacity of iconic memory. Not enough research has been done to directly support either of these points. Pascal Ludwig & Emile Thalabard The varieties of conscious access Lionel Naccache How â€˜Phenomenal Consciousnessâ€™ can be defined as a product of â€˜Conscious Accessâ€™ based constructs David Silverman Consciousness and cognitive access : A sensorimotor approach To explain consciousness natural istical ly, we must close two different explanatory gaps (Hurley and NoÃ«, 2003). The comparative gap is the problem of accounting natural istical ly for phenomenal qualities, the qualities that distinguish differing kinds of conscious experience from one another. Closing this gap requires us to explain, for example, why consciously seeing the colour red has the phenomenal quality associated with red and not blue. In addition to accounting for relatively specific types of awareness, such as seeing particular colours, closing the gap also requires us to account for the character of more general types, such as seeing (as opposed to hearing) or perceiving (as opposed to imagining). In addition to relatively specific qualitie",2015,
Structured Sparse Kernel Learning for Imaging Genetics Based Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis,"A kernel-learning based method is proposed to integrate multimodal imaging and genetic data for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. To facilitate structured feature learning in kernel space, we represent each feature with a kernel and then group kernels according to modalities. In view of the highly redundant features within each modality and also the complementary information across modalities, we introduce a novel structured sparsity regularizer for feature selection and fusion, which is different from conventional lasso and group lasso based methods. Specifically, we enforce a penalty on kernel weights to simultaneously select features sparsely within each modality and densely combine different modalities. We have evaluated the proposed method using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by both the clearly improved prediction accuracy and the discovered brain regions and SNPs relevant to AD.",2016,Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Network-Scale Traffic Modeling and Forecasting with Graphical Lasso and Neural Networks,"Traffic flow forecasting, especially the short-term case, is an important topic in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This paper does a lot of research on network-scale modeling and forecasting of short-term traffic flows. Firstly, we propose the concepts of single-link and multi-link models of traffic flow forecasting. Secondly, we construct four prediction models by combining the two models with single-task learning and multi-task learning. The combination of the multi-link model and multi-task learning not only improves the experimental efficiency but also the prediction accuracy. Moreover, a new multi-link single-task approach that combines graphical lasso (GL) with neural network (NN) is proposed. GL provides a general methodology for solving problems involving lots of variables. Using L1 regularization, GL builds a sparse graphical model making use of the sparse inverse covariance matrix. In addition, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a classic regression algorithm in Bayesian machine learning. Although there is wide research on GPR, there are few applications of GPR in traffic flow forecasting. In this paper, we apply GPR to traffic flow forecasting and show its potential. Through sufficient experiments, we compare all of the proposed approaches and make an overall assessment at last.",2012,arXiv: Learning

Estimation of building occupancy levels through environmental signals deconvolution,"We address the problem of estimating the occupancy levels in rooms using the information available in standard HVAC systems. Instead of employing dedicated devices, we exploit the significant statistical correlations between the occupancy levels and the CO2 concentration, room temperature, and ventilation actuation signals in order to identify a dynamic model. The building occupancy estimation problem is formulated as a regularized deconvolution problem, where the estimated occupancy is the input that, when injected into the identified model, best explains the currently measured CO2 levels. Since occupancy levels are piecewise constant, the zero norm of occupancy is plugged into the cost function to penalize non-piecewise constant inputs. The problem then is seen as a particular case of fused-lasso estimator by relaxing the zero norm into the â„“1 norm. We propose both online and offline estimators; the latter is shown to perform favorably compared to other data-based building occupancy estimators. Results on a real testbed show that the MSE of the proposed scheme, trained on a one-week-long dataset, is half the MSE of equivalent Neural Network (NN) or Support Vector Machine (SVM) estimation strategies.",2013,
Das deutsche Lied von Orlando di Lasso bis Johann Hermann Schein,"Als Georg Forster 1556 den letzten Band seiner Anthologie mit Beitragen namhafter Vertreter des deutschen Tenorliedes herausgab, ging damit diese genuin deutsche Liedtradition ihrem Ende entgegen. Mit Orlando di Lassos erster deutschsprachiger Liedammlung von 1567 begann sich schon bald ein neues deutsches weltliches Lied zu etablieren, fur das vor allem die italienischen Stilelemente aus Villanella, Canzonetta und Madrigal pragend wurden - wozu sich seit Jacob Regnarts Liedern ""nach Art der Neapolitanen oder Welschen Viallanellen"" (1574) die Liedsammlungen regelmasig auch in ihren Titeln bekannten. Dieser italienische Einfluss verhalf dem deutschen Lied einerseits wieder zum Anschluss an die bereits weiter entwickelte Musik im ubrigen Europa, andererseits durch Vermischung mit verbliebenen tradierten Stilelementen zu einer dennoch eigenen Identitat. Daruber hinaus spiegeln die Texte der Lieder die ersten Gehversuche der gerade zu jener Zeit erstmals aufkommenden deutschen Kunstlyrik wider und reprasentieren vielleicht sogar das Experimentierfeld zeitgenossischer, zumeist noch abwartend die Anonymitat bevorzugender, deutschsprachiger Dichter. Schlieslich markiert diese Epoche des deutschen Liedes auch den Aufbruch in die burgerliche Gesellschaft, in der die Kunstmusik nicht mehr allein dem Adel vorbehalten war, sondern - insbesondere uber burgerliche Musikgesellschaften, die moglichen Vorboten des spateren Konzertwesens - den Weg in die organisierte private Hausmusik fand. wesen 
 
When in 1556 Georg Forster published the last volume of his anthology of songs by significant representatives of the German Tenorlied, this genuine German song tradition was drawing to a close. With Orlando di Lasso's first German songbook having appeared in 1567, a new kind of German secular song began to evolve, the character of which was particularly determined by Italian stylistic elements from the genres of villanella, canzonetta and madrigal - which was even explicitly expresssed in the titles of most songbooks since Jacob Regnart's songs ""nach Art der Neapolitanen oder Welschen Viallanellen"" (1574). This Italian influence helped the German song to catch up again with the musical development in other European countries while, at the same time, preserving its unique identity by retaining some traditional elements from the Tenorlied. Apart from this, the song texts reflect the first attempts of German lyric poetry - which was about to emerge right at that time - and might even have constituted the playground for contemporary German poets, who possibly feared that their work would not be considered art and, therefore, preferred to remain anonymous. Finally, this epoch of the German song also represents the emergence into bourgeois society, in which art music was no longer reserved for the nobility, but became part of organized musical activities at private homes - especially in the form of bourgois musical associations, already heralding the professional concert business of later ages.",2006,

Utilizing RNA-Seq data for cancer network inference,"An important challenge in cancer systems biology is to uncover the complex network of interactions between genes (tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes) implicated in cancer. Next generation sequencing provides unparalleled ability to probe the expression levels of the entire set of cancer genes and their transcript isoforms. However, there are onerous statistical and computational issues in interpreting high-dimensional sequencing data and inferring the underlying genetic network. In this study, we analyzed RNA-Seq data from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from a population of 69 human individuals and implemented a probabilistic framework to construct biologically-relevant genetic networks. In particular, we employed a graphical lasso analysis, motivated by considerations of the maximum entropy formalism, to estimate the sparse inverse covariance matrix of RNA-Seq data. Gene ontology, pathway enrichment and protein-protein path length analysis were all carried out to validate the biological context of the predicted network of interacting cancer gene isoforms.",2012,Proceedings 2012 IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics (GENSIPS)
A multistage framework for dismount spectral verification in the VNIR,"A multistage algorithm suite is proposed for a specific target detection/verification scenario, where a visible/near infrared hyperspectral (HS) sample is assumed to be available as the only cue from a reference image frame. The target is a suspicious dismount. The suite first applies a biometric based human skin detector to focus the attention of the search. Using as reference all of the bands in the spectral cue, the suite follows with a Bayesian Lasso inference stage designed to isolate pixels representing the specific material type cued by the user and worn by the human target (e.g., hat, jacket). In essence, the search focuses on testing material types near skin pixels. The third stage imposes an additional constraint through RGB color quantization and distance metric checking, limiting even further the search for material types in the scene having visible color similar to the target visible color. Using the proposed cumulative evidence strategy produced some encouraging range-invariant results on real HS imagery, dramatically reducing to zero the false alarm rate on the example dataset. These results were in contrast to the results independently produced by each one of the suiteâ€™s stages, as the spatial areas of each stageâ€™s high false alarm outcome were mutually exclusive in the imagery. These conclusions also apply to results produced by other standard methods, in particular the kernel SVDD (support vector data description) and matched filter, as shown in the paper.",2013,
Assessing Methods of Analysis of Environmental Studies,"The quality of environmental impact statement (EIS) is assessed using tools that address both the formal and content aspects by the application of analysis methods. Although there are some common criteria, the methods have the possibility to address the specificities, resulting in a study conducted from each case. For example, the methodology of Lee and Colley (1999) was used to evaluate the quality of EIS in different countries. In Brazil, however, environmental agency determines, according to the terms of reference, the list of topics to be considered in the study, but the government does not check the quality of its contents. In this context, the present research evaluated the quality of the EIS Waste Treatment and Disposal Center of Caraguatatuba, Sao Paulo, Brazil using two different methodologies of analysis - Environmental Impact Statement Review Package (Glasson, Therivel and Cladwick, 2005) and Guide to Technical Analysis of EIS (Sanchez, 2008) - and compared the results that both methods provided. These results showed that both methods led similar conclusions about the quality of the study, classified as low. The gaps were about the analysis of alternatives, the methodology for assessing impacts and the proposing of mitigation measures and environmental programs. Also this suggested that this kind of methodologies could be useful on the EIS quality improvement by the consultants - working out - and the environmental agencies and can be applied as a systematic analysis tool related to impact system assessment of the Sao Paulo state.",2012,
Association of leukocyte DNA methylation changes with dietary folate and alcohol intake in the EPIC study,"BackgroundThere is increasing evidence that folate, an important component of one-carbon metabolism, modulates the epigenome. Alcohol, which can disrupt folate absorption, is also known to affect the epigenome. We investigated the association of dietary folate and alcohol intake on leukocyte DNA methylation levels in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Leukocyte genome-wide DNA methylation profiles on approximately 450,000 CpG sites were acquired with Illumina HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip measured among 450 women control participants of a case-control study on breast cancer nested within the EPIC cohort. After data preprocessing using surrogate variable analysis to reduce systematic variation, associations of DNA methylation with dietary folate and alcohol intake, assessed with dietary questionnaires, were investigated using CpG site-specific linear models. Specific regions of the methylome were explored using differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis and fused lasso (FL) regressions. The DMR analysis combined results from the feature-specific analysis for a specific chromosome and using distances between features as weights whereas FL regression combined two penalties to encourage sparsity of single features and the difference between two consecutive features.ResultsAfter correction for multiple testing, intake of dietary folate was not associated with methylation level at any DNA methylation site, while weak associations were observed between alcohol intake and methylation level at CpG sites cg03199996 and cg07382687, with qvalÂ =Â 0.029 and qvalÂ =Â 0.048, respectively. Interestingly, the DMR analysis revealed a total of 24 and 90 regions associated with dietary folate and alcohol, respectively. For alcohol intake, 6 of the 15 most significant DMRs were identified through FL.ConclusionsAlcohol intake was associated with methylation levels at two CpG sites. Evidence from DMR and FL analyses indicated that dietary folate and alcohol intake may be associated with genomic regions with tumor suppressor activity such as the GSDMD and HOXA5 genes.

As a former Ryder Cup player and one of the few players ever to shoot a 59 in a tour event (as he did in the 1991 Las Vegas Invitational) Beck has experienced what it's like to be completely in the groove and confident. On the flip-side, Beck also knows the psychological fallout of failing to make the cut several weeks in a row.In ""Focused for Golf,"" Beck teams with sport psychologist Wayne Glad to provide practical advice and mental training exercises proven to work for players on the PGA and Nike tours. Sprinkled throughout the book are Beck's and others' helpful insights and memorable experiences in dealing with the game's psychological ups and downs. Profiles of fellow pros Hale Irwin, Mike Reid, Mark Calcavecchia, Lee Janzen, Bill Glasson, Fred Funk, Ben Crenshaw, Bruce Lietzke, Kenny Perry, and others highlight just how much of golf is a head game. You'll learn how remarkably similar the pros' mental challenges are to your own, and how each one of them has used the ""Focused for Golf"" principles to overcome mentally challenging situations.Regardless of your handicap, ""Focused for Golf"" can help you remain confident, stay in control, thrive in competition, and keep your concentration on the course. How you think is often how you shoot. Play it smart-play better golf with the help of this comprehensive mental training manual.",1998,
Building prognostic and predictive models for cancer patients using expression modules and clinical variables.,"Abstract #5063 Background: Prognostication for breast cancer patients is improving, in part through the use of genomic predictors. However, most predictors only utilize one data type that is gene expression data, and thus prognostication that simultaneously uses multiple data types may result in even more accurate predictors.â€¨ Methods: We recently developed a unique risk of relapse predictor based upon a Cox proportional hazards model that contained gene expression (5 intrinsic subtypes) and clinical variables (tumor size and node status)(Parker ASCO 2008 abstract #11008). This model was accurate in predicting 7 year relapse probabilities and out performed the genomic or clinical variables only models. Building upon this combined genomic plus clinical parameters approach, we reasoned that including other expression modules indicative of pathway activation and cell type signatures might further improve our models. Therefore we build a collection of >200 expression modules using 1) unsupervised hierarchical and bi-clustering analysis 600 human tumors, 2) similar cluster analyses of 250 mouse mammary tumors, 3) >50 published breast tumor genomic profiles, and 4) signaling pathway activation modules derived from our own work. Each signature, or module, was then used with LASSO variable selection to determine if prognostic Cox Proportional Hazards models could be built using a local therapy and tamoxifen only treated patient set.â€¨ Results: These analyses show that highly significant prognostic models could be built for 1) all patients, 2) ER-positive patients, and 3) Luminal patients. Less predictive, yet significant models were created Basal-like patients, and no successful models could be developed for ER-negative patients, or for the expression-defined HER2-enriched subtype. For most significant predictors, the Cox model contained human-derived modules, mouse-derived modules, and pathology variables; for example the predictor for ER-positive patients contained human modules for proliferation, hypoxia, an embryonic stem cell derived signature, three mouse modules with one containing multiple metalloproteinases, tumor size and node status. In addition, the actual modules selected for the different patient subsets varied such that the modules selected for the Basal-like patients did not overlap any module selected for all patients, or for the ER-positive patient subset.â€¨ Conclusions: These analyses further reinforce the idea that breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and suggest that prognostic models for each important patient subset should be developed and used. Models that contain treatment variables, in addition to prognostic terms, are also being developed and will be presented. In summary, these analyses argue that the best prognostic algorithms for breast cancer patients contain biological variables coming for humans, from model systems, and from classic pathology.

"â€œI Will Make of My Scaffold, a Stageâ€: Performing the Asian American Subject in Maxine Hong Kingstonâ€™s Tripmaster Monkey: His Fake Book","Since Tripmaster Monkey: His Fake Book (1990) is a book about a book, writing about writing, it is no accident that its protagonist Wittman Ah Sing is an aspiring writer, working to discover his voice and style, and to create significant literature. This goal, however, is not easy to accomplish since his feelings of being misunderstood and rejected obstruct his ability to write meaningfully. While the novel is filled with moments that explore this creative struggle, one of Wittmanâ€™s early poems stands out as providing insight into his problems in writing. The poem is about a window-washer â€œclimb[ing] over the edge of a skyscraper, one leg at a time, onto his swing.â€ There is a sense of danger and vulnerability in what he is doing, even more so when he â€œunclutch[es] the ropes,â€ makes a noose, and contemplates suicide. Suddenly the window-washer is interrupted by â€œsky doggies,â€ followed by â€œa stampede of longhorns.â€ What he should do now is capture these airy creatures: â€œPoint the rope like a wand, whirl a MÃ¶bius strip, outline a buffalo. Shoot la riata sideways over the street, overhead at the helicopters, jump in and out of it, and lassoo one of those steers.â€ At the moment of his impending fall and death, he is able to corral the creature, which takes him â€œright off the plankâ€”but the harness holds,â€ rescuing Wittman. The poem ends with a declaration: â€œI vow: I will make of my scaffold, a stageâ€ (30). More than an ordinary window-washer, this central figure in the poem doubles as a poet and is so identified during his fall. His fall, then, is a metaphor for imaginative process, the animals representing the possible fruits of his imagination. While the flight leads to specific gainsâ€”he captures the steer, which symbolizes artistic achievementâ€”this is a risky moment as the poet teeters on the verge of death and the scene takes the reader to the instant before the poetâ€™s possible demise. Emblematic of Wittmanâ€™s artistic endeavors, the poem identifies a clear anxiety that writing can be deadly, that the writer risks his own annihilation in the act of writing. Given the novelâ€™s well-documented postmodern elements, this anxiety about writing may be attributed to textuality itself; postmodern theorists tell us that discourse is not a controllable entity but comprises shifting signifiers and meanings, making obsolete the idea of authorial intent, the singularity of the artistic product, and the concrete meaning of art. While the instability inherent in language and writing troubles the writerâ€™s position, this essay will focus on another basis of authorial anxiety in the novel: writing as an ethnic American in the United ......................................................................................................",2013,MELUS: Multi-Ethnic Literature of the U.S.
The C~*-algebra Generated by Strong Î˜-operators and Its K-theory,"The C~*-algebra generated by the strong Î˜-operator is considered in this paper. Thepaper contains two parts. The first part shows that the commutant ideal I(T) of C(T) is*isomorphic to where ?_n ??_(n+1), n = 1,2,â€¦and ?_n is * isomorphic to the n-matrix algebra over C_0(Z_0). In particular, when T is a completely nonnormal strong Î˜-operator, I(T) is * isomorphic to C_0(Z_0)(Ã—)K(I~2). The second part gives the equivalent con-ditions which make the spectrum and the approximate spectrum of the completely nonnormalstrong Î˜-operator identify and some K-groups of the C-algebra generated by this classoperator are computed in this part.",1989,
Analysis of Large Scale Power Systems via LASSO Learning Algorithms,"In this paper, a class of modern machine learning methods is utilized for estimating the transient stability boundary characterizing the large-scale power system grids. The boundary characteristic is viewed as a highly multidimensional response of power system variables. The proposed estimation methods based on various forms of the LASSO algorithm lead to simultaneous variable selection and function recovery yielding models of the reduced complexity. The obtained models have a clear interpretation and exhibit a smaller prediction error compared with known machine learning techniques used in the existing literature on modelling of large-scale power engineering systems. The performance of our method is assessed based on the real data generated from the 470-bus power system.",2019,
AF classification from a short single lead ECG recording: The PhysioNet/computing in cardiology challenge 2017,"The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge 2017 focused on differentiating AF from noise, normal or other rhythms in short term (from 9â€“61 s) ECG recordings performed by patients. A total of 12,186 ECGs were used: 8,528 in the public training set and 3,658 in the private hidden test set. Due to the high degree of inter-expert disagreement between a significant fraction of the expert labels we implemented a mid-competition bootstrap approach to expert relabeling of the data, levering the best performing Challenge entrants' algorithms to identify contentious labels. A total of 75 independent teams entered the Challenge using a variety of traditional and novel methods, ranging from random forests to a deep learning approach applied to the raw data in the spectral domain. Four teams won the Challenge with an equal high F1 score (averaged across all classes) of 0.83, although the top 11 algorithms scored within 2% of this. A combination of 45 algorithms identified using LASSO achieved an F1 of 0.87, indicating that a voting approach can boost performance.",2017,2017 Computing in Cardiology (CinC)
Roleoftheconservedleucines intheleucine zipper dimerization motif ofyeastGCN4,"YeastGCN4 belongs totheclassofeukaryotic transcription factors whosebZIPDNA-binding domains dimerize viaaleucine zipper motif thatstructurally resembles acoiled coil. Theleucine zipper contains 4-5highly conserved leucine residues spaced exactly 7residues apart thatarelocated within thea-helical hydrophobic interface betweenprotein monomers. Here,we investigate theroleofthefourcanonical leucines intheGCN4leucine zipper byanalyzing a series ofmutated derivatives fortheir ability toactivate transcription invivo andtobindDNAinvitro. TheGCN4 leucine zipper issurprisingly tolerant ofmutations, with awidevariety ofsingle substitutions atanyofthefour leucines including basicandacidic aminoacids behaving indistinguishably fromwild-type GCN4. Moreover, somederivatives containing twoleucine substitutions display detectable thoughreduced function. Theseresults indicate thatother residues withinthecoiledcoilarecrucial forefficient dimerization, andtheysuggest thatsomeeukaryotic transcriptional regulatory proteins lacking the conserved leucine repeat willdimerize through a structurally homologous motif. Interestingly, our results differ inseveral respects fromthose obtained byanalyzing mutations intheGCN4leucine zipper in thecontext ofaXrepressor-GCN4 zipper hybrid protein. Theseapparent differences mayreflect afunctional interrelationship between theleucine zipper andbasic region subdomains forDNA-binding bybZIPproteins.",1992,

GABAergic influences on ORX receptor-dependent abnormal motor behaviors and neurodegenerative events in fish.,"At date the major neuroreceptors i.e. gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)R) and orexin (ORXR) systems are beginning to be linked to homeostasis, neuroendocrine and emotional states. In this study, intraperitoneal treatment of the marine teleost Thalassoma pavo with the highly selective GABA(A)R agonist (muscimol, MUS; 0.1 microg/g body weight) and/or its antagonist bicuculline (BIC; 1 microg/g body weight) have corroborated a GABA(A)ergic role on motor behaviors. In particular, MUS induced moderate (p<0.05) and great (p<0.01) increases of swimming towards food sources and resting states after 24 (1 dose) and 96 (4 doses) h treatment sessions, respectively, when compared to controls. Conversely, BIC caused a very strong (p<0.001) reduction of the former behavior and in some cases convulsive swimming. From the correlation of BIC-dependent behavioral changes to neuronal morphological and ORXR transcriptional variations, it appeared that the disinhibitory action of GABA(A)R was very likely responsible for very strong and strong ORXR mRNA reductions in cerebellum valvula and torus longitudinalis, respectively. Moreover these effects were linked to evident ultra-structural changes such as shrunken cell membranes and loss of cytoplasmic architecture. In contrast, MUS supplied a very low, if any, argyrophilic reaction in hypothalamic and mesencephalic regions plus a scarce level of ultra-structural damages. Interestingly, combined administrations of MUS+BIC were not related to consistent damages, aside mild neuronal alterations in motor-related areas such as optic tectum. Overall it is tempting to suggest, for the first time, a neuroprotective role of GABA(A)R inhibitory actions against the overexcitatory ORXR-dependent neurodegeneration and consequently abnormal swimming events in fish.",2010,Toxicology and applied pharmacology
Reverse passage of the suture lasso in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.,"Suture passage in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair can be technically difficult. The suture lasso is typically passed antegrade from the bursal side of the rotator cuff. Antegrade passage of the suture lasso can be particularly difficult when visualization is limited. Reverse passage of the suture lasso from the undersurface can be used to place sutures in technically challenging circumstances. The suture lasso is placed retrograde through the undersurface of the rotator cuff and used as a suture shuttle to bring sutures back through the rotator cuff. This technique is easily reproducible and cost-effective, and it requires only 2 working arthroscopy portals.",2009,American journal of orthopedics
Rank-based group variable selection,"A robust rank-based estimator for variable selection in linear models, with grouped predictors, is studied. The proposed estimation procedure extends the existing rank-based variable selection [Johnson, B.A., and Peng, L. (2008), â€˜Rank-based Variable Selectionâ€™, Journal of Nonparametric Statistics, 20(3):241â€“252] and the ww-scad [Wang, L., and Li, R. (2009), â€˜Weighted Wilcoxon-type Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation Methodâ€™, Biometrics, 65(2):564â€“571] to linear regression models with grouped variables. The resulting estimator is robust to contamination or deviations in both the response and the design space.The Oracle property and asymptotic normality of the estimator are established under some regularity conditions. Simulation studies reveal that the proposed method performs better than the existing rank-based methods [Johnson, B.A., and Peng, L.
