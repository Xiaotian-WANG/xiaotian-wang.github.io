Liver- and Microbiome-derived Bile Acids Accumulate in Human Breast Tumors and Inhibit Growth and Improve Patient Survival.,"PURPOSE
Metabolomics is a discovery tool for novel associations of metabolites with disease. Here, we interrogated the metabolome of human breast tumors to describe metabolites whose accumulation affects tumor biology.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We applied large-scale metabolomics followed by absolute quantification and machine learning-based feature selection using LASSO to identify metabolites that show a robust association with tumor biology and disease outcome. Key observations were validated with the analysis of an independent dataset and cell culture experiments.


RESULTS
LASSO-based feature selection revealed an association of tumor glycochenodeoxycholate levels with improved breast cancer survival, which was confirmed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Absolute quantification of four bile acids, including glycochenodeoxycholate and microbiome-derived deoxycholate, corroborated the accumulation of bile acids in breast tumors. Levels of glycochenodeoxycholate and other bile acids showed an inverse association with the proliferation score in tumors and the expression of cell cycle and G2/M checkpoint genes, which was corroborated with cell culture experiments. Moreover, tumor levels of these bile acids markedly correlated with metabolites in the steroid metabolism pathway and increased expression of key genes in this pathway, suggesting that bile acids may interfere with hormonal pathways in the breast. Lastly, a proteome analysis identified the Complement & Coagulation Cascade as being up-regulated in glycochenodeoxycholate-high tumors.


CONCLUSIONS
We describe the unexpected accumulation of liver- and microbiome-derived bile acids in breast tumors. Tumors with increased bile acids show decreased proliferation, thus fall into a good prognosis category, and exhibit significant changes in steroid metabolism.",2019,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research
Machine learning-based prediction of response to PARP inhibition across cancer types.,"PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are FDA approved for the treatment of BRCA1/2 deficient breast and ovarian cancer, but a growing body of pre-clinical evidence suggests the drug class holds therapeutic potential in other cancer types, independent of BRCA1/2 status. Large-scale pharmacogenomic datasets offer the opportunity to develop predictors of response to PARPis in many cancer types, expanding their potential clinical applicability. Response to the PARPi olaparib was used to identify a multi-gene PARPi response signature in a large in vitro dataset including multiple cancer types, such as breast, ovarian, pancreatic, lung cancer, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, using machine learning approaches. The signature was validated on multiple independent in vitro datasets, also testing for response to another PARPi, rucaparib, as well as two clinical datasets using the cisplatin response as a surrogate for PARPi response. Finally, integrative pharmacogenomic analysis was performed to identify drugs which may be effective in PARPi resistant tumors. A PARPi response signature was defined as the 50 most differentially transcribed genes between PARPi resistant and sensitive cell lines from several different cancer types. Cross validated predictors generated with LASSO logistic regression using the PARPi signature genes accurately predicted PARPi response in a training set of olaparib treated cell lines (80-89%), an independent olaparib treated in vitro dataset (66-77%), and an independent rucaparib treated in vitro dataset (80-87%). The PARPi signature also significantly predicted in vitro breast cancer response to olaparib in another separate experimental dataset. The signature also predicted clinical response to cisplatin and survival in human ovarian cancer and osteosarcoma datasets. Robust transcriptional differences between PARPi sensitive and resistant tumors accurately predict PARPi response in vitro and cisplatin response in vivo for multiple tumor types with or without known BRCA1/2 deficiency. These signatures may prove useful for predicting response in patients treated with PARP inhibitors.",2019,medRxiv
El concepto aristotÃ©lico de la imitaciÃ³n en el Renacimiento de las letras espaÃ±olas: siglo XVI,"La imitacion aristotelica, como la entendemos hoy dia, fue una idea sumamente avanzada para su tiempo. Por esta razon no nos extrana que la Poetica de Aristoteles no haya ejercido sino una leve influencia sobre la antiguedad clasica. No hay ninguna aparente referencia a ella en las poeticas de Horacio, Ciceron o Quintiliano. Asimismo la obra parece haber estado casi completamente perdida para los eruditos de la Edad Media. Ya sea desconociendo la teoria de la imitacion aristotelica, o guardando silencio sobre ella, los clasicos grecorromanos de la antiguedad desarrollaron su propio concepto de la imitacion, al que se ha llamado concepto retorico, horadarlo o ciceroniano. Esta nocion clasica descansaba mas en la practica de estudiar con cuidado las obras de autores conocidos y respetados para imitar la manera en que se expresaban. No obstante, los mejores escritores antiguos insistian en la originalidad como fin ideal. En Espana en la mayor parte del siglo xvi no existio casi una preocupacion teorico-literaria como la que se fomento en Italia. Menendez Pelayo da muestras de que en Espana hacia 1530 se aceptaba el concepto retorico, horaciano o ciceroniano de la imitacion al observar que ""la introduccion de los metros italianos se verificosin resistencia alguna que tuviera verdadero caracter crit ico.. ."" Nos explica que la penetracion del dolce stil nuovo en la peninsula se facilito porque solo se trataba de sustituir una imitacion con otra. Juan Luis Vives confirma la afirmacion de Menendez Pelayo y, a la vez, nos informa que el mismo, Vives, aprobaba solo el mejor concepto de la imitacion retorica. Juan de Valdes ejemplifica la falta de interes en la teoria literaria entre los espanoles. Como se ve en su Dialogo de la lengua (1547), Valdes se preocupa mas por sistematizar el idioma y menos por problemas teoricos. No se interesa en la imitacion como teoria sino en sus resultados: la verosimilitud y el decoro renacentista. Aun en la segunda mitad del siglo Francisco Sanchez de las Brozas, el Brocense, defiende el concepto retorico de la imitacion. Limita su comentario sobre las Obras del Excelente Poeta Garci Lasso de la Vega. Con Anotaciones y enmiendas del Licenciado francisco Sanchez Cathedratico de Rhetorica en Salamanca (1574) casi exclusivamente a una busqueda de fuentes. Como consecuencia del trabajo del Brocense, hubo quien acusara a Garciiaso de falta de originalidad. A pesar de esto, Sanchez de las Brozas insistio en su punto de vista afirmando que no tenia por buen poeta al que no imitara a los excelentes antiguos. El ano 1580 fue decisivo para Espana en el sentido de que se nota un cambio en la preocupacion por lo teorico entre los peritos de la epoca; ademas, este es el ano en que aparecen en Espana ciertos aspectos de la teoria imitativa de Aristoteles. La primera poetica existente hoy impresa en Espana durante el siglo xvi es la de Miguel Sanchez de Lima, Ei Arte Poetica en Romance Castellano (1580); si se escribieron poeticas anteriores a esta, se han perdido. En su obra, aunque no rechaza del todo el concepto de la imitacion retorica, Sanchez de Lima sostiene una idea ya muy popular en ese entonces: el concepto de que cuando se escribe poesia, es mas importante el talento natural del poeta que el estudio de los antiguos clasicos. En el mismo ano en que escribio Sanchez de Lima su trabajo, Francisco de Medina, uno de los humanistas mas respetados de Espana, le contradice. Medina redacto un prologo a las Obras de Garci Lasso dela Vega con anotaciones de Fernando de Herrera (1580). En el breve preambulo trata de explicar por que a los escritores espanoles de la epoca les falta la debida erudicion y, a la vez, demuestra compartir el mismo concepto retorico de la imitacion que expresaba el Brocense porque Medina reconoce que parte del proposito del autor Fernando de Herrera en sus Anotaciones, constituye un esfuerzo para iluminar las obras de Garciiaso de modo que se pueda imitar al toledano con seguridad. Sin embargo, es Fernando de Herrera, el estudioso renacentista, quien demuestra desarrollar mas el concepto de la imitacion retorica. En su obra citada anteriormente, desarrolla el concepto de sus antecesores y el de los mejores escritores grecorromanos. Afirma que cuando el concepto retorico de la imitacion se aplica a la poesia, debe hacerse con cuidado; antes de hacerlo, es necesario haber contemplado los mejores modelos de la antiguedad clasica y anade que tambien hay que tener en cuenta los ejemplos de los italianos. El poeta, segun Herrera, esta obligado a recrear, pues no conviene que se haga una pura repeticion de los modelos escogidos; es decir, el estudio de los autores clasicos sirve solo como punto de partida para encontrar nuevos modos y formas de hermosura. Ademas de defender el mejor concepto de la imitacion retorica, Herrera se adelanta y da muestras de tener cierto entendimiento del concepto aristotelico de la mimesis. Siendo critico y, a la vez, poeta, le interesan las ideas concretas con las cuales puede juzgar la obra creadora. Manifiesta, por ejemplo, que esta familiarizado con un aspecto importantisimo de la teoria: la idea de que el critico debe concentrar su animo en la obra y no en los elementos que el artista imita. Siguiendo las palabras de Aristoteles, declara que""es mas importante juzgar el valor estetico de la imitacion que inexactitudes en la representacion de la realidad, las cuales resultan menos graves. La afirmacion tiene consecuencias trascendentales para la obra artistica, pero especialmente para una epoca como la dej Renacimiento espanol cuando no faltaban moralistas que menospreciaran la obra de ficcion sobre la base de la etica, criterio que no tiene nada que ver con el arte.

"Reinventing Childhood after World War II. Paula S. Fass, and Michael Grossberg, Eds. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012.","Reinventing Childhood after World War II. Paula S. Fass, and Michael Grossberg, Eds. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012. Reinventing Childhood after World War II, a collection of seven essays edited by Paula S. Fass and Michael Grossberg, is a welcome addition to the growing body of study exploring attitudes toward childhood and influences on children's lives. In their preface, Fass and Grossberg acknowledge the ""centrality of children and childhood to fundamental matters of law, social policy, politics and political symbolism, institutional life, and cultural production"" (x), noting how children's lives changed dramatically after World War II. ""Studying children"" they contend, ""is crucial to understanding the complex developments of the [postwar] period,"" a period that has been a ""distinct and extraordinarily rich episode"" for the United States specifically and the West more generally (xi). One of the key themes in this volume is childrearing. In the volume's first essay, Fass reflects on the changing demographics of the American family, characterized by ""new gender roles, sexual behaviors and mores, marriage patterns, divorce trends, and birth rates"" (11). She argues that in earlier eras, ""child-centered"" referred to parents' encouragement to their children to be independent and chart their own lives. By the 1950s that began to change as Americans took greater control over their children's affairs, ""circumscribing their range of choices, patrolling their behavior, and supervising their activities"" (11). The ramifications were stunning. Greater parental involvement led to more organized activities and less free time, more pressure for success and perfection, greater use of drugs to control behavior, more monitoring due to safety concerns - and ultimately more adolescent rebellion. The volume's second essay - in which coeditor Grossberg argues that America is embroiled in a clash regarding children's rights - logically flows from Fass's themes. According to Grossberg, ""liberationists"" support granting youths more autonomy in matters related to education, health, welfare, and decisionmaking, while ""caretakers"" support legislation designed to protect children and teens, subsequently limiting their autonomy. The next two essays in the book address differences in children's lives during and after the Cold War caused by changes in average family size, gender roles, consumer practices, media use, and technological advancements. Whereas many speak glowingly of American childhood in the 1 950s, Steven Mintz argues that the era, with its bullying, racial prejudices, and gender stereotypes, need not be sugar-coated. While Mintz addresses ideology, Stephen Lassonde focuses on child development and marketers' practice of blurring age boundaries to increase profitability. â€¦",2012,The Journal of American Culture

Allogeneic HY Antibodies 3 Months Following Sex-Mismatched HCT Predicts Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease and Non-Relapse Mortality,"![Graphic][1] 

Background B-cells play a significant role in chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). Male patients with female donors (Fâ†’M) are at a higher risk of developing cGVHD. B cell responses against minor histocompatibility antigens encoded on the Y chromosome, called H-Y antigens, develop following Fâ†’M HCT patients in association with cGVHD (Miklos, Blood. 2005 & Sahaf, PNAS. 2013). Here we present our novel HY microarray and use this sensitive technology to determine temporal development of HY antibody (Ab) preceding cGVHD. Multivariate analyses demonstrate that HY-Ab detection 3 months (3m) post HCT predicts cGHVD incidence and non-relapse mortality (NRM).

Methods We studied 136 adult male recipients of Fâ†’M HCT between 2005 and 2012 who survived without relapse for at least 3m post-HCT with 3m plasma available. Median patient age was 53 (21-74). Related donors were transplanted in 85 (63%) and 128 (94%) were PBSC grafts. Reduced intensity conditioning accounted for 61 (45%) and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) was used in 71 (52%). Thirty-one patients (23%) experienced grade II-IV acute GVHD.

We measured IgG against six HY antigens (DBY, UTY, ZFY, SMCY, EIF1AY, and RBS4Y) from plasma collected 3m post-HCT using a novel proteomic microarray here presented for the first time. The cut-off value for seropositivity was defined as the third quartile + 2x the interquartile range, determined from plasma of 60 male donors. HY-score was defined as the cumulative number of HY antigen targeted by Abs at 3m post-HCT.

Results The frequencies of HY antigen-specific Ab are presented in [Table 1][2], showing that SMCY and UTY were most frequently detected and overall, 78 (57%) had developed allo-Ab against any of these 6 HY antigens. Each HY-Ab was significantly associated with the development of cGVHD and DBY was greatest. LASSO analysis suggested that DBY, UTY, and ZFY were the most predictive for the development of cGVHD ([Table 1][2]). Univariate analysis failed to identify associations between clinical features and the development of HY-Ab at 3m. The detection of HY-Ab gradually increased within the 1st year post HCT and seropositivity for each HY-IgG (except RPS4Y) persisted.

Considering each HY-IgG response by principal component analysis, a higher HY-score was associated with an increased risk for the development of cGVHD and NRM, after adjusting for usual alloHCT clinical factors ([Table 2][3]). In addition, the severity of cGVHD was significantly associated with the HY-score: the proportion of severe/moderate cGVHD was 33% in 0, 30% in 1, 60% in 2-3, and 70% in 4-6 (P<0.01).

View this table:

Table 1. 

View this table:

Table 2. 

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that HY-score in combination with clinical factors enhanced the predictive potential for the development of cGVHD [area under the curve (AUC): 0.76], in comparison with either of only HY-score (AUC: 0.66) or clinical factors (AUC: 0.69).

Conclusion Here, we show that HY Ab detection 3m following sex-mismatch HCT actually predicts the development of cGVHD, independently from clinical risk factors. In addition, the combination of HY-score and clinical factors had a greater predictive potential than clinical factors alone for the development of cGVHD in Fâ†’M HCT. HY-Ab development 3m post HCT may stratify cGVHD risk and support B-cell-depletion therapy beginning 3 months or earlier to prevent cGVHD development.

Quentin Meillassoux and Radical (Im)possibility of Art Kristupas Sabolius Abstract This paper addresses the problematic relationship between Speculative Realism and art. Although the newly-born movement became popular among curators and artists, one finds no space left for legitimization of creative practices in Quentin Meillassouxâ€™s â€œAfter Finitudeâ€. By criticizing the so-called correlationism which privileges the necessary binding between being and thinking, Speculative Realism would not grant art a possibility of the access to the reality of things-in-themselves. By creating something new, artistic practices constantly violate the absolute autonomy of the world. On the other hand, if rejected the reductive rationalism of speculation, the principle of â€œthe necessity of contingencyâ€, as postulated by Meillassoux, could provide some guidelines for artistic take on the issue of reality. Through the radicalization of contingency in creative practices and the restitution of the value of the virtual, one could perform the transformation into Otherness and not-speculative confrontation with the realm of Hyper-Chaos.

On the Duality between Network Flows and Network Lasso,"The data arising in many application domains have an intrinsic network structure. Such network structure is computationally apprealing due to the availability of highly scalable graph algorithms. An important class of graph algorithms is related to optimizing network flows. This paper explores the duality of network flow methods and the recently proposed network Lasso. Network Lasso extends the Lasso method from sparse linear models to clustered graph signals. It turns out that the computational and statistical properties of network Lasso crucially depends on the existence of sufficiently large network flows. Using elementary tools from convex analysis, we offer a precise characterization of the duality between network Lasso and a minimum cost network flow problem. This duality provides a strong link between network Lasso methods and network flow algorithms.",2019,ArXiv
The impact of the interplay between nonionics and the cell membrane on the nanoparticle-cell association and stability of Caco-2 cells,"Nanopartikel (NP) sind etwa 10- 100mal kleiner als eine Eukaryontenzelle und konnen in diese aufgenommen werden. Bei Aufnahmestudien werden derzeit werden Fluoreszenz-markierte NP eingesetzt, die durch Ausbluten des Farbstoffes falsch positive Ergebnisse vorpsiegeln konnen. Als Alternative zur Markierung wurde die Anderung der Rauheit der Zelloberflache durch Bindung und Aufnahme von NP im Durchfluszytometer untersucht. Basiertend auf Vergleichsstudien mit fluoreszenz-markierten NP konnte die Zellgranularitat als ein zusatzlicher Parameter fur Zytoadhasion und Zytoinvasion von biomimetischen NP etabliert werden. 
 
Obwohl NP in Zellen aufgenommen werden konnen ist die Aufnahmerate fur einen therapeutischen Nutzen oftmals zu gering. Um diesem Problem Rechnung zu tragen wurde der Einfluss der nichtionogenen Tenside Poloxamer 188, Polysorbat 20 und Polysorbat 80 auf die Wechselwirkung von fluoreszierenden NP und Caco-2 Einzelzellen im Durchflusszytometer untersucht. Poloxamer 188 konnte als atoxisch bewertet werden und erhohte die NP-Zell Assoziation sogar in Mengen, die produktionsbedingt in NP enthalten sind. In Gegenwart von freiem Poloxamer 188 nahm die Zellassoziation der NP mit steigender Konzentration zu. Im Gegensatz dazu verbesserten oder inhibierten Polysorbat 20 und Polysorbat 80 die NP-Zell Wechselwirkung in Abhangigkeit von deren Konzentration. Daruber hinaus wurden zytotoxische Effekte der Polysorbate beobachtet. Mit Hilfe der Mikroaspirationstechnik konnte eine zunehmende Steifigkeit der Zellmembran in Gegenwart von Poloxamer 188 nachgewiesen werden. Die erhohte NP-Zell Assoziation durfte daher auf der Unterdruckung der Wellenbewegung der Zellmembran und der damit erhohten Kontaktfrequenz zwischen NP und Zelloberflache beruhen. 
 
Inwieweit die erhohte Steifigkeit der Zellmembran in Gegenwart von Poloxamer 188 die Kryokonservierung von empfindlichen Zelllinien vorteilhaft ist, wurde durch Proliferationstests nach dem Tauen von kryokonservierten Caco-2 Zellen untersucht. Verglichen mit herkommlichen Frier-Tau-Protokollen bewirkte Poloxamer 188 eine deutlich erhohte Wachstumsrate von Caco-2 Zellen.",2010,
El Madrid de Julio Cano Lasso. De la utopÃ­a a la realidad,"espanolEn el libro La ciudad y su paisaje, que el autor define como muy alejado del urbanismo, Julio Cano recoge sus reflexiones sobre la ciudad historica por medio del estudio de varias ciudades espanolas analizadas a traves de numerosos dibujos. Destaca la importancia dada a la ciudad de Madrid en dos vertientes: su relacion con el paisaje circundante mediante su fachada urbana volcada sobre el rio Manzanares, y su paisaje interior, ejemplificado por la escena urbana formada por las calles Gran Via y Alcala. En el libro se entremezclan analisis de la situacion historica y actual de los conjuntos madrilenos con propuestas de actuacion para ellos. Estas propuestas, como el parque lineal para el Manzanares o la ampliacion del Ministerio de Marina, resultan muy similares a actuaciones construidas con posterioridad en los mismos escenarios de la ciudad como son Madrid Rio y la ampliacion del Banco de Espana de Rafael Moneo. En esta investigacion se analizan las convergencias y divergencias, metodologicas y morfologicas, entre las propuestas teoricas de Julio Cano y los proyectos construidos referidos anteriormente. Se pretende poner en valor los planteamientos urbanos de Julio Cano Lasso, y su consideracion de la ciudad como la mas importante creacion humana.

It is stricking the importance given to the city of Madrid in two ways: its relationship with the surrounding landscape through its urban facade overturned on the Manzanares River, and its interior landscape, exemplified by the urban scene formed by the Gran Via and Alcala streets. The book analyzes the historical and current status of these urban ensembles of Madrid and also suggests possible lines of action in them. These proposals, such as the Linear Park of Manzanares River or the Ministry of Marine extending, are very similar to urban projects actually built in the city some years later, as Madrid Rio and the Bank of Spain expansion of Rafael Moneo. In this research we analize the convergences and divergences, both methodological and morphological, between Julio Canoâ€™s theoretical proposals and those real projects. It aims to focus on Julio Cano Lassoâ€™s urban approaches and his consideration of the city as the most important of human creations.",2014,
Early Jurassic pillow lavas and palynomorphs in the Karoo of eastern Botswana,"Volcanic rocks in conformable contact with fossiliferous sedimentary strata apparently present excellent possibilities for the calibration of the stratigraphical record by radiometric age determination. Unfortunately, many continental sedimentary sequences are poor in zone fossils. For example, correlation of the desert sediments in the upper Karoo Sequence of southern Africa relies on broad lithostratigraphical divisions1 although vertebrate fossils can also be used2 in some areas. However, precise dating of the onset of Karoo vulcanicity is crucial to the description of Gondwanaland. Here we note a highly exceptional area in eastern Botswana where the top of the largely aeolian â€˜Cave Sandstoneâ€™ and the base of the overlying â€˜Stormberg Lavasâ€™ can be dated by the combined use of palaeontological and radiometric methods. Fluvio-lacustrine sediments within the lowest Stormberg Lavas are conformably overlain by basalts (in places, pillow lavas) with a probable Kâ€“Ar minimum age of âˆ¼181 Myr. Early Jurassic palynomorphs (Classopollis intrareticulatus) suggest that the maximum age of these sediments is in the Upper Sinemurian, between âˆ¼195 and 200 Myr.",1984,Nature

We focus on decreasing the required number of measurements to detect all congested links in the required number of measurements to detect all congested links in the context of network tomography.

Analysis of Influence of Cable Damage on Dynamic Characteristics of one Cable-stayed Bridge,"Taking a super cable-stayed bridge as background and combining with the original design information,a bridge calculation model is set up based on finite element program to simulate influence of cable damage on dynamic characteristics.The law of the dynamic characteristics with different damage is studied through the decrease of the lasso effective area.It can be conclude that the influence of cable damage has bigger influence to vertical bending mode than that on lateral bending and twisting vibration model.It is also realized that the change of higher modes is bigger when long lasso damage,on the other side,the change of lower modes will be large when the lasso damaged is in short area.",2012,
The Case of Greek Ports,"The future of tourism development is largely dependent on the natural environment and its preservation (Hall and Lew in Sustainable tourism: a geographical perspective. Prentice Hall, New Jersey, 1998). Thus environment is not only an important foundation for tourism sustainable development, but it can also be the foundation for unique attractions for tourists (Zi in Tourism Management 46:11â€“19, 2015). Tourism by its very nature is a resource dependent industry and some commentators argue that sustainable tourism is unachievable given the industryâ€™s ability to pollute and consume resources (Johnson in Marine Policy 26(4):261â€“270, 2002). This view has been summarized as follows: â€œTourism contains the seed of its own destruction; tourism can kill tourism, destroying the very environmental attractions which visitors come to a location to experienceâ€ (Glasson et al. Towards visitor impact management: visitor impacts, carrying capacity and management responses in Europeâ€™s historic towns and cities (urban and regional planning and development). Avebury, Surrey, 1995). The tourism industry is of great importance for Greece and cruising is considered as a major part of it. The estimation of detailed NOx, SO2 and PM2.5 emissions to air due to cruise ships approaching Greek ports is presented in this chapter. The methodological approach is based on detailed technical data and records every cruise ship movement in the studied ports for the year 2013 in order to estimate air emissions and their anticipated social costs. The emissions were analyzed in terms of gas species, seasonality and activity.",2016,
"Safety and acceptability of vaginal disinfection with benzalkonium chloride in HIV infected pregnant women in west Africa: ANRS 049b phase II randomized, double blinded placebo controlled trial. DITRAME Study Group.","OBJECTIVES
To study the tolerance and acceptability in Africa of a perinatal intervention to prevent vertical HIV transmission using benzalkonium chloride disinfection.


DESIGN
A randomized, double blinded phase II trial.


SETTING
Prenatal care units in Abidjan (CÃ´te d'Ivoire) and Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso).


PATIENTS
Women accepting testing and counselling who were seropositive for HIV-1 and under 37 weeks of pregnancy were eligible. A total of 108 women (54 in each group) enrolled from November 1996 to April 1997, with their informed consent.


INTERVENTION
Women self administered daily a vaginal suppository of 1% benzalkonium chloride or matched placebo from 36 weeks of pregnancy, and a single intrapartum dose. The neonate was bathed with 1% benzalkonium chloride solution or placebo within 30 minutes after birth.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Adverse events were recorded weekly, with a questionnaire and speculum examination in women through delivery, and examination of the neonate through day 30. The incidence of genital signs and symptoms in the women and cutaneous or ophthalmological events in newborns were compared between groups on an intent to treat basis.


RESULTS
The median duration of prepartum treatment was 21 days (range 0-87 days). Compliance was 87% for prepartum and 69% for intrapartum treatment, and 88% for the neonatal bath, without differences between the two groups. In women, the most frequent event was leucorrhoea; the incidence of adverse events did not differ between treatment groups. In children, the incidence of dermatitis and conjunctivitis did not differ between the benzalkonium chloride and placebo groups (p = 0.16 and p = 0.29, respectively).


CONCLUSION
Vaginal disinfection with benzalkonium chloride is a feasible and well tolerated intervention in west Africa. Its efficacy in preventing vertical HIV transmission remains to be demonstrated.",1999,Sexually transmitted infections
"Osteology and Functional Morphology of the Hind Limb of the Marine Sloth Thalassocnus (Mammalia, Tardigrada)","The anatomy of the skeletal elements of the hind limb of Thalassocnus is described. This genus of â€œground slothâ€ comprises five species represented by Neogene specimens from the coast of Peru and Chile, mostly found in the Pisco Formation. The hind limb of the genus Thalassocnus as a whole is characterized by a small iliac wing, a gracile femur with well-formed femoral neck, teardrop shaped patella, long and slender tibia, triangular tuber calcis, and proximal development of the lateral process of the Mt V. The comparison of the species of Thalassocnus with each other suggests a progressive shift to a particular ecology from the earliest to the latest species of the genus, a conclusion in agreement with those of the studies of craniomandibular, dental, and forelimb gross morphology, and bone internal microstructure. The pedolateral stance, which involves the bearing of the weight on the lateral side of the foot, was practiced by the earliest species of Thalassocnus, as was the case for other Megatheria. This stance was apparently forsaken by the late species of the genus in favor of the acquisition of a secondary plantigrady. A plantigrade hind limb may have been more efficient for paddling and for bottom-walking. Additionally, the late species of Thalassocnus differ from the early ones in the morphology of the pelvis and the slight overall reduction of the hind limb. This suggests the decrease of the support function of the hind limb of these species when compared to that of the early species of Thalassocnus.",2014,Journal of Mammalian Evolution
The effect of various compounds on urea formation by rat liver slices.,"In studies on the synthesis of urea in vitro, the nitrogen is usually supplied as NH&l or as (NHJ)$SO~ (l-3). It has been suggested that the mechanism by which such nitrogen enters the cycle and forms urea is somewhat different from that utilized by nitrogen supplied in the form of glutamine or amino acids. Leuthardt and Glasson (2) believe that ammonia from inorganic salts enters the cycle directly but that ammonia from amino acids may be synthesized into glutamine, which then transfers it to ornithine. Once citrulline is formed, the second molecule of ammonia is added and the reaction is catalyzed by adenosine triphosphate and glutamic acid, as shown by Cohen and Hayano (3). The source of the carbon dioxide which, along with the nitrogen, is added to ornithine to form citrulline can be CO2 supplied by sodium bicarbonate, as recently proved by Grisolia and Cohen (4) but previously indicated by Leuthardt and Glasson (2), who showed that urea formation from ammonium salts was greatly decreased when liver slices were incubated in phosphate instead of bicarbonate medium. The latter also extended the original observations of Krebs (1) by demonstrating that the addition of pyruvate or oxalacetate increased the urea production in the absence of bicarbonate, presumably by supplying COZ. The following is a report of experiments with liver slices, comparing urea production from an ammonium salt, glutamine, and an amino acid under varying conditions.",1949,The Journal of biological chemistry

Putting Big Data analytics to work: Feature selection for forecasting electricity prices using the LASSO and random forests,"Successful companies are increasingly those companies that excel in the task of extracting knowledge from data. Tapping the source of â€˜Big Dataâ€™ requires powerful algorithms combined with a strong understanding of the data used. One of the key challenges in predictive analytics is the identification of relevant factors that may explain the variables of interest. In this paper, we present a case study in predictive analytics in which we focus on the selection of relevant exogenous variables. More specifically, we attempt to predict the German electricity spot prices with reference to historical prices and a deep set of weather variables. In order to choose the relevant weather stations, we use the least absolute shrinkage selection operation (LASSO) and random forests to implicitly execute a variable selection. Overall, in our case study of German weather data, we manage to improve forecasting accuracy by up to 16.9% in terms of mean average error.",2015,J. Decis. Syst.
Estudio prospectivo sobre el impacto en la calidad de vida y los resultados visuales obtenidos durante una campaÃ±a de cirugÃ­a ocular en Burkina Faso: eficacia y eficiencia de un proyecto de cooperaciÃ³n sanitaria,"La catarata es la primera causa de ceguera en los paises en vias de desarrollo. La accesibilidad en el diagnostico y tratamiento quirurgico de esta enfermedad ocular nos ha llevado a desarrollar proyectos de cooperacion en Burkina Faso desde hace mas de 15 anos con el objeto de intentar reducir la elevada prevalecia de la ceguera provocada por esta afeccion en ese medio. El presente estudio describe la metodologia de trabajo empleada para el desarrollo de la campana de cirugia ocular masiva que las ONG Stop Ceguera y Visio Sense Fronteres llevaron a cabo durante el mes de diciembre de 2008 en Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso), los resultados obtenidos en lo que se refiere a cambio en la funcion visual y calidad de vida de los pacientes operados y finalmente un analisis de los costes soportados durante la misma. Fueron incluidos en el estudio un total de 315 ojos operados de cataratas correspondientes a 305 pacientes que cumplieron los criterios de inclusion. Se realizaron controles evolutivos a las 24 horas asi como a los 3 y 12 meses tras las intervenciones. El 79,8% de los pacientes revisados alcanzo una agudeza visual corregida igual o mayor a 0,3 a los doce meses. Los pacientes experimentaron una mejoria en su agudeza visual corregida que llego a ser un ano tras la operaciones quince veces superior a la calculada en la visita preoperatoria. El 40,5% de los ojos operados obtuvo un equivalente esferico comprendido entre +1,00D y -1,00D a los tres meses de la cirugia. El astigmatismo corneal tras las intervenciones fue elevado a los 3 meses (astigmatismo inducido por la operacion igual a 1,95 D) pero descendio a niveles similares a los calculados en el control preoperatorio al ano de la intervencion (0,22 D). De las complicaciones intraoperatorias la mas comun fue la rotura de la capsula posterior -acontecida en el 2,85% de los ojos operados- y la mas grave un caso de hemorragia expulsiva. Doce meses despues de las operaciones la incidencia de opacificacion capsular alcanzo el 9,2% de los ojos intervenidos. El costo unitario por cada cirugia fue 59â‚¬, incluidos los gastos de alojamiento y transporte, coste muy inferior al soportado para las intervenciones en nuestro medio. Tras analizar los resultados obtenidos con un cuestionario de 16 preguntas adaptado a la poblacion burkinabe para evaluar el impacto que las intervenciones tuvieron en la calidad de vida referente a la vision de la poblacion operada, se encontro una mejora significativa en todos los items excepto en los correspondientes al deslumbramiento y el dolor. El indice global de satisfaccion estimado mantuvo una correlacion significativa con las visiones alcanzadas por los pacientes, mostrando una gran mejoria en la calidad de vida a los tres meses de las intervenciones, asi como un ligero descenso a los doce. El estudio cualitativo demostro que las intervenciones fueron valoradas por los pacientes y su entorno de forma satisfactoria. Es posible concluir de los resultados obtenidos que la presente campana masiva de cirugia ocular promovida por nuestras organizaciones no gubernamentales fue un instrumento eficiente, eficaz y seguro en la lucha contra la ceguera por cataratas en paises subdesarrollados y que mejoro de forma significativa la calidad de vida de los enfermos intervenidos.",2011,

Urate and Nonanoate Mark the Relationship between Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Intake and Blood Pressure in Adolescent Girls: A Metabolomics Analysis in the ELEMENT Cohort,"We sought to identify metabolites that mark the relationship of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake with adiposity and metabolic risk among boys (n = 114) and girls (n = 128) aged 8-14 years. We conducted the analysis in three steps: (1) linear regression to examine associations of SSB intake (quartiles) with adiposity, glycemia, lipids, and blood pressure (BP); (2) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to identify SSB-associated metabolites from an untargeted dataset of 938 metabolites; and (3) linear regression to determine whether SSB-related metabolites are also associated with adiposity and metabolic risk. In girls, SSB intake was associated with marginally higher BP (Q2 vs, Q1: 1.11 [-3.90, 6.13], Q3 vs. Q1: 1.16 [-3.81, 6.13], Q4 vs. Q1: 4.65 [-0.22, 9.53] mmHg systolic blood pressure (SBP); P-trend = 0.07). In boys, SSB intake corresponded with higher C-peptide insulin resistance (Q2 vs. Q1: 0.06 [-0.06, 0.19], Q3 vs. Q1: 0.01 [-0.12, 0.14], Q4 vs. Q1: 0.17 [0.04, 0.30] ng/mL; P-trend = 0.03) and leptin (P-trend = 0.02). LASSO identified 6 annotated metabolites in girls (5-methyl-tetrohydrofolate, phenylephrine, urate, nonanoate, deoxyuridine, sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and 3 annotated metabolites in boys (2-piperidinone, octanoylcarnitine, catechol) associated with SSB intake. Among girls, urate and nonanoate marked the relationship of SSB intake with BP. None of the SSB-associated metabolites were related to health outcomes in boys.",2019,Metabolites
Two-dimensional smoothing of mortality rates,"We propose three new practical methods of smoothing mortality rates (the procedure known in demography as graduation) over two dimensions: age and time. The first method uses bivariate thin plate splines. The second uses a similar procedure but with lasso-type regularization. The third method also uses bivariate lasso-type regularization, but allows for both period and cohort effects. Thus the mortality rates are modelled as the sum of four components: a smooth bivariate function of age and time, smooth one-dimensional cohort effects, smooth one-dimensional period effects and random errors. Cross validation is used to compare these new methods of graduation with existing approaches.",2013,
Remodeling California Prehistory: Notes on the Changing Roles of Ethnohistory in Archaeology,"An impressive stream of monographs, books and journal articles dealing with California prehistory has appeared in national and international publications during the last decade, attesting perhaps to a regional archaeological renaissance. Works that illustrate this trend admittedly a limited and unsystematic sample -include Arnold (1992, 1995), Broughton (1994a, 1994b, 1997), Bettinger (1991), Broughton and O'Connell (1999), Colten and Arnold (1998), Connolly et al.

(1999), King (1990), Lightfoot (1992), Raab et al. (1995a), and Raab and Larson (1997). While these discussions reflect diverse topics and regional settings, their common focus on explanatory models seems to be a key element in winning new audiences for California archaeology far beyond the state's boundaries. Model-building -the pursuit of theory-based explanations of culture change through empirical research designed explicitly for this purpose has always exerted some influence on California archaeology, but efforts of this kind have proliferated in recent years, stimulating a series of lively debates between opposing theoretical camps (see, e.g., Arnold et al. 1997; Arnold and Pletka 1997; Broughton and O'Connell 1999; Byrd et al. 1998; Colten and Arnold 1998; Hildebrandt and Jones 1992; Raab and Larson 1997).

50 Specific detection of RNA molecules by fluorescent in situ hybridization in living cells,"The organization of eukaryotic chromatin is not static but changes as a function of cell status during processes such as proliferation, differentiation and migration. One major task of cell biologists is to develop technology and methodology for studying the chromatin organization without perturbing its function. A living cell is a dynamic object and conventional biochemical analyses do not provide spatial and temporal information. DNA quantification has not been extensively used to investigate chromatin dynamics in combination with cellular migration. In this context, an optimized, DNA specific, non perturbant method has been deve lopped for s tudying chromat in organization, using the fluorescent vital bisbenzimidazole probe Hoechst 33342 (Ho342, Paillasson et al, 1995). Computer-assisted image analysis was used to follow migratory activity and chromatin organization on living L929 fibroblasts. This approach is of interest for investigating: i) cell-extracellular matrix interactions, by using different substrates, ii) migratory response to chemotactic factors, and iii) in vitro wound assay, based on the ability of cells to migrate into a denuded scrapped off area. This model will provide efficient tools for functional and structural analysis of cell behavior. It is also interesting in order to gain a better understanding about drag action. It allows in situ xenobiotic action monitoring under varying living conditions.

"Multi-modality neuroimaging brain-age in UK Biobank: relationship to biomedical, lifestyle and cognitive factors","The brain-age paradigm is proving increasingly useful for exploring ageing-related disease and can predict important future health outcomes. Most brain-age research utilises structural neuroimaging to index brain volume. However, ageing affects multiple aspects of brain structure and function, which can be examined using multi-modality neuroimaging. Using UK Biobank, brain-age was modelled in n=2,205 healthy people with T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, T2*, diffusion-MRI, task fMRI and resting-state fMRI. In a held-out healthy validation set (n=520), chronological age was accurately predicted (r=0.79, mean absolute error=3.52 years) using LASSO regression, higher than using any modality separately. Thirty-four neuroimaging phenotypes were deemed informative by the regression (after bootstrapping); predominantly grey-matter volume and white-matter microstructure measures. When applied to new individuals from UK Biobank (n=14,701), significant associations with multi-modality brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) were found for: stroke history, diabetes diagnosis, smoking, alcohol intake and some, but not all, cognitive measures (corrected p<0.05). Multi-modality neuroimaging can improve brain-age prediction, and derived brain-PAD values are sensitive to biomedical and lifestyle factors that negatively impact brain and cognitive health.",2019,bioRxiv

On the $\ell_1-\ell_q$ Regularized Regression,"In this paper we consider the problem of grouped variable selection in high-dimensional regression using $\ell_1-\ell_q$ regularization ($1\leq q \leq \infty$), which can be viewed as a natural generalization of the $\ell_1-\ell_2$ regularization (the group Lasso). The key condition is that the dimensionality $p_n$ can increase much faster than the sample size $n$, i.e. $p_n \gg n$ (in our case $p_n$ is the number of groups), but the number of relevant groups is small. The main conclusion is that many good properties from $\ell_1-$regularization (Lasso) naturally carry on to the $\ell_1-\ell_q$ cases ($1 \leq q \leq \infty$), even if the number of variables within each group also increases with the sample size. With fixed design, we show that the whole family of estimators are both estimation consistent and variable selection consistent under different conditions. We also show the persistency result with random design under a much weaker condition. These results provide a unified treatment for the whole family of estimators ranging from $q=1$ (Lasso) to $q=\infty$ (iCAP), with $q=2$ (group Lasso)as a special case. When there is no group structure available, all the analysis reduces to the current results of the Lasso estimator ($q=1$).",2008,arXiv: Machine Learning
An E-cient Proximal Gradient Method for General Structured Sparse Learning,"We study the problem of learning high dimensional regression models regularized by a structured-sparsity-inducing penalty that encodes prior structural information on either input or output sides. We consider two widely adopted types of such penalties as our motivating examples: 1) overlapping-group-lasso penalty, based on â€˜1=â€˜2 mixed-norm, and 2) graph-guided fusion penalty. For both types of penalties, due to their non-separability, developing an eâ€cient optimization method has remained a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a general optimization framework, called proximal gradient method, which can solve the structured sparse learning problems with a smooth convex loss and a wide spectrum of non-smooth and non-separable structured-sparsity-inducing penalties, including the overlapping-group-lasso and graph-guided fusion penalties. Our method exploits the structure of such penalties, decouples the non-separable penalty function via the dual norm, introduces its smooth approximation, and solves this approximation function. It achieves a convergence rate signiflcantly faster than the standard flrst-order method, subgradient method, and is much more scalable than the most widely used method, namely interior-point method for second-order cone programming and quadratic programming formulations. The eâ€ciency and scalability of our method are demonstrated on both simulated and real genetic datasets.",2010,
Mineralogical and physicochemical characterization of selected Portuguese Mesozoic-Cenozoic muddy/clayey raw materials to be potentially used as healing clays,"Abstract The use of pelitic geological materials for the treatment of muscle-bone-skin pathologies, by application of a cataplasm made of clay and mineral water mixture, is currently receiving attention and interest from the general public and scientific community. In Portugal there are several natural occurrences of clays/muds which are used for pelotherapy and/or geotherapy. These are carried out either indoors (thalassotherapy and thermal centres) or outdoors, in natural sites generally located near the seaside. The aim of this study is to assess the mineralogical and physicochemical properties of Portuguese raw materials for therapeutic purposes. These materials were collected from different Portuguese Mesozoic-Cenozoic geological formations located in the neighbourhood of thermal centres or at beaches known from their empirical applications. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) were used to assess the mineralogical composition of these clays. Physicochemical properties, such as specific surface area, cation exchange capacity, plasticity/abrasiveness indices and heat diffusiveness were also determined. Having distinct geological ages and genesis, the materials examined are mainly illitic. Less abundant kaolinite and smectite are also present.

Objectives: This research intended to find the relationship between the shortage of nursing workforce and hospitals performance of Tehran's Medical Sciences University. Materials and Methods: The current analysis was a cross-sectional definitive research, which was conducted in selected educational hospices associated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences during the year 2010. While using three researcher-made questionnaires, information was obtained from all clinical, paraclinical, commercial, managerial and support units of hospitals. Information was investigated according to the patterns of Iran's Healthcare Ministry and Medical Education by employing Excel software. Pabon Lasso model was used for performance measurement during the year 2010. The mixture of 3 indicators was applied to determine the period of stay, bed occupancy time and bed turnover. Results: The outcomes revealed that the personnel of nursing, in the 18 hospital wards (66.67%) were at levels below the standards, just one ward (3.7%) reached the standards requirements, and the remainder of the hospital wards (29.62%) were at greater levels than the standard requirements. Both hospitals were near the value 4 in the Pabon Lasso model. The correlation analysis among the nursing shortage and performance showed a meaningful relationship (P<0.05). Conclusion: Frequently, the examined hospices were challenged with a shortage of nursing workforce and the dissemination of workforce was not suitable. A decent supervision of workforce in conformity with the shortage of staff compensated and achieved the rules needed for the hospital's nursing workforce and this would guide to an improvement in the performance of the hospitals' actions and could present gratification for the personnel.",2015,Journal of Medicine and Life

Selje Spa Thalasso Ã¢ en helse- og velvÃ¦rekatedral?,"The use of water in healing and curing has existed from the age of antiquity. Both water from mineral springs and ocean water have been used in many cultures around the world. During the last few years, a wave of spa treatments has swept over us, also in Norway. Hotel spa is a spa located within a hotel environment that provides guests with a variety of health and healing services, and gives opportunities for health enhancement and lifeÃ‚Â­style improvement, stress reduction, well-being and relaxation. Thalassic therapy is healing by using ocean water and the beneficial qualities of a marine environment. The treatments are presented as both preventive and curing. This article examines some aspects of Selje Spa Thalasso, the only thalassic centre in Scandinavia. The centre is located by the Stadt Sea, at the edge of Selje beach in a Ã¢Â€Âœunique sacred landscapeÃ¢Â€Â.Ã‚Â  I am presenting some of the thalassic treatments offered and categories of guests who are supposed to be typical. The centre is based on a holistic view of health, characterized by Ã¢Â€ÂThe good circleÃ¢Â€Â, ideas that also exist within the alternative health movement.

Variable Selection for BART: An Application to Gene Regulation,"We consider the task of discovering gene regulatory networks, which are defined as sets of genes and the corresponding transcription factors which regulate their expression levels. This can be viewed as a variable selection problem, potentially with high dimensionality. Variable selection is especially challenging in high-dimensional settings, where it is difficult to detect subtle individual effects and interactions between predictors. Bayesian Additive Regression Trees [BART, Ann. Appl. Stat. 4 (2010) 266â€298] provides a novel nonparametric alternative to parametric regression approaches, such as the lasso or stepwise regression, especially when the number of relevant predictors is sparse relative to the total number of available predictors and the fundamental relationships are nonlinear. We develop a principled permutation-based inferential approach for determining when the effect of a selected predictor is likely to be real. Going further, we adapt the BART procedure to incorporate informed prior information about variable importance. We present simulations demonstrating that our method compares favorably to existing parametric and nonparametric procedures in a variety of data settings. To demonstrate the potential of our approach in a biological context, we apply it to the task of inferring the gene regulatory network in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We find that our BART-based procedure is best able to recover the subset of covariates with the largest signal compared to other variable selection methods. The methods developed in this work are readily available in the R package bartMachine.",2014,The Annals of Applied Statistics
ModÃ¨les graphiques pour la classification et les sÃ©ries temporelles,"Dans cette these nous nous interessons aux methodes de classifications supervisees utilisant les reseaux bayesiens.

Microbial aspects of atrazine degradation in natural environments,"The potential toxicity of thes-triazine herbicide atrazine motivates continuous bioremediation-directed research. Several indigenous soilatrazine-catabolizing microbialassociations and monocultures have been enriched/isolated from compromised sites. Of these, Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP has become a reference strain and has been used to elucidate sequences of the catabolic enzymes atzA, atzB, atzCand atzD involvedin one aerobic degradation pathway and develop probes for the genes which encode these enzymes. Despite this, hitherto unknown or novel microorganisms, with unique sequences and different enzyme-mediated operative pathways, warrant continued investigations for effective site bioremediation. Also, the sustained effectiveness of natural attenuation must be demonstrated continually so regular site evaluations and results analyses, despite the limitations of chemical extraction methodologies, are crucial practices. For both directed and intrinsic bioremediation monitoring, traditional microbial association studies must be complemented by more advanced physiological and molecular approaches. The occurrence of catabolic plasmids, in particular, should be probed with DNA hybridization techniques. Also, PCR-DGGEand subsequent new sequenceelucidation should be used prior to developing new primers for DNA sequences encoding novel catabolic enzymes, and for hybridization probe development, to establish the degradative potential of a compromised site, or adoption of FISH to, for example, monitor bioaugmented remediation.",2004,Biodegradation
The clinical consequences of variable selection in multiple regression models: a case study of the Norwegian Opioid Maintenance Treatment program.,"Background: Selecting which variables to include in multiple regression models is a pervasive problem in medical research. Objectives: Based on questionnaire data (nÂ =Â 18538, 69.9% men) from the Norwegian Opioid Maintenance Treatment Program, this study aims to compare the performance of different variable selection methods and the potential clinical consequences of choice of method. The effect of missing data is also explored. Methods: The dependent variable was engagement in criminal behavior while in treatment. Twenty-nine potential covariates on demographics, psychosocial factors and drug use were tested for inclusion in a multiple logistic regression model. Both complete case and multiply imputed data were considered. We compared the results from variable selection methods ranging from expert-based and purposeful variable selection, through stepwise methods, to more recently developed penalized regression using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Results: The various variable selection methods resulted in regression models including from 9 to 22 covariates. The stepwise selection procedures generated the models with the most covariates included. The choice of variable selection method directly affected the estimated regression coefficients, both in effect size and statistical significance. For several variables the expert-based approach disagreed with all data-driven methods. Conclusions: The choice of variable selection method may strongly affect the resulting regression model, along with accompanying effect sizes and confidence intervals. This may affectÂ clinical conclusions. The process should consequently be given sufficient consideration in model building. We recommend combining expert knowledge with a data-driven variable selection method to explore the models' robustness.",2019,The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse
Institute of Statistics Mimeo Series No . 2579 Adaptive-LASSO for Cox â€™ s Proportional Hazards Model,"We investigate the variable selection problem for Coxâ€™s proportional hazards model, and propose a unified model selection and estimation procedure with desired theoretical properties and computational convenience. The new method is based on a penalized log partial likelihood with the adaptively weighted L1 penalty on regression coefficients, providing what we call the adaptive Lasso estimator. The method incorporates different penalties for different coefficients: unimportant variables receive larger penalties than important ones, so that important variables tend to be retained in the selection process, whereas unimportant variables are more likely to be dropped. Theoretical properties, such as consistency and rate of convergence of the estimator, are studied. We also show that, with proper choice of regularization parameters, the proposed estimator has the oracle properties. The convex optimization nature of the method leads to an efficient algorithm. Both simulated and real examples show that the method performs competitively.",2006,
Patient Flow Prediction via Discriminative Learning of Mutually-Correcting Processes,"Over the past decade, the rate of care unit (CU) use in the United States has been increasing. With an aging population and ever-growing demand for medical care, effective management of patients' transitions among different care facilities will prove indispensible for shortening the length of hospital stays, improving patient outcomes, allocating critical care resources, and reducing preventable re-admissions. In this paper, we focus on an important problem of predicting the so-called â€œpatient flowâ€ from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), which has not been explored via existing machine learning techniques. By treating a sequence of transition events as a point process, we develop a novel framework for modeling patient flow through various CUs and jointly predicting patients' destination CUs and duration days. Instead of learning a generative point process model via maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a novel discriminative learning algorithm aiming at improving the prediction of transition events in the case of sparse data. By parameterizing the proposed model as a mutually-correcting process, we formulate the estimation problem via generalized linear models, which lends itself to efficient learning based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, we achieve simultaneous feature selection and learning by adding a group-lasso regularizer to the ADMM algorithm. Additionally, for suppressing the negative influence of data imbalance on the learning of model, we synthesize auxiliary training data for the classes with extremely few samples, and improve the robustness of our learning method accordingly. Testing on real-world data, we show that our method obtains superior performance in terms of accuracy of predicting the destination CU transition and duration of each CU occupancy.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering
On Lasso refitting strategies,"A well-know drawback of l1-penalized estimators is the systematic shrinkage of the large coefficients towards zero. A simple remedy is to treat Lasso as a model-selection procedure and to perform a second refitting step on the selected support. In this work we formalize the notion of refitting and provide oracle bounds for arbitrary refitting procedures of the Lasso solution. One of the most widely used refitting techniques which is based on least-squares may bring a problem of interpretability, since the signs of the refitted estimator might be flipped with respect to the original estimator. This problem arises from the fact that the least-square refitting considers only the support of the Lasso solution, avoiding any information about signs or amplitudes. To this end we define a sign-consistent refitting as an arbitrary refitting procedure, preserving the signs of the first step Lasso solution and provide Oracle inequalities for such estimators. Finally, we consider special refitting strategies: Bregman Lasso and Boosted Lasso. Bregman Lasso has a fruitful property to converge to the sign-consistent least-squares refitting (least-squares with sign constraints), which provides with greater interpretability. We additionally study the Bregman Lasso refitting in the case of orthogonal design, providing with simple intuition behind the proposed method. Boosted Lasso, in contrast, considers information about magnitudes of the first Lasso step and allows to develop better oracle rates for prediction. Finally, we conduct an extensive numerical study to show advantages of one approach over others in different synthetic and semi-real scenarios.",2017,arXiv: Statistics Theory
Alternating linearization for structured regularization problems,"We adapt the alternating linearization method for proximal decomposition to structured regularization problems, in particular, to the generalized lasso problems. The method is related to two well-known operator splitting methods, the Douglas-Rachford and the Peaceman-Rachford method, but it has descent properties with respect to the objective function. This is achieved by employing a special update test, which decides whether it is beneficial to make a Peaceman-Rachford step, any of the two possible Douglas-Rachford steps, or none. The convergence mechanism of the method is related to that of bundle methods of nonsmooth optimization. We also discuss implementation for very large problems, with the use of specialized algorithms and sparse data structures. Finally, we present numerical results for several synthetic and real-world examples, including a three-dimensional fused lasso problem, which illustrate the scalability, efficacy, and accuracy of the method.",2014,J.

Convergence analyses on sparse feedforward neural networks via group lasso regularization,"In this paper, a new variant of feedforward neural networks has been proposed for a class of nonsmooth optimization problems. The penalty term of the presented neural networks stems from the Group Lasso method which selects hidden variables in a grouped manner. To deal with the non-differentiability of the original penalty term ( l 1 - l 2 norm) and avoid oscillations, smoothing techniques have been used to approximate the objective function. It is assumed that the training samples are supplied to the networks in a specific incremental way during training, that is, in each cycle samples are supplied in a fixed order. Then, under suitable assumptions on learning rate, penalization coefficients and smoothing parameters, the weak and strong convergence of the training process for the smoothing neural networks have been proved. The convergence analysis shows that the gradient of the smoothing error function approaches zero and the weight sequence converges to a fixed point, respectively. We demonstrate how the smoothing approximation parameter can be updated in the training procedure so as to guarantee the convergence of the procedure to a Clarke stationary point of the original optimization problem. In addition, we have proved that the original nonsmoothing algorithm with l 1 - l 2 norm penalty converges consistently to the same optimum solution with the corresponding smoothed algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed training algorithm.",2017,Inf. Sci.

Network-base Regularisation for Survival Analysis,"One of the principal challenges of the 21st century is the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of oncological diseases. To study the dominant risk factors, it is common to rely on patient survival data. These data sets are often associated with the genetic expression of the individual, suffering the curse of dimensionality. Methods such as LASSO and Elastic Net have proven to be efficient in dealing with problems with the same characteristics. However, these sometimes result in relatively complex models that might not be biologically significant. As a solution, this thesis presents a methodology that best restricts the solution space, favouring the most relevant genes taking into account public datasets, from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). It is considered a network of relations between proteins to explore a new method of regularisation, based on measures of centrality, namely degree and betweenness. With the restriction presented, solutions are obtained which, in general, consider genes that are biologically more interesting, having a strong presence in several oncological investigations. The results indicate that the proposed methodology results in simpler models with better results. Besides, it allows obtaining genes that are not yet associated with the type of cancer under study but manifest themselves as potential biomarker candidates to take into account. The application of this methodology in several datasets with the same characteristics together with a greater scientific validation could lead to the determination of new significant genes in the study of the expression of several types of cancer. Furthermore, it leads to the construction of simple and more robust models.",2018,

The CWD storages were found to vary from 0 to 190 m3 ha-1. They consequently increased from 23 m3 ha-1 in young-growth of the first age class (1-20 years old) to 66 m3 ha-1 in forests of eighth age class and older (more than 141 years). Statistically sound relationships between CDW storages and taxation indicators (age, stock, mean diameter and height, sum of basal areas etc.) were found. High correlations coefficients were found for relationships with age (0.86) and stock (0.89). Linkage between CDW storage and the share of the main specie in forest composition was not found. Dynamics of the number of trees and average volume of tree as well as changes in CDW structure (dead-standing/dead-down) were found. The results could be applied in assessment of CDW storages of pine forests of middle taiga. The most accurate method would be based on the relationship with stand stock.

Il Significato del Gate nella Cina Urbana in TransizioneSfide e PotenzialitÃ  del Gate nelle CittÃ  Cinesi Contemporanee,"Oggigiorno, il fenomeno delle comunita recintate e riconosciuto a livello globale, ma nel caso della Cina, le forme urbane chiuse e recintate sono un fenomeno che ha contraddistinto la storia urbana cinese sin da tempi antichi. Difatti, tale elemento e presente nella struttura della citta feudale, nei palazzi fortificati a disposizione dei nobili e nelle case a corte per la popolazione di basso ceto. Un altro esempio sono work units o danwei, del periodo socialista, fino ad arrivare alle attuali gated communities che dominano lâ€™assetto urbano di tante citta. 
Le ultime direttive elaborate dalla Chinaâ€™s Central Urban Work Conference nel dicembre del 2015 hanno identificato nelle gated communities una delle cause del traffico, di conseguenza, hanno constatato la necessita di bandirne la costruzione, demolire i recinti di quelle esistenti e collegare le strade interne con quelle pubbliche con lâ€™obiettivo di facilitare i flussi del traffico. Tale proposta suscito un largo dibattito e opposizione da parte dei residenti e degli esperti legali, questâ€™ultimi hanno sottolineato come la nuova direttiva sia contro la Legge di Proprieta del 2007 che dichiara: â€œle strade e altre aree pubbliche e servizi allâ€™interno di unâ€™area costruita, sono proprieta comune dei detentori, ad eccezione delle strade pubbliche di proprieta della cittaâ€. 
Al fine di comprendere i significati e le forze dietro il fenomeno degli insediamenti urbani confinati, che hanno caratterizzato particolarmente la citta cinese, lâ€™autore della tesi ha deciso di analizzare un lasso di tempo che parta dalla monarchia centrale fino a toccare i giorni nostri, con lâ€™obiettivo di captare idee che possano aiutare a generare alternative alla demolizione, ripensando alla presenza del â€˜confineâ€™ nella citta contemporanea Cinese. La demolizione delle mura o dei recinti in generale e la costruzione di nuove strade allâ€™interno delle comunita chiuse, potrebbe contribuire letteralmente ad alleviare il problema del traffico per un breve periodo, ma sicuramente non e la soluzione per risolverlo. Le cause del traffico e le conseguenti problematiche di cui stanno soffrendo diverse citta cinesi, non e dato (solamente) dalla presenza del gate o del muro, ma piuttosto dal modo in cui gli organi vitali della citta siano stati organizzati e distribuiti negli ultimi decenni, il problema e la mancanza di una strategia di â€˜ordine spaziale e funzionaleâ€™. 
In Cina, sin dal periodo delle riforme economiche e di apertura, la forma urbana di molte citta ha sperimentato drammatici cambiamenti che hanno trasformato i tradizionali insediamenti urbani, caratterizzati da alta densita e bilancio funzionale, in nuovi sviluppi urbani particolarmente decentralizzati. Di conseguenza, elaborare nuovi approcci che possano promuovere un sistema urbano, in cui le diverse entita urbane siano collaborative le une con le altre piuttosto che in conflitto, potrebbe portare a dei benefici alla citta in quanto un â€˜insiemeâ€™ e non un semplice contenitore di realta separate e conflittuali. Eâ€™ previsto che lâ€™equilibrio casa-lavoro potrebbe ridurre i tempi di percorrenza e le relative conseguenze in termini di traffico e inquinamento. Gli aspetti positivi delle danweis, come modello urbano autosufficiente, integrati con le specifiche esigenze della citta cinese contemporanea e lo stile di vita dei suoi residenti, potrebbe offrire unâ€™alternativa per la Cina che sta tentando di ripensare o rimodellare le sue citta dominate dalle comunita chiuse, in molti casi â€˜citta passive allâ€™interno della cittaâ€™.

A Note on Coding and Standardization of Categorical Variables in (Sparse) Group Lasso Regression,"Categorical regressor variables are usually handled by introducing a set of indicator variables, and imposing a linear constraint to ensure identifiability in the presence of an intercept, or equivalently, using one of various coding schemes. As proposed in Yuan and Lin [J. R. Statist. Soc. B, 68 (2006), 49-67], the group lasso is a natural and computationally convenient approach to perform variable selection in settings with categorical covariates. As pointed out by Simon and Tibshirani [Stat. Sin., 22 (2011), 983-1001], ""standardization"" by means of block-wise orthonormalization of column submatrices each corresponding to one group of variables can substantially boost performance. In this note, we study the aspect of standardization for the special case of categorical predictors in detail. The main result is that orthonormalization is not required; column-wise scaling of the design matrix followed by re-scaling and centering of the coefficients is shown to have exactly the same effect. Similar reductions can be achieved in the case of interactions. The extension to the so-called sparse group lasso, which additionally promotes within-group sparsity, is considered as well. The importance of proper standardization is illustrated via extensive simulations.",2018,arXiv: Computation
Adverse drug reaction or innocent bystander? A systematic comparison of statistical discovery methods for spontaneous reporting systems.,"PURPOSE
Spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) are used to discover previously unknown relationships between drugs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A plethora of statistical methods have been proposed over the years to identify these drug-ADR pairs. The objective of this study is to compare a wide variety of methods in their ability to detect these signals, especially when their detection is complicated by the presence of innocent bystanders (drugs that are mistaken to be associated with the ADR, since they are prescribed together with the drug that is the ADR's actual cause).


METHODS
Twelve methods, 24 measures in total, ranging from simple disproportionality measures (eg, the reporting odds ratio), hypothesis tests (eg, test of the Poisson mean), Bayesian shrinkage estimates (eg, the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, BCPNN) to sparse regression (LASSO), are compared in their ability to detect drug-ADR pairs in a large number of simulated SRSs with varying numbers of innocent bystanders and effect sizes. The area under the precision-recall curve is used to assess the measures' performance.


RESULTS
Hypothesis tests (especially the test of the Poisson mean) perform best when the associations are weak and there is little to no confounding by other drugs. When the level of confounding increases and/or the effect sizes become larger, Bayesian shrinkage methods should be preferred. The LASSO proves to be the most robust against the innocent bystander effect.


CONCLUSIONS
There is no absolute ""winner"". Which method to use for a particular SRS depends on the effect sizes and the level of confounding present in the data.",2020,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety
Hyper-Sparse Optimal Aggregation,"Given a finite set F of functions and a learning sample, the aim of an aggregation procedure is to have a risk as close as possible to risk of the best function in F. Up to now, optimal aggregation procedures are convex combinations of every elements of F. In this paper, we prove that optimal aggregation procedures combining only two functions in F exist. Such algorithms are of particular interest when F contains many irrelevant functions that should not appear in the aggregation procedure. Since selectors are suboptimal aggregation procedures, this proves that two is the minimal number of elements of F required for the construction of an optimal aggregation procedure in every situations. Then, we perform a numerical study for the problem of selection of the regularization parameters of the Lasso and the Elastic-net estimators. We compare on simulated examples our aggregation algorithms to aggregation with exponential weights, to Mallow's Cp and to cross-validation selection procedures.",2011,J. Mach. Learn. Res.
Robust multi-dimensional scaling via outlier-sparsity control,"Multidimensional scaling (MDS) seeks an embedding of N objects in a p &#60; N dimensional space such that inter-vector distances approximate pair-wise object dissimilarities. Despite their popularity, MDS algorithms are sensitive to outliers, yielding grossly erroneous embeddings even if few outliers contaminate the available dissimilarities. This work introduces a robust MDS approach exploiting the degree of sparsity in the outliers present. Links with compressive sampling lead to a robust MDS solver capable of coping with outliers. The novel algorithm relies on a majorization-minimization (MM) approach to minimize a regularized stress function, whereby an iterative MDS solver involving Lasso operators is obtained. The resulting scheme identifies outliers and obtains the desired embedding at a computational cost comparable to that of non-robust MDS alternatives. Numerical tests illustrate the merits of the proposed algorithm.",2011,"2011 Conference Record of the Forty Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (ASILOMAR)"

OBJETIVOS Los objetivos de la Tesis Doctoral son: 1. Valorar el peso historico, cultural, economico y ambiental de la actividad salinera y de la explotacion pesquera tradicional de las encanizadas, en relacion con la conservacion de la biodiversidad. 2. Describir la evolucion de la flota pesquera, de la actividad acuicola y de otras actividades economicas del Puerto de San Pedro del Pinatar, asi como analizar el proceso de erosion litoral de la playa de la Llana y las actuaciones necesarias para mitigar ese proceso. 3. Describir la evolucion y zonas de la afluencia de visitantes en el Parque Regional, asi como el estudio del tipo de turismo demandado. 4. Describir las construcciones y restos arqueologicos que hay en el espacio protegido, identificar aquellos que tienen un valor historico, cultural, arquitectonico y/o paisajistico relevante. 5. Evaluar la gestion del espacio protegido el que se incluye los instrumentos de planificacion y ordenacion, el control administrativo, limpieza y mantenimiento, la conservacion del patrimonio natural y el grado de cumplimiento de los objetivos de los programas de conservacion de paisaje, habitats y especies y la gestion del uso publico. METODOLOGIA La Tesis Doctoral se ha confeccionado, por un lado, a partir de la propia experiencia laboral y el analisis de documentos recopilados por el autor sobre este espacio protegido desde julio de 1993, y por otro, a traves de diversas fuentes de informacion obtenidas mediante entrevistas y la evaluacion de una extensa bibliografia proporcionada por diferentes personas y entidades. RESULTADOS Se ha heredado un territorio multifuncional desde el punto de vista social, economico y ambiental, donde el paisaje se puede definir como ecocultural, y en el que es imposible excluir la huella de las actividades del ser humano. Las Salinas son una explotacion industrial consolidada y muy avanzada, por los procesos historicos de modernizacion y ampliacion de las mimas. Las encanizadas constituyen una de las expresiones mas armoniosas de la intervencion humana en el litoral, ejemplo de uso de los recursos pesqueros, que se basa en el conocimiento del territorio y su funcionalidad. La actividad economica del Puerto refleja un descenso de la actividad pesquera. Sin embargo la acuicultura que en jaulas flotantes frente al Puerto de San Pedro presenta un importante volumen de ingresos. Las playas de la Llana presentan un claro comportamiento regresivo a excepcion de Punta de Algas, debido a la alteracion de la dinamica litoral de transporte de sedimentos Norte-Sur con la construccion del Puerto. El Parque ha pasado de tener una afluencia de visitantes de cerca de 300.000 personas entre 1999-2003, a mas de medio millon de visitantes en 2010, sobre todo en peridodo estival (70 %) y localizados en las playas (90 %). La planificacion y gestion se debe basar en el mantenimiento de la relacion entre la naturaleza y las actividades economicas. El Plan de Ordenacion de los Recursos Naturales ha tenido un desarrollo inferior al 50 % de su articulado. Se han perdido siete hectareas incluidas en el Sitio Ramsar ""Mar Menor"" con la construccion de parte de la desalinizadora, parte de la depuradora, de la Avenida Garza Real, parte de un hotel y del Centro de Talasoterapia, un jardin municipal y varios duplex situados junto al Centro de Visitantes ""Las Salinas"". La Junta Rectora se ha reunido 4 veces, la ultima en 2001. El Servicio de Informacion se ha convertido en un referente y uno de los ejes principales de la gestion del Parque, fundamental en la presencia de la Administracion y de cercania a la poblacion local y a los visitantes del Parque y tambien esta dando buen resultado el Programa de mantenimiento y limpieza. ECONOMICAL, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS RELATED TO THE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF THE SALINAS Y ARENALES DE SAN PEDRO DEL PINATAR REGIONAL PARK AIMS The objectives of this Doctoral Thesis are to: 1. Assess the historic, cultural, economic and environmental role of salt exploitation and the encanizadas traditional fishing method on biodiversity conservation. 2. Describe the evolution of the fishing fleet, fish farming and other economic activities at San Pedro del Pinatar Port. As well as to analyze the coast erosive process at Llana Beach and the necessary actions to mitigate it. 3. Describe the trend in numbers and visited areas by tourists in the Regional Park, as well as to analyze their demand. 4. Describe the archaeological constructions and remains present at the site and identify those with an historic, cultural, architectural and environmental relevancy. 5. Evaluate the management of the Park by analyzing the used management and planning tools, administration control, maintenance and cleaning and heritage conservation. Also to examine in which degree the aims of the Conservation Programs (applying landscape, habitats, species and public use) have been achieved. METHODS This Doctoral Thesis has been developed on the one hand with the own working experience and the document analysis compiled since July 1993 by the author and on the other hand, through diverse sources of information obtained by means of interviews and the evaluation of an extensive bibliography provided by different people and organizations. RESULTS A multifunctional territory has been inherited from the social, economic and environmental point of view, where the landscape can be defined as ""ecocultural"", and in which it is impossible to exclude the traces left by human activities. Salt exploitation at this Park is a consolidated advanced industry by the historical processes of modernization and their further development. The encanizadas traditional fishing method is one of the most harmonious expressions of human intervention in the coast, example of a use of fishing resources based on the knowledge of the territory and its functionality. The economic activity of the port reflects a reduction of fishing. Nevertheless fish farming presents an important volume of income. The beaches of La llana present a clear regressive trend with the exception of Punta de Algas, due to the alteration of the North-South coastal dynamics of sediment transport caused by the construction of the Port. The Park has shifted from near 300,000 visitors between 1999-2003, to more than one million visitors in 2010, concentrated mainly in summer (70%) and located at the beaches (90%). The Parks's planning and management should be based on the maintenance of the relation between nature and economic activities. The Natural Resources Management Plan has been partially achieved (50%). Seven hectares included in the Mar Menor Ramsar Site have been lost with the construction of a desalination plant, part of a sewage plant, an Avenue, part of a hotel and a thalassotherapy center, a municipal garden and several duplex located next to the Salt lake Visitor Center . The Park management Board has met 4 times, the last one in 2001. The Information Service has become crucial and one of the main axes of the management of the Park, essential within the presence of the Public Administration and the proximity to the local population and visitors. The Maintenance and Cleaning programe has given good results.",2013,
DuttilitÃ  e resistenza di strutture in c.a.: influenza della localizzazione delle deformazioni nell'acciaio,"L'analisi della resistenza limite delle strutture in calcestruzzo armato sotto assegnati processi di carico costituisce uno dei temi di ricerca di base e di grande attualita dell'ingegneria strutturale. In tale contesto un ruolo determinante e giocato dalla duttilita delle sezioni in c.a. che, sottoposte a stati di sollecitazione generalmente complessi, possono con-sentire o meno il raggiungimento dello stato di meccanismo di collasso, auspicabile per la struttura che riesce, in tal modo, ad esplicare la sua resistenza limite senza il verificarsi di condizioni di rottura anticipata per fragilita locale.
Del resto e ben noto che il comportamento delle membrature in c.a., costituite dalla compartecipazione di materiali a caratteristiche estremamente differenziate, quali il calcestruzzo e l'acciaio, possa risultare fortemente variabile, e quindi propendere verso un comportamento fragile o duttile, a seconda dell'entita di diversi parametri caratteristici quali la resistenza dell'acciaio e del calcestruzzo, le percentuali di acciaio presenti nella sezione, l'entita dello sforzo normale.
I nuovi acciai, ormai diffusi in tutta Europa, che hanno praticamente sostituito il tipo Feb44 tradizionale, realizzati con procedimento Tempeore, di cui si parlera diffusamente nel Cap. 2, possiedono, rispetto agli acciai di precedente impiego, caratteristiche meccaniche che possono risultare sensibilmente diverse. Questi sono, infatti, caratterizzati da un ridotto rapporto tra tensione di rottura e di snervamento, un minore allungamento a rottura, e tensioni di snervamento superiori rispetto a quelle nominali. L'introduzione di tali acciai puo, quindi, migliorare le caratteristiche locali di resistenza ma, al contrario, ridurre la duttilita degli elementi strutturali e le capacita ultime dell'intera struttura.
Una volta raggiunta la condizione di fessurazione della sezione e di snervamento dell'acciaio, si verifica che ulteriori incrementi di carico comportano aumenti di deformazione nell'acciaio snervato tanto piu elevati quanto minore e il rapporto di incrudimento dell'acciaio, e cioe il rapporto tra la tensione di rottura e la tensione di snervamento. In prossimita delle sezioni fessurate si generano, pertanto, delle concentrazioni o localizzazioni di deformazioni nell'acciaio, e quindi viene rapidamente raggiunta la condizione di massimo allungamento e rottura della barra. La mancata diffusione delle deformazioni plastiche nell'armatura comporta una ridotta duttilita dell'intero elemento e la tendenza ad un comportamento fragile globale della struttura.
Il fenomeno risulta piu evidente e complesso in presenza di carichi ciclici in quanto l'alternanza di sollecitazioni di trazione e compressione nell'acciaio, in corrispondenza delle sezioni fessurate, produce effetti di instabilita delle barre, e degrado dell'aderenza tra calcestruzzo ed acciaio per espulsione del copriferro. Le caratteristiche meccaniche dell'acciaio possono, pertanto, influenzare in modo rilevante la capacita di duttilita e di resistenza di una struttura. in particolare soggetta ad azioni sismiche.
L'interesse rivolto alla problematica illustrata, da parte di vari autori, e testimoniato dalla recente bibliografia disponibile sull'argomento e dalle indagini sperimentali tuttora in fase di sviluppo, miranti a definire i requisiti di duttilita minima da richiedere alle barre di armatura.
In tale contesto si inserisce questo lavoro che partendo da una semplice modellazione di elementi soggetti a sollecitazioni monotone di trazione, flessione e pressoflessione, si pone l'obiettivo di chiarire l'influenza delle caratteristiche degli acciai sul comportamento post-elastico di semplici strutture.",2007,
A Systematic Approach to De fi ning themicroRNA Landscape in Metastasis,"The microRNA (miRNA) landscape changes during the progression of cancer. We defined a metastasis-associated miRNA landscape using a systematic approach.We profiled and validated miRNA and mRNA expression in a unique series of human colorectal metastasis tissues together with their matched primary tumors and corresponding normal tissues. We identified an exclusive miRNA signature that is differentially expressed in metastases. Three of these miRNAs were identified as key drivers of an EMT-regulating network acting though a number of novel targets. These targets include SIAH1, SETD2, ZEB2, and especially FOXN3, which we demonstrated for the first time as a direct transcriptional suppressor of N-cadherin. The modulation of Ncadherin expression had significant impact on migration, invasion, andmetastasis in twodifferent in vivomodels. The significant deregulation of the miRNAs defining the network was confirmed in an independent patient set as well as in a database of diverse malignancies derived from more than 6,000 patients. Our data define a novel metastasis-orchestrating network based on systematic hypothesis generation frommetastasis tissues. Cancer Res; 75(15); 3010â€“9. 2015 AACR. Introduction An estimated 90% of cancer-related deaths are caused by the direct or indirect effects of metastatic dissemination (1). A key question has been to define molecularly the regulatory networks that endow tumor cells with metastatic properties. Several in vivo models have attempted to address this issue (2, 3), but have been limited in their capacity to reflect faithfully human cancer metastasis. Although the direct analysis of human samples would be advantageous for hypothesis generation, few studies have systematically analyzed resected human metastasis tissue in comparison with the corresponding primary tumors and associated normal tissues, largely because such matched tissue sample series are rare. microRNAs (miRNA)have emergedas an increasingly important classofmolecules that can regulate themetastatic process (4) and to prime the metastatic niche (5). To date, however, a systematic analysis ofmiRNAswhose expression is associatedwithmetastasis, or that act to regulate metastasis, has not been carried out. To address this issue, we analyzed global miRNA and mRNA expression in a unique series of primary tumors, their matched metastases, and the corresponding normal tissue from the primary and metastatic sites taken from patients with colorectal cancer. To define a metastasis-associated miRNA signature, we identified miRNAs that were differentially expressed in metastases compared with primary tumor tissues and normal tissues, then validated differential expression using qRT-PCR. Putative mRNA targets for these metastasis-associated miRNAs were then identified in silico, and compared with the mRNA transcription profiles obtained from the same original patient samples. This analysis suggested that gene-expression patterns associated with EMT correlate with the metastasis-associated miRNA signature. Using these findings to guide functional studies in vitro and in vivo, we focused on miRNAs that were predicted to regulate the cadherin switch during EMT, and thereby identified a novel miRNA-driven regulatory network that fosters invasion and metastasis. These data functionally validate the metastasis-associated miRNA signature we identified, and suggest that further analysis of the datasets we have generated will generate additional insights into critical molecular regulatory networks that control metastasis.

Grouped penalization estimation of the osteoporosis data in the traditional Chinese medicine,"Both continuous and categorical covariates are common in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) research, especially in the clinical syndrome identification and in the risk prediction research. For groups of dummy variables which are generated by the same categorical covariate, it is important to penalize them group-wise rather than individually. In this paper, we discuss the group lasso method for a risk prediction analysis in TCM osteoporosis research. It is the first time to apply such a group-wise variable selection method in this field. It may lead to new insights of using the grouped penalization method to select appropriate covariates in the TCM research. The introduced methodology can select categorical and continuous variables, and estimate their parameters simultaneously. In our application of the osteoporosis data, four covariates (including both categorical and continuous covariates) are selected out of 52 covariates. The accuracy of the prediction model is excellent. Compared with the prediction model with different covariates, the group lasso risk prediction model can significantly decrease the error rate and help TCM doctors to identify patients with a high risk of osteoporosis in clinical practice. Simulation results show that the application of the group lasso method is reasonable for the categorical covariates selection model in this TCM osteoporosis research.",2013,Journal of Applied Statistics
Stochastic model search with binary outcomes for genome-wide association studies,"OBJECTIVE
The spread of case-control genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has stimulated the development of new variable selection methods and predictive models. We introduce a novel Bayesian model search algorithm, Binary Outcome Stochastic Search (BOSS), which addresses the model selection problem when the number of predictors far exceeds the number of binary responses.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our method is based on a latent variable model that links the observed outcomes to the underlying genetic variables. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach is used for model search and to evaluate the posterior probability of each predictor.


RESULTS
BOSS is compared with three established methods (stepwise regression, logistic lasso, and elastic net) in a simulated benchmark. Two real case studies are also investigated: a GWAS on the genetic bases of longevity, and the type 2 diabetes study from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Simulations show that BOSS achieves higher precisions than the reference methods while preserving good recall rates. In both experimental studies, BOSS successfully detects genetic polymorphisms previously reported to be associated with the analyzed phenotypes.


DISCUSSION
BOSS outperforms the other methods in terms of F-measure on simulated data. In the two real studies, BOSS successfully detects biologically relevant features, some of which are missed by univariate analysis and the three reference techniques.


CONCLUSION
The proposed algorithm is an advance in the methodology for model selection with a large number of features. Our simulated and experimental results showed that BOSS proves effective in detecting relevant markers while providing a parsimonious model.",2012,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA

Spatiotemporal modeling of internal states distribution for lithium-ion battery,"Abstract Electrochemical properties of the battery are described in partial differential equations that are impossible to compute online. These internal states are spatially distributed and thus difficult to measure in the battery operation. A space-time separation method is applied to model the electrochemical properties of the battery with the help of the extended Kalman filter. The model is efficiently optimized by using LASSO adaptation method and can be updated through data-based learning. The analytical model derived is able to offer a fast estimation of internal states of the battery, and thus has potential to become a prediction model for battery management system.",2016,Journal of Power Sources
Literature-based genetic risk scores for coronary heart disease: the Cardiovascular Registry Maastricht (CAREMA) prospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk factors (RF). Using a case-cohort study within the prospective Cardiovascular Registry Maastricht (CAREMA) cohort, we tested if genetic risk scores (GRS) based on GWAS-identified SNPs are associated with and predictive for future CHD.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Incident cases (n=742), that is, participants who developed CHD during a median follow-up of 12.1 years (range, 0.0-16.9 years), were compared with a randomly selected subcohort of 2221 participants selected from the total cohort (n=21 148). We genotyped 179 SNPs previously associated with CHD or CHD RF in GWAS as published up to May 2, 2011. The allele-count GRS, composed of all SNPs, the 153 RF SNPs, or the 29 CHD SNPs were not associated with CHD independent of CHD RF. The weighted 29 CHD SNP GRS, with weights obtained from GWAS for every SNP, were associated with CHD independent of CHD RF (hazard ratio, 1.12 per weighted risk allele; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.21) and improved risk reclassification with 2.8% (P=0.031). As an exploratory approach to achieve weighting, we performed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis on all SNPs and the CHD SNPs. The CHD LASSO GRS performed equal to the weighted CHD GRS, whereas the Overall LASSO GRS performed slightly better than the weighted CHD GRS.


CONCLUSIONS
A GRS composed of CHD SNPs improves risk prediction when adjusted for the effect sizes of the SNPs. Alternatively LASSO regression analysis may be used to achieve weighting; however, validation in independent populations is required.",2012,Circulation. Cardiovascular genetics
Using LASSO in gene co-expression network for genome-wide identification of gene interactions responding to salt stress in rice,"In many applications, such as gene co-expression network analyses, data arises with a huge number of covariates while the size of sample is comparatively small. To improve the accuracy of prediction, variable selection is often used to get a sparse solution by forcing coefficients of variables contributing less to the observed response variable to zero. Various algorithms were developed for variable selection, but LASSO is well known for its statistical accuracy, computational feasibility and broad applicability to adaptation. In this project, we applied LASSO to the gene co-expression network of rice with salt stress to discover key gene interactions for salt-tolerance related phenotypes. The dataset we have is a high-dimensional one, having 50K genes from 100 samples, with the issue of multicollinearity for fitting linear regression - the expression level of genes in the same pathway tends to be highly correlated. The property of LASSO with sparse parameters is naturally suitable to identify gene interactions of interest in this dataset. After biologically functional modules in the co-expression network was identified, the major changed expression patterns were further selected by LASSO regression to establish a linear relationship between gene expression profiles and physiological responses, such as sodium/potassium condenses, with salt stress. Five modules of intensively co-expressed genes, from 45 to 291 genes, were identified by our method with significant P-values, which indicate these modules are significantly associated with physiological responses to stress. Genes in these modules have functions related to ion transport, osmotic adjustment, and oxidative tolerance. For example, LOC_Os7g47350 and LOC_Os07g37320 are co-expressed gene in the same module 15. Both are ion transporter genes and have higher gene expression levels for rice with low sodium levels with salt stress.",2018,bioRxiv
Split Regularized Regression,"We propose an approach for fitting linear regression models that splits the set of covariates into groups. The optimal split of the variables into groups and the regularized estimation of the regression coefficients are performed by minimizing an objective function that encourages sparsity within each group and diversity among them. The estimated coefficients are then pooled together to form the final fit. Our procedure works on top of a given penalized linear regression estimator (e.g., Lasso, elastic net) by fitting it to possibly overlapping groups of features, encouraging diversity among these groups to reduce the correlation of the corresponding predictions. For the case of two groups, elastic net penalty and orthogonal predictors, we give a closed form solution for the regression coefficients in each group. We establish the consistency of our method with the number of predictors possibly increasing with the sample size. An extensive simulation study and real-data applications show that in general the proposed method improves the prediction accuracy of the base estimator used in the procedure. Possible extensions to GLMs and other models are discussed. The supplemental material for this article, available online, contains the proofs of our theoretical results and the full results of our simulation study.",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Gene-gene concordance and the phylogenetic relationships among rare and widespread pygmy sunfishes (genus Elassoma).,"Pygmy sunfishes (Elassoma) are primarily lowland species with an interesting biogeographic dichotomy: three species have broad geographic distributions, and three are narrowly distributed (and have been recommended for threatened or endangered status). To test phylogenetic predictions derived from the geographic distributions of pygmy sunfishes and possible historical factors contributing to the threatened/endangered status of the rare species, we reconstructed trees for two mitochondrial genes and introns of three nuclear genes. The pattern and rate of nuclear and mitochondrial sequence evolution were heterogeneous within Elassoma, but relationships were generally concordant across gene trees. Elassoma is monophyletic and, as predicted by geographic distributions, E. evergladei, E. okefenokee, and E. zonatum consistently branch from deeper nodes. Phylogeographic structure in mitochondrial and nuclear genes also supports an early origin of E. zonatum. Phylogenetic analyses of the five loci support widely divergent positions for the rare species E. alabamae. Two rare species, E. boehlkei and E. okatie, are sister taxa and are related to a widespread species, E. evergladei.",2001,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution
Statistical methods for predicting mortality in patients diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism.,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES
Risk stratification in pulmonary embolism (PE) guides patient management. The purpose of this study was to develop and test novel mortality risk prediction models for subjects with acute PE diagnosed using computed tomographic pulmonary angiography in a large cohort with comprehensive clinical data.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Retrospective analyses of 1596 consecutive subjects diagnosed with acute PE from a single, large, urban teaching hospital included two modern statistical methods to predict survival in patients with acute PE. Landmark analysis was used for 90-day mortality. Adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (aLASSO), a penalization method, was used to select variables important for prediction and to estimate model coefficients. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the resulting prediction rules.


RESULTS
Using 30-day all-cause mortality outcome, three of the 16 clinical risk factors (the presence of a known malignancy, coronary artery disease, and increased age) were associated with high risk, while subjects treated with anticoagulation had lower risk. For 90-day landmark mortality, subjects with recent operations had a lower risk for death. Both prediction rules developed using aLASSO performed well compared to standard logistic regression.


CONCLUSIONS
The aLASSO regression approach combined with landmark analysis provides a novel tool for large patient populations and can be applied for clinical risk stratification among subjects diagnosed with acute PE. After positive results on computed tomographic pulmonary angiography, the presence of a known malignancy, coronary artery disease, and advanced age increase 30-day mortality. Additional risk stratification can be simplified with these methods, and future work will place imaging-based prediction of mortality in perspective with other clinical data.",2012,Academic radiology

Robust Sparse Analysis Regularization,"This paper investigates the theoretical guarantees of l1-analysis regularization when solving linear inverse problems. Most of previous works in the literature have mainly focused on the sparse synthesis prior where the sparsity is measured as the l1 norm of the coefficients that synthesize the signal from a given dictionary. In contrast, the more general analysis regularization minimizes the l1 norm of the correlations between the signal and the atoms in the dictionary, where these correlations define the analysis support. The corresponding variational problem encompasses several well-known regularizations such as the discrete total variation and the fused Lasso. Our main contributions consist in deriving sufficient conditions that guarantee exact or partial analysis support recovery of the true signal in presence of noise. More precisely, we give a sufficient condition to ensure that a signal is the unique solution of the l1 -analysis regularization in the noiseless case. The same condition also guarantees exact analysis support recovery and l2-robustness of the l1-analysis minimizer vis-aÌ€-vis an enough small noise in the measurements. This condition turns to be sharp for the robustness of the sign pattern. To show partial support recovery and l2 -robustness to an arbitrary bounded noise, we introduce a stronger sufficient condition. When specialized to the l1-synthesis regularization, our results recover some corresponding recovery and robustness guarantees previously known in the literature. From this perspective, our work is a generalization of these results.

Sparse regression techniques in low-dimensional survival data settings,"In high-dimensional data settings, sparse model fits are desired, which can be obtained through shrinkage or boosting techniques. We investigate classical shrinkage techniques such as the lasso, which is theoretically known to be biased, new techniques that address this problem, such as elastic net and SCAD, and boosting technique CoxBoost and extensions of it, which allow to incorporate additional structure. To examine, whether these methods, that are designed for or frequently used in high-dimensional survival data analysis, provide sensible results in low-dimensional data settings as well, we consider the well known GBSG breast cancer data. In detail, we study the bias, stability and sparseness of these model fitting techniques via comparison to the maximum likelihood estimate and resampling, and their prediction performance via prediction error curve estimates.",2010,Statistics and Computing

Penalized hâ€likelihood approach for variable selection in AFT randomâ€effect models,"Survival models allowing for random effects (e.g., frailty models) have been widely used for analyzing clustered timeâ€toâ€event data. Accelerated failure time (AFT) models with random effects are useful alternatives to frailty models. Because survival times are directly modeled, interpretation of the fixed and random effects is straightforward. Moreover, the fixed effect estimates are robust against various violations of the assumed model. In this paper, we propose a penalized hâ€likelihood (HL) procedure for variable selection of fixed effects in the AFT randomâ€effect models. For the purpose of variable selection, we consider three penalty functions, namely, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), and HL. We demonstrate via simulation studies that the proposed variable selection procedure is robust against the misspecification of the assumed model. The proposed method is illustrated using data from a bladder cancer clinical trial.",2019,Statistica Neerlandica
Multivariate semiparametric regression models for longitudinal data,"Multiple-outcome longitudinal data are abundant in clinical investigations. For example, infections with different pathogenic organisms are often tested concurrently, and assessments are usually taken repeatedly over time. It is therefore natural to consider a multivariate modeling approach to accommodate the underlying interrelationship among the multiple longitudinally measured outcomes. This dissertation proposes a multivariate semiparametric modeling framework for such data. Relevant estimation and inference procedures as well as model selection tools are discussed within this modeling framework. The first part of this research focuses on the analytical issues concerning binary data. The second part extends the binary model to a more general situation for data from the exponential family of distributions. The proposed model accounts for the correlations across the outcomes as well as the temporal dependency among the repeated measures of each outcome within an individual. An important feature of the proposed model is the addition of a bivariate smooth function for the depiction of concurrent nonlinear and possibly interacting influences of two independent variables on each outcome. For model implementation, a general approach for parameter estimation is developed by using the maximum penalized likelihood method. For statistical inference, a likelihood-based resampling procedure is proposed to compare the bivariate nonlinear effect surfaces across the outcomes. The final part of the dissertation presents a variable selection tool to facilitate model development in practical data analysis. Using the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty, the variable selection tool simultaneously identifies important fixed effects and random effects, determines the correlation structure of the outcomes, and selects the interaction effects in the bivariate smooth functions. Model selection and estimation are performed through a two-stage procedure based on an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. The utility of the methods is demonstrated through several clinical applications.",2014,
Against Kant,"Abstract F.W.J. Schellingâ€™s late distinction between negative and positive philosophy correlates negative philosophy with critical philosophy, which delimits what could be said of things without yet actually being able to do so. Positive philosophy, however, is able to make assertions about the actual existence of such objects without transgressing Kantâ€™s prison of finitude, i.e., without moving from an immanent, subjective and transcendental position to a transcendent (read: noumenal) object. Schellingâ€™s later positive philosophy rather asserts that one begins outside Kantâ€™s prison. This is not a dogmatism or, more properly, a dogmatizing philosophy, that attempts to reach the transcendent from an immanent locus, transcendental subjectivity, but it is a â€œdoctrinal philosophyâ€ that begins in transcendence and then has as its task the consequent construction of the domain of transcendental subjectivity. By this means, Schellingâ€™s positive philosophy, which he also deems a â€œhistoricalâ€ and â€œprogressiveâ€ philosophy, exposes what Quentin Meillassoux has termed â€œthe great outdoors.â€ Schelling, however, does not show how one might acquire access to this absolute outside, but he argues that one should depart from it. Transcendence is not the aim of knowledge but the absolute prius from which positive, i.e., progressive, philosophy begins.",2016,Angelaki
Model selection on tourism forecasting: A comparison between Bayesian model averaging and Lasso,"This study tries to tackle the tourism forecasting problem using online search queries. This recent-developed methodology is subject to several criticisms, one of which is how to choose satisfying search queries to be built in the forecasting model. This study compares two popular candidates, which are the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operator (Lasso) approach. Evidence shows that the two approaches produce similar forecasting performance but different query selection results.

Mirror Prox algorithm for multi-term composite minimization and semi-separable problems,"In the paper, we develop a composite version of Mirror Prox algorithm for solving convexâ€“concave saddle point problems and monotone variational inequalities of special structure, allowing to cover saddle point/variational analogies of what is usually called â€œcomposite minimizationâ€ (minimizing a sum of an easy-to-handle nonsmooth and a general-type smooth convex functions â€œas ifâ€ there were no nonsmooth component at all). We demonstrate that the composite Mirror Prox inherits the favourable (and unimprovable already in the large-scale bilinear saddle point case) efficiency estimate of its prototype. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can be successfully applied to Lasso-type problems with several penalizing terms (e.g. acting together $$\ell _1$$â„“1 and nuclear norm regularization) and to problems of semi-separable structures considered in the alternating directions methods, implying in both cases methods with the complexity bounds.",2015,Computational Optimization and Applications
Transfer learning with deep convolutional neural network for liver steatosis assessment in ultrasound images,"PurposeThe nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common liver abnormality. Up to date, liver biopsy is the reference standard for direct liver steatosis quantification in hepatic tissue samples. In this paper we propose a neural network-based approach for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease assessment in ultrasound.MethodsWe used the Inception-ResNet-v2 deep convolutional neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to extract high-level features in liver B-mode ultrasound image sequences. The steatosis level of each liver was graded by wedge biopsy. The proposed approach was compared with the hepatorenal index technique and the gray-level co-occurrence matrix algorithm. After the feature extraction, we applied the support vector machine algorithm to classify images containing fatty liver. Based on liver biopsy, the fatty liver was defined to have more than 5% of hepatocytes with steatosis. Next, we used the features and the Lasso regression method to assess the steatosis level.ResultsThe area under the receiver operating characteristics curve obtained using the proposed approach was equal to 0.977, being higher than the one obtained with the hepatorenal index method, 0.959, and much higher than in the case of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix algorithm, 0.893. For regression the Spearman correlation coefficients between the steatosis level and the proposed approach, the hepatorenal index and the gray-level co-occurrence matrix algorithm were equal to 0.78, 0.80 and 0.39, respectively.ConclusionsThe proposed approach may help the sonographers automatically diagnose the amount of fat in the liver. The presented approach is efficient and in comparison with other methods does not require the sonographers to select the region of interest.",2018,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery

Whole brain apparent diffusion coefficient measurements correlate with survival in glioblastoma patients,"IntroductionGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, and methods to improve the early detection of disease progression and evaluate treatment response are highly desirable. We therefore explored changes in whole-brain apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values with respect to survival (progression-free [PFS], overall [OS]) in a cohort of GBM patients followed at regular intervals until disease progression.MethodsA total of 43 subjects met inclusion criteria and were analyzed retrospectively. Histogram data were extracted from standardized whole-brain ADC maps including skewness, kurtosis, entropy, median, mode, 15th percentile (p15) and 85th percentile (p85) values, and linear regression slopes (metrics versus time) were fitted. Regression slope directionality (positive/negative) was subjected to univariate Cox regression. The final model was determined by aLASSO on metrics above threshold.ResultsSkewness, kurtosis, median, p15 and p85 were all below threshold for both PFS and OS and were analyzed further. Median regression slope directionality best modeled PFS (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001; HR 3.3; 95% CI 1.6â€“6.7), while p85 was selected for OS (pâ€‰=â€‰0.002; HR 0.29; 95% CI 0.13â€“0.64).ConclusionsOur data show tantalizing potential in the use of whole-brain ADC measurements in the follow up of GBM patients, specifically serial median ADC values which correlated with PFS, and serial p85 values which correlated with OS. Whole-brain ADC measurements are fast and easy to perform, and free of ROI-placement bias.",2019,Journal of Neuro-Oncology

On the Closed-form Proximal Mapping and Efficient Algorithms for Exclusive Lasso Models,"The exclusive lasso regularization based on the $\ell_{1,2}$ norm has become popular recently due to its superior performance over the group lasso regularization. Comparing to the group lasso regularization which enforces the competition on variables among different groups and results in inter-group sparsity, the exclusive lasso regularization also enforces the competition within each group and results in intra-group sparsity. However, to the best of our knowledge, a correct closed-form solution to the proximal mapping of the $\ell_{1,2}$ norm has still been elusive. In this paper, we fill the gap by deriving a closed-form solution for $\rm{Prox}_{\rho\|\cdot\|_1^2}(\cdot)$ and its generalized Jacobian. Based on the obtained analytical results, we are able to design efficient first and second order algorithms for machine learning models involving the exclusive lasso regularization. Our analytical solution of the proximal mapping for the exclusive lasso regularization can be used to improve the efficiency of existing algorithms relying on the efficient computation of the proximal mapping.",2019,ArXiv
Development and validation of lncRNAs-based nomogram for prediction of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer by bioinformatics analysis,"Background: Early biochemical recurrence (BCR) was considered as a sign for clinical recurrence and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa). The purpose of the present study was to identify a lncRNA-based nomogram that can predict BCR of PCa accurately. Materials and methods: Bioinformatics analysis, such as propensity score matching (PSM) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analyses were used to identify candidate lncRNAs for further bioinformatics analysis. LASSO Cox regression model was used to select the most significant prognostic lncRNAs and construct the lncRNAs signature for predicting BCR in discovery set. Additionally, a nomogram based on our lncRNAs signature was also formulated. Both lncRNAs signature and nomogram were validated in test set. GSEA was carried out to identify various gene sets which share a common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. Results: A total of 457 patients with sufficient BCR information were included in our analysis. Finally, a five lncRNAs signature significantly associated with BCR was identified in discovery set (HR=0.44, 95%CI: 0.27-0.72, C-index = 0.63) and validated in test set (HR=0.22, 95%CI: 0.09-0.56, C-index = 0.65). Additionally, the lncRNAs-based nomogram showed significant performance for predicting BCR in both discovery set (C-index = 0.74) and test set (C-index = 0.78). Conclusion: In conclusion, our lncRNAs-based nomogram is a reliable prognostic tool for BCR in PCa patients. In addition, the present study put forward the direction for the further investigation on the mechanism of PCa progression.",2019,Journal of Cancer
Diagnostic monitoring of high-dimensional networked systems via a LASSO-BN formulation,"ABSTRACT Quality control of multivariate processes has been extensively studied in the past decades; however, fundamental challenges still remain due to the complexity and the decision-making challenges that require not only sensitive fault detection but also identification of the truly out-of-control variables. In existing approaches, fault detection and diagnosis are considered as two separate tasks. Recent developments have revealed that selective monitoring of the potentially out-of-control variables, identified by a variable selection procedure combined with the process monitoring method, could lead to promising performances. Following this line, we propose the diagnostic monitoring that takes an additional step on from the selective monitoring idea and directs the monitoring effort on the potentially out-of-control variables. The identification of the truly out-of-control variables can be achieved by integrating the process monitoring formulation with process cascade knowledge represented by a Bayesian Network. Computationally efficient algorithms are developed for solving the optimization formulation with connection to the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) problem being identified. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on a simulated data set and real-world applications are conducted that show the superior performance.",2017,IISE Transactions

"In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Knappe et al. report the generation of a series of mutants of the bacterial peptide capistruin to help unravel key aspects of the biosynthesis of its unusual lasso structure.","Lasso peptides are a structurally uniquefamily of ribosomally synthesized naturalproducts produced by certain bacteriato defend against competing strains(Rebuffat et al., 2004; Severinov et al.,2007). They are characterized by an 8- or9-residue macrolactam ring formedthrough the crosslinking of their N-ter-minal amino group with the side-chaincarboxyl of a glutamic- or aspartic-acidresidue.Remarkably,theremainingC-ter-minaltailsegmentisthreadedthroughthisring, resulting in the lasso-like arrange-ment that has given the family its name.Unfoldingofthisthreadedstructureispre-ventedbybulkyaminoacidsonbothsidesof the ring, making the fold exceptionallystable. So far, six peptides have beenfound to adopt such a structure and theyhave been divided into class I and class IIlasso peptides based on the presence orabsence of two disulï¬de bonds, respec-tively, in addition to the threaded noose.Capistruin is a 19-residue class II lassopeptide encoded by the capABCD genecluster in the pathogenic bacterium Bur-kholderia thailandensis (Knappe et al.,2008). It was discovered through genomemining studies that identiï¬ed homologybetween each of the four genes in thecapABCD cluster and the correspondingfour plasmid encoded genes mcjABCD,which are responsible for producing therelated microcin J25 in Escherichia coli.The cluster encodes the 47 residueprecursor protein CapA, two processingenzymes, CapB and CapC, which areresponsible for the maturation of theCapA precursor, and CapD, which ishomologous to ABC transporters andrequired for export and self-immunity.CapB and CapC are weakly homologoustobacterialtransglutaminaseandaspara-gine synthetase B, respectively. It isproposed that during capistruin matura-tion, CapB cleaves the CapA precursorto free the Gly1 N terminus, and CapCactivates the side-chain carboxyl groupof Asp9 to promote the condensationreaction. The tight threading of theC-terminal tail through the macrolactamring in mature capistruin means theCapAprecursorhastobefoldedcorrectlybeforehand, so that the ring is enclosedaround the C-terminal tail. Maturecapistruin has potent antimicrobialactivity on Burkholderia and Pseudo-monas strains that are closely related toB. thailandensis.In the featured article, the authors sys-tematically modiï¬ed the CapA precursorto decipher the requirements for it tointeract with, and be folded and secretedby the CapB, CapC, and CapD system.Using an elegantly designed expressionsystem in E. coli, they made 48 mutatedvariants of the precursor protein andinvestigated their ability to be processedinto mature capistruin (Knappe et al.,2009). The mutations included an Ala-scan of all residues in the mature domainandtheproximalresiduesupstreamintheprosequence, as well as variants probingtheimplicationsofextendingortruncatingthe C-terminal tail or the N-terminal ring.Strikingly, the capistruin sequence wasreadily amenable to changes, with mostvariants folding correctly. Exceptionsincluded a tri-peptide region (Arg11-Val12-Ile13) near the critical asparticacid at position 9 and a single residue inthe prodomain, Thr27, which are presum-ably critical for recognition by the CapBand CapC processing enzymes. Changesto the N-terminal ring, either by the addi-tion or the deletion of a residue, or bychanging the critical cross-linked Asp9to a Glu, are not tolerated, and all suchvariants do not fold correctly. In contrast,the C-terminal tail can be extended byone residue, or truncated by up to threeresidues,withoutdisruptiontothefolding.Furthermore, double and triple mutationsof bulky residues in the C-terminalsegments were produced to investigatethe role of Arg15, Phe16, and Phe18 inpreventing the unfolding of the precursor.Interestingly, Arg15 was found to be thekey residue for keeping the C-terminaltail trapped. The ï¬nding that only a smallsubset of amino acids is required forcorrect folding is consistent with studieson microcin J25; however, for microcinJ25, key residues are located in theN-terminalringandthethreadedsegmentrather than the loop (Pavlova et al., 2008).Thelassopeptidessharesomefeatureswith another family of peptides having acomplex topology, namely the cyclotidesfrom plants (Craik, 2006). Cyclotideshave their N and C termini linked by apeptide bond, creating a seamless pep-tide backbone with no beginning or end.During the initial characterization of alassopeptidemicrocinJ25,itwasmistak-enly believed to be a head-to-tail cyclicpeptidelikethecyclotides,inpartbecauseitcouldbeenzymaticallydigestedwithoutdissociation into two peptide fragments(Rebuffatetal.,2004).Itwassubsequentlyshown that this is because the N-terminalring in microcin J25 wraps so tightlyaround the C-terminal tail that the frag-ments can not be separated under stan-dard analytical conditions (Rosengrenet al., 2003; Bayro et al., 2003; Wilsonet al., 2003).

Novel high-resolution computed tomography-based radiomic classifier for screen-identified pulmonary nodules in the National Lung Screening Trial,"PURPOSE
Optimization of the clinical management of screen-detected lung nodules is needed to avoid unnecessary diagnostic interventions. Herein we demonstrate the potential value of a novel radiomics-based approach for the classification of screen-detected indeterminate nodules.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Independent quantitative variables assessing various radiologic nodule features such as sphericity, flatness, elongation, spiculation, lobulation and curvature were developed from the NLST dataset using 726 indeterminate nodules (all â‰¥ 7 mm, benign, n = 318 and malignant, n = 408). Multivariate analysis was performed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method for variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the multivariate model. The bootstrapping method was then applied for the internal validation and the optimism-corrected AUC was reported for the final model.


RESULTS
Eight of the originally considered 57 quantitative radiologic features were selected by LASSO multivariate modeling. These 8 features include variables capturing Location: vertical location (Offset carina centroid z), Size: volume estimate (Minimum enclosing brick), Shape: flatness, Density: texture analysis (Score Indicative of Lesion/Lung Aggression/Abnormality (SILA) texture), and surface characteristics: surface complexity (Maximum shape index and Average shape index), and estimates of surface curvature (Average positive mean curvature and Minimum mean curvature), all with P<0.01. The optimism-corrected AUC for these 8 features is 0.939.


CONCLUSIONS
Our novel radiomic LDCT-based approach for indeterminate screen-detected nodule characterization appears extremely promising however independent external validation is needed.",2018,PLoS ONE
The effects of phytosanitary hot water treatments on West African mangoes infested with Bactrocera invadens (Diptera: Tephritidae).,"Introduction . Quarantine heat treatments have not yet been introduced in West Africa and no work has been done to determine the treatment conditions needed to eliminate eggs and larvae of West African fruit fly populations, especially of the new species Bactrocera invadens , from mangoes produced in the region. The objective of our study was to carry out hot water disinfestation experiments on naturally infested mangoes to determine the exposure parameters required to kill eggs and larvae of B.Â invadens present in commercial-quality fruits. The effects of hot water treatment on fruit quality were also investigated. Materials and methods . A tank with a heating element and a water pump equipped with a tank sensor were used. Physiologically mature, hard, green mango fruits (cv. Kent) with potential export quality but infested by B.Â invadens were harvested from plantations in the Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) area. The effect of hot water treatment by immersion at 42.0Â Â°C, 46.5Â Â°C or 51.0Â Â°C was evaluated by counting identifiable sites of fruit fly oviposition before and after paring the fruit and, finally, the numbers of live and dead larvae of B. invadens were counted in the pulp. The quality of the fruit was evaluated after the hot water immersion. Results and discussion . A hot water treatment resulting in a core temperature of 46.5Â Â°C could be the basis of a fruit fly quarantine treatment for West African mangoes produced in Burkina Faso. All of the larvae extracted from the fruits treated at 46.5Â Â°C and 51.0Â Â°C were dead, while, in fruit treated at 42.0Â Â°C, only about one-third of the larvae extracted were dead.",2012,Fruits
Non-inducibility of AF post electrophysiologically based PV isolation predicts freedom from AF,"Background: Recently, various anatomic and electrophysiologic approaches to pulmonary vein (PV) isolation have shown variable efficacy in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Whether inducibility of AF after achieving prespecified electrophysiologic endpoints of PV isolation is a useful predictor of AF recurrence is unknown. Methods: This study included 105 consecutive patients who underwent PV isolation for the treatment of symptomatic AF and were followed for a mean of 327 days. Patients were 54 /11 years of age, 72% were males, 46% had hypertension, 15% had valvular heart disease (VHD), 10% had cardiomyopathy, 40% had persistent or permanent AF, and 60% were on antiarrhythmic agents. Complete isolation of all 4 PVs was confirmed by demonstration of bi-directional block across the ablation lines: a) loss of PV potentials and b) failure to capture the LA by pacing 10-14 bipolar pairs of electrodes of the Lasso catheter placed at the entrance of the PV at 10 mA. Induction of AF by burst pacing from the HRA and/or CS on/off Isoproterenol (1-10mcg/min) was attempted after PV isolation. AF was inducible in 61% of patients and was sustained ( 1 minute) in 42% of patients. Clinical follow up included assessment of asymptomatic or symptomatic AF by 2 week event recorder and 24 hour holter monitor at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Predictors of freedom from AF recurrence at 6 and 12 months were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Freedom from asymptomatic or symptomatic AF was present in 72% of patients at 6 months and 67% of patients at 12 months. Symptomatic improvement (90% reduction in symptoms) was present in 88% and 87% of patients at 6 and 12 months. In multivariable analysis, freedom from AF at 6 months was predicted by non-inducibility post PV isolation (OR: 5.48, p: 0.05) and absence of VHD (OR: 6.44, p: 0.03). Freedom from AF at 12 months was predicted by non-inducibility post PV isolation (OR: 39.32, p: 0.01), absence of VHD (OR: 8.28, p: 0.04), and absence of hypertension (OR: 10.73, p: 0.03). Conclusion: After complete PV isolation for AF, non-inducibility of AF in the electrophysiology laboratory predicts maintenance of sinus rhythm.",2005,Heart Rhythm
Nonlinear System Identification of Aeroelastic Systems: A Structure-detection Approach,"Identification methods for NARMAX models are applied to aeroelastic dynamics and its properties demonstrated via continuous-time simulations and experimental conditions. Identification of parametric nonlinear models involves estimating unknown parameters and detecting its underlying structure. Structure computation is concerned with selecting a subset of parameters to give a parsimonious description of the system that may afford greater insight into the functionality of the system or a simpler controller design. Structure-detection methods applicable to NARMAX modeling are applied to aeroelastic dynamics. Among other methods, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique is investigated for computing efficient model descriptions of nonlinear systems. Simulation results from a nonlinear dynamic aircraft model demonstrate that methods developed for NARMAX structure computation provide good accuracy for selection of the exact model structure from an over-parameterized model description. Applicability of the method to more complex systems such as those encountered in aerospace applications is shown by identifying parsimonious system descriptions of the F/A-18 active aeroelastic wing (AAW) using flight-test data.",2007,
Weighted General Group Lasso for Gene Selection in Cancer Classification,"Relevant gene selection is crucial for analyzing cancer gene expression datasets including two types of tumors in cancer classification. Intrinsic interactions among selected genes cannot be fully identified by most existing gene selection methods. In this paper, we propose a weighted general group lasso (WGGL) model to select cancer genes in groups. A gene grouping heuristic method is presented based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis. To determine the importance of genes and groups, a method for calculating gene and group weights is presented in terms of joint mutual information. To implement the complex calculation process of WGGL, a gene selection algorithm is developed. Experimental results on both random and three cancer gene expression datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves better classification performance than two existing state-of-the-art gene selection methods.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics
"Science and Ideology Revisited: Necessity, Contingency and the Critique of Ideologies in Meillassoux and Malabou","Abstract:Political thought influenced by post-structuralism rarely invokes ideology critique as a meaningful category of analysis, criticizing the structuralist attribution of contingency and necessity to, respectively, ideology and science. This article will challenge this position utilising recent philosophical considerations of necessity and contingency that rehabilitate ideology critique. Drawing on scientific materials, both Quentin Meillassoux and Catherine Malabou develop a form of necessity inhabited by contingency. It will be argued that this work allows a reconsideration of the usefulness of science for ideology critique in a manner that doesn't rely on an attribution of scientific necessity to the politics of the critic.",2018,Theory & Event
Climate change exacerbates interspecific interactions in sympatric coastal fishes.,"Biological responses to warming are presently based on the assumption that species will remain within their bioclimatic envelope as environmental conditions change. As a result, changes in the relative abundance of several marine species have been documented over the last decades. This suggests that warming may drive novel interspecific interactions to occur (i.e. invasive vs. native species) or may intensify the strength of pre-existing ones (i.e. warm vs. cold adapted). For mobile species, habitat relocation is a viable solution to track tolerable conditions and reduce competitive costs, resulting in 'winner' species dominating the best quality habitat at the expense of 'loser' species. Here, we focus on the importance of warming in exacerbating interspecific interactions between two sympatric fishes. We assessed the relocation response of the cool-water fish Coris julis (a potential 'loser' species in warming scenarios) at increasing relative dominance of the warm-water fish Thalassoma pavo (a 'winner' species). These wrasses are widespread in the Mediterranean nearshore waters. C.Â julis tolerates cooler waters and is found throughout the basin. T.Â pavo is common along southern coasts, although the species range is expanding northwards as the Mediterranean warms. We surveyed habitat patterns along a thermo-latitudinal gradient in the Western Mediterranean Sea and manipulated seawater temperature under two scenarios (present day vs. projected) in outdoor arenas. Our results show that the cool-water species relocates to a less-preferred seagrass habitat and undergoes lower behavioural performance in warmer environments, provided the relative dominance of its warm-water antagonist is high. The results suggest that expected warming will act synergistically with increased relative dominance of a warm-water species to cause a cool-water fish to relocate in a less-preferred habitat within the same thermal environment. Our study highlights the complexity of climate change effects and has broad implications for predictive models of responses to warming. To achieve more accurate predictions, further consideration is needed of the pervasive importance of species interactions. We believe these fundamental issues to be addressed to understand the biotic consequences of climate change.",2013,The Journal of animal ecology
"Interrelationships between egg dimensions, pore numbers, incubation time, and adult body mass in Procellariiformes with special reference to the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica","Dimensions of eggs and eggshells and pore density are reported for eggs of the Antarctic Petrel Thalassoica Antarctica (as well as eggs of the Snow Petrel Pagodroma nivea). Allometric relationships are used to estimate the initial egg mass, total number of pores and incubation time. The initial egg mass for Antarctic Petrel was estimated to 83 g, and the incubation time to 55 days. The total pore number in Antarctic Petrel was estimated to 4212 and in Snow Petrel 2654 pores per egg. Using data from 8 species of Procellariiformes, the relationship between total pore counts, initial egg mass and incubation time is described.",1987,Polar Research
Efficiency and Consistency for Regularization Parameter Selection in Penalized Regression: Asymptotics and Finite-Sample Corrections,"This paper studies the asymptotic and nite-sample performance of penalized regression methods when different selectors of the regularization parameter are used under the assumption that the true model is, or is not, included among the candidate model. In the latter setting, we relax assumptions in the existing theory to show that several classical information criteria are asymptotically efficient selectors of the regularization parameter. In both settings, we assess the nite-sample performance of these as well as other common selectors and demonstrate that their performance can suffer due to sensitivity to the number of variables that are included in the full model. As alternatives, we propose two corrected information criteria which are shown to outperform the existing procedures while still maintaining the desired asymptotic properties. In the non-true model world, we relax the assumption made in the literature that the true error variance is known or that a consistent estimator is available to prove that Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Cp and Generalized cross-validation (GCV) themselves are asymptotically efficient selectors of the regularization parameter and we study their performance in nite samples. In classical regression, AIC tends to select overly complex models when the dimension of the maximum candidate model is large relative to the sample size. Simulation studies suggest that AIC suffers from the same shortcomings when used in penalized regression. We therefore propose the use of the classical AICc as an alternative. In the true model world, a similar investigation into the nite sample properties of BIC reveals analogous overfitting tendencies and leads us to further propose the use of a corrected BIC (BICc). In their respective settings (whether the true model is, or is not, among the candidate models), BICc and AICc have the desired asymptotic properties and we use simulations to assess their performance, as well as that of other selectors, in nite samples for penalized regressions fit using the Smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalty functions. We nd that AICc and 10-fold cross-validation outperform the other selectors in terms of squared error loss, and BICc avoids the tendency of BIC to select overly complex models when the dimension of the maximum candidate model is large relative to the sample size.",2011,

Breeding Biology of Starling in a Dovecote of the Lombard Plain. Results are given concer- ning a research carried out in 1991 on the reproductive biology of a population of Sturnus vulgaris breeding in a farm dovecote in the central Po Plain. Nest building began between 15~(th) March and 2~(th) April. Nests were completed within an average period of 4.6 days (2-9) in 20.4% of the 338 available cavities. An average period of 2.6 days (0-10) elapsed from nest completion to the beginning of egg laying. The ã€Šfirstã€‹ clutches started betweed 22 March (an early data among European records) and 9 April: the beginning of the ã€Šintermediateã€‹ clutches was between 24 April and 11 June; ã€Šsecondã€‹ clutches started between 29 April and 16 June. The average chutch size was 5,4 eggs (3-8). The average egg size was 29.5Ã—21.2 mm, with an average weight of 6.9 grams (n= 148). The average incubation period was 12.2 day (11-15), the average nestling feeding period took 15.5 (13-22) days, with a significant difference between first clutches (19.1) and the following one (14.9). The mean number of nestlings per clutch at hatching was 4.5 (1-7); the mean number of fledgling youngs per clutch was 3.3 (1-6). The hatching rate mean number of fledgling youngs per clutch was 3.3 (1-6). The hatching rate mean number of fledgling youngs per clutch was 3.3. (1-6). The hatching rate was 71.2% and fledging rate 47.5%; in both cases the highest values correspond to the clutches of 6 eggs. The average breeding success was 33,8%, with 1.9 youngs per clutch and a significant difference between first clutches (0.8) and the follo- wing ones (intermediate clutches-2.4; second ones=3). The results show the remarkable influence of weather conditions upon breeding progress and, chiefly, upon breeding success.",1992,
A Bootstrap Lasso + Partial Ridge Method to Construct Confidence Intervals for Parameters in High-dimensional Sparse Linear Models,"For high-dimensional sparse linear models, how to construct confidence intervals for coefficients remains a difficult question. The main reason is the complicated limiting distributions of common estimators such as the Lasso. Several confidence interval construction methods have been developed, and Bootstrap Lasso+OLS is notable for its simple technicality, good interpretability, and comparable performance with other more complicated methods. However, Bootstrap Lasso+OLS depends on the beta-min assumption, a theoretic criterion that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new method called Bootstrap Lasso+Partial Ridge (LPR) to relax this assumption. LPR is a two-stage estimator: first using Lasso to select features and subsequently using Partial Ridge to refit the coefficients. Simulation results show that Bootstrap LPR outperforms Bootstrap Lasso+OLS when there exist small but non-zero coefficients, a common situation violating the beta-min assumption. For such coefficients, compared to Bootstrap Lasso+OLS, confidence intervals constructed by Bootstrap LPR have on average 50% larger coverage probabilities. Bootstrap LPR also has on average 35% shorter confidence interval lengths than the de-sparsified Lasso methods, regardless of whether linear models are misspecified. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees of Bootstrap LPR under appropriate conditions and implement it in the R package ""HDCI.""",2017,arXiv: Methodology
Gli effetti dellâ€™introduzione della nuova mappa di pericolositÃ  sulla valutazione del rischio sismico in Italia.,"Lâ€™introduzione di una versione aggiornata della mappa di pericolositÃ  sismica, definita per diversi periodi di ritorno e per svariati valori di ordinate spettrali, porta inevitabilmente a dei cambiamenti sul livello di rischio sismico del costruito italiano. PoichÃ© la relazione tra domanda e capacitÃ  non Ã¨ lineare per tutto il range di periodi di vibrazione strutturale, Ã¨ necessario valutare il cambiamento del livello di rischio sismico calcolando esplicitamente la vulnerabilitÃ  sismica di strutture esistenti con diversi periodi di vibrazione, per diversi stati limite e considerando sia la nuova che la precedente definizione di pericolositÃ . Nel presente lavoro Ã¨ stato eseguito un primo studio degli effetti che lâ€™introduzione di mappe aggiornate della pericolositÃ  sismica potrebbe avere sulla valutazione dei livelli di rischio sismico nel territorio italiano. Le caratteristiche generali del costruito sono state ricavate dai dati del 14Â° Censimento Generale della Popolazione e delle Abitazioni (ISTAT 2001), mentre una procedura probabilistica di valutazione sismica per edifici esistenti a scala urbana Ã¨ stata impiegata per stimare la capacitÃ . Sono stati considerati tutti i tre stati limite prescritti dallâ€™Ordinanza (danno lieve, danno severo, collasso) in corrispondenza dei rispettivi valori di domanda, cosÃ¬ come il cambiamento delle forme spettrali in funzione della localizzazione e del periodo di ritorno. I risultati dimostrano che la nuova mappa di pericolositÃ  sismica porta a dei livelli di rischio sismico piÃ¹ realistici e meno allarmanti, rendendo leggermente meno gravoso, anche se non privo di problematiche, il panorama attuale di rischio in Italia.",2007,

Predictive models composed by radiomic features extracted from multi-detector computed tomography images for predicting low- and high- grade clear cell renal cell carcinoma,"Abstract To evaluate the values of conventional image features (CIFs) and radiomic features (RFs) extracted from multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) images for predicting low- and high-grade clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Two hundred twenty-seven patients with ccRCC were retrospectively recruited. Five hundred seventy features including 14 CIFs and 556 RFs were extracted from MDCT images of each ccRCC. The CIFs were extracted manually and RFs by the free softwareâ€”MaZda. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) was applied to shrink the high-dimensional data set and select the features. Five predictive models for predicting low- and high-grade ccRCC were constructed by the selected CIFs and RFs. The 5 models were as follows: model of minimum mean squared error (minMSE) of CIFs (CIF-minMSE), minMSE of cortico-medullary phase (CMP) of kidney (CMP-minMSE), minMSE of parenchyma phase (PP) of kidney (PP-minMSE), the combined model of CIF-minMSE and CMP-minMSE (CIF-CMP-minMSE), and the combined model of CIF-minMSE and PP-minMSE (CIF-PP-minMSE). The Lasso regression equation of each model was constructed, and the predictive values were calculated. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of predictive values of the 5 models were drawn by SPSS19.0, and the areas under the curves (AUCs) were calculated. According to Lasso regression, 12, 19 and 10 features were respectively selected from the CIFs, RFs of CMP image and that of PP images to construct the 5 predictive models. The models ordered by their AUCs from large to small were CIF-CMP-minMSE (AUC: 0.986), CIF-PP-minMSE (AUC: 0.981), CIF-minMSE (AUC: 0.980), CMP-minMSE (AUC: 0.975), and PP-minMSE (AUC: 0.963). The maximum diameter of the largest axial section of ccRCC had a maximum weight in predicting the grade of ccRCC among all the features, and its cutoff value was 6.15â€Šcm with a sensitivity of 0.901, a specificity of 0.963, and an AUC of 0.975. When combined with CIFs, RFs extracted from MDCT images contributed to the larger AUC of the predictive model, but were less valuable than CIFs when used alone. The CIF-CMP-minMSE was the optimal predictive model. The maximum diameter of the largest axial section of ccRCC had the largest weight in all features.",2019,Medicine
Seagrasses in the Chagos archipelago,"Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forsk.) den Hartog is more extensively distributed in the Chagos Archipelago than previously reported, and a second seagrass, Halophila decipiens, Ostenfeld is reported from a single locality. Extensive meadows of Thalassodendron are confined to the submerged banks to the north of the Great Chagos Bank and to the lagoon reef-flat of the Diego Garcia atoll to the south. Vast areas of apparently suitable substrates around the other atolls and the few islands on the Bank itself are totally uncolonised by seagrasses. High water temperatures caused by coincidence of extreme low water spring tides and intense midday insolation are suggested as the main reason for the restricted distribution of Thalassodendron around the atolls and islands whilst extreme geographical isolation may explain the very restricted seagrass flora.",1980,Aquatic Botany

FrÃ¥gestÃ¤llningar: Hur har matematikundervisningen i geometri utvecklats? Hur visar sig matematikimplementeringen i barnens dokumentation? Hur har matematikundervisningen utvecklats fÃ¶r barn i behov av sÃ¤rskilt stÃ¶d? Teori: Teori om utvÃ¤rdering beskrivs och tillÃ¤mpas i studien genom Programteori som anvÃ¤nts av Lander och Giota, 2006, Pawson och Tiller, 2005 samt Vedung, 2009. Barns perspektiv pÃ¥ sitt lÃ¤rande finns med genom att det Ã¤r barnens svar pÃ¥ intervjuerna som bearbetats och leder till resultatet. FÃ¶r att se hur barn lÃ¤r, anvÃ¤nds ett sociokulturellt perspektiv (SÃ¤ljÃ¶, 2011) i studien som tar hÃ¤nsyn till barns individuella lÃ¤rande i fÃ¶rskolans miljÃ¶. Metod: Denna studie pÃ¥bÃ¶rjades lÃ¤sÃ¥ret 2010-11 med en satsning i fÃ¶rskolan pÃ¥ matematikundervisningen. Det innebar kollektiv och individuell fortbildning, fÃ¶r alla fÃ¶rskollÃ¤rare och barnskÃ¶tare i en kommun, som ledde fram till en Matematikplattform. Denna plattform utvÃ¤rderades inom omrÃ¥det geometri vÃ¥ren 2012. Metoden var barnintervjuer och att samla in dokumentation till en fÃ¶rutvÃ¤rdering. VÃ¥ren 2015 har en ny utvÃ¤rdering gjorts med nya intervjuer och dokumentation av fÃ¶rskollÃ¤rare och barn, fÃ¶r att se vilka fÃ¶rÃ¤ndringar som har skett. Med Programteorin Ã¤r studien upplagd med en fÃ¶rutvÃ¤rdering, med fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ttningarna fÃ¶r utvÃ¤rderingen, och sedan sjÃ¤lva utvÃ¤rderingen som leder till resultatet i studien. Resultat: StrÃ¤van genom arbetet Ã¤r att visa pÃ¥ skillnaderna i undervisning mellan 2012 och 2015 efter att lÃ¤roplanen i fÃ¶rskolan reviderats. Det visar sig i denna studies resultat, att undervisningen i vardagen har Ã¶kat fÃ¶r barnen och att barnen genom denna lÃ¤rt sig att argumentera, resonera och fÃ¶rklara geometriska begrepp. Resultatet visar att den Ã¶kade kunskapen hos personalen har stÃ¤rkt vardagslÃ¤randet med geometribegrepp och en Ã¶kad medvetenhet fÃ¶r att lÃ¤ra barnen om geometri vid flera olika tillfÃ¤llen i vardagen. Specialpedagogiska konsekvenser: FÃ¶r barn med sprÃ¥ksvÃ¥righeter, neuropsykiatriska symptom eller utvecklingsstÃ¶rning, blir matematikundervisningen mer problematisk.

Typification of the Linnaean name Bignonia peruviana (Vitaceae),"Vitaceae Juss. is a family of 15 genera and about 750 species mainly distributed in tropical regions of Asia, Africa, Australia, the neotropics, and the Pacific islands, with a few genera [ Vitis Linnaeus (1753: 202), Parthenocissus Planchon [1887: 447(â€“448)], Ampelopsis Michaux (1803: 159), and Nekemias Rafinesque (1838: 87)] occurring in temperate regions (APGIII 2009, Wen 2007, Wen et al. 2014). The family is well known for its economical importance since several species, especially Vitis vinifera Linnaeus (1753: 202) and several artificial hybrids of Vitis , are important sources of grapes, wine, and raisins (Ardenghi et al. 2014). Bignonia peruviana Linnaeus (1753: 625), one of the 19 Vitaceae names published by Carl Linnaeus (see Jarvis 2007) appears to be yet untypified, and is here investigated as part of ongoing studies on: (1) Linnaean types (by D.

Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks Using Bayesian Nonparametric Regression and Topology Information,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play an important role in cellular systems and are important for understanding biological processes. Many algorithms have been developed to infer the GRNs. However, most algorithms only pay attention to the gene expression data but do not consider the topology information in their inference process, while incorporating this information can partially compensate for the lack of reliable expression data. Here we develop a Bayesian group lasso with spike and slab priors to perform gene selection and estimation for nonparametric models. B-spline basis functions are used to capture the nonlinear relationships flexibly and penalties are used to avoid overfitting. Further, we incorporate the topology information into the Bayesian method as a prior. We present the application of our method on DREAM3 and DREAM4 datasets and two real biological datasets. The results show that our method performs better than existing methods and the topology information prior can improve the result.",2017,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine
