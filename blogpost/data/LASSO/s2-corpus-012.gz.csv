The Archaeological Urban Survey of Sagalassos (southâ€west Turkey): the Possibilities and Limitations of Surveying a â€˜nonâ€typicalâ€™ Classical Site,"Summary. The merits of surface survey as a non-destructive method of investigating ancient regions and towns are widely acknowledged, as is the lack of â€˜cookbook strategiesâ€™ for this type of research. For the urban survey of the Roman town of Sagalassos (South-West Turkey), a site-specific field strategy was developed to study the functional organization and spatial evolution of the urban area. The location of the town on a steeply sloping and uncultivated site presented a totally different situation from any dealt with in other Mediterranean urban surveys. This paper outlines the development of a survey strategy for the town through a process of trial and error. Reliable results were obtained by combining research techniques and acknowledging the impact of site formation processes and post-depositional disturbances upon the surface record.",2005,Oxford Journal of Archaeology
Bayesian Variable Selection Regression of Multivariate Responses for Group Data,"We propose two multivariate extensions of the Bayesian group lasso for variable selection and estimation for data with high dimensional predictors and multi-dimensional response variables. The methods utilize spike and slab priors to yield solutions which are sparse at either a group level or both a group and individual feature level. The incorporation of group structure in a predictor matrix is a key factor in obtaining better estimators and identifying associations between multiple responses and predictors. The approach is suited to many biological studies where the response is multivariate and each predictor is embedded in some biological grouping structure such as gene pathways. Our Bayesian models are connected with penalized regression, and we prove both oracle and asymptotic distribution properties under an orthogonal design. We derive efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms for our models and provide the implementation in a comprehensive R package called MBSGS available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). The performance of the proposed approaches is compared to state-of-the-art variable selection strategies on simulated data sets. The proposed methodology is illustrated on a genetic dataset in order to identify markers grouping across chromosomes that explain the joint variability of gene expression in multiple tissues.",2017,Bayesian Analysis
Essays in High Dimensional Time Series Analysis,"Essays in High Dimensional Time Series Analysis Kashif Yousuf Due to the rapid improvements in the information technology, high dimensional time series datasets are frequently encountered in a variety of fields such as macroeconomics, finance, neuroscience, and meteorology. Some examples in economics and finance include forecasting low frequency macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP or inflation rate, or financial asset returns using a large number of macroeconomic and financial time series and their lags as possible covariates. In these settings, the number of candidate predictors (pT ) can be much larger than the number of samples (T ), and accurate estimation and prediction is made possible by relying on some form of dimension reduction. Given this ubiquity of time series data, it is surprising that few works on high dimensional statistics discuss the time series setting, and even fewer works have developed methods which utilize the unique features of time series data. This chapter consists of three chapters, and each one is self contained. The first chapter deals with high dimensional predictive regressions which are widely used in economics and finance. However, the theory and methodology is mainly developed assuming that the model is stationary with time invariant parameters. This is at odds with the prevalent evidence for parameter instability in economic time series. To remedy this, we present two L2 boosting algorithms for estimating high dimensional models in which the coefficients are modeled as functions evolving smoothly over time and the predictors are locally stationary. The first method uses componentwise local constant estimators as base learner, while the second relies on componentwise local linear estimators. We establish consistency of both methods, and address the practical issues of choosing the bandwidth for the base learners and the number of boosting iterations. In an extensive application to macroeconomic forecasting with many potential predictors, we find that the benefits to modeling time variation are substantial and are present across a wide range of economic series. Furthermore, these benefits increase with the forecast horizon and with the length of the time series available for estimation. This chapter is jointly written with Serena Ng. The second chapter deals with high dimensional non-linear time series models, and deals with the topic of variable screening/targeting predictors. Rather than assume a specific parametric model a priori, this chapter introduces several model free screening methods based on the partial distance correlation and developed specifically to deal with time dependent data. Methods are developed both for univariate models, such as nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous predictors (NARX), and multivariate models such as linear or nonlinear VAR models. Sure screening properties are proved for our methods, which depend on the moment conditions, and the strength of dependence in the response and covariate processes, amongst other factors. Finite sample performance of our methods is shown through extensive simulation studies, and we show the effectiveness of our algorithms at forecasting US market returns. This chapter is jointly written with Yang Feng. The third chapter deals with variable selection for high dimensional linear stationary time series models. This chapter analyzes the theoretical properties of Sure Independence Screening (SIS), and its two stage combination with the adaptive Lasso, for high dimensional linear models with dependent and/or heavy tailed covariates and errors. We also introduce a generalized least squares screening (GLSS) procedure which utilizes the serial correlation present in the data. By utilizing this serial correlation when estimating our marginal effects, GLSS is shown to outperform SIS in many cases. For both procedures we prove two stage variable selection consistency when combined with the adaptive Lasso.",2019,
Efficient selection of multiple objects on a large scale,"The task of multiple object selection (MOS) in immersive virtual environments is important and still largely unexplored. The difficulty of efficient MOS increases with the number of objects to be selected. E.g. in small-scale MOS, only a few objects need to be simultaneously selected. This may be accomplished by serializing existing single-object selection techniques. In this paper, we explore various MOS tools for large-scale MOS. That is, when the number of objects to be selected are counted in hundreds, or even thousands. This makes serialization of single-object techniques prohibitively time consuming. Instead, we have implemented and tested two of the existing approaches to 3-D MOS, a brush and a lasso, as well as a new technique, a magic wand, which automatically selects objects based on local proximity to other objects. In a formal user evaluation, we have studied how the performance of the MOS tools are affected by the geometric configuration of the objects to be selected. Our studies demonstrate that the performance of MOS techniques is very significantly affected by the geometric scenario facing the user. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a good match between MOS tool shape and the geometric configuration is not always preferable, if the applied tool is complex to use.",2012,
Who's Afraid of Itten: Using the Art Theory of Color Combination to Analyze Emotions in Abstract Paintings,"Color plays an essential role in everyday life and is one of the most important visual cues in human perception. In abstract art, color is one of the essential means to convey the artist's intention and to affect the viewer emotionally. However, colors are rarely experienced in isolation, rather, they are usually presented together with other colors. In fact, the expressive properties of two-color combinations have been extensively studied by artists. It is intriguing to try to understand how color combinations in abstract paintings might affect the viewer emotionally, and to investigate if a computer algorithm can learn this mechanism.
 In this work, we propose a novel computational approach able to analyze the color combinations in abstract paintings and use this information to infer whether a painting will evoke positive or negative emotions in an observer. We exploit art theory concepts to design our features and the learning algorithm. To make use of the color-group information, we propose inferring the emotions elicited by paintings based on the sparse group lasso approach. Our results show that a relative improvement of between 6% and 8% can be achieved in this way. Finally, as an application, we employ our method to generate Mondrian-like paintings and do a prospective user study to evaluate the ability of our method as an automatic tool for generating abstract paintings able to elicit positive and negative emotional responses in people.",2015,
Abstract B14: Rapid RNA-based histotyping of ovarian carcinomas,"Background: Ovarian cancer is a series of distinct diseases typically identified by their histopathological appearance as high-grade serous (HGSC; 70% of cases), low-grade serous (LGSC; 5%), endometrioid (ENOCa, 8%), clear cell (CCC, 12%), and mucinous (MC; 5%) carcinomas. Each type has defining molecular events, gene/protein expression patterns, genetic risk factors, sites of origin, and responses to treatment. Gold standard treatment is surgery followed by platinum-taxane chemotherapy despite mounting evidence suggesting CCCs, MCs, and LGSCs are largely platinum-taxane resistant. If outcomes are to be improved, it is critical to adopt a type specific strategy. Retrospective review studies have suggested histotype may be misdiagnosed or omitted in up to 30% of cases. However, pathological diagnosis of histotypes has been greatly refined in recent years and the use of biomarkers as aides is becoming more widespread. Nonetheless a rapid and fully objective classifier of histotypes will undoubtedly improve diagnostic accuracy, especially in the case of pre-surgical biopsies where small amounts of material present a challenge.

Methods: Over 1000 ovarian carcinoma samples underwent expert gynecopathological review to establish a gold standard diagnosis for the 5 major carcinoma types. RNA was extracted from FFPE tissues and levels of a pre-selected set of >100 genes were quantified using the NanoString GX system. Cohort was split with ~1/3 set aside for independent validation. Several statistical models were tested to generate a prediction algorithm for histological type including PAM, Random Forest, Lasso, Recursive Partitioning, and Discriminant Analysis. Feature selection methods and prediction error were examined using cross-validation in the train /test series prior to validation in the independent set.

Results: Preliminary analysis suggests classification of the 5 major histotypes is possible using NanoString derived RNA expression levels. Accuracy appears to be equivalent to interobserver variation amongst expert gynecopathologist.

Conclusions: The NanoString GX platform provides a stable and reproducible platform on which a robust single sample histological type classifier can be established. Our algorithm combined with the NanoString platform provides a rapid, and cost-effective option that does not require modification to current pathology lab tissue processing protocols. Diagnostic prediction require little material and is applicable to pre- and post- surgical specimens where an objective measure is desired to confirm diagnosis or aide in especially challenging cases.

Risk estimation for high-dimensional lasso regression,"In high-dimensional estimation, analysts are faced with more parameters $p$ than available observations $n$, and asymptotic analysis of performance allows the ratio $p/n\rightarrow \infty$. This situation makes regularization both necessary and desirable in order for estimators to possess theoretical guarantees. However, the amount of regularization, often determined by one or more tuning parameters, is integral to achieving good performance. In practice, choosing the tuning parameter is done through resampling methods (e.g. cross-validation), generalized information criteria, or reformulating the optimization problem (e.g. square-root lasso or scaled sparse regression). Each of these techniques comes with varying levels of theoretical guarantee for the low- or high-dimensional regimes. However, there are some notable deficiencies in the literature. The theory, and sometimes practice, of many methods relies on either the knowledge or estimation of the variance parameter, which is difficult to estimate in high dimensions. In this paper, we provide theoretical intuition suggesting that some previously proposed approaches based on information criteria work poorly in high dimensions. We introduce a suite of new risk estimators leveraging the burgeoning literature on high-dimensional variance estimation. Finally, we compare our proposal to many existing methods for choosing the tuning parameters for lasso regression by providing an extensive simulation to examine their finite sample performance. We find that our new estimators perform quite well, often better than the existing approaches across a wide range of simulation conditions and evaluation criteria.",2016,arXiv: Methodology
MR-based radiomics signature in differentiating ocular adnexal lymphoma from idiopathic orbital inflammation,"ObjectivesTo assess the value of the MR-based radiomics signature in differentiating ocular adnexal lymphoma (OAL) and idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI).MethodsOne hundred fifty-seven patients with pathology-proven OAL (84 patients) and IOI (73 patients) were divided into primary and validation cohorts. Eight hundred six radiomics features were extracted from morphological MR images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) procedure and linear combination were used to select features and build radiomics signature for discriminating OAL from IOI. Discriminating performance was assessed by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). The predictive results were compared with the assessment of radiologists by chi-square test.ResultsFive radiomics features were included in the radiomics signature, which differentiated OAL from IOI with an AUC of 0.74 and 0.73 in the primary and validation cohorts respectively. There was a significant difference between the classification results of the radiomics signature and those of a radiology resident (p < 0.05), although there was no significant difference between the results of the radiomics signature and those of a more experienced radiologist (p > 0.05).ConclusionsRadiomics features have the potential to differentiate OAL from IOI.Key Pointsâ€¢ Clinical and imaging findings of OAL and IOI often overlap, which makes diagnosis difficult.â€¢ Radiomics features can potentially differentiate OAL from IOI non invasively.â€¢ The radiomics signature discriminates OAL from IOI at the same level as an experienced radiologist.",2018,European Radiology
Pulmonary vein isolation: comparison of bipolar and unipolar electrograms at successful and unsuccessful ostial ablation sites.,"INTRODUCTION
No prior studies have quantitatively analyzed the characteristics of bipolar or unipolar electrograms that may be helpful in identifying successful ostial ablation sites in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing segmental pulmonary vein isolation.


METHODS AND RESULTS
The characteristics of bipolar and unipolar electrograms recorded at 185 successful and 120 unsuccessful ostial pulmonary venous ablation sites were analyzed in 21 patients with atrial fibrillation. A decapolar Lasso catheter was positioned near the ostia of the pulmonary veins, and a conventional ablation catheter was used to deliver radiofrequency energy at individual ostial sites where pulmonary vein potentials were recorded. With both bipolar and unipolar recordings, the only timing parameter that distinguished successful from unsuccessful ostial ablation sites was the timing of the electrogram recorded by the ablation catheter relative to the earliest pulmonary vein potential recorded by the Lasso catheter. With both bipolar and unipolar recordings, electrograms demonstrated a larger amplitude at successful than at unsuccessful ablation sites. Unipolar electrograms had a steeper intrinsic deflection at successful than at unsuccessful ostial ablation sites. The morphologies of the unipolar electrograms recorded by the ablation catheter and by the contiguous electrode of the Lasso catheter usually were identical.


CONCLUSION
In patients undergoing segmental isolation of the pulmonary veins, unipolar recordings provide more information than bipolar recordings helpful in distinguishing successful from unsuccessful ostial ablation sites. Furthermore, unipolar recordings, but not bipolar recordings, allow accurate localization of the position of the ablation catheter relative to the electrodes of the Lasso catheter.",2002,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology
A Developmentally Regulated HydroxyprolineRich HydroxyprolineRich HydroxyprolineRich Glycoprotein in Maize Pericarp Cell Walls 1,"We have studied the accumulation of peptidyl hydroxyproline in the pericarp of developing maize (Zea mays L., Golden cross Bantam sweet corn) kernels. Although this hydroxyproline accumulates throughout development, it is most soluble and its content per milligram dry weight greatest at midmaturation stages of development. Salt-soluble proteins containing this hydroxyproline from isolated cell wails of developing kernels were fractionated on a CsCI density gradient and on a Chromatofocusing column, resulting in the purification of an hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein, PC-1. PC-1 is a basic protein of approximately 65 to 70 kilodaltons in molecular weight with an isoelectric point of at least 10.2 and a density of 1.38 to 1.39 in CsCl. Amino acid composition data indicate that it is rich in hydroxyproline, threonine, proline, lysine, and glycine. Its relation to dicot extensin is discussed. Plant form is determined largely by the rigid walls surrounding the cells. In addition, cell walls are important in disease resistance and in protection against physical damage. In the deliberate design of plants with increased resistance to disease and physical damage, we need to know more about how the primary cell wall works. Primary walls constitute a large fraction of edible plants and are therefore the major determinant of the character of dietary fiber. A correct understanding of the nutritional role of fiber, again, requires a more complete understanding of the primary wall. Because of the evolutionary distance of monocots and dicots, differences in cell wall structure between them are likely. As might be expected, the glycoprotein abundance in primary walls differs between dicots and monocots (especially as represented by thegraminaceous cereals), but these differences are not well studied and understood (11). Analysis of cell wall proteins in dicots has suggested possible roles of structural proteins and wallassociated enzymes in growth, development, and defense (16, 20). Similar types of studies with monocots will be equally informative. A structural protein component, extensin, has been characterized in primary walls of several dicot species (16, 20), and molecular biological studies of its expression have begun (20, 23). Extensin is an important component of the cell wall matrix, comprising in some species as much as 18% of the wall's mass (15). A salt-extractable monomer extensin has been isolated from aerated carrot disks (21). This has allowed the characterization of the protein and carbohydrate moieties of the monomer (21, 26) as well as a determination of the time course for its insolubilization in the wall (8). In addition to structural roles, extensins also appear to be involved in the plant's defense against pathogen I Supported by United States Department of Energy grant No. DEFG02-84ER13255 to J. E. V. attack and wounding (6, 18, 19). But just how these rod-like extensin molecules fit into the polysaccharide matrix, become insolubilized, or are involved in defense remains to be elucidated (7). To understand better the role of these interesting cell wall glycoproteins, a study of their similarities and differences and of their developmental regulation in divergent plants is necessary. We used pericarp tissue for this study because it is an important protective tissue and because seed coat/pericarp tissue in many species had been reported by Van Etten et al. (25) to be relatively rich in hydroxyproline. In addition, Boundy et al. (1) extracted peptides from mature dent corn pericarp that were rich in hydroxyproline, although the proteins from which the peptides are derived were not identified. We have isolated and characterized an hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein from maize, a monocot that is widely diverged taxonomically from those plants in which cell wall proteins have been characterized to date. This protein may be developmentally regulated and has an amino acid composition quite different from that of the dicot extensins. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant Material. Golden cross Bantam sweet corn (Zea mays L.) was greenhouse grown and the ears harvested at several times after self pollination. For some experiments, sweet corn at a midmaturation stage of development was obtained from a local supermarket. Cell Wall Preparation. Pericarps (approximately 25 per batch) were peeled from frozen maize seed and the aleurone layer removed. The pericarps were ground in a glass homogenizer with buffer containing 0.1% K-acetate (pH 5.0) and 4 mM Na,S,O,. Walls were washed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) containing 2 mm Na2S2O and were resuspended and centrifuged six times with 5 ml each of cold 2 mM Na2S2O5. The wall pellet was extracted with 2 ml 0.2 M CaCl2 overnight with stirring at 4Â°C. Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoprotein Isolation. For some experiments, solid CsCl was added to the CaC12 extract to final density of 1.4 g cc1. Gradients were established by spinning at 250,000g for 72 h in a Beckman SW-65 Ti rotor. Gradients were fractionated, and hydroxyproline assays and density determinations were performed on the fractions. In other experiments, the CaCl, extract was desalted and concentrated with a Centricon-30 apparatus (Amicon Division, W.R. Grace and Co., Danvers, MA). Proteins were then subjected to fractionation on a Chromatofocusing column (Pharmacia; Uppsala, Sweden). The column was packed with polybuffer exchanger PBE 118 and equilibrated with 0.025 M triethylamine-HCl (pH 11) (TEA). The protein sample was lyophilized and brought to 1 ml in the TEA buffer before being applied to the column. The pH profile was developed with pH 8.0 Pharmalyte pH 8 to 10.5-HCl (Pharmacia). The pH gradient typically ran from 10.5 to 8.0 in 50 to 65 ml elution volume from a 12 x 0.5 cm column. Protein-containing fractions were identified by absorbance at 280 nm. 138 www.plantphysiol.org on January 6, 2018 Published by Downloaded from Copyright Â© 1988 American Society of Plant Biologists.

A new generation scanning system for the high-speed analysis of nuclear emulsions,"The development of automatic scanning systems was a fundamental issue for large scale neutrino detectors exploiting nuclear emulsions as particle trackers. Such systems speed up significantly the event analysis in emulsion, allowing the feasibility of experiments with unprecedented statistics. In the early 1990s, R&D programs were carried out by Japanese and European laboratories leading to automatic scanning systems more and more efficient. The recent progress in the technology of digital signal processing and of image acquisition allows the fulfillment of new systems with higher performances. In this paper we report the description and the performance of a new generation scanning system able to operate at the record speed of 84 cm2/hour and based on the Large Angle Scanning System for OPERA (LASSO) software infrastructure developed by the Naples scanning group. Such improvement, reduces the scanning time by a factor 4 with respect to the available systems, allowing the readout of huge amount of nuclear emulsions in reasonable time. This opens new perspectives for the employment of such detectors in a wider variety of applications.",2016,Journal of Instrumentation
Prediction of treatment benefit in high-dimensional cox models via gene signatures in randomized clinical trials,"Methods We investigated four approaches: penalize biomarker main effects and biomarker-by-treatment interactions using a lasso penalty (full-lasso); control of main effects by principal components or ridge penalty, and lasso on interactions (sPCA+lasso or ridge+lasso); and â€˜modified covariatesâ€™ in a penalized regression model (Tian et al. 2014). We performed simulations under null and alternative scenarios by varying the sample size n, number of biomarkers H, number of true main effects or treatment-modifiers, effect sizes and correlations. We proposed two novel measures of treatment effect prediction for gene signatures: a difference in C-indices and a Wald-based interaction statistic. We used gene expression data from a RCT of adjuvant chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (n=133) for illustration.",2015,Trials

Entre los objetivos secundarios estan determinar la prevalencia de malignidad, la relacion entre una actividad metabolica (SUVmax) baja y el tamano del NPS, y el acuerdo inter- e intra-observador para el tamano y la morfologia del NPS. Metodos Se recopilan un total de 277 pacientes con NPS (147 en la fase retrospectiva y 130 consecutivos en la prospectiva). Se analizan los datos clinicos de edad, sexo, historia previa de malignidad y tabaquismo, diagnostico histologico y de imagen del NP como el tamano, localizacion, morfologia, presencia de grasa, calcio, colas pleurales broncograma, cavitacion, pseudocavitacion, signo del vaso, signo del bronquio y SUVmax.. El diagnostico de benignidad del NPS, en ausencia de histologia, se establecio por la estabilidad en un periodo mayor de 2 anos. Se realizo analisis estadistico e inferencial de las variables. El analisis de regresion logistica con penalizacion L1 (LASSO) selecciono las variables predictivas independientes para la construccion de varios modelos, seleccionando el mejor mediante el criterio de Akaike. La capacidad predictiva del modelo se evalua mediante la estimacion del area bajo la curva (ROC). La validacion interna se realizo mediante la tecnica de remuestreo y la calibracion mediante una grafica de valores observados frente a esperados generada mediante bootstrapping. Se construyo un nomograma para su aplicacion clinica. Resultados La edad media fue de 68,5 anos (65,3% varones, 34,7% mujeres). El 68,9% eran fumadores. La prevalencia de malignidad fue del 47.7%. Los NPS malignos fueron mas frecuentes en varones; y el adenocarcinoma el tipo histologico mas habitual. El analisis de regresion logistica con penalizacion L1 de LASSO identifico como predictores independientes de malignidad a los antecedentes personales de cancer en los 5 anos anteriores, el SUVmax y la pseudocavitacion, y como protectores para benignidad el calcio y la grasa. El AUC del modelo fue de 0.894 y la validacion sobre nuevos datos de 0.886, con una calibracion casi perfecta. El metabolismo debil no estuvo ligado al tamano del NPS. La concordancia inter- e intra-observador fue muy buena. Conclusiones Se ha desarrollado un modelo predictivo de malignidad para los NPS con baja actividad metabolica en PET/TC, con una buena capacidad predictiva (AUC de 0.894, IC 95% de 0,857-0,932) y un AUC validado de 0.886.",2018,
Nonambiguous SAR Image Formation of Maritime Targets Using Weighted Sparse Approach,"For a single-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR), finite-pulse repetition frequency and nonideal antenna pattern cause azimuth ambiguities, i.e., ghosts in image domain. In this paper, a novel algorithm of locating processing weighted group lasso SAR image formation for maritime targets is proposed to effectively mitigate the ambiguities, which can work on a single-look complex SAR image. In the scheme, the ambiguous signal model using the conventional SAR focusing processor is first explicitly derived, showing the analytical expression of SAR image formulation. The weighted sparse group lasso algorithm is then employed to group-sparsely reconstruct the subimages of nonambiguous and ambiguous Doppler components. In particular, we introduce adaptively weighted sparsity constraint, obtained from a priori azimuth antenna pattern, and clutter clustering during sparse imaging. It should be emphasized that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the azimuth resolution by coherently integrating the ambiguous signal components, which greatly helps the target detection and recognition in maritime surveillance. Finally, experiments based on simulated and measured data are performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing
Task-Specific Recognition Signals Are Located on the Legs in a Social Insect,"Task allocation ensures a high level of organization within social insect colonies. Workers reveal their task assignment through cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) signals. The source and chemical composition of these signals are largely unknown. We ask whether task recognition signals are located on particular body parts of workers of Australian meat ants (Iridomyrmex purpureus). We analysed the CHC profile on the antennae, legs and abdomens of workers engaged in different tasks. Discriminant analysis showed that the leg profile is the best indicator of task identification. Behavioural assays confirmed this finding: workers typically reacted differently to non-nestmates engaged in different tasks, but not if the CHCs on the legs of their opponents were removed by a solvent. Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Model (GLMNET) revealed which CHC components show the highest correlation in task and nestmate recognition, suggesting that social insects can simultaneously convey different CHC signals on different body parts, thereby allowing efficient signaling and signal perception.",2019,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution

Generalization Error Minimization: A New Approach to Model Evaluation and Selection with an Application to Penalized Regression,"We study model evaluation and model selection from the perspective of generalization ability (GA): the ability of a model to predict outcomes in new samples from the same population. We believe that GA is one way formally to address concerns about the external validity of a model. The GA of a model estimated on a sample can be measured by its empirical out-of-sample errors, called the generalization errors (GE). We derive upper bounds for the GE, which depend on sample sizes, model complexity and the distribution of the loss function. The upper bounds can be used to evaluate the GA of a model, ex ante. We propose using generalization error minimization (GEM) as a framework for model selection. Using GEM, we are able to unify a big class of penalized regression estimators, including lasso, ridge and bridge, under the same set of assumptions. We establish finite-sample and asymptotic properties (including $\mathcal{L}_2$-consistency) of the GEM estimator for both the $n \geqslant p$ and the $n",2016,arXiv: Machine Learning
Integrating satellite and climate data to predict wheat yield in Australia using machine learning approaches,"Abstract Wheat is the most important staple crop grown in Australia, and Australia is one of the top wheat exporting countries globally. Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction in Australia is important for regional and global food security. Prior studies use either climate data, or satellite data, or a combination of these two to build empirical models to predict crop yield. However, though the performance of yield prediction using empirical methods is improved by combining the use of climate and satellite data, the contributions from different data sources are still not clear. In addition, how the regression-based methods compare with various machine-learning based methods in their performance in yield prediction is also not well understood and needs in-depth investigation. This work integrated various sources of data to predict wheat yield across Australia from 2000 to 2014 at the statistical division (SD) level. We adopted a well-known regression method (LASSO, as a benchmark) and three mainstream machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and neural network) to build various empirical models for yield prediction. For satellite data, we used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from MODIS and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY as metrics to approximate crop productivity. The machine-learning based methods outperform the regression method in modeling crop yield. Our results confirm that combining climate and satellite data can achieve high performance of yield prediction at the SD level (R2 Ëœ 0.75). The satellite data track crop growth condition and gradually capture the variability of yield evolving with the growing season, and their contributions to yield prediction usually saturate at the peak of the growing season. Climate data provide extra and unique information beyond what the satellite data have offered for yield prediction, and our empirical modeling work shows the added values of climate variables exist across the whole season, not only at some certain stages. We also find that using EVI as an input can achieve better performance in yield prediction than SIF, primarily due to the large noise in the satellite-based SIF data (i.e. coarse resolution in both space and time). In addition, we also explored the potential for timely wheat yield prediction in Australia, and we can achieve the optimal prediction performance with approximately two-month lead time before wheat maturity. The proposed methodology in this paper can be extended to different crops and different regions for crop yield prediction.",2019,Agricultural and Forest Meteorology
Internet-Based Motivation Program for Women With Eating Disorders: Eating Disorder Pathology and Depressive Mood Predict Dropout,"BACKGROUND
One of the main problems of Internet-delivered interventions for a range of disorders is the high dropout rate, yet little is known about the factors associated with this. We recently developed and tested a Web-based 6-session program to enhance motivation to change for women with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or related subthreshold eating pathology.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of dropout from this Web program.


METHODS
A total of 179 women took part in the study. We used survival analyses (Cox regression) to investigate the predictive effect of eating disorder pathology (assessed by the Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire; EDE-Q), depressive mood (Hopkins Symptom Checklist), motivation to change (University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale; URICA), and participants' age at dropout. To identify predictors, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method.


RESULTS
The dropout rate was 50.8% (91/179) and was equally distributed across the 6 treatment sessions. The LASSO analysis revealed that higher scores on the Shape Concerns subscale of the EDE-Q, a higher frequency of binge eating episodes and vomiting, as well as higher depression scores significantly increased the probability of dropout. However, we did not find any effect of the URICA or age on dropout.


CONCLUSIONS
Women with more severe eating disorder pathology and depressive mood had a higher likelihood of dropping out from a Web-based motivational enhancement program. Interventions such as ours need to address the specific needs of women with more severe eating disorder pathology and depressive mood and offer them additional support to prevent them from prematurely discontinuing treatment.",2014,Journal of Medical Internet Research

A note on shrinkage sliced inverse regression,"We employ Lasso shrinkage within the context of sufficient dimension reduction to obtain a shrinkage sliced inverse regression estimator, which provides easier interpretations and better prediction accuracy without assuming a parametric model. The shrinkage sliced inverse regression approach can be employed for both single-index and multiple-index models. Simulation studies suggest that the new estimator performs well when its tuning parameter is selected by either the Bayesian information criterion or the residual information criterion.

â€˜Broncoingâ€™: A Uniquely Australian Cattleâ€Handling Technology,"The early Anglo-Celtic settlers in Australia arrived with a 'cattle-culture' developed in Britain over many centuries, but their cattle-handling technology proved inadequate for the unique conditions of Australia and new methods were soon devised. For most of the nineteenth century these new techniques required the use of a yard, but eventually the 'bronco' method was developed which did not require a yard and which involved a specially constructed 'bronco panel' and the use of a lasso thrown by a mounted horseman. This new method became the dominant cattle-handling technique in the outback for nearly a century and is still practised on a small number of cattle stations.",2007,Prometheus
Supernormal catalytic function of microwave radiation in the aging process of pigment materials,"Microwave chemical reaction in pigment materials under electromagnetic pulse conditions have been studied. A new model of rectangular cavity of pigment molecules (such as food dyestuffs, knitwear pigment, pictorial countenance, painted corridor, colour) is presented in studying this kind of reactions. The reaction is studied based on simultaneous no stationary chemical kinetic equations and stationary wave equations. The electron density and electrical field space distribution are necessarily given initially to solve those equations. By the use of Vlassov equation and dispersion law of microwave plasma, the dipole layer effect caused by fluctuation on the pigment membrane has been studied. Furthermore, we propose a new polaron model of electron mobility in pigments and use Lippman-Schwinger equation and S-matrix theory to study the mobility of electrons in pigment materials. The result shows that the thickness of the dipole layer is determined by the disturbance from the wave field and the current. The result is relatively close to the experiments, and some parameters in Arrhenius theory are explained in our work. It is extremely useful to research the aging process of pigment materials radiated by microwave.",2004,"ICMMT 4th International Conference on, Proceedings Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology, 2004."
"LASSO Observations at McDonald (Texas, USA) and OCA/CERGA (Grasse, France). A Preliminary Analysis","Abstract : The LASSO observations between USA and Europe have been made possible with the move of Meteosat 3/P2 toward 50 deg W. Two Lunar Laser Ranging stations participated into the observations : the MLRS at McDonald Observatory (Texas, USA) and OCA/CERGA (Grasse, France). Common sessions were performed since April 30, 1992, and will be continued up to the next Meteosat 3/P2 move further West (planed for January 1993). The preliminary analysis made with the data already collected by the end of November 1992 shows that the precision which can be obtained from LASSO is better than 100 ps, the accuracy depending on how well the stations maintain their time metrology, as well as on the quality of the calibration (still to be made.) For extracting such a precision from the data, the processing has been drastically changed compared to the initial LASSO data analysis. It takes into account all the measurements made, timings on board and echoes at each station. This complete use of the data increased dramatically the confidence into the synchronization results.",1992,
"Adaptive post-Dantzig estimation and prediction for non-sparse ""large $p$ and small $n$"" models","For consistency (even oracle properties) of estimation and model prediction, almost all existing methods of variable/feature selection critically depend on sparsity of models. However, for ``large $p$ and small $n$"" models sparsity assumption is hard to check and particularly, when this assumption is violated, the consistency of all existing estimations is usually impossible because working models selected by existing methods such as the LASSO and the Dantzig selector are usually biased. To attack this problem, we in this paper propose adaptive post-Dantzig estimation and model prediction. Here the adaptability means that the consistency based on the newly proposed method is adaptive to non-sparsity of model, choice of shrinkage tuning parameter and dimension of predictor vector. The idea is that after a sub-model as a working model is determined by the Dantzig selector, we construct a globally unbiased sub-model by choosing suitable instrumental variables and nonparametric adjustment. The new estimation of the parameters in the sub-model can be of the asymptotic normality. The consistent estimator, together with the selected sub-model and adjusted model, improves model predictions. Simulation studies show that the new approach has the significant improvement of estimation and prediction accuracies over the Gaussian Dantzig selector and other classical methods have.",2010,arXiv: Methodology
Overnight surgery in proctologia e tipo di anestesia: nostra esperienza su 320 pazienti,"Nellâ€™ambito della chirurgia proctologica, numerose evidenze dimostrano che lâ€™ anestesia generale associata a quella loco-regionale presenta maggiori vantaggi rispetto allâ€™anestesia spinale. Scopo del nostro studio e stato quello di verificare lâ€™efficacia dellâ€™ anestesia generale associata alla loco-regionale in una serie di pazienti affetti da malattia emorroidaria e ragade anale. 
Pazienti e metodi. Sono stati selezionati pazienti con emorroidi sintomatiche di III e IV grado e ragade anale senza storia di reazioni allergiche o suscettibilita farmacologica naropina, propofol e simili. Tutti i pazienti (gruppo A) sono stati sottoposti ad anestesia generale e loco-regionale. Nei pazienti di controllo (gruppo B) e stata praticata anestesia spinale. Alla fine di ogni intervento chirurgico sono state valutate le complicanze precoci e tardive mediante la classificazione da noi recentemente proposta. 
Risultati. Sono stati inclusi nello studio 320 pazienti, 240 operati per prolasso emorroidario e 80 per ragade anale. Lâ€™anestesia ottenuta e stata sempre soddisfacente e non sono state osservate complicanze post-operatorie permanenti. Fra quelle precoci si e osservata ritenzione urinaria nel 9% dei casi e dolore nel 30%. Fra le complicanze tardive sono state osservate dolore nel 8% e ritenzione urinaria nel 1% dei pazienti. In due casi si e formato un ascesso in corrispondenza del punto dâ€™infiltrazione dellâ€™anestetico locale. Lâ€™effetto dellâ€™anestetico locale e durato in media circa 4-8 ore. 
Conclusioni. La tecnica anestesiologica locale con blocco posteriore, associata ad anestesia generale, si e dimostrata efficace per il trattamento delle piu frequenti patologie proctologiche. Tale metodo ha comportato una bassa incidenza di complicanze precoci e tardive e una piu rapida risoluzione dei postumi clinici legati allâ€™intervento.",2009,Il Giornale di chirurgia
Multiple Heterogeneous Structural Breaks Models and Estimation Methods for Panel Data Analysis,"Author: Biying Wu Erasmus School of Economics, Erasmus University Rotterdam Bachelor thesis Econometrics and Operations Research T paper introduces three panel data models and their estimation methods that take heterogeneous structural breaks in the slope coefficients into consideration. Despite the fact that many empirical studies in various domains suggest the effects of certain factors may be unstable and different across clusters, not many studies have considered the development of such techniques in panel data analysis. Thus, this paper seeks to fill this gap. We model the heterogeneities through a latent group structure and consider both the case of a static group pattern and the case when the group pattern changes after each break. For the static group case, we introduce the grouped adaptive group fused lasso (GAGFL) algorithm with a penalized least squares (PLS) method to estimate the exogenous model, and propose the incorporation with a penalized GMM (PGMM) method to estimate the endogenous model. To deal with the dynamic group pattern, we propose the dynamically grouped heterogeneous structural breaks (DGHB) estimation method. Through two sets of Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that our methods give high accuracy in classifications, breaks detections and coefficients estimations. We further apply our GAGFL with PGMM method to investigate the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow on economic growth. The new evidence we obtained in this application confirms the usefulness of our methods in empirical studies.",2018,
Lobbes: An Algorithm for Sparse-Spike Deconvolution,"This letter proposes an algorithm for solving the sparse-spike deconvolution problem, named Lobbes (Lasso-based binary search for parameter selection). It improves the fast iterative shrinkage and threshold algorithm for Toeplitz-sparse matrix factorization by performing three steps to find a suitable regularization parameter: 1) a normalization procedure over the input data; 2) a binary search step based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; and 3) the elimination of consecutive peaks similar to non-maximum suppression. Such parameter allows us to find a solution with a specified sparsity. We compare our results against the original algorithm and with the known sparse-inducing greedy approach of orthogonal matching pursuit. Relative to state-of-the-art, results demonstrate that Lobbes generates better results: better signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed signal and better result for reflectivity peaks. We also derive a new way to measure the quality of the deconvolution.",2017,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters

[Audit of medical records].,"OBJECTIVE
TO assess the quality of medical records in a university teaching hospital in Africa.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
We conducted a retrospective study at the Souro Sanou University Teaching Hospital of Bobo Dioulasso in Burkina Faso, by randomly selecting 480 medical records from 4 clinical departments (internal medicine, obstetrics & gynaecology, paediatrics and surgery). Items recorded were based mainly on those used by the French agency for the evaluation of health services (now the HAS). Ten physicians were also interviewed about medical file ergonomics file. Descriptive statistics were compiled from the data collected.


RESULTS
Only 368 of the 480 records could be found. Two of the four departments had an adequate record room. Assessment of the overall quality of the files noted that: i) 95 to 100% of the records were in good physical condition; ii) the handwriting in the files was legible in 94 to 100% of the cases; iii) the identity of the staff members making file entries could be determined in 73 to 92% of the cases. A detailed examination of the content of the files revealed that: i) the patient's social and demographic characteristics (name, sex, age, residence, occupation, marital status and religion) were available in 26 to 99% of the cases; ii) the mode of admission was noted in 52 to 88%; iii) the reason for admission was stated in 83 to 100%; iv) the main diagnosis was reported in 68 to 100%; v) surgery notes were found for 93 to 100% of patients who underwent surgery; vi) the disposition on discharge was not found in 31% of the records; vii) the circumstances of death were not recorded for 77% of the patients who died.


CONCLUSION
The quality of medical records at Souro University Teaching Hospital must be improved, through improving staff awareness and regular audits.",2010,Sante
On L-fuzzy !-basically Disconnected Spaces,"Abstract. In this paper L-fuzzy !-closed and L-fuzzy !-open sets areintroduced. Also a new class of L-fuzzy topological space called L-fuzzy!-basically disconnected space is introduced. Several characterizationsand some interesting properties are also given. 1. IntroductionThe fuzzy concept has invaded almost all branches of Mathematics sincethe introduction of the concept by Zadeh[14]. Fuzzy sets have applicationsin many elds such as information [10] and control [11]. The theory of fuzzytopological spaces was introduced and developed by Chang [3] and since thenvarious important notions in classical topology have been extended to fuzzytopological spaces. Rodabaugh [7] discussed normality and the L-fuzzy unitinterval. He [8] also studied fuzzy addition in the L-fuzzy real line. Hoeche [6]studied the characterizations of L-topologies by L-valued neighbourhoods. AnL-fuzzy normal spaces and Tietze extension theorem were discussed by TomashKubiak [13]. The concept of !-open set was studied in [9]. The purpose of thispaper is to introduce L-fuzzy !-closed, L-fuzzy !-open sets and a new classof L-fuzzy topological spaces called L-fuzzy !-basically disconnected space.

In silico analysis of long non-coding RNAs in medulloblastoma and its subgroups,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor with high fatality rate. Recent large-scale studies utilizing genome-wide technologies have sub-grouped medulloblastomas into four major subgroups: wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), group 3, and group 4. However, there has yet to be a global analysis of long non-coding RNAs, a crucial part of the regulatory transcriptome, in medulloblastoma. Here, we performed bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq data from 175 medulloblastoma patients. Differential lncRNA expression sub-grouped medulloblastomas into the four main molecular subgroups. Some of these lncRNAs were subgroup-specific, with a random forest-based machine-learning algorithm identifying an 11-lncRNA diagnostic signature. We also validated the diagnostic signature in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We further identified a 17-lncRNA prognostic model using LASSO based penalized Coxâ€™ PH model (Score HR= 13.6301, 95% CI= 8.857-20.98, logrank p-value=< 2e-16). Our analysis represents the first global lncRNA analysis in medulloblastoma. Our results identify putative candidate lncRNAs that could be evaluated for their functional role in medulloblastoma genesis and progression or as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.",2020,bioRxiv
Model Order Selection for LASSO Fitted Millimeter Wave Vehicular Channel Data,"For analysis of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, a firm understanding of the underlying channel is crucial. Through spatial filtering of narrow beams millimeter wave (mmWave) channels become sparse. As accurate channel models are required, without overfitting channel measurements, we investigate the optimal model order given V2V mmWave channel measurements. We use the complex Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to find a sparse tapped-delay line representation of the measured channel, and apply the Akaike Information Criterion to find the optimal model order. Beyond this optimal order we start to fit measurement noise. Our results show, that for the given measurements, 4 to 8 taps prove to be an ideal model order.",2018,"2018 IEEE 29th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)"

Reverse epidemiology of blood pressure in dialysis patients.,"Agarwal implies that the paradoxicalassociations found between higher blood pressure (BP)values and better survival are limited to prevalent dialy-sis patients [1]. We recently studied a 15-month cohort of40,933 hemodialysis patients and found that high predial-ysis systolic BP conferred survival advantages even afteradjustment for dialysis vintage categories, among others[2]. Shoji et al showed that intradialysis hypotension andorthostatichypotensionafterhemodialysisaresigniï¬cantand independent factors affecting mortality in hemodial-ysis patients [3]. A recent study by Lopez-Gomez et alshowed that a high predialysis BP was frequently ob-servedinthosehemodialysispatientswhohadthehighestinterdialyticweightgain,increasedfoodintake,betternu-tritional status, and improved clinical outcome, includingbetter survival [4]. Hence, we caution against categoricdismissalofthereverseepidemiologyofBP,onlybecausethey appear counterintuitive based on observations fromthe general population. Indeed, the reverse epidemiol-ogy is not restricted to BP, but has also been observedwith regard to obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and hyper-homocysteinemia, among others [5].Moreover, the reverse epidemiology is not restrictedto dialysis patients but may also exist in over 20 mil-lion Americans, including patients with heart failure,advanced age, malignancies, AIDS, and several otherchronic disease states [5]. Therefore, we believe thatthe reverse epidemiology phenomenon deserves a moreglobal and inclusive point of view. Further studies areneededtoexploremechanismsbehindsuchparadoxicas-sociations,andtoassesswhatBPrangeisthebestfordial-ysis patients.

"A further contribution on the biology of the Antarctic flea, Glaciopsyllus antarcticus (Siphonaptera: Ceratophyllidae)","SummaryExperiments showed that adult Antarctic Fleas Gladopsyllus antarcticus preferred dark over light conditions, dry over wet conditions, and fine substrate over coarse substrate. Examination of seabird chicks and collections of nest material indicated that the Southern Fulmar Fulmarus glacialoides, is the major host species of the Antarctic Flea, while Snow Petrels Pagodroma nivea, Cape Petrels Daption capense, Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica, and Wilson's Storm-Petrels Oceanites oceanicus are minor hosts. This is the first report of Antarctic Fleas occuring on either Antarctic Petrels or Wilson's Storm-Petrels. No fleas were found associated with Southern Giant Petrels Macronectes giganteus, Antarctic Skuas Catharacta maccormicki, or Adelie Penguins Pygoscelis adeliae.

"Southeast Asia. Modern and contemporary Southeast Asian art: An anthology. Edited by Nora A. Taylor and Boreth Ly. Ithaca, NY: Cornell Southeast Asia Program Publications, 2012. Pp. 280. Plates, Notes.","Modern and contemporary Southeast Asian art: An anthology Edited by NORA A. TAYLOR and BORETH LY Ithaca, NY: Cornell Southeast Asia Program Publications, 2012. Pp. 280. Plates, Notes. doi:10.1017/S0022463413000167 This overdue anthology is an uneven survey of an uneven field, reflecting the disjointed state of visual art production and discourse across an always tenuous geography. In her introduction, Nora Taylor wisely hoses down expectations of any comprehensive regional survey--indeed, the book's wide historical scope ('modern and contemporary') is matched by its medley of analytical modes and vocabularies. Essays range from forensic speculations on the techniques of a nineteenth-century Siamese muralist, to a psychoanalytic study of films about Khmer Rouge atrocities and commentaries on the latest 'relational' practices in international contemporary art. The breadth testifies not just to a patchy and interdisciplinary field, but also to the region's hitherto underestimated--and now burgeoning--variety of aesthetic modernities. Though an incomplete stock-take of recent scholarship, the anthology's concerns revolve around certain key problems. The incoherence of the region as a site of art practice and study is pivotal, as what Taylor calls the 'fight against generalizations' (p. 4) is complicated by the struggle for visibility of a region doubly marginalised--on the one hand by Euro- and US-centric histories of art, on the other by area studies often indifferent to the visual. But while the volume justly claims to be the first on modern and contemporary Southeast Asian art not connected to some exhibition or symposium, it nonetheless falls short of gathering disciplinary critical mass. The art historians here are outnumbered by others, and yet play a crucial role in linking diverse subject matter. John Clark's opening study of 'transitions to modernity' emphasises the artist's graduation from craftsman to a super-artisanal status. While empirical accounts of such social elevation remain scant in most places, it behooves scholars to consider carefully what 'art' might have meant in this or that place, before considering what modern art has come to mean. Clark's emphasis on professional self-consciousness--as constitutive of an aesthetic modernity mediated by colonial then national institutions and systems of distinction--offers a potentially useful framework for lassoing an unruly field. This would be especially valuable where artists have put old techniques to contemporary purpose, as in the finely wrought rattan sculptures of Sopheap Pich that are so suggestive for co-editor Boreth Ly, or the contemporary Javanese batik examined here by Astri Wright. Another tension animating the volume is that of distance: all authors are conscious of the parallax that attends looking, and writing, from afar, yet those that shine are the ones who waste the least time worrying about it. It is still the case that the most service to a regional art history is done by researchers operating within national frames. Among them here, Patrick Flores (The Philippines) and Lee Weng Choy (Singapore)--surely the region's two most reliable resident scribes--deserve mention. Without making pronouncements about Southeast Asia, their research furnishes regional scholarship with models for thinking through common shapes and problems, offering cogent critiques of national consciousness and policy, without losing sight of regional and global economic histories. Kenneth George's study of Islamic aesthetics in Malaysian modern art, meanwhile, is leavened by fruitful comparison with Indonesia. â€¦",2013,Journal of Southeast Asian Studies
Feature Selecting Hierarchical Neural Network for Industrial System Health Monitoring : Catching Informative Features with LASSO,"Industrial System Health Monitoring relies usually on the monitoring of well-designed features. This requires both, the engineering of reliable features and a good methodology for their analysis. If traditionally, features were engineered based on the physics of the system, recent advances in machine learning demonstrated that features could be automatically learned and monitored. In particular, using Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machines (HELM), based on random features, very good results have already been achieved for health monitoring with training on healthy data only. Yet, although very useful and mathematically sound, random features have little popularity as they contradict the intuition and seem to rely on luck. This tends to increase the â€œblackboxâ€ effect often associated with Machine Learning. To mitigate this, in this paper, we propose to modify the traditional HELM architecture such that, while still relying on random features, only the most useful features among a large population will be selected. Traditional HELM are made of stacked contractive autoencoders with `1or `2-regularisation and of a classifier as last layer. To achieve our objective, we propose to opt for expanding auto-encoders instead, but trained with a strong Group-LASSO regularization. This Group-LASSO regularisation fosters the selection of as few features as possible, making the auto-encoder in reality (or in testing condition) contractive. This deterministic selection provides useful features for health monitoring, without the need of learning or manually engineering them. The proposed approach demonstrates a better performance Gabriel Michau et al.

The group Lasso,"In many applications, the high-dimensional parameter vector carries a structure. Among the simplest is a group structure where the parameter is partitioned into disjoint pieces. This occurs when dealing with factor variables or in connection with basis expansions in high-dimensional additive models as discussed in Chapters 5 and 8. The goal is high-dimensional estimation in linear or generalized linear models being sparse with respect to whole groups.

Combining least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and principal-components analysis for detection of gene-gene interactions in genome-wide association studies,"Variable selection in genome-wide association studies can be a daunting task and statistically challenging because there are more variables than subjects. We propose an approach that uses principal-component analysis (PCA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify gene-gene interaction in genome-wide association studies. A PCA was used to first reduce the dimension of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within each gene. The interaction of the gene PCA scores were placed into LASSO to determine whether any gene-gene signals exist. We have extended the PCA-LASSO approach using the bootstrap to estimate the standard errors and confidence intervals of the LASSO coefficient estimates. This method was compared to placing the raw SNP values into the LASSO and the logistic model with individual gene-gene interaction. We demonstrated these methods with the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 rheumatoid arthritis genome-wide association study data and our results identified a few gene-gene signals. Based on our results, the PCA-LASSO method shows promise in identifying gene-gene interactions, and, at this time we suggest using it with other conventional approaches, such as generalized linear models, to narrow down genetic signals.",2009,BMC Proceedings
AktÃ¶rer och strukturer inom svenska statsvetenskap : En granskning av tre statsvetenskapliga bidrag till aktÃ¶r - strukturdebatten,"The purpose of this essay is to critically review three different contributions to the agency â€“ structure debate from a political science perspective. My opinon is that the agency â€“ structure debate is one of the main problems within the social science. The theories which I will examine are Lennart Berntsons theory from 1974, Lennart Lundquists from 1984 and Walter Carlsnaes from 1992. These political scientists all have different perspectives to the problem. My aim is to compare three theories that is of importance to the problem. But I also want to show that there are problems with each of these theories. No one really solves the problem. I want to shed some light on the different problems which these theories encounter and I also want to show were the solution to these problems might be found.It is obvious that the theories have a similar view on the actor (or agent). Each see the actor as both an individual and a collective, such as a party, state or an organisation. They also see the actor in a constant relation to the society. The two main differences between the theories is when it comes to defining the structures and when it comes to trying to connecting the actor with the structure. Berntson sees the connection as mainly classoriented and this provides valuable knowledge to the debate. However, compared to Berntson, Lundquists theory is more thoroughly worked out when it comes to providing knowledge to how agents are affected by structures. This, I would say, is the biggest advantage with Lundquists theory. Finally, Carlsnaes theory, compared to both Berntson and Lundquist, is the least developed one, at least when it comes to defining both the actor and the structure. Though, I still consider his theory of importance. This is because his contribution to the knowledge on how we might explain structural change.",2008,

Abstract P3-12-07: Pharmacogenetic determinants of aromatase inhibitors pharmacokinetics and side effects: 6-month results of the adjuvant breast cancer longitudinal PHACS study (NCT01127295),"Supported by a PHRC grant (#09-18-005) Background: Recent literature has suggested that germline genetic variants of drug-metabolizing enzymes or CYP19A1 (coding for aromatase) may be involved in the systemic aromatase inhibitors (AI) concentrations or the occurrence of side effects (Hertz et al. Pharmacogenomics 2017). A prospective multicentre 3-year follow-up study was carried out to investigate the relationships between pharmacogenetics (PG), pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicity in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant AI (n=1098) or tamoxifen (n=879). The clinical results and the tamoxifen PG/PK analyses are described elsewhere (abstracts #851544 and #850248). Methods: SNP genotyping of 95 SNPs was performed on the Biomark (Fluidigm) with Taqman assays and was available for 373, 515 and 151 patients treated with anastrozole (ANA), letrozole (LETRO) and exemestane (EXE) respectively. CYP2A6 metaboliser status (MS) (poor, intermediate or normal) was determined based on alleles function (*1, *9, *2) and number of CYP2A6 copies. Trough plasma concentrations of each drug were determined 6 months after the start of the study by UPLC-MS/MS and were available for 342, 463 and 130 patients of the ANA, LETRO and EXE arms. Patients with AI concentrations below the limit of quantification were excluded for non-compliance (9 patients for ANA, 8 patients for LETRO and 7 patients for EXE). Toxicity was measured as a binary outcome (occurrence or worsening of hot flushes, fatigue, pain, arthralgia, vaginal dryness). All genetic associations were adjusted for multiple testing. Results: ANA concentration was significantly higher in patients experiencing pain (p=0.025) and was associated with rs28365063 ( UGT2B7 g.372A>G). LETRO concentrations were strongly associated with CYP2A6 metabolizer status (p=0.0001) but did not differ in patients with or without toxicity. In the EXE arm, patients with hot flushes or arthralgia had a significantly lower level of exemestane (p= 0.0002 and p=0.023 respectively) but since the metabolism of EXE leads to active 17-hydroexemestane, we can hypothesize that the lower EXE concentration is an indirect reflection of the metabolite formation. A SNP (rs2307424) in NR1I3 gene (coding for the constitutive androstane receptor CAR) was associated with EXE concentrations. CAR has been shown to regulate CYP2B6, which is involved in the formation of 6-hydroxy-methyl-exemestane (inactive metabolite). Regarding the relationships between PG and toxicity, in the ANA arm, 3 SNPs of CYP19A1 gene tended to be associated with hot flushes worsening (rs934635) and arthralgia (rs10046 and rs2304463) but did not remain significant after multiple tests correction. In the EXE arm, several SNPs in NR1I3 gene were associated with fatigue. In the LETRO arm, patients with a poor CYP2A6 MS had a higher risk of experiencing depression. Conclusions: Our study confirms the predominant role of CYP2A6 in LETRO PK. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the role of UGT2B7 rs28365063 in ANA and NR1I3 in EXE PK and side effects. These relationships need to be re-evaluated with the drug concentrations obtained during the 3-year follow-up.

The asymptotic results are examined by several simulation studies.",2014,Statistics & Probability Letters
Wavelet-based scalar-on-function finite mixture regression models,"Classical finite mixture regression is useful for modeling the relationship between scalar predictors and scalar responses arising from subpopulations defined by the di ering associations between those predictors and responses. The classical finite mixture regression model is extended to incorporate functional predictors by taking a wavelet-based approach in which both the functional predictors and the component-specific coefficient functions are represented in terms of an appropriate wavelet basis. By using the wavelet representation of the model, the coefficients corresponding to the functional covariates become the predictors. In this setting, there are typically many more predictors than observations. Hence a lasso-type penalization is employed to simultaneously perform feature selection and estimation. Specification of the model is discussed and a fitting algorithm is provided. The wavelet-based approach is evaluated on synthetic data as well as applied to a real data set from a study of the relationship between cognitive ability and di usion tensor imaging measures in subjects with multiple sclerosis.",2016,Computational statistics & data analysis
Spatial distribution of fifty ornamental fish species on coral reefs in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,"The spatial distribution of 50 ornamental fish species from shallow water habitats on coral reefs were investigated using visual census techniques, between latitudes 11-29Â°N in the Red Sea, in Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, and in the adjacent Gulf of Aden in Djibouti. One hundred eighteen transects (each 100Ã—5 m) were examined in 29 sites (3-8 sites per country). A total of 522,523 fish individuals were counted during this survey, with mean abundance of 4428.2 Â± 87.26 individual per 500 mÂ² transect. In terms of relative abundance (RA), the most abundant species were Blue green damselfish, Chromis viridis (RA=54.4%),followed bySea goldie, Pseudanthias squamipinnis (RA= 34.7), Whitetail dascyllus, Dascyllus aruanus (RA= 2.6%), Marginate dascyllus, Dascyllus marginatus (RA= 2.0),Red Sea eightline flasher Paracheilinus octotaenia (RA=1.0),andKlunzinger's wrasse, Thalassoma rueppellii (0.7%). The highest number of species (S) per 500 mÂ² transect was found on reefs at the latitude 20Â° in Saudi Arabia (S=21.8), and the lowest number of species was found at the latitude 15Â° in Djibouti (S=11.11). The highest mean abundance (8565.8) was found on reefs at latitude 20Â° in Saudi Arabia and the lowest mean abundance (230) was found on reefs at latitude 22Â°, also in Saudi Arabia. Whereas, the highest Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index was found in reefs at the latitude 22Â° (H`=2.4) and the lowest was found in reefs at the latitude 20Â° (H`=0.6). This study revealed marked differences in the structure of ornamental fish assemblages with latitudinal distribution. The data support the presence of two major biogeographic groups of fishes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden: the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden group and the group in the northern and central Red Sea. Strong correlations were found between live coral cover and the number of fish species, abundance and Shannon-Wiener Diversity indices, and the strength of these correlations varied among the reefs. A conclusion was done that environmental differences among the reefs and the habitats investigated were important components of abundance variations and species diversity of ornamental fish along latitudinal gradients in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.",2014,ZooKeys
associaÃ§Ã£o de ascaris lumbricoides com a asma e sua distribuiÃ§Ã£o espacial no bairro do pedregal â€“ campina grande â€“ pb,"Ascaris lumbricoides ASSOCIATION WITH ASTHMA AND ITS SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF PEDREGAL CAMPINA GRANDE PB OBJECTIVE: Studying the association between asthma and ascariasis and its spatial distribution in children 2-10 years of age, in the neighborhood of Pedregal Campina Grande PB METHODS: Cross-sectional study between January and November 2007. 1004 questionnaires were administered standard International Study of Asthma And Allergy in Childwood (ISAAC), and delivered the container to collect fecal material. In search of parasites in faeces was used the method of Ritchie, for calculating the parasite load was used Kato-Katz method. Was taken for geographical position of households with a GARMIN GPS device. We used the t test and chi-square (ï£) Pearson and Linear Trend and Logistic Regression, with Odds Ratios (OR) and Confidence Interval (CI). To analyze the spatial database and the geographic coordinates were organized in the program ArcGIS 9.3, was defined a bandwidth of 50 meters and regular grid consisting of 5 x 5 cells. RESULTS: Association of light and heavy parasite loads were significant for all symptoms of asthma (p <0.05). Significant associations were also found between infected and asthma to age, household income, and holders with co infection A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura (p <0.05). The density of the Kernelassociated infection by A. lumbricoides with asthma, showed that there is no homogeneity in the cases distribution, that the clusters tend to focus on the higher areas of the neighborhood, relatively distant from the trench open sewer that runs through the neighborhood. Logistic regression was appropriate to identify the predictors of asthma. CONCLUSION: The low parasite load of infection by A. lumbricoides appeared as a protective factor for asthma and its symptoms while high parasite load, characterized as a risk factor. Analyses Kernel (density and hazard ratio) indicated the locations of highest concentration of contamination by A. lumbricoides, and logistic regression identified the independent variables were statistically significant for the risk of asthma.",2013,
Some bathymetric and geotectonic features of the eastern part of the Indian Ocean,"Abstract Tectonic relations of the mainland of Western Australia are reflected seawards by the topography of both continental shelf and adjacent deep ocean floor respectively. The basic pattern of the mainland is controlled by the early Pre-Cambrian â€œgrainâ€ (fracture and folding trends). The continental shelf is narrow and rocky where these ancient orogenic lines cross it, amd they appear to continue oceanwards in elevations of the deep-sea floor. On the other hand, the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic-tertiary basins (paraliageosynclines) of the mainland (up to 20,000 feet deep) are matched on the shelf by wide sandy, and atoll-rimmed embayments; and seawards again by oceanic basins approaching 3,000 fathoms in depth. Crustal character of the main eastern Indian Ocean suggests a thalasso-craton (here defined as primary oceanic crust), but these marginal intermediate ridges and basins suggests a common evolution with the continent. Formal names have been given to sectors of the West Australian shelf and the deep-sea floor in the eastern part of the Indian Ocean.",1955,Deep Sea Research
Tightening or loosening a pH-sensitive double-lasso molecular machine readily synthesized from an ends-activated [c2]daisy chain,"The ready synthesis of a new double-lasso molecular machine from an ends-activated [c2]daisy chain has been achieved. This original architecture consists of a unique double-lasso structure, where the two macrocycles can slide along the threaded pseudo-macrocycle upon variation of pH. The interlocked structure allows for two very different conformations: at low pH, it has a loose conformation with a big cavity. The interlocked molecule thus behaves like a controllable â€œjump ropeâ€. After deprotonation, the molecule adopts a helical-type tightened conformation with a shrunken cavity. In this conformation, no jump rope movement is possible due to the tightened lasso.",2012,Chemical Science
A Systematic Evaluation of Feature Selection and Classification Algorithms Using Simulated and Real miRNA Sequencing Data,"Sequencing is widely used to discover associations between microRNAs (miRNAs) and diseases. However, the negative binomial distribution (NB) and high dimensionality of data obtained using sequencing can lead to low-power results and low reproducibility. Several statistical learning algorithms have been proposed to address sequencing data, and although evaluation of these methods is essential, such studies are relatively rare. The performance of seven feature selection (FS) algorithms, including baySeq, DESeq, edgeR, the rank sum test, lasso, particle swarm optimistic decision tree, and random forest (RF), was compared by simulation under different conditions based on the difference of the mean, the dispersion parameter of the NB, and the signal to noise ratio. Real data were used to evaluate the performance of RF, logistic regression, and support vector machine. Based on the simulation and real data, we discuss the behaviour of the FS and classification algorithms. The Apriori algorithm identified frequent item sets (mir-133a, mir-133b, mir-183, mir-937, and mir-96) from among the deregulated miRNAs of six datasets from The Cancer Genomics Atlas. Taking these findings altogether and considering computational memory requirements, we propose a strategy that combines edgeR and DESeq for large sample sizes.",2015,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine
Spatio Temporal EEG Source Imaging with the Hierarchical Bayesian Elastic Net and Elitist Lasso Models,"The estimation of EEG generating sources constitutes an Inverse Problem (IP) in Neuroscience. This is an ill-posed problem due to the non-uniqueness of the solution and regularization or prior information is needed to undertake Electrophysiology Source Imaging. Structured Sparsity priors can be attained through combinations of (L1 norm-based) and (L2 norm-based) constraints such as the Elastic Net (ENET) and Elitist Lasso (ELASSO) models. The former model is used to find solutions with a small number of smooth nonzero patches, while the latter imposes different degrees of sparsity simultaneously along different dimensions of the spatio-temporal matrix solutions. Both models have been addressed within the penalized regression approach, where the regularization parameters are selected heuristically, leading usually to non-optimal and computationally expensive solutions. The existing Bayesian formulation of ENET allows hyperparameter learning, but using the computationally intensive Monte Carlo/Expectation Maximization methods, which makes impractical its application to the EEG IP. While the ELASSO have not been considered before into the Bayesian context. In this work, we attempt to solve the EEG IP using a Bayesian framework for ENET and ELASSO models. We propose a Structured Sparse Bayesian Learning algorithm based on combining the Empirical Bayes and the iterative coordinate descent procedures to estimate both the parameters and hyperparameters. Using realistic simulations and avoiding the inverse crime we illustrate that our methods are able to recover complicated source setups more accurately and with a more robust estimation of the hyperparameters and behavior under different sparsity scenarios than classical LORETA, ENET and LASSO Fusion solutions. We also solve the EEG IP using data from a visual attention experiment, finding more interpretable neurophysiological patterns with our methods.

Untersuchung zur Pharmakokinetik der Methylxanthine Coffein und Theobromin hinsichtlich der Dopingrelevanz beim Pferd,"The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic behaviour of
 caffeine and theobromine and to optimise and validate a suitable method for
 the analyses for detection and quantification of caffeine, theobromine and
 the metabolites theophylline and paraxanthine in blood and urine samples of
 horses.
 Validation and measurement of samples occurred by using a high
 performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with connected
 tandem-mass-spectrometer. Validation contained the criteria selectivity,
 linearity, accuracy, precision, stability and recovery. The limit of
 quantification for caffeine, theobromine and theophylline was fixed at 100
 ng/ml in plasma and at 50 ng/ml for caffeine, theophylline and paraxanthine
 in urine. The limit of quantification for theobromine was fixed at 100 ng/ml.
 The limit of detection was fixed at 14 ng/ml for caffeine, 15 ng/ml for theobromine
 and 13 ng/ml for theophylline. In urine the limit of detection was fixed at
 33 ng/ml for caffeine, 26 ng/ml for theobromine, 20 ng/ml for theophylline
 and 32 ng/ml for paraxanthine.
 In the first part of the pharmacokinetic experiment caffeine was
 administered at a single intravenous dose of 4 mg/kg body weight to six horses.
 The maximum concentrations of caffeine in plasma ranged between 4410 and
 12237 ng/ml. The maximum concentrations of caffeine in urine ranged between
 5704 and 12053 ng/ml. 144 hours after administration the concentrations in
 plasma and urine of all six horses were below limit of detection. In plasma
 and urine the metabolites theophylline, theobromine and paraxanthine were
 detectable. However these concentrations in plasma were mainly below limit of
 quantification.
 Afterwards the results were integrated into a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
 approach of TOUTAIN and LASSOURD (2002) to calculate the irrelevant plasma
 and urine concentrations where caffeine has no effect on the organism
 anymore. The calculation of the effective plasma concentration, the irrelevant
 plasma concentration and irrelevant urine concentration with the
 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model of TOUAIN and LASSOURD (2002) showed
 that the irrelevant plasma concentration (at 10.8 ng/ml) and urine
 concentration (at 4.5 ng/ml) at a dosing interval of 13 hours are far below
 the limit of detection. Therefore it is concluded that any detection of
 caffeine in plasma or urine has to be considered as a positive result of
 doping.
 In the second part of the pharmacokinetic experiment caffeine was administered
 at a single oral dose of 4 mg/kg body weight to six horses. The
 bioavailability was 56.9 %. The maximum concentrations of caffeine in plasma
 ranged between 2331 and 4118 ng/ml. The maximum concentrations of caffeine in
 urine ranged between 2373 and 7950 ng/ml. 120 hours after administration the
 concentrations in plasma and urine of all six horses were below limit of
 detection. In plasma and urine the metabolites theophylline, theobromine and
 paraxanthine were detectable. As well as in the first study these plasmaconcentrations
 were mainly below limit of quantification.
 In the third part of the pharmacokinetic experiment theobromine was
 administered at a single oral dose of 4 mg/kg body weight to six horses. The
 maximum concentrations of theobromine in plasma ranged between 1442 and 5177
 ng/ml. The maximum concentrations of theobromine in urine ranged between
 40211 and 88140 ng/ml. 168 hours after administration the concentrations in
 plasma of all six horses were below limit of detection. After 144 hours the
 concentrations in urine have fallen below limit of detection. No metabolites
 could be detected in plasma and urine. Using pattern of the metabolites the parent substance can be concluded. If
 there is almost sole theobromine in plasma or urine detectable, application
 of theobromine has been submitted.
 The considerable variance of calculations demonstrates the interindividual
 variability and the number of probands is too small to make a prediction
 about excretion times of caffeine and theobromine.
 The hypothesis to establish a selected cut-off value for
 therapeutics seems not to be acceptable for caffeine. Any detection of
 caffeine in plasma or urine samples should be considered as relevant for
 doping and should be punished appropriately.",2006,
Prescription medicine use by pedestrians and the risk of injurious road traffic crashes: A case-crossover study,"BACKGROUND
While some medicinal drugs have been found to affect driving ability, no study has investigated whether a relationship exists between these medicines and crashes involving pedestrians. The aim of this study was to explore the association between the use of medicinal drugs and the risk of being involved in a road traffic crash as a pedestrian.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
Data from 3 French nationwide databases were matched. We used the case-crossover design to control for time-invariant factors by using each case as its own control. To perform multivariable analysis and limit false-positive results, we implemented a bootstrap version of Lasso. To avoid the effect of unmeasured time-varying factors, we varied the length of the washout period from 30 to 119 days before the crash. The matching procedure led to the inclusion of 16,458 pedestrians involved in an injurious road traffic crash from 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2011. We found 48 medicine classes with a positive association with the risk of crash, with median odds ratios ranging from 1.12 to 2.98. Among these, benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-related drugs, antihistamines, and anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs were among the 10 medicines most consumed by the 16,458 pedestrians. Study limitations included slight overrepresentation of pedestrians injured in more severe crashes, lack of information about self-medication and the use of over-the-counter drugs, and lack of data on amount of walking.


CONCLUSIONS
Therapeutic classes already identified as impacting the ability to drive, such as benzodiazepines and antihistamines, are also associated with an increased risk of pedestrians being involved in a road traffic crash. This study on pedestrians highlights the necessity of improving awareness of the effect of these medicines on this category of road user.",2017,PLoS Medicine
Bi-alternating direction method of multipliers,"The alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been widely applied in the field of distributed optimization and statistic learning. ADMM iteratively approaches the saddle point of an augmented Lagrangian function by performing three updates per-iteration. In this paper, we propose a bi-alternating direction method of multipliers (BiADMM) that iteratively minimizes an augmented bi-conjugate function. As a result, the convergence of BiADMM is naturally established. Unlike ADMM that always involves three updates per iteration, BiADMM opens up an avenue to perform either two or three updates per iteration, depending on the functional construction. As an application, we consider applying BiADMM for the lasso problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method.",2013,"2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing"
"Dinosaur-plant interactions within a Middle Jurassic ecosystemâ€”palynology of the Burniston Bay dinosaur footprint locality, Yorkshire, UK","Dinosaur footprints are abundant in the Middle Jurassic Ravenscar Group of North Yorkshire, UK. Footprints are particularly common within the Bathonian Long Nab Member of the Scalby Formation and more so within the so-called â€˜Burniston footprint bedâ€™ at Burniston Bay. The Yorkshire Jurassic is also famous for its exceptional plant macrofossil and spore-pollen assemblages. Here we investigate the spore-pollen record from the dinosaur footprint-bearing successions in order to reconstruct the vegetation and assess possible dinosaur-plant interactions. We also compare the spore-pollen assemblages with the macroflora of the Scalby Ness Plant Bed, which occurs within the same geological member as the Burniston succession. The spore-pollen assemblages are dominated by Deltoidospora spp., the majority of which were probably produced by Coniopteris. Lycophyte spores (including megaspores) are common in the Yorkshire Jurassic, but lycophyte parent plants are extremely poorly represented in the macroflora. Seed ferns, represented by Alisporites spp., are moderately abundant. Conifer pollen assemblages are dominated by Araucariacites australis (probably produced by Brachyphyllum mamillare), Perinopollenites elatoides and Classopollis spp., with additional bisaccate pollen taxa. Abundant Ginkgo huttonii in the macroflora suggests that much of the monosulcate pollen was produced by ginkgoes. The diverse vegetation of the Cleveland Basin presumably represented an attractive food source for herbivorous dinosaurs. The dinosaurs probably gathered at the flood plains for fresh-water and also used the non-vegetated plains and coastline as pathways. Although assigning specific makers to footprints is difficult, it is clear that a range of theropod, ornithopod and sauropod dinosaurs inhabited the area.",2017,Palaeobiodiversity and Palaeoenvironments
Differentiation of glioblastoma from solitary brain metastases using radiomic machine-learning classifiers.,"This study aimed to identify the optimal radiomic machine-learning classifier for differentiating glioblastoma (GBM) from solitary brain metastases (MET) preoperatively. Four hundred and twelve patients with solitary brain tumors (242 GBM and 170 solitary brain MET) were divided into training (nâ€¯=â€¯227) and test (nâ€¯=â€¯185) cohorts. Radiomic features extraction was performed with PyRadiomics software. In the training cohort, twelve feature selection methods and seven classification methods were evaluated to construct favorable radiomic machine-learning classifiers. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using the mean area under the curve (AUC) and relative standard deviation in percentile (RSD). In the training cohort, thirteen classifiers had favorable predictive performances (AUCâ‰¥0.95 and RSD â‰¤6). In the test cohort, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that support vector machines (SVM)Â +Â least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (AUC, 0.90) classifiers had the highest prediction efficacy. Furthermore, the clinical performance of the best classifier was superior to neuroradiologists in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. In conclusion, employing radiomic machine-learning technology could help neuroradiologist in differentiating GBM from solitary brain MET preoperatively.",2019,Cancer letters

Statistical Guarantee for Non-Convex Optimization,"The aim of this thesis is to systematically study the statistical guarantee for two
representative non-convex optimization problems arsing in the statistics community.
The first one is the high-dimensional Gaussian mixture model, which is motivated by
the estimation of multiple graphical models arising from heterogeneous observations.
The second one is the low-rank tensor estimation model, which is motivated by
high-dimensional interaction model. Both optimal statistical rates and numerical
comparisons are studied in depth.
In the first part of my thesis, we consider joint estimation of multiple graphical
models arising from heterogeneous and high-dimensional observations. Unlike most
previous approaches which assume that the cluster structure is given in advance, an
appealing feature of our method is to learn cluster structure while estimating heterogeneous graphical models. This is achieved via a high dimensional version of Expectation
Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm. A joint graphical lasso penalty is
imposed on the conditional maximization step to extract both homogeneity and heterogeneity components across all clusters. Our algorithm is computationally efficient
due to fast sparse learning routines and can be implemented without unsupervised
learning knowledge. The superior performance of our method is demonstrated by extensive experiments and its application to a Glioblastoma cancer dataset reveals some
new insights in understanding the Glioblastoma cancer. In theory, a non-asymptotic
error bound is established for the output directly from our high dimensional ECM
algorithm, and it consists of two quantities: statistical error (statistical accuracy) and optimization error (computational complexity). Such a result gives a theoretical
guideline in terminating our ECM iterations.
In the second part of my thesis, we propose a general framework for sparse and low-rank tensor estimation from cubic sketchings. A two-stage non-convex implementation
is developed based on sparse tensor decomposition and thresholded gradient descent,
which ensures exact recovery in the noiseless case and stable recovery in the noisy
case with high probability. The non-asymptotic analysis sheds light on an interplay
between optimization error and statistical error. The proposed procedure is shown to
be rate-optimal under certain conditions. As a technical by-product, novel high-order
concentration inequalities are derived for studying high-moment sub-Gaussian tensors.
An interesting tensor formulation illustrates the potential application to high-order
interaction pursuit in high-dimensional linear regression",2019,
"Microflora from sauropod coprolites and associated sediments of Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Lameta Formation of Nand-Dongargaon basin, Maharashtra","Micofloral study of Lameta sediments and associated sauropod coprolites in the Nand-Dongargaon basin in Maharashtra was conducted to understand the diet and habitat of sauropods. The study revealed the presence of pollen, spores, algal and fungal remains, well-preserved cuticles of Poaceae, and testate amoebae. Vegetation during Lameta included tall arboreal taxa, such as conifers (Podocarpus and Araucaria), Cycads (Cycas), Euphorian and Barringtonia and herbs and shrubs, such as Cheirolepidiaceae (Classopollis), Arecaceae (Palmaepollenites), Poaceae (Graminidites), Asteraceae (Compositoipollenites), Caryophyllaceae (Cretacaeiporites and Periporopollenites), and Acanthaceae (Multiareolites). Data suggest that the sauropods ate soft tissues of angiosperms and gymnosperms. The intake of testate amoeba, algal remains, sponge spicules, and diatoms might be through water intake.",2017,Journal of the Geological Society of India
"Toward Data-driven, Semi-automatic Inference of Phenomenological Physical Models: Application to Eastern Sahel Rainfall","First-principles based predictive understanding of complex, dynamic physical phenomena, such as regional precipitation or hurricane intensity and frequency, is quite limited due to the lack of complete phenomenological models underlying their physics. To address this gap, hypothesis-driven, manually-constructed, conceptual hurricane models and models for regional-scale precipitation extremes have been emerging. To complement both approaches, we propose a methodology for data-driven, semi-automatic inference of plausible phenomenological models and apply it to derive the model for eastern Sahel rainfall, an important factor for socioeconomic growth and development of this region. At its core, our methodology derives cause-effect relationships using the Lasso multivariate regression model and quantifies compound affect that the complex interplay among the key predictors at their prominent temporal phases plays on the response (rainfall). Specifically, we propose methods for (a) detecting and ranking predictorsâ€™ prominent temporal phases, (b) optimizing the regularization penalty, (c) assessing predictor statistical significance, (d) performing impact analysis of data normalization on model inference, and (e) calculating the Expected Causality Impact (ECI) score to quantify impact analysis. The culmination of this study is the plausible phenomenological model of the eastern Sahel seasonal rainfall and quantified key climate drivers involved in the rainfall variability at different time lags. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first phenomenological model of this phenomenon; several of its components are consistent with the known evidence from literature.",2012,
Pivotal Estimation of Nonparametric Functions via Square-root Lasso,"In a nonparametric linear regression model we study a variant of LASSO, called p LASSO, which does not require the knowledge of the scaling parameter Ïƒ of the noise or bounds for it. This work derives new finite sample upper bounds for prediction norm rate of convergence, l1-rate of converge, lâˆž-rate of convergence, and sparsity of the p LASSO estimator. A lower bound for the prediction norm rate of convergence is also established. In many non-Gaussian noise cases, we rely on moderate deviation theory for self- normalized sums and on new data-dependent empirical process inequalities to achieve Gaussian-like results provided log p = o(n 1/3 ) improving upon results derived in the para- metric case that required log p . log n. In addition, we derive finite sample bounds on the performance of ordinary least square (OLS) applied tom the model selected by p LASSO accounting for possible misspecification of the selected model. In particular, we provide mild conditions under which the rate of convergence of OLS post p LASSO is not worse than p LASSO. We also study two extreme cases: parametric noiseless and nonparametric unbounded variance. p LASSO does have interesting theoretical guarantees for these two extreme cases. For the parametric noiseless case, differently than LASSO, p LASSO is capable of exact recovery. In the unbounded variance case it can still be consistent since its penalty choice does not depend on Ïƒ. Finally, we conduct Monte carlo experiments which show that the empirical performance of p LASSO is very similar to the performance of LASSO when Ïƒ is known. We also emphasize that p LASSO can be formulated as a convex programming problem and its computation burden is similar to LASSO. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence",2011,
"Interactions between Representation Theory , Quantum Field Theory , Category Theory and Quantum Information Theory Abstracts Representing Physical Systems as Chu Spaces","Representing Physical Systems as Chu Spaces Samson Abramsky Oxford University Computing Laboratory We pursue a model-oriented rather than axiomatic approach to the foundations of Quantum Mechanics, with the idea that new models can often suggest new axioms. This approach has often been fruitful in Logic and Theoretical Computer Science. Rather than seeking to construct a simplified toy model, we aim for a `big toy model', in which both quantum and classical systems can be faithfully represented --as well as, possibly, more exotic kinds of systems. To this end, we show how Chu spaces can be used to represent physical systems of various kinds. In particular, we show how quantum systems can be represented as Chu spaces over the unit interval in such a way that the Chu morphisms correspond exactly to the physically meaningful symmetries of the systems --the unitaries and antiunitaries. In this way we obtain a full and faithful functor from the groupoid of Hilbert spaces and their symmetries to Chu spaces. We also consider whether it is possible to use a finite value set rather than the unit interval; we show that two values do not suffice, but three do. We also show a connection between Chu spaces and coalgebras, and make some comparisons between the two frameworks. A Possible Approach to Inclusion of Space and Time in Frame Fields of Quantum Representations of Real and Complex Numbers Paul Benioff Argonne National Laboratory Earlier work on frame fields based on quantum representations of real and complex numbers is expanded to include space and time lattices in each frame in the field. This enables the inclusion of representations of physical systems in each frame. Special emphasis is placed on qukit strings as both mathematical and physical systems (hybrid systems). As physical systems they have a dynamics describable in each frame. As mathematical systems they represent rational numbers. The contents of each frame as seen from a parent frame is considered in some detail. One interesting result is that each point of a D dimensional lattice is a D tuple of hybrid systems in a parent frame with the point location given by the rational number states of the D tuple. It follows that the point locations of the parent frame view of a lattice have energies that are given by the Hamiltonian of the D tuple of hybrid systems. Adaptive Coherence Conditioning Robert J. Bonneau Air Force Office of Scientific Research Many applications in sensing and pattern recognition involve situations where the size of the vector space required to detect and identify a target is unknown a-priori. Examples of this situation occur in sensing applications where the noise subspace is unknown or in pattern recognition where the sample support of the space is not known to distinguish one object from another. We propose a method whereby the measurement vector space can be adaptively resized depending the on the Bayesian risk of the estimators involved. We will first develop a Lagrange minimization strategy which parallels some recent Lasso techniques of trading coherence for Bayesian risk in selecting the size of the vector space necessary for a given detection problem. We then develop the adaptive coherence updating strategy based on a Newton gradient approach to assess the Bayesian risk at each stage of a detection problem and then update the coherence based on the steepest gradient decent until the permitted risk level is met. We will then show risk bounds for statistical distributions as a function of coherence, show the correspondence in performance to different statistical estimators, and show the impact of the technique in performance of detecting targets in simulated tomographic imagery. Quantum Computational Curvature and Jacobi Fields Howard E. Brandt U.S. Army Research Laboratory Recent developments in the differential geometry of quantum computation are exposited. In the Riemannian geometry of quantum computation [1]-[4], the quantum evolution is described in terms of the special unitary group of n-qubit unitary operators with unit determinant. The group manifold is taken to be Riemannian. To elaborate on several aspects of the methodology, the Riemannian curvature, Jacobi equation, and lifted Jacobi equation on the group manifold are reviewed. Conjugate points and the so-called geodesic derivative are also addressed. This is important for investigations of the global characteristics of geodesic paths in the group manifold, and the determination of optimal quantum circuits for carrying out a quantum computation. Several significant issues of the methodology are emphasized. [1] M. R. Dowling and M. A. Nielsen, â€œThe Geometry of Quantum Computation,â€ Quantum Information and Computation 8, 0861-0899 (2008).

Perturbative expansions based on the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation Sergey Bravyi IBM It is widely believed that perturbative series for quantum field theory and many-body physics do not converge but are to be viewed as asymptotic series, meaning that their lowest-order terms provide a good approximation to the quantity of interest while inclusion of higher-order terms may actually give a worse result. We provide a quantitative version of this conjecture which can be rigorously proved for a large class of quantum spin models in which the unperturbed (free) Hamiltonian describes noninteracting spins (qudits) while the perturbation is a k-local Hamiltonian. Our proof relies on the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation of many-body physics which allows one to derive an effective low-energy Hamiltonian preserving locality features of the original Hamiltonian. This is a joint work with D. DiVincenzo (IBM) and D. Loss (U. Basel) A Unified Treatment for the Universality of Quantum Gates for Various Quantum Computing Gates Goong Chen Texas A&M University Universal quantum gates of one or two qubits can be designed from various quantum computing devices such as cavity-QED, ion and atom traps, quantum dots, linear optics, SQUIDs, etc. The establishment of universality of such devices depends on their Hamiltonians, and the proofs vary accordingly because such Hamiltonians usually are not conjugate to each other. In this talk, we try to find Lie-algebraic approaches to establish a somehow unified connection between the different Hamiltonians in order to obtain the universality of two bit gates. We hope that, eventually, such a unified treatment could facilitate future quantum circuit design where several devices need to be used in a circuit. This work is a collaboration with V. Ramakrishna. Depicting non-locality Bob Coecke Oxford University Computing Laboratory The punch-line of this talk is to ""depict non-locality"", that is, to provide a pictorial presentation of the flow of information which, due to Bell/GHZ-type arguments, cannot be given a stochastic spatio-temporal causal explanation. We will show that in the case of qubits the performed computation is that of an AND-gate on the choices of measurements made by distant observers.

Manturov Moscow State University Both classical and virtual knots arise as formal Gauss diagrams modulo some abstract moves corresponding to Reidemeister moves. If we forget about both over/under crossings structure and writhe numbers, we get simplification of virtual knots and links: free knots and free links. Free knots and links are also called homotopy classes of Gauss words and phrases. Obviously, all the free knots corresponding to classical knots are unknot. However, many virtual knots survive after this simplification. We construct invariants of free knots and present their applications to minimality problems of virtual knots. We also investigate cobordisms of free knots. We define a new strong invariant of free knots which allows to detect free knots not cobordant to the trivial one.

Diversity and phylogenetic profiling of niche-specific Bacilli from extreme environments of India,"The diversity of culturable, aerobic and heterotrophic Bacillus and Bacillus-derived genera (BBDG) was investigated in various extreme environments (including thermal springs, cold deserts, mangroves, salt lakes, arid regions, salt pans and acidic soils) of India. Heat treatment followed by enrichment in different media led to a total of 893 bacterial isolates. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) using three restriction enzymes AluI, MspI and HaeIII led to the clustering of these isolates into 12â€“74 groups for the different sites at 75Â % similarity index, adding up to 559 groups. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing led to the identification of 392 bacilli, grouped in two families, Bacillaceae (89.03Â %) and Paenibacillaceae (10.97Â %), and included 13 different genera with 75 distinct species. It was found that among the thirteen genera, nine (Bacillus, Halobacillus, Lysinibacillus, Oceanobacillus, Pontibacillus, Salinibacillus, Sediminibacillus, Thalassobacillus and Virgibacillus) belonged to Bacillaceae and four (Ammoniphilus, Aneurinibacillus, Brevibacillus and Paenibacillus) belonged to Paenibacillaceae. Novel isolates tolerant to low and high pH and temperature, salt and low moisture were identified. The major outcome of the present investigation was the identification of niche-specific species and also the ubiquitous presence of selected species of BBDG, which illustrate the diversity and pervasive nature of BBDG in extreme environments.",2014,Annals of Microbiology
Variable selection and corporate bankruptcy forecasts,"We investigate the relative importance of various bankruptcy predictors commonly used in the existing literature by applying a variable selection technique, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), to a comprehensive bankruptcy database. Over the 1980â€“2009 period, LASSO admits the majority of Campbell et al. (2008) predictive variables into the bankruptcy forecast model. Interestingly, by contrast with recent studies, some financial ratios constructed from only accounting data also contain significant incremental information about future default risk, and their importance relative to that of market-based variables in bankruptcy forecasts increases with prediction horizons. Moreover, LASSO-selected variables have superior out-of-sample predictive power and outperform (1) those advocated by Campbell et al. (2008) and (2) the distance to default from Mertonâ€™s (1974) structural model.",2015,Journal of Banking and Finance

Evaluating bacterial community structures in oil collected from the sea surface and sediment in the northern Gulf of Mexico after the deepwater horizon oil spill,"Bacterial community structures were evaluated in oil samples using culture-independent pyrosequencing, including oil mousses collected on sea surface and salt marshes during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and oil deposited in sediments adjacent to the wellhead 1Â year after the spill. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that Erythrobacter, Rhodovulum, Stappia, and Thalassospira of Alphaproteobacteria were the prevailing groups in the oil mousses, which may relate to high temperatures and strong irradiance in surface Gulf waters. In the mousse collected from the leaves of Spartina alterniflora, Vibrio of Gammaproteobacteria represented 57% of the total operational taxonomic units, suggesting that this indigenous genus is particularly responsive to the oil contamination in salt marshes. The bacterial communities in oil-contaminated sediments were highly diversified. The relatively high abundance of the Methylococcus, Methylobacter, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Chlorofexi bacteria resembles those found in certain cold-seep sediments with gas hydrates. Bacterial communities in the overlying water of the oil-contaminated sediment were dominated by Ralstonia of Betaproteobacteria, which can degrade small aromatics, and Saccharophagus degradans of Gammaproteobacteria, a cellulose degrader, suggesting that overlying water was affected by the oil-contaminated sediments, possibly due to the dissolution of small aromatics and biosurfactants produced during biodegradation. Overall, these results provided key information needed to evaluate oil degradation in the region and develop future bioremediation strategies.",2013,MicrobiologyOpen
Collaborative targeted minimum loss inference from continuously indexed nuisance parameter estimators.,"Suppose that we wish to infer the value of a statistical parameter at a law from which we sample independent observations. Suppose that this parameter is smooth and that we can define two variation-independent, infinite-dimensional features of the law, its so called Q- and G-components (comp.), such that if we estimate them consistently at a fast enough product of rates, then we can build a confidence interval (CI) with a given asymptotic level based on a plain targeted minimum loss estimator (TMLE). The estimators of the Q- and G-comp. would typically be by products of machine learning algorithms. We focus on the case that the machine learning algorithm for the G-comp. is fine-tuned by a real-valued parameter h. Then, a plain TMLE with an h chosen by cross-validation would typically not lend itself to the construction of a CI, because the selection of h would trade-off its empirical bias with something akin to the empirical variance of the estimator of the G-comp. as opposed to that of the TMLE. A collaborative TMLE (C-TMLE) might, however, succeed in achieving the relevant trade-off. We construct a C-TMLE and show that, under high-level empirical processes conditions, and if there exists an oracle h that makes a bulky remainder term asymptotically Gaussian, then the C-TMLE is asymptotically Gaussian hence amenable to building a CI provided that its asymptotic variance can be estimated too. We illustrate the construction and main result with the inference of the average treatment effect, where the Q-comp. consists in a marginal law and a conditional expectation, and the G-comp. is a propensity score (a conditional probability). We also conduct a multi-faceted simulation study to investigate the empirical properties of the collaborative TMLE when the G-comp. is estimated by the LASSO. Here, h is the bound on the l1-norm of the candidate coefficients.",2018,arXiv: Methodology
Successful immediate cryorecanalization of a simultaneous high-grade tracheal and bronchial stenosis as rare manifestations of bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.,"Endobronchial tumor obstruction of central airways causes severe limitations for the patient. For these conditions, an effective and safe bronchoscopic treatment modality is required to ameliorate obstructive symptoms. Most physicians use mechanical debulking by the rigid scope, but neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, argon plasma coagulation, and cryorecanalization are alternative techniques. The use of the flexible cryoprobe for immediate ablation of endoluminal tumors in lung cancer has been described earlier. This case reports for the first time the successful cryorecanalization of a combined severe tracheal and bronchial stenosis owing to bronchialassociated lymphoid tissue (BALT) lymphoma.",2009,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery

Les Polyneuropathies Chez Les Patients InfectÃ©s Par Le Vih Ã€ L\'Ã¨re Des AntirÃ©troviraux Au Chu De Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso),"Les polyneuropathies (PN) figurent parmi les complications neurologiques les plus frequentes au cours de l\'infection par le virus de l\'immunodeficience humaine (VIH). Elles peuvent etre en rapport avec le VIH lui-meme en raison de son neurotropisme propre ou etre la consequence de la neurotoxicite des antiretroviraux (ARV).

Objectifs 
Decrire les caracteristiques cliniques et evolutives des PN chez les patients infectes par le VIH en fonction de l\'administration ou non des ARV dans une cohorte de patients infectes par le VIH et suivis au CHU de Bobo-Dioulasso.

Methodologie 
Il s\'agit d\'une etude prospective de patients infectes par le VIH dont certains etaient traites par ARV, suivis pendant 12 mois en consultation externe de neurologie et ayant presente une PN. En l\'absence d\'electromyographie, le diagnostic de la neuropathie etait exclusivement clinique sur la base de la presence d\'un syndrome neurogene peripherique sensitivomoteur des membres inferieurs, avec diminution voire l\'abolition des reflexes osteotendineux et alteration de la pallesthesie des membres inferieurs.

Resultats 
Parmi les 537 patients infectes par le VIH, 239 etaient traites par les ARV. Les femmes representaient 70,2% de l\'echantillon. L\'Ã¢ge moyen etait de 40,2 ans (extremes: 20 a 69 ans) et la tranche d\'Ã¢ge de 30 a 49 ans constituait 65,9% de l\'effectif. 95,7% etaient infectes par le VIH1. Le nombre moyen de CD4 etait de 227,6/Î¼l et 62,2% avaient un nombre de CD4 inferieur a 200/Î¼l. La prevalence des PN chez les patients traites par les ARV etait plus importante que celle des PN de l\'ensemble de l\'echantillon (12,1% versus 8,4%). Chez les patients traites par les ARV, les PN survenaient dans un delai moyen de 4 mois apres l\'institution du traitement. Les PN sensitives representaient 87,2% de l\'echantillon.

Conclusion 
Deja frequentes au cours de l\'infection par le VIH, les PN risquent de voir leur prevalence s\'accroitre avec l\'utilisation plus frequente des ARV devenus maintenant plus accessibles au Burkina Faso
 HIV-associated polyneuropathies in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy in Bobo-Dioulasso Hospital (Burkina Faso).

Background 
Peripheral neuropathies represent the most common neurological manifestation in patients with HIV infection. Introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) had a significant impact on the epidemiology of HIV-associated polyneuropathies in developed countries. Objectives: We carried out this study to examine distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSP) in HIV-infected patients, to determine whether clinical manifestations are affected by HAART in a cohort of HIV-infected patients in Bobo-Dioulasso Hospital (Burkina Faso).

Methods 
HIV-infected patients were followed up over a 12-month period. DSP was clinically diagnosed based on amyotrophy and weakness, abnormalities of ankle reflexes or vibratory perception and if patients described pain, paresthesia or numbness in the limbs. Electromyography was not performed in this study.

Results 
Of 537 HIV-infected patients, 239 were treated by HAART. Among them, 94 patients (66 females and 28 males) with 40.2 of mean age were screened for DSP. Patients between 30-49 years represented 65.9% of the sample. 95.7% of 94 patients were HIV1-infected and 85.1% were treated by HAART while 14.9% were not. Prevalence of DSP among patients with HAART was higher 12.1% versus 8.4% among the whole sample. Among the whole sample, average CD4 cell count was 227.6/Î¼l. 62.2% of the patients had less than 200 cell counts at the time of diagnosis. Among patients with HAART, DSP occurred within 4 months after exposure to the antiretroviral agent. Sensitive polyneuropathies represented 87.2% of the sample. The occurrence of polyneuropathy was more correlated with decreased CD4 cells counts and neurotoxic antiretroviral therapy.

Conclusion 
Introduction of HAART has modified the course and the prognosis of HIV infection. The incidence of toxic polyneuropathies is increasing with longer patient life expectancy and represents a major factor in treatment limitation in HIV-infected patients even in poor resources settings.

Distribution and abundance of the antarctic petrel,"-Published and unpublished information on the distribution and abundance of the Antarctic Petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) is reviewed. Currently 35 colonies with approximately half a million breeding pairs are known. All but one of these known colonies are situated in East Antarctica. However, an estimate derived from at sea studies in three of four apparent centers of oceanic occurrence suggests a population as high as four to seven million breeding pairs (10 to 20 million individuals). In spite of the tentative nature of such an estimate, the difference with the colony-derived figure strongly suggests the existence of large, currently undiscovered colonies, particularly in western Antarctica and Victoria Land, where a complete mismatch exists between bird observations at sea and known colonies. In eastern Antarctica, in addition to undiscovered colonies, some known ones could be considerably larger than currently documented. Received 16June 1998, accepted 15 December 1998.",1999,Waterbirds

Prevalence and risk of HIV infection among female sex workers in Burkina Faso,"Summary: Little information is available regarding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among female sex workers (FSW) in Burkina Faso, West Africa. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, the 2 largest cities of the country, to determine the prevalence of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among FSWs, and to investigate the factors which were associated with HIV infection in this population. From October to November 1994, 426 FSWs were recruited. The method of anonymous and unlinked HIV screening recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) was used. The overall HIV seroprevalence was 58.2% (95% confidence interval: 53.4-62.9) and 52.6% of FSWs had at least one STD agent. The most common STDs were trichomoniasis (23%), syphilis (15%) and gonorrhoea (13%). In a logistic regression analysis, risk factors for HIV infection were high gravidity ( 2 pregnancies), low perception of personal risk of HIV infection, syphilis and the presence of genital warts. These results suggest that FSWs in Burkina Faso need better information about HIV transmission and prevention and then need better access to STD detection and management services.",1998,International Journal of STD and AIDS
Channel estimation and precoder design for millimeter-wave communications: The sparse way,"We propose strategies for mmWave communications that exploit the inherent sparsity of mmWave channels in the angle and delay domains. In particular, we propose the use of aperture shaping to ensure a sparse virtual-domain MIMO channel representation; fast FFT-based modulation and demodulation schemes to expose the virtual-channel coefficients; a pilot design that facilitates fast LASSO-based sparse-channel estimation; and spectrally efficient precoding and decoding, via the Lanczos algorithm and waterfilling over both frequency and angle. Numerical experiments suggest that our approach comes close to achieving the perfect-CSI capacity of the mmWave channel.",2014,"2014 48th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers"
The influence of endplate (Modic) changes on clinical outcomes in lumbar spinal stenosis surgery: a Swiss prospective multicenter cohort study,"To investigate if the presence or absence of preoperative endplate Modic changes (MC) is predictive for clinical outcomes in degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS) patients undergoing decompression-alone or decompression with instrumented fusion surgery. Two hundred five patients were included and categorized into four groups; 102 patients into the decompression-alone group with MCs, 41 patients into the fusion group with MCs, 46 patients into the decompression-alone group without MCs, and 16 patients into the fusion group without MCs. Clinical outcome was quantified with changes in spinal stenosis measure (SSM) symptoms, SSM function, NRS pain, and EQ-5D-3L sum score over time (measured at baseline, 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up) and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in SSM symptoms, SSM function, and NRS pain from baseline to 36-month follow-up. To investigate if possible effects of MCs had been modified or hidden by confounding variables, we used the group LASSO method to search for good prognostic models. There were no obvious differences in any of the clinical outcome measures between groups at baseline. At 12 months, most patients have improved in all outcomes and maintained improved conditions over time (no significant group differences). Between 70 and 90 percent of the patients maintained a clinically important improvement up to 36 months. Endplate MCs have no significant influence on clinical outcome parameters in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis compared to patients without MCs, independent of the chosen surgical strategy. All patients benefitted from surgical therapy up to 36-month follow-up. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.",2020,European Spine Journal

Modular Proximal Optimization for Multidimensional Total-Variation Regularization,"We study \emph{TV regularization}, a widely used technique for eliciting structured sparsity. In particular, we propose efficient algorithms for computing prox-operators for $\ell_p$-norm TV. The most important among these is $\ell_1$-norm TV, for whose prox-operator we present a new geometric analysis which unveils a hitherto unknown connection to taut-string methods. This connection turns out to be remarkably useful as it shows how our geometry guided implementation results in efficient weighted and unweighted 1D-TV solvers, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our 1D-TV solvers provide the backbone for building more complex (two or higher-dimensional) TV solvers within a modular proximal optimization approach. We review the literature for an array of methods exploiting this strategy, and illustrate the benefits of our modular design through extensive suite of experiments on (i) image denoising, (ii) image deconvolution, (iii) four variants of fused-lasso, and (iv) video denoising. To underscore our claims and permit easy reproducibility, we provide all the reviewed and our new TV solvers in an easy to use multi-threaded C++, Matlab and Python library.",2018,J. Mach. Learn.

Constrained maximum entropy models to select genotype interactions associated with censored failure times,"We propose a novel screening method targeting genotype interactions associated with disease risks. The proposed method extends the maximum entropy conditional probability model to address disease occurrences over time. Continuous occurrence times are grouped into intervals. The model estimates the conditional distribution over the disease occurrence intervals given individual genotypes by maximizing the corresponding entropy subject to constraints linking genotype interactions to time intervals. The EM algorithm is employed to handle observations with uncertainty, for which the disease occurrence is censored. Stepwise greedy search is proposed to screen a large number of candidate constraints. The minimum description length is employed to select the optimal set of constraints. Extensive simulations show that five or so quantile-dependent intervals are sufficient to categorize disease outcomes into different risk groups. Performance depends on sample size, number of genotypes, and minor allele frequencies. The proposed method outperforms the likelihood ratio test, Lasso, and a previous maximum entropy method with only binary (disease occurrence, non-occurrence) outcomes. Finally, a GWAS study for type 1 diabetes patients is used to illustrate our method. Novel one-genotype and two-genotype interactions associated with neuropathy are identified.",2018,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology

Non-parametric Group Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for Sparse Learning with Multiple Kernels,"We consider regularized risk minimization in a large dictionary of Reproducing kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) over which the target function has a sparse representation. This setting, commonly referred to as Sparse Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL), may be viewed as the non-parametric extension of group sparsity in linear models. While the two dominant algorithmic strands of sparse learning, namely convex relaxations using l1 norm (e.g., Lasso) and greedy methods (e.g., OMP), have both been rigorously extended for group sparsity, the sparse MKL literature has so far mainly adopted the former with mild empirical success. In this paper, we close this gap by proposing a Group-OMP based framework for sparse MKL. Unlike l1-MKL, our approach decouples the sparsity regularizer (via a direct l0 constraint) from the smoothness regularizer (via RKHS norms), which leads to better empirical performance and a simpler optimization procedure that only requires a black-box single-kernel solver. The algorithmic development and empirical studies are complemented by theoretical analyses in terms of Rademacher generalization bounds and sparse recovery conditions analogous to those for OMP [27] and Group-OMP [16].",2011,
Nearly optimal sample size in hypothesis testing for high-dimensional regression,"We consider the problem of fitting the parameters of a high-dimensional linear regression model. In the regime where the number of parameters p is comparable to or exceeds the sample size n, a successful approach uses an â„“1-penalized least squares estimator, known as Lasso. Unfortunately, unlike for linear estimators (e.g. ordinary least squares), no well-established method exists to compute confidence intervals or p-values on the basis of the Lasso estimator. Very recently, a line of work [8], [7], [13] has addressed this problem by constructing a debiased version of the Lasso estimator. We propose a special debiasing method that is well suited for random designs with sparse inverse covariance. Our approach improves over the state of the art in that it yields nearly optimal average testing power if sample size n asymptotically dominates s0(logp)2, with s0 being the sparsity level (number of non-zero coefficients). Earlier work achieved similar performances only for much larger sample size, namely it requires n to asymptotically dominates (s0 log p)2. We evaluate our method on synthetic data, and compare it with earlier proposals.",2013,"2013 51st Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)"
Functional Principal Component Analysis and Randomized Sparse Clustering Algorithm for Medical Image Analysis,"Due to the advancement in sensor technology, the growing large medical image data have the ability to visualize the anatomical changes in biological tissues. As a consequence, the medical images have the potential to enhance the diagnosis of disease, the prediction of clinical outcomes and the characterization of disease progression. But in the meantime, the growing data dimensions pose great methodological and computational challenges for the representation and selection of features in image cluster analysis. To address these challenges, we first extend the functional principal component analysis (FPCA) from one dimension to two dimensions to fully capture the space variation of image the signals. The image signals contain a large number of redundant features which provide no additional information for clustering analysis. The widely used methods for removing the irrelevant features are sparse clustering algorithms using a lasso-type penalty to select the features. However, the accuracy of clustering using a lasso-type penalty depends on the selection of the penalty parameters and the threshold value. In practice, they are difficult to determine. Recently, randomized algorithms have received a great deal of attentions in big data analysis. This paper presents a randomized algorithm for accurate feature selection in image clustering analysis. The proposed method is applied to both the liver and kidney cancer histology image data from the TCGA database. The results demonstrate that the randomized feature selection method coupled with functional principal component analysis substantially outperforms the current sparse clustering algorithms in image cluster analysis.",2015,PLoS ONE
An Homotopy Algorithm for the Lasso with Online Observations,"It has been shown that the problem of l1-penalized least-square regression commonly referred to as the Lasso or Basis Pursuit DeNoising leads to solutions that are sparse and therefore achieves model selection. We propose in this paper RecLasso, an algorithm to solve the Lasso with online (sequential) observations. We introduce an optimization problem that allows us to compute an homotopy from the current solution to the solution after observing a new data point. We compare our method to Lars and Coordinate Descent, and present an application to compressive sensing with sequential observations. Our approach can easily be extended to compute an homotopy from the current solution to the solution that corresponds to removing a data point, which leads to an efficient algorithm for leave-one-out cross-validation. We also propose an algorithm to automatically update the regularization parameter after observing a new data point.",2008,
Challenges and caveats of a multi-center retrospective radiomics study: an example of early treatment response assessment for NSCLC patients using FDG-PET/CT radiomics,"BACKGROUND
Prognostic models based on individual patient characteristics can improve treatment decisions and outcome in the future. In many (radiomic) studies, small size and heterogeneity of datasets is a challenge that often limits performance and potential clinical applicability of these models. The current study is example of a retrospective multi-centric study with challenges and caveats. To highlight common issues and emphasize potential pitfalls, we aimed for an extensive analysis of these multi-center pre-treatment datasets, with an additional 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan acquired during treatment.


METHODS
The dataset consisted of 138 stage II-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from four different cohorts acquired from three different institutes. The differences between the cohorts were compared in terms of clinical characteristics and using the so-called 'cohort differences model' approach. Moreover, the potential prognostic performances for overall survival of radiomic features extracted from CT or FDG-PET, or relative or absolute differences between the scans at the two time points, were assessed using the LASSO regression method. Furthermore, the performances of five different classifiers were evaluated for all image sets.


RESULTS
The individual cohorts substantially differed in terms of patient characteristics. Moreover, the cohort differences model indicated statistically significant differences between the cohorts. Neither LASSO nor any of the tested classifiers resulted in a clinical relevant prognostic model that could be validated on the available datasets.


CONCLUSION
The results imply that the study might have been influenced by a limited sample size, heterogeneous patient characteristics, and inconsistent imaging parameters. No prognostic performance of FDG-PET or CT based radiomics models can be reported. This study highlights the necessity of extensive evaluations of cohorts and of validation datasets, especially in retrospective multi-centric datasets.",2019,PLoS ONE
Temporal signals classification,"Nowadays, there are a lot of applications related to machine vision and hearing which tried to reproduce human capabilities on machines. These problems are mainly amenable to a temporal signals classification problem, due our interest to this subject. In fact, we were interested to two distinct problems, humain gait recognition and audio signal recognition including both environmental and music ones. In the former, we have proposed a novel method to automatically learn and select the dynamic human body-parts to tackle the problem intra-class variations contrary to state-of-art methods which relied on predefined knowledge. To achieve it a group fused lasso algorithm is applied to segment the human body into parts with coherent motion value across the subjects. In the latter, while no conventional feature representation showed its ability to tackle both environmental and music problems, we propose to model audio classification as a supervised dictionary learning problem. This is done by learning a dictionary per class and encouraging the dissimilarity between the dictionaries by penalizing their pair- wise similarities. In addition the coefficients of a signal representation over these dictionaries is sought as sparse as possible. The experimental evaluations provide performing and encouraging results.",2017,
Asymptotic Risk of Bezier Simplex Fitting,"The Bezier simplex fitting is a novel data modeling technique which exploits geometric structures of data to approximate the Pareto front of multi-objective optimization problems. There are two fitting methods based on different sampling strategies. The inductive skeleton fitting employs a stratified subsampling from each skeleton of a simplex, whereas the all-at-once fitting uses a non-stratified sampling which treats a simplex as a whole. In this paper, we analyze the asymptotic risks of those B\'ezier simplex fitting methods and derive the optimal subsample ratio for the inductive skeleton fitting. It is shown that the inductive skeleton fitting with the optimal ratio has a smaller risk when the degree of a Bezier simplex is less than three. Those results are verified numerically under small to moderate sample sizes. In addition, we provide two complementary applications of our theory: a generalized location problem and a multi-objective hyper-parameter tuning of the group lasso. The former can be represented by a Bezier simplex of degree two where the inductive skeleton fitting outperforms. The latter can be represented by a Bezier simplex of degree three where the all-at-once fitting gets an advantage.",2019,ArXiv

The objective of this study was to characterize regions that have an impact on a runs of homozygosity (ROH) metric and estimate their association with the additive genetic effect of milk (MY), fat (FY) and protein yield (PY) and calving interval (CI) using Australia (AU) and United States (US) Jersey cows.MethodsGenotyped cows with phenotypes on MY, FY and PY (nâ€‰=â€‰6751 US; nâ€‰=â€‰3974 AU) and CI (nâ€‰=â€‰5816 US; nâ€‰=â€‰3905 AU) were used in a two-stage analysis. A ROH statistic (ROH4Mb), which counts the frequency of a SNP being in a ROH of at least 4 Mb was calculated across the genome. In the first stage, residuals were obtained from a model that accounted for the portion explained by the estimated breeding value. In the second stage, these residuals were regressed on ROH4Mb using a single marker regression model and a gradient boosted machine (GBM) algorithm. The relationship between the additive and ROH4Mb of a region was characterized based on the (co)variance of 500 kb estimated genomic breeding values derived from a Bayesian LASSO analysis. Phenotypes to determine ROH4Mb and additive effects were residuals from the two-stage approach and yield deviations, respectively.ResultsAssociations between yield traits and ROH4Mb were found for regions on BTA13, BTA23 and BTA25 for the US population and BTA3, BTA7, BTA17 for the AU population. Only one association (BTA7) was found for CI and ROH4Mb for the US population. Multiple potential epistatic interactions were characterized based on the GBM analysis. Lastly, the covariance sign between ROH4Mb and additive SNP effect of a region was heterogeneous across the genome.ConclusionWe identified multiple genomic regions associated with ROH4Mb in US and AU Jersey females. The covariance of regions impacting ROH4Mb and the additive genetic effect were positive and negative, which provides evidence that the homozygosity effect is location dependent.",2015,BMC Genomics
Composition and content of selected elements of Croatian blackberry wines,"The blackberry wine is recognised as a natural source of many bioactive molecules and essential elements that play an important role in health promotion and disease prevention. The wine is traditionally popular medicine for anemia and iron deficiency. The aim of this work was to evaluate quality physical and chemical characteristics and concentration of macro elements Ca, K, Mg, Na, essential elements Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, soil associated elements Li, Rb, Sr and toxic elements Al, Co, Pb of selected 22 blackberry wines from different regions of Croatia. Basic quality characteristics of all fruit wines were determined as follows: alcoholic strength (% vol), total sugars (g L -1 ), total extract (g L -1 ), ash (g L -1 ), pH, total acidity (g L -1 , malic acid) and volatile acidity (g L -1 , acetic acid). The results indicate that blackberry wines represent high quality beverage. For determination of elements, fast and precise method of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used. Following elements were detected in investigated blackberry wines in different amounts: macro elements Ca, K, Mg, Na (mg L -1 ), essential elements Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn (mg L -1 ), soilassociated elements Li, Rb, Sr (Âµg L -1 ) and toxic elements Al, Co and Pb (Âµg L -1 ). It can be concluded that moderate consumption of blackberry wines may contribute to daily dietary intake of essential elements and wines can be considered as health safe, because potentially toxic elements are kept under allowable limits.",2014,Journal of Food Agriculture & Environment
Shrinkage Estimation of Factor Models With Global and Group-Specific Factors,"AbstractThis article develops an adaptive group lasso estimator for factor models with both global and group-specific factors. The global factors can affect all variables, whereas the group-specific factors are only allowed to affect the variables within a certain group. We propose a new method to separately identify the spaces spanned by global and group-specific factors, and we develop a new shrinkage estimator that can consistently estimate the factor loadings and determine the number of factors simultaneously. The asymptotic result shows that the proposed estimator can select the true model specification with a probability approaching one. An information criterion is developed to select the optimal tuning parameters in the shrinkage estimation. Monte Carlo simulations confirm our asymptotic theory, and the proposed estimator performs well in finite samples. In an empirical application, we implement the proposed method to a dataset consisting of Eurozone, United States, and United Kingdom macroeconomic...",2016,Journal of Business & Economic Statistics
Dynamic Structural Equation Models for Tracking Cascades Over Social Networks,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used for dimensionality reduction, with well-documented merits in various applications involving high-dimensional data, including computer vision, preference measurement, and bioinformatics. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from variable selection and compressive sampling, to robustify PCA against outliers. A least-trimmed squares estimator of a low-rank bilinear factor analysis model is shown closely related to that obtained from an -(pseudo)norm-regularized criterion encouraging sparsity in a matrix explicitly modeling the outliers. This connection suggests robust PCA schemes based on convex relaxation, which lead naturally to a family of robust estimators encompassing Huberâ€™s optimal M-class as a special case. Outliers are identified by tuning a regularization parameter, which amounts to controlling sparsity of the outlier matrix along the whole robustification path of (group) least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) solutions. Beyond its ties to robust statistics, the developed outlier-aware PCA framework is versatile to accommodate novel and scalable algorithms to: i) track the low-rank signal subspace robustly, as new data are acquired in real time; and ii) determine principal components robustly in (possibly) infinite-dimensional feature spaces. Synthetic and real data tests corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed robust PCA schemes, when used to identify aberrant responses in personality assessment surveys, as well as unveil communities in social networks, and intruders from video surveillance data.",2013,

Four transcription profileâ€“based models identify novel prognostic signatures in oesophageal cancer,"Oesophageal cancer (ESCA) is a clinically challenging disease with poor prognosis and health-related quality of life. Here, we investigated the transcriptome of ESCA to identify high risk-related signatures. A total of 159 ESCA patients of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were sorted by three phases. In the discovery phase, differentially expressed transcripts were filtered; in the training phase, two adjusted Cox regressions and two machine leaning models were used to construct and estimate signatures; and in the validation phase, prognostic signatures were validated in the testing dataset and the independent external cohort. We constructed two signatures from three types of RNA markers by Akaike information criterion (AIC) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regressions, respectively, and all candidate markers were further estimated by Random Forest (RFS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Both signatures had good predictive performances in the independent external oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cohort and performed better than common clinicopathological indicators in the TCGA dataset. Machine learning algorithms predicted prognosis with high specificities and measured the importance of markers to verify the risk weightings. Furthermore, the cell function and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining assays identified that the common risky marker FABP3 is a novel oncogene in ESCA.",2019,Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine
Efficient in vivo synthesis of lasso peptide pseudomycoidin proceeds in the absence of both the leader and the leader peptidaseâ€  â€ Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Supplementary Fig. S1â€“S14 and experimental procedures. See DOI: 10.1039/c9sc02370d,"Bacterial lasso peptides are made from linear ribosomally synthesized precursors by specific cleavage at the leader-core junction site of the precursor by a dedicated protease recognizing the leader, followed by cyclisation of the newly formed N-terminus of the core part with a side chain of the internal aspartic or glutamic residue catalyzed by a macrolactam synthetase. The resulting structure has a tail that is threaded and fixed inside the cycle formed. Here, we characterize a new lasso peptide, pseudomycoidin, encoded by Bacillus pseudomycoides DSM 12442. The most surprising and unique feature of pseudomycoidin is that it can be produced in vivo from the ribosomally synthesized core part by a macrolactam synthetase, in the absence of the leader protease. The minimalism of the pseudomycoidin synthesis system makes it a powerful model to generate pseudomycoidin-based lasso-peptide libraries and to study the poorly understood process of lasso formation. We detected two additional pseudomycoidin modifications: phosphorylation of a terminal residue that was previously observed in another lasso peptide, followed by glycosylation, which was not observed heretofore. We speculate that these bulky C-terminal modifications may help maintain the threaded lasso topology of the compound synthesized by the macrolactam synthetase.",2019,Chemical Science
cDREM: Inferring Dynamic Combinatorial Gene Regulation,"Genes are often combinatorially regulated by multiple transcription factors (TFs). Such combinatorial regulation plays an important role in development and facilitates the ability of cells to respond to different stresses. While a number of approaches have utilized sequence and ChIP-based datasets to study combinational regulation, these have often ignored the combinational logic and the dynamics associated with such regulation. Here we present cDREM, a new method for reconstructing dynamic models of combinatorial regulation. cDREM integrates time series gene expression data with (static) protein interaction data. The method is based on a hidden Markov model and utilizes the sparse group Lasso to identify small subsets of combinatorially active TFs, their time of activation, and the logical function they implement. We tested cDREM on yeast and human data sets. Using yeast we show that the predicted combinatorial sets agree with other high throughput genomic datasets and improve upon prior methods developed to infer combinatorial regulation. Applying cDREM to study human response to flu, we were able to identify several combinatorial TF sets, some of which were known to regulate immune response while others represent novel combinations of important TFs.",2015,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology
The Need for Speed: Neuroendocrine Regulation of Socially-controlled Sex Change.,"Socially-controlled functional sex change in fishes is a dramatic example of adaptive reproductive plasticity. Functional gonadal sex change can occur within a week while behavioral sex change can begin within minutes. Significant progress has been made in understanding the neuroendocrine bases of this phenomenon at both the gonadal and the neurobiological levels, but a detailed mechanistic understanding remains elusive. We are working with sex-changing wrasses to identify evolutionarily-conserved neuroendocrine pathways underlying this reproductive adaptation. One key model is the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), in which sex change is well studied at the behavioral, ecological, and neuroendocrine levels. Bluehead wrasses show rapid increases in aggressive and courtship behaviors with sex change that do not depend on the presence of gonads. The display of male-typical behavior is correlated with the expression of arginine vasotocin, and experiments support a role for this neuropeptide. Estrogen synthesis is also critical in the process. Female bluehead wrasses have higher abundance of aromatase mRNA in the brain and gonads, and estrogen implants block behavioral sex change. While established methods have advanced our understanding of sex change, a full understanding will require new approaches and perspectives. First, contributions of other neuroendocrine systems should be better characterized, particularly glucocorticoid and thyroid signaling. Second, advances in genomics for non-traditional model species should allow conserved mechanisms to be identified with a key next-step being manipulative tests of these mechanisms. Finally, advances in genomics now also allow study of the role of epigenetic modifications and other regulatory mechanisms in the dramatic alterations across the sex-change process.",2015,Integrative and comparative biology
Variable Selection in Kernel Regression Using Measurement Error Selection Likelihoods.,"This paper develops a nonparametric shrinkage and selection estimator via the measurement error selection likelihood approach recently proposed by Stefanski, Wu, and White. The Measurement Error Kernel Regression Operator (MEKRO) has the same form as the Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator, but optimizes a measurement error model selection likelihood to estimate the kernel bandwidths. Much like LASSO or COSSO solution paths, MEKRO results in solution paths depending on a tuning parameter that controls shrinkage and selection via a bound on the harmonic mean of the pseudo-measurement error standard deviations. We use small-sample-corrected AIC to select the tuning parameter. Large-sample properties of MEKRO are studied and small-sample properties are explored via Monte Carlo experiments and applications to data.",2017,Journal of the American Statistical Association
Double machine learning for treatment and causal parameters,"Most modern supervised statistical/machine learning (ML) methods are explicitly designed to solve prediction problems very well. Achieving this goal does not imply that these methods automatically deliver good estimators of causal parameters. Examples of such parameters include individual regression coffiecients, average treatment e ffects, average lifts, and demand or supply elasticities. In fact, estimators of such causal parameters obtained via naively plugging ML estimators into estimating equations for such parameters can behave very poorly. For example, the resulting estimators may formally have inferior rates of convergence with respect to the sample size n caused by regularization bias. Fortunately, this regularization bias can be removed by solving auxiliary prediction problems via ML tools. Speci ficially, we can form an efficient score for the target low-dimensional parameter by combining auxiliary and main ML predictions. The efficient score may then be used to build an efficient estimator of the target parameter which typically will converge at the fastest possible 1/v n rate and be approximately unbiased and normal, allowing simple construction of valid con fidence intervals for parameters of interest. The resulting method thus could be called a ""double ML"" method because it relies on estimating primary and auxiliary predictive models. Such double ML estimators achieve the fastest rates of convergence and exhibit robust good behavior with respect to a broader class of probability distributions than naive ""single"" ML estimators. In order to avoid overfi tting, following [3], our construction also makes use of the K-fold sample splitting, which we call cross- fitting. The use of sample splitting allows us to use a very broad set of ML predictive methods in solving the auxiliary and main prediction problems, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, as well as various hybrids and aggregates of these methods (e.g. a hybrid of a random forest and lasso). We illustrate the application of the general theory through application to the leading cases of estimation and inference on the main parameter in a partially linear regression model and estimation and inference on average treatment eff ects and average treatment e ffects on the treated under conditional random assignment of the treatment. These applications cover randomized control trials as a special case. We then use the methods in an empirical application which estimates the e ffect of 401(k) eligibility on accumulated financial assets.",2016,arXiv: Machine Learning
Exploiting Genome Structure in Association Analysis,"A genome-wide association study involves examining a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify SNPs that are significantly associated with the given phenotype, while trying to reduce the false positive rate. Although haplotype-based association methods have been proposed to accommodate correlation information across nearby SNPs that are in linkage disequilibrium, none of these methods directly incorporated the structural information such as recombination events along chromosome. In this paper, we propose a new approach called stochastic block lasso for association mapping that exploits prior knowledge on linkage disequilibrium structure in the genome such as recombination rates and distances between adjacent SNPs in order to increase the power of detecting true associations while reducing false positives. Following a typical linear regression framework with the genotypes as inputs and the phenotype as output, our proposed method employs a sparsity-enforcing Laplacian prior for the regression coefficients, augmented by a first-order Markov process along the sequence of SNPs that incorporates the prior information on the linkage disequilibrium structure. The Markov-chain prior models the structural dependencies between a pair of adjacent SNPs, and allows us to look for association SNPs in a coupled manner, combining strength from multiple nearby SNPs. Our results on HapMap-simulated datasets and mouse datasets show that there is a significant advantage in incorporating the prior knowledge on linkage disequilibrium structure for marker identification under whole-genome association.",2014,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology
"New palynological data from the Ruivo-1 and Corvina wells, offshore Algarve Basin, Portugal - implications for future hydrocarbon exploration","The Algarve Basin is an important Mesozoic sedimentary basin located in southern Portugal. Its onshore part consists largely of marine carbonate sediments with more than 2000 m in thickness. The basin extends offshore where its geology is recognized seismically and a few hydrocarbon exploration wells were drilled in the mid 70â€™s and early 80â€™s. The palynostratigraphical study of two of these wells, Ruivo-1 and Corvina, has yielded new biostratigraphical data based on dinoflagellate cysts. The Ruivo-1 well has a total depth of 2100 m and drilled a thick Callovian succession between 1800 and 2030 m . The samples from this interval yielded abundant organic residues that comprise well-preserved palynomorphs together with plant fragments. T he dinoflagellate cysts assemblage include Batiacasphaera spp., Ctenidodinium sp., Ctenidodinium sellwoodii group, Ellipsoidictyum gochtii , Ellipsoidictyum/Valensiella group, Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. adecta , Impletosphaeridium spp., Korystocysta gochtii , Meiourogonyaulax caytonensis group, Pareodinia ceratophora , Sentusidinium spp., Systematophora areolata , Systematophora penicillata , Systematophora spp. and Tubotuberella dangeardii . This association is indicative of the Middle-Late Callovian. However, the presence in this interval of Nannoceratopsis deflandrei subsp. deflandrei , a Toarcian-Aalenian marker, suggesting reworking. The Corvina well cored a 2700 m thick succession of Miocene to Upper Jurassic sediments. S amples collected between 1595 and 2680 m yielded relatively abundant organic residues dominated by dinoflagellate cysts. The pollen associations are of low diversity and include bisaccate pollen, Callialasporites dampieri, Callialasporites turbatus, Callialasporites spp., Classopollis classoides and Perinopollenites elatoides . The dinoflagellate cyst floras from these samples are indicative of the ?Early-Middle Oxfordian due principally to the occurrence of Ctenidodinium ornatum , Compositosphaeridium polonicum , H ystrichosphaerina orbifera , Endoscrinium luridum , Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp . jurassica , Rigaudella aemula , Surculosphaeridium vestitum , Stephanelytron redcliffense , Systematophora spp. and Wanaea acollaris . The dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from the two wells are less diverse than typical Callovian-Oxfordian associations from further north in Europe. The results are also consistent with the onshore Algarve Basin and could be explained by the partially enclosed nature of the Algarve Basin during Jurassic times. This new biostratigraphical data will help to refine the time calibration of the available seismic lines and help in future hydrocarbon exploration work.",2011,
Fine-mapping additive and dominant SNP effects using group-LASSO and fractional resample model averaging.,"Genomewide association studies (GWAS) sometimes identify loci at which both the number and identities of the underlying causal variants are ambiguous. In such cases, statistical methods that model effects of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) simultaneously can help disentangle the observed patterns of association and provide information about how those SNPs could be prioritized for follow-up studies. Current multi-SNP methods, however, tend to assume that SNP effects are well captured by additive genetics; yet when genetic dominance is present, this assumption translates to reduced power and faulty prioritizations. We describe a statistical procedure for prioritizing SNPs at GWAS loci that efficiently models both additive and dominance effects. Our method, LLARRMA-dawg, combines a group LASSO procedure for sparse modeling of multiple SNP effects with a resampling procedure based on fractional observation weights. It estimates for each SNP the robustness of association with the phenotype both to sampling variation and to competing explanations from other SNPs. In producing an SNP prioritization that best identifies underlying true signals, we show the following: our method easily outperforms a single-marker analysis; when additive-only signals are present, our joint model for additive and dominance is equivalent to or only slightly less powerful than modeling additive-only effects; and when dominance signals are present, even in combination with substantial additive effects, our joint model is unequivocally more powerful than a model assuming additivity. We also describe how performance can be improved through calibrated randomized penalization, and discuss how dominance in ungenotyped SNPs can be incorporated through either heterozygote dosage or multiple imputation.",2015,Genetic epidemiology
The evolution of sex-change timing under environmental uncertainty: a test by simulation,"Background: Life-history theory predicts that selection for changing from an initial sex to a second sex exists when the size- or age-specific reproductive-rate curves for males and females cross. The optimal timing of sex change will be the size or age at which the curves cross. But wild populations of many sex-changing fishes do not follow this prediction; individuals generally change sex at a size or age at which the sex that they become cannot yet reproduce. This phenomenon is termed â€˜early sex changeâ€™. Question: Does uncertainty in the advent of successful reproduction in the second sex favour the evolution of early sex change? Method: Genetically explicit simulation to track the evolution of sex change timing. Key assumption: Reproduction in the initial sex (female) is assured but of low value, whereas reproduction in the second sex (male) is uncertain but of high value. Organisms: Our model is primarily based on the natural history of the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, but is designed to apply to many other species of sex-changing fishes. Results: Early sex change rapidly evolved under the conditions of the model. Moreover, the timing of sex change became highly variable within a population. The mean age of switching from female to male depended on the ratio of male to female reproductive rates: the higher the ratio, the earlier the mean age at which females switched. A second mechanism for early sex change arose from the asymmetrical fitness surface of females: those that switch earlier than the optimum time pay a smaller fitness penalty than those that switch later.",2011,Evolutionary Ecology Research
Development and Validation of an Algorithm to Identify Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in the Electronic Medical Record,"Background and AimsNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Risk factors for NAFLD disease progression and liver-related outcomes remain incompletely understood due to the lack of computational identification methods. The present study sought to design a classification algorithm for NAFLD within the electronic medical record (EMR) for the development of large-scale longitudinal cohorts.MethodsWe implemented feature selection using logistic regression with adaptive LASSO. A training set of 620 patients was randomly selected from the Research Patient Data Registry at Partners Healthcare. To assess a true diagnosis for NAFLD we performed chart reviews and considered either a documentation of a biopsy or a clinical diagnosis of NAFLD. We included in our model variables laboratory measurements, diagnosis codes, and concepts extracted from medical notes. Variables with PÂ <Â 0.05 were included in the multivariable analysis.ResultsThe NAFLD classification algorithm included number of natural language mentions of NAFLD in the EMR, lifetime number of ICD-9 codes for NAFLD, and triglyceride level. This classification algorithm was superior to an algorithm using ICD-9 data alone with AUC of 0.85 versus 0.75 (PÂ <Â 0.0001) and leads to the creation of a new independent cohort of 8458 individuals with a high probability for NAFLD.ConclusionsThe NAFLD classification algorithm is superior to ICD-9 billing data alone. This approach is simple to develop, deploy, and can be applied across different institutions to create EMR-based cohorts of individuals with NAFLD.",2015,Digestive Diseases and Sciences
Split Bregman algorithms for sparse group Lasso with application to MRI reconstruction,"Sparse group lasso, concerning with group-wise and within-group sparsity, is generally considered difficult to solve due to the mixed-norm structure.

These algorithms have low computational complexity and are suitable for large scale problems. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is also discussed. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are used for magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",2015,Multidimensional Systems and Signal Processing
Development of a Predictive Model of Difficult Hemostasis following Endobronchial Biopsy in Lung Cancer Patients,"Endobronchial biopsy (EBB)-induced bleeding is fairly common; however, it can be potentially life-threatening due to difficult hemostasis following EBB. The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model of difficult hemostasis post-EBB. A total of 620 consecutive patients with primary lung cancer who had undergone EBB between 2014 and 2018 in a large tertiary hospital were enrolled in this retrospective single-center cohort study. Patients were classified into the difficult hemostasis group and the nondifficult hemostasis group according to hemostatic measures used following EBB. The LASSO regression method was used to select predictors andmultivariate logistic regressionwas applied to develop the predictivemodel.The area under the curve (AUC) of the model was calculated. Bootstrapping method was applied for internal validation. Calibration curve analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) were also performed. A nomogram was constructed to display the model. The incidence of difficult hemostasis post-EBB was 11.9% (74/620). Eight variables were selected by the LASSO regression analysis and seven (histological type of cancer, lesion location, neutrophil percentage, activated partial thromboplastin time, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteinE, and pulmonary infection) of them were finally included in the predictive model. The AUC of the model was 0.822 (95% CI, 0.777-0.868), and it was 0.808 (95% CI, 0.761-0.856) in the internal validation. The predictive model was well calibrated and DCA indicated its potential clinical usefulness, which suggests that the model has great potential to predict lung cancer patients with a more difficult post-EBB hemostasis.",2019,
"Palynofacies analysis and sedimentary environment of Early Cretaceous sediments from Dixcove 4-2x well, Cape Three Points, offshore Tano Basin, western Ghana","Palynofacies analysis carried out on fifty eight (58) cutting samples from the Dixcove 4-2x well offshore Cape Three Points in the South Tano Basin, identified five palynofacies types (P-I to P-V). Palynofacies types P-I and P-IV suggest proximity to a fluvio â€“ deltaic source in a moderately dysoxic environment, P-II reflects a proximal (pro delta) dysoxic - suboxic environment, P-III is indicative of deposition in an oxidizing condition in proximity to terrestrial sources and P-V is attributed to deposition resulting from high preservation rate and low energy dysoxic- anoxic condition in marginal marine environment. An Aptian to Cenomanian age has been assigned to the interval studied based on known stratigraphically important palynomorphs. The presence of Afropollis jardinus , Classopollis spp, Ephedripites spp , Elaterspores and the pteridophytes Cicatricosisporites , Deltoidspora , Cyathidites etc) suggest a paleoenvironment with parent plants inhabiting wetlands in a humid, warm coastal plain in a semi-arid climate.

Ensemble Methods for MiRNA Target Prediction from Expression Data,"BACKGROUND
microRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs that are involved in several diseases, including cancers. Identifying miRNA functions is very important in understanding disease mechanisms and determining the efficacy of drugs. An increasing number of computational methods have been developed to explore miRNA functions by inferring the miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships from data. Each of the methods is developed based on some assumptions and constraints, for instance, assuming linear relationships between variables. For such reasons, computational methods are often subject to the problem of inconsistent performance across different datasets. On the other hand, ensemble methods integrate the results from individual methods and have been proved to outperform each of their individual component methods in theory.


RESULTS
In this paper, we investigate the performance of some ensemble methods over the commonly used miRNA target prediction methods. We apply eight different popular miRNA target prediction methods to three cancer datasets, and compare their performance with the ensemble methods which integrate the results from each combination of the individual methods. The validation results using experimentally confirmed databases show that the results of the ensemble methods complement those obtained by the individual methods and the ensemble methods perform better than the individual methods across different datasets. The ensemble method, Pearson+IDA+Lasso, which combines methods in different approaches, including a correlation method, a causal inference method, and a regression method, is the best performed ensemble method in this study. Further analysis of the results of this ensemble method shows that the ensemble method can obtain more targets which could not be found by any of the single methods, and the discovered targets are more statistically significant and functionally enriched. The source codes, datasets, miRNA target predictions by all methods, and the ground truth for validation are available in the Supplementary materials.",2015,PLoS ONE
Correcting for unknown errors in sparse high-dimensional function approximation,"We consider sparsity-based techniques for the approximation of high-dimensional functions from random pointwise evaluations. To date, almost all the works published in this field contain some a priori assumptions about the error corrupting the samples that are hard to verify in practice. In this paper, we instead focus on the scenario where the error is unknown. We study the performance of four sparsity-promoting optimization problems: weighted quadratically-constrained basis pursuit, weighted LASSO, weighted square-root LASSO, and weighted LAD-LASSO. From the theoretical perspective, we prove uniform recovery guarantees for these decoders, deriving recipes for the optimal choice of the respective tuning parameters. On the numerical side, we compare them in the pure function approximation case and in applications to uncertainty quantification of ODEs and PDEs with random inputs. Our main conclusion is that the lesser-known square-root LASSO is better suited for high-dimensional approximation than the other procedures in the case of bounded noise, since it avoids (both theoretically and numerically) the need for parameter tuning.",2019,Numerische Mathematik
Effect of Plant Geometry and Methods of Weed Control on Growth and Yield of Pigeonpea,"The experiments was conducted at the Crop Research Station, Bahraich, (U.P.) during kharif, 2009-10 and 2010-011 to evaluate the effect on plant geometry and methods of weed control on growth and yield of pigeonpea.

The treatment spacing of 60X20 cm and weed control application of lasso and one hand weeding found more production and remunerative than other treatments. The higher yield (27.98 q ha -1 ) was recorded under the spacing of 60X20 cm which was significantly better than other treatments. Application of lasso @ 2.0 litre ha -1 just after sowing and one hand weeding proved significantly better than other methods of weed control and",2012,

Content based image retrieval with sparse representations and local feature descriptors : A comparative study,"Abstract Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) has been widely studied in the last two decades. Unlike text based image retrieval techniques, visual properties of images are used to obtain high level semantic information in CBIR. There is a gap between low level features and high level semantic information. This is called semantic gap and it is the most important problem in CBIR. The visual properties were extracted from low level features such as color, shape, texture and spatial information in early days. Local Feature Descriptors (LFDs) are more successful to increase performance of CBIR system. Then, a semantic bridge is built with high level semantic information. Sparse Representations (SRs) have become popular to achieve this aim in the last years. In this study, CBIR models that use LFDs and SRs in literature are investigated in detail. The SRs and LFD extraction algorithms are tested and compared within a CBIR framework for different scenarios. Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HoG), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Local Ternary Pattern (LTP) are used to extract LFDs from images. Random Features, K-Means and K-Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD) algorithms are used for dictionary learning and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), Homotopy, Lasso, Elastic Net, Parallel Coordinate Descent (PCD) and Separable Surrogate Function (SSF) are used for coefficient learning. Finally, three methods recently proposed in literature (Online Dictionary Learning (ODL), Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) and Feature-based Sparse Representation (FBSR)) are also tested and compared with our framework results. All test results are presented and discussed. As a conclusion, the most successful approach in our framework is to use LLC for Coil20 data set and FBSR for Corel1000 data set. We obtain 89% and 58% Mean Average Precision (MAP) for Coil20 and Corel1000, respectively.",2017,Pattern Recognit.

Structural Diagnostics via Anomaly-driven Demixing of Wavefield Data,"This work introduces a method for the detection and triangulation of anomalous features in solid media. The strategy leverages an algorithm which demixes the dynamic system response data into two distinct components: the first characterized by spatially sparse, persistent features and the second comprising the relatively large, smooth features of the bulk response. In performing this demixing, we select a topologically suitable basis for each component and we seek an accurate representation of the data in terms of the respective bases. This task is cast in the form of a Group Lasso optimization problem and solved using a Block Coordinate Descent algorithmic approach. The resulting representation distills the signatures of potential anomalies from the bulk dynamic response, thus allowing an effortless determination of their location. The proposed method is baseline free, automated, unsupervised (it makes no use of training sets), and model agnostic (it makes virtually no use of material knowledge or constitutive behavior). These attributes are appealing in systems where there exists limited or unreliable a priori constitutive knowledge of the model, or when the physical domain is highly heterogeneous or compromised by large damage zones. The method is tested against synthetically generated data and experimental data obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. doi: 10.12783/SHM2015/155",2015,Structural Health Monitoring-an International Journal
Estimating global bank network connectedness,"We use LASSO methods to shrink, select, and estimate the highâ€dimensional network linking the publicly traded subset of the world's top 150 banks, 2003â€“2014. We characterize static network connectedness using fullâ€sample estimation and dynamic network connectedness using rollingâ€window estimation. Statically, we find that global bank equity connectedness has a strong geographic component, whereas country sovereign bond connectedness does not. Dynamically, we find that equity connectedness increases during crises, with clear peaks during the Great Financial Crisis and each wave of the subsequent European Debt Crisis, and with movements coming mostly from changes in crossâ€country as opposed to withinâ€country bank linkages.",2018,Journal of Applied Econometrics
Neuromodulations of Extro-Scientific Telepathy,"This paper speculates upon the possibilities of a telepathically enhanced culturalenvironment, which might create forms of modulation in the neural networks of the brain.The first uncertain challenge, in the section Telepathy and the Idea of the XSF, is tounderstand telepathy as Extro-Science Fiction (XSF) and show how XSF becomes real.XSF as understood by Quentin Meillassoux is contrasted to science fiction. Particularly Iwill concentrate on Meillasoux Type 2 worlds whose irregularity is sufficient to abolishscience but not consciousness. Through an exploration of the artist practices of RobertBarry, Marina Abramovic, and Susan Hiller employing telepathy, I will suggest these artexperiments produced information that science could not. These artists and their workhave laid the foundation for an integral understanding of telepathy, where telepathy inconceptual art processes are materially engaged with the brain, body and the world.Responding to a wealth of information manifesting in science fiction, these conceptual artpractices, within a sub-genre I call extro-science conceptual art, an extension of XSF intoart, have been reappearing in recent telepathic technologies. These conceptual artpractices become the first materializations in the cultural schemata of these technologiesand form a link to experiments with those of the 19th century to the present day. Theymanifest as migrations of the sensible and insensible, and form active visions to beharnessed by such things as material engagement theory (MET) and brain artifactinterfaces.

Using these theories as a foundation I analyze how a culturalenvironment in the process of becoming more telepathically inclined, as a result of moreembedded telepathic technologies, might in fact sculpt the brainâ€™s neural plasticity.",2017,
Accuracy of genomic selection in biparental populations of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.),"Abstract Flax is an important economic crop for seed oil and stem fiber. Phenotyping of traits such as seed yield, seed quality, stem fiber yield, and quality characteristics is expensive and time consuming. Genomic selection (GS) refers to a breeding approach aimed at selecting preferred individuals based on genomic estimated breeding values predicted by a statistical model based on the relationship between phenotypes and genome-wide genetic markers. We evaluated the prediction accuracy of GS ( r MP ) and the efficiency of GS relative to phenotypic selection ( RE ) for three GS models: ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), Bayesian LASSO (BL), and Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), for seed yield, oil content, iodine value, linoleic, and linolenic acid content with a full and a common set of genome-wide simple sequence repeat markers in each of three biparental populations. The three GS models generated similar r MP and RE , while BRR displayed a higher coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of the fitted models than did RR-BLUP or BL. The mean r MP and RE varied for traits with different heritabilities and was affected by the genetic variation of the traits in the populations. GS for seed yield generated a mean RE of 1.52 across populations and marker sets, a value significantly superior to that for direct phenotypic selection. Our empirical results provide the first validation of GS in flax and demonstrate that GS could increase genetic gain per unit time for linseed breeding. Further studies for selection of training populations and markers are warranted.",2016,Crop Journal
A Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso) for Nonlinear System Identification,"Abstract Identification of parametric nonlinear models involves estimating unknown parameters and detecting its underlying structure. Structure computation is concerned with selecting a subset of parameters to give a parsimonious description of the system which may afford greater insight into the functionality of the system or a simpler controller design. In this study, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) technique is investigated for computing efficient model descriptions of nonlinear systems. The LASSO minimises the residual sum of squares by the addition of a l1 penalty term on the parameter vector of the traditional l2 minimisation problem. Its use for structure detection is a natural extension of this constrained minimisation approach to pseudolinear regression problems which produces some model parameters that are exactly zero and, therefore, yields a parsimonious system description. The performance of this LASSO structure detection method was evaluated by using it to estimate the structure of a nonlinear polynomial model. Applicability of the method to more complex systems such as those encountered in aerospace applications was shown by identifying a parsimonious system description of the F/A-18 Active Aeroelastic Wing using flight test data.",2006,IFAC Proceedings Volumes
Comprehensive analysis and selection of anthrax vaccine adsorbed immune correlates of protection in rhesus macaques.,"Humoral and cell-mediated immune correlates of protection (COP) for inhalation anthrax in a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) model were determined. The immunological and survival data were from 114 vaccinated and 23 control animals exposed to Bacillus anthracis spores at 12, 30, or 52 months after the first vaccination. The vaccinated animals received a 3-dose intramuscular priming series (3-i.m.) of anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) (BioThrax) at 0, 1, and 6 months. The immune responses were modulated by administering a range of vaccine dilutions. Together with the vaccine dilution dose and interval between the first vaccination and challenge, each of 80 immune response variables to anthrax toxin protective antigen (PA) at every available study time point was analyzed as a potential COP by logistic regression penalized by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) or elastic net. The anti-PA IgG level at the last available time point before challenge (last) and lymphocyte stimulation index (SI) at months 2 and 6 were identified consistently as a COP. Anti-PA IgG levels and lethal toxin neutralization activity (TNA) at months 6 and 7 (peak) and the frequency of gamma interferon (IFN-Î³)-secreting cells at month 6 also had statistically significant positive correlations with survival. The ratio of interleukin 4 (IL-4) mRNA to IFN-Î³ mRNA at month 6 also had a statistically significant negative correlation with survival. TNA had lower accuracy as a COP than did anti-PA IgG response. Following the 3-i.m. priming with AVA, the anti-PA IgG responses at the time of exposure or at month 7 were practicable and accurate metrics for correlating vaccine-induced immunity with protection against inhalation anthrax.",2014,Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI
Feature selection in feature network models: finding predictive subsets of features with the Positive Lasso.,"A set of features is the basis for the network representation of proximity data achieved by feature network models (FNMs). Features are binary variables that characterize the objects in an experiment, with some measure of proximity as response variable. Sometimes features are provided by theory and play an important role in the construction of the experimental conditions. In some research settings, the features are not known a priori. This paper shows how to generate features in this situation and how to select an adequate subset of features that takes into account a good compromise between model fit and model complexity, using a new version of least angle regression that restricts coefficients to be non-negative, called the Positive Lasso. It will be shown that features can be generated efficiently with Gray codes that are naturally linked to the FNMs. The model selection strategy makes use of the fact that FNM can be considered as univariate multiple regression model. A simulation study shows that the proposed strategy leads to satisfactory results if the number of objects is less than or equal to 22. If the number of objects is larger than 22, the number of features selected by our method exceeds the true number of features in some conditions.",2008,The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology
Graph estimation for Gaussian data zero-inflated by double truncation,"We consider the problem of graph estimation in a zero-inflated Gaussian model. In this model, zero-inflation is obtained by double truncation (right and left) of a Gaussian vector. The goal is to recover the latent graph structure of the Gaussian vector with observations of the zero-inflated truncated vector. We propose a two step estimation procedure. The first step consists in estimating each term of the covariance matrix by maximising the corresponding bivariate marginal log-likelihood of the truncated vector. The second one uses the graphical lasso procedure to estimate the precision matrix sparsity, which encodes the graph structure. We then state some theoretical convergence results about the convergence rate of the covariance matrix and precision matrix esti-mators. These results allow us to establish consistency of our procedure with respect to graph structure recovery. We also present some simulation studies to corroborate the efficiency of our procedure.",2019,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Abstracts 10-4,"Clash of Career and Family: Fertility Decisions after Job Displacement Emilia Del Bono, University of Essex, Andrea Weber, University of Mannheim, and Rudolf WinterEbme University of Linz and IHS Vienna In this paper we investigate how career considerations may affect fertility decisions in the presence of a temporary employment shock. We compare the birth rates of women displaced by a plant closure with those of women unaffected by job loss after establishing the pre-displacement comparability of these groups. Our results reveal that job displacement reduces average fertility by 5%-10%, and that these effects are largely explained by the response of women in more skilled occupations. We offer an explanation of our results based on career interruptions of women. The Political Economy of Flexicurity Tito Boeri, UniversitÃ  Bocconi and Fondazione Rodolfo Debenedetti, Jose Ignacio Conde-Ruiz, Universidad Complutense de Madrid and FEDEA, and Vincenzo Galasso, UniversitÃ  Bocconi and Dondena We document the presence of a trade-off in the labor market between the protection of jobs and the support offered to unemployed people. Different countriesâ€™ locations along this trade-off represent stable politico-economic equilibria. We develop a model in which individuals determine the mix of job protection and support to the unemployed in a political environment. Agents are heterogeneous along two dimensions: employment status (insiders and outsiders) and skills (low and high). Unlike previous work on the political economy of labor market institutions, we emphasize the role of job protection and unemployment benefits in the wage setting process. A key implication of the model is that flexicurity configurations with low job protection and high support to the unemployed should emerge in presence of a highly educated workforce. Panel regressions of countriesâ€™ locations along this institutional trade-off are consistent with the implications of our model. Evolving International Inflation Dynamics: World and Country Specific Factors Haroon Mumtaz, Bank of England and Paolo Surico, London Business School The decline in the level and persistence of inflation over the 1980s is a common feature of the most industrialized economies in the world. The rise in inflation volatility of the late 1970s and the subsequent fall of the 1980s is country specific for the U.K., Canada and, to a lesser extent, U.S., Italy and Japan. Since the late 1980s, inflation predictability has declined significantly across the industrialized world. We link the empirical results to recent theories of international inflation. Do Hiring Subsidies Reduce Unemployment among Older Workers? Evidence from Natural Experiments Bernhard Boockmann, Institute for Applied Economic Research (IAW) and University of TÃ¼bingen, Thomas Zwick, Ludwig Maximilians University and ZEW, Andreas AmmermÃ¼ller, Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS), and Michael Maier, University of Mannheim We estimate the effects of hiring subsidies for older workers on transitions from unemployment to employment in Germany. Using a natural experiment, our first set of estimates is based on a legal change extending the group of eligible unemployed persons. A subsequent legal change in the opposite direction is used to validate these results. Our data cover the population of unemployed jobseekers in Germany and was specifically made available for our purposes from administrative data. Consistent support for an employment effect of hiring subsidies can only be found for women in East Germany. Concerning other population groups, firmsâ€™ hiring behavior is hardly influenced by the program and hiring subsidies mainly lead to deadweight effects.",2012,
QSAR modeling of benzimidazole derivatives as potent inhibitors of trichomoniasis / QSAR modellemesi ile Benzimidazole tÃ¼revlerinin trikomoniasis iÃ§in etkili inhibitÃ¶rler olarak kullanÄ±lmasÄ±,"Abstract Objective: Trichomoniasis can increase the risk of getting or spreading other sexually transmitted infections. It can cause genital inflammation that can increase the likelihood of infection with HIV or passing HIV on to a sex partner. The present study used QSAR modeling to study benzimidazole derivatives as potent inhibitors of trichomonicidal activity. A set of 10 compounds was randomly removed from the dataset to be used as the prediction set (PSET). The remaining 60 compounds were utilized as the training set (TSET). Methods: Genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks (ANN), multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares (PLS), principal component regression (PCR) and a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were used to create the QSAR models. Geometry optimization of compounds was carried out using the B3LYP method employing a 6-31G (2d) basis set. HyperChem, Gaussian 03W and Dragon (version 5.5) software were used for geometric optimization of the molecules and calculation of the quantum chemical descriptors. Unscrambler was used for analysis of data. Results: The MLR method obtained a root mean square error (RMSE) for calibration of 0.0803 and R2 of 0.99. The R2 and RMSE of calibration using PCR were 0.58 and 0.5236, respectively.

"Variations in some physico-chemical parameters in a hypersaline coastal lagoon of Baja California, Mexico","San Jose lagoon is a hypersaline body of water located in Mexico in the Baja California Peninsula. The lagoon belongs to a system that lies between the fault ridge known as San Jose Creek. Because of its marine origin, it can be considered as thalassohaline, but its isolation from the ocean has brought about changes in its salt composition. It has an area of 13,500 m2, a mean depth of 80 cm and a total volume of 10,000 m3. It does not desiccate and can be considered as a permanent lagoon. Seasonal variations are small. TheArtemia population in San Jose produces cysts all year. To determine the physico-chemical conditions inducing permanent production of cysts, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH of the lagoon were monitored, as well as relative humidity and wind conditions in the region in different seasons of the year. From spring to summer, differences of 1 mg Lâˆ’1 of O2, 1Â°C in water temperature, and 8 g Lâˆ’1 in salinity were observed, and from summer to winter differences of 3.3 mg Lâˆ’1, 6.5Â°C, and 14 g Lâˆ’1, respectively. Despite small seasonal variations, the lagoon exhibits strong spatial and daily changes that are important for cyst production.",1995,International Journal of Salt Lake Research

To reduce the dimensionality, feature selection best subset Logistic Regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Random Forest approaches have been utilized. The focus was to check the prediction accuracy and performance of these classification methods after feature selection on full as well as reduced model. The output showed that reduce subset of variables which is attained through Random Forest has best accuracy with the classification method random forest. In this way, we can rely on the subset of variables obtained from Random Forest as it has almost same percentage of accuracy as compared to the full model.",2018,
Edge Preserving and Noise Reducing Reconstruction for Magnetic Particle Imaging,"Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging medical imaging modality which is based on the non-linear response of magnetic nanoparticles to an applied magnetic field. It is an important feature of MPI that even fast dynamic processes can be captured for 3D volumes. The high temporal resolution in turn leads to large amounts of data which have to be handled efficiently. But as the system matrix of MPI is non-sparse, the image reconstruction gets computationally demanding. Therefore, currently only basic image reconstruction methods such as Tikhonov regularization are used. However, Tikhonov regularization is known to oversmooth edges in the reconstructed image and to have only a limited noise reducing effect. In this work, we develop an efficient edge preserving and noise reducing reconstruction method for MPI. As regularization model, we propose to use the nonnegative fused lasso model, and we devise a discretization that is adapted to the acquisition geometry of the preclinical MPI scanner considered in this work. We develop a customized solver based on a generalized forward-backward scheme which is particularly suitable for the dense and not well-structured system matrices in MPI. Already a non-optimized prototype implementation processes a 3D volume within a few seconds so that processing several frames per second seems amenable. We demonstrate the improvement in reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art method in an experimental medical setup for an in-vitro angioplasty of a stenosis.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
Adaptive Tiling: Applying Fixed-size Systolic Arrays To Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks,"We introduce adaptive tiling, a method of partitioning layers in a sparse convolutional neural network (CNN) into blocks of filters and channels, called tiles, each implementable with a fixed-size systolic array. By allowing a tile to adapt its size so that it can cover a large sparse area, we minimize the total number of tiles, or equivalently, the number of systolic array calls required to perform CNN inference. The proposed scheme resolves a challenge of applying systolic array architectures, traditionally designed for dense matrices, to sparse CNNs. To validate the approach, we construct a highly sparse Lasso-Mobile network by pruning MobileNet trained with an $\ell_{1}$ regularization penalty, and demonstrate that adaptive tiling can lead to a 2- $3\mathbf{x}$ reduction in systolic array calls, on Lasso-Mobile, for several benchmark datasets.",2018,2018 24th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)
An MM-Based Optimization Algorithm for Sparse Linear Modeling on Microarray Data Analysis,"Sparsity is crucial for high-dimensional statistical modeling. On one hand, dimensionality reduction can reduce the variability of estimation and thus provide reliable predictive power. On the other hand, the selected sub-model can discover and emphasize the underlying dependencies, which is useful for objective interpretation. Many variable selection methods have been proposed in literatures. For a prominent example, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso) in linear regression context has been extensively explored. This paper discusses a class of scaled mixture of Gaussian models from both a penalized likelihood and a Bayesian regression point of view. We propose an Majorize-Minimize (MM) algorithm to find the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator, where the EM algorithm can be stuck at local optimum for some members in this class. Simulation studies show the outperformance of proposed algorithm in nonstochastic design variable selection scenario. The proposed algorithm is applied to a real large-scale E.coli data set with known bona fide interactions for constructing sparse gene regulatory networks. We show that our regression networks with a properly chosen prior can perform comparably to state-of-the-art regulatory network construction algorithms.",2009,2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering
