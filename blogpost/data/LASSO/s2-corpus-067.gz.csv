Translating Interdisciplinarity: Reading MartÃ­ Reading Whitman,"I see the superior oceans and the inferior ones, the Atlantic and Pacific, the sea of Mexico, the Brazilian sea, and the sea of Peru.... I see the Brazilian vaquero, I see the Bolivian ascending mount Sorata, I see the Wacho crossing the plains, I see the incomparable rider of horses with his lasso on his arm, I see over the pampas the pursuit of wild cattle for their hides. Walt Whitman, ""Salut au monde!"" (1) [Whitman] seldom read any book deliberately through, and there was no more (apparent) system about his reading than in anything else that he did; that is to say, there was no system about it at all. If he sat in the library an hour, he would have half a dozen to a dozen volumes about him, on the table, on chairs and on the floor. He seemed to read a few pages here and a few pages there, and pass from place to place, from volume to volume, doubtless pursuing some clue or thread of his own. Sometimes (though very seldom) he would get sufficiently interested in a volume to read it all.... In his way of reading he dipped into histories, essays, metaphysical, religious and scientific treatises, novels and poetry--though I think he read less poetry than anything else. He read no language but English, yet I believe he knew a great deal more French, German and Spanish than he would own to. Richard Maurice Bucke, Cosmic Consciousness (2) Walt Whitman never saw most of the myriad places he name-checks in ""Salut au Monde,"" in fact never traveled beyond North America. (3) That minor technicality does not stop him from envisioning them--""seeing"" them, as it were--through the lens of his own mystical, abstracted vision of an America at once generalized and exceptional. The first proposition of this essay is that Whitman's unfamiliarity with the rest of the world, in all its political, economic, and above all cultural diversity and difference, crucially informs his ability to envision it as he does: as an undifferentiated Other (""indifferent of place,"" as he puts it) facilely reducible to ""Camerados"" [sic] in turn subsumed into his Hegelian vision of America as an ever-expanding end-of-History. It is a tautology all the more breathtaking for its near-perfect crystallization of American exceptionalism, then and now, as simultaneously teleological and horizonless: prophesy as inescapable world-without-end. Whitman did not recite ""Salut au monde"" during his appearance at New York's Madison Square Theater on April 14, 1887, an event biographers consider the apogee of his life as a public figure. In truth, such a poem would not have been appropriate, as Whitman's appearance was advertised as a lecture on Abraham Lincoln. Although Whitman did not come close to filling the great hall, the reverence and adulation among those in attendance--many of them VIPs in their own right--did much to cement Whitman's lasting legacy as the most important American poet of his time. Among the many who came to pay tribute to the grand old man were fellow poets James Russell Lowell and Edmund Clarence Stedman; Mark Twain; John Hay, former secretary to Lincoln and future U.S. Secretary of State; and Andrew Carnegie, who paid $350 for his own box. (4) Jose Marti was there too. Unlike Carnegie, Marti's $1.50 ticket would have only bought him a seat among the anonymous hundreds who came to hear Whitman recite ""O Captain! My Captain!"" and reminisce about the late, great President. Some scholars believe, however, that the two met and may have exchanged brief pleasantries at a reception for Whitman later that night. (5) No record exists of the two poets' brief conversation, which in any case probably consisted of little beyond the requisite niceties, if it happened at all. If that conversation did happen, however, it certainly took place in English: Given Marti's near-native fluency in the language and Whitman's minimal grasp of Spanish, it is the only plausible option. Marti also read Leaves of Grass in the original English; no published Spanish translation existed until 1912, and French translations of Whitman were only just appearing at the time of their meeting in 1887. â€¦",2011,The Comparatist
Exposure levels to brominated compounds in seawater swimming pools treated with chlorine.,"Despite evidence of formation of brominated compounds in seawater swimming pools treated with chlorine, no data about exposure levels to these compounds have been reported. To address this issue, a survey has been carried out in four establishments (representing 8 pools) fed with seawater and devoted to relaxing and cure treatments (thalassotherapy centres located in Southeast of France). Carcinogenic and mutagenic brominated disinfection byproducts (trihalomethanes -THM- and halogenated acetic acids -HAA-) were quantified at varying levels, statistically related to organic loadings brought by bathers, and not from marine organic matter, and also linked to activities carried out in the pools (watergym vs swimming). Bromoform and dibromoacetic acid, the most abundant THM and HAA detected, were measured at levels up to 18-fold greater than the maximum contaminant levels of 60 and 80Â Î¼g/L fixed by US.EPA in drinking waters. The correlations between these disinfection byproducts and other environmental factors such as nitrogen, pH, temperature, free residual chlorine, UV(254), chloride and bromide concentrations, and daily frequentation were examined. Because thalassotherapy and seawater swimming pools (hotels, cruise ships,â€¦) are increasing in use around the world and because carcinogenic and mutagenic brominated byproducts may be produced in chlorinated seawater swimming pools, specific care should be taken to assure cleanliness of users (swimmers and patients taking the waters) and to increase water circulation through media filters to reduce levels of brominated byproducts.",2012,Water research

Estimation of Sparse Structural Parameters with Many Endogenous Variables,"We apply the generalized method of momentsâ€“least absolute shinkage and selection operator (GMM-Lasso) (Caner, 2009) to a linear structural model with many endogenous regressors. If the true parameter is sufficiently sparse, we can establish a new oracle inequality, which implies that GMM-Lasso performs almost as well as if we knew a priori the identities of the relevant variables. Sparsity, meaning that most of the true coefficients are too small to matter, naturally arises in econometric applications where the model can be derived from economic theory. In addition, we propose to use a modified version of AIC or BIC to select the tuning parameter in practical implementation. Simulations provide supportive evidence concerning the finite sample properties of the GMM-Lasso.",2016,Econometric Reviews

Dynamic and Modularized MicroRNA Regulation and Its Implication in Human Cancers,"MicroRNA is responsible for the fine-tuning of fundamental cellular activities and human disease development. The altered availability of microRNAs, target mRNAs, and other types of endogenous RNAs competing for microRNA interactions reflects the dynamic and conditional property of microRNA-mediated gene regulation that remains under-investigated. Here we propose a new integrative method to study this dynamic process by considering both competing and cooperative mechanisms and identifying functional modules where different microRNAs co-regulate the same functional process. Specifically, a new pipeline was built based on a meta-Lasso regression model and the proof-of-concept study was performed using a large-scale genomic dataset from ~4,200 patients with 9 cancer types. In the analysis, 10,726 microRNA-mRNA interactions were identified to be associated with a specific stage and/or type of cancer, which demonstrated the dynamic and conditional miRNA regulation during cancer progression. On the other hands, we detected 4,134 regulatory modules that exhibit high fidelity of microRNA function through selective microRNA-mRNA binding and modulation. For example, miR-18a-3p, âˆ’320a, âˆ’193b-3p, and âˆ’92b-3p co-regulate the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and focal adhesion in cancers of kidney, liver, lung, and uterus. Furthermore, several new insights into dynamic microRNA regulation in cancers have been discovered in this study.",2017,Scientific Reports
Performance Analysis of Sparse Recovery Based on Constrained Minimal Singular Values,"The stability of sparse signal reconstruction with respect to measurement noise is investigated in this paper. We design efficient algorithms to verify the sufficient condition for unique <i>â„“</i><sub>1</sub> sparse recovery. One of our algorithms produces comparable results with the state-of-the-art technique and performs orders of magnitude faster. We show that the <i>â„“</i><sub>1</sub> -constrained minimal singular value (<i>â„“</i><sub>1</sub>-CMSV) of the measurement matrix determines, in a very concise manner, the recovery performance of <i>â„“</i><sub>1</sub>-based algorithms such as the Basis Pursuit, the Dantzig selector, and the LASSO estimator. Compared to performance analysis involving the Restricted Isometry Constant, the arguments in this paper are much less complicated and provide more intuition on the stability of sparse signal recovery. We show also that, with high probability, the subgaussian ensemble generates measurement matrices with <i>â„“</i><sub>1</sub>-CMSVs bounded away from zero, as long as the number of measurements is relatively large. To compute the <i>â„“</i><sub>1</sub>-CMSV and its lower bound, we design two algorithms based on the interior point algorithm and the semidefinite relaxation.",2011,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
Un percorso d'autonomia accelerato : il ruolo della figura educativa all'interno del SEA in previsione di un inserimento abitativo esterno,"A differenza di altri foyer presenti sul territorio ticinese, gli Spazi Abitativi (SA) del Centro Professionale e Sociale (CPS) hanno la particolarita di chiudere durante i fine settimana e nel periodo delle vacanze lavorative. Questo poiche bisogna considerare il Centro come una sorta di datore di lavoro, ragion per cui lâ€™accompagnamento abitativo offerto parte dal lunedi sera fino al venerdi mattina, tenendo quale riferimento la settimana lavorativa. 
Per tale motivo, i giovani adulti che usufruiscono di questo servizio sono tenuti, nelle occasioni dove il CPS chiude, a rientrare presso il proprio domicilio privato. E per chi non ha questa possibilita? Purtroppo sempre piu spesso ci si trova confrontati con situazioni di giovani utenti che riscontrano importanti difficolta nel rientrare presso il proprio domicilio, a causa di conflittualita con la famiglia. Come affrontare questa problematica? Lâ€™idea affrontata allâ€™interno di questo LT e di creare un progetto dâ€™autonomia specifico che permetta al giovane interessato di â€œallenarsiâ€ e poter acquisire determinate competenze ritenute necessarie per unâ€™entrata in appartamento privato. 
E importante premettere che lo Spazio Abitativo di Bellinzona nasce come una scuola dâ€™autonomia, cio significa che lâ€™obiettivo principale e proprio quello di favorire lâ€™acquisizione di nuove competenze, necessarie sia per lâ€™entrata nel mondo del lavoro, sia per la gestione della quotidianita. Dunque, il fattore che differenzia il progetto sviluppato in questo lavoro di tesi rispetto a quello gia esistente allâ€™interno del servizio, e il tempo. Infatti, il percorso dâ€™autonomia allâ€™interno dello SA ha la possibilita di dipanarsi tra i due e i tre anni. Nelle situazioni dâ€™emergenza pero, dove gli utenti non hanno unâ€™abitazione stabile, non si ha questo intero lasso di tempo a disposizione. Alla luce di queste riflessioni nasce lâ€™impegno, oltre che la necessita, di sviluppare un progetto con tempistiche diverse, ma con lo stesso obiettivo finale; per questo motivo la scelta del titolo e ricaduta su â€œUn percorso dâ€™autonomia acceleratoâ€. 
Attraverso un percorso di progettualita condivisa, lâ€™obiettivo e di individuare unâ€™attivita valorizzante che consentira al giovane adulto di lavorare per acquisire sia delle competenze pratiche, necessarie al mantenimento di un appartamento, sia delle competenze sociali, quali la gestione delle emozioni e delle relazioni.",2015,
Primitives for Dynamic Big Model Parallelism,"When training large machine learning models with many variables or parameters, a single machine is often inadequate since the model may be too large to fit in memory, while training can take a long time even with stochastic updates. A natural recourse is to turn to distributed cluster computing, in order to harness additional memory and processors. However, naive, unstructured parallelization of ML algorithms can make inefficient use of distributed memory, while failing to obtain proportional convergence speedups â€” or can even result in divergence. We develop a framework of primitives for dynamic model-parallelism, STRADS, in order to explore partitioning and update scheduling of model variables in distributed ML algorithms â€” thus improving their memory efficiency while presenting new opportunities to speed up convergence without compromising inference correctness. We demonstrate the efficacy of model-parallel algorithms implemented in STRADS versus popular implementations for Topic Modeling, Matrix Factorization and Lasso.",2014,ArXiv
Comparison of Machine Learning Methods With National Cardiovascular Data Registry Models for Prediction of Risk of Bleeding After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention,"Importance
Better prediction of major bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may improve clinical decisions aimed to reduce bleeding risk. Machine learning techniques, bolstered by better selection of variables, hold promise for enhancing prediction.


Objective
To determine whether machine learning techniques better predict post-PCI major bleeding compared with the existing National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) models.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This comparative effectiveness study used the NCDR CathPCI Registry data version 4.4 (July 1, 2009, to April 1, 2015), machine learning techniques were used (logistic regression with lasso regularization and gradient descent boosting [XGBoost, version 0.71.2]), and output was then compared with the existing simplified risk score and full NCDR models. The existing models were recreated, and then performance was evaluated through additional techniques and variables in a 5-fold cross-validation in analysis conducted from October 1, 2015, to October 27, 2017. The setting was retrospective modeling of a nationwide clinical registry of PCI. Participants were all patients undergoing PCI. Percutaneous coronary intervention procedures were excluded if they were not the index PCI of admission, if the hospital site had missing outcomes measures, or if the patient underwent subsequent coronary artery bypass grafting.


Exposures
Clinical variables available at admission and diagnostic coronary angiography data were used to determine the severity and complexity of presentation.


Main Outcomes and Measures
The main outcome was in-hospital major bleeding within 72 hours after PCI. Results were evaluated by comparing C statistics, calibration, and decision threshold-based metrics, including the F score (harmonic mean of positive predictive value and sensitivity) and the false discovery rate.


Results
The post-PCI major bleeding rate among 3â€¯316â€¯465 procedures (patients' median age, 65 years; interquartile range, 56-73 years; 68.1% male) was 4.5%. The existing full model achieved a mean C statistic of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.78-0.78). The use of XGBoost and full range of selected variables achieved a C statistic of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.82-0.82), with an F score of 0.31 (95% CI, 0.30-0.31). XGBoost correctly identified an additional 3.7% of cases identified as high risk who experienced a bleeding event and an overall improvement of 1.0% of cases identified as low risk who did not experience a bleeding event. The data-driven decision threshold helped improve the false discovery rate of the existing techniques. The existing simplified risk score model improved the false discovery rate from more than 90% to 78.7%. Modifying the model and the data decision threshold improved this rate from 78.7% to 73.4%.


Conclusions and Relevance
Machine learning techniques improved the prediction of major bleeding after PCI. These techniques may help to better identify patients who would benefit most from strategies to reduce bleeding risk.",2019,JAMA Network Open
Electrical disconnection versus anatomical isolation of the pulmonary veins: two sides of the same treatment for atrial fibrillation?,"OBJECTIVE
There are currently two techniques for percutaneous electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins (PV): anatomical isolation and electrical disconnection. The aim of the present study was to assess the continuity and circumferential extension of the radiofrequency applications necessary for PV electrical disconnection in order to evaluate the differences between this technique and anatomical isolation.


METHODS
We studied 9 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who underwent PV electrical disconnection. The electrophysiologic study was performed with a decapolar circular catheter (Lasso) introduced in the PV ostia and a mapping and ablation catheter (CARTO). Ablation was performed following the activation sequence of PV potentials. Using the CARTO system we evaluated the number of applications, their distribution in quadrants, and the maximum distance between contiguous and opposite RF applications. We assessed the number of veins with circumferential applications. The number of applications and maximum distance between contiguous applications were compared to the maximum distance between opposite applications.


RESULT
A total of 26 PV were isolated, including 9 right superior, 5 right inferior, 6 left superior and 6 left inferior. On average more than 10 applications were necessary, with a heterogeneous distribution. In 80.8% of the PVs the maximum distance between contiguous application was less than 1 cm and maximum distance between opposite application were highest in the right superior PV and lowest in the right inferior PV. The applications were circumferential in 80.8% of the disconnections. The number of RF applications was significantly higher in PVs with greater distances between opposite applications (correlation coefficient 0.51; p=0.008). No relation was found between maximum distances in contiguous and opposite applications (correlation coefficient r=0.13; p=NS).


CONCLUSION
Electrical disconnection was achieved in the great majority of cases with circumferential applications, similarly to anatomical isolation. However, the heterogeneous distribution of the applications implies the existence of areas that need a greater number of applications and that can only be identified during electrophysiologic study. Therefore, rather than two aspects of the same treatment for atrial fibrillation, electrical disconnection and anatomical isolation complement each other in the achievement of effective PV isolation.",2003,Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology
Exploiting Spatial Sparsity in Vibration-Based Damage Detection,"One of the main limitations traditionally encountered in vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM) is detecting, localizing and quantifying localized damage using global response measurements. This paper presents an impulse response sensitivity approach enhanced with a LASSO regularization in order to detect spatially sparse (localized) damage. The analytical expression for impulse response sensitivity was derived using Vetter calculus. The proposed algorithm exploits the fact that when damage is sparse, an l1-norm regularization is more suitable than the more common least squares (l2-norm) minimization. The proposed methodology is successfully applied in the context of a simulated non-uniform shear cantilever beam with noise-contaminated inputâ€“output measurements.",2017,Procedia Engineering
Mean and variance estimation in high-dimensional heteroscedastic models with non-convex penalties,"Despite its prevalence in statistical datasets, heteroscedasticity (non-constant sample variances) has been largely ignored in the high-dimensional statistics literature. Recently, studies have shown that the Lasso can accommodate heteroscedastic errors, with minor algorithmic modifications (Belloni et al., 2012; Gautier and Tsybakov, 2013). In this work, we study heteroscedastic regression with linear mean model and log-linear variances model with sparse high-dimensional parameters. In this work, we propose estimating variances in a post-Lasso fashion, which is followed by weighted-least squares mean estimation. These steps employ non-convex penalties as in Fan and Li (2001), which allows us to prove oracle properties for both post-Lasso variance and mean parameter estimates. We reinforce our theoretical findings with experiments.",2014,arXiv: Statistics Theory

Selective Inference and Learning Mixed Graphical Models,"This thesis studies two problems in modern statistics. First, we study selective inference, or inference for hypothesis that are chosen after looking at the data. The motiving application is inference for regression coefficients selected by the lasso. We present the Condition-on-Selection method that allows for valid selective inference, and study its application to the lasso, and several other selection algorithms. 
In the second part, we consider the problem of learning the structure of a pairwise graphical model over continuous and discrete variables. We present a new pairwise model for graphical models with both continuous and discrete variables that is amenable to structure learning. In previous work, authors have considered structure learning of Gaussian graphical models and structure learning of discrete models. Our approach is a natural generalization of these two lines of work to the mixed case. The penalization scheme involves a novel symmetric use of the group-lasso norm and follows naturally from a particular parametrization of the model. We provide conditions under which our estimator is model selection consistent in the high-dimensional regime.",2015,ArXiv
Subspecific Status of Least Tern Populations,"ABSTRACr.-Analyses of seven bill, leg, wing, and plumage characters measured from 267 museum specimens of adult Least Terns (Sterna antillarum) revealed significant morphological differences between sexes but not among three subspecies (antillarum, athalassos, and browni) currently recognized in North America. While individual morphometric characters sometimes did not overlap between a pair of subspecies, discriminant analysis employing criteria developed from the complete morphometnrc data set correctly classified >90% of antillarum specimens but misclassified 39% and 5 1% of athalassos and browni specimens, respectively. Cluster analysis did not segregate specimens into groups consistent with current subspecific taxonomy. Electrophoretic variation in proteins encoded by 50 loci revealed no genetic distinctions between S. a. antillarum and S. a. athalassos for 22 specimens from four breeding sites on the Texas coast, Rio Grande, and Texas panhandle rivers. These data illustrated continued difficulty in distinguishing endangered and nonendangered ""forms"" of the same species. Distinctions proposed in original descriptions of North American Least Tern subspecies are not sufficiently definitive; we recommend reassessment of subspecies within the entire species taxon.

Post-Prognostics Decision for Optimizing the Commitment of Fuel Cell Systems,"Abstract: In a post-prognostics decision context, this paper addresses the problem of maximizing the useful life of a platform composed of several parallel machines under service constraint. Application on multi-stack fuel cell systems is considered. In order to propose a solution to the insufficient durability of fuel cells, the purpose is to define a commitment strategy by determining at each time the contribution of each fuel cell stack to the global output so as to reach the demand as long as possible. Two algorithms making use of convex optimization are proposed to cope with the assignment problem. First one is based on the Mirror-prox for Saddle Points method and second one uses the Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) principle. Results based on computational experiments assess the efficiency of these two approaches in comparison with an intuitive resolution performing successive basic convex projections onto the sets of constraints associated to the optimization problem.",2017,ArXiv

Single-snapshot DOA estimation by using Compressed Sensing,"This paper deals with the problem of estimating the directions of arrival (DOA) of multiple source signals from a single observation vector of an array data. In particular, four estimation algorithms based on the theory of compressed sensing (CS), i.e., the classical â„“1 minimization (or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, LASSO), the fast smooth â„“0 minimization, and the Sparse Iterative Covariance-Based Estimator, SPICE and the Iterative Adaptive Approach for Amplitude and Phase Estimation, IAA-APES algorithms, are analyzed, and their statistical properties are investigated and compared with the classical Fourier beamformer (FB) in different simulated scenarios. We show that unlike the classical FB, a CS-based beamformer (CSB) has some desirable properties typical of the adaptive algorithms (e.g., Capon and MUSIC) even in the single snapshot case. Particular attention is devoted to the super-resolution property. Theoretical arguments and simulation analysis provide evidence that a CS-based beamformer can achieve resolution beyond the classical Rayleigh limit. Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by processing a real sonar dataset.",2014,EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing
Cognitive pathways in small businesses decision-making processes,"The significant role small firms play in the global economy has stimulated research on this field to determine how the peculiarities of these firms could affect the way they are managed. Acknowledging the limited usefulness of the rationality model to explain decision-making in small firms (Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Papadakis, Lioukas, & Chambers, 1998; Brouthers, Andriessen, & Nicolaes, 1998; Gilmore & Carson, 2000), we suggest that the more willing entrepreneurs use their instincts for decision-making in order to guarantee their ability to adapt to environmental changes (Gibcus, Vermeulen, & De Jong, 2009). Particularly, accounting scholars have focused their attention on the limited diffusion of managerial accounting practices in small firms. They recognize the internal culture, the lack of managerial capacity, and the limited capital resources as the main factors that could hinder the diffusion of managerial accounting practices (Chenhall, 2003; Garengo, Biazzo, & Bititci, 2005; Broccardo, Giacosa, Culasso, & Ferraris, 2017).

Development of a Predictive Model of Tuberculosis Transmission among Household Contacts,"Background
Household contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB) are at great risk of TB infection. The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model of TB transmission among household contacts.


Method
This was a secondary analysis of data from a prospective cohort study, in which a total of 700 TB patients and 3417 household contacts were enrolled between 2010 and 2013 at two study sites in Peru. The incidence of secondary TB cases among household contacts of index cases was recorded. The LASSO regression method was used to reduce the data dimension and to filter variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to develop the predictive model, and internal validation was performed. A nomogram was constructed to display the model, and the AUC was calculated. The calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) were also evaluated.


Results
The incidence of TB disease among the contacts of index cases was 4.4% (149/3417). Ten variables (gender, age, TB history, diabetes, HIV, index patient's drug resistance, socioeconomic status, spoligotypes, and the index-contact share sleeping room status) filtered through the LASSO regression technique were finally included in the predictive model. The model showed good discriminatory ability, with an AUC value of 0.761 (95% CI, 0.723-0.800) for the derivation and 0.759 (95% CI, 0.717-0.796) for the internal validation. The predictive model showed good calibration, and the DCA demonstrated that the model was clinically useful.


Conclusion
A predictive model was developed that incorporates characteristics of both the index patients and the contacts, which may be of great value for the individualized prediction of TB transmission among household contacts.",2019,The Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases & Medical Microbiology = Journal Canadien des Maladies Infectieuses et de la Microbiologie MÃ©dicale
A Prognostic Signature for Lower Grade Gliomas Based on Expression of Long Non-Coding RNAs,"Diffuse low-grade and intermediate-grade gliomas (together known as lower grade gliomas, WHO grade II and III) develop in the supporting glial cells of brain and are the most common types of primary brain tumor. Despite a better prognosis for lower grade gliomas, 70% of patients undergo high-grade transformation within 10Â years, stressing the importance of better prognosis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are gaining attention as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We have developed a computational model, UVA8, for prognosis of lower grade gliomas by combining lncRNA expression, Cox regression, and L1-LASSO penalization. The model was trained on a subset of patients in TCGA. Patients in TCGA, as well as a completely independent validation set (CGGA) could be dichotomized based on their risk score, a linear combination of the level of each prognostic lncRNA weighted by its multivariable Cox regression coefficient. UVA8 is an independent predictor of survival and outperforms standard epidemiological approaches and previous published lncRNA-based predictors as a survival model. Guilt-by-association studies of the lncRNAs in UVA8, all of which predict good outcome, suggest they have a role in suppressing interferon-stimulated response and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The expression levels of eight lncRNAs can be combined to produce a prognostic tool applicable to diverse populations of glioma patients. The 8 lncRNA (UVA8) based score can identify grade II and grade III glioma patients with poor outcome, and thus identify patients who should receive more aggressive therapy at the outset.",2018,Molecular Neurobiology
A prognostic tool to predict outcomes in children undergoing the Norwood operation,"Objectives: To create and validate a prediction model to assess outcomes associated with the Norwood operation. Methods: The publicâ€use dataset from a multicenter, prospective, randomized singleâ€ventricle reconstruction trial was used to create this novel prediction tool. A Bayesian lasso logistic regression model was used for variable selection. We used a hierarchical framework by representing discrete probability models with continuous latent variables that depended on the risk factors for a particular patient. Bayesian conditional probit regression and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations were then used to estimate the effects of the predictors on the means of these latent variables to create a score function for each of the study outcomes. We also devised a method to calculate the risk of outcomes associated with the Norwood operation before the actual heart operation. The 2 study outcomes evaluated were inâ€hospital mortality and composite poor outcome. Results: The training dataset used 520 patients to generate the prediction model. The model included patient demographics, baseline characteristics, cardiac diagnosis, operation details, site volume, and surgeon experience. An online calculator for the tool can be accessed at https://soipredictiontool.shinyapps.io/NorwoodScoreApp/. Model validation was performed on 520 observations using an internal 10â€fold crossâ€validation approach. The prediction model had an area under the curve of 0.77 for mortality and 0.72 for composite poor outcome on the validation dataset. Conclusions: Our new prognostic tool is a promising first step in creating realâ€time risk stratification in children undergoing a Norwood operation; this tool will be beneficial for the purposes of benchmarking, family counseling, and research.",2017,The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery
A mathematical framework for virtual IMRT QA using machine learning.,"PURPOSE
It is common practice to perform patient-specific pretreatment verifications to the clinical delivery of IMRT. This process can be time-consuming and not altogether instructive due to the myriad sources that may produce a failing result. The purpose of this study was to develop an algorithm capable of predicting IMRT QA passing rates a priori.


METHODS
From all treatment, 498 IMRT plans sites were planned in eclipse version 11 and delivered using a dynamic sliding window technique on Clinac iX or TrueBeam Linacs. 3%/3 mm local dose/distance-to-agreement (DTA) was recorded using a commercial 2D diode array. Each plan was characterized by 78 metrics that describe different aspects of their complexity that could lead to disagreements between the calculated and measured dose. A Poisson regression with Lasso regularization was trained to learn the relation between the plan characteristics and each passing rate.


RESULTS
Passing rates 3%/3 mm local dose/DTA can be predicted with an error smaller than 3% for all plans analyzed. The most important metrics to describe the passing rates were determined to be the MU factor (MU per Gy), small aperture score, irregularity factor, and fraction of the plan delivered at the corners of a 40 Ã— 40 cm field. The higher the value of these metrics, the worse the passing rates.


CONCLUSIONS
The Virtual QA process predicts IMRT passing rates with a high likelihood, allows the detection of failures due to setup errors, and it is sensitive enough to detect small differences between matched Linacs.",2016,Medical physics
Spatial Filtering for EEG-Based Regression Problems in Brainâ€“Computer Interface (BCI),"Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are frequently used in brainâ€“computer interfaces (BCIs), but they are easily contaminated by artifacts and noise, so preprocessing must be done before they are fed into a machine learning algorithm for classification or regression. Spatial filters have been widely used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG for BCI classification problems, but their applications in BCI regression problems have been very limited. This paper proposes two common spatial pattern (CSP) filters for EEG-based regression problems in BCI, which are extended from the CSP filter for classification, by using fuzzy sets. Experimental results on EEG-based response speed estimation from a large-scale study, which collected 143 sessions of sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task data from 17 subjects during a 5-month period, demonstrate that the two proposed spatial filters can significantly increase the EEG signal quality. When used in LASSO and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula>-nearest neighbors regression for user response speed estimation, the spatial filters can reduce the root-mean-square estimation error by <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$10.02-19.77\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and at the same time increase the correlation to the true response speed by <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$19.39-86.47\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems
Chemical Defense and Antifouling Activity of Three Mediterranean Sponges of the Genus Ircinia,"The defense roles and the antifouling activity of the organic extracts and the major metabolites of the sponges Ircinia oros, I. variabilis and I. spinosula were investigated. The antifeedant activity was tested in experimental aquaria on the generalist predator fish Thalassoma pavo as well as in coastal ecosystems rich in fishes. Some of the major metabolites exhibited high levels of antifeedant activity. The antifouling activity was tested in laboratory assays, against representatives of the major groups of fouling organisms (marine bacteria, marine fungi, diatoms, macroalgae and mussels). All extracts showed promising levels of activity. As was expected, no single extract was active in all tests and some fractions that were effective against one organism showed little or no activity against the others. The high but variable level of antifouling activity in combination with the absence of toxicity (tested on the development of oyster and sea urchin larvae) shows the potential of these metabolites to become ingredients in environmentally friendly antifouling preparations.",2002,Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Naturforschung C
Three cases of invasive meningococcal disease caused by a capsule null locus strain circulating among healthy carriers in Burkina Faso.,"During reinforced surveillance of acute bacterial meningitis in Burkina Faso, meningococcal strains of phenotype NG:NT:NST were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid samples from 3 patients. The strains were negative for the ctrA gene but were positive for the crgA gene. Molecular typing revealed that the strains harbored the capsule null locus (cnl) and belonged to the multilocus sequence type (ST)-192. PorA sequencing showed that all strains were either P1.18-11,42; P1.18,42-1; P1.18-11,42-1; P1.18-11,42-3; or P1.18-12,42-1. Sequencing also showed that all strains were negative for the FetA receptor gene. Serum killing assays showed these strains to be resistant, with the resistance comparable with that of a fully capsular serogroup B strain, MC58. The same strains were found in 14 healthy carriers in the general population of Bobo-Dioulasso (100% of ST-192 isolates tested for cnl). The presence of cnl meningococci that can escape serum killing and cause invasive disease is of concern for future vaccination strategies and should promote rigorous surveillance of cnl meningococcal disease.",2007,The Journal of infectious diseases
From Lasso regression to Feature vector machine,"Lasso regression tends to assign zero weights to most irrelevant or redundant features, and hence is a promising technique for feature selection. Its limitation, however, is that it only offers solutions to linear models. Kernel machines with feature scaling techniques have been studied for feature selection with non-linear models. However, such approaches require to solve hard non-convex optimization problems. This paper proposes a new approach named the Feature Vector Machine (FVM). It reformulates the standard Lasso regression into a form isomorphic to SVM, and this form can be easily extended for feature selection with non-linear models by introducing kernels defined on feature vectors. FVM generates sparse solutions in the nonlinear feature space and it is much more tractable compared to feature scaling kernel machines. Our experiments with FVM on simulated data show encouraging results in identifying the small number of dominating features that are non-linearly correlated to the response, a task the standard Lasso fails to complete.",2005,
Fast and Accurate Least-Mean-Squares Solvers,"Least-mean squares (LMS) solvers such as Linear / Ridge / Lasso-Regression, SVD and Elastic-Net not only solve fundamental machine learning problems, but are also the building blocks in a variety of other methods, such as decision trees and matrix factorizations. 
We suggest an algorithm that gets a finite set of $n$ $d$-dimensional real vectors and returns a weighted subset of $d+1$ vectors whose sum is \emph{exactly} the same. The proof in Caratheodory's Theorem (1907) computes such a subset in $O(n^2d^2)$ time and thus not used in practice. Our algorithm computes this subset in $O(nd)$ time, using $O(\log n)$ calls to Caratheodory's construction on small but ""smart"" subsets. This is based on a novel paradigm of fusion between different data summarization techniques, known as sketches and coresets. 
As an example application, we show how it can be used to boost the performance of existing LMS solvers, such as those in scikit-learn library, up to x100. Generalization for streaming and distributed (big) data is trivial. Extensive experimental results and complete open source code are also provided.",2019,ArXiv
"ULTRASTRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE BASAL DINOFLAGELLATE Ellobiopsis chattoni ( ELLOBIOPSIDAE , ALVEOLATA ) , PARASITE OF","Ellobiopsis chattoni is the type species of the ellobiopsids, an enigmatic lineage of parasitic alveolates that branched between the syndinean dinoflagellates and the perkinsids. We have investigated the ultrastructure of four trophonts from three calanoid copepod hosts collected from the port of Valencia, northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The cell wall showed a thick and homogenous layer and flask-shaped mucocysts that excreted an electron-dense substance that forms the outer layer. The cell wall in the attachment peduncle of Ellobiopsis was thicker and with numerous invaginations. The inner section showed numerous longitudinal channels here interpreted as conduits for the transport of host fluids. Trophomere and gonomere were separated by a thin septum with a central pore. Before the mature gonomere detached from the trophomere, the area of junction became undulated. Deficiencies in the fixation of the membrane organelle preclude discussing on other ultrastructural features. To date the ultrastructure of three ellobiopsid genera have been examined. The trophonts of Ellobiopsis and Thalassomyces showed a high similarity in the cell wall, with characteristic flaskshaped mucocysts. The lack of flask-shaped mucocysts in Ellobiocystis and other morphological and ecological differences argue against the monophyly of the ellobiopsids.",2015,
Learning GMRF Structures for Spatial Priors,"The goal of this paper is to find sparse and representative spatial priors that can be applied to part-based object localization. Assuming a GMRF prior over part configurations, we construct the graph structure of the prior by regressing the position of each part on all other parts, and selecting the neighboring edges using a Lasso-based method. This approach produces a prior structure which is not only sparse, but also faithful to the spatial dependencies that are observed in training data. We evaluate the representation power of the learned prior structure in two ways: first is drawing samples from the prior, and comparing them with the samples produced by the GMRF priors of other structures; second is comparing the results when applying different priors to a facial components localization task. We show that the learned graph captures meaningful geometrical variations with significantly sparser structure and leads to better parts localization results.",2007,2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
The effect of unemployment on the smoking behavior of couples.,"Although unemployment likely entails various externalities, research examining its spillover effects on spouses is scarce. This is the first paper to estimate effects of unemployment on the smoking behavior of both spouses. Using German Socio-Economic Panel data, we combine matching and difference-in-differences estimation, employing the post-double-selection method for control variable selection via Lasso regressions. One spouse's unemployment increases both spouses' smoking probability and intensity. Smoking relapses and decreased smoking cessation drive the effects. Effects are stronger if the partner already smokes and if the male partner becomes unemployed. Of several mechanisms discussed, we identify smoking to cope with stress as relevant.",2019,Health economics
High Dimensional Modelling,"This chapter describes methods suitable for high-dimensional graphical modeling. Recent years have seen intense interest in applying graphical modeling techniques to data of high dimension: by this we mean from hundreds to tens of thousands of variables. Such data arise routinely in fields such as molecular biology. We first describe two typical datasets: one from a study of gene expression in breast cancer patients, and the other from the HapMap project, in which a large number of genomic markers and gene expression measurements are recorded for 90 individuals. We compare the computational efficiency of some model selection algorithms, as applied to one of the example datasets. Of these, an extension of the Chow-Liu algorithm to find the minimal BIC forest, implemented in the gRapHD package, is found to be most efficient. Also the glasso algorithm and a stepwise decomposable search algorithm are highly efficient. We describe these algorithms in more detail and illustrate their use on the example datasets. Finally, as a more advanced example, we illustrate how a Bayesian equivalent to the minimal BIC forest algorithm for high-dimensional discrete data may be obtained. Assuming a hyper-Dirichlet prior, the maximum a posteriori forest is derived by using the extended Chow-Liu algorithm with appropriate user-defined edge weights. This is illustrated using a subset of the HapMap data.",2012,
Chapter 6 Interleukin-l Receptor Type I Gene-Deficient Mice are less Susceptible to Staphylococcus epidermidis Biomaterial-Associated Infection,"Elevated concentrations of interleukin (IL)-l were found in tissue surrounding biomaterials infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis. To determine the role of IL-1 in biomaterialassociated infection (BAI), IL-1 receptor type I deficient (IL-1R-/-) and wild-type mice received subcutaneous implants of silicon elastomer (SE) or polyvinylpyrrolidone-grafted SE (SEpvp), combined with an injection of 10 cfu S. epidermidis or sterile saline. Neither mouse strain was susceptible to BAI around SE. IL-1R-/mice had a no abscess formation and a reduced susceptibility to persistent S. epidermidis-infection associated with SEpvp. The foreign body response, characterized by giant-cell formation and encapsulation, was delayed around SEpvp in wild-type mice but not in IL-1R-/mice. This coincided with enhanced local IL-4 production in IL-1R-/mice. These data suggest that inhibition of local IL-1 activity may be beneficial for the outcome of BAI.",2012,

Kernel Learning: Automatic Selection of Optimal Kernels,"Kernel methods are widely used to address a variety of learning tasks including classification, regression, ranking, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. The appropriate choice of a kernel is often left to the user. But, poor selections may lead to sub-optimal performance. Furthermore, searching for an appropriate kernel manually may be a time-consuming and imperfect art. Instead, the kernel selection process can be included as part of the overall learning problem. In this way, better performance guarantees can be given and the kernel selection process can be made automatic. In this workshop, we will be concerned with using sampled data to select or learn a kernel function or kernel matrix appropriate for the specific task at hand. We will discuss several scenarios, including classification, regression, and ranking, where the use of kernels is ubiquitous, and different settings including inductive, transductive, or semi-supervised learning. We also invite discussions on the closely related fields of features selection and extraction, and are interested in exploring further the connection with these topics. The goal is to cover all questions related to the problem of learning kernels: different problem formulations, the computational efficiency and accuracy of the algorithms that address these problems and their different strengths and weaknesses, and the theoretical guarantees provided. What is the computational complexity? Does it work in practice? The formulation of some other learning problems, e.g. multi-task learning problems, is often very similar. These problems and their solutions will also be discussed in this workshop. 7:30-8:00 Invited Speaker: Shai Ben-David The Sample Complexity of Learning the Kernel 8:00-8:20 Olivier Chapelle and Alain Rakotomamonjy Second Order Optimization of Kernel Parameters 8:20-8:50 Invited Speaker: William Stafford Noble Multi-Kernel Learning for Biology 8:50-9:20 Poster Session and Discussion 9:20-9:40 Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri and Afshin Rostamizadeh Learning Sequence Kernels 9:40-10:00 Maria-Florina Balcan, Avrim Blum and Nathan Srebro Learning with Multiple Similarity Functions 10:00-10:30 Invited Speaker: Andreas Argyriou Multi-Task Learning via Matrix Regularization 10:30-15:30 Break until afternoon session. 15:30-16:00 Invited Speaker: Isabelle Guyon Feature Selection: From Correlation to Causality 16:00-16:20 Nathan Srebro and Shai Ben-David Learning Bounds for Support Vector Machines with Learned Kernels 16:20-16:50 Invited Speaker: Alex Smola Mixed Norm Kernels, Hyperkenels and Other Variants 16:50-17:20 Poster Session and Discussion 17:20-17:40 Marius Kloft, Ulf Brefeld, Pavel Laskov and SÃ¶ren Sonnenburg Non-sparse Multiple Kernel Learning 17:40-18:00 Peter Gehler Infinite Kernel Learning 18:00-18:30 Invited Speaker: John Shawe-Taylor Kernel Learning for Novelty Detection 18:30 Closing Remarks The Sample Complexity of Learning the Kernel Shai Ben-David, University of Waterloo The success of kernel based learning algorithms depends upon the suitability of the kernel to the learning task. Ideally, the choice of a kernel should based on prior information of the learner about the task at hand. However, in practice, kernel parameters are being tuned based on available training data. I will discuss the sample complexity overhead associated with such â€learning the kernelâ€ scenarios. I will address the setting in which the training data for the kernel selection is target labeled examples, as well as settings in which this training is based on different types of data, such as unlabeled examples and examples labeled by a different (but related) tasks. Part of this work is joint with Nati Srebro. Second Order Optimization of Kernel Parameters Olivier Chapelle et al., Yahoo! Research & University Rouen We investigate the use of second order optimization approaches for solving the multiple kernel learning (MKL) problem. We show that the hessian of the MKL can be computed efficiently and this information can be used to compute a better descent direction than the gradient (used in the state-of-the-art SimpleMKL algorithm). We then empirically show that our new approaches outperforms SimpleMKL in terms of computational efficiency. Multi-Kernel Learning for Biology William Stafford Noble, University of Washington One of the primary tasks facing biologists today is to integrate the different views of molecular biology that are provided by various types of experimental data. In yeast, for example, for a given gene we typically know the protein it encodes, that proteinâ€™s similarity to other proteins, the mRNA expression levels associated with the given gene under hundreds of experimental conditions, the occurrences of known or inferred transcription factor binding sites in the upstream region of that gene, and the identities of many of the proteins that interact with the given geneâ€™s protein product. Each of these distinct data types provides one view of the molecular machinery of the cell. Kernel methods allow us to represent these heterogeneous data types in a normal form, and to use kernel algebra to reason about more than one type of data simultaneously. Consequently, multi-kernel learning methods have been applied to a variety of biology applications. In this talk, I will describe several of these applications, outline the lessons we have learned from applying multi-kernel learning methods to real data, and suggest several avenues for future research in this area. Learning Sequence Kernels Corinna Cortes et al., Google Research & Courant Institute Kernel methods are used to tackle a variety of learning tasks including classification, regression, ranking, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. The appropriate choice of a kernel is often left to the user. But, poor selections may lead to a sub-optimal performance. Instead, sample points can be used to learn a kernel function appropriate for the task by selecting one out of a family of kernels determined by the user. This paper considers the problem of learning sequence kernel functions, an important problem for applications in computational biology, natural language processing, document classification and other text processing areas. For most kernel-based learning techniques, the kernels selected must be positive definite symmetric, which, for sequence data, are found to be rational kernels. We give a general formulation of the problem of learning rational kernels and prove that a large family of rational kernels can be learned efficiently using a simple quadratic program both in the context of support vector machines and kernel ridge regression. This improves upon previous work that generally results in a more costly semi-definite or quadratically constrained quadratic program. Furthermore, in the specific case of kernel ridge regression, we give an alternative solution for the optimal kernel matrix, which in fact coincides with the objective prescribed by kernel alignment techniques. Learning with Multiple Similarity Functions Maria-Florina Balcan et al., Microsoft Research & Carnegie Mellon University & Toyota Technological Institute Kernel functions have become an extremely popular tool in machine learning, with many applications and an attractive theory. There has also been substantial work on learning kernel functions from data [LCBGJ04,SB06,AHMP08]. A sufficient condition for a kernel to allow for good generalization on a given learning problem is that it induce a large margin of separation between positive and negative classes in its implicit space. In recent work [BBS08,BBS07,BB06] we have developed a theory that more broadly holds for general similarity functions that are not necessarily legal kernel functions. In particular, we give sufficient conditions for a similarity function to be useful for learning that (a) are fairly natural and intuitive (do not require an implicit space and allow for functions that are not positive semi-definite) and (b) strictly generalize the notion of a large-margin kernel function in that any such kernel also satisfies these conditions, though not necessarily vice-versa. We also have partial progress on extending the theory of learning with multiple kernel functions to these more general conditions. In this talk we describe the main definitions and results of [BBS08], give our results on learning with multiple similarity functions, and present several open questions about learning good general similarity functions from data. Multi-Task Learning via Matrix Regularization Andreas Argyriou, University College London We present a method for learning representations shared across multiple tasks. The method consists in learning a low-dimensional subspace on which task regression vectors lie. Our formulation is a convex optimization problem, which we solve with an alternating minimization algorithm. This algorithm can be shown to always converge to an optimal solution. Our method can also be viewed as learning a linear kernel shared across the tasks and hence as an instance of kernel learning in which there are infinite kernels available. Moreover, the method can easily be extended in order to learn multiple tasks using nonlinear kernels. To justify this, we present general results characterizing representer theorems for matrix learning problems like the one above, as well as standard representer theorems. Finally, we briefly describe how our method connects to approaches exploiting sparsity such as group Lasso. Feature Selection: From Correlation to Causality Isabelle Guyon, Clopinet, Berkeley Variable and feature selection have become the focus of much research in areas of application for which datasets with tens or hundreds of thousands of variables are available.

Inflammatory mechanisms and anti-inflammatory therapy in Alzheimer's disease,"OVERVIEW of this volume with a short history of the subject: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive dementing illness that causes neurodegeneration in highly selective regions of the forebrain. Remarkable recent progress from genetic approaches has led to the identification of relatively infrequent familialassociated AD genes on chromosomes 1, 14, and 21. A greater portion of the familial and sporadic AD cases are associated with inheritance of the apoE4 allele on chromosome 19. Nonetheless, little is understood about how this diverse array of genes leads to such similar pathologic endpoints or what the optimum treatments might be for therapy or prevention. Similarly, intensive studies of the two prominent ""hallmarks"" of AD neuropathology; neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, have revealed much about cellular and molecular processes. However, we do not yet know the primary causes of neurodegeneration from genetic or possible environmental causes. Interventions to supplement failing neurotransmitter systems or heroic efforts to provide beneficial neurotrophic factors have so far addressed only single aspects of the multisystem, highly selective, neurodegeneration that is characteristic of this disease. The first mechanisms and therapeutic targets to be seriously studied in AD derived from the seminal observations of Bowen et al. (2) and Davies and Maloney in 1976 (6), that postmortem AD brains typically showed > 50% deficits in choline acetyl transferase. The neurochemical and neuronal deficits in the forebrain cholinergic system in AD were consistent with a crucial role of cholinergic functions in memory and the greater sensitivity of older individuals to memory impairments from acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (7). We all recognize the major field that has developed from these early observations. While the cholinergic strategy continues to be explored clinically on a large scale, antiinflammatory drugs have recently entered the therapeutic race. The editors of this volume believe that therapies designed to slow or halt the disease at all sites of involvement must target fundamental pathologic processes of the disease. By recent evidence, one such process may be the glial reactions and other manifestations of inflammatory reactions in AD brains. Gliosis was recognized by Alois Alzheimer in his first description of AD brain (1). The presence of activated astrocytes and",1996,Neurobiology of Aging
Regularization and model selection for quantile varying coefficient model with categorical effect modifiers,"A varying coefficient model with categorical effect modifiers is an effective modeling strategy when the data set includes categorical variables. With categorial predictors the number of parameters can become very large. This paper focuses on the model selection problem for varying coefficient model with categorical effect modifiers under the framework of quantile regression. After distinguishing between nominal and ordinal effect modifiers, a unified (adaptive-) Lasso-type regularization technique is proposed that allows for selection of covariates and fusion of categories of categorical effect modifiers, which can identify whether the coefficient functions are really varying with the level of a potentially effect modifying factor and provide a sparse model at different quantile levels. Moreover, the large sample properties are derived under appropriate conditions including a fixed bound on the number of parameters. The proposed methods are illustrated and investigated by extensive simulation studies and two real data evaluations.",2014,Comput. Stat. Data Anal.
Model selection via penalization in the additive Cox model,"The Cox proportional hazards model is the most popular model for the analysis of survival data. It allows estimating the relationship between covariates and a possibly censored failure time. The corresponding partial likelihood estimators are used for the estimation and prediction of relative risk of failure. However, if the explanatory variables are highly correlated or if the number of failures is not much greater than the number of covariates of interest, then partial likelihood estimators are unstable and have large variance. Penalization is extensively used to address these difficulties. It decreases the predictor variability to improve the accuracy of prediction. Ridge regression (l2-penalization) is one of the main penalization procedures. It has been generalized to the nonparametric setting to reduce the possibility of overfitting with high dimensional models. Thus, smoothing splines are used to estimate flexibly covariate effects in the additive Cox model. Tibshirani's lasso (l1-penalization) has also been applied to the Cox model, providing an alternative to quadratic penalization. An attractive feature of the l1-penalization is that it shrinks coefficients and sets some of them to zero, performing parameter estimation and variable selection simultaneously. We propose a new algorithm for variable selection and function estimation in the additive Cox model. The method is based on a generalization of the lasso to the nonparametric setting. Our proposal maximizes a penalized partial likelihood that includes a double penalty: on the l1-norm of linear components and on the (generalized) l1-norm of nonlinear components of spline coefficients. Because of their nature, these penalties shrink linear and nonlinear compounds, some of them reducing exactly to zero. Hence they give parsimonious models, select significant variables, and reveal nonlinearities in the effects of predictors. Our approach is compared to standard methods by simulations and an example. Different techniques to choose the penalty parameters are also tested.",2005,

An Exploratory Analysis of Biased Learners in Soft-Sensing Frames,"Data driven soft sensor design has recently gained immense popularity, due to advances in sensory devices, and a growing interest in data mining. While partial least squares (PLS) is traditionally used in the process literature for designing soft sensors, the statistical literature has focused on sparse learners, such as Lasso and relevance vector machine (RVM), to solve the high dimensional data problem. In the current study, predictive performances of three regression techniques, PLS, Lasso and RVM were assessed and compared under various offline and online soft sensing scenarios applied on datasets from five real industrial plants, and a simulated process. In offline learning, predictions of RVM and Lasso were found to be superior to those of PLS when a large number of time-lagged predictors were used. Online prediction results gave a slightly more complicated picture. It was found that the minimum prediction error achieved by PLS under moving window (MW), or just-in-time learning scheme was decreased up to ~5-10% using Lasso, or RVM. However, when a small MW size was used, or the optimum number of PLS components was as low as ~1, prediction performance of PLS surpassed RVM, which was found to yield occasional unstable predictions. PLS and Lasso models constructed via online parameter tuning generally did not yield better predictions compared to those constructed via offline tuning. We present evidence to suggest that retaining a large portion of the available process measurement data in the predictor matrix, instead of preselecting variables, would be more advantageous for sparse learners in increasing prediction accuracy. As a result, Lasso is recommended as a better substitute for PLS in soft sensors; while performance of RVM should be validated before online application.",2019,ArXiv

We propose a sliding window approach that uses multimarker genotypes as variables in a penalized regression. We investigate a penalty with three separate components: (1) a group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) that selects multimarker genotypes in a gene to be included in or excluded from the model, (2) an allele-sharing penalty that encourages multimarker genotypes with similar alleles to have similar coefficients, and (3) a penalty that shrinks the size of coefficients while performing model selection. The penalized likelihood is minimized with a cyclic coordinate descent algorithm, allowing quick coefficient estimation for a large number of markers. We compare our method to single-marker analysis and a gene-based sparse group LASSO on the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 data for quantitative trait Q2. We found that all of the methods were underpowered to detect the simulated rare causal variants at the low false-positive rates desired in association studies. However, the sparse group LASSO on multi-marker genotypes seems to provide some advantage over the sparse group LASSO applied to single SNPs within genes, giving further evidence that there may be an advantage to modeling combinations of rare variant alleles over modeling them individually.",2011,BMC Proceedings
Radiomics nomogram for preoperative differentiation of lung tuberculoma from adenocarcinoma in solitary pulmonary solid nodule.,"PURPOSE
To investigate the preoperative differential diagnostic performance of a radiomics nomogram in tuberculous granuloma (TBG) and lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) appearing as solitary pulmonary solid nodules (SPSNs).


METHOD
We retrospectively recruited 426 patients with SPSNs from two centers and assigned them to training (nâ€¯=â€¯123), internal validation (nâ€¯=â€¯121), and external validation cohorts (nâ€¯=â€¯182). A model of deep learning (DL) was built for tumor segmentation from routine computed tomography (CT) images and extraction of 3D radiomics features. We used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression to build a radiomics signature. A clinical model was developed with clinical factors, including age, gender, and CT-based subjective findings (eg, lesion size, lesion location, lesion margin, lobulated sharp, and spiculation sign). We constructed individualized radiomics nomograms incorporating the radiomics signature and clinical factors to validate the diagnostic ability.


RESULTS
Three factors - radiomics signature, age, and spiculation sign - were found to be independent predictors and were used to build the radiomics nomogram, which showed better diagnostic accuracy than any single model (all net reclassification improvement pâ€¯<â€¯0.05). The area under curve yielded was 0.9660 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9390-0.9931), 0.9342 (95% CI, 0.8944-0.9739), and 0.9064 (95% CI, 0.8639-0.9490) for the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and stratification analysis showed the nomogram has potential for generalizability.


CONCLUSION
The radiomics nomogram we developed can preoperatively distinguish between LAC and TBG in patient with a SPSN.",2020,European journal of radiology
Statistical Debugging Using a Hierarchical Model of Correlated Predicates,"The aim of statistical debugging is to identify faulty predicates that have strong effect on program failure. In this paper predicates are fitted into a linear regression model to consider the vertical effect of predicates on each other and on program termination status. Prior approaches have merely considered predicates in isolation. The proposed approach in this paper is a twostep procedure which includes hierarchical clustering and the Lasso regression method. Hierarchical clustering builds a tree structure of correlated predicates. The Lasso method is applied on the clusters in some specified levels of the tree. This makes the method scalable in terms of the size of a program. Unlike other statistical methods which do not provide any context of the failure, the predicates contained in the group that is provided by this method can be used as the bug signature. The method has been evaluated on two well-known test suites, Space and Siemens. The experimental results reveal the accuracy and precision of the approach comparing with similar techniques.",2011,
Variable selection methods in multivariate statistical process control: A systematic literature review,"Abstract Technological advances led to increasingly larger industrial quality-related datasets calling for process monitoring methods able to handle them. In such context, the application of variable selection (VS) in quality control methods emerges as a promising research topic. This review aims at presenting the current state-of-the-art of the integration of VS in multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) methods. Proposals aligned with the objective were identified, classified according to VS approach, and briefly presented. Research on the topic has considerably increased in the past five years. Thirty methods were identified and categorized in 10 clusters, according to the objective of improvement in MSPC and the step of process monitoring they were aimed to improve. The majority of the propositions were either targeted at exclusively monitoring potential out-of-control variables or improving the monitoring of in-control variables. MSPC improvements were centered in principal component analysis (PCA) projection methods, while VS was mainly carried out using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method and genetic algorithms. Fault isolation was the most addressed step in process monitoring. We close the paper proposing five topics for future research, exploring the opportunities identified in the literature.",2018,Comput. Ind. Eng.
Local Religion or Cult-Shopping? : A Sacrificial Site in Burkina Faso,"Dafra is a sacrificial site near Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Fasos's second-largest and predominantly Muslim city. Dafra has the reputation of being a powerful place where wishes made and confirmed by vows will be fulfilled. People come to Dafra because of illness, infertility, lack of money, failure in school or business, or nightmares. Although at first sight Dafra appears to be an archetypical African shrine, pilgrims are adherents to different religions and come from all over Burkina Faso, neighboring countries, and even from as far as Europe or the U.S.A. The example of Dafra shows that practices which appear to represent ""traditional religion"" are neither traditional nor homogeneous nor uncontroversial.",2014,
Building communities. Presenting a model of community formation and organizational complexity in southwestern Anatolia,"Abstract In this paper, a model of community formation and organizational complexity is presented, focusing on the fundamental role of social interactions and information transmission for the development of complex social organisation. The model combines several approaches in complex systems thinking which has garnered increasing attention in archaeology. It is then outlined how this conceptual model can be applied in archaeology. In the absence of direct observations of constituent social interactions, archaeologists study the past through material remnants found in the archaeological record. People used their material surroundings to shape, structure and guide social interactions and practices in various ways. The presented framework shows how dynamics of social organisation and community formation can be inferred from these material remains. The model is applied on a case study of two communities, Sagalassos and Duzen Tepe, located in southwestern Anatolia during late Achaemenid to middle Hellenistic times (fifth to second centuries BCE). It is suggested that constituent interactions and practices can be linked to the markedly different forms of organizational structures and material surroundings attested in both communities. The case study illustrates how the presented model can help understand trajectories of socio-political structures and organizational complexity on a community level.",2019,Journal of Anthropological Archaeology
Recurrent atrial arrhythmia in patients with atrial fibrillation following pulmonary vein isolation.,"A 48-year-old male who had recurrent atrial arrhythmia following catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) was hospitalized in our hospital. The pulmonary veins (PVs) had been individually isolated from the left atrium (LA) at their ostium by using a 4 mm extra-irrigated ablation catheter (EZ Steer Thermocool NAV, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA). The elimination of dormant PV conduction, which was induced by the rapid injection of adenosine triphosphate, had been performed following the isolation of PVs. At 5 months after the ablation procedure, the patient suffered from frequent episodes of palpitation. The surface 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during palpitation demonstrated frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) followed by a nonsustained AF. An electrophysiological study and catheter ablation to treat the recurrent atrial arrhythmia were conducted after the patient provided his informed consent. A steerable 16-polar 2 site (6-polar for right atrium and 10-polar for coronary sinus) mapping catheter (InquiryTM Luma-CathTM, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) was inserted into the coronary sinus positioned at 4â€“5 oâ€™clock along the mitral annulus in the left anterior oblique projection via the right subclavian vein. The LA and PVs were explored through transseptal catheterization with 2 long sheaths. The reconnection between the PV and LA was evaluated by using circular mapping catheters (Lasso, Biosense Webster). A 4 mm extra-irrigated ablation catheter was used for mapping and ablation (EZ Steer Thermocool NAV, Biosense Webster). The surface electrocardiogram and bipolar endocardial electrograms were continuously monitored and recorded for off-line analysis (Bard Electrophysiology, Lowell, MA, USA). In the left superior PV (LSPV), the rapid regular PV activities were recorded by a circular catheter during sinus rhythm with frequent PACs (Fig. 1).

"Sungsanpin, a lasso peptide from a deep-sea streptomycete.","Sungsanpin (1), a new 15-amino-acid peptide, was discovered from a Streptomyces species isolated from deep-sea sediment collected off Jeju Island, Korea. The planar structure of 1 was determined by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and UV spectroscopy. The absolute configurations of the stereocenters in this compound were assigned by derivatizations of the hydrolysate of 1 with Marfey's reagents and 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-Î²-d-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate, followed by LC-MS analysis. Careful analysis of the ROESY NMR spectrum and three-dimensional structure calculations revealed that sungsanpin possesses the features of a lasso peptide: eight amino acids (-Gly(1)-Phe-Gly-Ser-Lys-Pro-Ile-Asp(8)-) that form a cyclic peptide and seven amino acids (-Ser(9)-Phe-Gly-Leu-Ser-Trp-Leu(15)) that form a tail that loops through the ring. Sungsanpin is thus the first example of a lasso peptide isolated from a marine-derived microorganism. Sungsanpin displayed inhibitory activity in a cell invasion assay with the human lung cancer cell line A549.",2013,Journal of natural products
Sparse Representation of Wannier Functions from $L_1$ Regularized Optimization,"Author(s): Chen, Jiatong | Advisor(s): Ozolins, Vidvuds; Streit, Dwight | Abstract: Wannier functions are real-space localized wavefunctions for electronic systems. The construction of Wannier functions from Schr quot;{o}dinger equation has been extensively studied in the community of condensed matter physics. The most widely used scheme is to minimize spread functional, i.e., second moment, with respect to the gauge matrices, resulting in the maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) \cite{PhysRevB.56.12847,PhysRevB.65.035109,RevModPhys.84.1419}.The recent advancement in machine learning, image processing and compressive sensing has brought tremendous computational efficiency to study complex many-particle systems, in terms of solving non-convex and non-differentiable optimization problems. Inspired by the variable selection property of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) \cite{10.2307/2346178,hastie01statisticallearning} in machine learning, we calculate Wannier functions by minimizing total energy plus an $L_1$ regularization term. The resulting ""compressed"" Wannier functions have compact support, which means they are localized only within a finite region and are strictly zero outside.Another question considered in this dissertation is how to calculate symmetry-adapted Wannier functions. We show that induced group representation theory fits nicely into our variational formula. Same algorithms work equally well for both metals and insulators, in a sense that no prior disentanglement procedure is needed for our calculations. When symmetry constraints are incorporated, it suffices to use Gaussians at Wannier centers as initial trial functions for all the orbitals. Such algorithms have been implemented in planewaves-pseudopotential codes for real materials simulations.",2018,
Disentangling the causal effects of air pollutants on health: when the numerous characteristics of the planetary boundary layer can help,"Quasi-experimental evidence increasingly support the air pollution detrimental effect on health, but the question of which air pollutants impact which pathology remains largely open. In this paper, we exploit a novel sets of instruments: altitude weather conditions, and more specifically the characteristics of the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Numerous physical characteristics may influence differently the air pollutantsâ€™ concentrations. By selecting optimal instruments from a large set of PBL characteristics with a IV Lasso procedure, we disentangle the impact of six air pollutants. We find that at least three air pollutants, ozone, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide, have a strong effect on respiratory diseases, independently of each other, even when controlling for the other pollutants in presence. Children are mostly affected. As for cardiovascular diseases and the mortality rate, our results point out to respectively carbon monoxide and particulate matters.",2019,

"Identification and individualized prediction of clinical phenotypes in bipolar disorders using neurocognitive data, neuroimaging scans and machine learning","ABSTRACT Diagnosis, clinical management and research of psychiatric disorders remain subjective â€” largely guided by historically developed categories which may not effectively capture underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of dysfunction. Here, we report a novel approach of identifying and validating distinct and biologically meaningful clinical phenotypes of bipolar disorders using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. First, neurocognitive data were analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning approach and two distinct clinical phenotypes identified namely; phenotype I and phenotype II. Second, diffusion weighted imaging scans were preâ€processed using the tractâ€based spatial statistics (TBSS) method and â€˜skeletonizedâ€™ white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps extracted. The â€˜skeletonizedâ€™ white matter FA and MD maps were entered into the Elastic Net machine learning algorithm to distinguish individual subjects' phenotypic labels (e.g. phenotype I vs. phenotype II). This calculation was performed to ascertain whether the identified clinical phenotypes were biologically distinct. Original neurocognitive measurements distinguished individual subjects' phenotypic labels with 94% accuracy (sensitivity = 92%, specificity = 97%). TBSS derived FA and MD measurements predicted individual subjects' phenotypic labels with 76% and 65% accuracy respectively. In addition, individual subjects belonging to phenotypes I and II were distinguished from healthy controls with 57% and 92% accuracy respectively. Neurocognitive task variables identified as most relevant in distinguishing phenotypic labels included; Affective Go/Noâ€Go (AGN), Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) coupled with inferior frontoâ€occipital fasciculus and callosal white matter pathways. These results suggest that there may exist two biologically distinct clinical phenotypes in bipolar disorders which can be identified from healthy controls with high accuracy and at an individual subject level. We suggest a strong clinical utility of the proposed approach in defining and validating biologically meaningful and less heterogeneous clinical subâ€phenotypes of major psychiatric disorders. HighlightsAn unsupervised machine learning method and neurocognitive data used to identify two phenotypesLASSO distinguished two phenotypes using neurocognitive data with 94% accuracy.Elastic Net validates differences of the two phenotypes using FA data with 76% accuracy.Healthy controls are further used to validate differences between the two phenotypes.",2017,NeuroImage
Learning Low-rank and Sparse Discriminative Correlation Filters for Coarse-to-Fine Visual Object Tracking,"Discriminative correlation filter (DCF) has achieved advanced performance in visual object tracking with remarkable efficiency guaranteed by its implementation in the frequency domain. However, the effect of the structural relationship of DCF and object features has not been adequately explored in the context of the filter design. To remedy this deficiency, this paper proposes a Low-rank and Sparse DCF (LSDCF) that improves the relevance of features used by discriminative filters. To be more specific, we extend the classical DCF paradigm from ridge regression to lasso regression, and constrain the estimate to be of low-rank across frames, thus identifying and retaining the informative filters distributed on a low-dimensional manifold. To this end, specific temporal-spatial-channel configurations are adaptively learned to achieve enhanced discrimination and interpretability. In addition, we analyse the complementary characteristics between hand-crafted features and deep features, and propose a coarse-to-fine heuristic tracking strategy to further improve the performance of our LSDCF. Last, the augmented Lagrange multiplier optimisation method is used to achieve efficient optimisation. The experimental results obtained on a number of well-known benchmarking datasets, including OTB2013, OTB50, OTB100, TC128, UAV123, VOT2016 and VOT2018, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, delivering outstanding performance compared to the state-of-the-art trackers.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology
Universal disease biomarker: can a fixed set of blood microRNAs diagnose multiple diseases?,"BackgroundThe selection of disease biomarkers is often difficult because of their unstable identification, i.e., the selection of biomarkers is heavily dependent upon the set of samples analyzed and the use of independent sets of samples often results in a completely different set of biomarkers being identified. However, if a fixed set of disease biomarkers could be identified for the diagnosis of multiple diseases, the difficulties of biomarker selection could be reduced.ResultsIn this study, the previously identified universal disease biomarker (UDB) consisting of blood miRNAs that could discriminate between patients with multiple diseases and healthy controls was extended to the recently reported independent measurements of blood microRNAs (miRNAs). The performance achieved by UDB in an independent set of samples was competitive with performances achieved with biomarkers selected using lasso, a standard, heavily sample-dependent procedure. Furthermore, the development of stable feature extraction was suggested to be a key factor in constructing more efficient and stable (i.e., sample- and disease-independent) UDBs.ConclusionsThe previously proposed UDB was successfully extended to an additional seven diseases and is expected to be useful for the diagnosis of other diseases.",2013,BMC Research Notes
Untersuchung zur Pharmakokinetik des Arzneistoffes Romifidin hinsichtlich der Dopingrelevanz beim Pferd,"The aim of the present study was
 to develop a new analytical method for the analysis of romifidine in
 horsesâ€™ plasma and urine samples. With the new method some
 pharmacokinetic studies were done on these samples. The basis for the
 development of the new analytical method was some established routine
 procedures at the Institute of Biochemistry at the Deutsche Sporthochschule
 in Cologne. For the detection of romifidine in plasma and urine samples a
 liquid-liquid-extraction was done first. After the evaporation of the ether
 phase the samples were dissolved again in an ammonium acetate buffer for
 analysis. Some urine samples were prepared for hydrolysis. It could be proved
 that the parent compound is freely excreted in urine. Clonidine was chosen
 for the internal standard. The recovery rates of the method were 60.3 % for
 plasma and 80.0 % for urine. The limit of detection was fixed at 8 ng/ml for
 plasma and at 20 ng/ml for urine.
 For pharmacokinetic studies
 romifidine was administered in a single intravenous dose of 0.08 mg/kg BW.
 Besides getting plasma and urine samples some pharmacodynamic parameters such
 as heart rate and respiration rate and signs of sedation were recorded. The
 limit of detection in plasma samples was achieved after three hours and in
 urine twenty-four hours after dosing for all horses. Afterwards the results
 were integrated into a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic approach of TOUTAIN
 and LASSOURD (2002) to calculate the irrelevant plasma and urine
 concentrations at which romifidine has no effect on the organism anymore. The
 calculation of the effective plasma concentration, the irrelevant plasma
 concentration and irrelevant urine concentration with the
 pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of TOUTAIN and LASSOURD (2002) showed
 that the irrelevant plasma concentration (at 0.05 ng/ml) and urine
 concentration (at 0.24 ng/ml) are far above the limit of detection (dosing
 interval of 2 hours). It is to be concluded that any detection of romifidine
 in plasma or urine has to be considered as a positive result of doping.
 The hypothesis to establish a
 selected cut-off value for therapeutics seems not to be acceptable for
 romifidine. Any detection of romifidine in plasma or urine samples should be
 considered as relevant for doping and should be punished.",2004,

FIRST SESSION: AFTERNOON, MARCH 21; ABSTRACTS 1-10 1. ANATOMY AND FUNCTION OF THE PALATE OF THE ALBINO RAT. Helen Kutuzov and Harry Sicher, Department of Histology, University of Illinois College of Dentistry, and Department of Anatomy and Histology, Loyola University School of Dentistry, Chicago, Ill. The palates of 25 normal albino rats were examined macroscopically and microscopically with special reference to the functional correlation of their structure to that of the tongue. Four distinct regions, each characterized by a different type of dermal and epithelial structures, were identified: (1) the roof of the oral atrium which carries a longitudinal ridge ending posteriorly at the incisal papilla; (2) the antemolar region, anterior to the molars and characterized by three simple transverse high rugae; (3) the intermolar area, located between and slightly posteriorly to the molars, is occupied by five low ridges in the shape of a letter M straightening out posteriorly to a more simple curve; they carry many sharp secondary ridges; and -(4) the postrugal field reaching to the boundary between the hard and soft palate, mainly characterized by innumerable fine papillae. The roof of the oral atrium together with the folding in of the upper and lower lips, and the median sulcus of the tongue form a funnel shaped canal which serves to prevent the entry of not sufficiently comminuted food into the oral cavity proper. The epithelium of the straight rugae contains Merkel's touch cells and, with the underlying portion of the tongue beset with simple conical and fungiform papillae, comprises the discriminatory region of the oral cavity. The sharp secondary ridges of the intermolar area together with the giant papillae of the tongue have an auxiliary masticatory function. The fine papillae of the postrugal field and the filiform papillae of the tongue perform the final screening of the food particles. 2. TOOTH PULP RESPONSE TO OPERATIVE PROCEDURES. Drexell A.

Some of the cavities were deep; others shallow. Six 460 HAMILTON B. G. ROBINSON J. D. Res. August, 1952? of the cavities were left unfilled; the others were filled with either Ca(OH)2 and cement, cement alone, amalgam, or self-curing resins. One week after the treatment the teeth were removed and semiserial histologic sections prepared. The pulps of the teeth showed histologic evidence of injury only if the cavities were unfilled. This is true regardless of whether or not the cavity was deep or shallow, prepared with a bur or airbrasive technique. 3. OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE HISTOGENESIS OF THE EPITHELIAL ATTACHMENT. L. J. Baume, D.M.D., M.S., Division of Dental Medicine, College of Dentistry, University of California, San Francisco, Calif. The development of the epithelial attachment and the formation of a gingival sulcus was studied histologically in the first permanent molars and the incisors of. 20 Rhesus Macaques at consecutive preeruptive and posteruptive stages. Following the formation of the enamel there occurred a reduction of the elements of the stratum intermedium, stellate reticulum and outer enamel epithelium into a syncytium of uniform prickle cells. Their cytoplasm stained only lightly with fuchsin (Masson's stain) while that of the oral epithelium always stained much darker, allowing a clear differentiation, especially under the phase contrast microscope. The prickle cells were connected with the ameloblasts by intercellular bridges containing prominent tonofibrils. Near the surface of the enamel these tonofibrils fused together to form a continuous membrane, which eventually calcified. In the pre-eruptive stage the following processes were observed: (a) Catabolic changes in the enamel organ, (b) Desmolysis of the connective tissue between the oral and enamel epithelium, (c) Fusion of the oral and enamel epithelium. There was a variation in the timing of these events apparently related to the stresses exerted by the horizontal and vertical movements of the erupting tooth: (1) At the sites of eruptive pressure the prickle cells of the enamel epithelium proliferated interstitially and replaced the ameloblasts prior to clinical tooth eruption. At the same time oral epithelium proliferated toward the enamel epithelium, fused with it and grew along the basal layer of the latter. After the tip of the crown had emerged the enamel epithelium began to disintegrate at the points of fusion of the two epithelia. This established a sulcus between remnants of the reduced enamel epithelium and oral epithelium. (2) In the absence of pressure at the opposite side the prickle cells proliferated at their basal side in the presence of intact ameloblasts. Oral epithelium did not fuse immediately with the enamel epithelium, but proliferated first some distance behind it and followed later the pattern described under (1). Studies with the phase contrast microscope show that ",1952,Journal of Dental Research
Papilloma Invertito Uroteliale,"Furono gli australiani POTTS e HIRST nel 1963 i primi a descrivere e a introdurre in letteratura il termine di papilloma invertito benigno della vescica (questo tipo di lesione era gia noto a livello della mucosa nasale e digestiva e della cute): con questo termine si intende una neoplasia verosimilmente benigna a sede prevalente cervico-uretrale, caratterizzata da un aspetto macroscopico polipoide e da una struttura istologica formata da proliferazioni papillari solide e microcistiche che dalla superficie si approfondano nello stroma del connettivo lasso. Per quanto riguarda l'aspetto istogenetico, POTTS e HIRST hanno ipotizzato che questa neoplasia originasse dalle ghiandole sottocervicaIi di ALBARRAN e BRUNN, in quanto hanno osservato delle cavita cistiche contenenti materiale PAS-positivo omogeneo ed eosinofilo. Altri autori (MATZ 1974, SORET 1976, DEMEESTER 1975, CUMMINGS 1974) invece considerano il papilloma invertito non una lesione neoplastica, rna una semplice iperplasia dell'urotelio con formazioni di cripte chiuse dove si raccoglie il materiale mucoso PAS-positivo normalmente presente nelle cellule superficiali dell'epitelio di transizione, come hanno dimostrato MENDE e CHAMBERS.

How do islands become green,"Aim 
 
Four long-distance dispersal (LDD) modes have generally been considered to play central roles in the colonization of islands by plants: anemochory (dispersal by wind), thalassochory (dispersal by oceanic currents), endozoochory (internal dispersal by animals) and epizoochory (external dispersal by animals). However, seeds can also be transported by vectors different from those to which they are best suited (non-standard dispersal), meaning that the actual vector of colonization cannot be inferred based on diaspore traits alone. We propose an alternative approach to explore the relative contribution of LDD syndromes to island colonization. 
 
 
 
Location 
 
Europe and the Azores. 
 
 
 
Methods 
 
We scored the presence of syndromes relevant for LDD in the native flora of Europe (c. 10,000 species) and the Azores (148 species). We then contrasted the importance of each syndrome in the recipient flora (Azores) and the source floras (Europe and mainland Portugal) to estimate which, if any, syndrome was particularly successful for overseas colonization. We further investigated whether particular LDD syndromes increased plant distribution within the Azores archipelago. 
 
 
 
Results 
 
Most native species in Europe (63%), mainland Portugal (67%) and the Azores (63%) produce unspecialized diaspores. Only species adapted to sea dispersal were overrepresented in the Azores, while those adapted to wind dispersal were underrepresented. The presence of LDD syndromes did not significantly improve the distribution of plant species across the archipelago, except for the moderate advantage of endozoochorous diaspores. Differences in the importance of LDD syndromes across plant families at least partially explain the floristic disharmony of the Azorean flora. 
 
 
 
Main conclusions 
 
Only thalassochory appeared to have significantly favoured the colonization of the Azores. The high proportion of unspecialized diaspores, the unexceptional representation of most specialized LDD syndromes and the dissociation between syndromes and inter-island plant distribution in the Azores suggest that non-standard events are more common than previously believed in the colonization of islands by plants.",2015,Global Ecology and Biogeography
Projection algorithms for large scale optimization and genomic data analysis,"The advent of the Big Data era has spawned intense interest in scalable mathematical optimization methods. Traditional approaches such as Newtonâ€™s method fall apart whenever the features outnumber the examples in a data set. Consequently, researchers have intensely developed first-order methods that rely only on gradients and subgradients of a cost function.In this dissertation we focus on projected gradient methods for large-scale con-strained optimization. We develop a particular case of a proximal gradient methodcalled the proximal distance algorithm. Proximal distance algorithms combine theclassical penalty method of constrained minimization with distance majorization. Tooptimize the loss function $f(x)$ over a constraint set $C$, the proximal distance principle mandates minimizing the penalized loss $f(x) + \rho \mathrm{dist} \; (x,C)^2$ and following the solution $x_{\rho}$ to its limit as $\rho \to \infty$. At each iteration the squared Euclidean distance $\mathrm{dist} \; (x, C)^2$ is majorized by $\| x âˆ’ \Pi_{C}(x_k) \|_2^2$, where $\Pi_{C}(x_k)$ denotes the projection of the current iterate $x_k$ onto $C$. The minimum of the surrogate function $f(x) + \rho \| x âˆ’ \Pi_{C} (x_k) \|_2^2$ is given by the proximal map $\mathrm{prox}_{Ï^{âˆ’1}} \; f [ \Pi_{C} (x_k )]$. The next iterate $x_{k+1}$ automatically decreases the original penalized loss for fixed $\rho$. Since many explicit projections and proximal maps are known in analytic or computable form, the proximal distance algorithm provides a scalable computational framework for a variety of constraints.For the particular case of sparse linear regression, we implement a projected gradient algorithm known as iterative hard thresholding for a particular large-scale genomics analysis known as a genome-wide association study. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) correlates marker variation with trait variation in a sample of individuals. Each study subject is genotyped at a multitude of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) spanning the genome. Here we assume that subjects are unrelated and collected at random and that trait values are normally distributed or transformed to normality. Over the past decade, researchers have been remarkably successful in applying GWAS analysis to hundreds of traits. The massive amount of data produced in these studies present unique computational challenges. Penalized regression with LASSO or MCP penalties is capable of selecting a handful of associated SNPs from millions of potential SNPs. Unfortunately, model selection can be corrupted by false positives and false negatives, obscuring the genetic underpinning of a trait. Our parallel implementation of IHT accommodates SNP genotype compression and exploits multiple CPU cores and graphics processing units (GPUs). This allows statistical geneticists to leverage desktop workstations in GWAS analysis and to eschew expensive supercomputing resources. We evaluate IHT performance on both simulated and real GWAS data and conclude that it reduces false positive and false negative rates while remaining competitive in computational time with penalized regression.",2016,
The use of genomic information increases the accuracy of breeding value predictions for sea louse (Caligus rogercresseyi) resistance in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar),"Sea lice infestations caused by Caligus rogercresseyi are a main concern to the salmon farming industry due to associated economic losses. Resistance to this parasite was shown to have low to moderate genetic variation and its genetic architecture was suggested to be polygenic. The aim of this study was to compare accuracies of breeding value predictions obtained with pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (P-BLUP) methodology against different genomic prediction approaches: genomic BLUP (G-BLUP), Bayesian Lasso, and Bayes C. To achieve this, 2404 individuals from 118 families were measured for C. rogercresseyi count after a challenge and genotyped using 37Â K single nucleotide polymorphisms. Accuracies were assessed using fivefold cross-validation and SNP densities of 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25 and 37Â K. Accuracy of genomic predictions increased with increasing SNP density and was higher than pedigree-based BLUP predictions by up to 22%. Both Bayesian and G-BLUP methods can predict breeding values with higher accuracies than pedigree-based BLUP, however, G-BLUP may be the preferred method because of reduced computation time and ease of implementation. A relatively low marker density (i.e. 10Â K) is sufficient for maximal increase in accuracy when using G-BLUP or Bayesian methods for genomic prediction of C. rogercresseyi resistance in Atlantic salmon.",2017,"Genetics, Selection, Evolution : GSE"

Redox-active tyrosine residue in the microcin J25 molecule.,"Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is a 21 amino acid lasso-peptide antibiotic produced by Escherichia coli and composed of an 8-residues ring and a terminal 'tail' passing through the ring. We have previously reported two cellular targets for this antibiotic, bacterial RNA polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain, and shown that Tyr9 is essential for the effect on the membrane respiratory chain which leads to superoxide overproduction. In the present paper we investigated the redox behavior of MccJ25 and the mutant MccJ25 (Y9F). Cyclic voltammetry measurements showed irreversible oxidation of both Tyr9 and Tyr20 in MccJ25, but infrared spectroscopy studies demonstrated that only Tyr9 could be deprotonated upon chemical oxidation in solution. Formation of a long-lived tyrosyl radical in the native MccJ25 oxidized by Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚ was demonstrated by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; this radical was not detected when the reaction was carried out with the MccJ25 (Y9F) mutant. These results show that the essential Tyr9, but not Tyr20, can be easily oxidized and form a tyrosyl radical.",2011,Biochemical and biophysical research communications
"Structured sparsity: theorems, algorithms and applications","Today, sparsity techniques have been widely used to address practical problems in the fields of medical imaging, machine learning, computer vision, data mining, compressive sensing, image processing, video analysis and multimedia. We will briefly introduce the related sparsity techniques and their successful applications on compressive sensing, sparse learning, computer vision and medical imaging. Then, we propose a new concept called strong group sparsity to develop a theory for group Lasso, which shows that group Lasso is superior to standard Lasso for strongly group-sparse data. It provides a convincing theoretical justification for using group sparsity regularization when the underlying group structure is consistent with the data. Moreover, the theory also predicts the limitations of the group Lasso formulations. To address those limitations, we further build a new framework called structured sparsity, which is a natural extension of the standard sparsity concept in statistical learning and compressive sensing. By allowing arbitrary structures on the feature set or data, this concept generalizes the group sparsity idea. A general theory (Group-RIP) is developed for learning with structured sparsity, based on the notion of coding complexity associated with the structure, which guarantees better performance with more structure information other than pure sparsity. The new sparsity techniques under this framework have been successfully applied to different applications, such as compressive sensing MR imaging, video background subtraction, object tracking in visual surveillance, dynamic scene registration, automatic image annotation, medical image analysis, fast tag separation in cardiac tMRIs, cervigram image segmentation and so on. The improved experimental results in these applications further validate the nice theoretical guarantees of our new theorems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new framework in the practical applications involved large scale data.",2011,
OxfordÅ¡tÃ­ PliosauÅ™i SevernÃ­ Tethydy V Kontextu Fylogeneze Kladu Thalassophonea,"Apparent differences between the faunal compositions of Callovian (late Middle Jurassic) and Kimmeridgianâ€“ Tithonian (middle to late Late Jurassic) marine diapsids of Europe suggest that a faunal turnover occurred during the Oxfordian (early Late Jurassic). The differences in the structures of marine diapsids are usually discussed within the context of the sub-Boreal realm. However, the knowledge of fossil faunas from the Oxfordian of adjacent areas that at least shortly communicated with the northern European marine ecosystems, such as the northern Tethyan realm, is crucial for inferences of diapsid migration patterns and faunal replacements in general. Here we provide an initial insight into the marine diapsids of northern Tethyan areas. Specifically, we describe two incomplete specimens of pliosaurid tooth crowns from the middle or upper Oxfordian of Stranska skala, Czech Republic, comment on their biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental settings, and compare them to the crowns of other Middle and Late Jurassic pliosaurid taxa. The morphology of the specimens, including the subcircular cross-sectional shapes, and the appearance and distribution of the apicobasal ridges resemble the tooth crowns of the Callovian thalassophonean Liopleurodon ferox. Nevertheless, due to the fragmentary nature of the finds, unambiguous attribution to the macropredatory taxon is impossible. Still, the material supplements our knowledge of the paleobiogeographic distribution of the early Late Jurassic thalassophonean pliosaurids.",2018,

Structured Iterative Hard Thresholding for Categorical and Mixed Data Types,"In many applications, data exists in a mixed data type format, i.e. a combination of nominal (categorical) and numericalal features. A common practice for working with categorical features is to use an encoding method to transform the discrete values into numeric representation. However, numeric representation often neglects the innate structures in categorical features, potentially degrading the performance of learning algorithms. Utilizing the numeric representation could also limit interpretation of the learned model, such as finding the most discriminative categorical features or filtering irrelevant attributes. In this work, we extend the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm to quantify the structure of categorical features. The empirical evaluation of the proposed structured hard thresholding algorithm is based on both real and synthetic data sets in comparison with the original hard thresholding algorithm, LASSO and Random Forest. The results demonstrate an improved performance over the original IHT.",2019,2019 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)

An Efficient Approach to Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis,"We present a novel approach to the formulation and the resolution of sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Our proposal, is based on penalized Optimal Scoring. It has an exact equivalence with penalized LDA, contrary to the multi-class approaches based on the regression of class indicator that have been proposed so far. Sparsity is obtained thanks to a group-Lasso penalty that selects the same features in all discriminant directions. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach generates extremely parsimonious models without compromising prediction performances. Besides prediction, the resulting sparse discriminant directions are also amenable to low-dimensional representations of data. Our algorithm is highly efficient for medium to large number of variables, and is thus particularly well suited to the analysis of gene expression data.",2012,
Practical Compressed Sensing: Modern data acquisition and signal processing,"Since 2004, the field of compressed sensing has grown quickly and seen tremendous interest because it provides a theoretically sound and computationally tractable method to stably recover signals by sampling at the information rate. This thesis presents in detail the design of one of the world's first compressed sensing hardware devices, the random modulation pre-integrator (RMPI). The RMPI is an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that bypasses a current limitation in ADC technology and achieves an unprecedented 8 effective number of bits over a bandwidth of 2.5 GHz. Subtle but important design considerations are discussed, and state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques are presented. Inspired by the need for a fast method to solve reconstruction problems for the RMPI, we develop two efficient large-scale optimization methods, NESTA and TFOCS, that are applicable to a wide range of other problems, such as image denoising and deblurring, MRI reconstruction, and matrix completion (including the famous Netflix problem). While many algorithms solve unconstrained l1 problems, NESTA and TFOCS can solve the constrained form of l1 minimization, and allow weighted norms. In addition to l1 minimization problems such as the LASSO, both NESTA and TFOCS solve total-variation minimization problem. TFOCS also solves the Dantzig selector and most variants of the nuclear norm minimization problem. A common theme in both NESTA and TFOCS is the use of smoothing techniques, which make the problem tractable, and the use of optimal first-order methods that have an accelerated convergence rate yet have the same cost per iteration as gradient descent. The conic dual methodology is introduced in TFOCS and proves to be extremely flexible, covering such generic problems as linear programming, quadratic programming, and semi-definite programming. A novel continuation scheme is presented, and it is shown that the Dantzig selector benefits from an exact-penalty property. Both NESTA and TFOCS are released as software packages available freely for academic use.",2011,
Thermodynamics and radiation of a collapsing shell in Schwarzschild-De Sitter universe,"SummaryWe study the radiation emitted by a collapsing, spherical, neutral, nonrotating, thin shell of matter in the Schwarzschild-De Sitter space-time. It is found a black-body spectrum characterized by an effective temperature which is a function of the cosmological constant and the shell mass. This temperature is related to the one measured by a static observer. In particular, we discuss the interplay between the incipient black-hole emission and the Rindler effect. Finally it results that the cosmological background radiation does not affect appreciably the emission by the collapsing shell.RiassuntoSi studia la radiazione emessa durante il collasso da uno strato sferico, neutro, non rotante di materia nello spazio-tempo di Schwarzschild-De Sitter. Si trova uno spettro da corpo nero caratterizzato da una temperature effettiva, funzione della costante cosmologica e della massa dello strato. Questa temperatura Ã¨ messa in relazione con quella misurata da un osservatore statico. In particolare, si discute l'interrelazione tra l'emissione dal buco nero incipeiente e l'effetto Rindler. Infine risulta che il fondo di radiazione cosmologica non altera apprezzabilmente l'emissione dallo strato in collasso.Ð ÐµÐ·ÑŽÐ¼ÐµÐœÑ‹ Ð¸ÑÑÐ»ÐµÐ´ÑƒÐµÐ¼ Ð¸Ð·Ð»ÑƒÑ‡ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ, Ð¸ÑÐ¿ÑƒÑÐºÐ°ÐµÐ¼Ð¾Ðµ ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð»Ð°Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ñ€ÑƒÑŽÑ‰ÐµÐ¹, ÑÑ„ÐµÑ€Ð¸Ñ‡ÐµÑÐºÐ¾Ð¹, Ð½ÐµÐ¹Ñ‚Ñ€Ð°Ð»ÑŒÐ½Ð¾Ð¹, Ð½Ðµ Ð²Ñ€Ð°Ñ‰Ð°ÑŽÑ‰ÐµÐ¹ÑÑ, Ñ‚Ð¾Ð½ÐºÐ¾Ð¹ Ð¾Ð±Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ñ‡ÐºÐ¾Ð¹ Ð²ÐµÑ‰ÐµÑÑ‚Ð²Ð° Ð² Ð¿Ñ€Ð¾ÑÑ‚Ñ€Ð°Ð½ÑÑ‚Ð²ÐµÐ²Ñ€ÐµÐ¼ÐµÐ½Ð¸ Ð¨Ð²Ð°Ñ€Ñ†ÑˆÐ¸Ð»ÑŒÐ´Ð°-Ð´Ðµ Ð¡Ð¸Ñ‚Ñ‚ÐµÑ€Ð°.

ColoGuidePro: a prognostic 7-gene expression signature for stage III colorectal cancer patients.,"PURPOSE
Improved prognostic stratification of patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer is warranted for postoperative clinical decision making. This study was conducted to develop a clinically feasible and robust prognostic classifier for these patients independent of adjuvant treatment.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Global gene expression profiles from altogether 387 stage II and III colorectal cancer tissue samples from three independent patient series were included in the study. ColoGuidePro, a seven-gene prognostic classifier, was developed from a selected Norwegian learning series (n = 95; no adjuvant treatment) using lasso-penalized multivariate survival modeling with cross-validation.


RESULTS
The expression signature significantly stratified patients in a consecutive Norwegian test series, in which patients were treated according to current standards [HR, 2.9 (1.1-7.5); P = 0.03; n = 77] and an external validation series [HR, 3.7 (2.0-6.8); P < 0.001; n = 215] according to survival. ColoGuidePro was also an independent predictor of prognosis in multivariate models including tumor stage in both series (HR, â‰¥ 3.1; P â‰¤ 0.03). In the validation series, which consisted of patients from other populations (United States and Australia), 5-year relapse-free survival was significantly predicted for stage III patients only (P < 0.001; n = 107). Here, prognostic stratification was independent of adjuvant treatment (P = 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
We present ColoGuidePro, a prognostic classifier developed for patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer. The test is suitable for transfer to clinical use and has best prognostic prediction potential for stage III patients.",2012,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research
Procjena stupnja anemije u bolesnika nakon zamjene srÄanih zalistaka i aortokoronarnog premoÅ¡tenja The estimation of anemia degree in patients after heart valve replacement and coronary artery bypass surgery,"SaÅ¾etak. Cilj: Utvrditi prisutnost, vrstu i stupanj anemije u bolesnika nakon operacije zamjene srcanih zalistaka i aortokoronarnog premostenja tijekom prva tri tjedna rane stacionarne medicinske rehabilitacije. Ispitanici i postupci: Podaci su dobiveni analizom medicinske dokumentacije na temelju odobrenja Etickog povjerenstva Specijalne bolnice za medicinsku rehabilitaciju bolesti srca, pluca i reumatizma â€žThalassotherapia â€“ Opatijaâ€ iz Opatije u skladu sa svim primjenjivim smjernicama Osnova dobre klinicke prakse i Helsinske deklaracije. IstraÅ¾ivanje je obuhvatilo 145 bolesnika s aortokoronarnim premostenjem i 67 bolesnika sa zamijenjenim srcanim zaliskom. Obje skupine podijeljene su na skupinu muskaraca i Å¾ena, a rezultati usporeÄ‘ivani sa zdravim ispitanicima koristenjem neparametrijskih testova Kruskal-Wallis i Mann-Whitneyjeva U-testa. Rezultati: U skupini Å¾ena i muskaraca nakon operacije zamjene sr canih zalistaka i nakon ucinjenog aortokoronarnog premostenja broj eritrocita, koncentracija hemoglobina i hematokrit statisticki su znacajno sniÅ¾eni (sva tri P < 0,001) u odnosu na skupinu zdravih ispitanika, no nismo utvrdili znacajnu razliku u hematoloskim indeksima izmeÄ‘u navedenih skupina. Rasprava: U ispitivanih bolesnika postoje promjene u eritrogramu u smislu smanjenja broja normokromnih i normocitnih eritrocita, iako promjene nisu dostatne za proglasenje anemije. Zbog poznate povecane stope smrtnosti od anemije u srcanih bolesnika potrebno je tragati za razvojem anemije, procjenjivati stupanj i odrediti njezin uzrok, s ciljem pravovremenog i odgovarajuceg lijecenja.

Statistical Treatment of Trace Element Data from Modern and Ancient Animal Bone: Evaluation of Roman and Byzantine Environmental Pollution,"Abstract Through chemical analysis of ancient animal bone found at the archaeological site of Sagalassos, and through comparison of the analytical data with that from modern bone and feed from the same location, conclusions on the ancient livestock are made. Samples of ancient and modern goat bone as well as Quercus coccifera were analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasmaâ€“Mass Spectrometry (ICPâ€MS). After evaluation of the consistency of the chemical characteristics of different types of modern bone in one individual, it is decided to use the trace element data of long bone for statistical treatment. After evaluation of the degree and effects of diagenesis in the fossil bone, it is concluded that trace element data are useful indicators for anthropogenic palaeoenvironmental pollution, as a distinction could be made between elements that occur naturally in the bedrock and those that can be linked to industrial pollution. The occurrence or depletion of the latter elements in fossil bone, show diachronic cha...",2004,Analytical Letters
LASSOO: a generalized directed diversity approach to the design and enrichment of chemical libraries.,"Pharmaceutical discovery relies on the screening of chemical libraries that are as diverse as possible yet constrained in favor of compounds possessing attributes that are normally associated with successful drug candidates. We describe a new algorithm for simultaneously addressing both objectives, providing an effective means to increase structural diversity in a chemical library while maintaining a bias toward compounds that retain the desirable properties of drugs. The LASSOO algorithm exploits differences in descriptor distributions to identify novel compounds that are most dissimilar to the members of an existing screening library and most similar to members of a target library with desirable characteristics. We illustrate the LASSOO technique using publicly available compound databases and bit string descriptors. The architecture of the algorithm is general enough to allow any set of descriptors or similarity measures to be employed, and it is easily adaptable to other means of directing diversity, such as the avoidance of toxicity and/or poor pharmacokinetic properties.",1999,Journal of medicinal chemistry
Tratamento da mÃ¡ oclusÃ£o de Classe II com distalizador First Class em ancoragem convencional e esquelÃ©tica: relato de caso,"Os distalizadores intrabucais, como o First Class, podem ser utilizados para o tratamento de pacientes com ma oclusao de Classe II dentaria.

O objetivo deste artigo foi apresentar o tratamento da ma oclusao de Classe II dentaria com o distalizador First Class associado a ancoragem convencional e esqueletica e descrever os efeitos em cada tipo de ancoragem. Dois casos clinicos foram ilustrados. As alteracoes dentoesqueleticas foram avaliadas por meio de telerradiografias. O caso tratado com a ancoragem esqueletica mostrou menor angulacao dos primeiros molares do que a convencional, indicando maior movimento de corpo. O aparelho First Class promoveu eficiente distalizacao do molar, entretanto, houve perda de ancoragem mesmo quando utilizada ancoragem esqueletica, embora tenha apresentado menores efeitos colaterais do que a ancoragem convencional. Sao necessarios estudos para maior compreensao dos efeitos da biomecÃ¢nica com mini-implantes associados aos distalizadores intrabucais.(AU) Intrabucal distalizer, such as the oFirst Classo, can be used to orthodontic treatment of patients with dentoalveolar Class II malocclusion. However they often present undesirable side effects such as anchorage loss, due to the use of palate and premolars as anchorage for distalization. The solution to this obstacle has been provided by skeletal anchorage with mini-implants. The aim of this article was to present the treatment of dentoalveolar Class II malocclusion with First Class distalizer associated with conventional and skeletal anchorage and describe the clinical effects of each type of anchorage. Two case reports were illustrated. The dentoskeletal alterations were assessed by means of lateral cephalometric radiographs. Skeletal anchorage showed lower tipping than conventional anchorage indicating predominantly bodily movement. First Class appliance offered reliable molar distalization, however there was anchorage loss even when skeletal anchorage was used, although skeletal anchorage showed less side effects than conventional anchorage. Further works are required to elucidate the effects of biomechanics with mini-implants associated with the intraoral distalizers.",2012,
The 1â€year Renal Biopsy Index: a scoring system to drive biopsy indication at 1â€year postâ€kidney transplantation,"Surveillance biopsies after renal transplantation remain debatable. To drive the decision of such intervention, we propose a predictive score of abnormal histology at 1-year post-transplantation, named 1-year Renal Biopsy Index (1-RBI). We studied 466 kidney recipients from the DIVAT cohort alive with a functioning graft and a surveillance biopsy at 1-year post-transplantation. Patients displaying abnormal histology (49%) (borderline, acute rejection, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy [IFTA] grade 2 or 3, glomerulonephritis) were compared to the normal or subnormal (IFTA grade 1) histology group. Obtained from a lasso penalized logistic regression, the 1-RBI was composed of recipient gender, serum creatinine at 3, 6, and 12 month post-transplantation and anticlass II immunization at transplantation (internal validation: AUC = 0.71, 95% CI [0.53-0.83]; external validation: AUC = 0.62, 95% CI [0.58-0.66]). While we could not determinate a threshold able to identify patients at high chance of normal or subnormal histology, we estimated and validated a discriminating threshold capable of identifying a subgroup of 15% of the patients with a risk of abnormal histology higher than 80%. The 1-RBI is computable online at www.divat.fr. The 1-RBI could be a useful tool to standardize 1-year biopsy proposal and may for instance help to indicate one in case of high risk of abnormal histology.",2018,Transplant International
Introduzione di un â€œLearning Management Systemâ€ nellâ€™attivitÃ  di matematica della scuola media,"Il Blended Learning consiste nellâ€™integrazione dellâ€™attivita di classe tradizionale con attivita svolte individualmente (spesso a distanza) attraverso un sistema computerizzato e in questi ultimi anni ha conosciuto una forte espansione, soprattutto nella formazione aziendale e di grado superiore. 
La ricerca in questo campo ha prodotto risultati interessanti, benche ancora tuttâ€™altro che stabili, indicando nel contempo quanto ancora poco sia stato investigato lâ€™ambito dellâ€™educazione secondaria (K-12). Il presente lavoro descrive lâ€™esperienza fatta in una classe di seconda media in cui una parte dellâ€™attivita, anziche essere svolta in aula, e stata trasferiti su un sistema computerizzato (Learning Management System o â€œLMSâ€). I punteggi che gli allievi hanno ottenuto nelle verifiche, sono stati confrontati con quelli ottenuti da un gruppo di controllo cui era stato proposto materiale identico nello stesso lasso di tempo, ma in modo totalmente tradizionale (faccia a faccia in situazione dâ€™aula).

La cultura igienista applicata alla cittÃ  : il caso dei bagni e lavatoi pubblici a Torino,"INTRODUZIONE AL TEMA 
1.1 Premessa 
La tesi si propone di affrontare un tema che durante il corso di studi mi ha colpita e interessato molto, ovvero la trasformazione della citta o meglio dell'idea di citta che risale alla fine dell'Ottocento, in particolare in relazione a quelle che sono le teorie che nascono in Europa di quello che e il movimento conosciuto con il nome di igienismo. Ed e proprio sulla fine del XIX secolo che iniziano a germogliare i concetti, oggetto ancora oggi di dibattito che caratterizzano la citta contemporanea. 
La curiosita nell'approfondire questa precisa tematica deriva oltre dal corso di storia dell'architettura e della citta, anche da un'esperienza avuta nel corso di un atelier di restauro, il cui tema era il recupero e la valorizzazione dei bagni pubblici siti in via Roccavione 11 a Torino. Infatti l'approccio con questa inusuale categoria di manufatti architettonici e stato un modo per comprendere come le teorie igieniste effettivamente potessero trovare applicazione e quanto questi edifici siano stati fondamentali e di supporto non solo in Italia, ma in tutta Europa alla popolazione, specialmente quella piu disagiata, che si riversava nelle nuove citta industriali di fine Ottocento. 
La citta dell'Ottocento e, infatti, una citta che si evolve continuamente, travolta dal clima positivista e dal fervore del progresso industriale, che non tiene pero conto che una tale rapidita di pensiero non e poi seguita da altrettanta velocita di azione e di organizzazione del territorio. La maggior parte delle citta italiane e straniere non sono, infatti, pronte a livello infrastrutturale ad accogliere la massa di popolazione che sopraggiunge dalle campagne in cerca di lavoro nelle industrie, che finisce dunque per essere stipata nelle periferie che man mano si espandono sempre di piu, causando e favorendo l'insorgere di epidemie come tifo e colera. 
L'Ottocento e considerato un secolo lungo1 che, secondo una ""lettera storiografica"" dei periodi, porta con se tutte le tematiche nate e sviluppate a partire dal 1789 con la Rivoluzione Francese, sino ad andare oltre al 1899 e arrivare, nel 1914, al primo conflitto mondiale. In questo grande lasso di tempo si susseguono avvenimenti, invenzioni e si muovono personaggi che determineranno un'eredita di realta, concetti e valori che getteranno le basi per l'avvio del nuovo secolo. 
Le idee principali alla base dell'organizzazione delle infrastrutture igienico-sanitarie vedono il loro affermarsi proprio a Torino soltanto dopo un insieme di avvenimenti storici che porteranno allo sviluppo di nuove soluzioni scientifiche e tecnologiche in questo campo. Durante l'epoca napoleonica, dopo i primi periodi di conflitto, durante i quali la questione strategica era stata determinante per l'assetto morfologico delle citta e le mura difensive avevano in qualche modo bloccato i piani e i progetti delle espansione delle stesse, si inizio ad attuare la ""politica di livellamento"" delle fortificazioni2; questa pratica consentiva maggiore controllo sui territori dell' Impero e permetteva allo stesso tempo innumerevoli risvolti concreti per gli sviluppi del tessuto delle citta. Le opere principali erano essenzialmente interventi di sterro e riporto in prossimita delle porte. Un decreto di Napoleone del 1804 decideva il definitivo stato di disarmo e contemplava la vendita di parte dei terreni su cui sorgevano le fortificazioni e le piazzeforti. Questo provvedimento puo essere considerato a pieno titolo il punto di partenza per lo sviluppo ottocentesco delle citta. In termini igienico sanitari, oltre alle prescrizione in campo militare, il primo atto normativo e rappresentato dal Regolamento Napoleonico, promulgato nel 1806 e riguardante l'istituzione della ""Polizia medica"" del Regno, che si occupava di far rispettare le nome in materia protoigienico-sanitaria contenute all'interno del regolamento stesso. 
Di notevole importanza furono anche le norme che vietavano la pratica del seppellimento dei cadaveri al di fuori delle aree stabilite, come cimiteri: il fine principale di queste norme era di limitare l'intacco della falda acquifera, condizione che, in caso di pestilenze, poteva portare alla diffusione di epidemie, che avrebbero potuto colpire la popolazione su vasta scala. 
A partire dall'anno 1848 emersero condizioni che portarono nel tempo alla trasformazione del concetto di ""igiene pubblica"" non piu associato al decoro e all'immagine della citta, ma finalizzato alla salute pubblica e collegato direttamente alle scoperte scientifiche che incalzavano in quel tempo3. Il movimento igienista contribui in modo sostanziale a formare una coscienza collettiva che non trascurasse le tematiche medico-scientifiche affiancate alla risoluzione dei problemi di salubrita, ma che, al contrario, fosse sempre piu incentivata a servirsi delle nuove scoperte al fine di evitare il sorgere delle allora frequenti emergenze sanitarie. 
Dunque, spinti clima positivista dell'epoca, fiduciosi nel progresso e nel futuro, gli intellettuali ma non solo anche ingegneri, politici, medici e altre figure erudite iniziano a comprendere, grazie anche alle scoperte in campo medico-scientifico che la vita nelle citta per come erano concepite all'epoca dovesse cambiare. L'igiene si prefigura come una disciplina carica di risvolti sociali; parallelamente agli obiettivi di tipo teorici, che essa si pone, vi e non solo la sconfitta delle malattie infettive, ma anche l'introduzione di una nuova coscienza collettiva, basata su precetti del tutto nuovi rispetto al passato. 
La tesi dunque si propone di affrontare il tema legato al movimento igienista tramite la sua applicazione ad una serie di manufatti architettonici, ovvero i bagni e lavatoi pubblici, in particolare si fa riferimento al complesso dei Bagni Pubblici di via Roccavione 11, il cui studio e rilievo mi ha dato cosi modo di approfondire alcuni degli aspetti di un' ideologia che ha contribuito sostanzialmente a modificare la struttura e l'organizzazione della citta non solo italiane, ma anche straniere. 
L'iter seguito quindi per la redazione della tesi non e stato quello solito della conoscenza finalizzata alla progettazione, ma in questo caso si e voluto partire dall'elaborazione di un progetto (che era comunque frutto di un'elaborazione ragionata sulle analisi svolte a diversi livelli e su diversi campi) e andare a ritroso cercando di cogliere la maggior parte degli aspetti che hanno caratterizzato la politica igienista, sia in modo generale che particolare, ovvero legata ai complessi finalizzati alla pulizia e Igiene dei cittadini.",2015,
Comparing Performance of Text Pre-processing Methods for Predicting A Binary Position by LASSO,"This work aims at comparing different methods of preparing textual inputs for LASSO logistic regression to predict a binary position with the textual data extracted from a public consultation of the European Commission. Texts are pre-processed and then input into LASSO to explain the stakeholderâ€™s position, and the mean squared errors are computed to compare different methods. In short, we do not find a clearcut winner. On average, tf-idf performs better than counts of distinct terms, and deleting terms that appear only once reduces the prediction errors.",2018,
HartnÃ¤ckige Mythen zum Thema BPS â€“ und was davon wirklich stimmt!,"ZusammenfassungHintergrundDas benigne Prostatasyndrom (BPS) ist die vierthÃ¤ufigste und fÃ¼nfteuerste Erkrankung von MÃ¤nnern â‰¥50Â Jahre. Obwohl die meisten Urologen zahlreiche Patienten mit BPS behandeln und evidenzbasierte Leitlinien zur Diagnostik und Therapie des BPS vorliegen, halten sich noch zahlreiche Mythen hartnÃ¤ckig in der Urologie, insbesondere zur Pathophysiologie.Ziel der ArbeitNennung gÃ¤ngiger BPS-Mythen und Darstellung der korrekten Terminologie sowie evidenzbasierten Pathophysiologie.Material und MethodenKritische Betrachtung von 12 ausgewÃ¤hlten BPS-Mythen und Darstellung der korrekten Terminologie sowie Pathophysiologie anhand einer Literaturrecherche (PubMed).ErgebnisseDas durchschnittliche Prostatagewicht eines jungen, gesunden, erwachsenen Mannes betrÃ¤gt zwar 20â€¯g, variiert aber zwischen 8 und 40â€¯g. Das BPS verlÃ¤uft nicht in Stadien, weshalb die Stadieneinteilungen nach Alken oder Vahlensieck nicht mehr verwendet werden sollten. Es besteht keine feste Beziehung zwischen Blasenauslassobstruktion (BOO) und ProstatagrÃ¶ÃŸe, Divertikel/Pseudodivertikel, Restharn, Harnwegsinfektionen, Harnverhalt oder NierenfunktionsstÃ¶rung. Die Urethro-Zystoskopie eignet sich nicht zur BOO-Diagnostik. Kein BPS-Medikament kann die BOO relevant reduzieren. Es bestehen keine stichhaltigen Beweise, dass die Prostataresektion vollstÃ¤ndig bis zur chirurgischen Kapsel erfolgen muss.DiskussionDie Ursachen fÃ¼r die hartnÃ¤ckige Verwendung Ã¼berholter Begriffe, alter oder falscher Terminologie sowie falscher pathophysiologischer ZusammenhÃ¤nge beim BPS sind vielfÃ¤ltig. Ein Grund ist die mangelnde Umsetzung evidenzbasierter Inhalte von Leitlinien bedingt durch mangelndes Wissen, individuelle Ãœberzeugungen, Kosten, VerfÃ¼gbarkeit und Erstattungspolitik. Ein weiterer Grund ist die zunehmende Fokussierung der Urologie auf onkologische Themen verbunden mit einer unterreprÃ¤sentierten Aus- und Weiterbildung zum Thema BPS.AbstractBackgroundLower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH) is the fourth most common and the fifth most costly disease in men aged 50Â years or older. Despite the high prevalence of LUTS/BPH in clinical practice and evidence-based guideline recommendations, there are still plenty of misconceptions on the terminology and pathophysiology of the disease, leading to false assumptions and malpractice.ObjectivesListing of commonly used false assumptions and clarification of the correct terminology and pathophysiology.Materials and MethodsCritical reflection of 12 selected fake news based on PubMed search.ResultsAverage prostate weight in healthy men is 20â€¯g but varies between 8â€“40â€¯g. The BPH-disease does not progress in stages; therefore, the BPH-classifications according Alken or Vahlensieck should not be used anymore. There is only aÂ weak and inconsistent relationship between bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and prostate size, diverticula/pseudo-diverticula, postvoid residual, urinary retention or renal insufficiency, which is too unreliable for BOO-diagnosis in the individual patient. Urethro-cystoscopy with grading of the degrees of occlusion of the prostatic urethra and bladder trabeculation is insufficient for BOO-diagnosis. There is no clinically relevant reduction of BOO with licensed BPH-drugs and no convincing data that prostate resection (TURP) has to be complete until the surgical capsule in order to obtain optimal results.ConclusionsThe reasons for the persistent use of wrong terminology and pathophysiology are diverse. One reason is lack of implementation of evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice due to lack of knowledge, individual beliefs, costs, availability and reimbursement policies. Another reason is the increasing focus on oncology, coupled with underrepresented education and training on BPH.",2019,Der Urologe
Sicurezza nei cantieri post-sisma e prevenzione cadute dall'alto,"Si considerano i rischi presenti nei cantieri della ricostruzione delle aree colpite dal sisma dellâ€™Emilia del 2012. Il rischio dovuto a crolli improvvisi e a cadute dallâ€™alto a causa di eventuali scosse sismiche, anche di assestamento, e considerato dal punto di vista della sicurezza degli operatori di cantiere. La strategia proposta per la mitigazione dei rischi per la sicurezza dei lavoratori e basata sulla pianificazione dellâ€™emergenza e sulla programmazione delle fasi di cantiere. Il metodo di programmazione proposto e quello dei diagrammi tempo/spazio, integrato con la contestuale definizione dei rischi con il metodo del Risk Mapping. Il programma operativo delle opere che ne deriva, quale ad esempio il programma delle demolizioni, consente di definire per le aree di lavoro i fondamentali rischi presenti in ogni fase costruttiva, come ad esempio quello dei collasso intempestivo e quello di caduta dallâ€™alto, e permette quindi la tempestiva azione preventiva e protettiva.",2013,
Sparse Causal Network Estimation with Experimental Intervention,"Causal Bayesian networks are graphically represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Learning causal Bayesian networks from data is a challenging problem due to the size of the space of DAGs, the acyclic constraint placed on the graphical structures and the presence of equivalence classes. Most existing methods for learning Bayesian networks are either constraint-based or score-based. In this dissertation, we develop new techniques for learning sparse causal Bayesian networks via regularization.In the first part of the dissertation, we develop an L1-penalized likelihood approach with the adaptive lasso penalty to estimate the structure of causal Gaussian networks. An efficient blockwise coordinate descent algorithm, which takes advantage of the acyclic constraint, is proposed for seeking a local maximizer of the penalized likelihood. We establish that model selection consistency for causal network structures can be achieved with the adaptive lasso penalty and sufficient experimental interventions. Simulations are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In particular, our method shows satisfactory performance for DAGs with 200 nodes which have about 20,000 free parameters.In the second part, we perform a principled generalization of the methodology developed for Gaussian variables to discrete data types by replacing the linear model with the multi-logit model. The adaptive group lasso penalty is utilized that encourages sparsity pattern at the factor level. Another blockwise coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to solve the corresponding optimization problem and asymptotic theory parallel to the one developed for Gaussian Bayesian networks is established.Finally, we illustrate a real-world application of our penalized likelihood framework using a flow cytometry data set generated from a signaling network in human immune system cells.",2012,
High SNR Consistent Compressive Sensing Without Signal and Noise Statistics,"Recovering the support of sparse vectors in underdetermined linear regression models, \textit{aka}, compressive sensing is important in many signal processing applications. High SNR consistency (HSC), i.e., the ability of a support recovery technique to correctly identify the support with increasing signal to noise ratio (SNR) is an increasingly popular criterion to qualify the high SNR optimality of support recovery techniques. The HSC results available in literature for support recovery techniques applicable to underdetermined linear regression models like least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) etc. assume \textit{a priori} knowledge of noise variance or signal sparsity. However, both these parameters are unavailable in most practical applications. Further, it is extremely difficult to estimate noise variance or signal sparsity in underdetermined regression models. This limits the utility of existing HSC results. In this article, we propose two techniques, \textit{viz.}, residual ratio minimization (RRM) and residual ratio thresholding with adaptation (RRTA) to operate OMP algorithm without the \textit{a priroi} knowledge of noise variance and signal sparsity and establish their HSC analytically and numerically. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first and only noise statistics oblivious algorithms to report HSC in underdetermined regression models.",2020,ArXiv

The project additionally sought to explore opportunities for improving repository discovery through interactions between text-mined keywords and on-line thesauri, specifically the HILT tools. 
 
MERLIN used the London Universities aggregation service, LASSO, to demonstrate term extraction and thesaurus integration with full text repository content. A user interface was developed to support the extended functionality. Formative evaluation, user testing and final evaluation all preceded the release of an open source, re-usable web application, to allow the MERLIN metadata enrichment technology to be incorporated into any repository on any platform.",2011,
Termination Analysis by Learning Terminating Programs,"We present a novel approach to termination analysis. In a first step, the analysis uses a program as a black-box which exhibits only a finite set of sample traces. Each sample trace is infinite but can be represented by a finite lasso. The analysis can ""learn"" a program from a termination proof for the lasso, a program that is terminating by construction. In a second step, the analysis checks that the set of sample traces is representative in a sense that we can make formal. An experimental evaluation indicates that the approach is a potentially useful addition to the portfolio of existing approaches to termination analysis.",2014,
Exact Hybrid Covariance Thresholding for Joint Graphical Lasso,"This paper studies precision matrix estimation for multiple related Gaussian graphical models from a dataset consisting of different classes, based upon the formulation of this problem as group graphical lasso. In particular, this paper proposes a novel hybrid covariance thresholding algorithm that can effectively identify zero entries in the precision matrices and split a large joint graphical lasso problem into many small subproblems. Our hybrid covariance thresholding method is superior to existing uniform thresholding methods in that our method can split the precision matrix of each individual class using different partition schemes and thus, split group graphical lasso into much smaller subproblems, each of which can be solved very fast. This paper also establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for our hybrid covariance thresholding algorithm. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data validate the superior performance of our thresholding method over the others.",2015,ArXiv
"Oleibacter marinus gen. nov., sp. nov., a bacterium that degrades petroleum aliphatic hydrocarbons in a tropical marine environment.","Three Gram-negative, motile, mesophilic, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterial strains, designated 2O1(T), 1O14 and 1O18, were isolated from Indonesian seawater after enrichment with crude oil and a continuous supply of supplemented seawater. The strains exhibited high n-alkane-degrading activity, which indicated that the strains were important degraders of petroleum aliphatic hydrocarbons in tropical marine environments. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences of members of the Gammaproteobacteria showed that the isolates formed a coherent and distinct cluster in a stable lineage containing Oceanobacter kriegii IFO 15467(T) (96.4-96.5â€Š% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Thalassolituus oleivorans MIL-1(T). DNA G +C content was 53.0-53.1 mol%. The major fatty acids were C(16â€Š:â€Š0), C(16â€Š:â€Š1)Ï‰7 and C(18â€Š:â€Š1)Ï‰9 and the hydroxy fatty acids were C(12â€Š:â€Š0) 3-OH and C(10â€Š:â€Š0) 3-OH. The polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, a ninhydrin-positive phospholipid(s) and glycolipids. The major quinone was Q-9 (97-99â€Š%), which distinguished the isolates from Oceanobacter kriegii NBRC 15467(T) (Q-8; 91â€Š%). On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic data, including DNA-DNA hybridization, the isolates represent a novel genus and species, for which the name Oleibacter marinus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Oleibacter marinus is 2O1(T) (=NBRC 105760(T) =BTCC B-675(T)).",2011,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology
RisikoabschÃ¤tzung von laMRSA in der Lebensmittelkette - Molekulare Diagnostik als Werkzeug zur AufklÃ¤rung epidemiologischer ZusammenhÃ¤nge,"Methicillin resistente Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sind bei landwirtschaftlichen Nutztieren weit verbreitet.

BIOTECHNO 2016 Proceedings,"We propose a Matroska feature selection method (Method 2) for microarray datasets (the datasets). We had already established a new theory of the discriminant analysis (Theory) and developed an optimal Linear Discriminant Function (OLDF) named Revised IP-OLDF. This LDF can naturally select features for the datasets. The dataset consists of several small genes subspaces that we call small Matroskas (SMs) and are linearly separable. We confirmed this feature selection of Revised IP-OLDF by Swiss banknote data and Japanese automobile data, also. Therefore, we need not struggle with high-dimension genes space. In this paper, we develop a LINGO program to find all SMs and confirm that the dataset consists of disjoint union of SMs and high-dimension subspace that is not linearly separable. Because it is very easy for us to analyze these SMs that are small samples, we may be able to find new facts of gene analysis. Lasso researchers will have better results compared with our results. KeywordsMinimum Number of Misclassifications (MNM); Revised IP-OLDF; SVM; Fisherâ€™s LDF; Gene Analysis; Small Matroska (SM); Basic Gene Subspase (BGS); Lasso. I. INTRODCTION Fisher [6] [7] developed a Linear Discriminant Function (Fisherâ€™s LDF) under Fisherâ€™s assumption and established the theory of discriminant analysis. Because Fisherâ€™s assumption was too strict for the real data, a Quadratic Discriminant Function (QDF) was developed. In addition to two discriminant functions, logistic regression [4] and a Regulalized Discriminant Analysis (RDA) [9] were proposed as the statistical discriminant functions. These statistical discriminant functions apply for many applications, and statistical software packages became essential tools for the science and industries. On the other hand, it is well known that Mathematical Programming (MP) can define the discriminant models [16]. Linear Programming (LP) sets out Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) discriminant function. Quadratic Programming (QP) defines an L2-norm discriminant function (Least square method). Nonlinear Programming (NLP) defines Lp-norm discriminant functions. Before 1997, there were many papers of MP-based discriminant functions summarized by Stam [57]. We think the first generation research ended in 1997 because these researches lacked examination of real data and comparison with statistical discriminant functions. Vapnik [61] proposed three Support Vector Machines (SVMs) such as a Hardmargin SVM (H-SVM), Soft-margin SVM (S-SVM) and kernel SVM in 1995. H-SVM clearly defined a Linearly Separable Data (LSD) and generalization ability. However, because most real data are not LSD, and H-SVM can be used only for LSD, we use S-SVM for actual data. QP defines these SVMs. Although kernel SVM is one of nonlinear discriminant function and provides an attractive idea, we do not discuss it in this research because our concern is a comparison of LDFs. Many researchers use SVMs because there are many examinations of real data compared with the first generation research of MP-based discriminant theory. From 1971 to 1974, we became a member of the project to develop a computer system for an Electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Project leader, Doc. Nomura gave us a theme to develop a diagnostic logic using Fisherâ€™s LDF. Our research was inferior to Nomuraâ€™s experimental decision tree algorithm. At first, we thought this failure was caused by our poor experience and knowledge of statistics. However, we considered the discriminant functions based on the variancecovariance matrices were not suitable for the medical diagnosis discussed in Section II. Moreover, we found all LDFs cannot correctly discriminate the cases on the discriminant hyperplane (Problem 1). In Section II, although Fisher established discriminant analysis based on variance-covariance matrices, we explain a new theory of MP-based discriminant analysis (Theory) [53]. At first, we developed an Optimal LDF based on a Minimum Number of Misclassifications (minimum NM, MNM) criterion (IP-OLDF) in (1) [19] [21]. It reveals two important facts of discriminant analysis. Those are 1) the relation of NM and LDF in the discriminant coefficient space, 2) monotonic decrease of MNM that is very crucial for gene analysis. It shows the good result by comparison with Fisherâ€™s LDF and QDF using Fisherâ€™s iris data [2] and Cephalo Pelvic Disproportion (CPD) data [14]. It finds Swiss banknote data is LSD [8]. All LDFs except for H-SVM and Revised IP-OLDF in (2) cannot discriminate LSD theoretically (Problem 2). Experimentally, Revised LPOLDF in (2), one of L1-norm LDF using LP, can discriminate LSD. Nevertheless, it tends to gather cases on the discriminant hyperplane (Problem 1). Student data [24] reveals the defect of IP-OLDF caused by Problem 1. Therefore, Revised IP-OLDF is developed. It is only LDF to solve Problem 1. The pass/fail determination using exam scores [28] shows the defect of QDF and RDA caused by the defect of generalized inverse of variance-covariance matrices (Problem 3). If we add random noise to constant values of some particular variable, we can solve Problem 3. Japanese automobile data [35] explain Problem 3, also. Because Fisher never formulate the equation of Standard Error (SE) of error rate and discriminant coefficient, discriminant analysis is not traditional inferential statistics based on normal distribution 1 Copyright (c) IARIA, 2016.

Circulating biomarkers may be unable to detect infection at the early phase of sepsis in ICU patients: the CAPTAIN prospective multicenter cohort study,"PurposeSepsis and non-septic systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) are the same syndromes, differing by their cause, sepsis being secondary to microbial infection. Microbiological tests are not enough to detect infection early. While more than 50 biomarkers have been proposed to detect infection, none have been repeatedly validated.AimTo assess the accuracy of circulating biomarkers to discriminate between sepsis and non-septic SIRS.MethodsThe CAPTAIN study was a prospective observational multicenter cohort of 279 ICU patients with hypo- or hyperthermia and criteria of SIRS, included at the time the attending physician considered antimicrobial therapy. Investigators collected blood at inclusion to measure 29 plasma compounds and ten whole blood RNAs, andâ€”for those patients included within working hoursâ€”14 leukocyte surface markers. Patients were classified as having sepsis or non-septic SIRS blindly to the biomarkers results. We used the LASSO method as the technique of multivariate analysis, because of the large number of biomarkers.ResultsDuring the study period, 363 patients with SIRS were screened, 84 having exclusion criteria. Ninety-one patients were classified as having non-septic SIRS and 188 as having sepsis. Eight biomarkers had an area under the receiver operating curve (ROC-AUC) over 0.6 with a 95% confidence interval over 0.5. LASSO regression identified CRP and HLA-DRA mRNA as being repeatedly associated with sepsis, and no model performed better than CRP alone (ROC-AUC 0.76 [0.68â€“0.84]).ConclusionsThe circulating biomarkers tested were found to discriminate poorly between sepsis and non-septic SIRS, and no combination performed better than CRP alone.",2018,Intensive Care Medicine

"Power and Landscape in Atlantic West Africa: Segou, Slavery, and Sifinso","Â© Cambridge University Press 2012. INTRODUCTION Slavery formed a fundamental element in the economic production systems of many historic African states. Such economies, which include documented West African cases, such as the Sokoto Caliphate, Songhai, and Segou, appear to have relied upon an enslaved workforce, derived from warfare, for agricultural production (Lovejoy 2005; Meillassoux 1991; Roberts 1987). The settlement landscape of Segou (c.1700â€“1861) was populated largely by individuals who have been categorized, by both contemporary observers and historians of oral tradition, as slaves (e.g., Park 2000 [1799]; Roberts 1997). Whether cultivators or soldiers, the â€œownershipâ€ of groups of individuals by ruling elites and their emplacement within the state's core landscape appears to have been a major attribute of the Segou state. The present study deals with new enquiries into both the oral history and archaeology of Segou's social landscape, considering it in contrast to the mercantile â€œeternal landscapeâ€ of Marka urban centres. Ultimately, it is hoped that this historical archaeological study will be of relevance to the archaeology of other African polities and will inform approaches to the earlier slave economies of the West African Sahel. The extent to which state-level systems of enslavement existed prior to the sixteenth century is a question fraught with difficulties of definition and perception. As Lovejoy (2000:21) states, â€œthat slavery probably existed in Africa before the diffusion of Islam is relatively certainâ€¦its characteristics are not.â€ Some scholars, such as Kopytoff and Miers (1977), have portrayed African slavery as an indigenous development out of a sliding scale of â€œrights in persons,â€ ranging from bride-price, to indenture, to actual chattel slavery. Such indigenous systems of obligation and caste may have played a role in the advent of social complexity on the continent. Others, such as Meillassoux (1991), have challenged hypotheses of indigenous slavery, arguing that the â€œslave mode of productionâ€ was a contagion spread by contact between the Islamic world and arid West Africa in the ninth century.",2012,
Methodenevaluierung der Quantifizierung verwitterungsrelevanter organischer SÃ¤uren aus BÃ¶den,"Niedermolekulare Organische Sauren (NOS) spielen eine zentrale Rolle bei der pflanzlichen Nahrstoffmobilisierung. Insbesondere fur die Auflosung von Phosphor- (P) und Eisen (Fe)-Mineralen bzw. der Vorbeugung der P-Fallung durch Chelatisierung zweiwertiger Kationen sind diese Verbindungen von erheblicher Bedeutung. Durch eine Absenkung des pH-Wertes erschweren NOS die Bildung sekundarer Minerale. Uber die Komplexierung von Fe oder Calcium (Ca) wird die Verwitterung von primaren Eisenmineralen und Apatit vorangetrieben, wodurch NOS aktiv an der Gesteinsverwitterung beteiligt sind. Eine Quantifizierung der NOS im Boden ist somit unerlasslich um diesen Schlusselprozess der Mineralverwitterung und Pflanzenernahrung genauer zu erfassen.
In der vorliegenden Studie werden drei verschiedene, bereits publizierte Methoden zur Extraktion und anschliesenden Quantifizierung von NOS miteinander verglichen und hinsichtlich ihrer Vor- und Nachteile bezuglich spezifischer Fragestellungen evaluiert. Bei den auf Gaschromatographie-Massenspektrometrie (GC-MS) beruhenden Methoden ist eine Derivatisierung der Analyten notwendig, wobei hier eine Butylierung mit einer Methylierung verglichen wird. Die dritte auf Hochleistungsflussigchromatographie-Massenspektrometrie (HPLC-MS) basierende Methode kommt ohne Derivatisierung der Analyten aus. Die angewendete sequentielle Extraktionsmethode mit 1) der Extraktion wasserloslicher NOS und 2) einer schwach sauren Extraktion erlaubt die Unterscheidung wasserloslicher von mineralassoziierten NOS.
Die Methoden wurden hinsichtlich Nachweisstarke und Reproduzierbarkeit, sowie ihrer Anwendbarkeit fur verschiedener Fragestellungen verglichen. Insbesondere zur Bestimmung von NOS an C-13 markierten Proben ist eine Methode wunschenswert bei dem die Menge an Fremdkohlenstoff im Molekul minimiert wird. Hier stellt die HPLC-MS Methode die beste Alternative dar, bringt jedoch messtechnisch einige Herausforderungen mit sich. Der praparative Aufwand ist deutlich geringer als bei den anderen Methoden, was einen hoheren Probendurchsatz ermoglicht. Allerdings kann mit einer HPLC-MS Methode nicht die Nachweisstarke und Sensitivitat der GC-MS Methoden erreicht werden. Daruber hinaus stellt die Lagerung der mikrobiell extrem schnell abbaubaren NOS als underivatisierte LC-MS Proben oft ein Problem dar; Derivatisierung und nachfolgende Lagerung in organischen Losemitteln verbessern die Haltbarkeit und damit das Zeitfenster fur die Messung erheblich.",2017,

Endoscopic removal techniques and clipping closure for chicken bones wedged transversely in the colon,"To the Editor--We read with great interest the article by Church on successful colonoscopic removal of a chicken bone wedged transversely in the sigmoid co lon) Because each end of the impacted bone penetrated the colon wall, grasping or loosening the bone with endoscopic instruments was difficult. He therefore devised a new technique for removal of such bones. After a sigmoidoscope with a silk tie grasped by biopsy forceps was passed beyond the bone, the tie was released several inches past the bone. The tie was regrasped on the other side of the bone so that the tie encircled the bone. The tie was gently pulled caudally, and then the bone disimpacted. The bone was easily snared and removed. Smith e t a l . 2 and Amann and Somogyi 3 reported a similar technique, a snare and wire-loop technique, for removal of biliary stentts embedded into the duodenal wall opposite the biliary orifice, as a result of distal stent migration, and wedged transversely in the duodenum. After a snare was passed and opened on one side of the embedded stent, a wire passed through the same accessory channel was positioned on the other side of the stent. The wire was passed through the open snare, and the snare was closed tight on the end of the wire, which formed a tight loop around the stent. The stent was easily removed by pulling the snare and the wire against the accessory channel port followed by withdrawal of the duodenoscope. Mergener and Baillie 4 reported another alternative, a guidewire/basket ""lasso"" technique, for removal of such embedded biliary stents. Unlike the snare and wire-loop technique, they used a basket to engage the tip of the guidewire. These techniques using a duodenoscope with a single working channel were simple, rapid, and effective methods and were well tolerated by the patients without resorting to surgical intervention. 2-5 The techniques are also available for chicken bones wedged transversely in the gastrointestinal tract as in Church's patient. Tamasky e t a l . 6 and Rex and Bilot tJ reported successful colonoscopic removal of impacted chicken bones. Because onty one end of the bones penetrated the colon wall, the bones were easily freed from the impaction point by grasping the other end of the bones with a snare or a rat-toothed forceps. In one patient, spiking fevers and development of a perisigmoid abscess, which subsequently required a week of intravenous antibiotic therapy and nothing taken by mouth, followed the removal. Reddy e t al . 8 also reported a similar case of successful colonoscopic removal of an impacted toothpick. Four days aider removal, the patient complained of a two-day history of diarrhea and low-grade fever. Pelvic computed tomography showed perisigmoid inflammation, significant fluid and fat stranding, and a localized pneumoperitoneum, which suggested a localized sigmoid perforation and required a week of intravenous antibiotic therapy. After removal of impacted bones or a toothpick, inflammatory tissue with a central divot was evident at the site of impaction in their patients7 '8 We therefore believe that the presence of the divot suggests that an ""occult"" perforation has occurred, 9 and closure of the divot can reduce significant mortality and morbidity resulting from the perforation. Nonsurgical treatment of colonic perforations is more problematic because of massive contamination of the pecitoneal cavity by intestinal fluid containing large numbers of bacteria. 1Â° Technical improvements in both clips and clip-delivery systems have made clips easier to place, n Recent reports have described successful closures by endoscopic clipping for perforations of esophagus, 12'13 stomach, 11'14 duodenum, 1Â°a5 colon, 16 and anastomosis) 7'~8 The immediate clipping closure of the perforations, preventing any further contamination from gastrointestinal fluid, can contribute to good outcomes, m'~6'.8 Therefore, in an effort to minimize complications and promote rapid healing of the wound, we believe that endoscopic clipping closure of the divot may be reasonable. 9 Although Church's patient recovered without complication after removal of an impacted chicken bone accompanied by sigmoid penetration, endoscopic clipping closure of the divot can certainly prevent contamination of the peritoneal cavity.",2001,Diseases of the Colon & Rectum

Integrating Social Homophily and Network Lasso for Personalized Sentiment Classification,"People often have different opinions toward the same topic, posing challenges for traditional sentiment analysis systems that rely on statistical models estimated with population-level data. Personalization is a solution to the problem, but it suffers from data scarcity issue, as the labeled date for a specific user is usually only available in a small quantity. In this paper, we exploit the theory of social homophily to overcome this difficulty by assuming that social neighbors are likely to express similar opinions with respect to the same topic or document. We present a personalized sentiment analysis system that leverages the social relation information to balance between personalization and overfitting. Our approach is based on network lasso that automatically clusters socially proximate users together, so that users in the same group share the same personalized model. We develop a distributed optimization algorithm that makes our system scale to large networks as well. The experiments on Yelp review datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms competitive methods.",2019,IEEE Access
Iterative minimal residual method provides optimal regularization parameter for extreme learning machines,"Abstract Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network with the learning speed is much faster than the traditional neural network architecture. The main reason is attributed to the application of slow gradient-based algorithms, and the model parameter of the networks is estimated iteratively and hence, ELM has been widely used in real-life applications due to its fast and easy way of learning. The ill-conditioning of the input-toâ€“hidden layer matrix reduces the stability of ELM and the regularization is employed to overcome this problem. In general, Tikhonov ( l 2 -norm based) and Lasso ( l 1 -norm based) techniques are widely used regularization techniques applied in the current work. The choice of the regularization parameter affects the performance of either of the regularized ELM. The singular value decomposition based generalized cross-validation method is also used in the literature for automatically estimating the value of the regularization parameter. This method increases the computational complexity, as it involves the repeated inversion of a large matrix. In the proposed methods, the regularized Minimum Residual Method (MRM) is adopted along with the Golden-section line search to find the optimal value of the regularization parameter. One of the important contributions of the proposed work is to suitably modify MRM to estimate the regularization parameter for the Lasso technique. MT-ELM is a l 2 -norm regularization based ELM method where the regularization parameter is estimated using MRM. Similarly, ML-ELM is a l 1 -norm regularization based ELM method where the regularization parameter is estimated using a suitable MRM. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, experiments are carried out on several benchmark classification data sets and are compared on several performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 -score. Through the extensive numerical results and floating point operation counts, it is shown that the proposed MRM-based methods are capable of estimating the regularization parameter optimally compare to the existing ones. It is also observed that the proposed methods improve the accuracy measure by seven per cent compared to the conventional ELM, thus enhancing the capability of ELM. Further, the proposed methods are verified statistically.",2019,Results in physics
High-Dimensional Predictive Regression in the Presence of Cointegration,"While a great number of predictive variables for stock returns have been suggested, their prediction power is unstable. We propose a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) estimator of a predictive regression in which stock returns are conditioned on a large set of lagged covariates, some of which are highly persistent and potentially cointegrated. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed LASSO estimator and validate our theoretical findings using simulation studies. The application of this proposed LASSO approach to forecasting stock returns suggests that cointegrating relationships among the persistent predictors leads to a significant improvement in the prediction of stock returns over various competing models in the mean squared error sense.",2020,Journal of Econometrics
